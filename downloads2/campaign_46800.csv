with an unparalleled security</u></b></p>
<p>Many Bitcoin users already had their accounts'
private keys stolen, either because they have entrusted their keys to online
services with a defaulting security (see the MtGox scandal), or because they've
been direct victims of local attacks (malware, trojans...) on their personal
computers or smart phones.</p>
<p><b><u>The smart card
protects the keys…</u></b></p>
<p>PRISMicide for Bitcoin allows each user to
secure its private key within a smart card. These private keys are then used
directly via the smart card to sign the transactions as requested by its owner
but will never be exposed to the potentially compromised computers, smartphones
or tablets that are used to perform these transactions.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692940/files/20140703160355-bitcoin_smartcard.png?1404428635"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b><u>… and the small portable player secure the use of the card</u></b></p>
<p>Although the keys are protected against theft,
they must also be protected from hidden misuse. Indeed, some attackers distort
approved transactions: the owner of an account believes he is validating a
small transaction towards one of his friends' account, as indicated on his
computer screen (or smart phone), but he is actually validating a transaction
that empties his account, sending the bitcoins to the pirate's account.</p>
<p>The small secured portable player makes that
type of attack impossible by posting on its own screen the real details of the
transaction requested prior its validation. It's also on this player that the
PIN code of the smart card is entered.</p>
<p>Users have a personal terminal for payments
that they can use and trust even on unsecured computers or smartphones and
also, with potentially compromised third parties (i.e. Shop POS).</p><p><b>Hierarchical Deterministic (BIP 32) Wallet</b><br/></p><p>The card holds a Hierarchical Deterministic (BIP 32) Wallet seed - which means that if a user have backed up this seed, he is able to regenerate all his private keys generated by the card. The PRISMicide reader let users do this backup when the seed is generated during first time setup. (Optionnaly, users can enter their own seed).</p><p></p><p><b>Multisig support</b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">PRISMicide can create and use escrow accounts through ""2 of 2"", ""2 of 3"" and ""3 of 3"" P2SH multisignature adresses. </span><br/></p><p>P2SH addresses can be generated on the PRISMicide terminal by inserting several 
cards and choose the required cooperation ""2 of 2"", ""2 of 3"" and ""3 of

<p></p></div>","September 1,  2014 : Final announcement
PRISMicide for Bitcoin project has been renamed Bitcoin Pinpad : www.bitcoinpinpad.comPRISMicide hardware board part is now called Origami Board : www.origamiboard.comPRISMicide pro-privacy foundation opens its new website : www.prismicide.comThank You all for the donations and preorders done here through Indiegogo or with bitcoins. Please Check the new websites above for the last updates!ARCHIVED DESCRIPTION :The new security PRISMcide solution consists of
""open source"" smart cards and of a small ""open hardware""
portable player that can be used with Android and iOS smartphones and tablets
via bluetooth and also, via USB with Windows, Mac OS and Linux computers. It is 
Open source smart card based security development platform + Multiplatform portable reader  = Best secure hardware wallet for crypto-currencies
PRISMicide
democratizes security solutions based on the banking industry and
telecommunications smart cards.A Bitcoin wallet
with an unparalleled security
Many Bitcoin users already had their accounts'
private keys stolen, either because they have entrusted their keys to online
services with a defaulting security (see the MtGox scandal), or because they've
been direct victims of local attacks (malware, trojans...) on their personal
computers or smart phones.
The smart card
protects the keys…
PRISMicide for Bitcoin allows each user to
secure its private key within a smart card. These private keys are then used
directly via the smart card to sign the transactions as requested by its owner
but will never be exposed to the potentially compromised computers, smartphones
or tablets that are used to perform these transactions.… and the small portable player secure the use of the card
Although the keys are protected against theft,
they must also be protected from hidden misuse. Indeed, some attackers distort
approved transactions: the owner of an account believes he is validating a
small transaction towards one of his friends' account, as indicated on his
computer screen (or smart phone), but he is actually validating a transaction
that empties his account, sending the bitcoins to the pirate's account.
The small secured portable player makes that
type of attack impossible by posting on its own screen the real details of the
transaction requested prior its validation. It's also on this player that the
PIN code of the smart card is entered.
Users have a personal terminal for payments
that they can use and trust even on unsecured computers or smartphones and
also, with potentially compromised third parties (i.e. Shop POS).Hierarchical Deterministic (BIP 32) WalletThe card holds a Hierarchical Deterministic (BIP 32) Wallet seed - which means that if a user have backed up this seed, he is able to regenerate all his private keys generated by the card. The PRISMicide reader let users do this backup when the seed is generated during first time setup. (Optionnaly, users can enter their own seed).Multisig supportPRISMicide can create and use escrow accounts through ""2 of 2"", ""2 of 3"" and ""3 of 3"" P2SH multisignature adresses. P2SH addresses can be generated on the PRISMicide terminal by inserting several 
cards and choose the required cooperation ""2 of 2"", ""2 of 3"" and ""3 of 
3"". Then you can unlock funds 
sent to this address by inserting the right number of cards depending on
 the chosen escrow model to sign the transaction.Why Hardware Wallets are so important ?Let's quote two great speakers...""We need to make it easier for mainstream users to use Bitcoin securely. [...] Hardware Wallets, which are basically devices that can securely hold you bitcoin and allow you to transact bitcoins, are going to become very important in 2014 because for most people, their general purpose PC or Macintosh computers or their Android or iOS phone is not exactly secure""Andreas AntonopoulosMay, 21th 2014""Today there is no bank that says you can use any virus infested computers and safely access your bank account and today you can do that with Bitcoin: You can log on to a virus infested computer and using a hardware wallet, not have any concerns about using a virus infected computer to do your transactions and that's really different.""David Silva Smith2014 Coin CongressThose preliminary specifications may change during the final component selection.Reader:- ARM Cortex M4 family CPU (2Mo Flash)- Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) module- Micro USB port for charging battery and PC/MAC communication- Full USB port as expansion slot- 3.2"" TFT 240*320 or 400- DecKa OS for Cortex M4 (open source branch)Smart Card: - ARM secure core based chipset- DecKa OS for ARM secure core (open source branch)DecKa OS is a security features focused operating system. It was mostly developed for secure elements like smart cards.This OS is already used inside deployed solutions. Recent releases were used by USB smart cards from hardwarewallet.com that are available here as perks and easy-to-play-with smart card based solution (with open API).DecKa OS was adapted to be used on ""larger"" core like Cortex M4 based CPU.Decka OS aleady exists as a closed source solution. A first open source branch will be opened for this project, thanks to the great help of BTChip.com. TeamHere is a brief introduction of the ""public"" part of our team. If you want to read more information on someone, please use his Linkedin profile link.PRISMicide is a registered non profit Organization.Frédéric MARTIN / PRISMicide Co-founder (Linkedin Profile)System Architect. Frederic is working for more than eight years inside the smart card industry and was getting tired to wait for a fully open source smart card platform to build secure solutions he can trust on every levels...Nicolas BACCA / PRISMicide Co-founder (Linkedin Profile)Smart Card Security Expert. Nicolas is specialized in Secure embedded development and working since 2000 for major smart card industry players. He already backuped Bitcoin related projects like btchip.com and hardwarewallet.com.Olivier Tomaz (Linkedin Profile) Information technology engineer, security designer and digital security architect. Olivier is working inside the smart card industry for more than seven years. He likes to play on swings too. :)Laurent Fazio (Linkedin Profile)Embedded Developer. Open source technologies enthousiast, Laurent worked as multimedia set top boxes Linux Engineer, smartgrid embeded sensors developer and team leader for a Linux distribution editor.Yannick Almeras (Linkedin Profile)Electronic Engineer. Yannick has a wide experience in electronic hardware design and prototyping, from sonars to wireless communication systems and related certifications.Few other guys joined the team but simply did not want to share their private information here.MotivationThe PRISMicide project community's security professionals share the same conclusions and observations:
●  the need for effective security
tools to prevent hackers or isolated scrupulous government programs (i.e. NSA/PRISM scandal) attacks 
●  the absence of fully open source
solutions that use secure reliable elements such as smart cards
●  the low security software
environments used by smart phones and tablets
●  the increase in piracy-related
attacks linked with crypto-currencies like Bitcoin
The main goal of PRISMicide project is to provide the perfect platform for the
development of security services such as data encryption, electronic signature,
online authentication, SMS encryption or ultra-secure messaging.We'll add questions and answers during the campaign...Anyway, the first application available immediately with the platform will be a secured materialized wallet (""hardware wallet"") for Bitcoin users. We don't start from nothing. Your money will be used to finalize and accelerate project development.  Please remember PRISMicide is a registered non-profit organization. We already invested great amounts of our time and money into this project because we want this platform to be available for our own needs... We hope this crowdfunding campaign will cover parts of our investment. Our official initial goal is to raise 40 000$. This should only cover very basic costs. We'll probably have to reach 60 000$ to cover most of essential costs. 70 000$ would allow to cover the 3d printer cost.  That's why stretch goals starts at 80 000$ (see below).We already...- have our own smart card operating system (years of work, this is an open source branch of the professional work of BTChip.com)- hardware wallet application- built our dream team- made the feasibility study and cost estimationWe need to...- physically evaluate few different components to make our final parts selection- complete the electronic design- develop the basic Android and iPhone Bitcoin application- make one or two PCB testings/rounds for prototypes- start first batch productionBonus video of our Raspberry Pi based prototype that was used to show what future user experience should be:  PRISMicide smart cards and readers should be available by the end of this year. We should be able to stick to this date if this campaign meets a great success. What we'll do:- Weekly updates on blog/twitter. We mean it.- No unexplained delay, if temporary shit happens, we'll tell you so- We know our first prototype run will not be perfect, This is why we take this into account. Money and agenda are planned for three rounds of prototype. Delivered products will not be alpha releases.- As stated below, we won't use solid molds, so no useless wait for casing.A quick note from the backers perspective : Some of our team members already participated to crowdfunding campaign as backers and sometimes, project owners treated backers with disrespect: no updates, no answers, no real consideration. No way, we won't act like that.A real challenge. Front: LCD touch screenBack: Smart card slotWe don't want to have to wait months to have plastic injection molds. We thought using 3D printers and publish 3D casing files would be better. So we'll use 3D printers to build casing and you'll be able to do so too...Later, we'll probably make other ""non-3D printers based"" compatible casings available... but for now we all agree we need to go fast and open :)
See below to preorder perks with Bitcoins
Bitcoin prices at the lower right of each perk box.SHIPMENT COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED : WE DO NOT WANT TO CHARGE EVERYONE THE SAME HIGH COSTS FOR EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD. Some people want costly express services, some people don't.... some others want warranty or tracking services... so everyone will be contacted later to choose shipment according their location and expectations.USB readers are here to simplify tests and direct smart card access from PC and MAC computers. This is very useful when debugging and developing applications. (These readers won't be part of the final PRISMicide solution).IF YOU WANT TO PREORDER WITH BITCOINS, PLEASE CONTACT PREORDER@PRISMICIDE.COMWhat are USB Smart Cards ? USB smart cards from hardwarewallet.com (developed by BTChip) are closed source USB small devices that are not part of PRISMicide platform but share most parts of the APDU API (we have common team elements).USB smart cards are a great way to experience smart card based hardware wallets. They can be used as stand alone USB keys.They are available here as perks because :
We all have enough T-shirts :)
it is fun to promote a low cost hardware wallet too
BTChip helps this project to raise more money through these perks
if you want more information about these USB smart cards, go to the official hardwarewallet.com website.USB Smart cards are not compatible with PRISMicide reader.ONLY ISO/standard smart cards (like PRISMicide ones) can be used inside PRISMicide readers. By the way, if you have smart card development skill, please remember you can develop your own smart card solution (you are not forced to use our smart cards).What is the USB reader ? It is a simple standard smart card reader with USB connectivity. Not built by our team, it is a simple product and an easy tool to test, develop and diagnose PRISMicide smart cards without having to use the full PRISMicide reader. Binaries (with source code) for Windows/Mac/Linux will be bundled with this small reader to help you to play with the PRISMicide smart card APDU API.When we talk about this project to developers, hacktivists and ""ordinary"" people, lots of projects are often mentioned. So we already have many future projects and groups of people gathering around these ideas.Let's be optimistic and imagine we can reach those goals below... here is the project that will be accelerated / focused on:80 000 $ Focus on... SMS Encryption application90 000 $Newbie compliant PRISMicide smart Card introduction & documentationDecKa OS development crash course and basic video tutorials100 000$Focus on... File Encryption features and GnuPG / GPG supportIf these stretch goals are not reached, these features/services and other ones will only be delayed.

Im looking to turn my passion for fashion and rock into a business called SurferRosa Trading Co. where i can buy and sell unique products at events and festivals to supplement my income while still spending valuable time with my family. My first product for SurferRosa will be headwear that you can wear many different ways. They have great designs and styles that can be used with versatility and function. Check out the video and see for yourself. Our extra expenses are spent getting Michelle through nursing school, so you can imagine why i am asking for your help getting started. Your contributions will go toward start up expenses for the business and product staging (tables, tablecloths, stands, etc..) . I need funds to set up a website and secure larger events and display my product properly and also to discover other unique brands that fit the SurferRosa profile in the future. Like Worm from the movie Rounders said, ""I've got the knife and a fork, the table is all set. All I need now is the stake."" I can make this a profitable venture for my family with your help. If you can contribute, I hope you will be a part of this with me. There are some perks waiting for you. If you can't donate, please share with your friends on social media. Like our page on Facebook. Everything helps! Thanks for viewing and Rock on!Jayson Vasquez/ SurferRosa Trading Co.Thesquez23@yahoo.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Charlotte Burkhart. I live in Wellington New Zealand, and i have been running my small jewellery business L.S.D.(Little Sister Desings) For 4 Years. I adore creating and designing jewellery, it is more than just a business to me it is my passion. I love to make unique jewellery that inspires people, and helps them show their individuality. My jewellery is very dark, mysterious and beautiful. A lot of it contains replica castings of human teeth, bird claws, bones and re-thought replicas of antique / art nouveau Rings. My new line would continue on this idea and expand, using beautiful custom cut gemstones like moonstone, labradorite and Onyx. </p>
<p>I sell my jewellery mostly online through <a href=""http://www.charlotteburkhart.etsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">etsy</a>, but also have my own beautiful <a href=""http://www.littlesisterdesigns.co.nz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> i created last year.</p>
<p>I am starting this campaign because I am bursting with new ideas for my new 2013 Range ""The Killing Moon"", but unfortunately i don't have the means to fund every good idea i have. I have created several new pieces in ""The Killing Moon"" Collection, but i need your help to complete the collection. The good news is every contribution will get a 20% off code that will go towards the new collection when it is completed (Or towards any of the current items if you are so inclined).</p>
<p>If i reach my minimum goal i will be able to creatue at <em>leas</em>t 5 new designs to go towards my 2013 collection. Five may not sound like much, but a lot of costs accumulate with each design in the production process. but the more money that is funded the more L.S.D. i can create!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>The funding needed will go towards these costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting Moulds made of each item, so it can be reproduced, (Approx $50 per mould, $250 total for 5 moulds)</li>
<li>Buying &amp; Getting bulk Semi Precious Stones made and cut to the specifications i need (Approx $10-$35 per stone, and i would need to buy bulk, and this could cost up to $800) </li>
<li>Supplies like chain, findings etc.</li>
<li>Getting the Jewellery Cast in to Sterling Silver and Bronze (Depends on how many castings i get done of each but i would need at least $400 to get a few castings of each piece. </li>
<li>A portion of the funds will be used for shipping your perks, but this has been added to the price of each perk. Therefore, if i meet $1500 goal on here i will have to set aside an amount for shipping (It could be several hundred dollars). Therefore i hope to raise more than the goalset so i can reach the true target.</li>
<li>Even If i don't reach my goal, i will still get as many items cast and created possible, and you will still receive your perks. Every contribution helps and is greatly appreciated and will help expand my store!</li>
</ul>
<p>If i exceed my goal (Wow!) here is what i will do with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1800: Create another piece and get it moulded and cast ready for production</li>
<li>$2000: Create another two pieces and get moulded and cast ready for production</li>
<li>$2100: the above and also create a new one of a kind piece</li>
<li>$2500: the above and also get a new range of custom foil stamped, luxurious leather boxes created with the logo L.S.D.</li>
<li>$2700: The above and also a range of postcards/flyers to promote my work in stores</li>
<li>$3000: All of the above and more one of a kind &amp; gallery pieces</li>
<li>All money raised will go towards the making of my new range, promotion and packaging.</li>
</ul>

<p>
</p><h3><br/></h3><h3><b>1. Who are you?</b></h3>
<p>We are athletes with a
vision! The sports and social project, <b>Leopard Lengerich e.V.</b>, was
launched in 2004 by Yako Alarslan. Our mission has always been, and will remain as
such, to offer children, adolescents and young adults an alternative
to boredom, drugs and violence. Unfortunately, all of these dominate
the lives of many young people. Through <b>Taekwondo</b>, <b>hip hop dance</b> and
<b>Kick-Thaiboxing-K1</b>, our organization enables healthy, constructive
ways to break vicious circles and master similar life difficulties.
Leopard Lengerich e.V. is a <b>nonprofit-organization</b>, officially
recognized by Germany as such.<span></span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Our athletic departments
combine physical workout with psychological elements such as body
language, breathing and voice. Course participants will be able to
carry on in life with strengthened self-confidence. In addition to
the pleasant side effect of athletic achievements, our primary focus
lies on social and integrative commitments. Our organization takes
volunteering very seriously and is pleased with the active
participation of our coaches, parents, students and friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the high
dedication displayed by our coaches, athletic successes at national
and international levels were soon to follow. Since 2009, several
German, European and world championship titles have been won by our
athletes. Furthermore, our organization is represented at state level
and even within the German Taekwondo national team itself. The most
successful and famous member of Leopard Lengerich e.V. is <b>Levent
Tuncat</b>, participant of the Olympic Games Beijing 2008 and Germany's
choice for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 in the category men's 58 kg
Taekwondo competition.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430502846/t8vzow0jbjzv9qdsqjov.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430502919/zrdy75rpmsmkecbv0bix.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>2. What will you do
with the money?</b></h3>
<p>Helping people help
themselves! The athletic departments of Leopard Lengerich e.V. have garnered respect within Germany continuously. Our prospects team
consists of unique talents of both sexes and diverse age ranges.
Leopard Lengerich e.V. is the only nonprofit-organization in Germany,
perhaps Europe or even worldwide that generates such successful,
exceptional athletes. A fact that must be noted expressly – we have
always funded ourselves entirely and successfully; no support from
sponsors.</p><p>Having stated this, the unprecedented success of our
members have catapulted our expenses to increasingly exorbitant
levels. We wish and must continue to support our athletes in their
(further) development. However, we are not asking for a donation,
quite the contrary. Supported by <b>Levent Tuncat</b>, we want to provide all sports fans, as well as the Taekwondo martial arts as such,
something in and of itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Leopard Lengerich e.V.</b> has
created the fashion and sports brand <b>LT54</b>, not only to continue to
meet our organization's financial and development needs, but also to
dress all sports fans in practical and stylish fashion. We
will start by providing elegant, comfortable <b>presentation suits /
tracksuits</b>. They are made of cotton, available in 128, 140, 156, 164, 176, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430876159/exbihrgcveklbo165qe8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430876537/drjimk4qnrkawpqq9b8t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430876683/hv4njgsu9nu1lizrvxod.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<p>LT54 will provide
outstanding equipment as well, starting with a never before seen
<b>Taekwondo target pad</b>. It represents an evolution on how to train your
kicks. We have developed and improved our unique Taekwondo target pad
for over two years continuously – a full year of research &amp; development and over a year of testing / quality management.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Levent Tuncat </b>has shown it to his peers
in the <b>German Taekwondo national team</b>, its trainers and staff,
various <b>Olympic</b>, <b>world</b>, <b>European</b> and <b>Asian champions</b> as well as other
elite Taekwondo practitioners. It has been tested by such champions as <span><strong>Servet Tazegül</strong></span>, <span><strong>Aaron Cook</strong></span>, <span><strong>Aziz Acharki</strong></span>, <span><strong>Dong-Eon Lee</strong></span>, <span><strong>Bahri Tanrikulu</strong></span>, <span><strong>Reshmie Oogink</strong></span> and <span><strong>Jaouad Achab</strong></span> extensively, in our
own club as well.</p><p>Reactions to our custom Taekwondo target pad have
been exceptionally positive. Now we want to share our secret with the
rest of the world. Before we can release more information however, or
even go as far as market them appropriately, we also wish to <b>patent</b> / <b>trademark</b> our development.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430877033/xet2p28tzkms8uwmmwxo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We have a few dozen
items of our first product in our hands already, the presentation suit / tracksuit mentioned above. This campaign aims to ensure the
<b>continued production</b> of this item, generate the <b>first commercial
batch</b> of our Taekwondo target pads and finance our <b>online portal's 
launch</b>; web development, hosting / server,
administration, maintenance, etc. Any <b>surplus</b> will go into
development and manufacture of new products and to support our mission.</p><p><br/></p><h4>This campaign intends to cover the various costs of a proper market launch:<br/>

</p><h3><b>3. Why crowdfunding?</b></h3>
<p>Together we are strong! We
have been able to pre-finance the previous stages of development on
our own so far. However, crucial steps remain to be taken. We have
been searching for sponsors for months now, without noteworthy
success unfortunately. We have taken notice, with some regret, that
neither the regional industry nor other German ""big players""
are willing, at times without any feedback given, to support this
unique and successful project in Germany. Meanwhile, crowdfunding has
risen, also in Germany, displaying great potential. Well thought out
concepts can reach a greater support through small amounts than by
""large contributions"" of a precious few investment banks,
multinational corporations or public funds.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>4. Are there risks to
this campaign?</b></h3>
<p>No arrogance intended, but
risks are either nonexistent or minimal at worst! <b>Leopard Lengerich
e.V. thrives for over 10 years successfully</b>! All planning aspects,
production and distribution have been set up already and are on
schedule. Our regional sports press coverage is relatively large, goods storage and
distribution channels are secure. Our website is just being
developed, making it our most current matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since our foundation, we
have successfully managed complex events and championships as well as
the development of our athletes' careers, both nationally and
internationally, even as far as participating in the Olympic Games.
To increase your confidence in us even further, we introduce you to
an ambitious project that we have been managing since January 2015.
Parallel to this campaign, we want to promote the sport of Taekwondo
in football-centric Germany and Europe. To this end, we are also
hosting an event of superlatives, the ""<b>1st International
Taekwondo Training-Camp with the World Stars</b>,"" which will run
from May 22nd through 24th, 2015 in Lengerich, Germany.</p><p>At least one
of this campaign's perks will let you attend the event, either with
special rates or other benefits. Over 200 athletes from all over
Europe, America and Asia have registered already. The registration
fees finance its realization already. This campaign shall enhance the
success of the Taekwondo Training-Camp as well, thus enhancing the success of
the LT54 brand launch even further.<b><br/></b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FFKliul54W00%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFKliul54W00&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FFKliul54W00%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h3>

language, breathing and voice. Course participants will be able to
carry on in life with strengthened self-confidence. In addition to
the pleasant side effect of athletic achievements, our primary focus
lies on social and integrative commitments. Our organization takes
volunteering very seriously and is pleased with the active
participation of our coaches, parents, students and friends.

Thanks to the high
dedication displayed by our coaches, athletic successes at national
and international levels were soon to follow. Since 2009, several
German, European and world championship titles have been won by our
athletes. Furthermore, our organization is represented at state level
and even within the German Taekwondo national team itself. The most
successful and famous member of Leopard Lengerich e.V. is Levent
Tuncat, participant of the Olympic Games Beijing 2008 and Germany's
choice for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 in the category men's 58 kg
Taekwondo competition.

2. What will you do
with the money?
Helping people help
themselves! The athletic departments of Leopard Lengerich e.V. have garnered respect within Germany continuously. Our prospects team
consists of unique talents of both sexes and diverse age ranges.
Leopard Lengerich e.V. is the only nonprofit-organization in Germany,
perhaps Europe or even worldwide that generates such successful,
exceptional athletes. A fact that must be noted expressly – we have
always funded ourselves entirely and successfully; no support from
sponsors.Having stated this, the unprecedented success of our
members have catapulted our expenses to increasingly exorbitant
levels. We wish and must continue to support our athletes in their
(further) development. However, we are not asking for a donation,
quite the contrary. Supported by Levent Tuncat, we want to provide all sports fans, as well as the Taekwondo martial arts as such,
something in and of itself.

Leopard Lengerich e.V. has
created the fashion and sports brand LT54, not only to continue to
meet our organization's financial and development needs, but also to
dress all sports fans in practical and stylish fashion. We
will start by providing elegant, comfortable presentation suits /
tracksuits. They are made of cotton, available in 128, 140, 156, 164, 176, S, M, L, XL, and XXL.
LT54 will provide
outstanding equipment as well, starting with a never before seen
Taekwondo target pad. It represents an evolution on how to train your
kicks. We have developed and improved our unique Taekwondo target pad
for over two years continuously – a full year of research & development and over a year of testing / quality management.Levent Tuncat has shown it to his peers
in the German Taekwondo national team, its trainers and staff,
various Olympic, world, European and Asian champions as well as other
elite Taekwondo practitioners. It has been tested by such champions as Servet Tazegül, Aaron Cook, Aziz Acharki, Dong-Eon Lee, Bahri Tanrikulu, Reshmie Oogink and Jaouad Achab extensively, in our
own club as well.Reactions to our custom Taekwondo target pad have
been exceptionally positive. Now we want to share our secret with the
rest of the world. Before we can release more information however, or
even go as far as market them appropriately, we also wish to patent / trademark our development.We have a few dozen
items of our first product in our hands already, the presentation suit / tracksuit mentioned above. This campaign aims to ensure the
continued production of this item, generate the first commercial
batch of our Taekwondo target pads and finance our online portal's 
launch; web development, hosting / server,
administration, maintenance, etc. Any surplus will go into
development and manufacture of new products and to support our mission.This campaign intends to cover the various costs of a proper market launch:


3. Why crowdfunding?
Together we are strong! We
have been able to pre-finance the previous stages of development on
our own so far. However, crucial steps remain to be taken. We have
been searching for sponsors for months now, without noteworthy
success unfortunately. We have taken notice, with some regret, that
neither the regional industry nor other German ""big players""
are willing, at times without any feedback given, to support this
unique and successful project in Germany. Meanwhile, crowdfunding has
risen, also in Germany, displaying great potential. Well thought out
concepts can reach a greater support through small amounts than by
""large contributions"" of a precious few investment banks,
multinational corporations or public funds.

4. Are there risks to
this campaign?
No arrogance intended, but
risks are either nonexistent or minimal at worst! Leopard Lengerich
e.V. thrives for over 10 years successfully! All planning aspects,
production and distribution have been set up already and are on
schedule. Our regional sports press coverage is relatively large, goods storage and
distribution channels are secure. Our website is just being
developed, making it our most current matter.

Since our foundation, we
have successfully managed complex events and championships as well as
the development of our athletes' careers, both nationally and
internationally, even as far as participating in the Olympic Games.
To increase your confidence in us even further, we introduce you to
an ambitious project that we have been managing since January 2015.
Parallel to this campaign, we want to promote the sport of Taekwondo
in football-centric Germany and Europe. To this end, we are also
hosting an event of superlatives, the ""1st International
Taekwondo Training-Camp with the World Stars,"" which will run
from May 22nd through 24th, 2015 in Lengerich, Germany.At least one
of this campaign's perks will let you attend the event, either with
special rates or other benefits. Over 200 athletes from all over
Europe, America and Asia have registered already. The registration
fees finance its realization already. This campaign shall enhance the
success of the Taekwondo Training-Camp as well, thus enhancing the success of
the LT54 brand launch even further.
5. Any further info?
We appreciate your support
and say THANK YOU! Should you be short of funds momentarily, then
spread the word about this campaign and share it on all channels you
use.We offer all products at reduced prices; early bird or not. Each and every LT54 campaign backer is getting a good value for his or her money. Prices will be adjusted once the campaign is over.Stylish T-shirts, made just for this campaign, are being developed at this moment. 
Therefore, we will be able to start delivering them in July already. 
They are made of cotton and feature modern short sleeves, available in 110-116, 122-128, 134-140, 146-152, 158-164, S, M, L, XL, and XXL. We demand high
 quality end products, thus these T-shirts are not average, cheap mass productions so often found among this kind of clothing. The following picture shows our initial concept. We will display further pictures, including models, in due time:Please notice that our ""1st International
Taekwondo Training-Camp with the World Stars"" starts on May 22nd; a mere three weeks time. If you wish to attend, regardless of this campaign's wrap up, you should make haste in regards to perk booking and travel preparations. More information on this event can be found on our website.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>Hello! My name is Austin Bentley. I work primarily as a freelance designer for musicians. As a youngling, I was always drawn to band shirts that stood out from the crowd. This gave me the desire to add to this outlandish enterprise!</p>
<p>Over the past months, I've had constant questions from friends and fans as to why I don't sell my designs on my own shirts? Time, and money. To invest into something like this is just something I can't do on my own! That's where this campaign comes in.</p>
<p>The idea is simple..! I have 3 designs that I drew up that have gotten some great feedback from fans like you! I plan to print these shirts for everyone, but the first step is too big to take for myself. The money it will cost to get these printed is $1200 dollars, an amount that I can simply not afford without help. So here's the deal- You help me, I help you! Depending on how much you donate, you get some neat perks! By donating, not only are you fueling my passion as an artist and fulfilling my dreams as a designer, you'll get some neat shirts!</p>
<p>Should this campaign be successful, the amount of exposure and promotion I will recieve simply from you wearing my art will be exponential, and I will be truly in the debt of my fans. As I already am for the support up until this point. Without your help, I'm doomed!</p>
<p>I have always been amazed by the power of one individual when they put their mind to something, and even more so by the power of a group of people working together. It is my hope that I can encourage you to join me on my mission to change the face of apparel.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Plain and simple, <strong>I need $1200 dollars to get these shirts printed (150 shirts in total)</strong>. This is the exact amount to get it done, meaning I am to make no profit on this. Your money goes directly into the making of these shirts, and then directly to you. Keep in mind, if I do not meet my goal you will recieve a full refund for the amount you pledged.</div>

We are asking for $27,000 to build a modest starting inventory, help promote the brand, pay for storage of our goods, and to fairly reimburse all the artists who have made or will be making contributions to Class Struggle Clothing getting off the ground. 
To thank you for your support we will be offering your choice of our five designs on either a t-shirt or a hooded sweatshirt depending on the level of your contribution. We think the designs are pretty cool and hope you will too! 
Even if we fall a bit short of our goal of raising $27,000, Class Struggle will still be making a serious effort to pursue our vision. Our projected starting inventory may have to be reduced in the event that our goal is not reached, but you can rest assured we will still make a go of it! 
After the campaign is over, we'll send you a personal email so you can select the size, colour and design you want. We'll also keep you updated as to when you will receive your perk! The ImpactNot only will you get a really cool t-shirt or hoodie for your contribution to Class Struggle Clothing's Indiegogo campaign, you will also be helping to kickstart a company that is focused on improving the work environments that clothing is manufactured in. We know that buying from socially conscious manufacturers like Jerico is a good start, but eventually we want to use our profits to expand Class Struggle Clothing to have our own facilities in nations where people experience unfair and unsafe working conditions. We want everyone involved to be reimbursed fairly for their contributions. We hope you can get behind our brand and support a good cause that has the potential to really make a difference worldwide!70/30 Bamboo/cotton V-neck T-shirts & Racerback Tank Tops*These are digitally produced images and it cannot be guaranteed that the final products will appear exactly as they do in the photos.

While I thought it would be convenient and economical to remain in Europe after finishing my teaching term in Spain this past December (in the case that I was accepted to UNIDEE) it turns out that it was actually not a good idea. Though I was originally told by the German and Italian embassies that I could apply in Germany, I must be in Washington, DC to apply for my visa to Italy.

If I don't raise the funds I'll unfortunately lose the $12,000 grant that I JUST earned by default because I won't be able to apply for my visa or fund my entire research project on my own. </p>

I have been selected by Cittadellarte-Fondazione Pistoletto as the Zegna artist-in-residence. I will reside in Biella, Italy at the University of Ideas (UNIDEE) for a total of 4 months, from June 15 through October 15, 2011. My missions entail researching ethics and sustainability in the fashion industry. 

The $12,000 grant covers my stay at UNIDEE (room, board, tuition), however I will need an additional 
$4799 to cover:♥personal expenses June-October, 2011
♥travel and basic accommodations: Milan, Paris and small textile towns in Italy, all research related
♥professional enrichment (MCAD Citizen Design course)
(Just accepted to the MCAD Sustainable Design Professional Program!)
♥Creative Suite 5 Student Edition design software
♥Digital SLR Camera 

PERKS ---->>>> (look to the right!)

all perks that you see to the right include the previous perk(s)
 e.g.
if you give $25 you get a custom postcard of me, hard at work in Italy AND a thank you on my website.
if you give $50 you get a print, a postcard and a thank you
etc.







REALITY BITES

I first need to get stateside (currently in Germany with my sister) in order to apply for my visa to Italy. This is urgent! While I thought it would be convenient and economical to remain in Europe after finishing my teaching term in Spain this past December (in the case that I was accepted to UNIDEE) it turns out that it was actually not a good idea. Though I was originally told by the German and Italian embassies that I could apply in Germany, I must be in Washington, DC to apply for my visa to Italy. UNIDEE will fly me from NY to Milan roundtrip as part of my grant for the 15 June start date once I make it home.

The reality is that I've worked really hard to present this to the world! I've pulled countless all-nighters working on my doctoral research, my blog and on this video. And for the past two years, I've persistently pursued this dream. More importantly, I've worked hard because I genuinely want to improve lives using design. It's my passion. I can't imagine doing anything else. If I don't raise the funds I'll unfortunately lose the $12,000 grant that I JUST earned by default because I won't be able to apply for my visa or fund my entire research project on my own. 
So here's a bit more about what I do :)

ETHICS VS. AESTHETICS ETHICS + AESTHETICS 

Though the aesthetics of fashion are exhilarating, environmentally sustainable practices and socially responsible behavior are hugely lacking in this multi-billion dollar industry. With my work I will strive to awaken a consciousness of fair trade and bio-ethical fashion that supports the creation of sustainable livelihoods for at-risk, Base of the Pyramid (BoP) populations without sacrificing the aesthetics of the “it” bag.

Equipped with my ideas, a notebook and a camera, I will provide an insider’s view into an industry that has historically provided little supply chain visibility and resisted business models that lend to transparency.

SUSTAINABILITY

I will focus on the sustainability practices of the Italian fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna and the Italian textile industry at large in order to provide corporate social responsibility (CSR) guidelines to fashion industry professionals. I will document my work via written reports (which I will submit for publication), blog posts, and photographs (which I will submit to the Inside Out Project). Please visit http://ethos-diseno.tumblr.com/unidee for full details.

THE IMPACT OF YOUR SUPPORT

By supporting me you will contribute to a more socially and environmentally responsible fashion industry and help a girl’s dream come true! Any funds that exceed the requested amount will go toward paying Gambian seamstresses fair wages for manufacturing sustainable school uniforms for Gambian girls in an effort to promote equitable education and empower women seeking dignified work. So please try to go above and beyond the goal! It will go to a great cause!

I believe that the beauty of fashion is most striking when it is refashioned to fight the 8 anti-poverty goals known as the Millennium Development Goals(MDGs). However, when we talk about refashioning fast fashion, we’re talking about a process not a trend. It therefore goes without saying, that this mission is just one step in a much greater process to which I will dedicate my life’s work. The money that you pledge will sustain my work in Italy which will provide a foundation for future missions and allow me to continue once my time at UNIDEE has culminated.

A UNITED, INTERDISCIPLINARY EFFORT

While it is easier to leave design for the creatives, poverty reduction for the economists, education for teachers and the formation of global partnerships to the diplomats, it is much more effective to combine our efforts using an interdisciplinary approach.
Your support will equip me with access to the resources most essential to my research and creative work.

I am a huge fan of vintage military watches and I have spent years building up a modest collection. However, the watch that I could never find to complete it was the first ever military watch and the grandfather of every military watch in existence: the trench watch. The original WW1-era trench watches are too unreliable to use today (they are over one hundred years old) or too small (some are only 34mm in diameter) to wear out and about.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575404353/nqhfq9zlbptuyy3uf74l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>There are homage trench watches on the market, but they are either way out of my History teacher salary's budget or are just extremely poor quality and cheap looking. I created the Lufbery Trench Watch after years of searching for a wearable homage version and I can say with confidence that the Lufbery Trench Watch is unique. There are no watches on the market that pay homage to the original trench watch design as closely as the Lufbery Trench Watch that are also well made and reasonably priced. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575404565/cxflufygnkzmdu4u9ofq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Created by a History teacher</strong></h3><p> </p><p>As a History teacher I love trench watches. They were the first watches built for battle; every military watch in existence can trace its origin to the trench watch, from the classic field watches of the Vietnam War-era to the 'Dirty Dozen' from WW2. Trench watches were the first masculine watch; they were designed to be tough, solid and practical (they had to survive the battlefields of Flanders after all) and were in complete contrast to the dainty pocket watches which came before them. As well as being tough, trench watches were also design icons, with stunning art nouveau dials, hands and numerals.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575404610/lbp6ygsawk8bsvn1dzgq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Lufbery Trench Watch pays homage to the original trench watches as much as possible, in both its solid toughness and its iconic style. In order to recognise the influence that the original trench watches have had on the Lufbery Trench Watches design, on the back of every Lufbery case is an engraving of a WW1-era British Mark VII tank. These saw action in 1918, just as the trench watch was becoming ubiquitous on the front-line. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575404673/ckustoe6a1uwij69imk7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Lufbery Trench Watch versus the WW1-era trench watches</strong></h3><p> </p><h3>The case</h3><h3> </h3><p>The original trench watches were small: normally they were 36mm in diameter, however there were some as small as 34mm diameter. The Lufbery Trench Watch is designed for the twenty-first century, so it is 40mm in diameter and 48mm lug to lug. The original trench watches were solid and so is the Lufbery Trench Watch. The case is crafted from premium 316L stainless steel and is tough.

The quartz version is powered by a Seiko VD78 movement and prices start at £110. The automatic version is powered by Seiko NH15 movement (the movement has 21 jewels) and prices start at £160.

The Lufbery Trench Watch has a 1918 Mark VII tank engraved on the back. This is to commemorate the link between the Lufbery Trench Watch and the original designs from WW1.

I am a huge fan of vintage military watches and I have spent years building up a modest collection. However, the watch that I could never find to complete it was the first ever military watch and the grandfather of every military watch in existence: the trench watch. The original WW1-era trench watches are too unreliable to use today (they are over one hundred years old) or too small (some are only 34mm in diameter) to wear out and about.There are homage trench watches on the market, but they are either way out of my History teacher salary's budget or are just extremely poor quality and cheap looking. I created the Lufbery Trench Watch after years of searching for a wearable homage version and I can say with confidence that the Lufbery Trench Watch is unique. There are no watches on the market that pay homage to the original trench watch design as closely as the Lufbery Trench Watch that are also well made and reasonably priced.  Created by a History teacher As a History teacher I love trench watches. They were the first watches built for battle; every military watch in existence can trace its origin to the trench watch, from the classic field watches of the Vietnam War-era to the 'Dirty Dozen' from WW2. Trench watches were the first masculine watch; they were designed to be tough, solid and practical (they had to survive the battlefields of Flanders after all) and were in complete contrast to the dainty pocket watches which came before them. As well as being tough, trench watches were also design icons, with stunning art nouveau dials, hands and numerals.The Lufbery Trench Watch pays homage to the original trench watches as much as possible, in both its solid toughness and its iconic style. In order to recognise the influence that the original trench watches have had on the Lufbery Trench Watches design, on the back of every Lufbery case is an engraving of a WW1-era British Mark VII tank. These saw action in 1918, just as the trench watch was becoming ubiquitous on the front-line.  The Lufbery Trench Watch versus the WW1-era trench watches The case The original trench watches were small: normally they were 36mm in diameter, however there were some as small as 34mm diameter. The Lufbery Trench Watch is designed for the twenty-first century, so it is 40mm in diameter and 48mm lug to lug. The original trench watches were solid and so is the Lufbery Trench Watch. The case is crafted from premium 316L stainless steel and is tough. Each Lufbery Trench Watch comes with a two-year guarantee. The crystal The crystal on the Lufbery Trench Watch is scratch resistant sapphire glass. One issue with original trench watches is that they had mineral glass which sometimes scratched or shattered in battle conditions. The dial The dials, the numerals and the hands of the Lufbery Trench Watch are accurate when you compare them to the original trench watches. It is very rare to find a watch with the colouring of the Lufbery Dragoon now, however in WW1 they were fairly common due to the fact the contrast meant they were easier to see at night. Luminous hands and numerals The original trench watches had radium coated hands and numerals. Radium is now illegal to use due to its radioactivity, so I opted for C3 super-luminova with the Lufbery Trench Watches.  The movement The Lufbery Trench Watches are equipped with two different types of movement. The quartz version is powered by a Seiko VD78 movement and prices start at £110. The automatic version is powered by Seiko NH15 movement (the movement has 21 jewels) and prices start at £160. Original trench watches were always mechanical as they pre-dated automatic movements (invented in 1922) and quartz movements (invented by Seiko in 1969). The finishing touches The original trench watches often had maker's marks engraved onto the case. The Lufbery Trench Watch has a 1918 Mark VII tank engraved on the back. This is to commemorate the link between the Lufbery Trench Watch and the original designs from WW1. On the crown of the Lufbery Trench Watch is the Lufbery logo, which is inspired by the British Army's 'broad arrow' which was engraved on all military equipment during the First World War. SpecificationsCase size: 40mm.Case thickness: 11mm.Lug Width: 18mm.Lug to Lug: 48mm.Caseback: Engraving of a Mark VII WW1 tank (the Lufbery's official name is the Lufbery Mark VII. The Lufbery Mark VI was the range of pocket watches that were on Kickstarter in February 2017).Crown: Screw-down with an engraving of the Lufbery logo (inspired by the British military's broad arrow).Movement: Seiko NH15 (automatic) or Seiko VD78 (quartz) depending on the model.Dial: Applied 3D Indexes filled with C3 super-luminova.Crystal: Domed sapphire crystal.Water resistant: 5ATMStrap: Italian calf leather. 18mm in width.Packaging: Lufbery box.Warranty: 2 years. The Lufbery Trench Watch Collection The Lufbery Grenadier Named after the Grenadier regiments of the British Army. The design of the Lufbery Grenadier is very accurate to that of the original trench watches. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window. The Lufbery DragoonNamed after the Dragoon regiments of the British Army. The black and white dial was extremely common during WW1-era trench watches due to the fact the contrasting colours made it easier to see at night. Today the design is extremely rare; I have never seen a watch with a similar dial despite years of searching. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window.The Lufbery FusilierNamed after the Fusilier regiments of the British Army. The design of the Fusilier is also very accurate to that of the original trench watches. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window. The Lufbery HighlanderNamed after the Highland regiments of the British Army. There were no WW1-era trench watches with the black on black design, it just wouldn't be practical in a battle. I went with it though because I think it looks pretty cool. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window.The Lufbery Scots GreysNamed after the Royal Scots Greys, a now defunct cavalry regiment which my Grandfather served in during the Third Anglo-Afghan War. There were some WW1-era trench watches with a bronze case (note that the Lufbery Scots Greys has a stainless-steel case with a bronze finish), however they were fairly rare and are very valuable today. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window.The Lufbery EngineerNamed after the Engineer regiments of the British Army. Like the Lufbery Scots Greys there were some original trench watches with this design, however they were pretty rare. The Quartz version has the small second dial, the Automatic version has the date window.Reviews  Packaging All Lufbery Trench Watches come in a specially crafted box with an information booklet. Like the actual Lufbery Trench Watches, the box is excellent quality and is made to last.  About Lufbery Watches The first Lufbery Watches Kickstarter campaign was in February 2017 for a collection of pocket watches inspired by the cockpit watches of the First World War. The company is named after the WW1 aerial manoeuvre known as the Lufbery Circle and our logo is inspired by the British Army’s ‘broad arrow’ which was stamped on the back of all military equipment during WW1.

This campaign wouldn't have relaunched without your help.   About me My name is Stuart and I am a History teacher and watch enthusiast from Surrey, UK.

<p>Part of building a watch for all situations is making sure that it's not too thick. If a watch can't fit under a shirt cuff, it's not an everyday watch for lots of people! We focussed on this, and the Nanok comes in at just <strong>10.6mm thick</strong>. Despite the additional functionality of the day &amp; date movement, it's the <strong>thinnest watch we've ever made</strong>.</p>

<p>Like most high-end watches, the Nanok has a 316L <strong>stainless steel case</strong> and a <strong>sapphire crystal</strong> (which is flat with internal anti-reflective coatings) making it incredibly tough, while the <strong>screw-down crown</strong> ensures it's water resistant to <strong>100 metres/10ATM</strong>. You can swim with your watch without worrying.</p>

<p>Despite all of that toughness, Nanok weighs in at <strong>just 66g</strong> on the leather strap and 138g on the bracelet. You'll hardly notice it's there! And if it gets a bit dark, the genuine <strong>Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9</strong> lume will keep your watch visible long into the night.</p>

<p>The Nanok features a <strong>Swiss made Sellita SW 240-1</strong>. It's a well known and time-tested movement that will be easy to maintain and service for years to come.</p>
<p>The SW 240-1 is an automatic movement with a high 28,800 bpm beat rate, resulting in the <strong>super smooth </strong><strong>second hand</strong><strong> sweep </strong>that defines <strong>high-end watches</strong>.

<p>If you own a watch that you love you probably wear it a lot, so you'll know that over time it'll start to look <strong>a bit worn</strong>. No matter how careful you are with it, it's inevitable that marks and hairline scratches will start to appear.</p>
<p>What if we could do something about that? Well now we can!</p>
<p>Thanks to recent advances in the technology we can now add a scratch resistant coating to the outside of 316L stainless steel watches and so <strong>reduce the risk</strong> of marking or damaging the metal over time. Until recently this was only an option on watches at a vastly higher price.</p>
<p>If you decide to have your watch treated it will be far more resistant to scratches and marks, and so should stay new looking for far longer.</p>
<p>That's not to say we can make the watch completely scratch proof (it's not magic), but you'll find that your Nanok will be <strong>far less susceptible to the signs of wear</strong> that are associated with standard, untreated watches.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>We apply a tiny coating to the outside of the watch (and bracelet if you order one). At about 3.0 microns thick, it's basically invisible. You'll notice a very slight change in the colour of the metal when compared directly with an uncoated watch, but that's it. Once the coating is added, the hardness rating of the outside of the watch goes up from about 225HV (the hardness rating of standard 316L stainless steel) to 900-1100HV.</p>
<p>What does that actually mean? Well Corning® Gorilla® Glass 6 (the latest version of the stuff most smartphones use) has a rating of around 680HV, while sapphire crystal has a rating of somewhere over 2000HV. So the coating on your watch case will be somewhere between the two, and <strong>many times harder than standard 316L stainless steel</strong>.</p>
<h3>What does the hardening cost?</h3>
<p>The hardening process costs an extra <strong>£40</strong> on top of the price of your watch. When you order your Nanok just add an extra £40 to your pledge, we'll be in touch at the end of the campaign to confirm your choice.</p>
<h3>Why an option rather than a default?</h3>
<p>The coating process costs more and it takes a bit more time. We don't want to raise the price and increase the lead time for people that aren't interested in the additional long-term protection. It'll take around a month longer to deliver your Nanok if you go for this option, but the result will be a watch tougher than any made from standard 316L steel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542212817/apipmkztdurjjob71xsu.png"" src=""""/></p>

You'll notice a very slight change in the colour of the metal when compared directly with an uncoated watch, but that's it. Once the coating is added, the hardness rating of the outside of the watch goes up from about 225HV (the hardness rating of standard 316L stainless steel) to 900-1100HV.
What does that actually mean? Well Corning® Gorilla® Glass 6 (the latest version of the stuff most smartphones use) has a rating of around 680HV, while sapphire crystal has a rating of somewhere over 2000HV. So the coating on your watch case will be somewhere between the two, and many times harder than standard 316L stainless steel.
What does the hardening cost?
The hardening process costs an extra £40 on top of the price of your watch. When you order your Nanok just add an extra £40 to your pledge, we'll be in touch at the end of the campaign to confirm your choice.
Why an option rather than a default?
The coating process costs more and it takes a bit more time. We don't want to raise the price and increase the lead time for people that aren't interested in the additional long-term protection. It'll take around a month longer to deliver your Nanok if you go for this option, but the result will be a watch tougher than any made from standard 316L steel.


We're offering three strap options for the Nanok so that you can make it work for you from day one. We'll also be making further options available via our store in the future so that Nanok continues to adapt to your style. Or, of course, you can pick up a strap from your retailer of choice, there is nothing proprietary about our straps. 

1) Pick one from our choice of two genuine leather straps, included in the base price. Available in grey or black and handmade from vegetable tanned leather, these straps are the best we've found at any price point. Comfortable, soft and light, the leather strap can dress up or down easily depending on your day.

2) A 316L stainless steel H-link bracelet with ratcheting clasp, available for an extra £30. H-link bracelets hold their shape really well, resulting in a solid, high-quality feel. Ratcheting clasps help ensure that whatever the size of your wrist, you can adjust the bracelet perfectly. The bracelet features all solid links, of course, and tapers from 20mm at the lugs to 18mm at the clasp.

If you'd like both a leather strap and the bracelet that's fine, just add £35 to your pledge.",21.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h1>The Mommy Brobe Story</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Allison Schickel. The inspiration for the Mommy Brobe came to me in 2002 after having my first daughter Mackenzie. I was lucky enough to have enough milk to nurse my newborn however the new overwhelming size of my chest was not all that well, comfortable. I was very self conscious about people coming in and out of the hospital room to visit the new baby while I was wearing those oh so attractive gowns. Not much changed after we took the baby home. It was a struggle everyday to find anything that was soft, flattering, supportive and made me feel beautiful. Women want to feel attractive not only for their partner but for themselves as well. I was tired of spending a crazy amount of money on nursing garments that were cheaply made, not stylish and quite frankly not very supportive of the new milk maids. I wanted a nursing garment that I could continue to wear while loosing my baby weight and even long after I stopped nursing.</p>
<p>I started searching for a comfortable robe with a front-opening bra inside to give me maximum coverage and support during my maternity. Nothing online or in stores matched my idea of a fashionably luxurious maternity garment. This launched my mission to give moms the ultimate robe.</p>
<p>Please help me in my mission to make the journey into mommy-hood more enjoyable. What I can promise you is a product that was created by a woman for women, designed with personal touch and great service before and after receiving your Mommy Brobe. If good fortune shines our way during this crowdfunding campaign, I will most certainly bring you many more wonderful garments designed for lounging, workouts, swimwear and most importantly (support THE GIRLS) fashion that supports women. Please share the Mommy Brobe with your friends and family. Thanks so much for your support!</p>

<h2>ChargerGenie® evolved from Real Life Experience of Founder/Inventor Jeannie (aka ""Genie"")</h2>
<p>As a working technology executive with plenty of gadgets, Jeannie spent her fair share of time in hotel rooms and on the road where she realized that finding a place to charge and losing chargers were a big problem.  Even in modern hotel rooms, the outlets were never ample enough - especially for family vacations. Tired of tripping over power-cords, crawling behind nightstands and charging her phone in the bathroom she began to carry her electronics in a plastic bag and kept a power-strip in her luggage. The plastic bag was soon replaced with a more durable canvas tote and she wondered<em> ""Why the two had never been joined before?.""</em> After much searching, she couldn't believe it had never been done --and ChargerGenie® was born!  Meet Jeannie (aka ""Genie"") in the video! </p>

<h2> FAQ</h2>
<h3>Question:  I know sometimes on crowd funding sites the product never gets made.  Will I definitely receive my ChargerGenie®?</h3>
<p>Yes! ChargerGenie® is already being manufactured and soon shipping to the USA to our E-Commerce fulfillment partner, Fulfillrite in Lakewood, New Jersey. TakeCharger LLC has invested its own money to make the product before launching on Indiegogo so ChargerGenie® has been de-risked to ensure every ChargerGenie® order would be fulfilled.</p>
<h3>Question:  Why is ChargerGenie® plugged into a wall and not a battery pack?</h3>
<p>Answer: They do different things. ChargerGenie® stores and charges all types of devices so you would keep your portable battery charger in your ChargerGenie® when it's not in use.  While portable battery charges are useful and improving, they have capacity limits and the more powerful ones are expensive ranging in prices from $40 for a simple phone top-off device up to $200 for one that will add 5 hours to a tablet.  The portable battery has to then be charged itself.  ChargerGenie® delivers a powerful 1875 watts and can fully charge and power 8 devices at once including a laptop.  ChargerGenie® is light weight and at $49.99 MSRP delivers great value.  When on the road, you can carry your portable battery with you and when you return to your hotel or home - charge and store it in your ChargerGenie®.</p>
<h3>Question:  Can I order this product outside of North America?</h3>
<p>Answer:  ChargerGenie® has UL approval in USA and Canada.  We are not currently shipping outside of North America. </p>

<p>Hello
friends/prospective investors,</p>
<p>We all know the
saying “give a man a fish and you will feed him for a day, but teach a man to
fish and you will feed him for a lifetime”. Since its inception over 4 years
ago, the vision of iheartgo has been to become a sustainable organization that
will help communities flourish, with a goal of having 100% of our public
donations going towards the projects for which they are intended. For the past
few years we have grown thanks to the generous support of our financial
partners, but, as you know, even after having a huge meal one day, you will still
be hungry again the next day. With an expanding vision and more responsibility,
we think it’s time we learned how to fish.</p>
<p>Today, we would
like to introduce you to the “social good” brand #he<b>commanded</b>us, the brand that’s spreading the Great Commission
message and doing good. With the recent establishment of <a href=""http://iheartgo.org/education"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iheartgo’s technology institute</a> in Uganda, the organization has a need for an increase in revenue now
more than ever. In order to steer clear of the donor-dependent model for
income, we decided to put our skills in branding, production, and development to
good use by launching a brand of products whose proceeds will go towards
sustaining iheartgo’s operations and its expanding international work.</p>
<h3><b>About the brand</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>We love people; that’s
why we work in both secular and Christian realms to advance our vision for
community development. However, it only makes sense that our brand is taking
Jesus’s direct commands and putting them on clothing and other products. The
aim of the brand is not to sell the message, but to promote the social good being done by our organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Plan</b></h3>
<p>We will launch in early/mid-summer
2014, pending the raising of the funds below.</p>
<p><b>Here’s how we are proceeding:</b><br/></p><p>We are seeking to
raise initial capital of $4,500 to get 400 fully customized t-shirts of 1
design in different sizes and colors ready for market. To start, we will only process
orders within the U.S. We will hire 1 part-time, commission-based employee who
will handle all the shipments, while the customer service is handled via Internet
by our full-time U.S. staff currently working in Uganda. The gross income from
the first run will be invested back into printing a second design, thus
kick-starting the process over again. After the initial cycles are complete and
we’ve attained stability, 50% of the profits from all products henceforth will be
contributed towards the sustainability of iheartgo and its international
humanitarian work.</p>
<p></p><h3><b>About the shirts</b></h3>

My name is Ashant'e Clayborne Roberson and I am a wife, mother, author, Special Education teacher, and most of all, A CHILD OF GOD! Like most people in their lives, I had moments of uncertainty in regards to what I was suppose to be doing with my life. I felt a void and I tried to fill that void by working a lot, going back to school, engaging in toxic relationships, and even partying but nothing could fill that void. I would often watch people doing great things and thought that one day that could be me, but I did not know what I was suppose to be doing. One day I finally asked my Creator, what do you want me to do with the life you gave me? And he gave me two things that I am suppose to be doing. The first was to write a book called Tidbits for Women and the second is to start a Christian tee shirt line called From Him Through Me Tees. By doing these two things, I will be able to minister to others and build the Kingdom of God, which is my sole purpose in life! Do you know how good it feels to know what your purpose is in life? There are so many people in the world that do not know their purpose and the are lost.

<p>In 2017, three friends united under one crazy passion: <strong>mismatched sneakers</strong>. <strong>Simon</strong> and <strong>Achille</strong> met while studying at Paris’s top business school, HEC. Their friendship formed when they noticed each other doing the same unusual thing: <strong>wearing mismatched shoes</strong>. Knowing that an ordinary office job wasn't for them - Simon and Achilles decided to walk their own path and follow their <strong>passion</strong> for <strong>unique sneakers</strong>. Together with <strong>Benoît</strong>, the artistic designer, they created a team. Over the course of one night, the team turned their dreams into reality and created their first pair of sneakers. And just like that, <strong>CAVAL was born</strong>! </p>

<p>We are very concerned about the <strong>social</strong> and <strong>environmental</strong> <strong>impact</strong> of our sneakers.

<p><strong>Making sure our workers are being treated fairly is a top priority for us</strong>. All of our workers in France, Portugal, and Italy are paid living wages and work in the best conditions.

</div></div>","We are thrilled to introduce CAVAL, The world’s first mismatched sneakers. We have two feet. Why wear two identical shoes?
CAVAL sneakers are unlike any other on the market. Our original and fun sneakers are designed to make you stand out from the crowd.
Designed in Paris and handcrafted in Portugal, our sneakers are comfortable, chic, and high quality. Crafted out of the finest Italian leather, CAVAL sneakers are built to carry you through the journey of life.
Get FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING when you order 2 or more pairs!
READY TO JOIN THE MISMATCHED REVOLUTION ?
 

 


We dared ourselves to be different…
At CAVAL, we believe that your style should be as original as you.
We want to see a brighter world, where people are free to express themselves fully and have fun while doing it. Our unisex sneakers are perfect for those who dare to stand out.
CAVALs were designed to be noticed while fitting in perfectly in your wardrobe. They can be dressed up and down. Wear them from the office, to happy hour, to wherever else life takes you. Life is a beautifully mismatched journey and our sneakers reflect just that!

 
CAVAL sneakers are designed in Paris, created in Portugal, made with Europe’s best materials. Mismatched, unique, and durable, CAVALs are unlike any shoes in your closet. 


In 2017, three friends united under one crazy passion: mismatched sneakers. Simon and Achille met while studying at Paris’s top business school, HEC. Their friendship formed when they noticed each other doing the same unusual thing: wearing mismatched shoes. Knowing that an ordinary office job wasn't for them - Simon and Achilles decided to walk their own path and follow their passion for unique sneakers. Together with Benoît, the artistic designer, they created a team. Over the course of one night, the team turned their dreams into reality and created their first pair of sneakers. And just like that, CAVAL was born! 




 

 


We are very concerned about the social and environmental impact of our sneakers. That’s why we have decided to entirely produce our sneakers in Europe. We personally visit all of our subcontractors to ensure our sneakers are being made responsibly and ethically. 

Making sure our workers are being treated fairly is a top priority for us. All of our workers in France, Portugal, and Italy are paid living wages and work in the best conditions. Furthermore, all the materials we use to craft our products strictly respect all of the European Union environmental laws and regulations. 



 

 

 

CAVAL sneakers are all about details: there are always 7 differences between both feet! Will you find them all ?

<h3>Our Design</h3>
<p>Every detail of the ANTIKYTHER FLYREB project started with a series of hand-drawn sketches. We found the solution to define the rule for divers. We focused on simplifying all the complexity of the product, giving a clean and modern look that is now the core of the ANTIKYTHERA brand. After getting feedback on our concepts from a number of designers and business associates (people we knew would be interested in our product), our designs went through various revisions and were optimized so that they could be converted into CAD drawings.  </p>

FLYREB by Antikythera The watch conceived as an instrument for adventures... the most complete of all analog watches.  
check it out...

 

Our Design
Every detail of the ANTIKYTHER FLYREB project started with a series of hand-drawn sketches. We found the solution to define the rule for divers. We focused on simplifying all the complexity of the product, giving a clean and modern look that is now the core of the ANTIKYTHERA brand. After getting feedback on our concepts from a number of designers and business associates (people we knew would be interested in our product), our designs went through various revisions and were optimized so that they could be converted into CAD drawings.  

3D technical drawings and Antikythera's draft
SCUBADIVER RULE CALCULATOR 
 


 
Example just fo Tech scuba divers, how to calculate the pressure at the limit of O2Pp 1.4 using a Nitrox 32 (NI)

 
 I° - Collate number 10 on the outer ring with the percentage of mixture you want to calculate in this case 32 as 32% of gas mix  
II° - In the outer ring, in front at the number 14 (1.4 OTU) in the inner ring, you can see the maximum pressure not to exceed 44 ( exactly is 4,375 BAR = 33,75 mt)
TRAVELLERS: Exchange Rates Calculator

 I° - Collimate the number you consider ""foreign currency exchange"" (example in YEN) that is on the outer ring with the ""10"" number of the inner ring. In this case 1 US$ = 133 JP YEN (example)  
II° - Do you want to know the equivalent of 300, 3000 YEN? Look for the ""30"" outer ring and the value is exactly collimated with the number in the inner ring. In this case 300 YEN = 2.25 US$ (3000 YEN = 22.50 US$).
 
The Making of ANTIKYTHERA  
We have chosen a manufacturing company based in northern Italy, the choice has been made based on its experience. It has been a legendary company in the design and realization of watches for over 50 years, with great professionalism and reliability. Another very important detail to ensure a complete cycle of the project is that the company is equipped to handle large production lines. Another not uncommon fact is that the company headquarters are just 25 kilometers from our studio so this proximity was important because it allowed us to oversee the production of the Antikythera watch product line.


 The history and the tradition combined with its constant technical updating, ensured high quality standards, able to meet the needs of the great names in the watchmaking industry, whose names must be treated with confidentiality, in observance to the current privacy policies. In addition to manufacturing department for third parties, Is the producer and the worldwide licensee of MOMODESIGN and MONDIA brands, with its own Italian and international distribution networks.

<h3>It Is I, Lucian - Artist and Known Rune Pervert</h3>
<p>I love pins.  Whomst among us doth not?  We're all gays, it's 2019, and we're down to frankly bedazzle the crap out of every apparel flap we can lift up and pierce.  I've made badges since I was a child, and was very excited to get my adult hands on one of those big butch <i>kerchung</i> steel presses to make 1"" button badges for conventions.  I made a superb set (if I do say so myself) of runic badges finished with transparent iridescent film - combining my love of bindrunes and iridescence in one nice little magic toolkit. </p>
<p>It is now several years later, and my favourite Pin Guys, <a href=""https://www.pinpalsltd.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PinPals Ltd</a>, will now happily do ""rainbow anodisation"" on their pins.  What does this mean?  This means, my friend, that I can now actualise my rune magic badges in enamel pin format.  All the clunky pointy gorgeousness of pins, but without having to abandon the luscious magical iridescence.  Excited?  I am.  Read on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sorry, I Just Got Here.  What's a Bind Rune?</h3>
<p>So runes, right? You know what a rune is?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I Guess So - They're Viking Letters, Right?</h3>
<p>In a manner of speaking, yes, that's right.  Runic writing systems were the normal way of writing Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet, dating from around 150CE and generally dying out around 700CE (central Europe) and 1100CE (northern Europe) as the cultures that used them were Christianised.  Some places persisted in using runic scripts right into the 20th century, but those are rare.  Where our alphabet is called the ""alphabet"" after the Greek names for the letters in order (alpha beta gamma, etc.... so ""alphabet""), runic writing systems are typically called a futharc/futhark, after the first six letters in order (F, U, Th, A, R and C).  These are runes.  Runes! That's they.</p>
<p>Unlike the Latin alphabet, though, each letter has a word associated with it, and therein a concept.  Isaz (the letter I) means ice, and Raido (the letter R) means a journey, for instance.  This lends the runes themselves to be used in symbolic ways, and as a means to smash a lot of concepts together in visually harmonious and potent ways.  The Vikings used to do this to emblazen various intents and purposes on their possessions.  Boats had runes conjoined to encourage them not to sink on their voyages, mugs were stamped with runes to keep the drinker safe from poison - that sort of thing.  These harmonious glyphs are called <strong>bindrunes</strong>, because they are several runes bound together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Is Clear And I Am Enlightened. Now, Please Tell Me Of Your Bindrunes</h3>
<p>So here are the gorgeous bindrunes I have created, and their explanations.  There was a much shorter form of this on the packaging of the original badges I made. </p>

<p>Mannaz, the rune for mankind, interpersonal relationships, means isaz, the frozen lake, and ansuz, the voice of god, or an appeal to the gods for input.  <strong>A crystallised moment of interpersonal harmony, frozen in time and sanctified.</strong></p>

<p>The unknowable liminality of laguz, the lake, meets hagalaz, a hailstorm, the all-consuming power of nature and the weather, with just a pinch of nauthiz's bloody desire and need.  <strong>Have fun out there.</strong></p>
<p>Each pin is <strong>10mm x 29mm</strong> - absolutely tiny and very thin!  Enamel is cut out where there's negative space, giving them an airy, ephemeral feel.  I designed them this way to work together as a group, each sitting harmoniously alongside its siblings.  <strong>My mockups are already done and accepted, and they're up in the gallery above this panel. </strong> I have no example of the beautiful reality of rainbow anodised enamel, but Google images will tell you with images I'm not allowed to purloin.  Suffice to say, it's <i>exquisite</i>.  Each pin will be backstamped with @misterlucian, so you can remember where you got them.  I have not yet decided how to package them.  Probably all five on one card, plus individual backing cards for each ""loose rune""?  Sounds all right, I'll do that.</p>
<p>I've worked with PinPals Ltd. many times before, and they're reliable, and of exceptional quality.  <strong>The turnaround from order is about a month, so as this campaign trundles on until the end of August, I imagine the pins will get in around October.</strong>  They'll be ready for <strong>Thought Bubble</strong> and <strong>MCM London</strong>!</p>
<p>The funds in the first instance are for <strong>100 of each design, which I intend to parcel up into 50 sets of all five, plus 50 ""loose runes""</strong> for individual sale.  This will be<strong> £1070</strong> in total, so I've popped a bit on top of that for administrative costs, post and packaging, all that.  You get it.  Any excess will just make more pins.  More, and more runes.  Tonnes of runes.  Tunes of runes.  Tonnes of Ronnes. uh</p>

<p>Chammock Original is inspired by the natives of Philippines who knit the bamboo into a chair. Thanks to modern waxing technology, the fiber can be super light and strong. We can transform the traditional hammock chair into the most compact and easy to stow ever - <b>Chammock Original</b>.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The “Chammock Original” is a hammock chair with small pack size, and weight less than a can of coke. It is made from the highest quality nylon and lightweight aluminum carabiners for optimal safety. It is very easy to assemble, and only required small room to set up. Hung from trees, posts, boat masts and whatever you can find that is stable and range of  4 feet (120cm) or wider.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719045/vt2xdclvclu5xfgmhxar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>On “Chammock Original”, there are two pocket bags, one is on the top to stuff jacket inside as a pillow for better comfort, and the other one is on the bottom for storing the “Chammock Original” as well as storage when you sit on it. You can also stretch your arm and chat with your friends through the two holes beside.It also included one adjustment strap to adjust width between two carabiners for optimizing your comfort curve.Use it to remember your last comfort curve and replicate it..</p>
<p>As serious hikers, we also love hammock. However, it is not very comfortable to sit on one. When we sit on the hammock as chair, the edge of the hammock will actually press on our thigh since it is very tight when sitting on. On the other hand, it is also not going to give a good upright support.You are not going to enjoy it if having back issue.</p>
<p>That is why we design Chammock. It has an asymmetric cut, where the upper side is for supporting your back and the bottom side is for supporting your butt parts. You are going to feel like sitting on a real chair and it is also easier to get out of.</p>

<p>We love outdoor activities- a lot. </p>
<p>This idea came from one of our trips fr<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">om Patagonia to Yellow stone Nation Park. We have hammocks with us, but very little chance to use it. While hiking or camping, the hammock is not very easy to set up in the wild. It needs two solid items in between 10-15 feet (300-360 cm). On the other hand, the hammock is designed for laying not for seating, you will find difficulty to sit on it to read or have a decent meal. When you sit on the hammock, your back can’t count on it. So you can only sit for a very short period of time. That is why we come up with the idea –</span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Chammock Original</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p>Since we understand the size and weight really matter for those hiker and climber, we try to minimize the size and weight as much as we can. After dozen of prototypes we had tried , the final design offers not only easy assembly but also with its construction based on durable, high-quality materials.</p>
<div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719050/uniwga5dltu1iqqgkjui.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Since it is really lightweight and compact, it can be easily set up anywhere. We usually use it during the hiking trips when you don’t really want to sit on cold stone or snow. It is also suited for reading and eating during the casual use at nearby park or even just in your own yard.</p>

Red dot official website:
http://bit.ly/1MCZ4s3

Winner of Red Dot Design Award 2015









                                                                          Easy Set Up

       Chammock's ingenious design provides a supportive upright seating position

                                                     Weight lighter than a can of coke

                                       Packed size smaller than mini iPad or A5 book

The most Compact and easy to stow hammock chair
Ingenious design provides a supportive upright seating position
Needed only 4 feet (120cm ) width to set up hammock chair
Quick and easy set-up 
Weight is less than a can of coke.
Packed size smaller than mini ipad
The sides of the chair are open so you’re not get that “cocooned” feeling while sitting, and you can hang your arms out. 


Chammock Original is inspired by the natives of Philippines who knit the bamboo into a chair. Thanks to modern waxing technology, the fiber can be super light and strong. We can transform the traditional hammock chair into the most compact and easy to stow ever - Chammock Original.

                          Chammock can be carried either on a belt or in a backpack
The “Chammock Original” is a hammock chair with small pack size, and weight less than a can of coke. It is made from the highest quality nylon and lightweight aluminum carabiners for optimal safety. It is very easy to assemble, and only required small room to set up. Hung from trees, posts, boat masts and whatever you can find that is stable and range of  4 feet (120cm) or wider.


On “Chammock Original”, there are two pocket bags, one is on the top to stuff jacket inside as a pillow for better comfort, and the other one is on the bottom for storing the “Chammock Original” as well as storage when you sit on it. You can also stretch your arm and chat with your friends through the two holes beside.It also included one adjustment strap to adjust width between two carabiners for optimizing your comfort curve.Use it to remember your last comfort curve and replicate it..
As serious hikers, we also love hammock. However, it is not very comfortable to sit on one. When we sit on the hammock as chair, the edge of the hammock will actually press on our thigh since it is very tight when sitting on. On the other hand, it is also not going to give a good upright support.You are not going to enjoy it if having back issue.
That is why we design Chammock. It has an asymmetric cut, where the upper side is for supporting your back and the bottom side is for supporting your butt parts. You are going to feel like sitting on a real chair and it is also easier to get out of.

                                                         Chammock  vs. Hammock

                                                            Chammock vs. Hammock

                                                                    Easy to get out of
The ”Chammock Original” is lightweight , comfortable and easy to set up, therefore making it highly suitable for backpackers, hikers, campers or just occasional naps.

                                    Chammock is perfect for both adults and children





We love outdoor activities- a lot. 
This idea came from one of our trips from Patagonia to Yellow stone Nation Park. We have hammocks with us, but very little chance to use it. While hiking or camping, the hammock is not very easy to set up in the wild. It needs two solid items in between 10-15 feet (300-360 cm). On the other hand, the hammock is designed for laying not for seating, you will find difficulty to sit on it to read or have a decent meal. When you sit on the hammock, your back can’t count on it. So you can only sit for a very short period of time. That is why we come up with the idea –Chammock Original.
Since we understand the size and weight really matter for those hiker and climber, we try to minimize the size and weight as much as we can. After dozen of prototypes we had tried , the final design offers not only easy assembly but also with its construction based on durable, high-quality materials.


Since it is really lightweight and compact, it can be easily set up anywhere. We usually use it during the hiking trips when you don’t really want to sit on cold stone or snow. It is also suited for reading and eating during the casual use at nearby park or even just in your own yard.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i>With your help,</i> we aim to open a brick-and-mortar</strong> <strong>sewing studio</strong> <strong>in downtown Bloomington, Indiana.</strong> We believe expanding into a commercial space will allow us to provide services for a larger part of the community, and to create well-paying jobs for local seamstresses/tailors.</p>
<p><strong>My name is Liby Ball,</strong> current owner and head designer at <a href=""http://facebook.com/libyball"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Liby Ball Sewing &amp; Design</a>. I am a self-taught seamstress from Boise, Idaho with over 10 years of professional sewing experience as a certified Bridal Alterations Specialist.</p>
<p><strong>A few years ago,</strong> I was working as the Alterations Department Manager of a major bridal retailer. I discovered that the options were <i>very limited</i>, not only in size and style, but <i>I </i>was limited in the work <i>I was allowed to do</i>. <strong>I got so tired of saying “no” to my clients!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyone deserves to dress the way they want to, especially on their wedding day!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Start-up funding will essentially allow me to achieve my dream: Opening a sewing studio (outside of my home) with a focus on <i>body-positivity.</i></strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
With your help, we aim to open a brick-and-mortar sewing studio in downtown Bloomington, Indiana. We believe expanding into a commercial space will allow us to provide services for a larger part of the community, and to create well-paying jobs for local seamstresses/tailors.
My name is Liby Ball, current owner and head designer at Liby Ball Sewing & Design. I am a self-taught seamstress from Boise, Idaho with over 10 years of professional sewing experience as a certified Bridal Alterations Specialist.
A few years ago, I was working as the Alterations Department Manager of a major bridal retailer. I discovered that the options were very limited, not only in size and style, but I was limited in the work I was allowed to do. I got so tired of saying “no” to my clients!
Everyone deserves to dress the way they want to, especially on their wedding day!
Start-up funding will essentially allow me to achieve my dream: Opening a sewing studio (outside of my home) with a focus on body-positivity.

For those of you that are new to our project please have a look at the <span>4 INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE MADE THE SMART BELT A HOUSEHOLD NAME ON KICKSTARTER:</span> </p><p> </p><div data-id=""29816853""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598807692/pbdliikoo3roogcxmitw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>  Firstly, replacing the 5 hole system with 32 adjustments brings a world of comfort and a whole new dimension of adjustability. Not many people think about it or realize it but, our waist changes as we go about our business throughout the day. A classic belt does not adjust correctly because holes are too far apart.</p><p>Forget feeling tight or loose, you'll forget you have a belt on but your pants will stay exactly where they're supposed to. </p><p> </p><div data-id=""29816950""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598807732/ax3o9wmulgnf9hmrqpgb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>Our Kevlar® Core built with Kevlar® fibres is our staple innovation. Belts wear out because the leather flexes longitudinally and loses structure. Our Kevlar® Core prevents that from happening by reinforcing the whole structure like nothing else. It makes the whole thing highly durable yet light and comfortable.  We are the only licensee authorized by DuPont to make belts using the Kevlar® brand.</p><p>DuPont™ and Kevlar® are trademarks or registered trademarks of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company used under license by Harmattan Design LLC  (Project Creators).</p><p> </p><div data-id=""29816968""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598807761/lprcmvfy3bdxvhkuwtpm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>T  he Leather we use is the most exclusive leather anywhere in the world. Vegetable Tanning is almost a lost art. Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the handful of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number. <span>THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE</span> is the first belt we make out of leather that is dyed structurally, inside, as opposed to painting the top layer. By doing this, we made sure that scratches can be reabsorbed inside the leather itself, a kind of self healing.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""29816988""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598807915/uyx493ciddlvw3ufmigk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Good customer service.</span></p><p><span>The belts and buckles are very nice and of good quality. After using the release trigger a couple of times, it is very easy to use. The video guide on <a href=""https://www.harmattandesign.com/smartbeltguide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.harmattandesign.com/smartbeltguide</a> is very helpful.</span></p><p><span>I will definitely buy a Smart Belt 4.0, if the creators ever decides for another version bump.

And I love the new minimal buckle, it's much more comfortable while sitting. Thanks! ”</span></p><p><span>”Guys</span></p><p><span>This belt is amazing! Truly! No more holes that get destroyed by normal use, making it so easy to change between trousers ! And the micro adjustment from the ratchet system is genius.</span></p><p><span>My suggestions for mk4 are the following:-</span></p><p><span>A wider belt and buckle for jeans.</span></p><p><span>A complete woman’s range with colours and buckles tailored to the female of the species. My wife thinks this belt is brilliant but a bit manly (obviously lol)</span></p><p><span>Thank you again! It’s the last belt I’ll buy, except another from you when you do this again lol”</span></p><p><span>”Arrived in Melbourne, Australia. Looks great, easy to use once I realised that loosening works by first pulling to tighten and while doing that pushing the button is effortless since holding to tighten it releases the pressure on the button from the ratchet mechanism. ”</span></p><p><span>”the smart belt was fantastic good! very convenient. is there any chance i could buy another one? or u guys making 4.0 soon? ”</span></p><p><span>”Hi I received my belt and it's perfect ! How can I purchase another one ? ”</span></p><p><span>”Best belt ever so far. Have 4 of them plus some more as gift. Can’t wait for more colors such as burgundy. Make sure the color stays on. Thanks and happy new year to your team. ”</span></p><p><span>”I have both SMART BELT 2.0 and 3.0 , love them much, looking forward your SMART BELT ""4.0"" !!

I would love to buy a different belt buckle design to change things up from time to time. How would I be able to purchase a different belt buckle separately? ”</span></p><p><span>”Received the 3 belts I ordered. All perfect. My husband and sons love them! ”</span></p><p><span>”Received my belts and buckles yesterday. Fantastic product. Would like to see more buckle designs in future. 4.0? How about a titanium buckle? Would solve the allergy issue perhaps. ”</span></p><p><span>”Thanks for sorting out the issue with my order - the buckle was missing from my package but after mentioning that on here you corrected the issue and got the buckle a few days a go.

With a track record spanning 5 years and 7 Campaigns with over 50 000 backers in crowdfunding overall, it's safe to say we have done this before.   This year, as before, we have improved  upon our innovative belt to make it even better. We've done it with your help and feedback and are grateful, sincerely and extremely grateful to the Kickstarter Community  for providing us with a home and a place of learning. 
 THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE 2020 -  This year, upon backer requests we have brought back all the colors from previous iterations and added 2 more for a total of 10.On the technical side of things, the Smart Belt Ultimate is the pinnacle of what we can do, the leather is now dyed in depth, something completely new to our process and the buckles have received a (rarely seen in buckle manufacturing) third layer of protective coating. For those of you that are new to our project please have a look at the 4 INNOVATIONS THAT HAVE MADE THE SMART BELT A HOUSEHOLD NAME ON KICKSTARTER:  
   Firstly, replacing the 5 hole system with 32 adjustments brings a world of comfort and a whole new dimension of adjustability. Not many people think about it or realize it but, our waist changes as we go about our business throughout the day. A classic belt does not adjust correctly because holes are too far apart.Forget feeling tight or loose, you'll forget you have a belt on but your pants will stay exactly where they're supposed to.  
 Our Kevlar® Core built with Kevlar® fibres is our staple innovation. Belts wear out because the leather flexes longitudinally and loses structure. Our Kevlar® Core prevents that from happening by reinforcing the whole structure like nothing else. It makes the whole thing highly durable yet light and comfortable.  We are the only licensee authorized by DuPont to make belts using the Kevlar® brand.DuPont™ and Kevlar® are trademarks or registered trademarks of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company used under license by Harmattan Design LLC  (Project Creators). 
 T  he Leather we use is the most exclusive leather anywhere in the world. Vegetable Tanning is almost a lost art. Because it takes longer to tan the leather with natural tannins it has been replaced by chromium tanning at the turn of the century. We get our leather from a small valley in Tuscany, Italy, one of the handful of places in the world where this is still done. It's much more resilient that normal leather, it's all natural, eco friendly and really smells good too. It will come with a certificate of authenticity and a serial number. THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE is the first belt we make out of leather that is dyed structurally, inside, as opposed to painting the top layer. By doing this, we made sure that scratches can be reabsorbed inside the leather itself, a kind of self healing. 
  Have you ever had a problem with a wrong size or buying a present for someone, ever been in between sizes? Not our Smart Belt Ultimate. You will get to make your own size, so no chance of getting it wrong. Please remember that our belt will cover a max. waist size of 115 cm / 45"". FOR THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE iteration, the buckle has received a third protective layer a lacquer that will make the buckle even harder to scratch. 60 COLOR / STRAP / BUCKLE COMBINATIONS THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE  is the most diverse we have ever made. The leather will have all the variations of previous years plus some new ones.  10 STRAP OPTIONS: You can choose any of the 10 colors at the end of the campaign and we will send you an email with a link to the order survey.DYED THROUGH LEATHER FOR ALL STRAPS - ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SCRATCH!
 For the first time, THE SMART BELT uses leather that is dyed by soaking and tumbling so that the color gets inside the structure of the leather, IMPOSSIBLE ALMOST TO SCRATCH.   Our well known line of track and ratchet buckles, 6 options.WE HAVE ADDED A THIRD LAYER LACQUER!Now even harder to scratch and wear out!  ALL 60 OPTIONS HERE 
 This year 2020, for THE SMART BELT ULTIMATE, we will ship pledges out to backers every week starting the middle of OCTOBER! SHIPPING MIDDLE OF OCTOBER!   SATISFACTION SURVEY We send out a satisfaction survey each year, to our knowledge we are the only Kickstarter Project to do so. We do it because we want to know if where doing right by our backers or not. Our result speak for themselves,  the numbers from The Smart Belt 2.0 and 1.0 show that more than 95% of our backers very happy with their pledge and said that our belt is better than any they have had before.

You guys did an awesome job, how can I buy another one. Thank you”“These belts are amazing and well worth every cent. Plus the customer service was extremely helpful and responsive... A great product and a great company. It's very much appreciated and not all campaigns are so well run.”“Hi there. Just wanted to thank the team commitment, effort and fast response on queries. Of course I am pretty amazed with the quality of the Smart Belt 3.0 and I just started to wear it. I hope I will enjoy it for many years. Thanks bye!”“best belts ever , my son daughter and wife really like these belts , as do I the only belts I have that fit comfortably all the others never get the right fit , either to tight or a touch loose , these belts are perfect . I use them daily for over 1 year and they still look new ! Leather is great no cracks or ageing”“Love it!I did a video in Spanish to share in Mexico, hope you like it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDhNqxjN6Uc ”“Loved my two belts, look good and work perfectly. Love the product!”“@creator - I was your 1.0 and 3.0 backers and I hand three belts in total - enjoy every one of them!And I have no problem receiving it in Hong Kong.I really wanna know your next adventure - newer colour (eg white) or leather with pattern more suitable for jeans and sneakers - weekend adventure.”“Belt is amazing I received long time ago. My father also use it and I will buy more””I love my Smart Belts 3.0! They have to be the best belts I've ever bought. I'm glad that I stumbled across this project, and that I wasn't afraid to support it. I've been screwed before, and most of us know that Kickstarter just washes their hands of any responsibility for the scam projects.Anyway, great job, guys (and girls?)! ””I've recieved my belts and couldn't be more pleased! Worth the wait, the belts are all that I expected and more””Just want to say that I love my belt, and am disappointed I didn't order a couple more.I'll be back for the next campaign. ””I absolutely love these belts. Thank you for all your work.SUGGESTION: PLEASE research making a dress belt in traditional Shell Cordovan #8 color. I believe many of your backers would be on board, and I'll be the first! Tom Bickta””Using my belt for about 2 months and it already is my favorite belt :D Keep up the great work! ””I got my 3 belts a couple of days ago. One belt strap was delivered in the wrong color, but the creators responded fast and will send a replacement with the next shipping wave. Good customer service.The belts and buckles are very nice and of good quality. After using the release trigger a couple of times, it is very easy to use. The video guide on https://www.harmattandesign.com/smartbeltguide is very helpful.I will definitely buy a Smart Belt 4.0, if the creators ever decides for another version bump. Hopefully the team will not lose their motivation after some negative comments from impatient backers here on the site.Good work, thanks! ””Actually, can’t wait for 4.0 - so I just ordered two more Smart Belts on Indiegogo :) ””Well. I am now the proud owner of smart belts 2.0 and 3.0 and i still think they are awesome! Thanks a lot guys! ””Hello there, I just wanted to say, that I'm very happy with my belt!Keep making such great items. ””Bonjour, j’ai reçu ma ceinture hier, bien arrivée en France ! Thank you ! Belle ceinture ! ””Just got both belts in UK. Fantastic quality, especially the buckles! Looking forward to retiring my battered current belts for this upgrade :) ””Thank you, I just received my two belt, looks amazing ! I'm happy ! ””Backer 11,822 - belts have arrived in Perth, Western Australia. I'm now fortunate enough to have all three generations of smart belts in different designs. Thank you! ””Congrats on completing another successful project.I've backed all three of your smart belt kickstarters so far and I have to say they keep getting better each time.This one, I like the new ""gator"" texture, it's a nice upgrade. And I love the new minimal buckle, it's much more comfortable while sitting. Thanks! ””GuysThis belt is amazing! Truly! No more holes that get destroyed by normal use, making it so easy to change between trousers ! And the micro adjustment from the ratchet system is genius.My suggestions for mk4 are the following:-A wider belt and buckle for jeans.A complete woman’s range with colours and buckles tailored to the female of the species. My wife thinks this belt is brilliant but a bit manly (obviously lol)Thank you again! It’s the last belt I’ll buy, except another from you when you do this again lol””Arrived in Melbourne, Australia. Looks great, easy to use once I realised that loosening works by first pulling to tighten and while doing that pushing the button is effortless since holding to tighten it releases the pressure on the button from the ratchet mechanism. ””the smart belt was fantastic good! very convenient. is there any chance i could buy another one? or u guys making 4.0 soon? ””Hi I received my belt and it's perfect ! How can I purchase another one ? ””Best belt ever so far. Have 4 of them plus some more as gift. Can’t wait for more colors such as burgundy. Make sure the color stays on. Thanks and happy new year to your team. ””I have both SMART BELT 2.0 and 3.0 , love them much, looking forward your SMART BELT ""4.0"" !! Cheers””I received it pair of weeks ago and it’s fantastic! Well done creators!! When you decide to make the 4.0 I’ll buy another, perhaps 2. Happy New Year! ””Received the belts today.... brilliant product.THX””I got the belt and its great, everything I've ever imagined. thanks! ””Received the belts today in Taiwan. Quality is great! Buckle is easy to use, color is great, like the product. Thank you””Received the belt today in the Netherlands. My first opinion is that I love it! ””Mine arrived today. Love it, thanks””Finally got the belt, love it””I ordered 4 belts that were given as Christmas gifts. The belts are sensational. Extremely well made and feel luxurious.

It’s wonderful””Great belt guys! ””Received my belt and been using it everyday for the past few weeks now and I absolutely love it.

All perfect. My husband and sons love them! ””Received my belts and buckles yesterday. Fantastic product. Would like to see more buckle designs in future. 4.0? How about a titanium buckle? Would solve the allergy issue perhaps. ””Thanks for sorting out the issue with my order - the buckle was missing from my package but after mentioning that on here you corrected the issue and got the buckle a few days a go.

<p>Cafe Racer is a special kind of motorcycle and motorbike motion of 1960s in London. Gathered often in pubs and cafes motorcyclists came up with original entertainment – music race. Street racers had to cover a distance of about 2 km from cafe to a certain point and back while the song on the jukebox was playing.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508843425/dy1djlllxtlrzhhagslh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The serial motorcycles were not suitable for such events. So the riders began to improve them - to dismantle all the excess weight and to install fairings for less air resistance. The wheel was changed to clip-on. The elongated narrow fuel tank and a single seat became a distinctive feature of Cafe Racers.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508843465/l5o4wkvdalltjjca69rr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A motorbike has always been more than just a means of transport. It is part of a certain lifestyle, values and rules that bring together very different people moving in one direction with a sense of independence, uniqueness and confidence.</p>

After that we chose the best two factories and invested in the production of prototypes on both.

We use this approach in choosing any partners or suppliers and can guarantee you high quality and meeting your expectations.</p>

</div></div>","About the Project 
RIDER1991 is a wristwatch of a unique design with a crown embedded into the case. It is devoted to the idea of free movement and inspired by one of the designers' friend impressions from his road trip on an old motorcycle around his country as well as by the atmosphere and aesthetics of the Café Racer motorbike culture.

RIDER1991 watches are produced right now!  
In July 2017, RIDER1991 conducted successfully the campaign on Kickstarter where 227 baсkers from around the world supported our project and helped us to raise $27,689USD out of the $25,000USD expected.
This allowed us to launch successfully the mass production of the watches according to the plans. The producing is on its final stage now and we are preparing to deliver our watches to all the baсkers by the New Year of 2018 as promised.We thank all Kickstarter baсkers and are grateful in advance to all the Indiegogo baсkers for believing in our team and supporting RIDER1991 project.

RIDER1991 name consists of a word and a number by analogy with the approach to the name of famous motorcycles. RIDER is an independent traveller with no limit of age, language or status, seeking adventures in life. 1991 is a year when the watch creators Homeland started its own Free Movement in a History.

Motorcycles clear but gradually smoothed edges, diamond-shaped handles and seats, special shades of color, the combination of brown leather and black brushed metal are the basis of the RIDER1991 watch design.
The main emphasis of the watch design is a crown that resembles a motorcycle diamond shape throttle. It is located at the level of 2 hours and recessed into the watches stainless steel case. It is esthetic and allows the wrist to move freely while driving or other daily movements.Minimalistic design of the dial repeats some detail of a motorcycle speedometer. There are the Arabic numbers 6,7,8,9 symmetrically opposite the minute scale. The used font BDP GeLLY can be found at the numbers of racer motorcycles and cars in 60-70 years. 
The lugs emphasize the case and dial style. A special latch on the strap makes it easy to change.

5 basic models of the RIDER1991 were chosen. RIDER1991 offers the watches with black or white dial and with an aluminum inner ring brushed in silver, black, rose gold. And different color genuine leather and Mesh Band straps are proposed.

All watches are equipped with quartz movements Miyota GL30 and have 5 atmospheres water resistance.


Cafe Racer is a special kind of motorcycle and motorbike motion of 1960s in London. Gathered often in pubs and cafes motorcyclists came up with original entertainment – music race. Street racers had to cover a distance of about 2 km from cafe to a certain point and back while the song on the jukebox was playing.
The serial motorcycles were not suitable for such events. So the riders began to improve them - to dismantle all the excess weight and to install fairings for less air resistance. The wheel was changed to clip-on. The elongated narrow fuel tank and a single seat became a distinctive feature of Cafe Racers.
A motorbike has always been more than just a means of transport. It is part of a certain lifestyle, values and rules that bring together very different people moving in one direction with a sense of independence, uniqueness and confidence.

<p> </p></figure></div><div data-id=""23111992""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><i><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></i></p>
<p>Here at Kosan Travel Co., we stand behind all of our products. If we can't fix or repair a manufacturer's defect, we will replace the product.</p>
<p><strong>RETURN POLICY</strong></p>
<p>We offer a 30-day, no-risk return policy. If you are not 100% satisfied with the quality of the product within 30 days of receiving your order, simply send it back and we will refund you, no questions asked. But don't worry, we know you are going to love it!</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. Depending on where you are based, you may incur additional fees such as taxes and duties. As we are shipping these products worldwide, it is impossible for us to build in these variable costs for each location on Kickstarter.</p>
<p>All of our orders will be shipped out of our DC in the US.</p>
<p>For all of our Canadian friends and family, the new free trade agreement is expected to go into effect ahead of shipping which will mean no duty or GST for the first $150 imported (or in this case, one dress!). Should the government twiddle their thumbs all spring, this might not be in place ahead of shipment and you'd be responsible for duties and taxes in the event of import. We'll be looking at options closer to the date to see what we might be able to do to mitigate this.</p>
<p>We suggest using this tool to assist you in calculating potential duties: <br/><a href=""https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/</a></p>
<p>For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery.</p>
<p>Please note that Kosan Travel Co. cannot legally mark orders as gifts.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>If our shipping carriers attempt to deliver your package to you and you do not receive it because you are not there, the address was incorrect, or you moved without letting us know, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order once it arrives back at our warehouse. You will receive a tracking number for your package once it ships out, so please keep an eye out!</p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL SHIPPING DELAYS:</strong></p>
<p>The current timeline is to ship all rewards in June 2019.

That being said, we have incuded some breathing room in our production schedule to mitigate any potential issues.</p>

Between fabrics that wrinkle and smell awful after only one wear, to styles that have a complete lack of pockets, we were fed up.
 
 Our expert team has created the Kosan Go Travel Dress with the world traveller in mind. Designed to enhance your journey, it is loaded with traveller-friendly features that will keep you safe, organized, and looking your best.                                
 
 
 When travelling, versatility is key. You want to pack as little as possible while getting maximum wearability. The Kosan Go Travel Dress has an adjustable length; meaning regardless of the occasion, we’ve got you covered. 
 Comfort is king (or in this case queen), right? Our luxurious fabric has four-way stretch and just enough structure to ensure maximum comfort whether you’re sitting on a plane from Los Angeles to Australia, or biking through the backroads of Bulgaria.
 The Go Travel Dress has four hidden pockets for everything from your phone and passport, to your cash, cards & lip balm. There are two large side pockets that are hidden by the use of invisible zippers, and two slots in the bust area. Our fabric is naturally wrinkle resistant. Simply smooth out wrinkles with your hands, throw in the dryer, or hang up for a quick and easy fix. 
 Our fabric is treated with an anti-bacterial finish with odour-blocking properties. The Kosan Go Travel dress can be worn for multiple days without needing to be washed. 
 
 Our durable, quick-dry fabric is machine washable – meaning you will never have to worry about shrinkage or finding a dry cleaner. 
 Sweat-soaked clothing and outfit changes are one thing you won’t have to worry about with the Go Travel Dress. Our innovative technology wicks away moisture from the skin for significantly faster drying time and all-day comfort to take you from day to night. 
 Spending some time in the sun on your next adventure? Not to worry; the Kosan Go Travel Dress is rated up to 40+ UPF to ensure you’re always protected. The dress is also lined for added comfort and coverage. 
  
 
                                   
 Need help finding the perfect fit? Not to worry! Check out our handy sizing chart below or e-mail styleme@kosantravel.com for some personal assistance.You will have the opportunity to select both your preferred size and colour after the campaign ends when we send out surveys.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 After successfully launching our first product, the Kosan Travel Pack System and Kosan Packing Cubes right here on Kickstarter, we couldn't wait to share our next product with you.We believe that travel can effect positive change by inspiring new perspectives about the world you live in. The more you travel, the better off the world will be. We also know that the better prepared you are, the more you will be able to enjoy the experience. So, we’ve set out to build the best products for those who travel the world, and our mission is to help our travellers prepare for their journey. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. We wouldn't be here doing what we love if it weren't for all of you! If you have any feedback or questions, please let us know. We love to connect with other travellers.  We care just as much about how something is made and who made it, as we do about the end product itself. From the moment we decided to make a dress, our community of travellers helped us choose the style and colours. In true digital nomad style, our amazing team members were mostly remote during the process of designing the dress but we came together for fittings. We selected an expert dress factory in China and communicated with them every single day!One of the coolest parts of this campaign was working with Jordan Hammond, Sophia Pope, Lauren Meeker, Iassen Gortchova and Biliana Gortchova on shooting the video and some of the photos you see here. They did an amazing job and we can’t wait to work with them again (thank you guys!).We want to keep it real here and let you know that we will continually visit our factory partners face to face to check on the extraordinary work they produce. 
 
                                   
  
  
 
 Risks and challenges
Here at Kosan Travel Co., we stand behind all of our products. If we can't fix or repair a manufacturer's defect, we will replace the product.
RETURN POLICY
We offer a 30-day, no-risk return policy. If you are not 100% satisfied with the quality of the product within 30 days of receiving your order, simply send it back and we will refund you, no questions asked. But don't worry, we know you are going to love it!
CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION
Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. Depending on where you are based, you may incur additional fees such as taxes and duties. As we are shipping these products worldwide, it is impossible for us to build in these variable costs for each location on Kickstarter.
All of our orders will be shipped out of our DC in the US.
For all of our Canadian friends and family, the new free trade agreement is expected to go into effect ahead of shipping which will mean no duty or GST for the first $150 imported (or in this case, one dress!). Should the government twiddle their thumbs all spring, this might not be in place ahead of shipment and you'd be responsible for duties and taxes in the event of import. We'll be looking at options closer to the date to see what we might be able to do to mitigate this.
We suggest using this tool to assist you in calculating potential duties: https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/
For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery.
Please note that Kosan Travel Co. cannot legally mark orders as gifts.
SHIPPING POLICY
If our shipping carriers attempt to deliver your package to you and you do not receive it because you are not there, the address was incorrect, or you moved without letting us know, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order once it arrives back at our warehouse. You will receive a tracking number for your package once it ships out, so please keep an eye out!

<p><strong>Linden is a women's contemporary clothing line designed and manufactured in Los Angeles. The designs are always inspired by art, music, film, or literature, and strive to maintain both wearability as well as affordability. Every season produced is limited in quantity.</strong></p>
<p>As an independent fashion designer, sometimes designs are limited by cost. Affording all of the supplies as well as the presentation (trade shows, runways, etc) becomes a source of stress and as a result designs are often simplified or the best means of presentation is often not affordable. </p>
<p>So you know what you are helping to create, the inspiration for this collection is a book called <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle </span>written by Haruki Marukami. I began reading this book and was immediately struck with the unique language and vivid imagery. The book was translated from Japanese and sometimes the translation is such a beautiful combination of words that a native english speaker may never think to put together. Before I even knew what I was going to do with it, I started writing down sentences out of context. Ultimately, these series of phrases began to inspire the collection for Fall 2013. </p>
<p>This season I hope to get a head start on the Fall 2013 collection, being able to create a broader range of pieces as well as finishing them as they were originally designed. I always mean to get a head start on my samples, but find myself putting it off until I can afford the various elements that go into the collection. With the right funding I can get started right away, perfecting style and fit long before the actual presentation happens.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Showing in a trade show or runway show can cost at least $1500 and go way into the tens of thousands. Where a line shows has a huge impact on how the brand is percieved as well as who will be present to buy from it. At least half of this fundraising campaign will go toward presentation of the Fall 2013 collection simply to get the business in front of the right people. </p>
<p><strong>******UPDATE*******</strong></p>
<p>Linden has been accepted to show at Style Fashion Week Los Angleles <a href=""http://stylefashionweek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stylefashionweek.com</a></p>
<p>Held for an entire week at the beautiful Vibiana in downtown Los Angeles, Style Fashion Week always draws a strong audience filled with buyers, press and fashionably conscious celebrities.  </p>
<p>This means that <em>MORE</em> than half of the funds will go to production of this show. </p>
<p><strong>*********************</strong></p>
<p>The other half of the funds will go toward all of the supplies and materials that will be needed to complete the collection, as well as any work I will have to source out to specialists. </p>
<p>**YOU** as the generous supporters of the brand, will be rewarded! Some of you will receive original illustrations of this collection (I'm a pretty good artist, I swear, i'm totally trained!), some of you will receive clothing of your choice, and some of you will be publicly thanked either on our website or in our printed materials during that show! </p>
<p>Every little bit helps, so even if I do not raise the full amount, the funds will still go to support Fall 2013. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contibution, I can continue to make this brand grow. The goal is to present the best possible collection for Fall 2013, and begin to expand even more. I would love to hire assistants, and bring people into the business. Also, the more orders I receive, the more work I give to local manufacturers, helping to boost our economy. </p>

<h3>1.  Who Are We?</h3>
<p>5 Souls is an apparel and art company born from the Martial Arts and based in Los Angeles, CA.  It is owned and operated by us, German Baltazar and Eric Kohm.  Like many of YOU, we're Martial Artists and fans of MMA who can't find apparel we aren't embarrassed to wear.  With our years of experience training in a variety of disciplines, competing, and watching the sport of MMA evolve, we wanted to create a brand that reflects our passion for all of the Martial Arts and honors their origins.  </p>
<p>We are committed to YOU having MMA apparel and Art that you will be proud to show off.  We pride ourselves on creating unique designs that show YOU are a real Martial Artist, not just some beer-drinking MMA fan who has never trained and acts tough in his shiny shirt full of those same old MMA gimmicks like skulls, vikings, spartans...you get the idea. </p>
<p>We want YOU to become part of our community of like-minded individuals, not just by wearing our designs or displaying our art, but by becoming active participants on our blog where you can show off your soul.</p>
<p>Check out our website to learn more about us:  <a href=""http://www.5souls.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.5souls.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>2.  Our Intention.</h3>
<p>Our sights are set and we're ready to reclaim the Martial Arts Apparel industry for Martial Artists of all disciplines.  </p>
<p>Some of you may or may not know this about us, but we do EVERYTHING ourselves - the logo design, the shirt designs, the print designs, the website design, marketing material, blog posting, packaging, and shipping.  We're tired of keeping this to ourselves and want YOU to be part of this journey.  </p>
<p>That's why we've worked day and night to create our new collection called <em>The Greatest</em>.  With <em>The Greatest</em>, we've created a series of t-shirts, each of which pays homage to one of the greatest Martial Artists of all time, as well as a couple of prints.  We are confident that you will be proud to wear and display our designs, which in turn will allow more people to see that MMA is much more than drunk guys booing over barroom brawls.  Basically, we are developing a brand that will stand out from the rest because YOU stand behind it.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">3.  Your Contribution.</span></strong></p>
<p>How will your money be spent?  Well, by participating in our indiegogo campaign, you'll get the chance to preorder all of our items from <em>The Greatest</em> collection before they're even available at our own online store.  And with your preorders, we will be able to cover the costs of producing our new screens for the shirts, purchasing shirts for screening, printing our prints, and packaging and shipping it all to you.  With anything leftover, we'll be able to continue our goal of giving back to the Martial Arts through our endeavors with The Boys &amp; Girls Club, and our plan to host a free women's self-defense class at least once per month.  </p>

<p>Show us your soul.</p>
</div></div>","1.  Who Are We?
5 Souls is an apparel and art company born from the Martial Arts and based in Los Angeles, CA.  It is owned and operated by us, German Baltazar and Eric Kohm.  Like many of YOU, we're Martial Artists and fans of MMA who can't find apparel we aren't embarrassed to wear.  With our years of experience training in a variety of disciplines, competing, and watching the sport of MMA evolve, we wanted to create a brand that reflects our passion for all of the Martial Arts and honors their origins.  
We are committed to YOU having MMA apparel and Art that you will be proud to show off.  We pride ourselves on creating unique designs that show YOU are a real Martial Artist, not just some beer-drinking MMA fan who has never trained and acts tough in his shiny shirt full of those same old MMA gimmicks like skulls, vikings, spartans...you get the idea. 
We want YOU to become part of our community of like-minded individuals, not just by wearing our designs or displaying our art, but by becoming active participants on our blog where you can show off your soul.
Check out our website to learn more about us:  www.5souls.com.


2.  Our Intention.
Our sights are set and we're ready to reclaim the Martial Arts Apparel industry for Martial Artists of all disciplines.  
Some of you may or may not know this about us, but we do EVERYTHING ourselves - the logo design, the shirt designs, the print designs, the website design, marketing material, blog posting, packaging, and shipping.  We're tired of keeping this to ourselves and want YOU to be part of this journey.  
That's why we've worked day and night to create our new collection called The Greatest.  With The Greatest, we've created a series of t-shirts, each of which pays homage to one of the greatest Martial Artists of all time, as well as a couple of prints.  We are confident that you will be proud to wear and display our designs, which in turn will allow more people to see that MMA is much more than drunk guys booing over barroom brawls.  Basically, we are developing a brand that will stand out from the rest because YOU stand behind it.
3.  Your Contribution.
How will your money be spent?  Well, by participating in our indiegogo campaign, you'll get the chance to preorder all of our items from The Greatest collection before they're even available at our own online store.  And with your preorders, we will be able to cover the costs of producing our new screens for the shirts, purchasing shirts for screening, printing our prints, and packaging and shipping it all to you.  With anything leftover, we'll be able to continue our goal of giving back to the Martial Arts through our endeavors with The Boys & Girls Club, and our plan to host a free women's self-defense class at least once per month.  
4.  Here's How You Can Help.


We're not going to sugarcoat it.  GIVE US YOUR MONEY.  Give us $5, and we'll send you a sticker pack.  Or give us $10 and we'll add a custom post on 5souls.com to thank you and advertise your business/website to our thousands of website visitors.  Make it $20 and we'll let you choose one of our two prints to go with your stickers and custom website post.  If you'd rather a t-shirt of your choice from The Greatest instead of a print, just give us $25.  What's that?  You can't choose just one shirt?  Then make it $50 and we'll throw in two.  Wait, the designs are so good that you can't even settle on just two shirts?  Then give us $125, and you'll get all six shirts in the collection plus a seventh we've created specially for this indiegogo campaign.  Where are you getting seven shirts for only $125?  Here, that's where!  What did you say?  You want the shirts and both prints?  Okay, okay, make it $150, just $25 more and you will get The Greatest colletion in its entirety...prints and shirts.  You think we missed a Martial Artist?  Okay, give us $350 and not only will you get The Greatest collection in its entirety, but we'll also design a custom shirt or print inspired by the Artist of your choice.  
Equally, or perhaps more importantly, tell all your friends to give us their money.  Do so in a lawful manner, of course.  Seriously, spread the word even if you can't spare a dime to fund our campaign!  Like us on Facebook (www.facebook.com/5souls), follow us on Twitter (https://twitter.com/5_souls) and tweet out our indiegogo campaing, follow us on Tumblr (http://5-souls.tumblr.com) and reblog the campaign, and go to YouTube to ""thumbs-up"" our video and leave a nice comment.  We said nice!

<p> </p>
<p>Since day one of the prototyping phase, Pins Collective have worked closely with a manufacturer that has a well established reputation of moving projects like ours from the current prototype phase through the industrialization process and in to full scale production. This company have helped us with the sourcing of components and done all the CAD-work needed to design and create the final pin. They have also delivered the board prototype that we needed in order to show how the overall experience would be and how the reflective LCD works. We are very confident that we, with their assistance, have created a solid project plan for our coming stages.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494922892/a1qcfwvtmjd4l6ntv65u.png"" src=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p><br/>Up until now we have put a lot of emphasis on finding the right screen, perfected the design and user experience. The design work is completed, we have a functional board prototype, and the appearance models have been manufactured to perfection based on the 3D CAD models. We’ve also put a lot of effort into the app prototype, as we think it is key to the experience.</p>
<p>Our upcoming challenges are now on the technical side. In the current phase we are miniaturizing the prototype and putting the components within its final form factor. As this is something we at Pins Collective haven’t worked on before we rely on our technical partner for this to be made. Our resources have gotten us this far but in order to take the next step towards production, we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Pins Collective is a unique product with some new components that leaves us dependent on our suppliers and partners. However, most of the technology we use is well known and common in other products. The fact that we have teamed up with a well-established technology partner that has over 20 years of experience in taking products from a prototype phase like ours into full production.</p>
<p>We also teamed up with Swedish industrial design company People People on this project. They have an in-depth experience working with new concept and ideas - especially within the wearable industry. Any design issues that might arise going into production are in the hands of some the most talented designers out there.</p>
<p>Our main priority is to ensure the overall product quality of our sub component. We’ll reduce this risk by visiting our suppliers and be present during assembly and testing. </p>

The system itself is equipped with its own independent air filtration system, back up source for power in the case of the main power being interrupted, communication, and essentials for the children, and teachers.    Allocation of funds raised:$10,000- Launch of an E-Commerce website.$75,000-A nationwide advertising, and marketing campaign.$65,000-Additional testing for other applications within a retail driven marketplace for scalability. Testing would also place Simply IV Safety on the approved equipment list for FEMA.$100,000-Bringing on additional staffing, from administrative positions, to marketing, and sales staff.   We anticipate some speed bumps in the road along the way. However we truly believe that with the high demand of school safety initiatives by every state that we will be able to overcome them, by aligning ourselves with manufacturers, licensee's, large distribution centers. We have overcome most of the hurtles already by having the support of our home state Senators, Members of Congress, and Training Coordinator from Homeland Security for active situations in a school setting.   We hope that the Indiegogo community shares our vision, of a safe environment for our children, and their future.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We didn't want to start just ‘another clothing brand’ as we found most clothing labels are using inhumane sweatshops. So we've designed ethical clothing with meaningful messages to create positive social change. Humantra believes that the exploitation of people and the environment has to be stopped. Workers should be paid a wage that enables them to live in dignity. This campaign is our way of combating the negative effects of the fashion industry and we're giving 10% of all profits to Clean Clothes Campaign. We have spent a lot of time ensuring our products can trace an ethical and sustainable path back to their origins. If you are a person who values people over profit, you’re in the right place.   The clothing will be produced on a print-on-demand basis meaning that the clothes are made to order leaving zero-waste.For USA & Canada we use American Apparel. They employ over 10,000 people worldwide. Most of those jobs are in the USA with more than 6,500 employees at their LA-area factories alone. The t-shirts we use are part of their Sustainable Edition range that are made from 100% USDA Certified Organic and pesticide-free cotton. Currently we cannot source organic vests/tanks through our suppliers but as we grow this will change. For more information on the process behind their clothing go here.    For UK & Europe we use Earth Positive Clothing. They are recognised as one of the leaders in the global garment industry for the ethics surrounding the clothing production. The clothes are organic and ethically made, but crucially, manufactured solely using sustainable energy generated from wind and solar power in India. To see the story behind their garments you can see their latest video of Supermodel and Campaigner Lily Cole visiting the EarthPositive Supply Chain in India. For more information clothing go here.         In our own experience, we’ve had a number of start-up ideas with verypositive responses only to fail due to lack of funding. So, this is the test to see if people are willing to support us by voting with their money.Why $5000?Our vision is to spread awareness about the destructive aspects of the fashion industry, as one step toward creating a more balanced and harmonious planet.We have a 3-month marketing plan that will help us move forward with our vision. This involves getting independent artists, funky-fashionistas and sustainability-soldiers on board. Designing guerilla marketing campaigns, creating a studio and spreading awareness of fashion corporations that are not acting upon their promises for the good of garment workers and the planet as a whole. We hope you will support us in trying to make this work!We’ve brought together inspiration from nature, philosophy, spirituality and much more to create some truly captivating designs.Take a look for yourself… SIGNATURE LLE LOGOThis logo represents the whole ethos behind Live Learn Evolve - to live fully, learning and evolving through whatever life throws at us. BE HERE NOWThe timeless mantra popularised by Ram Dass. It means literally just that – to live in this moment. Not dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. “I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.” – Alan Watts      WHYFACEThis illustration explores the often erratic nature of the mind and our ability to find peace within ourselves. Reminding us to question everything.   EVOLVEIn nature we can observe the processes of evolution, we are all completely malleable organisms with infinite potential to live our lives fully. This design encapsulates this concept as Stephen Hawking said ""Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change"".       TRAVELER""What you seek is seeking you"" is one of the quotes entwined into this illustration that explores the role of our experience - both inner and outer - as we continue to walk and craft our own path.     YIN YANGThe basic philosophy of Yin Yang is harmony and balance. It describes how opposite forces are actually complimentary and interconnected in the natural world, and how they give rise to one another. We've created a novel twist by integrating the iconic peace and love symbols.CONNECTEDA subtle leaf pattern lies beneath the 'Connected' graphic, which represents the interconnection that lies between man and the Earth. As Terence Mckenna stated ""Nature is not mute it is Man that is deaf"" calling us to become more active global citizens.   QUOTE MANThis funky illustration contains quotes that have greatly influenced the artist in many ways. For instance ""Jobs fill your pockets, adventures fill your soul"" by Jamie Lyn Beatty and ""None but ourselves can free our minds"" by Bob Marley.             What is crowd funding?Crowdfunding is a way of raising finance, awareness and support for great ideas by asking a large number of people each for a small amount of money.What do I get for my money?For the money you pledge you will receive a reward - There is a reward section a short scroll up from this explaining what you will receive for each different cost.When can I expect delivery?We are unsure of how much support we will get from this campaign but we will aim to get the products out as quickly as possible, We have set the date to November 2016 to ensure that we can process all the orders if we become overwhelmed. When the company is up and running - Delivery in the UK will take 3-7 days and US will take 3-7 days.How will I be able to choose the desired clothing?You will be sent a survey after the Indiegogo is funded asking you which design(s) you have chosen.Is there a return policy?Unless the product is delivered faulty or broken we will be unable to process returns at this current stage in the formation of this company.

<h3>How it Started</h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277217/files/20150307223852-Tinkering2.jpg?1425796732"" src="""" style=""width: 609.491525423729px;height: 406px;""/></p>
<p>When we started to design the first svstem watch, we wanted to create a watch that could be easily personalized. We initially played around with different strap designs, but soon identified the bezel as the key component defining the character of a watch. It made us question, ""What if we could effortlessly change the bezel of a watch and dress it up according to mood or preference?""</p>
<p>It was from there that we started designing a mechanism for interchangeable bezels on a single watch base. We went with a 42mm diameter watch case as it best accommodated the bezel thickness we needed to accentuate the unique characteristics of each bezel.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<br/>What does svstem mean?</h3>
<p>Our name, svstem, is an adapted spelling of the word 'system', adapted to contain the acronym of our core brand attribute - seamless versatility, while also retaining the connotation of the word 'system' - <i>a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network</i>. </p>
<p>svstem speaks of functional utility over contrived exclusivity. With svstem watches, we seek to produce products that work flawlessly in the background, independent of any extra fanfare.</p>
<br/>
<h3>An Understated Confidence</h3>
<p>svstem represents an understated confidence, one that is refined enough to have little need for superfluous self-exaltation.</p>
<p>It represents the modern individual whose life is in constant transition towards their goals and aspirations, reflected by an identity that transcends beyond material status.</p>
<p>For them, there is no need for a superficial status. For them, there is svstem.</p>

Svstem Watches are high quality sartorial timepieces that feature a unique interchangeable bezel system, allowing you to switch easily between various looks and styles, providing seamless versatility within a single watch component.





On July 16th, the team made a corporate decision to rebrand their watches (formally known as 0815) under the new name of SVSTEM (pronounced 'system'). Click here to read the decision behind the name change.

All watches will display the updated logo featuring the word ""svstem"" instead of ""0815"".

</div></div>","A vision created by a color-blind designer (art scholarships through college) in combination with an x-Quirky industrial designer (over 20 products launched out of NYC). The goal of the seasoned DIALED team is to bring to life a series of premium minimalist designed products through an insane commitment to innovation and eliminating the unnecessary. The first product in the Dialed family of innovations is the Notebook Wallet. With over a dozen rich features, there's something here for everyone.


The vision for the Notebook wallet was to offer a pocket-sized storage solution that houses the essentials + a slim notebook for the serial note taker and doodler.
Materials Selection
In addition to our commitment to a slim profile, we are also committed to selecting quality materials while striving to maintain affordable pricing to make the brand very accessible to all demographics. Each wallet features RFID blocking properties for an added measure of security and peace of mind. 
 

The Small Notebook Wallet fits comfortably in your back pocket, a shirt pocket or toss it in your bag. The Large Notebook Wallet fits in a front pants pocket or strap it to your phone and carry it comfortably in your hand.





The large Wallet is also designed to carry your passport securely either in place of the notebook or on the opposite side. Choose your own adventure.

As soon as our campaign ends, we will be initiating the production of Verve Strapline bags.Please allow for 20 days to receive the funds we raised, we can expect to have the bags delivered to you within 2 months after the campaign. But hopefully, we will be delivering each of them to you sooner than this when everything is flowing smoothly.Is there a warranty for your bags?Yes, all Doué bags comes with a lifetime warranty for repair. As long as the condition of the bags are in repairable condition and not from a result of intended damage, we will repair the bags free of charge. All you need to do is contact us, leave you're information, and send in the bags! (Please note that all shipping costs to and from our workshop will be the obligation of the customer.)What sizes do Doué bags come in? Doué bags usually splits the bag in 5 different sizes: Mini, Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large.But while different bag types may be designed for different usage, the 5 different size would not be fully available for each bag type, but usually for the best possible size that suits it's using condition.All the bags will have it's size written by it's full name for you to easily recognize.Can we wash the bags?Yes and no, the Verve Strapline bags are made by a combination of custom ordered nylon and polyester materials. The textile also underwent a process of water resistant strengthening treatment.Throwing the bag directly into the washing machine or soaking it with water will possibly destroy the exterior treatment and lower it's durability.The best way to clean the bag if it became dirty would be lightly wiping the dirty area with a piece of cloth that was rinsed with water or pure alcohol. Doué
The word “Doué” characterize being talented,
gifted, and capable. So are we. But we have a bigger dream. We dream to
exercise our talents to bring everyone a selection to own a unique
characteristic with a bag that suits them. In the future, we also hope to become a platform in which all talent people could join our course to deliver good products to each and everyone that comes across our products.
In Doué, we search for infinite
possibilities to combine the beauty and functionality within simple daily life.
We believe practical goods can also be presented with a good taste. Thus, we
would thoroughly explore all the needs and possible using habit; just to
produce quality design based on practical daily behavior.

But this is not where we stop. We wanted better than that.

Our design are repeatedly observed, tested, and modified to become a
part of its user’s daily life, a life that presents a fine taste in living
quality. Doué’s bag aims to become an extension of
livelihood. With unique design, Doué’s bag
is not just a bag. It is a part of your outfit, a piece of you, which defines
who you are.

Through the hand of Doué's master artisan, every single piece
of Doué bag is handled like a priceless masterpiece. Hopefully, you will
easily locate your name on that one piece of Doué when
you are in touch with us.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

A line of shoes that blends sustainable materials & style with social impact

A movement to create social impact in a small, coastal fishing village in Jamaica



Bushouts will spread from the local village of Lucea into the rest of the Jamaican marketplace as affordable, quality shoes handcrafted by Jamaicans for Jamaicans. The line will include styles for casual and business wear. The goal is to provide a contemporary, well-crafted shoe that can be worn both casually and professionally.


Value to the World

Dignity. Pride. Empowerment.

Bushouts' core philosophy and aim are to create a brand that is sustainable to the community and to the surrounding natural environment. Bushouts is a social business, not a non-profit or traditional start-up. This means that Bushouts will implement a profitable business strategy guided by a social mission.

ETHICAL All workers will be paid a “living wage” - enough to support themselves and their families.
SUSTAINABLE In order to empower the environment all materials sourced will be recycled or natural to the existing environment. Bushouts will use natural fibers from hemp and bamboo, which are more sustainable and longer-lasting than most of their counterparts.
“Turning old truck tires into sandals can be a powerful business idea. For decades that has been the tradition, where everyone from farmers to fighters has fashioned worn-out road rubber into cheap, long-lasting footwear.” --The Guardian

CHARITY As Bushouts grows, profits will be funneled back into the community. Bushouts will be a co-op, partnering with the workers.



The Inspiration
From Founder, Josiah Leatherbury:
In the late 70's I lived in Jamaica. For over a year I lived and worked at the historic Casa Blanca hotel. Before I came, I was young and careless in my dealings with people. But to my surprise I found that the Jamaicans had a particularly calming influence on my character. I found them to be especially friendly, good-natured and always welcoming to strangers.  The wonderful way I was welcomed and treated caused a transformation in my life, and when I left the island I had become a better person because of my personal contact with the Jamaican people. I always knew  that some day I would return.


I am an artist and returned this year for a three-week trip, telling myself I was going there to paint. But after I arrived, I realized I had come not only to paint images of the beautiful tropical island, but also to once again interact with its wonderful  people. I became reacquainted with the country and the people in the rural town of Lucea. 

I became good friends with
some of the Jamaicans and they asked for my help.  I believe if someone is drowning, you throw

Our Story
The World of HUG was an inspiration of its founder Juan M Pimentel in search of creating the first entity solely focused on profit to maintain the growth of its charity and what we call giving margins.
The World of HUG located in Miami, FL was later founded by three individuals looking to make a difference in our future generation and set our footprint in the corporate world.
Our company looks to focus on giving as we have focused on profit margins in the past. While profit margins are important to keep us in business, our concept sustains our mission and helps thousands receive a product they need and cannot afford.
After coming together and experiencing the blessing of helping ninety-five children in different areas of Miami, FL we look to expand this venture and grow our concept into a new greater level.

</div></div>","What makes oombrella unique is its notification services that alert you before it rains and if you leave your umbrella behind.






















If you are a media: we have a press kit :)



 When it's forecast to rain outside soon, oombrella will send an alert to your smartphone EXACTLY WHERE you are and PRECISELY WHEN you need 



The service is based on our existing platform: wezzoo. A social and real-time weather service: We give a voice to the people so they can share the weather they are experiencing. oombrella users will do the same but seamlessly: Each oombrella will collect data and share it with the community to make hyperlocal weather data more accurate. 






 

Your smartphone will kindly notify you when you stray away (30/50m - 100/130ft) from the oombrella. Never leave it behind at the restaurant or anywhere else. 












The umbrella canopy is made with our finest shiny material. The result is a strong and beautiful canopy optimized to have the smoothest noise under the rain and the coolest bright effects. Furthermore, it's UV resistant and windproof!
We thought about everyone and decided to make three versions of the oombrella canopy. The Shiny, the Black Edition and the White Edition.


Whether you are enjoying the sun or standing under a hailstorm, oombrella will cover you properly and make you look forward to rain.



You can choose between 2 sizes:



""classic"" that is 95cm long (3.1 feet) with a curved handle


""fit-in-my-bag"" that is 25 cm long (0.82 feet) with a straight handle



Same services, same color options. Only the size is different!


With its kevlar-made ribs, oombrella can withstand the high winds that often come with heavy rain. Or storms. Or hailstorms. Or snowstorms. Or ...




The oombrella handle is also well thought out. The injected plastic ensures that the oombrella is waterproof. The capsule (see below), located at the end ensures a more comfortable, ergonomic and discrete grip.



There's an electronic capsule at the end of it, where the magic happens!



We have also integrated a buzzer and a light inside the capsule. Thanks to it you can be alerted on the go if you have an incoming call on your smartphone or a notification that you could miss otherwise.
We have other ideas for the buzzer and the light. If you too have ideas, let us know, we would be happy to hear them and see if we can integrate them in our firmware.



There's a screw thread on the top of oombrella. Now we let you re-imagine your oombrella by customizing it!
You can screw a camera, a GoPro, whatever you want that gets a screwing device.Maybe not the golf club we demoed in our video though ;-)



You can turn every umbrella into a connected one thanks to the ""capsule"".
It will perform the same functions (weather alert, forget-me-not alert, weather station) and will be attached to your umbrella on the handle be it a curved or a straight one.
The way to attach it onto your umbrella will either be a scratch or glue, depending on your feedback.











 

Everything happens on the handle of the oombrella and more precisely inside the ""capsule"".


The capsule is the brain of oombrella. This is where it feels, where it thinks and where it does the magic! With its range of sensors, oombrella is well-informed about:


how cold it is outside (temperature sensor), 


how high the pressure is (pressure sensor), 


how humid the air is (humidity sensor), 


and if you are on the dark side (light sensor).





This collection of sensors talks to your smartphone thanks to the Bluetooth Low Energy technology.







The app works in notification mode as shown before. But, if you enable the option, we can also track your usage of the oombrella by:



accessing all the stats of your last trip with your oombrella (duration, weather conditions, temperature and humidity you were exposed to),


browsing your global usage statistic history (number of days used, times used, weather history, ...)


seeing all the other oombrella community members in your neighborhood


discovering the last position of your oombrella when you took it with you





The features will be integrated into our existing app, wezzoo (ios/android)


oombrella is the result of teamwork. From the design to the electronic via the software, every single team member has had a part in developing the product we are proud to show you. And because everyone on the team has had their say, the product is the result of everybody's contributions:

The designers, Escabo design studio are fascinated by product design. They love to touch things and comment on it as if each material was a source of inspiration! They were picky about finding the right materials for the oombrella and this is thanks to them that we have the finest of product today.


The electronic Capsule has been thought and designed by EXOTIC SYSTEMS. The team is gathered around Guillaume, Julien and Laurent. They are really involved in turning quickly good ideas of connected objects into simple and robust electronic systems, ready for industrialization. EXOTIC created both a small and smart electronic. They have a sharp eye for detail and resulted in a great electronic device for the capsule. Here is the brain.

Vegetable tanning is an ancient method that uses tannin, a plant extract, to improve durability and provide colour. It is the most eco-friendly tanning process currently available and is 100% chemical free, unlike the modern method of chrome tanning. Only 10% of the leather used in the world is vegetable tanned. Vegetable tanning is a much longer process but we strongly believe that quality takes time and it is well worth the wait. </p><br/><p style=""text-align: center;"">Using vegetable tanned leather provides benefits that are essential to every monte &amp; coe. All of our bags are handmade in small batch sizes to ensure that each bag is meticulously crafted and unique. Our goal is to make every monte &amp; coe, as unique as you are. Using vegetable tanned leather allows us to do this. As you use your monte &amp; coe, the vegetable tanned leather will uniquely age with you. Exposure to sunlight, heat, and moisture will cause the vegetable tanned leather to develop a patina, providing you with a beautiful depth of colour. After years of wear, your monte &amp; coe will truly be one of a kind.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433794692/c0o7nfp44h9s1hm1bgf8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>PREMIUM ITALIAN WOOL FELT</b></h4><p style=""text-align: center;"">Premium Italian wool felt is a natural, versatile material suitable for all seasons.

It will add an unexpected flare to the everyday struggle. </p><br/><p style=""text-align: center;"">Wool felt provides every monte &amp; coe with unparalleled durability that can withstand every season.

<br/><h3>SAHARA</h3>
<p>The Sahara is one of the largest deserts in the world, covering most of North Africa and of similar size to the United States. Although the land covered by the Sahara is ever expanding, only two million people inhabit the area. Think about that: over 300 million Americans live within the same sized borders.</p>
<br/><br/><h3>REVELSTOKE</h3>
<p>For decades, helicopter and cat skiers from around the world have flocked to Revelstoke, British Columbia, attracted to its perfect powder, varied alpine terrain and quaint mountain community. Revelstoke boasts the most vertical lift-accessed terrain in North America at 1,713 m (5,620 ft). Revelstoke Mountain Resort is also the only resort in the world to offer lift, cat, heli and backcountry skiing from one village base. </p>

Presence on the strip is regarded as de rigueur for any brand wishing to proclaim the highest international standing.</p>

The artisan quality and effort that goes into every monte & coe bag is unrivalled for luggage in our price range. Our expert craftsmen use classic techniques that are rarely seen in modern manufacturing to ensure the quality of each handmade piece is second to none.SMALL BATCH SIZESDue to the handmade nature of every piece, we design and manufacture our bags in small batch sizes to maintain their integrity, unique design and personality.


Craftsmanship and Raw MaterialsFULL GRAIN VEGETABLE TANNED LEATHERAt monte & coe, we choose to use full grain vegetable tanned leather because of the quality and sustainability that it promotes. Vegetable tanning is an ancient method that uses tannin, a plant extract, to improve durability and provide colour. It is the most eco-friendly tanning process currently available and is 100% chemical free, unlike the modern method of chrome tanning. Only 10% of the leather used in the world is vegetable tanned. Vegetable tanning is a much longer process but we strongly believe that quality takes time and it is well worth the wait. Using vegetable tanned leather provides benefits that are essential to every monte & coe. All of our bags are handmade in small batch sizes to ensure that each bag is meticulously crafted and unique. Our goal is to make every monte & coe, as unique as you are. Using vegetable tanned leather allows us to do this. As you use your monte & coe, the vegetable tanned leather will uniquely age with you. Exposure to sunlight, heat, and moisture will cause the vegetable tanned leather to develop a patina, providing you with a beautiful depth of colour. After years of wear, your monte & coe will truly be one of a kind.PREMIUM ITALIAN WOOL FELTPremium Italian wool felt is a natural, versatile material suitable for all seasons. To find our wool felt we scoured the best mills throughout Italy. All of our wool is of premium quality. Our designs contrast the character of full grain vegetable tanned leather with the softer feel of wool felt. It will add an unexpected flare to the everyday struggle. Wool felt provides every monte & coe with unparalleled durability that can withstand every season. As an anecdote, think of the exterior of your monte & coe as a premium, designer peacoat. Your peacoat maintains its shape and quality for years throughout the most adverse weather conditions. Our Italian wool felt will stand the test of time and will maintain its durability and quality for years to come.OUR QUALITY IS WHAT SETS US APART. QUALITY IS WHAT WE DEMAND.We are confident our products will not only satisfy your style needs, but will provide pleasure in knowing your bag is 100% Canadian made from the best textiles available. Craftsmanship and design are our primary focus. Each piece is handmade in Toronto, in limited batch sizes, to ensure that it represents an unparalleled dedication to originality and versatility.

To make these watches even more exclusive, every Ferro AGL model / color will be limited to 500 pieces only guaranteeing that your watch will not be mass produced.

 
 
Here is how the watches look like with the Stretch Goal Zulu Straps. 

Design:
For the past year we have been working together with our Swiss Watch suppliers to  design and develop prototypes several times until the watches came to perfection.

 

Partnering with watch manufacturers in Switzerland with over half century of experience in watch making, we are very confident that our new Swiss Made Ferro Watches will surpass everyone's expectations. 
Our suppliers have been producing high end Swiss Timepieces for top brands that retail from $2000 to $5000. 
The Movements

 A work horse movement that never stops. Featuring Chronograph & Big Date

 

The 25 jewel ETA 2824-2 decorated movement will keep your time  accurate for a very long time. 

 
The 25 jewel Valjoux 7750 Chronograph decorated movement has been used widely by top Swiss Brands.

The Case
Ferro Watches are made from 316L stainless steel cases, offering high strength, durability and longevity as well as  great visual appearance due to its fine brushed finish.

The 42 MM wide case makes Ferro AGL watches fit perfectly on any wrist size for both men and women. 
ETA 2824-2 & Ronda Quartz Model Cases are 11 MM high, Valjoux 7750 Models Cases are 13.5 MM high.

 

The Straps
We have sourced the best materials to make extremely comfortable straps for these watches. Made with Italian genuine leather, the hand stitched straps will be on your wrists for years to come. 

The Dial
Reading time with Ferro Watches is easy. The numbers  on the dial are topped with strong luminescent coating so you can easily read the time in the dark.

 Top right is the Quartz Dial and the left is the Automatic Dial
Sapphire Crystal
Both Quartz and Automatic models will include thick double domed scratch proof Sapphire Crystal.

 
Sapphire is the most expensive glass crystal material and the most scratch resistant. It is a very hard, transparent material made of crystallizing aluminum oxide at very high temperatures.
 
Why Double Domed? The arch on both sides of the Sapphire Crystal  makes it better able to dissipate the forces of impact, and once treated with an inner A/R coating it looks like a quality lens.  The dial really ""pops"" sharp and clear.

<h3>Wear my Art</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Alisa, I'm 15, and I have a dream: I want to become a fashion designer. I drew since my childhood. I was a student at a prestigious British school Bedales. Now I'm studying art at the Royal Drawing Club.</p>
<p>Привет, меня зовут  Алиса, мне 15,  и у меня есть мечта: я хочу стать дизайнером одежды. Я рисую с самого детства,  у  меня есть начальная художественная подготовка.  Я была стипендиатом престижной британской школы Bedales. Сейчас я учусь в Royal Drawing Club.</p>
<p>I would really like to get to a summer course at an Art Academy in Florence. The school has Russian teachers who give the knowledge of anatomy and classical drawing which I need to start on my path to become a designer. I am inspired by works of Leonardo da Vinci. One of my favorite books is an album of his graphic works. I dream of visiting places where this great master lived and worked.</p>
<p>Я бы очень хотела попасть на летний курс в Art Academy  во Флоренции.  В школе преподают русские учителя, которые дают знания анатомии и  классического рисунка, необходимые мне, чтобы стать настоящим дизайнером. Кроме того, меня очень вдохновляет творчество  Леонардо да Винчи, моей настольной книгой является альбом его графических работ. Я мечтаю побывать в тех местах, где жил и творил этот великий мастер.<br/> <br/><strong>I started this company to study art in Florence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Эту компанию я начала для того чтобы поехать учиться во Флоренцию.</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember how your professional development began, how difficult it was at the beginning of the journey? Probably at that time there were people who supported and helped, those who believed in you at the start. Today I ask you to believe in me and help me make the first steps towards realizing my dream and to collect money for a trip to Florence. To cover all the costs associated with training, I need £ 6,000.</p>
<p>Вы помните, как начиналось ваше профессиональное становление, как трудно было в начале пути?  Наверное, в это время находились люди, которые поддерживали и помогали, те, кто поверил в вас на старте. Cегодня я прошу вас так же поверить в меня и помочь мне сделать первый шаг к осуществлению мечты: собрать деньги на поездку во Флоренцию. Для того чтобы покрыть все расходы,  связанные с обучением, нужно £ 6000.</p>
<p>Dreaming of Florence, I do not sit by idly: I constantly draw, I develop my sketches and models. Today I am proud to present you my first design work: a silk scarf with print in orange-blue tones.</p>
<p>Мечтая о Флоренции, я не сижу, сложа руки: я постоянно рисую, разрабатываю свои эскизы и модели. И сегодня я с гордостью представляю вам мою первую дизайнерскую работу: шелковый платок с принтом в оранжево-синих тонах.</p>
<p>I have made my first wearable piece to be an atlas silk scarf. It will be made in a luxury accessories factory and be a classic 70x70cm size. </p>
<p>There are two halves to this scarf; the warm, orange toned sky and the cool, wave filled sea.</p>
<p>This scarf is made to be personal. It’s not your average scrunch-it-up-and-go scarf, you can do much more than that. With the aid of the two opposite sides, you can create multiple looks that can fit any occasion and become a statement piece. Due to its universal size, 70 by 70cm, it can be worn on any part of the body and folded in any way. It doesn’t even have to be used as a scarf, but as anything you want!</p>
<p>Платок выполнен на натуральном шелке в классическом размере 70х70 см. Он создан специально для того чтобы подчеркнуть индивидуальность  его обладателя. В зависимости от настроения, костюма и ситуации его можно носить на «холодную» или «теплую» сторону, повязывать как классический шейный платок, бандану или косынку.</p>
<p>My intention with this piece is to make it as personal for you as it is to me. I want you to be able to influence how it’s seen and expressed and be able to feel many things whilst wearing my design.</p>
<p>Based on you suggestions, there will be an affordable version of the scarf made of a mix material – 30% silk, 70% cotton – which looks and feels remarkably close to atlas silk, but yet is very affordable.</p>
<p>У меня есть пробная партия из 25 шелковых платков, которые можно купить прямо сейчас. Также на мои работы можно сделать предзаказ. Платок выпускается в двух вариациях: классической  -- на смешанной ткани (30% шелка и 70% хлопка) и премиальной -- на натуральном атласном шелке.</p>
<p>When I become a famous designer, I will pass this on, helping those who, like me today, need support in pursuit of their creative ideas.</p>
<p>Когда я стану известным дизайнером, я передам эту «эстафету» дальше, помогая тем, кто так же, как я сегодня,  нуждается в поддержке и деятельном участии.</p>

Hello, my name is Alisa, I'm 15, and I have a dream: I want to become a fashion designer. I drew since my childhood. I was a student at a prestigious British school Bedales. Now I'm studying art at the Royal Drawing Club.
Привет, меня зовут  Алиса, мне 15,  и у меня есть мечта: я хочу стать дизайнером одежды. Я рисую с самого детства,  у  меня есть начальная художественная подготовка.  Я была стипендиатом престижной британской школы Bedales. Сейчас я учусь в Royal Drawing Club.
I would really like to get to a summer course at an Art Academy in Florence. The school has Russian teachers who give the knowledge of anatomy and classical drawing which I need to start on my path to become a designer. I am inspired by works of Leonardo da Vinci. One of my favorite books is an album of his graphic works. I dream of visiting places where this great master lived and worked.
Я бы очень хотела попасть на летний курс в Art Academy  во Флоренции.  В школе преподают русские учителя, которые дают знания анатомии и  классического рисунка, необходимые мне, чтобы стать настоящим дизайнером. Кроме того, меня очень вдохновляет творчество  Леонардо да Винчи, моей настольной книгой является альбом его графических работ. Я мечтаю побывать в тех местах, где жил и творил этот великий мастер. I started this company to study art in Florence.
Эту компанию я начала для того чтобы поехать учиться во Флоренцию.
Do you remember how your professional development began, how difficult it was at the beginning of the journey? Probably at that time there were people who supported and helped, those who believed in you at the start. Today I ask you to believe in me and help me make the first steps towards realizing my dream and to collect money for a trip to Florence. To cover all the costs associated with training, I need £ 6,000.
Вы помните, как начиналось ваше профессиональное становление, как трудно было в начале пути?  Наверное, в это время находились люди, которые поддерживали и помогали, те, кто поверил в вас на старте. Cегодня я прошу вас так же поверить в меня и помочь мне сделать первый шаг к осуществлению мечты: собрать деньги на поездку во Флоренцию. Для того чтобы покрыть все расходы,  связанные с обучением, нужно £ 6000.
Dreaming of Florence, I do not sit by idly: I constantly draw, I develop my sketches and models. Today I am proud to present you my first design work: a silk scarf with print in orange-blue tones.
Мечтая о Флоренции, я не сижу, сложа руки: я постоянно рисую, разрабатываю свои эскизы и модели. И сегодня я с гордостью представляю вам мою первую дизайнерскую работу: шелковый платок с принтом в оранжево-синих тонах.
I have made my first wearable piece to be an atlas silk scarf. It will be made in a luxury accessories factory and be a classic 70x70cm size. 
There are two halves to this scarf; the warm, orange toned sky and the cool, wave filled sea.
This scarf is made to be personal. It’s not your average scrunch-it-up-and-go scarf, you can do much more than that. With the aid of the two opposite sides, you can create multiple looks that can fit any occasion and become a statement piece. Due to its universal size, 70 by 70cm, it can be worn on any part of the body and folded in any way. It doesn’t even have to be used as a scarf, but as anything you want!
Платок выполнен на натуральном шелке в классическом размере 70х70 см. Он создан специально для того чтобы подчеркнуть индивидуальность  его обладателя. В зависимости от настроения, костюма и ситуации его можно носить на «холодную» или «теплую» сторону, повязывать как классический шейный платок, бандану или косынку.
My intention with this piece is to make it as personal for you as it is to me. I want you to be able to influence how it’s seen and expressed and be able to feel many things whilst wearing my design.
Based on you suggestions, there will be an affordable version of the scarf made of a mix material – 30% silk, 70% cotton – which looks and feels remarkably close to atlas silk, but yet is very affordable.
У меня есть пробная партия из 25 шелковых платков, которые можно купить прямо сейчас. Также на мои работы можно сделать предзаказ. Платок выпускается в двух вариациях: классической  -- на смешанной ткани (30% шелка и 70% хлопка) и премиальной -- на натуральном атласном шелке.
When I become a famous designer, I will pass this on, helping those who, like me today, need support in pursuit of their creative ideas.
Когда я стану известным дизайнером, я передам эту «эстафету» дальше, помогая тем, кто так же, как я сегодня,  нуждается в поддержке и деятельном участии.
This is a big challenge for me, so I need your help to turn my art into great things for you to wear.  All you need to do is… Wear my Art! 
Buy my scarf! Flaunt it! And don’t forget to check my Instagram and Facebook. The designs that get most likes are the ones I’ll be developing next! 
Все, что вам нужно сделать, это ... Носить мое Искусство!Купи мой шарф! Выставляй напоказ! И не забудьте проверять мои Instagram и Facebook. Идеи, которые получают большинство симпатий, я буду разрабатывать дальше!

I also believe strongly in giving back, so for every scarf sold I am going to donate 10% to a charity which once helped me, when I desperately needed support in funding my education.

<p class=""p1""><strong>To Start Off</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">We are a group of passionate young adults who came together with a single dream and are now working very hard to make it come true. We are all friends from Montreal and we all share the dream to make MDC bigger than it is now. We want to make our clothing known world wide and be suited for anyone and everyone!</p>
<p class=""p2"">We started off with 5,000$ to get our website, web hosting, clothing made and shipped to us, some new equipment, and spend hours upon hours writing business plans and working to make everything as perfect as we can. As you may know 5,000$ gets you somewhere but not super far. We are lucky we even got to start with that but we wish to take it to the next level! This company will change our lives forever but not only that help the economy all around the world slowly making it a better place. We have huge goals.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We are not just another clothing store. We have unique high quality clothing and also are a social online community. We will be doing reviews on products, restaurants, clubs etc. and we will also be doing tutorials for makeup, hair, food, drinks and will also be doing vlogs to keep in touch with our followers! We have our main brand MDC but also sub brands to describe styles for example MDC Riot Essence is a punk rock grungy look. this is just one of our looks of course. It may seem like a lot but we are very organized and have this all displayed in an innovative way.</p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">We need about 100,000$ to 160,000$ to get this fully running and perfectly set. The reason for this is because of all the expenses and trying to make this as great as we possibly can! the money will be used for the following.</p>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Web hosting and domain name (high speed and top stats)</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Storage. We wish to rent out a warehouse to hold our stock since we are starting online. It will be much easier to order a bunch of stock at once and store it and ship it out than it would be to have a small stock, get new orders, have them made, etc etc...</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Creating, Designing, and Fabricating all the cloths.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Having the items shipped to us here in Canada from our factories out east. Shipping from China is not cheap especially when ordering in large amounts. We may also be having our clothing made in India and Italy</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>Advertising with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Business Cards, And Promotions.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>We later wish to purchase a building for our main office, studio, some storage, etc. This will help us with organization and have a proper main office for customer service, shipping and editing. We will also be doing our videos and photo shoots here. This won't be included in the amount donated here. we wish to save up from our work to put a 30,000$ down payment on the building in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li>And finally the boutique. We wish to have stores all over north america and then world wide but first starting in montreal. This may come in the future after business is going well with the online site. We need to grow in order to get to our bigger goals!</li>
</ul>
<p class=""p5""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">When you donate we will thank you personally and depending on how much you donate there will be nice rewards for you since you are helping us grow.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If we do not reach our exact goal however, that will not stop us! we will keep going no matter what to make our dreams come true. What ever we make we will put all into the company and keep on pushing through! We won't let you guys down! :)</p>
<p class=""p5""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>The Importance of MDC</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">As you know we only started out with 5,000$. We worked hours upon hours at minimum wage jobs saving all the money we could get until we finally reached 5,00$ and said let's start with this. We still work so hard to bring in money but our first milestone was 5,000$. So this all means so much to us through our blood sweat and tears we will never give up! there is more of an incentive involved as well. We have tried to get investors with us but no one seems willing to invest in a company that is just starting up and some people just don't have faith. That's where you guys come in and make a difference!</p>
<p class=""p2"">We wish to use our profits to make the business run as pest as it can. Help our selves from a hard life to one that is a little easier and last but not least. Help the world as best as we can. We truly wish to franchise our stores world wide creating jobs for people and helping the economy but in some places around the world we want to actually build farms and homes for people who don't have anything in their country. We truly do want to help people we always did our whole lives but never had the power to. It seems selfish but it really isn't. You can't help anyone if you can't help your self so we wish to create a company that literally is for everyone and make the world a better place one step at a time.</p>
<p class=""p2"">We already have orders coming in of 500$ and more and we are not even open yet!!! that right there shows people like what we are doing already and want to help us. We are truly unique and have real goals for us and the world. We are a legally registered company under Quebec and Canada and that was no easy task.</p>
<p class=""p5""> </p>
<p class=""p6""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p class=""p7"">So please if you can donate anything you possibly can to help us all make a change. This isn't a charity at all. This is a company of our dreams with good intentions. If you absolutely can not donate we understand but if you still want to help, share this with everyone you know and try to get them to donate! It will be worth it! Indiegogo has it's own sharing tools that help the sharing process so please go ahead and donate or share with everyone you know.</p>
<p class=""p8""> </p>
<p class=""p7"">Thank you all so much. Let's make it happen!!</p>

Web hosting and domain name (high speed and top stats)


Storage. We wish to rent out a warehouse to hold our stock since we are starting online. It will be much easier to order a bunch of stock at once and store it and ship it out than it would be to have a small stock, get new orders, have them made, etc etc...


Creating, Designing, and Fabricating all the cloths.


Having the items shipped to us here in Canada from our factories out east. Shipping from China is not cheap especially when ordering in large amounts. We may also be having our clothing made in India and Italy


Advertising with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Business Cards, And Promotions.


We later wish to purchase a building for our main office, studio, some storage, etc. This will help us with organization and have a proper main office for customer service, shipping and editing. We will also be doing our videos and photo shoots here. This won't be included in the amount donated here. we wish to save up from our work to put a 30,000$ down payment on the building in the future.


And finally the boutique. We wish to have stores all over north america and then world wide but first starting in montreal. This may come in the future after business is going well with the online site. We need to grow in order to get to our bigger goals!

 
When you donate we will thank you personally and depending on how much you donate there will be nice rewards for you since you are helping us grow.
If we do not reach our exact goal however, that will not stop us! we will keep going no matter what to make our dreams come true. What ever we make we will put all into the company and keep on pushing through! We won't let you guys down! :)
 
The Importance of MDC
As you know we only started out with 5,000$. We worked hours upon hours at minimum wage jobs saving all the money we could get until we finally reached 5,00$ and said let's start with this. We still work so hard to bring in money but our first milestone was 5,000$. So this all means so much to us through our blood sweat and tears we will never give up! there is more of an incentive involved as well. We have tried to get investors with us but no one seems willing to invest in a company that is just starting up and some people just don't have faith. That's where you guys come in and make a difference!
We wish to use our profits to make the business run as pest as it can. Help our selves from a hard life to one that is a little easier and last but not least. Help the world as best as we can. We truly wish to franchise our stores world wide creating jobs for people and helping the economy but in some places around the world we want to actually build farms and homes for people who don't have anything in their country. We truly do want to help people we always did our whole lives but never had the power to. It seems selfish but it really isn't. You can't help anyone if you can't help your self so we wish to create a company that literally is for everyone and make the world a better place one step at a time.
We already have orders coming in of 500$ and more and we are not even open yet!!! that right there shows people like what we are doing already and want to help us. We are truly unique and have real goals for us and the world. We are a legally registered company under Quebec and Canada and that was no easy task.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
So please if you can donate anything you possibly can to help us all make a change. This isn't a charity at all. This is a company of our dreams with good intentions. If you absolutely can not donate we understand but if you still want to help, share this with everyone you know and try to get them to donate! It will be worth it! Indiegogo has it's own sharing tools that help the sharing process so please go ahead and donate or share with everyone you know.
 
Thank you all so much. Let's make it happen!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Gold vermeil findings from Bali (closures, crimp beads, covers, etc.)

Gemstones from Jaipur, India (Have you seen the gorgeous gems that Indian brides wear? Wow! Just wow!)
Oregon Sunstone mined and cut in Oregon (a drop of Oregon Sunstone is heaven)

Materials for custom displays 

Marketing materials
Cool packaging 

And it'll take my crafty hand and your generous support!




But where will we find the goods? 
Your support will also help me get my website up and running, a new and improved etsy shop launched, and plans for pop-up shops and trunk shows. 


Share me with everyone! 

You can also lend me a huge hand by passing the link to my Indiegogo campaign as far and wide as possible. 
Big thanks for your consideration! :)",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kate Fishwick. I have been crafting jewelry for about 10 years now. It all started when I needed to do something creative as therapy after a series of hospital stays. I needed an outlet for my energy and mind.</p>
<p>I am bipolar and on disability. I am very good at living within my means, but there is nothing left over after bills and food for crafting supplies.<br/></p>
<p>The goal for this year was to get a part time job in order to fund crafting and pay for a couple of craft shows that I want to do. I applied recently at a couple of places, but will have to turn down the offers if they come in. I have a hospital stay coming up to see if I do in fact have epilepsy, and then another to change medication around. I don't feel that I can get a part time job, yet, and then turn around and tell them ""Oh by the way, I have to be gone for a month."" </p>
<p>For a while I sold my jewelry at craft shows and festivals, and to friends and family. Today I give my jewelry as gifts or donations. I very much love to see people wearing my goods, and the smiles it brings me is well worth everything that goes into my creations. </p>
<p>Recently I wanted to add a couple of crafts to my portfolio. I want to upcycle gently used clothing into new and fantasy related creations, and add metal working into my jewelry. I would like to attend a few shows this year with some new crafts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Crafting keeps me busy and my mind at ease. I have been out of the crafting loop for about a year now, and am ready to get back to it. I am not looking to make it rich off of my crafts, it brings me great joy to give away or donate my goods. I do like sharing with the world though and this would also allow me to do a couple of festivals this summer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>My campaign goal is $500. After much research this is how much I have estimated I would need to get the supplies for metal working and used clothing for sewing. The metal working supplies will run about $300 and I figure $200 will get me a great deal of used clothing and beads for use in sewing and jewelry. If the goal is not met, what has been raised will still go toward metalworking supplies and festival fees.</div>
<p>Each level of donation will get you a Kate creation as my friends call them. From earrings to sets. Pictures of what is available are on my Facebook profile. These are pre-made items, but you get to pick what you want. There are some chainmail pieces left which will also be in that album entitled ""Donation Perks"".</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If any of you could share this on the social sites that would be awesome and you have my thanks in advance!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have a passion to create an interactive and innovative solution to the athletic shoe industry. After struggling with painful flat feet for the majority of my life, I've gone through most solutions available to make my feet feel better. I had huge, unattractive shoes and orthotics that gave me some relief when I wore them, but weren't versatile or durable. I've also had orthtics that were supposed to fit my athletic shoe collection. but sadly only fit a small amount of my shoes, leaving me to choose between foot painor unattractive shoes. I figured that I shouldn't have to choose between the two anymore; therefore, my company Ushu -a play on words that means ""your shoe"" -was created.</p>
<p>I created my company in hopes of creating a way for me to have comfort and aesthetics when it came to athletic shoes. I decided I to create a machine that individuals could step on, get an accurate reading of their foot issues, have a digital insole created and displayed on a screen, and have the option to design a shoe around the insole. The information would be sent to a major shoe distributor and the shoes would be sent to the customer. This process would find the happy medium between fashion and function. There shouldn't have to be sacrifice for wearing athletic shoes and Ushu plans to eliminate that problem. </p>
<h2>*With your contribution, Ushu can create an interactive website for individuals to design shoes from scratch by combining different components of existing shoes, changing colors, and adding their own artwork. This website will be the second component of the company; when individuals step on the machine, their insoles will be saved inside a database so they can design shoes at home through the website.</h2>
<h2>**If $70,000+ is collected, I will be able to do a lot more in terms of creating the machine seen in the slides video.  </h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $39,000 I need to raise creates this interactive website. In exchange, I am offering Ushu merchandise. If I don't reach my goal, I can do other important things for my company, especially on the web end. Any contribution does help my cause. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The value in this idea is the innovation. I am creating a new way to buy and create shoes that will be more accurate and help individuals of all ages. Although this is a new concept, I've plenty of expertise in athletic shoes and foot anatomy. I want this machine to be seen around the world and be available for individuals to use in their nearest athletic shoe retailer. </p>

<h2>
<strong>HOW IT ALL WORKS</strong> </h2>
<p>Here's a description of how'd you use the machine.</p>
<p>1. Remove any footwear on your feet and step on the foot pad</p>
<p>2. The machine scans your feet and displays a 3D image of them on the screen; it then describes any anomalies present</p>
<p>3. The software creates a insole solution against the 3D image of the feet that will add comfort to the feet</p>
<p>4. You are able to either match the insoles to a pre-existing shoe or create a shoe from scratch around the insole</p>
<p>5. If you'd like to make another shoe, simply log onto your account a create one around the insole(s) in the database  </p>

Just enough was raised to meet our minimum order quantity. We've been attempting to raise funds for something big through launching sustainable products like our upcycled billboard wallets and these sunglasses. 
The truth is that on the back end of the company, we're developing an e-learning platform for action sports and increasing general human potential. We already have video sessions recorded from professional athletes to adventure based psychotherapists on topics like how to use fear to achieve success to research based methods for increasing your happiness, efficiency, and flow. Seriously awesome stuff.

<p>The movement is arguably the most pivotal aspect of the watch. High Street / fashion branded watches lean towards quartz movements. At Duzu Watches, all our watches are <strong>powered by precision automatic movements</strong>.</p>
<p>We made a conscious decision to power this pilot watch with the <strong>Japanese made Miyota 9122 premium automatic movement</strong>. Miyota is synonymous for producing movements with high precision and durability.</p>
<p>The 26-jewel movement has a hacking-second function and power reserve of 40 hours. You have the choice of either winding manually or letting it self-wind from your wrist's kinetic motion. Having a frequency of 28800 vibrations per hour means you get a very smooth sweeping second hand that ticks eight times in a second.</p>
<p>Key features of this movement include the day, date and month functionality. </p>

<p>This pilot watch has been designed to suit a range of wrist sizes. With our straps we chose a combination of Cordura and leather.</p>
<p>Cordura is built to last. It’s the go-to material for the military for its durability, abrasion resistance and ability to withstand extended outdoor use in extreme conditions with confidence.</p>
<p>Leather on the inside of the strap provides a level of sophistication and eliminates odours often associated with wearing of synthetic materials.</p>
<p>Each of the three pilot watch models has a different leather depending on the luminescent pigment of the selected watch. The colours of the lume and leather are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>BGW9 Lume - Grey Leather</li>
<li>C3 Lume - Green Leather</li>
<li>Dark Orange Lume - Orange Leather</li>

<p>The straps are beautifully finished with double stitching and a custom titanium brushed finished signed buckle. </p>

On February 20, 2020, we received a letter from lawyers acting on behalf of Lockheed Martin advising us that we had to cease utilising images, videos and the F-35 text on our campaign pilot watch. We have subsequently removed the F-35 text from the dial and caseback of our watches. 
It is most likely that we would be replacing this with text that is more in keeping with our P-Series watch of which this is the first. The sihouette on the caseback will be updated accordingly.
We will be updating all Backers via email of the changes. We sincerely apologise to Lockheed Martin and all our Backers.
We have temporarily suspended taking pledges until we resolve a few design issues.

Building on the success of my first Kickstarter campaign, I am are delighted to be launching my new pilot series of premium quality watches, the P-Series. 
I have always had a fascination for military styled watches. I'm sure I am not alone and that there are many who have the same interest as what I do. I've admired many watches (well, lets be honest who hasn't?). The biggest issue I've had is finding one that fits nicely into my budget, that has a decent movement, is made from quality materials and has a that distinctive military/pilot look and feel to it.

The dial indices and markers watch hands and crown logo are filled with industry-leading Superluminova luminescent pigment. Superluminova lume was chosen for its bright and long-lasting glow.
The range is available in 3 lume pigments:

Its meticulously detailed with the watch specification beautifully articulated through the use of artwork which has been acid etched into the caseback.
 


The movement is arguably the most pivotal aspect of the watch. High Street / fashion branded watches lean towards quartz movements. At Duzu Watches, all our watches are powered by precision automatic movements.
We made a conscious decision to power this pilot watch with the Japanese made Miyota 9122 premium automatic movement. Miyota is synonymous for producing movements with high precision and durability.
The 26-jewel movement has a hacking-second function and power reserve of 40 hours. You have the choice of either winding manually or letting it self-wind from your wrist's kinetic motion. Having a frequency of 28800 vibrations per hour means you get a very smooth sweeping second hand that ticks eight times in a second.
Key features of this movement include the day, date and month functionality. 
 


This pilot watch has been designed to suit a range of wrist sizes. With our straps we chose a combination of Cordura and leather.
Cordura is built to last. It’s the go-to material for the military for its durability, abrasion resistance and ability to withstand extended outdoor use in extreme conditions with confidence.
Leather on the inside of the strap provides a level of sophistication and eliminates odours often associated with wearing of synthetic materials.
Each of the three pilot watch models has a different leather depending on the luminescent pigment of the selected watch. The colours of the lume and leather are as follows:

BGW9 Lume - Grey Leather
C3 Lume - Green Leather
Dark Orange Lume - Orange Leather

The straps are beautifully finished with double stitching and a custom titanium brushed finished signed buckle.

Number of watches depending on your pledge
One watch roll/travel case

Hi, I’m Wayne McCay, founder and designer of Duzu Watches. Duzu Watches is an Australian based watch design studio. 
Our core philosophy is to create watches for the Urban Warrior with a sense of adventure, tool watches that are equally at home in the boardroom, wilderness or the ocean.
Since our launch in 2017, we have been focused on bringing a range affordable high quality watches to people who ordinarily would not be able to afford them.
- Wayne
 

Every pilot watch comes with a two (2) year warranty against manufacturing material defects. We will, within twenty four (24) months from the date of purchase, repair or replace the movement of your watch free of charge if the movement proves to be defective in material or workmanship under normal use.
The warranty does not cover damage arising from normal wear, scratches, accidents or misuse, or from any alteration, service or repair performed by any party other than Duzu Watches.
 

The watch ships from Australia to anywhere worldwide. You'll need to confirm any import duties you may be required to pay with your local customs office.
All shipping includes tracking and insurance.
 

Every project has associated risks. We are not immune to these. Manufacturing any item takes a lot of work, and sometimes things do not always go according to plan, with unexpected hiccups along the way. We have gone to great lengths to mitigate as many risks as possible that are within our control with the aim of delivering the product to you within the prescribed timeframe. For this reason we have aligned ourselves with a reputable manufacturer who prides themselves on keeping their customers informed without making unrealistic promises.
We will ensure that we keep our customers up-to-date during the production process. This will be done via regular updates.
Should any delays occur along the way with regards to production, we will be as transparent as possible to ensure that our backers are fully informed.",37.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>Gela's Story</strong></p>
<p>When Gela Wesh was thirteen, she discovered a fiery passion for fashion design. That was it for her: she had found her path in life, and there was no doubt in her mind that she was going to pursue it with all the vigor and force she could muster. Kurdish-born, though, she was up against daunting odds, her homeland torn apart by war. She developed into a creative and inquisitive young woman, learning the value that she took from it personally, each design a therapy session and of itself, and when she was 10, she relocated to Switzerland with her family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Early in her design career, long before she had gone professional, Gela found herself drawn to feathers – symbols for beauty and freedom, both values near and dear to her heart. As she accrued technical skills and honed her ability to create, she continued to embrace feathers, and when she debuted her collection ""Celebrate"" in 2013, feathers were prominent in two of the dresses.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578086118/ce4dgbrioitbvoeqtppq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Gela Wesh Label</strong></p>
<p>Simultaneous to her first collection launch, the Gela Wesh label came into being. A label standing for high-end apparel and emblematic of all of Gela's strength, skills, and personality, the Gela Wesh label was ostensibly a product of Zurich, Switzerland, although all the locations in which Gela had grown up figured squarely into the brand messaging as well, pieces of Iraq evident in the details and in Gela's vision, the inspiration hailing from there as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Principles &amp; Vision</strong></p>
<p>Through her fashion design, Gela has dared to <i>stand up </i>for her principles, refusing to compromise on her vision every step of the way. She believes strongly in fashion's power to shape and direct the world, and resolving to respect this power, she has held tight to her commitment to offering unique, thoughtful, and meaningful designs, focusing on strong women like herself and doing everything that she can to breathe fresh life into <i>haute couture</i>. To date, several of her designs have made appearances on world-class red carpets, including at the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards, and New York Fashion Week, where she showcased eight of her designs in September 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Her Artistry</strong></p>
<p>Gela has used a variety of materials for her apparel, including tulle, lace, satin, and real feathers, and her work includes both ready-to-wear collections and custom-tailored designs. Time and again, it is <i>intricacy</i> that has defined her designs – and yet it is an intricacy that is never overbearing, even deceptively simple at a glance. Rather than mass-producing or outsourcing her work, she puts a great deal of time and energy into every one of her designs, her team crafting every piece by hand right alongside her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Plans for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Looking toward the future, Gela plans to bring the Gela Wesh label to fashion exhibitions in Milan and Paris and start production on a new line of dresses. She has built up a backlog of ideas, all of which she is ready to bring to life, and she is eager to introduce her designs to a wider audience and step out onto the world stage. After the positive reception with which her designs were met at the Golden Globes and the Oscars, she is ready to continue to push forward and navigate whatever challenges may arise as she builds her label up to reach its full potential.</p>

</div></div>","As brothers, we've shared a lot growing up, including the dream of one day owning a real working Dick Tracy watch.

Not a toy or a smartwatch, but a high quality Dick Tracy watch that does three things: looks cool, tells time, and makes the call.  But, even after twenty five years of searching and waiting, it had yet to come true.  So, we made it ourselves!
 

 

 

Our design aims to capture the iconic look of the original Dick Tracy watch.

Designed by Nick Mathis (that's me!) with Autodesk's Fusion 360, the look and feel was iterated dozens of times right here in my own workshop using the Nomad 883 desktop CNC machine by Carbide3D.com and 3D printing from Shapeways.com.  The result is a blend of its iconic first comic strip appearance with the proper weight and comfort of a high quality timepiece that looks great with jeans or a suit.
 

 

This is not just a real Dick Tracy watch, it's the official one.

It wasn't enough for us to make the Dick Tracy watch real—we made it official.  By partnering with Tribune Content Agency, we developed a worldwide exclusively licensed timepiece that proudly represents the historic Dick Tracy brand.
 

 
Even Dick Tracy himself wears our watch!
The Dick Tracy team, Joe Staton and Mike Curtis, loved our 2016 model so much they drew it into the official Dick Tracy comic strip!  Now THAT'S official!
 

 
Longio Watch Company carefully crafts our design into a high quality timepiece.
Just like our popular 2016 models, the master watchmakers at Longio will continue to make the timepieces for our 2018 models with the same care and materials expected of a high quality dress watch.
 

 
Elite Manufacturing engineers and manufactures the Bluetooth speakerphone module.
Then, in 2017, we found the perfect engineering and manufacturing partner at Elite Manufacturing in Salem, NH to bring the watch to life.
Founded in 1986 by one of the originators of the SIM/SIP DRAM Module, Elite has decades of experience with designing and manufacturing microelectronic circuit assemblies right in the New Hampshire facility with their Tier 1 cutting-edge machinery. These geniuses (and Dick Tracy fans!) built an insanely compact speakerphone module that performs flawlessly with a clear sound on both ends of the call, battery life that lasts all day, and all the necessary functionality expected of a Bluetooth speakerphone wearable.

 

All the necessary details (plus a few extras) bring this historic watch to life.
Making the Dick Tracy watch real meant focusing on looking cool, telling time, and making calls.  But, we worked with our engineers to ensure our watch includes all the necessary features and specifications that make it useful and fun, too!
 

 
Choose from one of two strap lengths (regular or long) by measuring your wrist.
Want to know which strap length to choose?  Simply wrap a piece string or paper strip around your wrist, mark the intersection, then measure it on a ruler.  Likewise, you can use a flexible tape measure, if you have one.  If your wrist measures between 6.5"" to 8.25"", you can wear a regular.  If your wrist is 8"" to 9.75"", you may want to choose long.
 


 
After the success of our 2016 models, we're ready to take it to the next level.
In 2016, we made a collectible Dick Tracy timepiece to celebrate 70 years since its first comic strip appearance.  We've shipped them all over the world to hundreds of Dick Tracy watch fans just like us.  Thanks to their incredible support, we were able to fund the engineering for our 2018 models!
 

 
We need to raise $30,000 to manufacture our dream watch.
Manufacturing in low volume can make a product too expensive for the buyers and high volume manufacturing (to lower the retail price) is often too expensive for the makers.  This problem often keeps people from making great products like the Dick Tracy watch and can only be solved in two ways: hire experienced engineers to balance cost with quality (check!) and raise enough funds to manufacture in large volume (gulp!).
Backing this project makes it possible to manufacture a limited edition run of 1000 watches. Each timepiece itself will be made by Longio and all Bluetooth modules will be manufactured and assembled into the watches by Elite Manufacturing.  Once complete, Nick and Charlie will personally quality assure, polish, package, and ship each watch right to your door.

<p>We invented a high-strength neodymium magnetic button that slides apart for more comfort. When your feel pressure on your waistband in certain situation like sitting, the button slides apart or un-pops itself and but when you stand or are in a more relaxed position it automatically reconnects. Don’t worry it doesn’t come undone when hiking or walking around town.</p>

<p>Most travel or outdoor pants go with a durable water repellent (DWR) additive and show Fancy pictures or video of Wine splashing off the clothing leaving the clothing pristine. </p>
<p>While it looks amazing at first, the DWR doesn’t protect against everything and becomes ineffective after a few washes. Anything oil-based will cause stains: oil, grease, ketchup, sriracha and most sauces. We believe there is a better solution.</p>

<p>Sweat and moisture can always be an issue, whether you are hiking the trails or in a hot sticky jungles of Cambodia, no matter what you are doing we made sure this material is moisture-wicking, breathable, and quick-drying. Our moisture control technology absorbs and moves moisture away from the body, which ensures faster drying times over cotton and providing exceptional comfort.</p>

<p>Our goal is to design these pants so they can pack as light as possible. Belts can take up a ton of space, so we designed these to give you the choice to wear a belt or not. Thanks to the magnetic button the front looks clean with no conventional button showing and looking like an eyesore. However sometimes you need to make sure your pants won’t fall down. We added a drawstring on the inside of the pants that can be used if needed, but not be seen to keep these looking sharp.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, these threads won’t expose you unintentionally... We’ve also hidden a drawstring on the inside of the waist if you need to secure these better for any reason.</p>

<p>Just in case a magnetic button and 4-way stretch material wasn’t comfortable enough, we gusseted the crotch to get rid of any bunching and pinching when sitting down. These are designed to be as comfy as sweat pants.</p>

<p>We wanted to remove the gimmicky and clunky features most hiking pants offer, but we still have some quality in the details that adds benefits.

<p>Hey, my name is Chris Loizeaux… I was born in Chattanooga, TN and after 15 years of living all over the US, I made my way back to Chattanooga in 2000. I grew up on road trips, camping/backpacking, skateboarding &amp; skin diving in the FL Keys. </p>
<p>I’ve spent the better part of the past 18 years as a designer &amp; creative director for companies and in early 2015, I accidentally started a fly fishing shop here in Chattanooga, which I ran for almost 4 years of good times… Towards the end of 2018 we closed down due to some “unforeseen circumstances”, but that gave me a chance to get back to my passion of design and product development. I’ve been fortunate to explore 45 out of the 50 states and fly fish on some amazing water, with even more amazing people… </p>
<p>As the product curator for my retail shop, I’ve been searching for the perfect pant for myself and my customers, and when it comes to the ones on the market, I’ve seen them all... but I’d yet to see the pair of pants that I actually wanted, until I drew them on a sketch pad with my business partner, Nick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561042399/mcuai3j1ef26u6zjlgcn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Nick Rader and I love to travel, backpack and do adventure sports.  I also love buying camping gear and researching what to buy and geeking out on all the specs before trying to find the perfect piece of gear.</p>
<p>My first trip out of the country unsupervised was right out of high school to go snowboarding in Switzerland.  Ever since then I’ve been hooked and go as much as I can.  So far I’ve been lucky enough to bum around the world a few times and to date have been to 62 Countries, even North Korea.</p>
<p>In 2011 I spent 6 months driving a motorcycle from South Africa to Norway and only had 1 pair of pants.  I also had one pair of underwear, but we don’t need to get into that.  I had 62 liters worth of space and had to carry camping equipment, plus tools and spare parts for the bike.  Needless to say I didn’t get to pack lots of clothes. During that trip I pretty much had on outfit that had to be able to do everything.  It had to handle 100+ degree head, and freezing temperatures.  It had to be able to climb kilimanjaro and look awesome cutting a sick rug at the club.  The clothes I took on that trip fell short on all accounts, they were ugly as sin and not even that good from a technical aspect.</p>
<p>Years later I did another 6 month trip on that motorcycle with my wife in eastern Europe and the Balkans.  I did a better job packing for that one, but I still couldn't get a pair of pants or shorts that really did a great job looking good, keeping my essentials secure and being super comfortable.</p>
<p>However it did get me thinking that there are no good adventure travel pants on the market and someone needs to make them.  So why not us.</p> <p>How it Started</p>
<p>The two of us met like most people do, completely by accident and randomness. Chris agreed to do a joint venture with a motorcycle magazine to do a fly fishing tour showing off his stores fly fishing excursions. Four guys were on the motorcycle tour and Nick happened to one of those guys who was tagging along because they had an extra bike since the leader of the magazine tour was his friend.</p>
<p>What was suppose to be a week of riding motorcycles and fly fishing turned into a week of drinking beers in a cabin while it rained cats and dogs all day everyday. It turns out that was the best possible outcome. After a few days of drinking beer and talking about random stuff, we started talking about gear and ended up sketching up a pair of shorts that we thought would be perfect for adventure and traveling.</p>
<p>When we got back from the trip we hit the ground running, and Trekka was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561042464/ixbyphc48oxohjnptixu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We’ve been in contact with our factory for the past 9 months of the development process &amp; they’ve done work for much larger brands than ours… We are confident in all the materials we’ve sourced, the factory’s quality of work and their production timeline, once we give them the go-ahead. The unknown is element in this process is if we experience any importing delays, though we’ve done our best to mitigate any foreseeable issues - from our EPA certification to our RN number, we’re legit!</p>

Sweat and moisture can always be an issue, whether you are hiking the trails or in a hot sticky jungles of Cambodia, no matter what you are doing we made sure this material is moisture-wicking, breathable, and quick-drying. Our moisture control technology absorbs and moves moisture away from the body, which ensures faster drying times over cotton and providing exceptional comfort.
 

Our goal is to design these pants so they can pack as light as possible. Belts can take up a ton of space, so we designed these to give you the choice to wear a belt or not. Thanks to the magnetic button the front looks clean with no conventional button showing and looking like an eyesore. However sometimes you need to make sure your pants won’t fall down. We added a drawstring on the inside of the pants that can be used if needed, but not be seen to keep these looking sharp.
Don’t worry, these threads won’t expose you unintentionally... We’ve also hidden a drawstring on the inside of the waist if you need to secure these better for any reason.
 


Just in case a magnetic button and 4-way stretch material wasn’t comfortable enough, we gusseted the crotch to get rid of any bunching and pinching when sitting down. These are designed to be as comfy as sweat pants.
 


We wanted to remove the gimmicky and clunky features most hiking pants offer, but we still have some quality in the details that adds benefits. This is why we added some silicon inside the waistband to help reduce any twisting or sagging throughout the day, as well as keep your shirt tucked in better if that is your style.
 

Hey, my name is Chris Loizeaux… I was born in Chattanooga, TN and after 15 years of living all over the US, I made my way back to Chattanooga in 2000. I grew up on road trips, camping/backpacking, skateboarding & skin diving in the FL Keys. 
I’ve spent the better part of the past 18 years as a designer & creative director for companies and in early 2015, I accidentally started a fly fishing shop here in Chattanooga, which I ran for almost 4 years of good times… Towards the end of 2018 we closed down due to some “unforeseen circumstances”, but that gave me a chance to get back to my passion of design and product development. I’ve been fortunate to explore 45 out of the 50 states and fly fish on some amazing water, with even more amazing people… 
As the product curator for my retail shop, I’ve been searching for the perfect pant for myself and my customers, and when it comes to the ones on the market, I’ve seen them all... but I’d yet to see the pair of pants that I actually wanted, until I drew them on a sketch pad with my business partner, Nick.
 

My name is Nick Rader and I love to travel, backpack and do adventure sports.  I also love buying camping gear and researching what to buy and geeking out on all the specs before trying to find the perfect piece of gear.
My first trip out of the country unsupervised was right out of high school to go snowboarding in Switzerland.  Ever since then I’ve been hooked and go as much as I can.  So far I’ve been lucky enough to bum around the world a few times and to date have been to 62 Countries, even North Korea.
In 2011 I spent 6 months driving a motorcycle from South Africa to Norway and only had 1 pair of pants.  I also had one pair of underwear, but we don’t need to get into that.  I had 62 liters worth of space and had to carry camping equipment, plus tools and spare parts for the bike.  Needless to say I didn’t get to pack lots of clothes. During that trip I pretty much had on outfit that had to be able to do everything.  It had to handle 100+ degree head, and freezing temperatures.  It had to be able to climb kilimanjaro and look awesome cutting a sick rug at the club.  The clothes I took on that trip fell short on all accounts, they were ugly as sin and not even that good from a technical aspect.
Years later I did another 6 month trip on that motorcycle with my wife in eastern Europe and the Balkans.  I did a better job packing for that one, but I still couldn't get a pair of pants or shorts that really did a great job looking good, keeping my essentials secure and being super comfortable.
However it did get me thinking that there are no good adventure travel pants on the market and someone needs to make them.  So why not us. How it Started
The two of us met like most people do, completely by accident and randomness. Chris agreed to do a joint venture with a motorcycle magazine to do a fly fishing tour showing off his stores fly fishing excursions. Four guys were on the motorcycle tour and Nick happened to one of those guys who was tagging along because they had an extra bike since the leader of the magazine tour was his friend.
What was suppose to be a week of riding motorcycles and fly fishing turned into a week of drinking beers in a cabin while it rained cats and dogs all day everyday. It turns out that was the best possible outcome. After a few days of drinking beer and talking about random stuff, we started talking about gear and ended up sketching up a pair of shorts that we thought would be perfect for adventure and traveling.
When we got back from the trip we hit the ground running, and Trekka was born.
 

Risks and challenges
We’ve been in contact with our factory for the past 9 months of the development process & they’ve done work for much larger brands than ours… We are confident in all the materials we’ve sourced, the factory’s quality of work and their production timeline, once we give them the go-ahead. The unknown is element in this process is if we experience any importing delays, though we’ve done our best to mitigate any foreseeable issues - from our EPA certification to our RN number, we’re legit!",29.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Update : We are now releasing new colored bracelets every 100 Facebook shares on our campaign (up to 1,000). These colors will be chooseable at the end of the campaign</p>
<p>Charging cables and having a sufficiently charged phone have become essential tools in our lives, this bracelet is the solution to forgetting your charger which leaves you without juice in your devices. Not only does it look great, it is always on hand (pardon the pun) to help you out with a reliable means of charging your phone. <strong>Available for all phone types, Micro-USB, iPhone and Type-c bracelets available</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Tech Brief</strong></h3>
<p>1. High strength, genuine leather cables with 18k gold plated ends</p>
<p>2. Quick charging which beats the original Apple cable. ( We have tested 1.6A with success ) while Micro-Usb we're also aiming for</p>
<p>3. All our products have lifetime warranty, you won't ever need to purchase another cable</p>
<p>4.One size fits most wrists</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Chargelet Bracelet</h3>
<p>A handy solution for charging your device on the go. You no longer have to worry about leaving your charging cable behind and running out of juice when you're in an emergency. </p>
<p>Wearable devices are increasingly used as tools designed to track your health, but a new entrant into the category has a far more practical mission: charging your devices.</p>
<p>The Chargelet bracelet charging cable might just look like a stylish piece of eye candy but it has a much more practical use. A water resistant bracelet which an onlooker won't realise isn't only a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>The product is self explanatory, it is easy to attach to your wrist with one hand and easy to undo, while offering protection to each end of the cable so it doesn't pick up damage over time, the gold plated ends are also scratch resistant.</p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p>We at MidasGold.com are a small startup in the fashion and jewelry industry, purveyors of unique designer gold jewelry and accessories. We specialize in sourcing the latest trends in urban fashions and street culture. Now we would like to add practicality to our range of jewelry.</p>
<p>Our latest product requires some more investment than we're used to, we'd love to be able to bring our product out to the masses but we have a slightly obstacle in the way of that, financing. </p>
<p>What separates us from other campaigns, we have the business experience meaning we already have factories, suppliers and other connections which we have had prior business with meaning there won't be any surprises or set backs, we have already created molds and samples for the products but we are here to fund the remaining costs of production, We have passed all the crucial steps in bringing this product to market such as industry design, engineering, product development and two rounds of prototyping to bring a flawless product to market.</p>
<p>The $5,000 will allow us to order a larger initial quantity which will bring the average price down for the customer, something that we'd have to charge the customer $60 we would be able to drop down to $35 which is much more reasonable.</p>

<h2>Collective Tee - the world's first wearable blog</h2>
<h3>Letting you spread the message and connect with those around you using the humble t-shirt.  </h3>
<h3>You choose how you spread and share the message behind each t-shirt. </h3>
<p>Collective Tee is a Melbourne based brand creating a unique way for you to connect with people around you using the humble t-shirt by creating the world's first wearable blog.  </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our aim is to create a unique garment that will enable our fans to become t-shirt bloggers and connect with those around them by </span>letting<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> them choose how they spread the message behind each t-shirt.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With the message printed on the inside and the graphic describing the message on the outside, you are free to share the printed message behind each t-shirt and connect with those around you.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Only you know the what's written so you choose what you share.<br/></span></p>
<h2>How is Collective Tee different: </h2>
<ul>
<li>We first start with a message for the blog post - not just any message, but a message which engages the listener and lends itself to being told time and time again. </li>
<li>We then get the blog post written by one of our talented writers.</li>
<li>We then send the blog post to an up and coming designer, who can be located anywhere around the world (read about our designers below).</li>
<li>The blog post becomes the inspiration for that designer to create a kick-arse design.</li>
<li>The blog post is printed on the inside of the back of the t-shirt (so only you, the wearer, know the message) and the graphic gets printed on the front of the t-shirt.</li>
<li>This simple process results in a t-shirt unique to Collective Tee. </li>
<li>The wearer wears their t-shirt, gets compliments, starts conversations about the message and connects with those around them. </li>
<li>As the message starts spreading you become part of the Tee Collective. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Issue 1 - YOLO - You Only Live Once</h3>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Issue 1 was designed by Italian designer Sasa Ciabatti (aka spazio C), an up and coming Italian graphic designer and artist with a keen eye for cool colour combinations and fun illustrations.  </p>
<p>This perk is available in Heather Grey and Arctic White and in a choice of t-shirts or tank top.  </p>

<h3>Issue 2 - Hollande's Timbuktu Tagine Tragedy</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/158010/files/20131027170338-Collective_Tee_final-167_as_Smart_Object-1_copy.jpg?1382918618"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Issue 2 was designed by Simon Greiner, an Australian designer originally from Sydney but now based in Brooklyn, New York.  We first noticed Simon when his design was on the front cover of the New Yorker.  That design won New Yorker's 2013 Eustace Tilley contest, where Eustace was depicted as an aloof Brooklyn hipster.  We are very excited to have worked so closely with Simon in creating Issue 2 for Collective Tee.  </p>
<p>This perk is available in Burgundy t-shirts. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Issue 3 - Nerd is the New Black</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/158016/files/20131027170943-Collective_Tee_final-213_as_Smart_Object-1_copy.jpg?1382918983"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Issue 3 is a collaboration between Collective Tee and New York illustrator and graphic designer David Olenick.  His work combines simple designs with a deadpan delivery.  His ingenious renderings of puns and character flaws give voice to cute critters and inanimate objects.  His designs have been produced by the likes of Threadless and GAP and now, Collective Tee. </p>
<p>We think that once you have read the story printed behind Issue 3 you will be as tickled as we are with David's work.  </p>
<p>This perk is available in Kelly Green and Bright Royal Blue t-shirts. </p>

Letting you spread the message and connect with those around you using the humble t-shirt.  
You choose how you spread and share the message behind each t-shirt. 
Collective Tee is a Melbourne based brand creating a unique way for you to connect with people around you using the humble t-shirt by creating the world's first wearable blog.  
Our aim is to create a unique garment that will enable our fans to become t-shirt bloggers and connect with those around them by letting them choose how they spread the message behind each t-shirt.  
With the message printed on the inside and the graphic describing the message on the outside, you are free to share the printed message behind each t-shirt and connect with those around you.  
Only you know the what's written so you choose what you share.
How is Collective Tee different: 

We first start with a message for the blog post - not just any message, but a message which engages the listener and lends itself to being told time and time again. 
We then get the blog post written by one of our talented writers.
We then send the blog post to an up and coming designer, who can be located anywhere around the world (read about our designers below).
The blog post becomes the inspiration for that designer to create a kick-arse design.
The blog post is printed on the inside of the back of the t-shirt (so only you, the wearer, know the message) and the graphic gets printed on the front of the t-shirt.
This simple process results in a t-shirt unique to Collective Tee. 
The wearer wears their t-shirt, gets compliments, starts conversations about the message and connects with those around them. 
As the message starts spreading you become part of the Tee Collective. 




More about Collective Tee

After this Indiegogo campaign Collective Tee will only be available on our website and even then only to subscribers. 
A new issue will be created every 6 weeks and sent to our subscribers in the mail. 
To ensure that our designs remain fresh, each issue will be designed by a different designer.
Our first few issues have been designed by designers in New York, Italy and Indonesia (read about some of designers below) and we have more designs from up and coming designers located in Australia, the UK and the rest of the world in the pipeline.  



Exclusive Indiegogo Offer
Issues 1, 2 and 3 will only be available exclusively as perks here on Indiegogo. 
Your contribution to Collective Tee will help us make Collective Tee a reality.  Your contribution will be used to: 

Enable us to find more exciting, fresh, up and coming designers from around the world.
Develop an awesome website which will enable us to connect you with other Collective Tee fans.
Produce more Collective Tees which are screen printed right here in Melbourne and help keep our local Melbourne businesses going.  


Issue 1 - YOLO - You Only Live Once





Issue 1 was designed by Italian designer Sasa Ciabatti (aka spazio C), an up and coming Italian graphic designer and artist with a keen eye for cool colour combinations and fun illustrations.  
This perk is available in Heather Grey and Arctic White and in a choice of t-shirts or tank top.  


Issue 2 - Hollande's Timbuktu Tagine Tragedy



Issue 2 was designed by Simon Greiner, an Australian designer originally from Sydney but now based in Brooklyn, New York.  We first noticed Simon when his design was on the front cover of the New Yorker.  That design won New Yorker's 2013 Eustace Tilley contest, where Eustace was depicted as an aloof Brooklyn hipster.  We are very excited to have worked so closely with Simon in creating Issue 2 for Collective Tee.  
This perk is available in Burgundy t-shirts. 

Issue 3 - Nerd is the New Black



Issue 3 is a collaboration between Collective Tee and New York illustrator and graphic designer David Olenick.  His work combines simple designs with a deadpan delivery.  His ingenious renderings of puns and character flaws give voice to cute critters and inanimate objects.  His designs have been produced by the likes of Threadless and GAP and now, Collective Tee. 
We think that once you have read the story printed behind Issue 3 you will be as tickled as we are with David's work.  
This perk is available in Kelly Green and Bright Royal Blue t-shirts.
