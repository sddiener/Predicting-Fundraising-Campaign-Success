<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<li>My name is James Kelly. I am a self-published author with two new books scheduled for release this year.

<li>Our goal is to offer a fun and informative show where authors and writers from every genre can showcase their work, while at the same time offer advice that is beneficial to up and coming writers. I created the show to discuss the various aspects of writing, publishing, and promotion methods that can often seem overwhelming to the novice writer.</li>
<li>Your donation will help to support the show while we create and grow this long-term project. Our monthly costs include advertising and promotion, plus web hosting and bandwidth for the broadcast. We have already created our own studio from which to record and broadcast the show.</li>

<li>We believe our goal of $1000 will position us for immediate success and sustainability while we seek corporate sponsorship.</li>
<li>We do not charge our guests to be on the show. Therefore, your contribution is greatly appreciated. Your contribution tells us that you truly believe in the validity and necessity of this broadcast.</li>

We are hoping to raise the funds necessary to take the show live on ROKU Television, Tunein Radio, and Livestream. As a member of amfm247.com the upgrade would be instant. VosCast, and hopefully 840 AM in Las Vegas are also a goal for the very near future. This would give us nationwide and worldwide coverage, reaching millions of listeners.</li>

My name is James Kelly. I am a self-published author with two new books scheduled for release this year. I previously hosted ""Aspects of Writing"" on KLAV 12.30 AM in Las Vegas, Nevada for three years. The network was purchased by a Lotus broadcasting in April 2015. Once the takeover was completed, KLAV flipped to a regional Mexican format as La Caliente.
Our goal is to offer a fun and informative show where authors and writers from every genre can showcase their work, while at the same time offer advice that is beneficial to up and coming writers. I created the show to discuss the various aspects of writing, publishing, and promotion methods that can often seem overwhelming to the novice writer.
Your donation will help to support the show while we create and grow this long-term project. Our monthly costs include advertising and promotion, plus web hosting and bandwidth for the broadcast. We have already created our own studio from which to record and broadcast the show.


What We Need & What You Get

We believe our goal of $1000 will position us for immediate success and sustainability while we seek corporate sponsorship.
We do not charge our guests to be on the show. Therefore, your contribution is greatly appreciated. Your contribution tells us that you truly believe in the validity and necessity of this broadcast.
Previously, I personally funded ""Aspects of Writing"" in its entirety. However, production cost, studio cost, advertising and promotion (social media) can become very expensive. This time it is my intention to launch the project with the ultimate goal of taking the show national. Recently we signed with amfm247.com, which broadcasts live on the worldwide web on Friday's at 6 PM (PST) and 9 PM (EST).

The Impact

Your contribution helps to maintain free advice for anyone contemplating writing, publishing, or marketing their work. Anyone who has published a book, written a play, or composed a piece of music, understands that the creation aspects of writing is a small percentage of what it takes to get your work before the public to enjoy. The hardest part begins after the work is completed.
I recall the fear I had when I created and produced ""Aspects of Writing"" for the first time. Three years later, I am constantly reminded of the success and true purpose of this venture when I see the pride in first time authors, who appeared on the show, having pursued and achieved their dream of becoming a published author. 
Every penny acquired will be used to enhance a fun, informative, encouraging and uplifting show that can change a writer from a dreamer to an achiever.


Risks & Challenges

There very little risk in putting this show together since we are already on the air. We just need to expand.
The biggest hurdle for me to overcome has been nerves. The first time on the air, I believe I hyperventilated. Thank goodness for the guests that night who pulled me through. I now treat the show as a living room.
I always tell my guests to just focus on the conversation, and that it is just us sitting around the room discussing our trials and tribulations – as well as our joys - about the writing industry. It really creates a fun, and sometimes funny atmosphere.

<h2>Give less f*cks, live more life</h2>
<p>Women not giving a f*ck means we decide what to care about. We decide what our priorities are. It means we can be mentally, spiritually, and emotionally free to live our lives as we choose. Women not giving a f*ck means we are unapologetic for being our bad-ass selves!</p>
<p>Since October 2017, I’ve taught over 700 women in the San Francisco Bay Area how to not give a f*ck. The impact has been incredible. The core teachings of my workshop help women to immediately implement strategies that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent Compassion Fatigue</li>
<li>Address Invisible Labor </li>
<li>Avoid Burnout in Their Profession</li>
<li>Reinforce the Right to Set Boundaries</li>
<li>Effectively Counter Gaslighting</li>
<li>Build Intersectional Solidarity</li>
</ul>
<p>This work changes women’s lives. It liberates. And it's too important to be limited to the women of the Bay Area. That's why I need your support to take this work worldwide.</p>
<p>As of April 5th, I am readjusting the funding goals to a more realistic sense of what my networks and community can handle. It was an edgy ask for me to begin with, and now I feel some ick for not staying with my gut.</p>
<p>If $8,000 is raised, I can keep working on the book and do a few out of area workshops.</p>
<p>If we can get to $10,000, parts of the workshop tour will happen! <br/>If we can get to $15,000 then I can start the podcast!<br/>If we can get to $20,000, I make the online courses and webinars!<br/>If we can get to $25,000 the whole workshop tour is ALIVE!</p>
<p>Learning in public is not an easy thing to do, but part of what I teach is to live our truths unapologetically and ask for support. I'm shifting on the fly and trying not to get stuck in the shame of publicly making a miscalculation. I went too big in my funding goal and now I'm course correcting.</p>
<p>I’ve been invited by 25 cities across North America to bring this powerful work to their communities. I'm developing a podcast, and a book proposal is also in the works, so this particular form of liberation can be accessed anywhere.</p>
<p>With everyone’s support, we can help reach women all over the world who want to be freed from the social conditioning—and the social conditions—that limit our power and efficacy. None of us can create change alone. Will you join me?</p>
<h3>Why Women Give a F*ck and Why it’s a Problem</h3>
<p>First, let me be clear—when I say that I work with women, I mean that I work with all women, including trans women, genderqueer, and non-binary femmes, and folks who are femme of center. The podcast, the book, and workshops rest on the concept of intersectional feminism. We can only be effective allies to one another by recognizing distinct barriers that certain groups of women face, and the right of all women to have access to their inner authority.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521081055/zncjppn2oct5leodntgo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>All women are constantly threatened by gender bias, sexual harassment, sexism, violence, and economic inequality. When we express dissatisfaction with the status quo, we're told that we have a personal issue—as if we’re responsible for harm being inflicted upon us. If we just cared a little more, if we were just a little more confident, if we were just a little more accommodating, none of these bad things would happen, right?</p>
<p>Hell no! Gender bias and discrimination are NOT the psychological problems of the women they oppress! Misogyny and sexual harassment are sociological phenomena, not psychological, and therefore require a sociological solution.</p>
<p>Please support this campaign, and please urge others to support it. Take a moment right now to choose and commit to a level of support, and then share it with your network. Then follow up with those people so that they get on board! This is too important to all of us to leave it to casual reminders. Make sure women know that we can free ourselves by saying no to trying to solve a sociological problem with a psychological response. Your donation will create a resource that women are asking for right now.</p>
<h3>Dismantling the Old Advice Models</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521153349/za3ny38tuhzvljydcqbv.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>A lot of the ""advice"" out there teaches women that ""empowerment"" is successfully getting along in a world designed to benefit men, to the disadvantage of women. It feeds on women feeling inadequate or like there's something wrong with them.</p>
<p><strong>How To Be A Woman &amp; NGAF says f*ck that!</strong></p>
<p>No more molding ourselves into the dysfunctional and limited roles expected of us. No more ""self-help"" that preys on women's vulnerabilities or capitalizes on unhealthy status quo boundaries.</p>
<p>My workshops help women learn to recognize how the forces of oppression constrain their choices in sometimes invisible ways—and then we help them exercise the power they already had to give the f*cks they want to be giving.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Media is an incredibly important platform for resistance. I'm committed to developing a podcast, a national workshop tour, a book and an interactive website to deliver this information to women who are ready to not give a f*ck—all to help women everywhere fully embrace that we don’t have to keep absorbing and internalizing these toxic societal messages and expectations. </p>
<p>Everyone needs access to media made by women who are giving less f*cks and as a result are living more life. We all benefit from stories that accurately reflect both the diversity of women’s experiences and the shared ground of misogyny and sexism.</p>
<p>If we're successful, it will mean that women can do less invisible labor.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521081926/josc5ezzi5vaqiq0v0qs.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Women will endure less gaslighting, be safer in the workplace, and it will mean that fewer people of all genders will put up with racist and sexist bullsh*t.</p>
<p>We start by not giving a f*ck about the status quo. There's no shame in acknowledging our limitations and using self acceptance to strengthen our resolve. Do this for you, be a woman who doesn’t give a f*ck.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Here's what this campaign is raising funds for:</h2>
<h3>THE WORKSHOP TOUR - $40,000, Summer - Fall 2018  </h3>
<p>North American tour. The workshops are  fully interactive, somatic, immersive experiences where women are able to really explore the f*cks they don’t want to give. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521093594/q5upmr4bfvfmankltt9d.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>In groups ranging from 12 to 40, women get to experience solidarity. We actively practice having each other’s backs. Everything we bring into the workshop is accounting for the differences that different women experience. In a white supremacist society, being explicitly anti-racist is the biggest f*ck you to the status quo.</p>
<p>So far, across North America women have asked me to bring this workshop to their communities. The invitation comes from feminist bookstores, community organizers, and moms offering to host the workshop in their living rooms.</p>
<p>Buy a VIP ticket to a How To Be A Woman &amp; NGAF Workshop in your city. Give a workshop ticket as a gift. Sponsor an entire workshop on behalf of other women. Don’t see your city? Message us!</p>
<h3>THE PODCAST - $5000</h3>
<p>From the very first workshop that filled up in minutes, women have been asking me “What’s your podcast? Where can I find your podcast?”<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521093810/sjtguekfvjlry332dbae.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>A very good question, because I didn’t (yet!) have one. That’s about to change. I’m partnering with a feminist, professional public radio producer to create a show that is informative, funny, engaging, and empowering—and that will help you learn how not to give a f*ck. We’ll be amplifying the diverse voices of incredible women who have rich stories to tell and meaningful insights to share. You will not want to miss a single episode. The ultimate goal is to monetize the show so that it become self-sustaining. But we need you to help us get the first season off the ground!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE WEBSITE - $35,000 Re-launching with online course offerings Fall 2018</h3>
<p>After the very first How to Be a Woman and NGAF workshop I realized how important this curriculum was and crossed my fingers that I could buy a domain that conveyed what was happening. I was shocked (shocked I tell you!) that <a href=""http://www.howtobeawomanandnotgiveafuck.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.howtobeawomanandnotgiveafuck.com</a> was available. I snatched it up and an online presence was born.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to move beyond presence to resource. The funds raised here will pay for a web developer and for the production of video courses and webinars. By Fall of 2018 we will be relaunching the website optimized for online coaching and learning with a community of contributing writers and more advanced versions of How to Be a Woman &amp; NGAF materials. The website will feature new writing and resources from many different women who don’t give a f*ck. Plus, a whole catalogue of interactive courses and webinars for everyone.</p>
<h3>THE BOOK - $20,000, Research and Development 2018 -19, Publication Summer 2019</h3>
<p>This is information every woman needs—and I want to share it in one of the most accessible formats. The book will be a resource that you can turn to again and again, and give as a gift to the women in your life who really need to give less f*cks. Solidarity means intersectionality. I will be interviewing women on the road to collect diverse stories of women learning how to not give a f*ck. This book is both a resource guide and a celebration. I’ll tell my own story, along with those of a dozen other women, about how not giving a f*ck about the status quo liberates and sustains us. This money will go towards both the time to write as well as the funds to hire an editor.</p>

<p>Airial Clark was raised by women who believe in women. As a single, Queer parent she's raised men who believe in women. She believes in you too. Her therapist is still amused that Airial teaches women how to not give a f*ck because, ""Airial you give so many f*cks about so many people!"" While this is true, Airial knows she can give the f*cks she gives because there are so many f*cks she's refusing. </p>

<p>Courtney King, founder and principal of C. King Solutions is a professional organizer with a cracked sense of humor, a cheerful disposition, and the determination to make things better. No worries, we can do this.</p>
<h3>We Have To Do This Together</h3>
<p>You are officially invited to join us in not giving a f*ck.</p>
<p>One of our favorite ways to express my f*cks is through where we direct our money. This is your opportunity to be a part of a movement.</p>
<p>Not automatically giving a f*ck means you are able to choose when you give f*cks and what f*cks you give. It means rejecting sexism. It means rejecting racism. It means we don't wear ourselves the f*ck out trying to please other people, including people who aren’t in our lives and people we don’t even know! We achieve balance. And we can’t do it alone.</p>
<p>Please support this campaign, and please urge others to support it.</p>
<p>You’re supporting media and community workshops created for women by women. Work that celebrates women being seen for who we really are and makes visible what we’re actually contending with. Do this for you.</p>

One of our favorite ways to express my f*cks is through where we direct our money. This is your opportunity to be a part of a movement.
Not automatically giving a f*ck means you are able to choose when you give f*cks and what f*cks you give. It means rejecting sexism. It means rejecting racism. It means we don't wear ourselves the f*ck out trying to please other people, including people who aren’t in our lives and people we don’t even know! We achieve balance. And we can’t do it alone.
Please support this campaign, and please urge others to support it.
You’re supporting media and community workshops created for women by women. Work that celebrates women being seen for who we really are and makes visible what we’re actually contending with. Do this for you.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Artificial</i> is a podcast about a human and a robot learning about the world. It follows the progression of a relationship between comedian Ana-Marija Stojic and her new  co-host, a real functioning Artificial Intelligence robot. The two work on building a podcast together by meeting up for coffee, having late night cram sessions and asking comedians and industry experts for their thoughts over burritos and binary.</p>
<p>This is a half documentary narrative half debate series that follows the relationship between a human and a robot: from their first meeting to their final day in studio as co-hosts when they find out that one of them might be replaced: will the studio execs replace the machine with another machine or the human with another human (or mix and match while they’re already at it)? <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.andthemachine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.andthemachine.com</a><br/> </p>

<h3><strong>What exactly is this project?</strong></h3>
<p>We love holding this podcast marathon!  It’s an all out celebration of podcasts and geekdom  which is a blast for fans and podcasters alike.  This year marks our third annual marathon and we hope to it make it the best one yet.  Both previous marathons played to packed houses and featured 20+ podcasts and acts performing live at the Blue Box Café in Elgin, IL.  In 2016 we added on online element and streamed the event on YouTube live. We also had a live concurrent marathon on our YouTube channel featuring even more podcasts that couldn’t make it to Elgin.  As soon as the event ended attendees and participants alike started asking us when the next one will be.  We now have an answer: October 7, 2017.</p>
<p>Even though the marathon is free to attend, there are costs involved and we need help.  This year we are hiring a popular artist to create the poster.  The artist and the printing of the posters cost money.  Flyers and press kits cost money.  We would love to hire PR to help us spread the word.  This costs money as well.  This is why we are holding this IndieGogo.  We need funds to spread the word and make this the best experience yet. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<strong>When is it?</strong> </h3>
<p>Oct 7, 2017 8:00am to 9:00pm CST. These times apply to the event at the Blue Box Café and to the streaming marathon that will be on YouTube Live.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We’re a diverse group of podcasters and content creators that want nothing more than to entertain and connect with fans. Some of the media groups involved are Golden Spiral, Too Much Scrolling, League of Geekz, as well as a number of independent shows and artists. Rob Southgate and Martha Southgate, co-owners and executive producers of Southgate Media Group, are producing this event. Together, they have also produced and performed live podcasts at the Blue Box for the past three and a half years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why an Indiegogo Campaign?</h3>
<p>Your support will give us the funds to promote the event including, T-Shirts, posters, flyers, PR and more.  If we go over this amount we have 4 stretch goals to get us two GoPros, a lighting package, and wireless mics to improve the quality of our streaming video. Your help allows us to produce a more professional event. </p>

<h3><strong>How else can you help?</strong></h3>
<p>Spread the word. Share this campaign. Tell your friends, co-workers, families, really anyone who loves podcasts or wants to support experimental forms of entertainment. Share this on social media or get a bullhorn and stand on a corner. </p>
<p>Thanks for supporting us!</p>

<h3><b><i>What's up,  Beloveds!</i></b></h3>
<p><b><i>I'm Jae Tafari from Kansas City, and we are now relocated in the beautiful state of Colorado! </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I am a first-generation Jamaican American multicultural performing activist, producer, writer, mother and spiritual partner.  </i></b><b><i>I'm also a survivor of childhood trauma. </i></b><strong><i>It took me 20 years to discover the many wounds that never healed, and I had extreme depression/</i></strong><strong><i>anxiety to prove it. I believe this is a byproduct of the miseducation of conscious love. </i></strong></p>
<p>Did you know that according to the American Psychological Association, 50% of Americans will encounter at least one traumatic experience in their lifetime. 8% of them will experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and women are twice as likely to develop PTSD (<a href=""http://www.apa.org/advocacy/interpersonal-violence/women-trauma.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.apa.org/advocacy/interpersonal-viole...</a>).</p>
<p>The Journal of National Medical Association reported that out of 617 patients who sought medical treatment for trauma, 96% of them were African American and 65% of them reported that they'd been through at least one traumatic experience. When searching for treatment, an article from the Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology considered  it more likely for Black Americans to drop out of treatment pre-maturely if they: A) met with someone outside of their race, B) felt disrespected or misunderstood, C) couldn’t afford the expenses.</p>
<p>        ""USA Today"" released an article in February of this year that out of 843 surveys, 94% of women in the entertainment industry stated that they were sexually harassed or witnessed harassment to their female colleagues. 65% admitted to never vocalizing their co-workers’ advancement due to sexual acts, and 21% were forced to perform sexual activities (<a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/02/20/how-common-sexual-misconduct-hollywood/1083964001/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018...</a>).</p>
<p>        When you look at the trauma in our world, Who gets the chance to speak up about it, let alone heal from it? Not many. Especially not women.</p>
<p><strong><i>So on August 31, 2018 “indiFEM.Dialogues w/ Sisters of Culture, Healing &amp; FAME”  is coming right into your comfy homes! </i></strong><strong><i> </i></strong></p>
<p><b><i>With your support, we can finally give voice to our stories, celebrate our experiences and treat ourselves to the remedies of quality living! </i></b></p>

<h2>Our Team</h2>
<p><i><strong>We’re a family of love warriors, and we believe in the power of collective conscious creativity.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>I’m the Producer/Host/Content Creator/Interviewer/Bookings Director/Editor/Media Manager and Founder of the show, but I can’t do it </strong></i><i><strong>alone. With the guidance of the Harmonious Eternal Loving Presence (HELP), my mentor and the founder of Females of Arts, Music &amp; Entertainment (F.A.M.E.) - Roz, and the sisters of culture &amp; healing, (Lisa Lola Healing Arts), (Yoga w/ Kiara), (Nettle+Honey), (iNity Home Health), we are blessed w/ the wisdom &amp; strength to heal the heart of a woman &amp; the soul of mankind.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Many of you know that I'm a full-time mother, and the last thing I want is to spread myself so thin, that I produce low quality work - all around the board. I want to be present and fun with Indigo, not drained or cranky. I want to excel in my Bliss Work, not half-ass my way through this amazing life experience. </strong></i></p>
<p><b><i>With the funding for ""indiFEM.Dialogues"" I have the chance to join forces with the top leaders, healers, and teachers to raise the level of consciousness across our communities and improve the statistics shown above.</i></b></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><i>As a mixed woman, a mother, an artist and a survivor of trauma, this platform is HUGE! I have spent my entire life looking for a place to not just fit in, but to actually belong. I've made so many mistakes and needed some safe, non-judgmental comfort. I've been confused and ashamed most of my life and never spoke up about it; let alone heard another story like mine. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Once I finally gave my story a chance - 6 years ago - I knew I had begun my healing journey. This soul cleansing journey has lead me out of some of the darkest hours of my life that allowed me to understand, re-direct and forgive. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>All I hope for is the chance to offer this same journey to you. No matter your race, gender, occupation or experience, you belong here, and your story matters. </i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong><i>No journey is perfect. Our dreams don't always come true exactly as we envision, but that doesn't mean it's not part of the Divine Agenda.</i></strong></p>
<p><b><i>""indiFEM.Dialogues"" is an investment in our future. We may not see everlasting results immediately, or perhaps in our lifetime. </i></b></p>
<p><i>""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" -Nelson Henderson</i></p>
<p><strong><i>I am a believer and a love warrior - as Glennon Doyle Melton so beautifully phrases. I trust in the Divine Agenda, for it has proven to me time and time again that all good things are made possible.</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Nelson Mandela says, ""It always seems impossible until it's done.""</i></p>
<p><i><strong>We may encounter some resistance from people who do not understand the value in this movement. Not everyone has the courage to step into vulnerability, and not everyone wants to transform. There are risks to every choice we make, but to take risks is to live freely, fully and deeply. </strong></i></p>
<p><i>""Seek patience and passion in equal amounts. Patience alone will not build the temple. Passion alone will destroy its walls."" -Maya Angelou</i></p>
<p><b><i>This is the beginning of something great! Each day a new seed will be planted. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>My mission is to use my gifts to heal the heart of a woman and the soul of mankind; starting within, one step at a time. </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Thy will be done.</i></b></p>

Our Team
We’re a family of love warriors, and we believe in the power of collective conscious creativity.
I’m the Producer/Host/Content Creator/Interviewer/Bookings Director/Editor/Media Manager and Founder of the show, but I can’t do it alone. With the guidance of the Harmonious Eternal Loving Presence (HELP), my mentor and the founder of Females of Arts, Music & Entertainment (F.A.M.E.) - Roz, and the sisters of culture & healing, (Lisa Lola Healing Arts), (Yoga w/ Kiara), (Nettle+Honey), (iNity Home Health), we are blessed w/ the wisdom & strength to heal the heart of a woman & the soul of mankind.
Many of you know that I'm a full-time mother, and the last thing I want is to spread myself so thin, that I produce low quality work - all around the board. I want to be present and fun with Indigo, not drained or cranky. I want to excel in my Bliss Work, not half-ass my way through this amazing life experience. 
With the funding for ""indiFEM.Dialogues"" I have the chance to join forces with the top leaders, healers, and teachers to raise the level of consciousness across our communities and improve the statistics shown above.
Please, help us give this platform for our sisters of culture, healing & FAME the exposure it deserves!

Even if we don't hit our entire goal, the show must go on!  We'll use every penny to give you the kind of show that we've been waiting for: REAL CONVERSATIONS WITH REAL WOMEN WHO ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THIS WORLD!

The Impact
As a mixed woman, a mother, an artist and a survivor of trauma, this platform is HUGE! I have spent my entire life looking for a place to not just fit in, but to actually belong. I've made so many mistakes and needed some safe, non-judgmental comfort. I've been confused and ashamed most of my life and never spoke up about it; let alone heard another story like mine. 
Once I finally gave my story a chance - 6 years ago - I knew I had begun my healing journey. This soul cleansing journey has lead me out of some of the darkest hours of my life that allowed me to understand, re-direct and forgive. 
All I hope for is the chance to offer this same journey to you. No matter your race, gender, occupation or experience, you belong here, and your story matters. 

Risks & Challenges
No journey is perfect. Our dreams don't always come true exactly as we envision, but that doesn't mean it's not part of the Divine Agenda.
""indiFEM.Dialogues"" is an investment in our future. We may not see everlasting results immediately, or perhaps in our lifetime. 
""The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."" -Nelson Henderson
I am a believer and a love warrior - as Glennon Doyle Melton so beautifully phrases. I trust in the Divine Agenda, for it has proven to me time and time again that all good things are made possible.
Nelson Mandela says, ""It always seems impossible until it's done.""
We may encounter some resistance from people who do not understand the value in this movement. Not everyone has the courage to step into vulnerability, and not everyone wants to transform. There are risks to every choice we make, but to take risks is to live freely, fully and deeply. 
""Seek patience and passion in equal amounts. Patience alone will not build the temple. Passion alone will destroy its walls."" -Maya Angelou
This is the beginning of something great! Each day a new seed will be planted. 
My mission is to use my gifts to heal the heart of a woman and the soul of mankind; starting within, one step at a time. 
Thy will be done.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Please, get the word out and make some noise about ""indiFEM.Dialogues""!
Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools on all of your social media, and let's give our sisters of culture, healing & FAME their voices back!
And that's all there is to it. ""It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a globe to transform a generation.

<p>THE ORIGIN</p>
<p>Melanated People came into existence in August of 2016. It spawned from the constant oppression of Black voices on white owned social media platforms. The need for a safe Black space was more prevalent than ever. Social networks have become a very intricate part of our everyday lives, and an important source of information, culture, and business. </p>
<p>After seeing positive, uplifting, thought provoking Black focused content being removed based on unfair bias rules and regulation on platforms that were supposed to encourage freedom of expression. The ability to amplify Black social and political issues within our communities is of the upmost importance, and bringing them to the light of the world is crucial. This was recently evident again in 2020, when the killing of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, by a White Minneapolis police officer resulted in widespread protests that demonstrated, where content such as post, and videos were removed from those main platforms. </p>
<p>""In 2021, social media advertising spending in the United States was projected to amount to 47.9 billion U.S. dollars, out of over 198 billion total online media advertising spending forecast for that year.""</p>
<p>Source:  Statista Research Department, Social media ad spend in the U.S. 2019-2021 </p>
<p>Not only are our voices silenced on major platforms, but our businesses are also hidden and shadow banned when they start to receive too much attention or tracking. Practices like these leads to the loss of small businesses and organizations that support our communities due to the lack of exposure. A report by the Institute for Policy Studies stated “While households of color are projected to reach majority status by 2043, if the racial wealth divide is left unaddressed, median Black household wealth is on a path to hit zero by 2053 and median Latino household wealth is projected to hit zero twenty years later. In sharp contrast, median White household wealth would climb to $137,000 by 2053.”  To counter act these predictions and maintain Black wealth, the first and most important action is to take back our narrative.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To have a truly safe space, Black people must create them for themselves, and they must be funded and supported by Black people.  We must make strides to close the technology gap and take our fair share in a Market that targets and profits from Black culture. This starts with simply controlling the places that our content created and stored.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“To date, we’ve connected over 100,000 users to Black content, groups, and businesses, that matters to them from all over the world.”  </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>Melanated People takes the power of social media and places it back into the hands of the culture.  It provides a platform for them to get involved with issues they care about or finding like-minded people without the fear of accounts being shadow banned or delete. Our users enjoy a public and private time, direct messaging, Live video, Groups as well as a directory of Black Owned services and business to make it simple to discover, find, and support. We also boast in app and website advertising so Black businesses and organizations can get the exposure they need and deserve. So far, we’ve connected over 100,000 users to Black content, groups, and businesses, that matters to them from all over the world.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>The Mission  </p>
<p>Our mission is to provide a Safe Space for all people of the global African diaspora, a platform to network, connect and build their brands and businesses. We seek to empower our members collectively by means of reinvestment into our communities; social, economic and education systems. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Black social media is the soul of the internet. Black Creators are the heart of the culture. Our content is unique and special. Melanated People was created because of the need to for Black people to control our own media, our own narrative. We want all people of the African diaspora to join and share our culture globally. We hope our app will unite our people worldwide and give us a platform to freely be us and enjoy who we are. To elevate who we are we need to have a safe black space where we can control how we spend our money, the products we support and reinvest into who we are.    </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> THE GOAL</p>
<p>Our next stage of evolution will focus on building our infrastructure to house more users, buy adding stronger servers and redesigning our apps for a more better user experience. We are working to make Melanated People the social media experience for the African diaspora. We are also looking to add additional features to better compete with mainstream platforms. It will also be used to create content and hire Black content creators, so we can develop better content for our users. We are ready to move to the next stage, but we need your help to do it.  We want to build a true community for our members to connect with each other, Black Businesses, and information that will help them grow.</p>

<h3>
<i>VALENCE</i> and the world of New Candler.</h3>
<p><i>VALENCE</i> is a serialized urban fantasy podcast, meant for adult audiences, entering its second season. In our first season, we introduced the major characters and learned a little about New Candler and the world in which the series takes place. With season two, we're bringing some new players to the game and taking our audience beyond what's already known and diving deeper into Halo, the tech company leading the market in magic suppression.</p>
<p>Season 2 of VALENCE is already in production, with all episodes written and edited, and with recording already underway! Join us on January 9th, 2021 for the Season 2 premiere of <i>VALENCE</i> wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<h3>How are we using your money?</h3>
<p>This season, we've budgeted to pay every actor who's working on the show -- this means that everyone involved in the voice acting portion is being paid, even if they only have a couple lines.</p>
<p>So here's the breakdown of our $7,000 goal:</p>
<p><strong>Voice Acting - $3,735.00</strong><br/>This is the actual cost of our voice acting this season! Because the scripts are completed, we know the exact cost. </p>
<p><strong>Sound Design - $2,400.00</strong><br/>Sound design is time consuming, so we want to make sure our sound designer (Wil) is paid for their work!</p>
<p><strong>Composition - $100.00</strong><br/><u><a href=""https://twitter.com/rowdyvega"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raul Vega</a></u> (creator of <i>Rose Drive</i> and <i>Swiss and Lali</i>) is coming back to create a version of the theme song for season 2 and must be paid for his work!</p>
<p><strong>Hosting Costs - $65.00</strong><br/>This will helpcover our website and RSS hosting costs for the season!</p>
<p><strong>Platform Fees - $700.00</strong><br/>Indiegogo charges a 5% platform fee, as well as a credit card charging fee on each payment. This is an estimate of what it will end up being. (And if those costs end up being less, it'll go towards hosting!)<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598658308/jbkwrknnqsjikbzo6xs8.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3>But what if we raise all of that?</h3>
<p>Once we hit our goal of $7,000, we've got some very exciting stretch goals in store!</p>
<p><strong>$10,000 - Bonus Episode: Nico's Perspective</strong><br/>That's right! If we hit the magic $10k number, we'll produce an episode from Nico's perspective  so everyone can learn more about our disaster chaos child.</p>
<p><strong>$15,000 - Bonus Episode: Morgan Reilley's Perspective</strong><br/>Season 2 is going to take us further into the depths of Halo -- but what about the side of the company that Liam and the TEAm <i>don't</i> see? $15k will get everyone an episode from the point of view of the CEO of Halo herself... Morgan Reilley.</p>
<p><strong>$20,000 - Bonus Episode: T.B.A.</strong><br/>Okay, listen... if we hit $20k, we'll do another bonus episode and let everyone decide what it is, We'll come up with some options and do a vote on what we do!<br/> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We at Hug House Productions are committed to making Season 2 of <i>VALENCE</i> a reality, so there's little risk to be had. The season is already written, edited, and currently in the recording stage of production, with sound design planned to begin in October 2020. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, <i>VALENCE</i> Season 2 will still happen, and we'll still be fulfilling your rewards — it just might take a bit longer to achieve, and won't have as many frills on the production. </p>

<h3>Background and Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! I'm Heather, and since 2009 I have been podcasting on Tudor England with my show, the Renaissance English History Podcast. In addition I created the first ever online virtual summit on Tudor history, the Tudor Summit, which brings together leading authors and historians to discuss Tudor history every six months. I also have a radio show on Tudor music in the UK. That show actually sparked the idea of creating an entire online radio station devoted to Tudor history. I wanted a way to distribute the show to my podcast audience, and since I don't have a radio license, I wouldn't have been able to do that on my show - the laws say that without a license you can only play 30 second snippets of music, covered under Fair Use. If you want to play full works (which I do on my radio show) you need a license.</p>
<p>The idea to get a license snowballed, and I've decided to start an internet station devoted to Tudor history. I'm gathering content from the leading podcasters out there, and I'll also be playing music from the 16th century. We'll have book shows, interviews, and more. </p>
<p>Basically, it will be an online station available through Tune In and its own player, and it will be focused on All Tudor, All the Time. Bringing you into the 16th century, no matter where you are. Whether it's in your car during your commute, at the gym, or when you're cooking dinner, you'll be guaranteed to turn on this station and hear something Tudor related - whether it's music or talk. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need some funding to make this station a reality! The first thing is the licensing, so we're legal to play all the music we want.

<p>I'm doing flexible funding with this, and everything you contribute will go straight to the campaign, even if I don't reach the final amount. This is something I'm going to do regardless, and I've created some (what I think are) great rewards and sweeteners to ask for your support. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe deeply in my bones that learning about history connects us to different cultures, and helps us see different viewpoints - something that has often become missing in modern discourse. I also think that the stories of this time period are just plain fun. </p>
<p>I've been talking about history, and sharing stories with people since I was 14 years old, and my first summer job was as a student docent at a Revolutionary War home in my hometown.

<p>The Tudor Radio Network will bring together presenters and experiences to connect you to the 16th century, to challenge your mind and help you see the world through the eyes of the people who lived five hundred years ago. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is going to be finding programming to fill 24 hours a day. My goal initially is to only fill up the day with 8 hours of programming which I would repeat three times - that's so that people in each time zone around the world would be able to catch the shows (there seems to be pockets of Tudor fans in Australia, Europe, and America, so broadcasting three times throughout the day ensures everyone will be able to listen to everything).</p>
<p>Part of the money raised from this indiegogo will go towards developing more original programming, and paying people to present shows.</p>
<p>I will say that I am uniquely positioned to be able to pull this off because of having been in the podcasting world for so long (9 years), being part of a podcasting network (the Agora Podcast Network where I have access to brilliant content creators), and the people I know through doing my Tudor Summits, and being deeply involved in this world. </p>

<p>Even if you can't help financially, I'd LOVE for you to share this with all your Tudor-loving friends! You can also listen like crazy once the station is live! We will need listeners to help us pull this off!!</p>
</div></div>","Background and Summary
Hey there! I'm Heather, and since 2009 I have been podcasting on Tudor England with my show, the Renaissance English History Podcast. In addition I created the first ever online virtual summit on Tudor history, the Tudor Summit, which brings together leading authors and historians to discuss Tudor history every six months. I also have a radio show on Tudor music in the UK. That show actually sparked the idea of creating an entire online radio station devoted to Tudor history. I wanted a way to distribute the show to my podcast audience, and since I don't have a radio license, I wouldn't have been able to do that on my show - the laws say that without a license you can only play 30 second snippets of music, covered under Fair Use. If you want to play full works (which I do on my radio show) you need a license.
The idea to get a license snowballed, and I've decided to start an internet station devoted to Tudor history. I'm gathering content from the leading podcasters out there, and I'll also be playing music from the 16th century. We'll have book shows, interviews, and more. 
Basically, it will be an online station available through Tune In and its own player, and it will be focused on All Tudor, All the Time. Bringing you into the 16th century, no matter where you are. Whether it's in your car during your commute, at the gym, or when you're cooking dinner, you'll be guaranteed to turn on this station and hear something Tudor related - whether it's music or talk. 

What We Need & What You Get
I need some funding to make this station a reality! The first thing is the licensing, so we're legal to play all the music we want. Also, the radio station software, and web space, so we can broadcast out all over the Tudor-loving world! Then, money for licensing and paying for content from other shows and presenters. 
I'm doing flexible funding with this, and everything you contribute will go straight to the campaign, even if I don't reach the final amount. This is something I'm going to do regardless, and I've created some (what I think are) great rewards and sweeteners to ask for your support. 

The Impact
I believe deeply in my bones that learning about history connects us to different cultures, and helps us see different viewpoints - something that has often become missing in modern discourse. I also think that the stories of this time period are just plain fun. 
I've been talking about history, and sharing stories with people since I was 14 years old, and my first summer job was as a student docent at a Revolutionary War home in my hometown. I can remember so vividly the experience of being in the home alone, looking at the possessions of the family that had lived there, and thinking how very close we were - only time had separated us. When you can cross time, and start to see the world through the eyes of the people who lived those events, you start to build empathy, and it becomes easier in general to see the world through the lens of people who might view it differently than you do. 
The Tudor Radio Network will bring together presenters and experiences to connect you to the 16th century, to challenge your mind and help you see the world through the eyes of the people who lived five hundred years ago. 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is going to be finding programming to fill 24 hours a day. My goal initially is to only fill up the day with 8 hours of programming which I would repeat three times - that's so that people in each time zone around the world would be able to catch the shows (there seems to be pockets of Tudor fans in Australia, Europe, and America, so broadcasting three times throughout the day ensures everyone will be able to listen to everything).
Part of the money raised from this indiegogo will go towards developing more original programming, and paying people to present shows.
I will say that I am uniquely positioned to be able to pull this off because of having been in the podcasting world for so long (9 years), being part of a podcasting network (the Agora Podcast Network where I have access to brilliant content creators), and the people I know through doing my Tudor Summits, and being deeply involved in this world.

<p>Okay, we're asking for financial help. We reckon this is a two, possibly three-year project, so we'll need to buy hosting if we're going to do it properly. We could do it all using freebies, but it might mean we run out of download capacity (episode 1 has almost crashed the free allowance), and we'd also struggle to host previous episodes (episode 1 took up 37%, so we'd struggle to host an archive of more than about three). We'd also have to lose the music, as you need to buy a PRS podcast licence in order to use it. (NB: The music choices will be goooooood!)</p>
<p>So if you fancy chucking a couple of quid our way to help out, we'd appreciate it. If you'd like to chuck a couple of quid more, we'd appreciate it even more. And if you'd like to sponsor the whole shebang, our appreciation would know no bounds. In return we'd offer rewards, as detailed opposite.</p>
<p>And finally, we've budgeted for more than we need, because it could well be that we don't get enough people chipping in. Which is fine. You ungrateful bleeders. However, if we do get fully funded, there will possibly be more money than we need. If so, we'll send the surplus County's way, in the form of sponsorship of some kind.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Cracked Brain!!! What started out as a weekend hobby podcast has grown so much over the last year. Cosplaying is a passion that all of us share; as a way to challenge ourselves to create and embody a character with our own hands and creativity. Now, we want to take our vision higher. Our goal with this campaign is to actualize dreams that we have all had since childhood.</p>
<p>Brandon and Candace went to school to attain degrees in animation and game design. After attaining those degrees, the market for those endeavors left our area. And for the last few years, those skills have remained fairly unused. Stephan has dreamed of being a professional voice actor since he was 5 years old. Although he has been able to do some voice acting work in the past, work is exceedingly hard to come by. So, instead of trying to look at others to POSSIBLY join, we want to create our own content to use the skills we've tirelessly worked to enhance. This campaign is will hopefully enable us to purchase the needed hardware and software to create the animated show, web comic, and other content that we want to create.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Your Rewards</h3>
<p>We've spent many hours figuring out what we will need in order to bring everyone the best content we can. Optimizing the computer set ups we already have and getting the equipment needed to bring our original ideas to light.</p>
<ul>
<li>We've calculated that the minimum to get the bare essentials of what we'll need will be around $5000. The low key home studio set up for audio production that we're planning to use, is about $2700 with the components alone (Condenser microphones, A quality mixer board, mics stands, sound insulation, etc). The rest is going toward getting the computer components needed to ensure quality animation production, 3D imaging, audio engineering, and more.</li>
<li>For the past few months, we have been looking for as many different ""rewards"" to offer, as possible. For all physical items, we've contacted local companies about a variety of different products. A goal of ours is to offer the most fun products that we can offer AND support local artists and companies at the same time.</li>
<li>If we are not successful in achieving our projected goal, we plan to use whatever donations received to purchase the necessary components that we will be able to use.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Another Way You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are tough for all of us. And sometimes we just don't have the funds available to help out monetarily. But there is another way that helps out JUST AS MUCH. Let as many people know about this campaign as possible. Talk about us with friends and family. Share it on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other social media platform. </p>

<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <strong>Lima</strong> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <b>Perú</b>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Lima</strong> en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>
<h3><strong>El reto</strong></h3>
<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso <strong>debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días</strong>. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.</p>
<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>
<p>Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.</p>
<p>Tal vez no vives en <strong>Lima</strong>, pero conoces a alguien que vive allá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.</p>
<p>Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.</p>
<p>Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.</p>
<p>¿Contamos contigo?</p>

Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Lima en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos perks para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).
Por qué te necesitamos
Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  
Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.
El reto
Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente después del 15 de Septiembre, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.
La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.
Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.
Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.
Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.
Tal vez no vives en Lima, pero conoces a alguien que vive allá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.
Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.
Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.
¿Contamos contigo?

Unpack all of the lies and stories that were told to you about Indigenous people and POC. </div><div> </div><div>Help us bring the truth of our voices and experiences and set the record straight for future generations.</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>The ""Why""</h3>
<p>We must know where we come from to know who we are.  We need to know the real history to form identities as Indigenous people and POC that are proud, loud and mad!</p>
<p>We need to undo the erasure of our people from history and media by beginning to tell our stories again.  The language that we speak and the stories that we tell were the first things that were stripped from our people as acts of oppression.  We were written out of history books, erased from the census and denied basic rights to gather in public, build community, and share our knowledge and culture.  Raices is working as a community group to build these experiences in person through programming that we offer around playgroups, language classes, herbal/healing workshops and other opportunities to bring the community together to share our stories and our wisdom.</p>
<p>Our podcast is an extension of our mission and will allow us to bring the stories and knowledge to a larger audience, including those who are unable to make our live events.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We aim to provide a bimonthly podcast to start as we launch with ""extras"" offered as we are able to develop them.</p>
<p>All contributers of $60 or more will be able to access our podcasts for as long as they desire.  We will be creating a virtual community of listeners on Patreon as a way to better interact with our listeners and share the stories of others.</p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need equipment and money for marketing.  In order to get the podcast up and running we need microphones, headphones and small equipment to get the podcast to sound great- especially when we record live events. </p>
<ul>
<li>We need $900 for equipment and marketing to start up our podcast to provide this information to the public.  We are hoping to make the content available in both English and Spanish.</li>
<li><p>For those who donate $60 or more and join our listening community, we will be able to give you a shout-out at the beginning of our episodes and the chance to get some ""Decolonize your Mind"" merch after we launch our podcast as a way to say ""Thank you!""</p></li>
<li>If we arent able to raise all of the money, we will use what we collect to buy whatever equipment we can afford and will continue fundraising to meet our goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Those who hold the information, drive the narrative.  It is time for a revolution of information. It is time to re-center the experiences and stories of people of color.  By embracing and learning our history we are acting in resistance to settler/colonialism. By sharing our stories and history that has tried to be erased, we are continuing the legacy and ensuring that future generations have access to this information.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our first podcast and so we anticipate the beginning to be a little rocky.  We know there will be a learning curve but we are quick learners and are committed to getting this done! </p>
<p>However, we have experience in writing, editing and storytelling.  We are avid readers and researchers and will take the time to make sure we get our facts right and our stories straight. </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>And Remember...</h3>
<p>We are resilient people because we have survived the gravest acts of genocide, violence, and oppression.  We are also beautiful people because we have rich cultures full of songs, stories, languages, cuisine, and wisdom that are complex and unique.  We would be honored to bring as much of this to you as we can so that you may learn and share with others.  Knowledge truly is power.</p>

<h3>TL;DR:</h3>
<p>We need more horror written by Black people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many podcasts/magazines don't pay their writers. That's not cool.</li>
<li>Very few podcasts/magazines pay pro rates. We get it. That's tough to do. That's why we need your help.</li>
<li>We want to increase the exposure Black horror writers get &amp; help them launch amazing careers</li>
<li>Podcasts are incredibly popular and an excellent avenue to promote authors and their stories</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you help us get more Black horror out into the world?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need You</h3>
<p>It's not cool to only ""pay"" writers with exposure. Writers have bills and we don't know anybody that accepts exposure as payment. We want to pay the writers whose stories appear in this podcast a fair rate. We also want to pay the Black narrators a fair wage for their voice performances. And people in Hell want ice water, but they can't launch crowdfunding campaigns, so we hope you can help our wants become reality.</p>
<p>Nightlight will (with your help) be a weekly podcast featuring a ~30 minute horror story written by a Black writer, along with a short interview with that author. The founder, Tonia Thompson, will edit and produce the podcast.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We need at least $5,000 to fund the first year.</strong> This will allow us to pay writers $75 per story and narrators $25. That's 52 stories, 52 writers, 52 episodes of horror. If we can't raise $5,000, we'll either produce fewer episodes or pay writers less. We'll decide exactly what will produced at the end of the campaign, with your input, if we raise less than $5,000.</li>
<li>
<strong>$15,000 means we can pay pro rates!</strong> This is important because paying a writer pro rates allows them to join the Horror Writer's Association, where they can enjoy a number of benefits including promotion of their work and career resources. The writers can also be nominated for awards, so we <i>really</i> want to be able to a pay pro rate of ~$270 per story.</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise more than $15,000,</strong> we will pay narrators more! At $15,000, we will be paying the narrators out of our own pockets, but with your help, we can pay narrators professional rates as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>You'll be helping us fund the first year, </strong>allowing us time to build an audience large enough to sell ad time, and perhaps even build a community of support via Patreon.</li>
<li><strong>If we raise a ridiculous amount of money, we'll use it to fund next year's episodes.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll help Black horror writers launch careers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Agents, directors and producers can find potential horror stories and writers in one place.</li>
<li>We'll lift the voices of marginalized writers and allow them to tell their stories.</li>
<li>Racism sucks. Hearing more stories from a Black perspective can help fix that.</li>
<li>Reparations!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>Your Bible pulsates with the kinetic energy of thousands of years, 66 books, 40 authors, 3 continents, 3 languages! It has space wizards, and dragons, and knights, and scientists, and detectives.

For as little as $1, hear it now! </strong></p><h2>About the Show</h2><p>Haven Otomo has a gift of persuasion. After surviving a brutal train massacre, she uses this gift to save people from the brink of suicide. She spends her free nights patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge, where over the past few years she has stopped 34 people from jumping. </p><p>To process her own trauma, Haven goes to a recovery group for survivors and performs as a stand-up comic as a form of therapy.</p><p>Two years after the train massacre, the area sees a rash of suicides. Young men are throwing themselves in front of trains. When the police find a connection to the train shooting two years ago, it leads them to Haven.</p><p>The police ask for her help in the investigation. As more is revealed about these crimes, Haven wonders whether some of her fellow survivors are involved, and she questions whether she can trust the people closest to her.</p><h2>Story Origins</h2><p>A few years ago, I read a story about a man named Chen Si, who has saved more than 300 people from jumping from the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China. I was immediately inspired by someone who would dedicate themselves to helping people in this way. The story also made me wonder what type of person would perform this kind of work, and the power of persuasion he would have to talk hundreds of people out of hurting themselves.</p><p>This was the seed that grew into The Patron Saint of Suicides. The main character, Haven Otomo, has dedicated herself to helping people in crisis. I wanted to create a character with a preternatural gift of persuasion and explore how this gift would impact other facets of her life. Then, I wanted to put her in a story where her gifts would be tested. I set the story in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge, the most popular location in the United States for suicide jumpers.</p><p>The central crime of the book, a train robbery that turns into a mass shooting, was inspired by the phenomenon of the “flash rob,” a new kind of crime that has emerged and grown in popularity over the past few years. The crime usually involves a group of minors meeting at a certain location, for example, a convenience store. They then swarm the store and steal everything in plain sight, fleeing the scene before the staff or owners can take action. A similar robbery recently occurred on the San Francisco Bay Area’s BART system. After interviewing several police officers on the nature of the crime, I thought it would be interesting to feature a crime that escalated out of control and resulted in tragedy.</p><h2>Timeliness and Relevance</h2><p>The New York Times reported a study from the National Institute for Health Statistics that suicide in the United States has surged to a 30-year high. The latest data show that more than 42,000 people died from suicide in 2014, compared to more than 29,000 in 1999. The rates have climbed for almost every demographic and age group. The World Health Organization estimates that roughly 800,000 people across the globe die from suicide each year.</p><p>Suicide is a growing concern, and yet, as a society, we have largely shied away from discussing it in a meaningful way. This audio drama should resonate with those looking for a springboard for discussion.</p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>We are looking to raise $5,000.00 USD to cover the costs of production. This will also pay for bonus content, and set the stage for us to develop a season 2! We worked really hard since the fall of 2019 to bring this show to life, and we're really proud of it. We hope you can help support this so we can produce more content and ignite a conversation about mental health in this country.</p><h2>20% of Proceeds Fund Mental Health Work</h2><p>Part of our goal in this show is to raise awareness and open discussion around mental health. To that end, we are committing 20% of the proceeds from this campaign to be donated to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (<a href=""http://www.nami.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nami.org</a>).</p><h2>What You Get</h2><p>We appreciate whatever support you can give, and we'll offer the following perks:</p><p><strong>FRIEND.</strong> For $1, you get:</p><ul>

Here are some blurbs from other authors about the novel version:</span></p><p><strong>""Some books grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until the last page is turned. THE PATRON SAINT OF SUICIDES is such a book. Gorgeously written and ingeniously plotted, it held me captive from its shocking start to its jaw-dropping conclusion.""</strong></p><p>— Riley Sager, bestselling author of <i>FINAL GIRLS</i></p><p><strong>“An emotional ride born from the ashes of a tragic robbery, Alex Dolan delivers a brilliant and complex thriller that will whisper to you long after you close the cover. You NEED this on your radar.”</strong></p><p>—J.D. Barker, International Bestselling Author of <i>Forsaken </i>and <i>The Fourth Monkey</i></p><p><strong>""A novel that subverts, very cleverly, the reader's expectations of where it will take them. I will be thinking about it for some time to come. Dolan is an unquestionably talented writer.""</strong></p><p>— Alex Marwood, bestselling author of <i>The Darkest Secret</i>, <i>The Wicked Girls</i>, and <i>The Killer Next Door</i></p><p><strong>“Alex Dolan possesses not only a fine talent for storytelling, but also a gift for creating intriguing, unusual characters to people and drive those stories. In The Patron Saint of Suicides, we meet Haven Otomo, a struggling stand-up comic who trolls the Golden Gate Bridge for possible suicides to coax off the rail. The prose is crystal clear and sinewy, scaffolded by a lively structure that dances from Haven’s first-person voice to an objective third-person narration featuring Gibson and Blossem. Dolan combines compelling, believable characters—Haven, in particular, is irresistible—with another dark, twisting tale that will keep you reading long into the night.”     </strong></p><p>—Randall Silvis, bestselling author of <i>Two Days Gone</i></p><p><strong>“The Patron Saint of Survivors is a beautifully-written and immersive story that tackles fairly harrowing topics in such a captivating and lyrical way, I found myself lost in the pages, unable to put it down. Haven, our main character, is probably one of the most likable and unique characters I've read in a long time, a pitch-perfect embodiment of the extremes explored in this novel, comedy and death, extremes balanced by a talented author to make for a wholly balanced and literary novel, with the added bonus of suspense. I greatly appreciate Dolan's giving pen, the details he provides, the colors, the play with senses, so that I was able to live in this gorgeous story.”</strong></p><p>—Shannon Kirk, award-winning author of <i>Method 15/33 </i>and <i>In the Vines</i></p><p><strong>“Alex Dolan’s THE PATRON SAINT OF SUICIDES is part mystery, part thriller, and wholly a dark and intricate study of human behavior. Dolan intersects comedy and tragedy with a masterful touch, resulting in a character-deep novel that contains as many moments of aching humanity as it does cliffhangers. One of the most original voices I’ve read in some time.”</strong></p><p>– Carter Wilson, USA Today bestselling author of <i>Mister Tender’s Girl</i> and <i>The Comfort of Black</i></p><p><strong>“Employing deft prose, Alex Dolan weaves a compelling tale that tackles PTSD, gun violence, and other societal ills while exploring how we use humor to process and deflect our pain. A wonderful read.”</strong></p><p>—Nina Sadowsky, bestselling author of <i>Just Fall</i> and <i>The Burial Society</i></p><p><strong>“The Patron Saint of Suicides is a complex exploration of loss and vengeance with a twist you’ll never see coming.”</strong></p><p>—Elizabeth Heiter, award-winning author of The Profiler series</p><p><strong> “It's not enough to say that THE PATRON SAINT OF SUICIDES is a gripping psychological drama.  It does more than grip.  It tears.  It horrifies.  It eviscerates.  Dolan has crafted a story that has as many layers as a fractured psyche--and as the plot unfolds, the layers peel back one after the other, always revealing new surprises.  The deeper you fall into the plot, the deeper you fall into madness--until the book's gut-wrenching and completely unexpected conclusion.  This novel is an amazing accomplishment.”</strong></p><p>—Joshua Gaylord (Alden Bell), acclaimed author of <i>When We Were Animals</i></p><p><strong>“The Patron Saint of Suicides grabbed me immediately. Dolan writes with an incredible confidence and clarity of voice, and he roots a weighty, thoughtful story in characters who feel like people you already know.” </strong><br/><br/>—Rob Hart, acclaimed author of <i>New Yorked </i>and <i>City of Rose</i></p></div>","The Patron Saint of SuicidesThe Patron Saint of Suicides will launch in August 2020 as a 14-episode podcast audio drama, created by author Alex Dolan. With a full cast of roughly 40 actors, an original score, and sophisticated sound design and foley effects, this is designed as a movie for your ears.UPDATE: As of July 13, we will be offering immediate access for all donors to the first episode! For as little as $1, hear it now! About the ShowHaven Otomo has a gift of persuasion. After surviving a brutal train massacre, she uses this gift to save people from the brink of suicide. She spends her free nights patrolling the Golden Gate Bridge, where over the past few years she has stopped 34 people from jumping. To process her own trauma, Haven goes to a recovery group for survivors and performs as a stand-up comic as a form of therapy.Two years after the train massacre, the area sees a rash of suicides. Young men are throwing themselves in front of trains. When the police find a connection to the train shooting two years ago, it leads them to Haven.The police ask for her help in the investigation. As more is revealed about these crimes, Haven wonders whether some of her fellow survivors are involved, and she questions whether she can trust the people closest to her.Story OriginsA few years ago, I read a story about a man named Chen Si, who has saved more than 300 people from jumping from the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge in China. I was immediately inspired by someone who would dedicate themselves to helping people in this way. The story also made me wonder what type of person would perform this kind of work, and the power of persuasion he would have to talk hundreds of people out of hurting themselves.This was the seed that grew into The Patron Saint of Suicides. The main character, Haven Otomo, has dedicated herself to helping people in crisis. I wanted to create a character with a preternatural gift of persuasion and explore how this gift would impact other facets of her life. Then, I wanted to put her in a story where her gifts would be tested. I set the story in San Francisco, near the Golden Gate Bridge, the most popular location in the United States for suicide jumpers.The central crime of the book, a train robbery that turns into a mass shooting, was inspired by the phenomenon of the “flash rob,” a new kind of crime that has emerged and grown in popularity over the past few years. The crime usually involves a group of minors meeting at a certain location, for example, a convenience store. They then swarm the store and steal everything in plain sight, fleeing the scene before the staff or owners can take action. A similar robbery recently occurred on the San Francisco Bay Area’s BART system. After interviewing several police officers on the nature of the crime, I thought it would be interesting to feature a crime that escalated out of control and resulted in tragedy.Timeliness and RelevanceThe New York Times reported a study from the National Institute for Health Statistics that suicide in the United States has surged to a 30-year high. The latest data show that more than 42,000 people died from suicide in 2014, compared to more than 29,000 in 1999. The rates have climbed for almost every demographic and age group. The World Health Organization estimates that roughly 800,000 people across the globe die from suicide each year.Suicide is a growing concern, and yet, as a society, we have largely shied away from discussing it in a meaningful way. This audio drama should resonate with those looking for a springboard for discussion.What We NeedWe are looking to raise $5,000.00 USD to cover the costs of production. This will also pay for bonus content, and set the stage for us to develop a season 2! We worked really hard since the fall of 2019 to bring this show to life, and we're really proud of it.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Fireside is a labor of love created by two people that love hearing new and different stories. Dyllan Becker is one of the writers and an executive producer of the show. He spent a lot of time in high school and college working both on and off the stage. He has been an actor as well as a set designer, stage hand, and sound technician for upwards of fifteen theatre productions. He has been writing for as long as he's been on the stage and this will be his debut as the head writer of a project of this calibre. He has been published in a short story anthology called ""From the Ashes, Rise (The Apocrypha Files),"" which can be found on Amazon. </p>
<p>Gaby Halligan is the co-producer and writer of Fireside, and is returning to the creative world after a long hiatus. Having experience in acting, singing, and directing, she is now having a blast with audio engineering and composing in the podcast world. She is an avid tea connoisseur and proud dog mom, and has dreams of one day moving to a cabin in a magical Canadian forest.  </p>
<p>Art and Graphic Design created by Anna Meyer. Anna can be found on Instagram @brusierkee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everyone says something to the effect of ""Create the art you want to see in the world"" and that's the idea behind Fireside. Fireside is the story of a member of a small town bringing a local radio tower back from the brink. It's filled with technical difficulties and crazy happenings in a town that focuses on high tech and future forward research. This is the first major project that this production team is embarking on and we want to start with a bang. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are allowing us to create a high quality show with paid actors and artists. You are also allowing us to have a quality website and marketing style that will allow us to get the show out as professionally and quickly as we can. The funds of this campaign will allow us to create a professional show and hopefully launch us into a position where we can go on to create an even better Season 2. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For Season 1 of Fireside we are looking to raise $1200. </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the funds: </p>
<p>Logo Design/Show Art: $200.00</p>
<p>Artists' work takes time and effort and we think they deserve to be paid for their work. This amount includes the logo you see on the front page of the campaign page as well as artwork for our forthcoming website.</p>
<p>Microphones: $250.00</p>
<p>Professional sounding shows use professional equipment! We are hoping to use this money to refund our already sunk cost for cheaper microphones and use the rest to provide better quality microphones for all recording characters. We want to bring you guys the best show possible and that involves getting great mics.</p>
<p>One year of RSS hosting: $60.00</p>
<p>RSS hosting is a fancy phrase for the place that stores the podcast episodes and disperses them to the various podcatchers like Stitcher, Spotify, iTunes, the Google Play Store, etc. We are ballparking this price so it will probably be more and we may need a more expensive package depending on how many downloads we get throughout the run of the show. </p>
<p>Actor Stipends: $250.00</p>
<p>Just like artists, actors need money, too! They can't all do their work for free or no one would ever go into acting again...or, maybe they would, but we think actors deserve money. This amount is also a ballpark but it will provide our main actors with about $15 per episode. More funds will most likely go their way, but we want to have a nice base to start with. </p>
<p>Website Domain and hosting: $150.00</p>
<p>These funds will be used to get us a good, succinct domain name as well as give us the server space to host our website. We will most likely be using a site like Squarespace that let's us do all of this at once, hopefully minimizing the costs on this front.</p>
<p>The rest of the money will be used for taxes and fees and anything that we haven't thought of yet. Any extra will likely go to our artists or our creative team so they can keep bringing Fireside to you!</p>
<p>All of our perks have been well thought out and we have made sure to provide new perks for each level up. We also wanted to make sure there was a wide variety of perks and things that directly related the show so that we can give back to the people who are going to make our show possible!</p>
<p>If we do not fund fully, we will reapportion the money that we get and continue with the project as planned. We may potentially try to crowdfund again and some of the perks may be delayed but we still plan on making the show no matter what the cost. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our work is incredibly inclusive and dynamic. The characters are fleshed out and diverse in every sense of the word. We are trying to add to the burgeoning art of audio drama podcasts and we are hoping to make  lasting impact on the art form and bring our story to any and all receptive ears. We have worked on creative projects since high school so now we're taking a stab at a podcast. Donations will help us bring our dreams to fruition so every little bit helps!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creativity is hard and time consuming. This work will take a lot of time in order for it to be the best product for you, the donors and the listeners. The production team works full time jobs and has to use their off time to live life and also produce a podcast. This is a very high priority, however. We have already written eight plus episodes of the show, which makes the time commitment less right off the bat. We are dedicated in creating the most amazing show we can. We won't stop until it's amazing. We are hard working, problem solving people who are determined to produce a show and put it out on time and you can hold us to that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>If you can't donate or you want to help some more, share our campaign with your friends and family any way you can! Send an email or link on Facebook or write the campaign URL on piece of paper and put it in a bottle and send it out into the ocean. If that doesn't sound appealing, be sure to follow us on Twitter (@Fireside_Radio) or find our Facebook page and give us a like. You can share both of those and get the word out on the show. Talk about the idea with friends and get them interested. Anything you can do to spread the word would be incredible and we would be forever thankful. Don't forget that IndieGoGo has an easy share tool to help you spread the word!</p></div>","Summary

<h3>4oG's Podcast</h3>
<p>9th &amp; Penn Entertainment LLC. has found the path to what we are sure to bring decades of positive change in not only our community but all across the nation. The very idea of taking on today's youth is one that many people tend to shy or just plain run away from, but the cast of the 4og’s have over 30 years of knowledge and wisdom on how to rise from the streets and change your life.   </p>
<p>Our cast consists of Harold Berry, Eric Lipscomb, Jaitee Jackson, and John Nelson. We have been friends for over 30 years and the foolishness has only grown with us. The 4oG’s are fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, uncles, and granddads that have a true understanding of their community and what it takes to navigate the streets of Indianapolis, Indiana. The 4oG’s are a group of friends that have decided to use the knowledge that they have acquired over 3 decades to try and tackle an issue that seems to be growing at a wildfires pace. The 4og's will be bridging the gap between old schools that still love hip hop and also care about today's youth and the problems that plague our children through the means of hip hop while allowing them to display their unique hip-hop talents.  </p>
<p> Hip hop and community outreach have always been hand in hand being that they were created to fight the same set of circumstances. Some of the ways to help the community and youth is to return to the community to give back the lessons you have taken away. The lessons learned from hardships must be shared with the youth in order to try and clear their path for success. Thus, decreasing the cycle of recidivism and violence for the next generation. People have been using hip hop as a means of escape from the moment it was created. Throughout the years hip hop has faced a number of criticisms to say the least. The truth is that hip hop is a tool, not a weapon and it can be used to help rebuild communities.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why should we donate to you? </h3>
<p> Just so you know there is a difference between oG and sugar daddy. Lol, we would love to be able to say that we could financially finance all of the events ourselves, but this is just not our reality. The truth is that we could use your help. Whether it be through volunteers or monetary means we appreciate all of your support.   </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $7,000 in order to purchase production software, recording equipment, promotions/ marketing, and of course to take care of our beloved backers. The funds we are asking for are to make sure that we create an atmosphere that is conducive to our guest, will give us the necessary tools we need to reach out to the youth, and allow us to fulfil our promise to our backers. Our Perks were designed to let you truly be a part of the 4oG's. We don't just want to give you trinkets and toys. We want you to become part of the village. Please check out our perks and join us on making a real change for our youth. </p>

<h3>The Community Impact</h3>
<p>These numbers are frightening to even look at, but this is what we are facing in our city of Indianapolis, Indiana. We are ranked 12th in the cities of the highest homicide rates. In 2018 there were 171 homicides, and we are at 33 homicides currently just in 2020. In 2019 660 people were killed or wounded by gun fire in our city. We are not naïve in thinking that the 4oG's are the answer to end the violence in our city, but we are willing to do our part to reach out to the youth and go out into the streets from which we come to give back the knowledge and wisdom that we have acquired through our mistakes. We may not be the answer, but we will definitely be a part of the solution.</p>
<p>One of the 4oG’s missions will be to work with the Indiana Educational board and other educational programs to help introduce basic criminal justice courses for 7th through 12th grades. Maybe it’s what our children <strong>don’t </strong>know that is getting them into trouble.  </p>
<p>Working closely with programs like M.U.M (Made Up Minds) to ensure that the individuals that are placed on work release, probation, or parole will be given the necessary tools they need to become productive members of society.   </p>
<p>The 4oG’s are committed to working with local groups, schools, activists, and our community in order to deliver informative and helpful content. We strive to reach the youth and share the knowledge and wisdom we have collected over a lifetime. We hope to become a strong tie between the youth and the programs developed to help them. The 4oG's will be reaching out to mentoring groups such as the bloomProjectinc.org  in order to place young people with the right groups and mentors to ensure better success.  </p>
<p>Indiana has done a wonderful job working with our youth and collaborating with programs throughout our state in order to bring more caring individuals and programs together to create change and invest in our youth. The 4oG’s hope to be a part of that change and work right alongside the true pioneers of this amazing journey. One of the benefits of becoming an oG is that you meet a lot of good people along your journey that are willing to help your mission.   </p>
<p> <strong>How did this happen?  </strong></p>
</div><div>

9th & Penn Entertainment LLC. has found the path to what we are sure to bring decades of positive change in not only our community but all across the nation. The very idea of taking on today's youth is one that many people tend to shy or just plain run away from, but the cast of the 4og’s have over 30 years of knowledge and wisdom on how to rise from the streets and change your life.   
Our cast consists of Harold Berry, Eric Lipscomb, Jaitee Jackson, and John Nelson. We have been friends for over 30 years and the foolishness has only grown with us. The 4oG’s are fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, uncles, and granddads that have a true understanding of their community and what it takes to navigate the streets of Indianapolis, Indiana. The 4oG’s are a group of friends that have decided to use the knowledge that they have acquired over 3 decades to try and tackle an issue that seems to be growing at a wildfires pace. The 4og's will be bridging the gap between old schools that still love hip hop and also care about today's youth and the problems that plague our children through the means of hip hop while allowing them to display their unique hip-hop talents.  
 Hip hop and community outreach have always been hand in hand being that they were created to fight the same set of circumstances. Some of the ways to help the community and youth is to return to the community to give back the lessons you have taken away. The lessons learned from hardships must be shared with the youth in order to try and clear their path for success. Thus, decreasing the cycle of recidivism and violence for the next generation. People have been using hip hop as a means of escape from the moment it was created. Throughout the years hip hop has faced a number of criticisms to say the least. The truth is that hip hop is a tool, not a weapon and it can be used to help rebuild communities.   

Why should we donate to you? 
 Just so you know there is a difference between oG and sugar daddy. Lol, we would love to be able to say that we could financially finance all of the events ourselves, but this is just not our reality. The truth is that we could use your help. Whether it be through volunteers or monetary means we appreciate all of your support.   
Our goal is to raise $7,000 in order to purchase production software, recording equipment, promotions/ marketing, and of course to take care of our beloved backers. The funds we are asking for are to make sure that we create an atmosphere that is conducive to our guest, will give us the necessary tools we need to reach out to the youth, and allow us to fulfil our promise to our backers. Our Perks were designed to let you truly be a part of the 4oG's. We don't just want to give you trinkets and toys. We want you to become part of the village. Please check out our perks and join us on making a real change for our youth.

The Community Impact
These numbers are frightening to even look at, but this is what we are facing in our city of Indianapolis, Indiana. We are ranked 12th in the cities of the highest homicide rates. In 2018 there were 171 homicides, and we are at 33 homicides currently just in 2020. In 2019 660 people were killed or wounded by gun fire in our city. We are not naïve in thinking that the 4oG's are the answer to end the violence in our city, but we are willing to do our part to reach out to the youth and go out into the streets from which we come to give back the knowledge and wisdom that we have acquired through our mistakes. We may not be the answer, but we will definitely be a part of the solution.
One of the 4oG’s missions will be to work with the Indiana Educational board and other educational programs to help introduce basic criminal justice courses for 7th through 12th grades. Maybe it’s what our children don’t know that is getting them into trouble.  
Working closely with programs like M.U.M (Made Up Minds) to ensure that the individuals that are placed on work release, probation, or parole will be given the necessary tools they need to become productive members of society.   
The 4oG’s are committed to working with local groups, schools, activists, and our community in order to deliver informative and helpful content. We strive to reach the youth and share the knowledge and wisdom we have collected over a lifetime. We hope to become a strong tie between the youth and the programs developed to help them. The 4oG's will be reaching out to mentoring groups such as the bloomProjectinc.org  in order to place young people with the right groups and mentors to ensure better success.  
Indiana has done a wonderful job working with our youth and collaborating with programs throughout our state in order to bring more caring individuals and programs together to create change and invest in our youth. The 4oG’s hope to be a part of that change and work right alongside the true pioneers of this amazing journey. One of the benefits of becoming an oG is that you meet a lot of good people along your journey that are willing to help your mission.   
 How did this happen?

<h3>What This Is</h3>
<p><i>The Dragoning</i> is a podcast that takes place in the not so distant future, wherein there is an epidemic of women turning into dragons. It's fictional, don't worry, even if right at this moment a strange epidemic feels a little weirdly possible. So in the middle of a pandemic, we're going to make a show about a dragon epidemic. Here's what we're going to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hire actors, musicians, visual artists and designers, many of who have had their work pulled out from under them</li>
<li>Create a community-made project in a moment where we cannot be in rooms together</li>
<li>Share a story that a lot of us are hungry for </li>
</ul>
<p>Your support of the podcast will not only get you the feminist dragon content you've been dreaming of, it will also help get artists meaningful work at a time when there is none.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>How will this work? Actors will record their text at home, using their home recording set-ups. Musicians will record music at home. Visual Artists will create images for the show in their homes. We need to pay each and every one of them, as well as a sound designer to help us create the atmosphere of this world and an audio engineer to help us navigate this independent recording situation. </p>
<ul>
<li>We're planning on paying everyone the SAG podcast day rate, which is $200. We need at least 10 actors. We also need to pay a composer, sound designer and audio engineer to help us get each of our 18 episodes sounding good.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Donors will get access to the podcast long before the general public. Other perks include thank you notes, stickers, audio thank you on the podcast and maybe even some visual artist designed merch. Also - we're a non-profit, so you also get a tax deduction! </span></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of us feel helpless, scared and trapped as the world changes so dramatically around us. As theatre practitioners, our entire art form, the one we've dedicated our whole lives to, has been ripped away from us. To have a juicy creative project to work on will be incredibly meaningful to a lot of artists whose lives have always depended on making theatre. </p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you want to hear a new engaging podcast about dragons or want to support some artists who not only need financial support but a creative project or both, your donation will help us help a lot of people. </li>
<li>We've made so much theatre to be performed in live spaces, with live human beings in a live experience and now it's time for to experiment with a new form. Emily has made two solo podcasts without any funding. This one needs some financial wind under its sails but making it and setting it up will be a piece of cake. We got this. </li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We're </span>continually looking for ways to include more people, to bring excitement and creative spark to as many people as possible. As this project evolves, we're sure there will be more community driven aspects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div><p>Making things from afar is not easy. None of us know how to do social distance creativity. It is unprecedented. Our audio will inevitably be a little uneven due to being recorded in multiple locations by multiple people without audio engineers to organize us. It requires a lot of independent performance without other actors and no director in the room. We're going to be cobbling together a lot of disparate elements into one cohesive story. It will not be easy. But we're up for the challenge and we're going to bring you along with us for the ride. </p></div><div>

If the funding goal is not reached the podcast may not be able to continue.  What You Get Contribute $1-$49 you will receive eternal gratitude and the pleasure of listening to incredible expedition stories from around the world by like-minded people. Contribute over $50 you will receive the audiobook of my bestselling TEAMS ON THE EDGE book (not currently available to the public).Contribute over $100 you will receive a signed paperback copy (free shipping) and the audio version of TEAMS ON THE EDGE and get mentioned on a podcast as a show supporter Contribute over $1000 receive a signed paperback copy and the audio version of TEAMS ON THE EDGE and get mentioned on every podcast for 6 months as a show supporter.  Of course, you can remain anonymous as well. Track Record I am a self-starter and have never been afraid to take the lead on new projects. This will be my 3rd podcast so the learning curve will be limited. I currently host the Plant-Based Profits podcast and several years ago I hosted the Home Office Dad podcast. Other projects I have started from scratch include the Paradise Triathlon (St. John’s, NL), writing TEAMS ON THE EDGE book, and starting the International Vegan Film Festival. Risks & ChallengesThere is a very low risk involved with this campaign. Not finding enough guests If we do not reach our fundraising goal the quality of the podcast may suffer as there will be cutbacks to the production costs i.e. audio editing, show notes, social media marketingThere is a small chance of equipment failure (mic, computer, etc) causing unexpected expenses in order to continue the podcast Family or other unforeseen emergencies could use up time carved out to record interviews and produce the show. Despite the pandemic causing 2 of my 3 kids to be schooling from home right now, I believe I have the time to take on this meaningful project. As the pandemic subsides and the Fall of 2021 rolls around I will have all 3 kids in school and even more time to focus in this project. Other Ways You Can HelpTell all your friends and family who you think may be interested in listening to the podcast and supporting this campaign. Offer help with social media management, audio editing, writing simple show notes, etc.And that's all there is to it, thank you so much for your support!! Shawn",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>My name is James and I'm the creator and main host of Modern-Day Debate. I'm working on my PhD in organizational psychology and I LOVE debates &amp; discussions.</p>
<p>We started Modern-Day Debate about 2 years ago because we wanted to ensure that people from all walks of life had a fully-neutral and<strong> fair </strong>platform they could make their case on, or hear other people make their case on!</p>
<p>We host debates on science, religion, and politics, because we believe debate has the potential to change cultures for the better by getting people with different perspectives to communicate, and to show that <strong>people can disagree and still be friends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About This Event</strong></p>
<p>We believe that this particular debate between atheist, Matt Dillahunty and Christian, Dr Kenny Rhodes will help people from all walks of life learn more about other perspectives as this debate will be live-streamed for the world to see (and remain on the Modern-Day Debate YouTube channel afterward).</p>
<p><strong>Our Funding Plan:</strong></p>
<p>We have an overall goal of $3,500 to make this event happen! Details are in our infographic below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607532727/dmmfwkguz4dcudwt6c5y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Perks:</strong></p>
<p>We have a variety of perks including getting your name shouted out at the end of the debate during the thank you shout outs, getting a Modern-Day Debate embossed thank you postcard in the mail as a souvenir for this EPIC event, a meet &amp; greet with the speakers prior to the debate, or a Modern-Day Debate t-shirt!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, 100% of the donations are returned! If we pass our goal, we plan on using the extra funds for extra promotion (e.g., YouTube &amp; Facebook ads) and putting the money toward the costs of another future epic debate!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Help us get the word out by sharing this project with other people who love debates and intellectual ideas!</p>
<p>You can even use the convenient Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>*Due to COVID concerns, this debate will be remote over Zoom. </p>
<p>If you don't get what was promised, we promise a 100% refund on your donation. We want there to be zero risk for you, the audience. Therefore, if this event does not happen, everyone who donated at any tier gets 100% of their money back. </p>
<p>Our own risk is whether or not we can raise the funds, as we do not want to contact the speakers (which we already have) and not make our goal of raising the funds to pay the honorariums we have promised. We are 100% determined to make this event happen!<br/> </p>

We have a variety of perks including getting your name shouted out at the end of the debate during the thank you shout outs, getting a Modern-Day Debate embossed thank you postcard in the mail as a souvenir for this EPIC event, a meet & greet with the speakers prior to the debate, or a Modern-Day Debate t-shirt!
If we don't reach our goal, 100% of the donations are returned! If we pass our goal, we plan on using the extra funds for extra promotion (e.g., YouTube & Facebook ads) and putting the money toward the costs of another future epic debate!
Other Ways You Can Help

Help us get the word out by sharing this project with other people who love debates and intellectual ideas!
You can even use the convenient Indiegogo share tools!
Risks and Challenges
*Due to COVID concerns, this debate will be remote over Zoom. 
If you don't get what was promised, we promise a 100% refund on your donation. We want there to be zero risk for you, the audience. Therefore, if this event does not happen, everyone who donated at any tier gets 100% of their money back. 
Our own risk is whether or not we can raise the funds, as we do not want to contact the speakers (which we already have) and not make our goal of raising the funds to pay the honorariums we have promised. We are 100% determined to make this event happen!",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Josh Combs, an artist and Star Wars fanatic. Me and my lifelong friend Stefan Spallino, who has probably been obsessed with Star Wars from the womb, are going to be getting loose and talking Star Wars every Wednesday night, along with a variety of guests. We will be providing the latest Star Wars news and rumors, we will be covering a variety of topics including deep character histories, movie breakdowns, animated series, video games, Star Wars Land, ridiculous and awesome fan theories, our own predictions for the future of the franchise and we will take a closer look at the history and making of the Star Wars Universe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to keep the show interactive and entertaining, we would like to broadcast on video, possibly live. Currently, we are designing and building the set so we are forced to record audio-only episodes in the shed in my backyard. With your help, we can buy decent video and audio equipment and lighting.</p>
<p>As a fan of podcasts and Star Wars, we have noticed there are only a few who interact with their viewers and allow them to share their insight and love of Star Wars. Your participation in our crowdfunding campaign will benefit you as a viewer:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a $1 donation you will recieve one free entry to our first monthly collectible toy giveaway. This month we are giving away one 6"" Princess Leia Organa Black Series Figure, with her famous white robe and side buns from Episode 4 and (spoiler alert) The end of Rogue One.</li>

The host, Chris Rauch, was first diagnosed with depression at age 19 and at 40 had his diagnosis modified to Bi-polar disorder type II. Chris will walk listeners through the reality of living with what is often a mis-understood illness. In an effort to break the stigma surrounding mental illness Chris will interview people with mental illness and talk frankly about daily living. Some of the interviewees will have found the strength and courage to live well while battling the emotional turmoil that is mental illness. Chris will focus on these strategies in an effort to share a message of hope with those people who are overwhelmed daily by trying to manage their illness.  <i>Living Well with Mental Illness</i> is also intended for the family and friends of people burdened with mental illness by providing the insights that will produce a positive impact in the lives of loved ones.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>What I need </u></strong></p><p><u>I need your help</u> to launch this effort.  There are several ways that your assistance would be welcomed. </p><ul>

<p>The podcast has been a wonderful experience and I am having so much fun getting to speak with so many amazing people that make up Atlanta’s vibrant theatre community. But the fun is also time-consuming, and most assuredly not free. I’m currently borrowing some of the equipment for recording purposes and would like to return it to their rightful owners. The program also has host-site costs paid monthly to our wonderful partners at Audioboom.</p>
<p>Additionally, I’m looking to expand the scope of our programming by hosting group conversations and town halls with industry leaders and field specialists to help shine a light on broader topics of discussion within our community.</p>
<p>ALL THIS TO SAY ----</p>
<p>If you enjoy the program and would like to contribute to its continued growth and success, please consider a donation via this Indiegogo Campaign!</p>
<p>Think of it like an NPR Fund Drive; your financial contribution helps cover the costs of creating and producing this show. A little bit goes a long way!</p>
<p>And if you can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help!</p>

</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In September 2017, Sammie, a badass woman of color, decided to start a Facebook page because she wanted a place where she could have a voice and be heard. In her words, “a place where I could reach more people and not be spoken over or silenced. I wanted to be able to provide education to privileged people and help them unpack their biases”.  She started the page by naming it “Sammie the Token Brown Girl” and began her journey to creating these safe spaces for others. Before creating the page, Sammie held an important Facebook presence in various Facebook groups as someone who was committed to advocating for others who traditionally have been without a voice in greater the conversation around social injustices. She was known for tirelessly educating others on feminist issues, issues of racism, and so much more. She has been a trusted person for a lot of people, which is what has lead to such a popular following of her page.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Why Starting this Podcast is Important</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We’ve learned that through stories and personal connection, we all learn the most about compassion, and this is why supporting our podcast is truly important. At the end of the day, we are storytellers, giving voice to our stories and to the stories of others who deserve to be heard.  This gives direct access to others into the lives of those, whose stories may otherwise not be heard. In educating others, we aim to develop a more compassionate community of people who can go out into the world and use the stories they connect with to create local and wide-spread change. We want people to be armed with important information so that they can walk through the world with the confidence that is often times needed to confront racism, sexism, transphobia, ableism, anti-blackness, and other forms of oppression faced by those living in the margins of our communities. We are three Women of Color who live and breathe the experience of various forms of marginalization, and in our current social and political climate, it's important that women of color voices are heard, amplified, and supported! It is very important to us to expand into the world of podcasting because it is such a widely followed and intimate outlet for spreading messages that can change the world! Or at least change the way our listeners see the world around them.</p>

In September 2017, Sammie, a badass woman of color, decided to start a Facebook page because she wanted a place where she could have a voice and be heard. In her words, “a place where I could reach more people and not be spoken over or silenced. I wanted to be able to provide education to privileged people and help them unpack their biases”.  She started the page by naming it “Sammie the Token Brown Girl” and began her journey to creating these safe spaces for others. Before creating the page, Sammie held an important Facebook presence in various Facebook groups as someone who was committed to advocating for others who traditionally have been without a voice in greater the conversation around social injustices. She was known for tirelessly educating others on feminist issues, issues of racism, and so much more. She has been a trusted person for a lot of people, which is what has lead to such a popular following of her page. Shortly after starting her page, she decided to bring on two other women of color, Chiany and Erica, to bring in other important perspectives on the experiences of women of color. The name of the page was quickly changed to “Three Token Brown Girls”, and together, the three of them built a following of over 3,000 people who supported their work and their voices.

<h3>We Need You!</h3>
<p>Tannhauser Gate is committed to bringing you quality that you don’t usually find in most free podcast content. As lovers of this medium, we’re also committed to supporting those who make it happen — which means paying our actors.</p>
<p>Our goal of $20,000 will help us create the entire first season of <i>The Watch</i>, including actor fees, studio sessions at the legendary GAP Digital in Wheaton, IL, high-quality sound effects and foley, theme music, etc. </p>
<p>As a Thank You for making <i>The Watch</i> happen, we have several levels of perks and rewards for you! These include early access to commercial-free episodes, behind-the-scenes content, 1-on-1 virtual meetings with the creators, and more! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that in times like these, it is important to provide positive, entertaining content. Co-creator Darby Kern explains: “So many cop television shows are wrapping things up, or putting an irresponsible spin on law enforcement. <i>The Watch</i> is designed to give the audience an idea of what cops go through in the course of their day, at work, and at home. They have problems like all of us and sometimes they let their problems define them.”</p>
<p>To add to the realism of the show, Tannhauser Gate has engaged the services of our technical advisor, a retired 25-year veteran of the Milwaukee Police Department. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let’s be honest: as with any media project, the single biggest hurdle is always going to be finding the audience. We’re in the process of building our social media presence, but I’ll tell you, the greatest asset to finding an audience is word of mouth. Which, what a coincidence, brings us to...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it! You may be excited about this project, but there’s not a lot you can do financially. That’s okay! You can still be a part of the success and ongoing existence of <i>The Watch</i>. The biggest way you can help, outside funding, is to simply spread the word. If you’re interested, maybe some of your friends are, too! Let them know! </p>
<p>And if you’re the praying sort, that’s ALWAYS helpful. Our team are big believers in the power of prayer and, even though this is not a ”religious“ or faith-based project, we still pray over both its success and its message. </p>
<p> </p>

Let’s be honest: as with any media project, the single biggest hurdle is always going to be finding the audience. We’re in the process of building our social media presence, but I’ll tell you, the greatest asset to finding an audience is word of mouth. Which, what a coincidence, brings us to...

Other Ways You Can Help
We get it! You may be excited about this project, but there’s not a lot you can do financially. That’s okay! You can still be a part of the success and ongoing existence of The Watch. The biggest way you can help, outside funding, is to simply spread the word. If you’re interested, maybe some of your friends are, too! Let them know! 
And if you’re the praying sort, that’s ALWAYS helpful. Our team are big believers in the power of prayer and, even though this is not a ”religious“ or faith-based project, we still pray over both its success and its message.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As the DanceSpeak podcast approaches its 2-year mark it is experiencing a massive growth spurt!  Yes, it is hard to believe that we have essentially grown and spread through word-of-mouth and organic sharing.   With consistency and high-quality guests, we have discovered that the world is our oyster and the potential of this grass-roots podcast in positively impacting those whom love and pursue dance is limitless.  We want to make sure that keep on serving our listeners with powerful episodes and keeping up-to-date on technology.  Moreover, we want to have videos on POINT and to keep delivering content that you love in ways that suit different needs (i.e. short episodes and snippets that are easy to consume on the go for your busy lifestyle).  </p>
<p> We are opening the door to have listeners and supporters of the podcast partake in our thriving through donating an amount that feels good to you.  Whether it is $1, $3, or $3,000 (hayyy) everything makes a world of difference.  </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 to go towards filming interviews, producing content on a consistent (ideally at least weekly) basis, to increase the sound quality, hire PR, updating equipment and purchasing much needed video editing software.  We would also like to be able to pay our team members for the time they put in, as they have kindly been donating their time and we want to keep them on board!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of the DanceSpeak conversations is to provide free content to educate dancers, choreographers, and teachers whom aspire to reach their highest potential in our field (as well as those in other highly competitive fields).  Our interviews with heavy hitters in the industry provide legacy for those being interviewed, information that can give its listeners more fruitful and long-lasting careers, and ultimately connects us with the human side of the industry. </p>

<u>Epilogue</u>:</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A narrative nonfiction podcast about suicide, grief, mental illness, and resilience</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558992373/fehabnutqtq8aeswull3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Galen McCaw, and on January 2nd of 2018, I woke up to learn that my Dad, after decades of struggling with mental illness, took his own life. I found myself struggling to connect with others in the months afterwards, wary of the strange silence that often followed the few words I managed to find, and exhausted at the thought of trying to fill that silence. After all, what do you say to someone who’s suffered that kind of loss? Or after you’ve suffered it?</p> <p>I discovered the power of listening when I attended my first support group for people who have lost loved ones to suicide. For two hours, those in attendance offered beloved memories, sorrow, laughter, anger, regret, and joy to the others around them in communion. I left wanting to find ways of connecting with and learning from others who carry loss, in their own way, in the wake of suicide. And there are so many. Based on the statistics we are able to collect, someone around the world dies by their own hand every 40 seconds.</p> <p>We hope to honor those who have passed, ourselves, and everyone else out there bearing grief on a daily basis by telling stories about the very human experience of loss. Epilogue will be a non-fiction storytelling podcast about people experiencing suicide loss, grief, and mental illness, and ultimately the resilience it takes to continue on in the face of these struggles. Each story will be told in one roughly hour long episode, in a long form narrative format. </p>

<p>I met my collaborators, Laura Bargfeld and Carolyn McKee, in film school at The University of Arizona. I am an Emmy-awarded sound recordist and editor working in documentary, commercial, and narrative film production. Laura received her BA in creative writing with a minor in film and television, and has experience in creative nonfiction, documentary film editing, and producing. Carolyn is a filmmaker, visual artist, writer, and educator; she earned a BFA film and television, and a BA in philosophy.</p> <p>We grew together over the course of many creative projects, and have become steadfast supporters of each other throughout our own mental health struggles. With every project, and every conversation we share, we feel more convinced of the power of storytelling to connect and heal. Our collective skill set and lived experience give us the tools to create a platform for these stories to be shared and explored widely, and we want to make sure the project isn’t something we do alone. It’s about all of us, the diversity of perspectives and experiences we hope to represent, and including communities outside our own.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where We’re At</h3> <p>Right now, our goal is to raise enough money to produce a pilot episode and to continue moving forward with our mission of creating a series. Long form nonfiction storytelling is time and resource intensive, which is why we need to raise money to fund that process. We will be working with composers to create original music like what you heard in our trailer, as well as with consultants who will help sell advertising, form partnerships, and market the podcast.</p> <p>Since we began development in October 2018, we’ve recorded over 50 hours of interviews with 20 subjects to hone in on the identity of the project. But that's just the start. Ultimately, we intend to create a collection of stories that represent the reach that suicide and mental illness have across demographics, time, and place. But before we do that, what we need are the resources to prove our concept, to dig deeper and spend the time to tell one story in a way that respects its complexity.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h3> <p>We’ve identified the following production and development costs which will enable us to move forward with our pilot episode and continue our development process:</p> <p>Software/recording equipment: <strong>$3,070</strong></p>
<p>Travel: <strong>$3,000</strong></p>
<p>Consulting: <strong>$2,025</strong></p>
<p>Website fees/transcription services: <strong>$1,400</strong></p>
<p>Total: <strong>$9,495</strong></p> <p>Contingency: Professional budgeting in creative media projects will include a percentage of total budget (usually 5-10%) to account for unforeseen expenses and variations in cost of resources</p>

</div></div>","Epilogue:
A narrative nonfiction podcast about suicide, grief, mental illness, and resilience

My name is Galen McCaw, and on January 2nd of 2018, I woke up to learn that my Dad, after decades of struggling with mental illness, took his own life. I found myself struggling to connect with others in the months afterwards, wary of the strange silence that often followed the few words I managed to find, and exhausted at the thought of trying to fill that silence. After all, what do you say to someone who’s suffered that kind of loss? Or after you’ve suffered it? I discovered the power of listening when I attended my first support group for people who have lost loved ones to suicide. For two hours, those in attendance offered beloved memories, sorrow, laughter, anger, regret, and joy to the others around them in communion. I left wanting to find ways of connecting with and learning from others who carry loss, in their own way, in the wake of suicide. And there are so many. Based on the statistics we are able to collect, someone around the world dies by their own hand every 40 seconds. We hope to honor those who have passed, ourselves, and everyone else out there bearing grief on a daily basis by telling stories about the very human experience of loss. Epilogue will be a non-fiction storytelling podcast about people experiencing suicide loss, grief, and mental illness, and ultimately the resilience it takes to continue on in the face of these struggles. Each story will be told in one roughly hour long episode, in a long form narrative format. 
 
Who We Are
 
 
I met my collaborators, Laura Bargfeld and Carolyn McKee, in film school at The University of Arizona. I am an Emmy-awarded sound recordist and editor working in documentary, commercial, and narrative film production. Laura received her BA in creative writing with a minor in film and television, and has experience in creative nonfiction, documentary film editing, and producing. Carolyn is a filmmaker, visual artist, writer, and educator; she earned a BFA film and television, and a BA in philosophy. We grew together over the course of many creative projects, and have become steadfast supporters of each other throughout our own mental health struggles. With every project, and every conversation we share, we feel more convinced of the power of storytelling to connect and heal. Our collective skill set and lived experience give us the tools to create a platform for these stories to be shared and explored widely, and we want to make sure the project isn’t something we do alone. It’s about all of us, the diversity of perspectives and experiences we hope to represent, and including communities outside our own. Where We’re At Right now, our goal is to raise enough money to produce a pilot episode and to continue moving forward with our mission of creating a series. Long form nonfiction storytelling is time and resource intensive, which is why we need to raise money to fund that process. We will be working with composers to create original music like what you heard in our trailer, as well as with consultants who will help sell advertising, form partnerships, and market the podcast. Since we began development in October 2018, we’ve recorded over 50 hours of interviews with 20 subjects to hone in on the identity of the project. But that's just the start. Ultimately, we intend to create a collection of stories that represent the reach that suicide and mental illness have across demographics, time, and place. But before we do that, what we need are the resources to prove our concept, to dig deeper and spend the time to tell one story in a way that respects its complexity. What We Need We’ve identified the following production and development costs which will enable us to move forward with our pilot episode and continue our development process: Software/recording equipment: $3,070
Travel: $3,000
Consulting: $2,025
Website fees/transcription services: $1,400
Total: $9,495 Contingency: Professional budgeting in creative media projects will include a percentage of total budget (usually 5-10%) to account for unforeseen expenses and variations in cost of resources
%5 of Total: $474.75 (Rounded to $505) TOTAL GOAL $10,000 Where We’re Going Once we have a trailer and pilot episode, our next step is to pitch the project to community mental health providers, non-profits, and private companies. Our goal will be to take on sponsors and partner organizations who can help support the project’s development and guide its growth. With local branches of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, numerous healthcare providers and mental health non-profits, and a vibrant art scene in our community, there is an amazing culture of support in which a creative project like ours can thrive. With the proper foundation, a storytelling project like this will fill a real need for people experiencing mental illness, suicide loss, and grief. Get in Touch Please reach out directly if you have any ideas about how you can be a part of our project, what the project might look like or how it can integrate with your work, art, or research, or if you have any specific questions we haven’t covered! Contact:

<p align=""center""><strong><u>What is Who Knows?</u></strong></p>
<p align=""center"">Hello! Thank you so much for taking the time to check out Who Knows?</p>
<p>My name is Taylor Dankovich and I am a sound designer, podcast producer and audio engineer based in Greensboro, North Carolina. I love to create entertaining work that also reaches people mentally and emotionally. I am motivated and inspired by creativity and innovation, self-improvement, and helping others in every way I can.</p>
<p>My goal is to bring awareness to the importance of mental health and to remove the stigma surrounding mental health struggles.</p>
<p>I have struggled mentally and emotionally my entire life. In my teen years, I would freely express my feelings to other people only to notice their discomfort, as if they were afraid of emotions. It left me feeling as if I was the only one dealing with intense negative emotions and overwhelming confusion. That all changed when I left college and discovered that many people felt the same way but were just not openly talking about it. I thought to myself “Imagine what it would be like if we started confessing to others that we don’t have it all together? We could learn a lot from each other.”</p>
<p>I decided to use my skills in audio and my passion for mental health advocacy to create Who Knows?</p>
<p>Who Knows? is a podcast that works to promote mental health awareness, self-love and creating your own normal. It explores life in a way that is transparent, honest and curious.</p>
<p>We have lively and honest discussion about all the messy, confusing and scary stuff all of us go through. We talk about both the good <i>and</i> the bad because “the bad” is just stuff that’s a little more complicated. It’s about learning and growing, tearing down walls, opening up, asking questions and giving our best advice.</p>
<p>We’re here to remind you that you’re not alone and that mental health matters.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><u>Our Story So Far</u></strong></p>
<p>Since Who Knows? began in 2017, three great podcast seasons have been brought to life covering 25 different topics such as Gender, Friendship, Small Business Management, and Body Positivity. The stories of 29 amazing and inspiring people who share my passion for mental health advocacy have been told. We have grown our listener numbers, our social media platforms and, most importantly, we have begun to build a community of individuals seeking to make conversation about mental health a part of everyday life.  </p>
<p>The moments of success have shown that there is a desire for content that is relatable, not only to those who struggle with diagnosed mental health issues, but to anyone who’s ever felt a sense of unbelonging and are searching for a community that understands them. People are looking for entertaining content that promotes personal growth and learning through a real-life lens. They want to hear real stories from honest people. They want advice from those who are succeeding in areas where they are struggling. They want to feel less alone.</p>
<p>I am so proud of what Who Knows? has begun to accomplish as a podcast, but when I think about the future of Who Knows?, I dream of extending beyond the podcasting platform.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><u>More Than a Podcast</u></strong></p>
<p>I started this podcast because I am a person who needs this podcast.  From conversations with friends, co-workers, and listeners of Who Knows?, I know there are others who are looking for more mental health-based content that feels real and relatable.</p>
<p>Mental Health exists as an essential part of everyday life. Instagram, YouTube, blogs, podcasts and other media platforms have also become an essential part of everyone’s daily life as sources of entertainment, inspiration, education, community and emotional support, with creators becoming mentors and friends.</p>
<p>Who Knows? is that mentor and friend, and I want to be able to reach our friends wherever they are and find new ones in more places. Who Knows? can be more than a podcast, it can be a mental health entertainment media community.</p>
<p>I want to create more avenues for people to consume content that is rooted in self-love and mental health advocacy. Content that helps people to gain information, promotes personal growth and offers advice for those who are on their own journey in life. I want to empower others to face their fears and be who they are.</p>
<p>My mission is to show that emotional and mental health struggles are a part of life, but they do not have to prevent you from living.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><u>What We Need </u></strong></p>
<p>The goal is to take Who Knows? from a mental health podcast to a mental health-based media company. Growing our audience is essential to achieving this goal, and to do that we need to offer more content in more places to expand our reach.</p>
<p>In its current form, Who Knows? exists in <strong><u>podcasting, social media, and Patreon</u></strong>. As I begin branching out into other platforms, I want to offer <strong><u>weekly videos and weekly blog posts</u></strong>. This is only the beginning of what I ultimately hope to offer at the height of the company’s existence, but with your donation, this is where I hope to start.</p>
<p>Making this a reality requires me to maintain total focus on creating these additional forms of content. Creating is a full-time job and currently I am doing it for only $20 a month. $5,000 will be a steppingstone for me to begin to make Who Knows? my full-time job by spending 100% of my work time creating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biweekly Podcast Episodes</li>
<li>Daily Social Media Content</li>
<li>Weekly Videos</li>
<li>Weekly Blog Posts</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this content begins to circulate, my hope is that our community numbers will begin to grow, the work will begin to generate revenue on its own through ad sales and additional Patreon subscribers, and Who Knows? will begin to go from a dream to a fully functioning business. Your donations will help to begin a new career path for me, the creation of an array of content that is based in the importance of self-love and mental health, and more visibility for those who struggle with their mental health.</p>
<p>This podcast is the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think about when I go to bed. Working on this show has helped me to improve and explore my own mental health. Its moments of success have shown that I am capable of more than I ever saw possible for myself. I love the work that I do and I am so proud of what this show has become so far, but I want to do so much more. I see a vision for growth and longevity for Who Knows? that goes beyond me and my home office. Eventually I hope to hire a team of creators to work with me, to be able to offer merchandise and live performances, and so much more.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><u>What You Get</u></strong></p>
<p>If you are able to contribute any amount to this vision, you will be helping make a dream a reality. The countless hours of work, sleepless nights, and weeks of anxiety will have been worth it for me knowing that there are people out there who see the value in mental health advocacy, visibility, as well as the importance of the work of artists and creators who bring entertaining, heartfelt and meaningful content to life. </p>

<h3>Brief Summary</h3>
<p>Four Elements is in essence a storytelling podcast. This story is told via roleplaying, using a game system developed just for this project called Destiny RPG. The podcast features a diverse, queer cast of characters navigating deadly obstacles in an intricate world filled with danger and supernatural power. </p>
<h3>The World</h3>
<p>The Land of Mezara has a human history spanning 1000 years, from the time the refugee tribes first set foot on Mezaran soil, fleeing from that which they had left behind. Since then humanity has expanded over the once-wild land, inhabited previously only by spirits and wildlife. Cultures formed, empires rose and fell. Most notable among these empires was Zhougo, also known as the Earth Empire. Today's calendars are dated from the fall of this Empire, which spanned Mezara's largest continent. This marks the start date of the podcast's timeline as 118 years After the Empire, or 118 AE. </p>
<p>Listen to a few minute Lore Episode at <a href=""https://anchor.fm/fourelements/episodes/The-Lore-of-Mezara--Part-1-eas4cn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://anchor.fm/fourelements/episodes/The-Lor...</a> for more on the world.</p>

<h3>The Overarching Story</h3>
<p>Four Elements tells a universal story about the role humanity has in the fundamental balance of nature, and how it effects us all when that balance is broken. </p>
<p>It is a cautionary tale of the rise of fascism in times of great crisis, and the role that hope plays in both giving rise to and defeating evil.</p>
<p>Through storytelling, we strive to approach real-world issues in a setting that is completely disparate from the real world.</p>
<h3>The Personal Story</h3>
<p>Four Elements follows a cast of young heroes on a journey of self discovery, exploring the relationships between people forced into an impossible situation. </p>
<p>The story explores the boundaries between hero and antihero, asking the difficult questions that come with heroic figures.</p>
<p>Moments of great strength and of great weakness accompany moments of levity, a reminder that laughter can be found in the hardest of times.</p>

</div></div>","Brief Summary
Four Elements is in essence a storytelling podcast. This story is told via roleplaying, using a game system developed just for this project called Destiny RPG. The podcast features a diverse, queer cast of characters navigating deadly obstacles in an intricate world filled with danger and supernatural power. 
The World
The Land of Mezara has a human history spanning 1000 years, from the time the refugee tribes first set foot on Mezaran soil, fleeing from that which they had left behind. Since then humanity has expanded over the once-wild land, inhabited previously only by spirits and wildlife. Cultures formed, empires rose and fell. Most notable among these empires was Zhougo, also known as the Earth Empire. Today's calendars are dated from the fall of this Empire, which spanned Mezara's largest continent. This marks the start date of the podcast's timeline as 118 years After the Empire, or 118 AE. 
Listen to a few minute Lore Episode at https://anchor.fm/fourelements/episodes/The-Lor... for more on the world.

The Overarching Story
Four Elements tells a universal story about the role humanity has in the fundamental balance of nature, and how it effects us all when that balance is broken. 
It is a cautionary tale of the rise of fascism in times of great crisis, and the role that hope plays in both giving rise to and defeating evil.
Through storytelling, we strive to approach real-world issues in a setting that is completely disparate from the real world.
The Personal Story
Four Elements follows a cast of young heroes on a journey of self discovery, exploring the relationships between people forced into an impossible situation. 
The story explores the boundaries between hero and antihero, asking the difficult questions that come with heroic figures.
Moments of great strength and of great weakness accompany moments of levity, a reminder that laughter can be found in the hardest of times.

The Game
Destiny RPG is a tabletop roleplaying game system developed by Tommy Schuberth, Creator of Four Elements. This system uses elements of chance and character building to create an environment built for improvised storytelling. 
Destiny focuses on Heroes, who are essentially any character with a full set of stats. Heroes accumulate Destiny over time, which allows them to reach new Levels of Destiny and become more powerful and skilled. 
Destiny uses d8s, d6s, and d4s to represent the three main categories of statistic: Essence, Abilities, and Skills. Each of the 3 Essences, (Mind, Body, Spirit) have two Abilities which stem from them, and each of the 6 abilities have two Skills which stem from them, resulting in 12 skills total.
Each roll uses the relevant Essence dice (d8s), Ability Dice (d6s), and Skill Dice (d4s). On any die, a result of 4 or higher is a success. An 8 is a double success. The number of successes compared to the difficulty of the check decides to what degree the Hero was successful.
The Gamebook for Destiny: Four Elements is in development, and will be launched in 2021.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>My name is Lisette Alvarez. I am a queer, Latinx creator passionate about spreading magick and supporting creativity wherever I can find it--including within myself. <i>Kalila Stormfire</i> was my small, personal creative experiment that exploded into an invaluable part of my life. The show that I wrote, acted, produced, and marketed all by myself became something that has generated over 60,000 downloads in less than a year. </p>
<p>Kalila Stormfire's first season focused on the character's struggles against a mysterious saboteur hellbent on ruining her magick business. The second season forces Kalila to venture out into the greater world of the city of Brushland, where a larger power struggle is at play. Season 2 premieres February 2019. </p>
<p>The idea for this story came about because yes, I--like Kalila--am a brown, queer witch. While many of the practices, potions, and spells are entirely fictional, they are based in some version of the truth. I’ve picked up plenty of juicy, witchy, storytelling-worthy notes in my years studying and practicing witchcraft, mysticism, the occult, and folk religions. </p>
<p>I have on-boarded a cast of incredibly talented voice actors--some very new to audio drama and other seasoned professionals in the podcasting sphere. I have also hired a sound designer who will give me more time to focus on writing, directing, and shaping the story. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I believe in paying creators and artists fair wages. I am an indie producer, so I am limited to what I can personally provide. </p>
<p>Actors are paid $75 for features like character mini-episodes and supporting roles during at least half of a full episode, and $20-40 for small features like 1-2 short scenes or lines in a full episode. In order to keep cast list short so people can receive a decent paycheck from this project, most actors will be asked to play multiple roles. Luckily, Patreon funds most of the cast wages. </p>
<p>Our sound designer, Sarah Buchynski, will be paid $100-$150 per episode. </p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to pay myself for my work. I put around 8-10 hours of writing and acting per episode. I also work as the sole marketer, from pushing merch to engaging with folks on social media about 5 hours per week. In total, that's about 15 hours per episode. According to where I live, in the DC-area, living wage would be about $17 per hour. Just paying myself would add up to about $255 per episode. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543433407/te4dzhse5qymwszsutmz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In total, my goal is to fully fund the sound design for Season 2, create a buffer for the actor wages, and possibly raise some funds to pay myself.</p>
<p>That is why the goal is set for $3,000. Any additional funds raised will be evenly split between raising the actor's wages, sound design wages, producer wages, and savings towards Season 3. </p>
<h3>Now For The Fun Stuff: Rewards</h3>
<p>I have developed a number of incredible rewards in order to thank you for your support. </p>
<p><strong>Sigil Tokens</strong></p>

<p><strong>Virtual Tarot Reading</strong></p>
<p>Want to meet a witch face to face? Well, with this perk you will receive a personalized tarot reading from me, Lisette Alvarez, over video/phone chat!</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>Of course, there's always a risk in any production. Whether it is pushed deadlines for episode releases due to external circumstances (i.e. a car crash involving an actor...which happened last season) or delays in shipment of rewards. However, I am committed to being transparent about the process to my patrons, supporters, and cast &amp; crew. I have a production newsletter to keep my cast &amp; crew updated on any changes. My patrons on Patreon can also attest that I will address any issues with rewards as soon as possible, including issues with shipping (i.e. pins being lost in the mail...which has also happened). </p>
<p>If we don't reach the stretch goal of $3,000, I will not be taking a paycheck from this campaign. If we don't reach the goal of $2,000 to safely pay for all the sound design and incidental acting costs of the season--I will likely have to go back to doing a chunk of the sound design myself. The current income generated from Patreon covers paying the cast so far. At worst, I will have to pay the actors out of pocket.</p>

<h3>Mi a Szabad Pécs?</h3>
<p>Független híroldal, ahol betartjuk a szakmailag megalapozott újságírás követelményeit és szeretünk műfajokkal kísérletezni. Elsősorban Pécsre, Baranyára, Dél-Dunántúlra koncentrálunk, de számos országos jelentőségű üggyel is foglalkoztunk, foglalkozunk.</p>
<p>Ahogy bizonyára Te is tudod, a független újságírás helyzete egyre nehezebb, ennek okait rengeteg helyen mások sokkal alaposabban leírták. A szélsőségesen torz magyar hirdetési piacon egyre kevesebb tisztességes kiadvány tud megélni. Már ott tartunk, hogy nagy múltú, nagy elérésű szakmai műhelyek is sokszor közvetlen olvasói támogatásra szorulnak. </p>
<p>Mi is tennénk a dolgunkat, nem panaszkodunk, megoldást keresünk. Ennek egyik módja, hogy segítséget kérünk tőletek.</p>
<p><strong>Segítsetek nekünk, hogy az elkövetkező évben nyugodtan dolgozhassunk!</strong></p>
<p>Eddig is támogatásokból működött a Szabad Pécs (amit, ezúton is köszönünk), azonban ez ebben a formában már nem fenntartható. A rendes működéshez ennek a kampánynak a sikerére, hirdetési bevételekre, és pályázati finanszírozásra is szükség van. Mindhárom szempontból bizakodóak vagyunk. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Mit kérünk? </h3>
<p>Ahhoz, hogy a munkakörülményeink az alapvető minimumoknak megfeleljenek számításaink szerint évente 13-15 millió forintra van szükség. Ebből nagyjából két főállású, egy mellékállású újságíró munkájának a költségeit, adminisztrációs, irodai, technikai és jogi költségeket tudnánk fedezni. A teljes összegnek kicsit több mint a felét, azaz kb. 8 millió forintot szeretnénk a segítségetekkel összegyűjteni.</p>
<p>Ha valamennyivel több jön össze, mint a kitűzött cél, akkor újabb, kisebb projekteket indítunk, hogy jobban elérjük a potenciális olvasóinkat. De konkrét terveink vannak arra az esetre  is, ha a kitűzött célunknál lényegesen több jön össze -- ebben az esetben újabb kiadványokat indítanánk az ország más régióiban.</p>
<h3>Miért itt?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Az Indiegogo rengeteg hasonló projektnek segített már elindulni, fennmaradni. Azért választottuk a közösségi finanszírozásnak ezt a formáját, mert szeretnénk, ha a kampány eredménye nyilvános és átlátható lenne. Még akkor is, ha ennek költségei vannak.</p>
<h3>Nehézségek?</h3>
<p>Na, azok vannak.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Hogyan segíthetsz még?</h3>
<p>Ha nem tudsz anyagilag hozzájárulni a kampányhoz, de egyetértesz a céljainkkal, kérünk, hogy oszd meg ismerőseiddel a videónkat és ezt a kampányoldalt.</p>
<p>Minden támogatást köszönünk!</p>

Mi a Szabad Pécs?
Független híroldal, ahol betartjuk a szakmailag megalapozott újságírás követelményeit és szeretünk műfajokkal kísérletezni. Elsősorban Pécsre, Baranyára, Dél-Dunántúlra koncentrálunk, de számos országos jelentőségű üggyel is foglalkoztunk, foglalkozunk.
Ahogy bizonyára Te is tudod, a független újságírás helyzete egyre nehezebb, ennek okait rengeteg helyen mások sokkal alaposabban leírták. A szélsőségesen torz magyar hirdetési piacon egyre kevesebb tisztességes kiadvány tud megélni. Már ott tartunk, hogy nagy múltú, nagy elérésű szakmai műhelyek is sokszor közvetlen olvasói támogatásra szorulnak. 
Mi is tennénk a dolgunkat, nem panaszkodunk, megoldást keresünk. Ennek egyik módja, hogy segítséget kérünk tőletek.
Segítsetek nekünk, hogy az elkövetkező évben nyugodtan dolgozhassunk!
Eddig is támogatásokból működött a Szabad Pécs (amit, ezúton is köszönünk), azonban ez ebben a formában már nem fenntartható. A rendes működéshez ennek a kampánynak a sikerére, hirdetési bevételekre, és pályázati finanszírozásra is szükség van. Mindhárom szempontból bizakodóak vagyunk. 

Mit kérünk? 
Ahhoz, hogy a munkakörülményeink az alapvető minimumoknak megfeleljenek számításaink szerint évente 13-15 millió forintra van szükség. Ebből nagyjából két főállású, egy mellékállású újságíró munkájának a költségeit, adminisztrációs, irodai, technikai és jogi költségeket tudnánk fedezni. A teljes összegnek kicsit több mint a felét, azaz kb. 8 millió forintot szeretnénk a segítségetekkel összegyűjteni.
Ha valamennyivel több jön össze, mint a kitűzött cél, akkor újabb, kisebb projekteket indítunk, hogy jobban elérjük a potenciális olvasóinkat. De konkrét terveink vannak arra az esetre  is, ha a kitűzött célunknál lényegesen több jön össze -- ebben az esetben újabb kiadványokat indítanánk az ország más régióiban.
Miért itt?

Az Indiegogo rengeteg hasonló projektnek segített már elindulni, fennmaradni. Azért választottuk a közösségi finanszírozásnak ezt a formáját, mert szeretnénk, ha a kampány eredménye nyilvános és átlátható lenne. Még akkor is, ha ennek költségei vannak.
Nehézségek?
Na, azok vannak.

Hogyan segíthetsz még?
Ha nem tudsz anyagilag hozzájárulni a kampányhoz, de egyetértesz a céljainkkal, kérünk, hogy oszd meg ismerőseiddel a videónkat és ezt a kampányoldalt.
Minden támogatást köszönünk!

*About Szabad Pécs*
Szabad Pécs (Free Pécs) is an independent, news site in Pécs, Hungary. We focus mainly on local, regional issues but we often have breaking news that enter the national news cycle. The site was founded in 2017 by ex-journalists of the daily Dunántúli Napló after Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's old friend Lőrinc Mészáros bought the publisher Mediaworks, one of Hungary's biggest media enterprises.
You can gather information about the desperate situation of press freedom in Hungary from many sources. The story of Szabad Pécs has been covered by several international news outlets including German, French, American, Finnish etc. sites.
We don't complain, we only would like to do our job. And we are looking for solutions.
The site was operated until now exclusively by micro donations, and we are very thankful for the support, but this model isn't sustainable anymore. That's why we ask for help.
What do we ask for?
According to our business plan we need about 50,000 USD (or 47,000 EUR) to cover the costs of 2 full time and 1 part time journalists, utilities, legal expenses etc. We ask for a little bit more than half of this amount during the campaign, since we believe that advertising and third party funding can help us with the other half.
What if we can collect more?
We would start new mini projects to reach our audience even better. And we have a plan for kickstarting similar outlets around Hungary if we can get significantly more funding.
Why Indiegogo?
Because it helped a lot of similar projects to achieve their goals. And we did choose this platform because its transparency and trustworthiness.
How you can help?
You can help us achieving our funding goal by donating as little as the price of a coffee, but we are also very thankful if you could share this campaign and our story.

<p>Ahora estamos aquí para que nos ayudes a conocerte en persona.</p>
<p>Para eso inventamos el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Y queremos que una de sus paradas sea la bella ciudad de <strong>Santiago</strong>, en <b>Chile</b>.</p>
<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour SANTIAGO</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <b>Santiago de Chile</b>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de <strong>Chile</strong> para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>
<p>A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.</p>
<h3>Por qué nosotros</h3>
<p>Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Snap Inc</strong>, <strong>Batanga Media</strong>, <strong>AOL</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>HLN</strong>, <strong>Univision</strong>,<strong> Discovery</strong>, <strong>NBC Universo</strong>, <strong>Mitú</strong>, <strong>Fullscreen</strong>, <strong>Clevver TV</strong>, <strong>Broadway Video</strong> y marcas como <strong>McDonalds</strong>, <strong>Bud Light</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Covergirl</strong>, <strong>Makeup Forever</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Target</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Johnny Walker</strong>, entre muchas otras.</p>

<p>Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.</p>
<p>Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.</p>
<p>Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.</p>
<p>Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong> a cada país.</p>
<p><strong>No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios</strong>, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.</p>
<h3>El problema</h3>
<p>Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.</p>
<p>Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...</p>
<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <strong>Santiago de Chile</strong> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos entre 600 y 850 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <strong>Chile</strong>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Santiago de Chile</strong> en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>
<h3><strong>El reto</strong></h3>
<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso <strong>debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días</strong>. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.</p>
<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>
<p>Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.</p>
<p>Tal vez no vives en <strong>Santiago de Chile</strong>, pero conoces a alguien que vive allá y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.</p>
<p>Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.</p>

<h3>Bella 2017</h3>
<p>Bella Caledonia offers fresh thinking for a new Scotland, a forum for challenging ideas giving space to new writers and engaging beyond the narrow confines of the echo chamber. Independence is a process not an event and we will only get there by independent thinking, solidarity and innovation.<br/><br/>We want to create more film and podcast content, and need to pay people to do that. We don't take advertising we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. That's why we need to ask for your help. Bella's takes a lot of time and hard work to produce. <br/><br/>We currently give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>quality daily articles from a  range of writers on Scottish politics and culture</li>
<li>weekly podcasts and music playlists</li>
<li>a range of content on social media platforms</li>
<li>a monthly print magazine</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499871633/wtkxaumgk2bauyix40hx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need your Support to Develop</h3>
<p>Here's what your support can achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding will be given to very specific projects: supporting a diversity of new writers whilst maintaining the very best analysis and commentary (all with very low overheads) </li>
<li>Build a platform that engages with other new media projects and campaigns, consolidating radical Scotland in one place</li>
<li>Reaching out beyond the echo-chamber to a wider and wider audiences</li>
<li>Creating a platform for film makers and artists to go beyond text to attention-grabbing film and artwork</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without your support the project can't continue. It's been maintained on a shoestring for several months now and desperately needs you to support it:</p>
<ul>
<li>We believe Bella is a crucial part of the media landscape which attracts readers from across the political divide through its quality of writing.</li>
<li>We have successfully built and expanded our readership over the past two years on a range of platforms and have been listed as the <a href=""http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2017/07/12/bella-is-growing-but-needs-your-support/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">top blog in Scotland  – and one of the top six in the UK. </a>
</li>
<li>Your support is vital - even a small amount would be appreciated.</li>

Bella Caledonia offers fresh thinking for a new Scotland, a forum for challenging ideas giving space to new writers and engaging beyond the narrow confines of the echo chamber. Independence is a process not an event and we will only get there by independent thinking, solidarity and innovation.We want to create more film and podcast content, and need to pay people to do that. We don't take advertising we want to keep our journalism as open as we can. That's why we need to ask for your help. Bella's takes a lot of time and hard work to produce. We currently give you:

quality daily articles from a  range of writers on Scottish politics and culture
weekly podcasts and music playlists
a range of content on social media platforms
a monthly print magazine


 

We Need your Support to Develop
Here's what your support can achieve:

The funding will be given to very specific projects: supporting a diversity of new writers whilst maintaining the very best analysis and commentary (all with very low overheads) 
Build a platform that engages with other new media projects and campaigns, consolidating radical Scotland in one place
Reaching out beyond the echo-chamber to a wider and wider audiences
Creating a platform for film makers and artists to go beyond text to attention-grabbing film and artwork


The Impact
Without your support the project can't continue. It's been maintained on a shoestring for several months now and desperately needs you to support it:

We believe Bella is a crucial part of the media landscape which attracts readers from across the political divide through its quality of writing.
We have successfully built and expanded our readership over the past two years on a range of platforms and have been listed as the top blog in Scotland  – and one of the top six in the UK.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a comic book writer, author, and screenwriter trying something new. For more than a year, I've had a story idea in my head that harkens back to my love of 80's science-fiction movies (ALIEN, ALIENS, THE TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS, THE THING), all of which were (and still are) major creative inspirations for me. </p>
<p>The story became DERELICT, which followed a ""Dirty Dozen"" style group of scientists and engineers -- all people at the end of their respective roads, each seeking redemption where they can find it. Their desperate straits lead them to accept a dangerous contract: explore a mysterious derelict spacecraft that has been found in an unexplored star system, unravel its mysteries, and bring it back to human space. </p>
<p>The frightening realities of what they find there, however, are not what any of them expect.</p>
<p>As the story formed, it wasn't something that seemed like a new novel (it felt like it should be more visceral than that) and it wasn't something I wanted to just sell as a script and be done with.</p>
<p>This is when the idea of doing the story as a narrative podcast occurred, which was very compelling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563242288/mpdnzjge7ref8gwmdon5.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>The most exciting part was the idea of being able to take an audience on a journey with the characters. With just creative imagination, sound (and your eyes closed) listeners can viscerally experience the exploration of the ship. And the fact that a majority of the story is told through the ""radio communications"" of the team, makes it feel all the more real, like you're listening in to events as they transpire. </p>
<p>We hope you as a fan of good science fiction, or just good stories in general, will help bring it to life...</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Thirty seven hours ago, the IWS Crichton discovered the remains of a derelict vessel in an unexplored star system. </p>
<p>Eleven hours ago, all contact with the Crichton and her crew was lost...​</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562339100/pc5pa45jthjifkq89bgf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When the galaxy's most powerful corporation discovers that the derelict ship belongs to them, they send the only people they can, a group of washed up engineers and scientists who would do anything to reconstruct their shambled lives.</p>
<p>Their objective: find out what happened to the crew of the Crichton, and bring the derelict back...at any cost.​</p>
<p>But, as they soon learn, there are some mysteries that should remain buried. And there are some things lost that should never be found.</p>
<h3>Where We Are</h3>
<p>We have recorded and produced the first episode from our first season, and it will officially premiere August 24th, at the Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention <a href=""https://www.bubonicon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bubonicon</a>, in Albuquerque, NM. But you can listen to it right now, using the video version in the media gallery at the top of this page, or by visiting the <a href=""http://www.derelictpodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DERELICT website</a>. </p>
<p>We recorded the first episode in my basement office, which was converted into a sound studio for episode one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563124073/wdtasjp3nqms1sjyoeox.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563242310/n7vsxwbswiz43x4outrq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While this served its purpose to get us where we are, to continue to do this story in the way it deserves to be done, we are going to need a few things...</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are asking for an initial investment budget of $30,000. But where does all that money go... </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562339315/qzrnyzfdfy04xfteh10a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Roughly half of the investment will help us form our production studio where we can record all our actors at once. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Five separate Rode based microphone stations, with sound dampening enclosures</li>
<li>A new USB audio processor that can handle that many stations</li>
<li>Sound proofing</li>
<li>Studio space rental, including utilities</li>
<li>All the little necessary odds and ends - cabling, headphones, speakers, mic stands, boom arms, script stands, lighting, storage, printing paper, chairs, desks, you get the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having this space will enable us to not only produce other seasons of DERELICT, but eventually other stories as well.</p>
<p>As far as the second half of the budget, any story is only as strong as the performers in it, so it's imperative that we cast accomplished actors and actresses. In my biased opinion, I would say we knocked it out of the park in this regard. You can read more about our amazing cast below, but the remainder of our budget will go to taking care of them. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of our actors are not local, and will require travel expenses for the production.</li>
<li>Our two actresses are Screen Actors Guild (SAG) members, which increases their pay rate significantly, and requires contributions to health care and the purchasing of production insurance. </li>
<li>Because we respect those pursuing artistic and creative lives and careers, we want to pay all of our actors the same rate as those who are SAG.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the budget allotted for our performers, we have other expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music and effects licensing and creation</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Craft services</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what do you get out of helping us make our goal? We have some great perks to contributing, no question, but the main thing you get is DERELICT itself.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are trying to do something pretty unique; bring exciting, high-concept, feature film level genre experiences to the audio format. If you're a fan of genre stories like the movies I mentioned above, you're going to love DERELICT. And you're going to want to see this story not just come into the world...but continue to grow and develop. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All I ask is that you listen to episode one yourself, and then see how you feel after that. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Cast and Team</h3>
<p>Everyone involved on this project is passionate about seeing it completed. Our actors have already traveled on their own expense to New Mexico to record the first episode, and deferred their own payments. It will happen one way or another, but you have an opportunity to help us make it happen in the best form possible.</p>

<h3>what we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">up until now, ash has been covering the cost of production for from field to skin's episodes from their own pocket, spending about 25% of their self-employed full-time working hours doing unpaid labour and paying for travel, recording equipment, and other costs without receiving compensation. broken down, those costs amount to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 per distance interview (facetime, gmail chats, etc.)</li>
<li>$1500 per in-person interview (traveling to visit producers at their workspace/home)</li>
</ul>
<p>while there are some locations in canada that will require larger funding through government bodies (flights to nunavut from ash's home base in winnipeg average over $2000 round-trip), most locations are more easily accessible, and by batching travel to allow for visiting as many producers within a similar area as possible, ash is able to create additional content - the annual <a href=""https://www.fromfieldtoskin.com/search?q=forage"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>forage</i> collection</a> connects with producers in a smaller region to provide additional context to how fibresheds are able to work together and support one another, while one-off episodes allow different regions and types of producers to be highlighted. </p>
<p><strong>the $3000 goal </strong>will allow ash to conduct two new in-person interviews, which ash has already identified and will be moving forward with in the event that funding comes through. if we make less than the goal, episodes will be determined based on how much money is collected and which type of episode (distance or in-person) is the best option. </p>
<p><strong>as a stretch goal, ash hopes to raise $5000,</strong> which would come close enough to covering their expenses and labour to fund 2020's <a href=""https://www.fromfieldtoskin.com/search?q=forage"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>forage</i> collection</a>, which will be focused on ktaqmkuk in mi'kma'ki, organized with the help of megan samms of <a href=""http://livetextiles.online/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">live textiles</a>, who was interviewed in <a href=""https://www.fromfieldtoskin.com/interviews/2019/9/13/episode-fourteen-live-textiles?rq=forage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">episode fourteen</a>. additional funds between or above these goals will go towards funding additional episodes. there are currently 93 producers on the map and only 16 episodes have been produced, so there are at least 77 more potential episodes even without adding new members to the map!</p>
<p><strong>there are perks ranging from $5-$2000</strong>, so truly a range to fit nearly every budget! whether you just want a casual thank you, are interested in locally sourced and spun fleece-specific yarns, want a hot cup of tea and herbal skincare, would love a wooly weaving or poster for your wall or quilt on your lap, or even a say in where a future episode gets filmed, there are beautiful intentionally made sustainable gifts to fit any home. feel free to contact ash with any questions you may have if you feel pulled between multiple perk options.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>why is this important?</h3>
<p>with the current climate crisis hitting the headlines around the world, we can no longer ignore the impact we are having on our planet. while local production does not automatically guarantee an ethical or sustainable product, it is exponentially easier to investigate and connect with local producers than large multi-national corporations, and also shrinks your carbon footprint just by the sheer proximity. investing in local economies also makes it easier to support small producers in implementing climate-beneficial practices across their supply chains and practices. </p>
<p>for producers, the chance to be highlighted through an interview is even more beneficial. i've already heard from past interviewees who have made new sales as a direct result of their interview. while exposure doesn't pay the bills, sales as a direct result of exposure are pretty great. </p>
<p>on a larger scale, if we got more people following this project and connecting with their fibresheds, we could use those numbers to press government and private industry to invest in the areas where we see gaps - processing mills to create linen and hemp cloth, more grants for small businesses and farms looking to transition their methods to multi-use and climate-beneficial practices, investing in natural dye gardens producing on commercial levels, and highlighting more stories about local textile economies in the press and through cultural media so that the wider public learns about why local fibresheds are so vital. ⁠</p>
</div><div>
<h3>what's the risk?</h3>
<p>why should you trust me to follow through on this project? my track record speaks for itself - in the past 22 months, i've released an average of <strong>one new episode every six weeks</strong>, and the only reason i need to pull back on that level of production is the basic fact that living under capitalism means i can't afford to keep donating all my time and resources when it means risking not covering my bills month-to-month. </p>
<p>the structure of this crowdfunding campaign is also designed to be flexible, whether we raise less than or more than the goal - each $1200 will mean one new distance interview, while $1500 will mean one new in-person interview. we will record interviews over 2020 according to the amount raised.</p>
<p>additionally, i'll be using the same content shared with this campaign to create a more focused corporate package, approaching patrons, government agencies, and corporations with like-minded values to support future episodes as well. the episodes funded through this campaign will help create a buffer while i pursue longer-term stable funding from these sources.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact of a Successful Campaign:</strong></p>
<p>By funding this project you will help ensure, first and foremost, that unique content remains available.  I don’t have to tell you that the media is becoming more and more homogeneous. Dirty Roots Radio provides a voice for unique, independent artists that aren’t heard regularly on “mainstream” radio.  It is my goal to introduce you to artists that live off the beaten path that you may not encounter anywhere else.</p>
<p>A listener once told me Dirty Roots Radio was a “shoulders down” experience.  A chance to forget about the stress and responsibilities of the world.  I strive to provide the Healin’ Feelin’ every week and to introduce you to some great music along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Please see additional details below, including information on Dirty Roots Radio, how your gift will be used, and other ways you can help.  You can view playlists from previous episodes of the Dirty Roots Radio Show, and listen to archived broadcasts at </strong><a href=""http://www.DirtyRootsRadio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.DirtyRootsRadio.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>Dirty Roots Radio is an old-school record show specializing in renegade country, raw blues, vintage gospel, greasy soul, punk, and funk.  I’ve been exploring the twisted roots and branches of American music on Dirty Roots Radio since 2006. </p>
<p>Dirty Roots features artists you recognize and many you’ve never heard before.  I pick the music in real time, creating the playlist as we go.  Almost nothing is pre-planned.  It’s all about the vibe. </p>
<p>The sound of Dirty Roots Radio has American roots music at its core – old blues, country, etc. – and includes new artists that bear the mark of those old influences.  We play well known legends; bizarre, obscure gems; and local/independent artists.</p>
<p>The show has always aired on WGRN 89.5 FM, the campus radio station for Greenville University, in Greenville, IL.  </p>
<p>The long-term future of WGRN is a bit uncertain.  In the short term, I’ve been hired by Greenville University to serve as the Operations Manager for the station.  I’m an adjunct professor and I work hard to corrupt…um, INSTRUCT…a group of students in running the station. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, this new opportunity has increased my personal workload and placed more stress on my schedule.  Add to that the fact that my daughter is growing up and becoming more involved in activities and time has become a very valuable commodity for me.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it is my hope that we can evolve Dirty Roots Radio from a once-a-week live radio show to a weekly podcast, created from my home studio as it fits my schedule. This new format will allow me to branch out a bit further with the show and create additional programming.</p>
<p>I intend to launch three separate podcasts, with an eye on a fourth in the near future:</p>
<p><u>DIRTY ROOTS</u></p>
<p><i>Dirty Roots would be the same show as it is on Thursday night, just presented in a podcast format rather than a live broadcast</i></p>
<p><u>THE OUTSKIRTS</u></p>
<p><i>The Outskirts will retain the trademark vibe and unpredictability of Dirty Roots, but with an intense focus on the country side of the musical spectrum.  Alternative or Insurgent Country artists, such as Scott H. Biram, Sarah Shook &amp; the Disarmers, and Jason &amp; the Scorchers will play nice with Dirty Roots staples like the Bottle Rockets, Social Distortion, and Marty Stuart &amp; His Fabulous Superlatives and country legends like Hank, Willie, Waylon, and Cash.  The Outskirts will confidently flirt with appropriate “mainstream country”…that is to say, we’ll dip one toe into the waters of the Billboard country chart and feature similarly-minded artists such as Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, and Eric Church to demonstrate how they all fit together. </i></p>
<p><u>VINYL EDITION</u></p>
<p><i>Dirty Roots: Vinyl Edition will be a short-form podcast that takes a weekly trip through my record collection.  The music on the other shows will come from a variety of mediums, but this one is all about vinyl.  I’ll share a handful of tracks each week and shine a spotlight on new vinyl releases, with a special emphasis on the unique and collectible (colored vinyl, etc.).</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL YOUR GIFT BE USED?</strong></p>
<p>Your financial contribution will be used to purchase new equipment and software to make home-recording of the Dirty Roots Radio Show possible.  I will need to purchase a microphone, speakers, recording/editing software, a higher-quality turntable, a small mixer, and possibly a laptop computer, along with cables and other necessary accessories.</p>
<p>Funding will also be used to upgrade the Dirty Roots website to better accommodate this new way of sharing the show and to cover annual website fees and the annual cost of Podomatic’s hosting services, allowing me to upload the shows.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about the expenses associated with the show and/or the equipment I’m looking at purchasing, you may contact me directly at <a href=""mailto:dirtyroots@rocketmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dirtyroots@rocketmail.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>In addition to your kind gift – or, if you’re not able to give, instead of a financial contribution – please share this campaign on all of your social media accounts and email it to like-minded friends and music fans.  Mention it whenever possible and help us get the word out!</p>

A listener once told me Dirty Roots Radio was a “shoulders down” experience.  A chance to forget about the stress and responsibilities of the world.  I strive to provide the Healin’ Feelin’ every week and to introduce you to some great music along the way.
Please see additional details below, including information on Dirty Roots Radio, how your gift will be used, and other ways you can help.  You can view playlists from previous episodes of the Dirty Roots Radio Show, and listen to archived broadcasts at www.DirtyRootsRadio.com.
 
OUR STORY
Dirty Roots Radio is an old-school record show specializing in renegade country, raw blues, vintage gospel, greasy soul, punk, and funk.  I’ve been exploring the twisted roots and branches of American music on Dirty Roots Radio since 2006. 
Dirty Roots features artists you recognize and many you’ve never heard before.  I pick the music in real time, creating the playlist as we go.  Almost nothing is pre-planned.  It’s all about the vibe. 
The sound of Dirty Roots Radio has American roots music at its core – old blues, country, etc. – and includes new artists that bear the mark of those old influences.  We play well known legends; bizarre, obscure gems; and local/independent artists.
The show has always aired on WGRN 89.5 FM, the campus radio station for Greenville University, in Greenville, IL.  
The long-term future of WGRN is a bit uncertain.  In the short term, I’ve been hired by Greenville University to serve as the Operations Manager for the station.  I’m an adjunct professor and I work hard to corrupt…um, INSTRUCT…a group of students in running the station. 
As you can imagine, this new opportunity has increased my personal workload and placed more stress on my schedule.  Add to that the fact that my daughter is growing up and becoming more involved in activities and time has become a very valuable commodity for me.
With all this in mind, it is my hope that we can evolve Dirty Roots Radio from a once-a-week live radio show to a weekly podcast, created from my home studio as it fits my schedule. This new format will allow me to branch out a bit further with the show and create additional programming.
I intend to launch three separate podcasts, with an eye on a fourth in the near future:
DIRTY ROOTS
Dirty Roots would be the same show as it is on Thursday night, just presented in a podcast format rather than a live broadcast
THE OUTSKIRTS
The Outskirts will retain the trademark vibe and unpredictability of Dirty Roots, but with an intense focus on the country side of the musical spectrum.  Alternative or Insurgent Country artists, such as Scott H. Biram, Sarah Shook & the Disarmers, and Jason & the Scorchers will play nice with Dirty Roots staples like the Bottle Rockets, Social Distortion, and Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives and country legends like Hank, Willie, Waylon, and Cash.  The Outskirts will confidently flirt with appropriate “mainstream country”…that is to say, we’ll dip one toe into the waters of the Billboard country chart and feature similarly-minded artists such as Chris Stapleton, Miranda Lambert, and Eric Church to demonstrate how they all fit together. 
VINYL EDITION
Dirty Roots: Vinyl Edition will be a short-form podcast that takes a weekly trip through my record collection.  The music on the other shows will come from a variety of mediums, but this one is all about vinyl.  I’ll share a handful of tracks each week and shine a spotlight on new vinyl releases, with a special emphasis on the unique and collectible (colored vinyl, etc.).
 
HOW WILL YOUR GIFT BE USED?
Your financial contribution will be used to purchase new equipment and software to make home-recording of the Dirty Roots Radio Show possible.  I will need to purchase a microphone, speakers, recording/editing software, a higher-quality turntable, a small mixer, and possibly a laptop computer, along with cables and other necessary accessories.
Funding will also be used to upgrade the Dirty Roots website to better accommodate this new way of sharing the show and to cover annual website fees and the annual cost of Podomatic’s hosting services, allowing me to upload the shows.
If you would like to know more about the expenses associated with the show and/or the equipment I’m looking at purchasing, you may contact me directly at dirtyroots@rocketmail.com.
 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
In addition to your kind gift – or, if you’re not able to give, instead of a financial contribution – please share this campaign on all of your social media accounts and email it to like-minded friends and music fans.  Mention it whenever possible and help us get the word out!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>Why Wonderment?</h2>
<p>Today, finding news, articles, and images, and then sharing those interests with others, requires several steps and multiple Internet sites. Wonderment removes those steps and brings that information directly to you, in one spot, and allows you to share that information with your friends and family.</p>
<p>Sharing with friends and family is one of our core values. One of the connecting pieces of the friendship between our friendship is sharing what excites us, thus allowing us to discover more about the world around us. We became friends through our shared love of Disney and Disneyland, specifically. We would eagerly pass any news we could find back and forth to each other. Bonding over that topic is what formed the foundation of our friendship and now, our company.</p>
<p>At Wonderment, we believe that everyone has something that electrifies them. Whether it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locating your next adventure and travel destination;</li>
<li>Learning more about your favorite automobiles and how to maintain and/or restore them;</li>
<li>Discovering that interesting new DIY project;</li>
<li>Uncovering your next favorite book; or</li>
<li>Finding the resources to start your own small business,</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has something that fascinates them.</p>
<p>We also believe that sharing is part of the joy of having a passion. When we have an interest, we want others to know about it. After all, part of the fun of finding the greatest restaurant is taking your friends there!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488599650/m3kl8mdpjoxvo8slye1s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>yourwonderment.com Home Page Screen Shot</i></p>
<p>Wonderment supports these beliefs with a site that has multiple categories spanning a wide range of topics. Learning more about your interest is as simple as clicking “Add.” Likewise, sharing what you find is just as easy! With Facebook and Twitter sharing available, you can ensure your friends and family will be able to <u>discover more</u> along with you.</p>
<p>To help make this site a reality, we are looking for people to share with us. What is it that you can share? Why, your support (and funds), of course! We have several different funding levels that you can participate in. To make it even <u>easier</u> for you to partner with us, we have very cool perks attached to each funding level. Our goal was to make the perks unique and practical, like the site, and like us! Each perk represents not only Wonderment, but are as unique as we are. So take a moment, watch our video, look over the perks, and join with us. Help make this site a reality and help yourself and others <u>discover more</u>. After all, Wonderment is <u>your passions, your interests, your way.</u></p>
</div><div>
<h2>Our Goals</h2>
<p>We are currently looking for funding to help us enhance Wonderment. As you can see from the helpful link we've provided, we have the live site nearly ready to launch. However, we have two projects in the works which will increase your experience with Wonderment: </p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a Mobile App to help you <u>discover more</u> on the go and,</li>
<li>Increased functionality to provide fresh content.</li>
</ul>
<p> The money we receive during this campaign will help to cover the costs of these two enhancements. We are excited about these enhancements and want to make them a reality.</p>
<p>For example, the promoted links tie in with our goal of helping everyone find new and interesting information about the world around them. Promoting sites within Wonderment offers bloggers, and others, who create fresh and intriguing content, the ability to reach new audiences. Plus, it allows everyone at Wonderment to find that great new writer or photographer that they just HAVE to tell their friends about!</p>
<p>Even with our awesome perks, listed below, it is possible that we may not reach our goal. If that does happen, the funds raised will still be used to develop the mobile app and promoted links. However every bit helps move us closer to our goal.</p>

<p>I have a comprehensive background in team development and project management. I thrive on taking on product ideas and streamlining efficiency. Some examples include:</p>

<p>Without motivation &amp; leadership, teams would not be as productive. As a project manager, I have found creative ways to motivate diverse teams into collaborating &amp; problem solving. This is done through listening first, determining root cause analysis and guiding the team to meaningful solutions.  There is also maintenance that has to be done to ensure that the changes are implemented as well as determining any additional blockers.</p>

As part of our mission, we provide a platform for artists, teachers, and thought leaders to share their ideas and insight in person at the Sacred Stream Center and online. Our Artist & Lecture series has already brought many thought leaders, artists, and healers to the Sacred Stream Center, including author and scholar, Robert Thurman, the Dalai Lama’s English translator Thupten Jinpa, spiritual teacher Matthew Fox, Enneagram scholar Helen Palmer, Grammy nominees Liz Story, Barbara Higbie, and Lisa Lynne, The Marin Chamber Singers, internationally acclaimed Sarod master Rajeev Taranath, and many more.One of our goals is to preserve this wisdom and culture for the future, and to share these events with the world for free. Our Video Archival Project is already underway, but the costs far exceed our capacity as a small non-profit to produce and distribute. Total production and post-productions costs per 60-minute video are, on average, $5000. However, with many of our projects, we have already completed filming and just need help financing the editing and rendering before releasing them on our YouTube channel.Our limited budget has only allowed us to produce about a tenth of the content that we have already begun. For just a few thousand dollars per project, we can continue our efforts. If you have enjoyed our free videos in the past, or think that you might benefit from them in the future, or you just want to participate in something worthwhile that helps others, you can make a big difference by making any size donation now.Anything that you contribute to this important project – no matter how small – will go a long way to helping us meet our goal.Thank you for your consideration and support. Gift DescriptionsThank You: Optional Facebook or Twitter shout-out.Khata: A beautiful Tibetan ceremonial scarf decorated with the eight auspicious symbols of Tibetan Buddhism. Meditation on Light (Download): For defining, clearing and recharging your body’s subtle energy system, this meditation helps with burn-out, energy drain, and cultivating the overall health of body, mind, and spirit. Eco-Friendly Flash Drive: With a stunning natural hardwood shell made from certified eco-friendly European Maple Wood, these Sacred Stream branded flash drives are the perfect blend of modern technology and sophisticated styling.Tibetan Prayer Flags (Set of 5): These popular prayer flags are handmade in Nepal and include 5 sets of 10 flags each.

Matthew Fox, in full. This is the first and only time Bob and Matt have shared a stage and it is delightful, humorous, and filled with insight.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hi, we are <strong>Steve Anderson and Mathew McCabe</strong>, two long-time youth pastors in Maryland. We serve at two different medium-sized churches in our area. We aren't special or superstars by any means, but we have been great friends for more than a dozen years and we've both been in youth ministry for nearly 30 years. We are passionate about Student Ministry, and we care deeply for those who have answered the call to be a part of the tribe called ""Youth Workers."" As youth ministry ""veterans,"" we talked for a couple years about ways we could encourage more youth workers to stay in the game for the long haul. We finally saw our dreams come to fruition in January of this year when we started the <strong>""Youth Ministry Sherpas Podcast.""</strong></p>
<p>We chose the name because it represents what we are about. Sherpas are mountain people. You've probably read about them in great mountaineering stories. Sherpas know their terrain and are acclimated to the climate. Sherpas shoulder other's burdens along the trail so they can survive and thrive. Sherpas are essential for completing the journey.</p>
<p>We started from scratch. We scraped together some money for a website, microphone, logos, and stickers to give away. We read up on how to do a podcast. We created all our social media accounts. And then we recorded. And recorded. And recorded. In fact, we've made 24 full-length episodes in just 7 months, plus 26 mini-episodes we called Sherpa Shorts. We've built a small following, and are having a blast doing it. Our podcast is two friends having a conversation, laughing a lot, telling stories about youth ministry success and failure, and encouraging others to keep going.</p>
<p>Which is what we plan to do! We want to take our podcast to another level. But we need your help, and we need some capital. That's where this campaign comes in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<h3><strong>Help us get to the National Youth Workers Convention!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We are planning to represent ourselves at the National Youth Worker Convention in St. Louis this November. There will be 4500 youth workers there! We need to cover vendor fees, create a dynamic display booth, and buy promotional stuff to give away so people will remember us.</li>
<li>We are buying new equipment so we can improve our audio quality and record online interviews with great youth ministry guests! We already have some amazing ones lined up.</li>
<li>If we don't meet our goal, we will do what we have always done--figure out a way to make it work with what we have! Hey, we're youth pastors---we go with the flow.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The more youth workers we can encourage to stay in the game for the long haul, the better shape youth ministry will be in. The better shape youth ministry is in, the more students who will be impacted with the life changing message of Jesus. </p>

Audio drama inspired by Heyer’s life
Music from the incomparable Emma Gatrill plus original music composed especially for the podcast
 Why do we need your help?Editing/production costs - Heyer Today is a much more ambitious project than The Sugar Baby Confessionals. We have over 60 hours of audio to edit and produce, having interviewed over 39 people. Scriptwriting/voice casting - We want to create audio drama to create to bring Heyer’s life and work to your ears in a vivid way.Marketing - As a small team of two people (with some friends helping out) we do all our promotion ourselves. Your contributions will help us to market our work and create a buzz to generate more listeners. We’ve managed more than 31,000 downloads for season 1, and hope to keep our momentum going strong - but we can't do it without you!Music - We really wanted to create an original soundscape so, apart from amazing music from Emma Gattrill, we’re writing an original score of piano and harpsichord based music (Regency instruments).This is also our longest season yet, at 24 episodes, and we need your help to give us the time to lavish on our work.All this work, which we love, will be totally free and available on as many platforms as possible, so any donations you can make will buy us time to craft our podcast into something we can all be proud of.By supporting our crowdfunder, you’ll get:
The satisfaction of supporting an indie podcast company with a proven track record of excellence 
Be an intrinsic part of our team – we can’t do it without you!

What We Need
We're looking to raise $3,000 US. Here's where it will go:


Actors: We believe representation matters as much as talent, and we want to be able to provide our actors more than our undying gratitude. We want to be able to pay our actors a decent wage for their work, and help them further their own careers. 

Writing, Editing, and Maintenance: Writing and producing are pretty time consuming, and we also work full-time. The money allows us to invest in technology, hosting, and time to create, edit, and get these stories out to you in a timely fashion.

With Your Help

We'll continue to tell stories featuring protagonists from all walks of life that don't often see themselves in those narratives.
We are going to be able to grow our audience, which will make the interactive polls between episodes more dramatic (more voting raises the stakes).
Together, we'll create interactive stories that hold up long after the voting is done.


Risks & Challenges
We're undertaking this, knowing there is a huge glut of these right now, and we know the COVID-19, calls for justice for BIPOC, and the civil unrest in the United States has many people wondering why they should give money to a fiction series when there are people needing money everywhere.

Aimee is intrigued when a pancake she makes looks just like Jesus, until she realizes something truly profound and dangerous is at work. *******The first season of Jesus Pancake includes 32 characters, almost 4 hours of content, original music, and lots of quirkiness. Forty two artists will be involved in this production (including production staff, designers, writers, and actors). Like all of our audio content, Jesus Pancake will be available for free via all podcast platforms. If you like audio fiction and like to pay the artists who make it, please contribute. In return, we will make awesome and compelling audio content for you to enjoy!Thanks to a generous grant from Manbites Dog Theater Fund, we are 1/3 of the way toward our funding goal. We need your assistance to make it the rest of the way! We'd be grateful if you support our campaign with dollars, sharing this page, and spreading the good word far and wide about Artist Soapbox and the work we do. Jesus Pancake is the fourth audio fiction project produced by Artist Soapbox. We released Master Builder in 2019, The New Colossus in 2020, and the Declaration of Love audio anthology in 2020. Due to its length and complexity, Jesus Pancake would be our most ambitious project yet!Season One of Jesus Pancake, our newest original audio drama serial was written by the Soapbox Audio Collective Team One (Tamara Kissane, Mara Thomas, Katy Koop, Juliana Finch).  The co-producers and co-directors for this project are Aurelia Belfield and Tamara Kissane.Episodes 1-3 of Jesus Pancake were workshopped at University Theatre at NC State in September 2019. The writers conducted a Zoom reading in summer 2020 and have completed the second round of edits. We have begun the pre-production work (casting, scheduling, rehearsing) with a plan to record in person in the studio in late fall 2021.We estimate we will need 4-5 rehearsals and about 20 hours of studio time.  Jesus Pancake will be released to the public when all nine episodes are completely sound designed. WHAT IS THE MONEY FOR?Paying the people! Only about $2000 of this campaign will go to non-people (hosting and website, marketing, catering, etc). The rest of the funds raised will go to pay artists in our community. The more we raise, the more we can pay them for their awesome hard work. WOULD YOU LIKE A TASTE?It's a pre-celebration to get everyone excited about the Jesus Pancake that's to come!!Announcing: ASBX Audio Shorts ~~ six original audio pieces written and performed by NC creatives ~~ specifically contributed to aid in fundraising for JP.

<p>We make Digital Media, usually for free, to the benefit of local artists. But Digital Media is expensive.</p>
<p>We get most things second hand or discounted. This mic? We found it in my mom’s attic. This camera? It was the display model at Best Buy. </p>
<p>We’re expanding our video capacity. We’re currently self-producing a documentary video series, but we dream big. We want to do bigger and better.<br/>That’s why we’re starting the Scapi Tech Fund. We’re raising $2100 for the newest 4k DJI drone on the market and a robust portable audio system, the ZOOM H6 with lavalier microphones. We can get both of these for $2100, and it will revolutionize the way we work.</p>
<p>Most of the time, shelling out this amount of money for technology has diminishing returns. A big price tag doesn’t always mean a huge leap in quality. That’s why when we shell out big money for tech, we go for function.</p>
<p>The DJI drone is reliable, its innovative zoom technology allows for DYNAMIC shooting, and its internal systems will greatly prevent damage to the machine.</p>
<p>The Zoom setup will complement our portable audio setup in a major way, and will become our new portable mixer. 4 XLR inputs means we can get near studio quality leveling on the go. Its built-in microphone combined with our currently owned zoom products means we’ll be able to set up multiple mics without having to bust out XLR if the situation calls for it.</p>
<p>So, that’s why we’re doing this. We want to make groundbreaking digital content to spotlight the artists of Chicago. If that’s not for you, feel free to move on.

<p>Tides is a science fiction audio drama about life in extreme circumstances. It follows biologist Dr. Winifred Eurus, a member of the first manned expedition to Fons, an Earth-like moon wracked by extreme tidal waves due to its orbit around a nearby gas giant. When surveying ocean life her submarine is destroyed, leaving her alone to walk to higher ground before the wave comes back.

<p>Rudyard and Antigone Funn run the oldest, and only, funeral home on the island of Piffling. They provide terrible funerals in which the schedule outranks the mourners and there's always the risk of someone throwing a punch. When Eric Chapman sets up a parlour across the square and provides joyful celebrations of the deceased's lives, happy memories (and a bowling alley), the Funns can't compete. Their business drains away and they are riven with envy.</p>

<p><i>Wooden Overcoats</i> is a podcast sitcom which launched in the Autumn of 2015. In Summer 2020, the fourth and final season will finish the story.</p>
<p>Over the series, we've listened to Funn Funerals (attempt to) compete with Chapman's and heard the effect on the wider village, seen Rudyard repeatedly try to undermine his rival, Antigone learn what it is to step outdoors, Georgie find a family she can call her own. With your help, in Season Four we will solve the show's great mystery: <i>Why did Eric Chapman come to Piffling Vale?</i></p>

<p><i>Wooden Overcoats</i> launched with the idea that it's possible to make a professional audio sitcom independently. We hire studios, actors, writers, directors, producers, a production manager, a PR manager, a composer, an artist, and the Piffling Philharmonic aka our orchestra.</p>
<p>Support from our listeners is vital to ensure these professionals are paid fairly for their time and talents. The full season will cost more than £25,000 to make. We have been working hard to raise the rest of our budget through live shows and sponsorship here in the UK, but we need help from our listeners to close the gap.</p>
<p>This is the last season. In consequence, this is our last fundraiser. If you have ever considered donating to <i>Wooden Overcoats </i>but have not had the opportunity before, now is the time. This is the one.</p>

</div></div>","Support the campaign to finish the stories of Rudyard, Antigone, Eric, Georgie, and Piffling Vale.

Wooden Overcoats tells the story of rival funeral parlours on an island in the English Channel.
Rudyard and Antigone Funn run the oldest, and only, funeral home on the island of Piffling. They provide terrible funerals in which the schedule outranks the mourners and there's always the risk of someone throwing a punch. When Eric Chapman sets up a parlour across the square and provides joyful celebrations of the deceased's lives, happy memories (and a bowling alley), the Funns can't compete. Their business drains away and they are riven with envy.

Wooden Overcoats is a podcast sitcom which launched in the Autumn of 2015. In Summer 2020, the fourth and final season will finish the story.
Over the series, we've listened to Funn Funerals (attempt to) compete with Chapman's and heard the effect on the wider village, seen Rudyard repeatedly try to undermine his rival, Antigone learn what it is to step outdoors, Georgie find a family she can call her own. With your help, in Season Four we will solve the show's great mystery: Why did Eric Chapman come to Piffling Vale?

Season 3 Episode 3 Cast & Crew © Odinn Orn Hilmarsson


Season One of Wooden Overcoats was eight episodes long. 
Season Two was eight episodes and a backers-only Christmas Special. 
Season Three was eight episodes and a backers-only Summer Special. 
For Season Four, we are asking £15,000 to make a bumper TEN EPISODE season.

Wooden Overcoats launched with the idea that it's possible to make a professional audio sitcom independently. We hire studios, actors, writers, directors, producers, a production manager, a PR manager, a composer, an artist, and the Piffling Philharmonic aka our orchestra.
Support from our listeners is vital to ensure these professionals are paid fairly for their time and talents. The full season will cost more than £25,000 to make. We have been working hard to raise the rest of our budget through live shows and sponsorship here in the UK, but we need help from our listeners to close the gap.
This is the last season. In consequence, this is our last fundraiser. If you have ever considered donating to Wooden Overcoats but have not had the opportunity before, now is the time. This is the one.

If we hit out stretch goal of £17,000 we will make a backers-only holiday special. Every donor, no matter what you contributed, will get a copy of Rudyard Ruins Hallowe'en. We had so much fun making and releasing the Christmas and Summer specials thanks to our listeners' generosity. We hope you will help us add one more to the set.

During this fundraiser, we will release a new mini-series of Funn Fragments. Over five weeks, we'll drop five new episodes by writers from all over podcasting:

<li>For several years I have been toying around with the idea of starting a podcast. In the 2018 thanks to the encouragement from my role model in podcasting Joe Rogan and my lovely girlfriend Cristina I got started. In learning more about podcasting and other media platforms I learned about Gary Vaynerchuk and Voicecon.

<li>En 2013 fundé junto a otros estudiantes y amigos de la Universidad José Simeón Cañas, UCA una organización ecologista denominada Somos Tutal, vinculada a la conciencia ecológica y a la consecuente lucha social, esta organización sigue viva a la fecha con diferente administración.</li>
<li>En 2013 contribuimos junto a mi ex-novio, a crear el primer circo social en una comunidad de alto riesgo en El Salvador: Vacilarte. El proyecto aún está vivo gracias al apoyo de diversas organizaciones no gubernamentales y el arduo trabajo de la comunidad.</li>
<li>En 2013 fui elegida como presidenta estudiantil de la Facultad de Humanidades de la UCA, durante mi gestión realicé junto con el equipo, la campaña de identidad “Yosoyuca”.</li>
<li>En 2014 desarrollé junto con colegas un programa de empoderamiento femenino a través del arte y bisutería en la Isla Tasajera, la Paz. El proyecto continúa y lo pueden encontrar como ‘Artesanas’ (son las que decoraran una de las recompensas).</li>
<li>En 2014 formé parte del primer grupo de mujeres malabaristas “Buruka colectiva”</li>
<li>En 2015 formé parte del grupo de Stand Up Comedy “ComediaEs”, dirigido por Fernando Rodríguez y producido por Grupo Caverna donde realicé y presenté mi propio material cómico. La comedia sigue viva en mis videos.</li>

En 2013 fundé junto a otros estudiantes y amigos de la Universidad José Simeón Cañas, UCA una organización ecologista denominada Somos Tutal, vinculada a la conciencia ecológica y a la consecuente lucha social, esta organización sigue viva a la fecha con diferente administración.
En 2013 contribuimos junto a mi ex-novio, a crear el primer circo social en una comunidad de alto riesgo en El Salvador: Vacilarte. El proyecto aún está vivo gracias al apoyo de diversas organizaciones no gubernamentales y el arduo trabajo de la comunidad.
En 2013 fui elegida como presidenta estudiantil de la Facultad de Humanidades de la UCA, durante mi gestión realicé junto con el equipo, la campaña de identidad “Yosoyuca”.
En 2014 desarrollé junto con colegas un programa de empoderamiento femenino a través del arte y bisutería en la Isla Tasajera, la Paz. El proyecto continúa y lo pueden encontrar como ‘Artesanas’ (son las que decoraran una de las recompensas).
En 2014 formé parte del primer grupo de mujeres malabaristas “Buruka colectiva”
En 2015 formé parte del grupo de Stand Up Comedy “ComediaEs”, dirigido por Fernando Rodríguez y producido por Grupo Caverna donde realicé y presenté mi propio material cómico. La comedia sigue viva en mis videos.
2016 Trabaje para mejorar la calidad del cuidado infantil en El Salvador en una organización no gubernamental pero con alianza con el gobierno.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dave and Ethan constantly talk about Weird Al for hours at a time. It’s not unusual for them to be on the phone discussing Al into the wee hours of the morning, so it was kind of a natural progression to start up a podcast. Their conversations would be fun for anyone with the appropriate level of nerdiness, and they want to share them with you. And as much as this podcast is an outlet for Dave and Ethan, it’s meant to be one for you, too. Our goal is not only to entertain you, but also to engage you in conversation!</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>About Us</h3></div>
<p>Dave ""Elvis"" Rossi &amp; Ethan Ullman are two of the biggest Weird Al fans in the world!   </p>
<p>You may recognize Dave as the fan who got Al the Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and raised the necessary $40,000 to pay for it. He is also known for his extensive Weird Al collection, his Weird Al tattoos, and soon will be known for this podcast!</p>
<p>Ethan is amassing an impressive Weird Al collection of his own, as well as spending time as a comedian and comedy radio show host, having interviewed Jimmy Fallon, Tracy Morgan, Marc Maron, Kate Flannery, Awkwafina, Margaret Cho, and even Weird Al himself.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Besides paying off our professionally recorded podcast theme and professionally drawn podcast logo, there is equipment that we need to purchase to make our podcast sound great, and fees associated with hosting and streaming the podcast to you.  We are happy to absorb some of these costs ourselves, but it does add up.</p>
<p>We realize that our goal is ambitious.  We are just asking that if you can help us keep costs down, please do.  Either way, we hope you listen and enjoy the podcast as much as we enjoy making it!</p>
<p>For those who are able to help, we have some amazing perks to share with you!  On top of autographed pictures from Al himself, rare out-of-print tour passes, and hard-to-find promotional material from <i>UHF</i>,<i> </i>we are digging deep into their personal collections to bring you amazing items you can't live with out.   And if physical perks aren't your thing, you can sit in on a podcast with us, or get exclusive access to digital perks.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our podcast will feature current news and events, discussions about rare collectibles and songs, and interviews with celebrity fans and people relevant to Al-related projects.  </p>
<p>We're not taking the decision to raise funds lightly.  We are both passionate fans, and would do pretty much anything for Al.  Dave's passion helped get Al his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  All the money raised for Al's Star came from you guys, the fans, so we know the power Al's fans hold!  We sincerely believe in this podcast and we hope you do too!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it, some people just can't contribute financially.  But that doesn't mean you still can't help.  Please share our campaign with your family and friends and anyone else you think might be interested.  You never know who is an Al fan until you ask.</p>
<p>Also, please listen and subscribe to our podcast.  It really means a lot to us to know that we are reaching Al's fans.  There's details how to subscribe and follow us on social media on our website <a href=""http://www.2000inch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2000inch.com</a></p>

<div><h3>Stretch Goals</h3></div>
<p>$2,000</p>
<p>At this level, we have covered the expenses we’d already put into making <i>Dave &amp; Ethan’s 2000” Weird Al Podcast</i> the best podcast ever, plus we will be able to continue commissioning amazing artists and musicians for fun artwork, original songs and more!</p> <p>$2,666</p>
<p>But If we collectively reach our $2000 goal + $666 we will commission a very special ""Extra Gory Version"" of our theme song! What does it mean to have an ""Extra Gory Version"" of our theme song? We don't know either, but we'd so much love to find out!</p> <p>$40,000</p>
<p>If we raise $40,000, we will attempt to get <i>Dave &amp; Ethan’s 2000” Weird Al Podcast</i> a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

<h3>What is ""Omegaman""?</h3>
<p>Omegaman is an audio drama about super heroes, villains, and those caught in between. The first half of Season 1 takes place mostly within a prison specifically designed for super-villains, and follows Jennifer Jeanne, a reporter on a mission to uncover a secret conspiracy within the ranks of those who were mostly all placed there by Omegaman. </p>
<h3>The first seven episodes are free!</h3>
<p>You can check out the first seven episodes online at <a href=""http://www.omegamanpodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.omegamanpodcast.com</a> or wherever you download podcasts. I hope that the cliff-hanger of an ending will leave you wanting more. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first 7 episodes were paid for out of pocket by me, Jason Chao, the writer, director, and editor of Omegaman. But I need more funding to help finish the season and attempt another. Much of the cost is to help feed my family while I write, record, and edit, but also to help pay the actors and crew what they are worth and to be able to access the tools and libraries to really make the audio drama come alive. </p>
<p>What you get is the advancement of the story that hopefully you already like.  And if you give extra, you may even score a cameo in an upcoming episode. </p>
<p>Our current perk levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 donation = I'll include your name  in the show notes of each episode and online at our website.</li>
<li>$50 donation = previous perk as well as a 1 week exclusive sneak peak when the rest of the season drops. </li>
<li>$100 donation = Previous perk as well as your name will be credited by me at the end of every episode for the remainder of season 1.</li>
<li>$200 donation = You will be credited with a special thanks at the beginning of every episode in the remainder of season 1 (which you can voice record your name yourself).</li>
<li>$300+ donation = All of the previous perks as well as a minimum one-line cameo in one of the upcoming episodes. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't wish to be credited, please let me know and I will keep you anonymous. </p>
<h3>What I can do with each of our goals:</h3>
<p>For each of our goals, I can gauge the interest in the show and spend time and resources accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>$4000 - Finish Season 1 and call it a day. I have an idea for a ending that will take around 3-4 episodes more. It will conclude Omegaman. </li>
<li>$6000 - Finish Season 1 on a budget and leave room for Season 2. This will be about another 7 episodes. The budget will come from the fact that I won't be adding many more character and also will be keeping sound effects free and simple.</li>
<li>$8000 - previous one but just better. I can get more actors to fill in some of the roles that we haven't heard from yet (Warden Jeffries, William and Anikka Gaines, and more) and also gain access to higher quality recording equipment and sound libraries. </li>
<li>$10,000+ - Everything and more. I will probably start writing season 2. I really doubt I'll get here so if I do, I'll have to think about more of what I can do</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The wonder and cost of audio dramas</h3>
<p>I personally love audio dramas because of the potential of imagination that they can inspire. Audio has the power to unlock our own vivid dreams to fill in fantastical visuals that would be unachievable on such a small budget. For film, if I wanted a helicopter, then I'd have to rent a helicopter. For audio, I can just cut in the sound of a helicopter and your brain fills in the rest. The budget therefore for audio dramas goes to the time that it takes to make it, and the tools and the actors who can really help bring it to life. </p>
<p>For the first seven episodes, most of the actors took far below what they are worth because they loved the story or did it as favors to me and my producer, Selah Victor. But as a Christian and a man of integrity, I would love to be able to pay them suitably for their time and talent. I also have a family to feed. The first seven episodes took about 3 months of writing, recording, and editing and I would love to be able to dedicate my time to helping bring season 1 to full fruition. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially there are some powerful ways you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen and subscribe! It helps boost the algorithms to get it to others.</li>
<li>Share it with others. Whether it's on facebook, instagram, or even in person, telling people about the first seven episodes that are entirely free will help tremendously in getting support for the show.  You can find graphics for download at <a href=""http://www.omegamanpodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.omegamanpodcast.com</a>
</li>
<li>Leave a review on Apple Podcasts. It helps to show that people like, and positive reviews make me feel good and more inspired to keep going. </li>

$8000 - previous one but just better. I can get more actors to fill in some of the roles that we haven't heard from yet (Warden Jeffries, William and Anikka Gaines, and more) and also gain access to higher quality recording equipment and sound libraries. 
$10,000+ - Everything and more. I will probably start writing season 2. I really doubt I'll get here so if I do, I'll have to think about more of what I can do


The wonder and cost of audio dramas
I personally love audio dramas because of the potential of imagination that they can inspire. Audio has the power to unlock our own vivid dreams to fill in fantastical visuals that would be unachievable on such a small budget. For film, if I wanted a helicopter, then I'd have to rent a helicopter. For audio, I can just cut in the sound of a helicopter and your brain fills in the rest. The budget therefore for audio dramas goes to the time that it takes to make it, and the tools and the actors who can really help bring it to life. 
For the first seven episodes, most of the actors took far below what they are worth because they loved the story or did it as favors to me and my producer, Selah Victor. But as a Christian and a man of integrity, I would love to be able to pay them suitably for their time and talent. I also have a family to feed. The first seven episodes took about 3 months of writing, recording, and editing and I would love to be able to dedicate my time to helping bring season 1 to full fruition. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute financially there are some powerful ways you can help.

Listen and subscribe! It helps boost the algorithms to get it to others.
Share it with others. Whether it's on facebook, instagram, or even in person, telling people about the first seven episodes that are entirely free will help tremendously in getting support for the show.  You can find graphics for download at www.omegamanpodcast.com

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I'm Ian Knowles, creator of Neon Shadows A Noir Tale and voice actor of Frank Dixon.  This campaign exists to help fund our second and and most ambitious season yet of Neon Shadows A Noir Tale.  Neon Shadows is a noir drama podcast series. We absolutely love noir and feel it is an underserved genre especially in new media. If you haven't heard season one yet you can listen here  <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thank-you-from-neon-shadows/id1526278698?i=1000491286139%C2%A0We"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/thank-you...</a> consider the first season a success and a solid proof of concept. Help us keep it alive and well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are asking for at least $500 for equipment upgrades such as microphones and sound proofing , advertising, and being able to pay voice actors who are currently working for fun and passion alone. If we are only partially funded the money will prioritize equipment upgrades and providing voice actors with a ""work from home"" setup where they can record remotely. Especially given the covid -19 circumstances this will be the highest priority. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Covid-19 and pandemic regulations put a damper on creative projects, planning, and gathering together to work on the project.  Production is a slower process when we adhere to these new standards of procedure. However,  the digital age affords us alternatives and with the right equipment and management the effect should be minimal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand in these tough times money may be scarce. But let's say you love the idea or you love season one but, how do you help? We've gotten thousands of downloads by word of mouth and organic discovery and thats where you come in! Share this fundraiser campaign with those who may be interested.  Follow us on all our social media such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Heck, we are even on LinkedIn! Share our posts and tell people to check out Neon Shadows on Patreon as well!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Harleigh Nelson, and I am looking to fund a creative and educational podcast series that shines a light on women that have made contributions to our societies! I first started my collegiate career as a History major, and chose to follow my passion for Media Production and Performance Art. During my time as a History major, I discovered incredible women that have made astounding contributions that I firmly believe would have enriched our everyday lives if we had known about them. I discovered that we women, weren't just sitting there twiddling our thumbs. We work working, educating, and creating. I have been fortunate enough to find a way for my two passions to come together, and I want to share that with people. I don't want my nieces and future daughters to have to get to the collegiate level to be inspired by other women.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This funding is to help with the initial cost of the podcast. </p>
<ul>
<li>$550  for Portraits of 3 ladies</li>
<li>$400 for Creators hours</li>
<li>$200 for writing and transcribing software </li>
<li>$100 for editing software</li>
<li>$65 for Microphone</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy stickers, posters, mugs, and your pick of a lady!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will allow me to gather research over more women, create poetic art pieces over a woman's life, record the piece, and bring on a guest for a 20-30 minute discussion over the woman. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have faced a few obstacles while producing this podcast. The biggest, being time and money. I have been working full time while going to school to finish my Bachelors degree. With this crowd funding, I will be able to take the time off of the day job that has been supporting me throughout college, and dedicate it to this podcast. </p>

<h3>How It Started...</h3>
<p>As the global pandemic disrupted countless aspects of life for many people, fandom communities anticipating in-person events had to find new ways to come together.</p>
<p>In an effort to support the new era of virtual events, former media company <strong>Multifacetedacg Productions, LLC</strong> created a 1-day online event to celebrate the diverse podcast community within the Korean Wave. The festival and its 6 sponsors brought together over 60 fans and media guests, 12 podcasts and online radio shows, and contributed a donation to the <strong><a href=""http://www.nami.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)</a></strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where It's Heading...</h3>
<p>The event will return as a 2-day online experience with increased focus on raising awareness and funds for NAMI. While the festival will bring together people from many areas of the fanbase, the festival hopes to continue advocating for minority mental health month.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/kpopsocialnight"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kpop Social Night (KPSN)</strong></a> is a family-friendly fandom event that promotes fun and fandom pride and, now as a stand-alone entity, aims to annually host KPSN Podcast Fest as its leading affair.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help many in the Hallyu fanbase access fact-based information about mental health</li>
<li>Advocacy for quality mental healthcare and safe resources easier for minorities in the U.S.</li>
<li>Creating an annual fundraiser an accessible fan-driven experience for Hallyu fans at an affordable price</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Though the event is several weeks away, we cannot meet our goals without your support. Through this crowdfunding, we are making steps towards achieving these goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Securing at least 20 podcasts/online radio shows as special guests </li>
<li>At least 100 General Admission pre-sale tickets sold at the 2020 price of $5.00 USD</li>
<li>At least $150.00 USD towards the fundraising goal of $500.00 USD</li>

<h3>Who we are and what we're about</h3>
<p>Just so you know, we are a father daughter team, we aren't crazy (well, just a little) and we actually like each other and most of all, we're residential designers.  We meet homeowners every day that have questions.  Questions that come tumbling out at mach speed in the grocery line once they find out what we do for a living.  Invariably, they want to do something to their house but they have no clue where to start.  They are often lost or have been told conflicting information and quickly approaching panic stage.  So in an effort to cut down our time in the grocery store and speed the lines along, we have chosen to embark on the noble journey of a podcast.  The problem is, with every google search you are drowning in people trying to sell you ""a solution"".  When you talk to a hammer salesman, every problem looks like a nail.  Good news!  We don't want to sell you a damn thing and we've been doing this for forty years.  We are doing this podcast business without sponsors so that we can keep the content unadulterated from retailer's grubby hands.  In case you don't know, this isn't exactly easy 'cauz makin' us look this pretty ain't cheap.  So we need you!  Actually, help us help you.  Take a gander at our video and pledge a few bucks.  Hell, pledge a lotta bucks!  If you need a little more convincing, zip over to our nearly finished website and learn how delightful we can be.  We are nerds and deeply love everything about homes from design through construction and truly want to help every one of you we can.  Can you smell our despiration?</p>
<h3>What we need and where we're headed</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Like I said, we’re residential designers. Although a career we enjoy very much, the odds we are going to retire rich are slim to zilch. Launching  a podcast isn’t something you throw into the budget very easily. Despite that, we have invested about $50k in modifications to our design studio to begin the process of showing you the real world of home design and renovation construction. No scripts allowed. We want you to see how it really happens. To our chagrin, we pretty well tapped out our nest egg.  Aaron is pondering standing on a street corner with a metal cup to clink around for pocket change. Help save her from this humiliation. You’d think as her father I wouldn’t let her do that, but I’m not a proud man. Seriously, to complete everything necessary to bring this production to full video production and routine weekly operation, we’ll need $100,000 in a perfect world. To launch the podcast in an audio only format and neutralize our debt, we need $60,000. Did we mention, you don’t get rich in design?</p>
<p>At this point, we have installed boom mics, fixed cameras, an audio mixing station, a state-of-the art editing system and office space for the poor soul that will work tirelessly to make us look pretty every week. However, we aren’t done yet. We still need body mics, software, field cameras, and a slew of other equipment. Moreover, we need operating cash to launch and sustain the podcast and related personnel for at least six months as our fan base expands. We do have sponsors standing in the wings that don’t violate our ethic of avoiding retail influence. In fairness, these are all companies you’re going to want to know. Unfortunately, they want to see us catch air before they dive into the deep end with us.  So this is where you come in. We need your couch cushion change (or tax refund) to get this fun produced.</p>
<h3>What does this mean to you?</h3>
<p>When you read my bio, you’ll see I have been doing this for forty years. 27 of those years I was concurrently a builder. For four decades I have watched this industry change in so many ways, I cannot begin to list them here. The over arching result of these changes, is that this industry have become complicated, confusing, frustrating and often just daunting for the venturesome homeowner. The most enjoyable part of the process is the day you come up with the idea you want to do something profound to your home. Just about everything after that leads to what we call ‘Maalox moments’. Our mission is to ratchet down the need for antacids, empowering you with knowledge. My industry has devolved into a retail based poop tornado. A poop-nado of misinformation. We are asking you to invest in what we are confident will be the best resource for an honest perspective and realistic management of expectations. Please partner with us to right the course of this wayward ship we call residential home building. The long term format of this podcast is a subscription base. It’s the only way we could practically foresee maintaining a quality broadcast without the influence of retail sponsors.  Just so you know, this isn’t the last time we’ll ask you for money. So what’s the downside? If we don’t fund, we will still produce this program, as our passion runs too deep (and we’re in too deep) to abandon ship. However, without your generosity, we will have to limit the frequency of our broadcast and forgo video for an indefinite period. Let’s be honest, this will be far more exciting if you can see our mugs and watch Aaron do a faceplant from time to time (she’s not the queen of grace). So now you have an idea of who we are and what we need. Besides a fabulous program and a wealth of knowledge that you can delight fellow homeowners with, check out the perks to see what you get (other than bragging rights).</p>

<h3>Assumptions of the project</h3>
<p>The realization of a project and in particular of a <strong>videogame on an independent level</strong> poses technical and motivational difficulties that can <strong>overwhelm </strong>anyone.</p>
<p>Always in the balance between dream and regret, the journey towards the creation of a video game in my opinion needs sharing and motivation even more than the necessary skills.</p>
<p>The <strong>indieGo.xyz</strong> project (<strong>indie </strong>for independent game development, <strong>Go</strong> stay for start your project, don't give up and keep dreaming and <strong>xyz </strong>recalls to the three Cartesian axes foundation of the development of a video game) is born from the passion of a single person and wants to be a natural meeting point and a technical and motivational sharing point for anyone who embraces the dream of creating their own game, whether for passion or for work.</p>
<p>The project has already been born and can be found at this link: <strong><a href=""https://www.indiego.xyz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiego.xyz</a></strong></p>
<p>Already then why apply for funds you are wondering?</p>
<p>Because <strong>a good idea</strong> and a good realization <strong>are not enough</strong>. It is necessary to make yourself known and get to every possible developer out there and in order to do it in the end you come up against the need to go through the expensive channels available on the web like socials, YouTube and more.</p>
<p>Since its birth, hundreds of developers have joined together on <strong>indieGo.xyz</strong>, but to make the necessary quality leap, while keeping the project open and free, the personal budget of a single person is not enough.</p>
<p>Without considering the thousands and more ideas related to design, t-shirts, partnerships, mobile apps, events, hosting improvements and more.</p>
<p>Ideas that also come from the same community that is small but passionate.</p>
<p>The project can become a real job with callaborators but now this can be only a dream.</p>
<p>My personal dream has found a concrete form that is also a guarantee for you that you read that there is more than words here but it is also clear that for great results the passion and a necessarily limited personal budget are no longer enough.</p>
<p>Clearly the first way to support the project is to sign up now @ <strong><a href=""https://www.indiego.xyz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiego.xyz</a></strong> and take an active part in the discussions but if you believe (and of course you want) that this project may have a great future as it is in my head and as I wrote above or even want to offer a coffee (I drink too many in reality) or maybe a pizza (I'm Italian on the other hand) to this poor dreamer I could only be grateful, first of all because you'll let me know that this my idea (which could have died many times) also has value for many others.</p>

In 2020, the global eSports market was valued at just over 950 million U.S. dollars. According to the source's estimates, global eSports market revenue will reach almost 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2023. The eSports industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The majority of these revenues come from sponsorships and advertising, and the rest from media rights, publisher fees, merchandise and tickets, digital, and streaming. In terms of revenues, Asia and North America represent the two largest eSports markets, with China alone accounting for almost one fifth of the market.</p><p>""Statista 2020""</p><p>Worldwide eSports viewer numbers 2018-2023, by type</p><p>Published by Christina Gough, Apr 28, 2020</p><p> The eSports market has boomed in recent years with more and more viewers tuning in to watch their favorite games being played by some of the best gamers in the world. By 2023, there are expected to be almost 300 million frequent viewers of eSports worldwide, a vast increase from the 173 million in 2018. Additionally, some 351 million people are forecast to be occasional viewers of eSports by 2023.</p><p>""Statista 2020""<br/><br/><strong>eSports in the U.S.</strong><br/><br/>There were an estimated 25.7 million eSports viewers in the United States in 2018, a figure which is projected to rise to over 46 million by 2023. This means that, by 2023, an estimated 15.5 percent of internet users will be watching eSports at least once per month. This is a considerable number for an industry that was once considered to be a niche section of the gaming market. While the potential for the eSports industry in the United States is huge, it is nothing compared the market size in Asia Pacific. According to the estimates, over half of the world's frequent eSports viewers and enthusiasts can be found in Asia Pacific, compared to just 12 percent in North America.</p><p>""Statista 2020""<br/><br/><strong>Leading eSports tournaments</strong><br/><br/>The most watched eSports event as of January 2018 was the 2018 Mid-Season Invitational League of Legends tournament. This tournament was hosted by Germany and France and recorded 60 million unique viewers. With millions of viewers tuning in to watch expert gamers battle it out, it is unsurprising that large sums of money are at stake. The International 2019, which was the ninth edition of the annual DOTA 2 world championship, had a combined prize pool of over 34 million U.S. dollars.

However, much like broadcast television, consumers need to sit through advertisements. You can see AVOD in action when watching DailyMotion, YouTube and 4OD, where ad revenue is used to offset production and hosting costs. </p><p>Premium content owners rarely use AVOD as it generates lower amounts of revenue than SVOD and TVOD. It’s interesting to note that YouTube has started to move its subscription-based Premium content to an ad-based model, with reports that the service was slow to catch on with users.</p><p>""Market Study Report 2020""</p><p><strong>Live Streaming :</strong></p><p><strong>Market Snapshot</strong></p><p>Live videos or live streaming activity increased significantly by the mid of 2015. Brands and public figures became active in interacting with their intended audience via online platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Furthermore, as the popularity of esports and video games increased among millennials and generation Z, live video game streaming gained momentum, thereby boosting the global live streaming market. As per a survey conducted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) in 2018, more than two-thirds (67%) of consumers, globally, have streamed live video content, and 52% of that group prefer free, ad-supported live streaming, over subscription-based and à la carte services. Additionally, 47% of consumers, globally, have reported an increase in their live streaming activity since last year. Furthermore, social platforms are the key source of live video content, and TV is the most popular type of live video content accessed.</p><p>""Market Research Future 2020""</p><p>Amidst the nationwide full/partial lockdowns across the globe due to the spread of COVID-19, live streaming activity has grown by almost 50% as compared to the pre-COVID period. In April 2020 alone, several live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube witnessed a significant increase in the viewership. Analyzing the trend and the nature/characteristics of COVID-19, even during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are maintaining social distancing and avoiding huge gatherings, live streaming is increasingly becoming the preferred option for organizing concerts and other big events. This scenario is expected to increase the compound annual growth rate of the market to 28.1% during the forecast period of 2020 to 2027.</p><p>""Market Study Report 2020""</p><p>The global live streaming market is dominated by a few big players who have been offering add-on services and features to their live streaming platforms. Amazon, Twitch, Vimeo, IBM Corporation, Facebook, and Google are key companies offering live streaming platforms. These companies have witnessed a significant increase in their year on year revenue and viewership. Apart from big players (mentioned above), the small and regional players, including Huya.com, Periscope, Flux Broadcast, and EventStreaming.tv, have also achieved a strong footing in their home markets.

In 2020, the global eSports market was valued at just over 950 million U.S. dollars. According to the source's estimates, global eSports market revenue will reach almost 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2023. The eSports industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The majority of these revenues come from sponsorships and advertising, and the rest from media rights, publisher fees, merchandise and tickets, digital, and streaming. In terms of revenues, Asia and North America represent the two largest eSports markets, with China alone accounting for almost one fifth of the market.""Statista 2020""Worldwide eSports viewer numbers 2018-2023, by typePublished by Christina Gough, Apr 28, 2020 The eSports market has boomed in recent years with more and more viewers tuning in to watch their favorite games being played by some of the best gamers in the world. By 2023, there are expected to be almost 300 million frequent viewers of eSports worldwide, a vast increase from the 173 million in 2018. Additionally, some 351 million people are forecast to be occasional viewers of eSports by 2023.""Statista 2020""eSports in the U.S.There were an estimated 25.7 million eSports viewers in the United States in 2018, a figure which is projected to rise to over 46 million by 2023. This means that, by 2023, an estimated 15.5 percent of internet users will be watching eSports at least once per month. This is a considerable number for an industry that was once considered to be a niche section of the gaming market. While the potential for the eSports industry in the United States is huge, it is nothing compared the market size in Asia Pacific.

This tournament was hosted by Germany and France and recorded 60 million unique viewers. With millions of viewers tuning in to watch expert gamers battle it out, it is unsurprising that large sums of money are at stake. The International 2019, which was the ninth edition of the annual DOTA 2 world championship, had a combined prize pool of over 34 million U.S. dollars. In addition, the cumulative prize pool for DOTA 2 tournaments around the world in 2019 stood at a huge 47 million U.S. dollars.""Statista 2020""SVOD – subscription video on demandSVOD is similar to traditional TV packages, allowing users to consume as much content as they desire at a flat rate per month. Major services include Sky (plus its subsidiary Now TV), Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu, with new services coming from the likes of Apple, HBO and Disney.With SVOD, there is far greater freedom to opt out, as consumers aren’t tied into a long-term contract. This offers greater flexibility to users, and providers of SVOD are continually challenged with retaining consumers, by providing exclusive new content, aggressive pricing schemes – and probably both. ""Market Study Report""Video Streaming (SVoD)Revenue in the Video Streaming (SVoD) segment is projected to reach US$51,617m in 2020.Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2020-2025) of 10.7%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$85,735m by 2025.User penetration will be 11.9% in 2020 and is expected to hit 17.2% by 2025.The average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to amount to US$58.52.In global comparison, most revenue will be generated in the United States (US$24,079m in 2020).In the Video Streaming (SVoD) segment, the number of users is expected to amount to 1,337.1m by 2025. ""Market Study Report 2020""TVOD – transactional video on demandTVOD is the opposite of subscription video, where consumers purchase content on a pay-per-view basis. There are two sub-categories, known as electronic sell-through (EST), where you pay once to gain permanent access to a piece of content; and download to rent (DTR), where customers access a piece of content for a limited time for a smaller fee. TVOD services tend to offer more recent releases, providing rights holders with higher revenues and giving consumers timely access to new content. TVOD services typically retain customers by offering attractive price incentives, so they continue to return in the future.Examples of TVOD services include: Apple’s iTunes, Sky Box Office and Amazon’s video store. Imagen can provide both subscription and pay-per-view models for your hosted video. ""Market Study Report 2020""Pay-per-View (TVoD)Revenue in the Pay-per-View (TVoD) segment is projected to reach US$4,682m in 2020.Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2020-2025) of 1.9%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$5,138m by 2025.User penetration will be 6.4% in 2020 and is expected to hit 7.3% by 2025.The average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to amount to US$9.75.In global comparison, most revenue will be generated in the United States (US$1,688m in 2020). ""Market Study Report 2020""A new player to the game – is Premium Video on Demand (PVOD) here to stay?With films typically collecting up to 90% of their lifetime gross during the first four weeks of release, studios have long been pushing to shorten the exclusive theatrical window.

However, much like broadcast television, consumers need to sit through advertisements. You can see AVOD in action when watching DailyMotion, YouTube and 4OD, where ad revenue is used to offset production and hosting costs. Premium content owners rarely use AVOD as it generates lower amounts of revenue than SVOD and TVOD. It’s interesting to note that YouTube has started to move its subscription-based Premium content to an ad-based model, with reports that the service was slow to catch on with users.""Market Study Report 2020""Live Streaming :Market SnapshotLive videos or live streaming activity increased significantly by the mid of 2015. Brands and public figures became active in interacting with their intended audience via online platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Furthermore, as the popularity of esports and video games increased among millennials and generation Z, live video game streaming gained momentum, thereby boosting the global live streaming market. As per a survey conducted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) in 2018, more than two-thirds (67%) of consumers, globally, have streamed live video content, and 52% of that group prefer free, ad-supported live streaming, over subscription-based and à la carte services.

In April 2020 alone, several live streaming platforms such as Twitch and YouTube witnessed a significant increase in the viewership. Analyzing the trend and the nature/characteristics of COVID-19, even during the COVID-19 crisis, when people are maintaining social distancing and avoiding huge gatherings, live streaming is increasingly becoming the preferred option for organizing concerts and other big events. This scenario is expected to increase the compound annual growth rate of the market to 28.1% during the forecast period of 2020 to 2027.""Market Study Report 2020""The global live streaming market is dominated by a few big players who have been offering add-on services and features to their live streaming platforms. Amazon, Twitch, Vimeo, IBM Corporation, Facebook, and Google are key companies offering live streaming platforms. These companies have witnessed a significant increase in their year on year revenue and viewership. Apart from big players (mentioned above), the small and regional players, including Huya.com, Periscope, Flux Broadcast, and EventStreaming.tv, have also achieved a strong footing in their home markets.

<p>Para eso inventamos el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong>.</p>
<p>Y queremos pasar por la hermosa ciudad de <strong>Medellín</strong>, en <strong>Colombia</strong>.</p>
<h3>Qué es el <i>No sé, dime tour MEDELLÍN</i>
</h3>
<p>Agarrar nuestras maletas para ir a <strong>Medellín</strong>, encontrar un teatro para grabar en vivo nuestro podcast contigo muerto de risa en el público, invitar a un ""salmón"" famoso de <strong>Colombia</strong> para que se siente con nosotros (si no has escuchado el podcast, no sabes qué es un ""salmón""... ¡cambia eso de ti!) y nos deje entrevistarlo para que nos cuente por qué también siente que no pertenece, documentar todo nuestro viaje con un equipo de profesionales audiovisuales de cada ciudad y convertir nuestro pequeño podcast casero en un programa de TV de verdad en el que los protagonistas son los <i>#superdiamantes</i> que nos escuchan en todo el mundo.</p>
<h3><b>Cómo queremos hacerlo</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hacer un programa como este es súper ambicioso. No solo tienes que invertir en la producción del evento, en los pasajes, en el alojamiento, sino también en trabajar con un equipo de profesionales con la experiencia suficiente para garantizar que el resultado final no tenga nada que envidiarle a programas que puedes ver en lugares como <strong>Netflix</strong> o <strong>HBO</strong>.</p>
<p>A lo mejor no lo sabes, pero un sólo episodio de un programa así puede llegar a costar cientos de miles de dólares en el mundo real.</p>
<h3>Por qué nosotros</h3>
<p>Si nos conoces sabes que desde hace años hemos desarrollado proyectos para <strong>Youtube</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong>, <strong>Snap Inc</strong>, <strong>Batanga Media</strong>, <strong>AOL</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>HLN</strong>, <strong>Univision</strong>,<strong> Discovery</strong>, <strong>NBC Universo</strong>, <strong>Mitú</strong>, <strong>Fullscreen</strong>, <strong>Clevver TV</strong>, <strong>Broadway Video</strong> y marcas como <strong>McDonalds</strong>, <strong>Bud Light</strong>, <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Volvo</strong>, <strong>Ford</strong>, <strong>Covergirl</strong>, <strong>Makeup Forever</strong>, <strong>Best Buy</strong>, <strong>Target</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Johnny Walker</strong>, entre muchas otras.</p>

<p>Pero nada de eso importa tanto como que tú lo veas y escuches cada semana.</p>
<p>Por eso esto queremos llevarlo a otro nivel y hacerlo teniendo control del proyecto y dejando que seas tú mismo quién está detrás de esto.</p>
<p>Queremos algo de superdiamantes para superdiamantes.</p>
<p>Y aunque nosotros somos buenos consiguiendo ayuda y haciendo que cosas de ultra bajo presupuesto se vean bien, aún así necesitamos un monto mínimo para poder llevar el <strong>No sé, dime tour</strong> a cada país.</p>
<p><strong>No hacemos esto para hacernos millonarios</strong>, pero sí creemos que con tu ayuda podríamos hacer algo que nos gusta a nosotros y a ti por muchísimos años más.</p>
<h3>El problema</h3>
<p>Montar esta producción tiene costos operativos importantes.</p>
<p>Desde conseguir el teatro hasta conseguir alojamiento, los pasajes, grabar, editar todo para que esté al nivel de un programa de televisión...</p>
<p>Así que si vamos a hacerlo, vamos a hacerlo bien y repetir esto en todos los países que podamos.</p>
<p>Pero si nuestros superdiamantes de <b>Medellín</b> nos han dicho la verdad, no sólo podemos hacer esto sino cualquier cosa.</p>
<p>Tenemos en ustedes todo lo que hace falta para lograrlo. </p>
<p>Y lo mejor es que podremos seguir escribiendo el libro que lees semana a semana en <a href=""https://www.wedontbelong.com/es/category/we-dont-belong-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wedontbelong,com</a> y podemos seguir grabando series como <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFkSF132-1Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One Girl Show</a> y seguir luchando por nuestros sueños locos en Hollywood.</p>
<h3><strong>Lo que nos hace falta</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Al menos 400 superdiamantes en cada ciudad  que compren una entrada a un precio súper asequible.</li>
<li>Recaudar con la venta de esas entradas al menos $20,000 para ir a <strong>Medellín</strong>.</li>
<li>Utilizar parte de ese dinero para producir un evento genial y convertirlo en un episodio de nuestro programa.</li>
<li>Usar el resto para seguir haciendo el podcast y todo nuestro contenido cada semana.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cómo lo utilizaremos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alquiler del Teatro (entre 30% y 50% de lo recaudado)</li>
<li>Merch</li>
<li>Logística (Alojamiento, pasajes, transporte, comidas)</li>
<li>Alquiler de equipos</li>
<li>Honorarios de producción</li>
<li>Mercadeo de la gira</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lo que ofrecemos</strong></h3>
<p>Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Medellín en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos <i>perks </i>para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).</p>
<h3>Por qué te necesitamos</h3>
<p>Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  </p>
<p>Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.</p>
<h3><strong>El reto</strong></h3>
<p>Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente <strong>después del 15 de Septiembre</strong>, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso <strong>debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días</strong>. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.</p>
<p>La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.</p>
<p>Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.</p>
<p>Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.</p>
<p>Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.</p>
<p>Tal vez no vives en <strong>Medellín</strong>, pero conoces a alguien que vive en <strong>Medellín</strong> y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.</p>
<p>Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.</p>
<p>Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.</p>
<p>¿Contamos contigo?</p>

Además de entradas para que nos acompañes a dejar el corazón en un teatro de la hermosa ciudad de Medellín en un show que tú mismo crearás con nosotros, tenemos perks para superdiamantes que quieran y puedan contribuir con un poquito más para obtener desde cosas súper especiales como franelas que sólo van a estás disponibles si hacemos el tour, estar en los créditos de la serie como productores, o hasta ser invitados especiales en un podcast con nosotros (¡la pizza corre por nuestra cuenta!).
Por qué te necesitamos
Hemos estado haciendo encuestas. Sé qué nos hemos puesto fastidiosos, pero necesitamos estar 100% seguros de que en las ciudades a las que vamos hay suficientes de ustedes para hacer esto.  
Te necesitamos porque no sólo no tenemos dinero para pagar la gira de nuestro bolsillo, sino porque si no logramos que esta gira pase hay muchísimas cosas que muy probable tendremos que también dejar de hacer.
El reto
Queremos arrancar la gira oficialmente después del 15 de Septiembre, por lo que necesitamos producir todo durante el verano. Por eso debemos recaudar el dinero de cada ciudad en sólo 10 días. De esta forma podemos hacer esta misma campaña en las siguiente ciudad hasta completar todas las que podamos comprometernos a visitar este año.
La idea es comenzar con una ciudad y si logramos la meta, hacer otra y otra y otra hasta que podamos llegar a la mayor cantidad de ciudades posibles.
Como ves, estamos apostándolo todo a esto.
Esto es lo que queremos: si logramos hacer al menos 5 ciudades podemos seguir haciendo el podcast.
Si no, tendremos que cancelar todo.
Tal vez no vives en Medellín, pero conoces a alguien que vive en Medellín y que crees que puede gustarle nuestro podcast, pues mándale esta campaña para que vaya por tí.
Luego, cuando le toque a tu ciudad ya sabes lo que tienes que hacer.
Y así hasta que los superdiamantes conquistemos el mundo.
¿Contamos contigo?

<h3>        Each nation in the world holds its own unique musical tradition, polished and refined by thousands and thousands of years. Entire universities are into studying this legacy our forefathers gave us. The science and the technologies develop progressively, but when it comes to the finest strings of our souls, we do not look forward but gaze inside ourselves, a place where the integral part of our essence is, our roots. Now, just as before, they carry their genetic code. Just as the music itself: even before it became classics, jazz or techno, it has always been a very special instrument, a separate language for the human soul. Our page is dedicated to the merging and intertwining of the traditional cultures of the world and the modern electronic and dance scene. We are interested in drawing wide attention to the modern ethnical music and making it popular. We are constantly at search of new names, musicians and corresponding events. If you have something to say that relates to the issue, please kindly contact us to place the information about your event.</h3>

<h3>      2 years ago, with my colleagues, I created a page in which we want to sanctify all the news related to ethnic music and art. It is called the Kiev Ethno Foundation. After 2 years, only I remained in the page management. No, the desire to integrate all fans of ethnic people has not gone away. But the situation in the country is such that none of the editors want to work for free. Summer is coming, I have plans to hold a party in Kiev and other cities of Ukraine. It also takes a little money. To date, we have a Facebook page with 735 subscribers. And the soundcloud page with 1300 subscribers. There are cool exclusive podcasts from artists like Que Sakamoto (Japan), Jose Manuel (France), Javier Cansinos (Spain), Kosa (India) and more other.</h3>

<h3><strong>Ukraine is rising from its knees, we are becoming part of the European society and want to develop our culture. Help us with this. Since our mission is not commercial - to find sponsors is not realistic, that's why we appeal to you, help us.</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>1. Pay for a year account on the soundcloud<br/>2. Salary to editors of our Facebook page.<br/>3. One-time salary SMM manager for raising the page.<br/>4. Money for a promo party.</strong></h3>

<h3>Who are you again?</h3>
<p>Well I'm (Wookiee)Mark, and I stream on Twitch. I'm on the lesser known, smaller side of Twitch known as Twitch Creative. I make stuff! I yell about politics! It's fun I swear!<br/><br/>I used to work in corporate IT for a pretty good salary, but a few years ago I had a series of really bad grand mal seizures and now I've got a traumatic brain injury. Fun, right? Despite over two years' of job applications, interviews, buying new ties... I've been unable to return to my field.<br/><br/>Lucky for me, my Twitch channel is growing! Just... really slowly. Really really slowly. Too slow to catch up on our housing expense.<br/><br/>Your help growing my channel might be just what I need to turn my channel from a hobby endeavor to a viable business for me, and then my family won't be homeless. Sweet, right?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need, and what you get.</h3>
<p>I'm trying to raise about $1200. It's a pretty modest amount I think, but it's one I can't possibly come up with while unemployed. We're not making rent (really, mortgage payments) right now as it is even though my wife is working full time at a really dangerous job.<br/><br/>ALL of this funding will go to upgrading my computer equipment for my livestream so that I can add gaming content and possibly 3D modeling (for printing) content to my stream. My current setup can barely run OBS and get me on Twitch. It's reliable and good, but trying to run Tetris on there is going to make it melt, seriously. If I raise my goal, I'll be able to get a nice sturdy quad core i7 based tower that will run just about anything I want to throw at it and give my stream not just new content, but longevity. I won't have to worry about upgrading for a good while, so I'll have time to grow.<br/><br/>If I only get part of my goal I'll buy some lesser machine that will do the job, but it may not last as long or go as far, you know? Still, everything helps.</p>
<p>What do you get out of it? The smug satisfaction of helping a poor bastard like me possibly get back on his feet, that's good right?</p>
<p>Also if you donate at least $50 I'll add your name to the SEVERED C3PO HEAD! (You can also get on the head by subscribing to my Twitch channel for 9 months at <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/wookieemark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.twitch.tv/wookieemark</a>). You can choose any name or handle you want if you haven't got a Twitch ID (or even if you do!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What does this mean to you?</h3>
<p>This could literally save my family's home. We're in dire straits right now. We've had ENORMOUS success on GoFundMe for the past 9 months and that's kept us in our house, but that funding is about to run out. We met our goal of raising enough to keep the mortgage paid ""for a year"" (really about 9 months after fees) and even with all of that help, it wasn't enough time for me to find a job again. It's pretty rough out there for a 41 year old disabled dude with a brain injury and a broken back, you guys. <br/><br/>We've got two daughters, one who's in college right now to be a social worker and commuting from home to save money. She needs us to keep this place so that she can reach her goals. We've got an 8 year old who might be 9 by the time you read this, because that's real soon. She's homeschooled, sharp as a tack, the kindest kid you've ever met, and she's been on my stream once or twice. She's great. She grew up here, she's lived here her whole life. I'm fighting like hell to make sure she can stay here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well the risk is that I raise the money, expand my content, and... I flop. Twitch is a big pond. I'm on the Creative side right now partly because I haven't got the equipment for gaming there and partly because I just love making stuff! I'll still make stuff and stream it even if this campaign doesn't succeed! But it's extremely hard, nearly impossible, to reach a sustainable revenue on Twitch Creative. It's on Gaming where people are making a living from it.<br/><br/>It's hard to stand out. I'm good at standing out though. I'm a loudmouth, a pain in the ass, and I entertain people sometimes despite themselves. I think that with expanded content and streaming hours, I can climb the ladder. I just need your help to get on the first rung you guys.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<li>You can come watch my stream on Twitch! I'm WookieeMark, do a search or visit <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/wookieemark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.twitch.tv/wookieemark</a>

<li>You can get the word out. Do you know somebody generous who might want to help? Awesome! Do you know somebody who wants to see me make a wookiee mask out of a mass of loose hair? Awesome!! Tell those people!</li>

<h3>Who Am I</h3>
<p><strong>Sharing with you my truth - I'm ashamed, I'm a wanderer. Searching for myself. </strong></p>
<p>Living with Bipolar, Anxiety Disorder, OCD, and CPTSD.  It was only through my latest diagnosis in 2019 that I am able to have a better understanding of my irrational behavior and thoughts, and unexplainable moods throughout my life despite seeking therapy for the past 12 years. My   I am a mom to 3 beautiful young children, and I want to contribute to the society they will live in that they can grow in and to provide a platform for people to turn too. A place of support for you and me. </p>
<h3>Where I Began</h3>
<p>When I started Searching Her, I lost my confidence as I had a lot of self doubt. Thinking that what I do would not matter or be able to create any impact in someone's life. Finances were also a huge concern having a family to feed. Youtube was challenging because i couldn't gather my thoughts constantly, talking to a camera was also daunting. There was that missing connection i couldn't feel behind a screen.</p>
<h3>How It Started</h3>
<p>When I first knew about Live Streaming, I thought to myself this could be an opportunity. Without thinking much I created an account on that very same day. Watching tutorials night after night, doing the setting up was not an easy feat. I started talking to people on the platform as I was very lonely, and was looking for just some company to chat with. </p>
<p>Little did i expect that I would meet many people who are going through similar situations/experiences like myself. And that was when I said, I'm not giving up anymore. Simply because there were so many people out there who did not have an avenue to turn too. And we are all in our dark deepest corners, going through the motion of life and NOT LIVING. Having to catch up with society and what and how media portrays in normalized. <strong>We lost touch with our inner soul. </strong></p>
<p>Least to my surprise,I made to Affiliation Programme of a streaming platform called Twitch <a href=""http://twitch.tv/searchingher"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitch.tv</a> after 6 days which was a huge accomplishment for me, something i dare not even dream about since everyone else was mostly about gaming and Vlogging.</p>
<p>Many people actually started coming forward to express the struggles they were going through when I was live. Many who felt rejected, depressed, and isolated from the society norms. And that was another reason I kept on fighting my personal struggles and conditions.</p>
<p><i><strong>To my surprise, the act of giving, the act of kindness, the act of listening with a heart, could possibly change not just 1 but many peoples life, because they found a sense of belonging and they found the support they have been searching for. Not only have they received grace but they came back even when they were in better conditions to share the  grace, love, kindness and support they received to the others who are now in need now.</strong></i></p>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>I am not a certified therapist nor a psychologist. But what makes it so special is that people have found a thriving community with so much love and warmth. That people did not need to hide how they truly feel and conceal who they really are behind the screen whilst still having genuine frienships as they go along the way. That itself is indescribable. The simple tools of life of a human being which doesn't cost you anything was all that someone needs to get the hope and strength to grow through their daily life battles one step at a time. </p>
<p>This is not to replace professional help especially for people who have Mental Disorders. But rather to be a bridge for people who are in distress or new to Mental Health. To allow and encourage people to step forward with courage in their own space and comfort. In order for them to seek professional help. And along the way continue their jouney together in the world of humanity. </p>
<p>Scoiety these days has spoken too little about our mental health when our mental health should be a top priority. <strong>Think of it this way, a human being needs a heart and a brain to function. Without either, there will be nothing left of us but a souless body</strong>. </p>
<p>I sincerely hope to make an impact by empowering others with their story and a meaningful purpose for their lives amidst the struggles they are going through.  <strong>Please hear me out further.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyone deserves to be heard and have a chance at life no matter the lemons that it gives you.</strong> </p>
<p>With good support and opportunities given to people <strong>the power of healing oneself by helping others is rewarding. </strong></p>
<p>On a side note, I share my family reality life in real-time when the kids are at home with my viewers, as unconventional it may seem. For a start whatever I have started is unconventional of its own. <strong><i>I don't have an explanation for this entire family reality which i do except, A genuine heart. </i></strong>It was a tough decison as exposing my family was a risk that we decided to take. - When my viewers tell me, look, that is warmth i've never got to experience in my life. It makes my heart so full to know that such a risk/decision I made could also be shared with someone else across the world.</p>
<p> I go through my mental conditions every day, my spouse also suffers from PTSD, Depression, Alcohol Addiction, Anxiety Disorder and Agoraophia due to childhood and being in the military for over 10 years. (Left Military Now) . </p>
<p>Secondly, whether you have a mental health illness or disorder, that doesn't mean you don't and can't deserve to have a family. It is possible to have  a family, It is possible for you to find someone who will love you and accept you for who you are. It is possible for you to have kids, and that you are and will be enough for your children. Whether you choose to have kids naturally or via adoption. <i><strong>The Key is - That should not bar you from thinking that you do not and will never be able to have a family of your own. </strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>Here I will explain to you what the finances/plans are</p>
<p>Hoping to raise SGD$20,000 inclusive of the deduction fees. </p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Equipment such as a camera, webcam, lightings etc through better quality content, talk shows and podcast for viewers help bridge this big gap by normalizing mental health issues and potentially save lives that are suffering in silence.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Advertsing to Support Groups that enables me to carry on with this project. and to be able to reach more people in dire need. ( So many people on support groups that I have seen, have not benefited from it and that the community is toxic and that is extremly disheartening to see and hear of) </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Twitch is just a platform I'm using as it's free. I'm looking into going in Youtube fully so that people may also watch at their own convenience, space and comfort especially for people who have not been able to overcome the stigma of getting judged as well. Everything takes time and we can be that positive aid to help someone take the first step. </p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Website Service + Software for both streaming and Video Editing required for me to continue what i'm doing for both live streams and Youtube.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Reaching Out to Organizations once everything is set in place I'm looking at about 3 to 6 months for me to pitch and propose so that we can extend this platform and idea to create more awareness and also avenue for people. </p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Talk Shows with Professionals, Ground Level Individuals to share their experiences and professional advice as deemed. (Informative level)</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>A FREE mobile app creator -  on a bigger spectrum solely for outreach support in real-time with both volunteers and professionals, podcast, provide live chats with viewers, meditation groups, counselors, psychologist and therapist.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> A book at the end of this journey about my life story and how searching her came about. And about how, anyone in this world have a choice to do something positive no matter how trival it maybe. Because each of us, are a contributing factor to the human race and world. Incorporated with other mental health suffers short stories. </p>
<p>In order for the community to thrive and for me to be able to execute the plans, I need to ask for funding as I am unfit to work due to my condition, and my spouse and i have dedicated our life, and family for this cause even before creating this funding. It is only with the community that is in the current support group that enables me to carry on with this project. And with your help to fund the project will we be able to reach out to more people in dire need. </p>
<p>We are all aware that coming out to speak about Mental Health and to seek help is very scary and exhausting not knowing where to go too, or for many cases, people cannot afford to seek therapy as it is too costly. If everyone contributes a little in their own way, whether it's through finances or by offering volunteer support or even spreading word of the campaign. Many lives could change, this itself can give many people the hope and courgae in the midst of darkness whether it's Mental Health-Related or Not. </p>
<p><strong>Lastly, If this project does not reach its funding goal, the finances would then be used for the smaller scales projects, for eg: equipment, software, reaching out to organisations, marketing.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The completion of the project would be tentative as it is ongoing. And I'm looking at building it up slowly with the community that I already have. As of now the live streams and youtube will be ongoing no matter how the outcome will be when I approach organizations. If you have any questions please send me a message directly and I will be able to better explain. If it does not get fully funded I might create another funding based on where the project is at the end of this current fund raise. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Anonymous Diaries</strong> (NEW) - An online gallery for everyone who wishes to express their struggles in their own form (e.g.; drawings, paintings, quotes, articles).  The platform desires to provide individuals a sense of self-worth and belonging by knowing that they are accepted, unjudged, and no longer alone. Anonymous Diaries welcomes anyone who is willing to share their struggles, pain, misery, past experiences, relating to mental health.  This project would be materialized on my current <a href=""http://searchingher.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. </p>
<p>Through “Searching Her”, I also intend to reach out to Mental Health organizations to be a bridge for mental health Patients who want and need professional help. </p>
<p><strong>My vision is for “Searching Her” to be a place of support for you and me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To Love the Unloved, To hear the unheard, To give the unwanted a sense of belonging.</strong></p>

When I first knew about Live Streaming, I thought to myself this could be an opportunity. Without thinking much I created an account on that very same day. Watching tutorials night after night, doing the setting up was not an easy feat. I started talking to people on the platform as I was very lonely, and was looking for just some company to chat with. 
Little did i expect that I would meet many people who are going through similar situations/experiences like myself. And that was when I said, I'm not giving up anymore. Simply because there were so many people out there who did not have an avenue to turn too. And we are all in our dark deepest corners, going through the motion of life and NOT LIVING. Having to catch up with society and what and how media portrays in normalized. We lost touch with our inner soul. 
Least to my surprise,I made to Affiliation Programme of a streaming platform called Twitch Twitch.tv after 6 days which was a huge accomplishment for me, something i dare not even dream about since everyone else was mostly about gaming and Vlogging.
Many people actually started coming forward to express the struggles they were going through when I was live. Many who felt rejected, depressed, and isolated from the society norms. And that was another reason I kept on fighting my personal struggles and conditions.
To my surprise, the act of giving, the act of kindness, the act of listening with a heart, could possibly change not just 1 but many peoples life, because they found a sense of belonging and they found the support they have been searching for. Not only have they received grace but they came back even when they were in better conditions to share the  grace, love, kindness and support they received to the others who are now in need now.
Your Impact
I am not a certified therapist nor a psychologist. But what makes it so special is that people have found a thriving community with so much love and warmth. That people did not need to hide how they truly feel and conceal who they really are behind the screen whilst still having genuine frienships as they go along the way. That itself is indescribable. The simple tools of life of a human being which doesn't cost you anything was all that someone needs to get the hope and strength to grow through their daily life battles one step at a time. 
This is not to replace professional help especially for people who have Mental Disorders. But rather to be a bridge for people who are in distress or new to Mental Health. To allow and encourage people to step forward with courage in their own space and comfort. In order for them to seek professional help. And along the way continue their jouney together in the world of humanity. 
Scoiety these days has spoken too little about our mental health when our mental health should be a top priority. Think of it this way, a human being needs a heart and a brain to function. Without either, there will be nothing left of us but a souless body. 
I sincerely hope to make an impact by empowering others with their story and a meaningful purpose for their lives amidst the struggles they are going through.  Please hear me out further.
Everyone deserves to be heard and have a chance at life no matter the lemons that it gives you. 
With good support and opportunities given to people the power of healing oneself by helping others is rewarding. 
On a side note, I share my family reality life in real-time when the kids are at home with my viewers, as unconventional it may seem. For a start whatever I have started is unconventional of its own. I don't have an explanation for this entire family reality which i do except, A genuine heart. It was a tough decison as exposing my family was a risk that we decided to take. - When my viewers tell me, look, that is warmth i've never got to experience in my life. It makes my heart so full to know that such a risk/decision I made could also be shared with someone else across the world.
 I go through my mental conditions every day, my spouse also suffers from PTSD, Depression, Alcohol Addiction, Anxiety Disorder and Agoraophia due to childhood and being in the military for over 10 years. (Left Military Now) . 
Secondly, whether you have a mental health illness or disorder, that doesn't mean you don't and can't deserve to have a family. It is possible to have  a family, It is possible for you to find someone who will love you and accept you for who you are. It is possible for you to have kids, and that you are and will be enough for your children. Whether you choose to have kids naturally or via adoption. The Key is - That should not bar you from thinking that you do not and will never be able to have a family of your own. 

Finances
Here I will explain to you what the finances/plans are
Hoping to raise SGD$20,000 inclusive of the deduction fees. 
1. Equipment such as a camera, webcam, lightings etc through better quality content, talk shows and podcast for viewers help bridge this big gap by normalizing mental health issues and potentially save lives that are suffering in silence.
2. Advertsing to Support Groups that enables me to carry on with this project. and to be able to reach more people in dire need. ( So many people on support groups that I have seen, have not benefited from it and that the community is toxic and that is extremly disheartening to see and hear of) 
3. Twitch is just a platform I'm using as it's free. I'm looking into going in Youtube fully so that people may also watch at their own convenience, space and comfort especially for people who have not been able to overcome the stigma of getting judged as well. Everything takes time and we can be that positive aid to help someone take the first step. 
4. Website Service + Software for both streaming and Video Editing required for me to continue what i'm doing for both live streams and Youtube.
5. Reaching Out to Organizations once everything is set in place I'm looking at about 3 to 6 months for me to pitch and propose so that we can extend this platform and idea to create more awareness and also avenue for people. 
6. Talk Shows with Professionals, Ground Level Individuals to share their experiences and professional advice as deemed. (Informative level)
7. A FREE mobile app creator -  on a bigger spectrum solely for outreach support in real-time with both volunteers and professionals, podcast, provide live chats with viewers, meditation groups, counselors, psychologist and therapist.
8. A book at the end of this journey about my life story and how searching her came about. And about how, anyone in this world have a choice to do something positive no matter how trival it maybe. Because each of us, are a contributing factor to the human race and world. Incorporated with other mental health suffers short stories. 
In order for the community to thrive and for me to be able to execute the plans, I need to ask for funding as I am unfit to work due to my condition, and my spouse and i have dedicated our life, and family for this cause even before creating this funding. It is only with the community that is in the current support group that enables me to carry on with this project. And with your help to fund the project will we be able to reach out to more people in dire need. 
We are all aware that coming out to speak about Mental Health and to seek help is very scary and exhausting not knowing where to go too, or for many cases, people cannot afford to seek therapy as it is too costly. If everyone contributes a little in their own way, whether it's through finances or by offering volunteer support or even spreading word of the campaign. Many lives could change, this itself can give many people the hope and courgae in the midst of darkness whether it's Mental Health-Related or Not. 
Lastly, If this project does not reach its funding goal, the finances would then be used for the smaller scales projects, for eg: equipment, software, reaching out to organisations, marketing.

Risks & Challenges
The completion of the project would be tentative as it is ongoing. And I'm looking at building it up slowly with the community that I already have. As of now the live streams and youtube will be ongoing no matter how the outcome will be when I approach organizations. If you have any questions please send me a message directly and I will be able to better explain. If it does not get fully funded I might create another funding based on where the project is at the end of this current fund raise. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Anonymous Diaries (NEW) - An online gallery for everyone who wishes to express their struggles in their own form (e.g.; drawings, paintings, quotes, articles).  The platform desires to provide individuals a sense of self-worth and belonging by knowing that they are accepted, unjudged, and no longer alone. Anonymous Diaries welcomes anyone who is willing to share their struggles, pain, misery, past experiences, relating to mental health.  This project would be materialized on my current website. 
Through “Searching Her”, I also intend to reach out to Mental Health organizations to be a bridge for mental health Patients who want and need professional help. 
My vision is for “Searching Her” to be a place of support for you and me.

<h3>About Heavy Metal History:</h3>
<p>Heavy Metal History started in December of 2016 by Dustin Koetsch with the help of his Australian mate Matt Jordan as a podcast to audibly chronicle the history of the Heavy metal genre. Over the course of 65 episodes we've had various metal musicians to talk about and chronicle their records as well as our own oral history episodes starting at the genesis of heavy metal with the band Black Sabbath. We eventually covered most of 1980, then jumping forward into 1987 and current have been deconstructing 1998. Over the year our podcast has grown more than we expected and we feel our content is extremely original and fun.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our current situation:</h3>
<p>About a month ago Dustins MacBook where all episodes are recorded, edited and kept on file began acting erratic by shutting down and rebooting randomly as well as overheating. Eventually the computer shut off all together and got stuck in a ""boot loop"" Dustin took the computer to see if it could be repaired, after 3 days the diagnosis came in that the logic board had failed and due to the age of the computer it can not be ordered or repaired. Dustin currently works 2 jobs to pay for bills and other various life essentials and can not afford a comparable replacement. This is where you come in...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p>Dustin and Matt's goal to keep the podcast alive is to get our faithful and even casual listeners, through various perks to help get a new comparable computer to help save and keep heavy metal history alive and going. This podcast has been one of Dustins biggest passions after a rough couple years of personal life issues and he looks forward every week to recording and putting out these episodes. Without the podcast it feels like there is less purpose in life. We hope you all will channel the power of the metal gods such as Lemmy, Dimebag Darrel and the Ozzman himself to save our Podcast! </p>
<p>The only items were looking to find are for:</p>
<p>The lowest price option for a Mac which is $1,299 before tax</p>
<p>And the cost of getting stickers printed. </p>
<p>That's it. Super simple, all money goes directly to the podcast. </p>
<p>Thanks for checking us out. </p>
