<h3>
<a href=""http://fightguyphotography.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FightGuy Photography"">FightGuy Photography</a> kicks off its first crowdsourcing project!</h3>
<p>A small photography company based in Northern Virginia, FightGuy Photography is looking to bring some fresh and dynamic artwork to life.</p>
<p>Inspired primarily by the images and themes of the Zack Snyder film, <em>Sucker Punch</em>, we've launched our own project based on that tone and style. Why limit such a bold and dynamic world to the story of 5 young women?</p>
<p>More than just a traditional ""ladies with weapons in skimpy outfits"" project, <em>Sucker Punched</em> is looking to showcase women at their strongest. There is no need to sacrifice femininity for strength. The women of this work are strong, powerful, beautiful and deadly. By subverting and reworking the stereotypical archetypes of ""sexy girls"" into powerful icons, we create a world where women aren't powerful in spite of their gender, but because of it. The goal is the celebration of empowerment, not debasement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drawing from sources large and small - the Valkyrie mythos, Sarah Connor, Johanna Dark, Aeon Flux, The Hunger Games, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider, Firefly, Appleseed, Resident Evil, and many more - we've crafted a series of characters and set ups that we think showcase a strong, solid and fun concept.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>We currently have five characters created and three shoots completed (from the top: Domino, Princess and Cherry). However, there is NO LIMIT to how far we can take this project! Reaching our goal will help us create ten shoots, with ten different characters. If we push beyond our goal, we'll keep adding on. We can make 20, 30, 50 different set ups. We can have an army of SP characters.</p>

<p>I moved to Philadelphia 8 years ago and began to visit and vacation at the beaches of South Jersey - a new Jersey Shore experience that seemed familiar but different (Ocean Grove and Cape May; Seaside and Wildwood).  Nonetheless, the same magic was there - beach bikes, boardwalks, rides, restaurants, the dunes, surf and lots of smiles.   I opened a small art gallery in Philadelphia that showed my work and the work of some great emerging painters and sculptors.  I studied documentary and street photography in graduate school and took that approach with the lens when photographing the Jersey Shore with black &amp; white film and an old Nikon camera.  </p>
<p>I'm currently finishing up shooting some of the beaches around Central Jersey (Bay Head, Lavallette, Mantoloking, Chadwick)  this summer and also revisiting most of the other beaches on the Jersey Shore to see what else catches my eye.   The general layout of the book is now up on my John Andrulis Photography Facebook page (minus the photographs I still have left to shoot this month).   My Jersey Shore Summer book does not focus on the tragic destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy (some of those images will be shown when I print the Jersey Shore Winter book in the coming years).  In fact, I feel fortunate to have some photographs of places that have now changed from the hurricane or development, such as the Highlands Drawbridge and the Seaside Pier and Jet Star roller coaster.  The summer book is about celebrating the beauty, joy and laughter the shore brings to people who live or vacation there during the summer months.</p>
<p>Future Plans and Details:</p>

</div></div>","My name is John Andrulis and I've been photographing the Jersey Shore during the winter and the summer for the last eight years, since returning to New Jersey after studying photojournalism in graduate school.  I grew up in the Princeton area and spent much of my youth going to the beaches around Manasquan and Mantoloking (Central Jersey), first with family, then with friends.   It was a place of fun, games, friends, family, sun, seafood and the ocean surf.   When you become grow up, you realize what a respite and retreat the Jersey Shore is from the grind of work, city and daily life.  Inspired quite a bit by the work of the photographer Mary Ellen Mark, I sought to capture the people, places and imagery of the Jersey Shore that make it so special during the summer months.  For me, black & white photography has that timeless quality I find so special in documentary and fine art photography.
I moved to Philadelphia 8 years ago and began to visit and vacation at the beaches of South Jersey - a new Jersey Shore experience that seemed familiar but different (Ocean Grove and Cape May; Seaside and Wildwood).  Nonetheless, the same magic was there - beach bikes, boardwalks, rides, restaurants, the dunes, surf and lots of smiles.   I opened a small art gallery in Philadelphia that showed my work and the work of some great emerging painters and sculptors.  I studied documentary and street photography in graduate school and took that approach with the lens when photographing the Jersey Shore with black & white film and an old Nikon camera.  
I'm currently finishing up shooting some of the beaches around Central Jersey (Bay Head, Lavallette, Mantoloking, Chadwick)  this summer and also revisiting most of the other beaches on the Jersey Shore to see what else catches my eye.   The general layout of the book is now up on my John Andrulis Photography Facebook page (minus the photographs I still have left to shoot this month).   My Jersey Shore Summer book does not focus on the tragic destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy (some of those images will be shown when I print the Jersey Shore Winter book in the coming years).  In fact, I feel fortunate to have some photographs of places that have now changed from the hurricane or development, such as the Highlands Drawbridge and the Seaside Pier and Jet Star roller coaster.  The summer book is about celebrating the beauty, joy and laughter the shore brings to people who live or vacation there during the summer months.
Future Plans and Details:
I have other books ready to go on Philadelphia, Manhattan, The Hamptons, Los Angeles and South Beach, Miami.  I will also continue working on a long term project on photographs of New Jersey.  I plan to expand this project into a small press that publishes the next generation of fine art, documentary and street photography.
The Jersey Shore and Philadelphia will be at least 11x12 inches in size, hardcover, 400 pages long and bookstore quality binding and paper with a Sponsorship and ""Thank You"" page in the beginning to list people who contributed financially to launch these books.  See the Perks.  A $50.00 contribution will get you 1 book and your name on the ""Thank You"" page.   The books will retail for $75.00 when completed and delivered in December 2014.  Limited edition / signed prints are available for purchase.

a Black and White Landscape Photographer, living and working in Montana. 
Impressed by the
beauty of the Northwest Rockies (United States and Canada), I’ve started to
capture its beauty with black and White photography. Spending my summers in
Glacier National Park, I’ve become and enthusiastic photographer, a devoted fly
fisherman and adventurer. 


What is the project?
After a few years
of building my portfolio I am ready to put together a book that I can be proud
of.  ""From the Crown to the Coast; Northern Rockies and Pacific Rain
Forest"" will contain more than 50 stunning black and white (in majority) photographs
of landscapes and wildlife. The project will capture the Beauty of the United
States National Parks (Glacier, Olympic) and Canadian Parks (Alberta and
British Columbia)
You can check my
work on my website, www.maxarchila.com
and facebook page; 
When will the project be
released?
The Project is currently
under progress, The Canadian footage and Olympic peninsula will be on the works
in October 2013, and the Photo Books and photographs will be ready by early
December.  


Why you should
participate?
· 
You're a good friend or a loving family member
· 
Because you love Black and White photography
· 
Would be a great Christmas gift
· 
But mostly because you think my work deserves to be published,
and you love my photographs and postcards. 
The cost for printing 100
high quality books is $6,000.
It is not cheap but this
is what it takes to make a great quality book.
The total Budget

This is an ongoing photo project, exclusively for children with Down Syndrome, launched after years of anticipation. It is inspired by my youngest brother, Joel, who was born in 1987 with Down Syndrome and my life was forever changed...for the much, much better. 







Why Now?


Down Syndrome is in the spotlight and getting more attention than ever these days! This is very exciting, but I want people to really SEE how amazing, beautiful and ""not so different"" these children are. As a photographer whose mission it is to focus on capturing the pure essence of babies and children, I wanted to do the same with people who have Down Syndrome and show the world how incredible the spirits of these children are.

What I Am Working Toward.
Throughout my photographic journey, I will be displaying the images on a blog, facebook and twitter. The ultimate goal for this project is to compile the photos with stories and highlight them in a coffee table book.

Learn more about my photography on my main website and blog


What I Need To Make It Happen.
In order for the families who have expressed interest to be involved, I need to travel to 6-8 major/easily accessible cities in the United States. During each visit, I will have several days worth of shooting with these families. Up to this point, the project has been self-funded, but for it to continue, I need some help from you! I want to make this book a reality and raise awareness about Down Syndrome.

Most of the money raised from this campaign will go directly toward travel expenses, which I estimate to be approximately $1200 per city ($500 for average roundtrip airfare, $200 for rental car and $500 for 2-4 days in a hotel). The more money raised, the more families I can work with! 

Other raised money will cover production costs of the book, as well as cost of printing for prints, postcards and calendars sent to supporters ($2000). Once this goal is met, I will have a separate campaign to fundraise for the cost of space rental and printing for the anticipated gallery show.

<h3>Hey, I'm Kara! This is Intimate Portraits:</h3>
<p>Inside is an untold story.  Something under the layers of clothing and skin, in the soul that wants to come to light.  There is an entire world of depth within the emotions of the mind, wherever they currently rest.  Everyone has something to share and whether painful or playful, there is so much beauty.  The identity of subjects is protected with anonymity as <strong>the most important focus point is the expression of their soul within</strong>.</p>
<p>I've been doing photography for 12 years and this project for 2 of those years.  It's been made through LA, SF, Portland and Seattle with locals and travelers.  Its a dream of mine to bring this project to the public through book and exhibition. Before photographing, I had a different way of dropping in with each person (i.e. an activity, eye gazing, questions, etc).  The project within this book/exhibit shows the space between camera and subject as healing.  To be captured in this way can bring out a variety of emotions: sad, erotic, fun or heart warming.  It's an honor to hold space for everyone and show them how beautiful they can be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Support ART! Buy a book or contribute...</h3>
<p>This project requires a lot of love and some money to get it out to the world.  Because of the content, it needs to be published/printed through private companies.  When you support this project, you receive a ton of love from me as well as a great quality coffee table book, prints or a session of my work. </p>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Hey, I'm Kara! This is Intimate Portraits:
Inside is an untold story.  Something under the layers of clothing and skin, in the soul that wants to come to light.  There is an entire world of depth within the emotions of the mind, wherever they currently rest.  Everyone has something to share and whether painful or playful, there is so much beauty.  The identity of subjects is protected with anonymity as the most important focus point is the expression of their soul within.
I've been doing photography for 12 years and this project for 2 of those years.  It's been made through LA, SF, Portland and Seattle with locals and travelers.  Its a dream of mine to bring this project to the public through book and exhibition. Before photographing, I had a different way of dropping in with each person (i.e. an activity, eye gazing, questions, etc).  The project within this book/exhibit shows the space between camera and subject as healing.  To be captured in this way can bring out a variety of emotions: sad, erotic, fun or heart warming.  It's an honor to hold space for everyone and show them how beautiful they can be.

Support ART! Buy a book or contribute...
This project requires a lot of love and some money to get it out to the world.  Because of the content, it needs to be published/printed through private companies.  When you support this project, you receive a ton of love from me as well as a great quality coffee table book, prints or a session of my work.

My name is Danielle Shitrit,  I'm 23 years old, living in Israel and my goal in life is to become a photojournalist with a focus on conflict and war zones. These days I'm photographing concerts, performances and doing small projects while working at Cafe XoHo in Tel Aviv (the nicest place ever) just to make some money to achieve this goal.
In the last couple of years I've been working extra hard to become a photojournalist and started doing independent projects, taking major steps towards this dream - trying to make it a reality.
I've been photographing for Amnesty International, focusing on the issue of asylum seekers in Israel, for a very long time. In the near future we are continuing our work and going into serious in depth projects together.
I've been covering for a while the issue of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, trying to show people in Israel sides they are usually not exposed to, and to open their minds - a small step for more peaceful times. I believe change is in the small things these days. It is in people’s awareness and in discouraging prejudice and stereotypes.
I participated in an amazing course taught by one of my favorite journalists, Itai Anghel, about conflicts around the world. This gave me a big push to chase my goal.
Besides the projects I do in Israel, I try to dedicate my time and money as much as possible to projects abroad to gain additional experience and information in the field of photojournalism.
Last year I traveled around east Asia for four months and started realizing the process of connecting with people through my camera. During this time I worked on many small projects.
In April of this year, I was in Amsterdam and did a piece on squatting, which has become illegal in the last couple of years due to capitalist legislation. 
In July I attended the Foundry photojournalism workshop in Bosnia and realized even more how much this is what I'm supposed to do with my life.I did a project there about ex-addicts and planning to come back and continue a piece about gay community in Bosnia.What do I need from you? How would you contribute to me?
Photojournalism, unfortunately, is the kind of profession where you spend more money than you make. That becomes a major obstacle in your first steps as a photojournalist, AND THIS IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP:On November 6th I would like to attend an amazing workshop that takes place in Spain - a conflict photography workshop.

The information and experience I’ll get there is priceless and it would be a significant mark on my long way to become a professional photojournalist that focuses on war zones.
How much?
The cost of the workshop is 1500 EUR (I set the goal and perks in dollars so it would be more comfortable). I cannot afford this sum of money. If i can get to the 1500 Euro goal I will use all of this money to go to the workshop. If I don’t achieve this amount but get close enough to it, I will still go to the workshop, but I’ll try to use some of my savings.

The Impact
I feel the camera is a way for me to bring important issues to the general knowledge of others.

<h3>Salted Wounds</h3>
<p>... Is a small book or ""zine"" style collection of photographs that I've put together of pictures  I took in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The size of the finished book is 9"" wide by 7"" high. As of right now, the plan is that it will be a soft-cover magazine-style book that will come packaged in a comic-book style sleeve.</p>
<p>I am a local photographer, living on Long Island all my life. My passion is photography, and I've been doing a Picture-A-Day (PAD) Project for over 1500 days now. I love where I live... I am a true New-Yorker at heart, and was affected deeply by the damage I saw around the area after the storm.</p>
<p>I am honored to have the cover photo being featured in a show called ""Rising Waters"" on Governor's Island, in collaboration with the Museum of the City of New York, and the International Center of Photography. The show features photos from Hurricane Sandy and will run through the end of September. You can get more information on the show by <a href=""http://www.icp.org/events/2013/august/24/rising-waters-photographs-hurricane-sandy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clicking here.</a></p>

<h3>Pre-Sale of Book</h3>
<p>My goal is simple... I need to pre-sell a certain number of books so I can afford to have them printed. I want to keep the cost down so that everyone can afford to buy one. Large, hard cover coffee table books are beautiful, but they are often expensive to print and very expensive to buy, so I chose to go this route instead, keeping it more cost effective for both myself and those who wish to purchase my work.</p>
<p><b>If I receive enough pre-orders</b>, it's possible it will be upgraded to a true soft-cover book with flaps and a much heavier cover (more like a real book and less like a magazine)... but I need to sell <b>at least 500 books</b> for that to happen!<br/></p>
<p><b>UPDATE: </b>I've decided to make ""Salted Wounds"" available as an ebook! Starting at $7, all levels of contribution will get a digital version of the book, including everyone who already signed on to get the printed book and other perks!</p>
<p><b>In other words, everyone who contributes $7 or above will get the ebook!</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>First 150 Contributors...</b></h3><p></p>
<p>I just got some great news that will allow me to include a unique surprise for the first 150 or so contributors -- SO GET IN EARLY and you'll get a very special gift from me shipped to you along with your other perks!</p>

<h3>We're all made of star stuff</h3>
<p>Do you love astronomy? Have you ever thought of getting into astrophotography but are just daunted by everything you need to get started?</p>
<p>I love astronomy, physics, science, and astrophotography. I love that I can point my telescope at a patch of sky, tell it to acquire images all night long and wake up every morning looking forward to the data I collected. I'd love to share this with people like YOU!</p>
<p><i>There is nothing better than waking up to a gift of the cosmos after every clear night.</i></p>
<p><u><i>I'd be thrilled to help you love this hobby as much as I do!</i></u></p>
<p>Not only do I want to make astrophotography more available, I want to make it more open. The beauty of the cosmos is up there waiting - waiting for it to be captured, shared, and enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>We often get so busy with our lives we don't stop to look.</p>
<p>We often live in parts of the world where we forget what it means to look! If you live in a city center and you look up at the night sky you may only see the brightest of stars and brightest of planets. It's easy to take our skies for granted when we forget what is up there!</p>
<p>We want to give you the gift of the heavens.</p>
<p>We'll make sure you have high quality data, tools and resources needed to process this data and the rights to use the data as you see fit with minimal restriction!</p>
<ul>
<li>We grant you the freedom to use the data and enjoy the benefits of using it.</li>
<li>We grant you the freedom to study the data and to apply knowledge acquired from it.</li>
<li>We grant you the freedom to make and redistribute copies, in whole or in part, of the information or expression.</li>
<li>We grant the freedom to make changes and improvements, and to distribute derivative works.</li>

<p>Share the works on social media, use it on your blogs, make prints, hang it up on the wall. This is your cosmos!</p>
<p>All data will be licensed under the <u>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</u>. We just ask that you link back to the source (our website where you download the data)</p>
<p><strong>I'm new to this - what exactly does ""Data"" mean?</strong></p>
<p>Digital Astrophotography uses high end cooled cameras to image the cosmos with precision. The images are saved as individual ""Sub exposures"" often a few minutes long. These sub exposures are then ""Stacked"" (consolidated) and processed to reduce noise, improve signal and then these integrated images are then post-processed to pull out the faint objects we're imaging to produce beautiful photos.</p>
<p><strong>** Update:</strong>  Check out one of our latest blog posts to download some sample data and see one of our guides of <a href=""https://rockchucksummit.com/the-heart-nebula-ic-1805-sharpless-2-190/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">processing the Heart Nebula.</a></p>
<p><strong>Why this campaign?</strong></p>
<p>We want to share the cosmos with you.</p>
<p>It's in my DNA to share. I've found the best way to learn something and experience something is to share it and teach it to others.</p>
<p>Waking up to beautiful data I can integrate &amp; process is great - but helping people like you get into the hobby, learn to process data and have access to data acquired by great equipment in great skies is what keeps me going.</p>
<p>I've already invested heavily in some amazing gear - the only thing left is amazing skies! I want to share these skies with you!</p>
<p>If this campaign is successful and there is interest in opening the cosmos, we may seek out not for profit status to make a sustainable long-term project and outreach program to broaden our reach.</p>
<p><strong>No telescope required!</strong></p>
<p>All you need is a computer.  We'll provide how-to guides, data, and resources to help you get started. </p>
<p>If you choose a reward that includes raw data, you will need tools to calibrate, integrate and process this data. We'll send you guides on open source, commercial and free software you can use.</p>
<p><strong>Do you already have a telescope?</strong></p>
<p>If you have a telescope, you can keep using it! In fact, you can use our data to supplement data you get from your own location.</p>
<p>If you live in the southern hemisphere, we'll happily image targets you can't get!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to get our equipment to dark skies and share the privilege of such beautiful skies to all. And I mean ALL.</p>
<p>It's that simple!</p>
<p>When it comes to astrophotography ""Signal to Noise Ratios"" mean everything.  In dark skies, we get more signal. With more signal, we have better data. With better data, we spend more time collecting more targets than we do having to spend time to overcome the noise to capture those targets.</p>
<p><strong>Darks skies is ""Win-Win"".</strong></p>
<p>To show what dark skies mean, check out this approximation of the bortle scale.  Most of us live/work in bortle ratings above 6 here in the US unless you live in a rural area. Even if you live in rural areas, you see the ""light domes"" of the cities that are near you. Light pollution is a real problem, but since we can't solve light pollution, we can open dark skies to more people by taking advantage of observatories in these bortle 1-2 zones.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600558730/q7vi9ddazxotu75ndtu3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>If we make our goal</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $6k to be able to co-locate our fully automated scope in a dark sky, secure and connected observatory for 1/year. The entirety of the $6k will be used to pay for the pier, power, electricity, and internet connectivity in an established &amp; secure observatory with on-site staff to assist, as necessary. </p>
<p><u>All the observing equipment is already owned, setup and fully integrated &amp; automated. </u></p>
<p><u><strong>Stretch goals</strong></u></p>
<p>If we make 10k, everyone will get 2 years of open data from dark skies!</p>
<p>If we make 15k, everyone will get 3 years of open data! from dark skies</p>
<p>Share this campaign with your friends and family - the more we raise the longer we can have access to dark skies, the more targets we can image and the more data we can share!</p>
<p><strong>If we don't make our goal</strong></p>
<p>We're still going to dark skies.  If we don't meet or exceed our campaign goals then we'll have to restrict our shared data to those who contribute since the costs of making it free for all would be more expensive than I can self-fund. </p>
<p>So yes, if you commit to any of our rewards, you will get data.  If we don't meet our total goal, then we'll see about other ways we can work on making it happen.</p>
<p>I'm not giving up that easy ;)</p>
<p>We either surpass our goals and help astrophotographers in general, or we raise enough to help those who contributed.</p>
<p><strong>We want to exceed our goals!</strong></p>
<p>That's right, if you share this campaign and we exceed our base goal and hit stretch-goals then everyone receives the extra rewards!</p>
<p>Stretch Goal 1:  10k Raised - 24 months of open data from our dark sky observatory,</p>
<p>Stretch Goal 2: 15k Raid - 36 months of open data from our dark sky observatory,</p>
<p>Our goal is to keep our telescope collecting data every night we can operate. </p>
<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>Rewards will start upon conclusion of this campaign, however, there will be a short break with imaging to move our equipment and set up at the new observatory. We'll announce that timeline as we figure out the contract and availability of pier/adapters needed from our vendors.</p>
<p><strong>All Perks</strong></p>
<p>All persons who contribute in any Perk level will receive login access to our website, an ad-free experience when logged in, early access to all content, processing guides, how-to guides and special insider access to everything Astrophotography. We'll share videos of how we acquire images, our scopes operating, how things are set up, how we image, how we choose targets. Our goal is to open the cosmos, but also ensure open access to it.  Not just so you can consume it, but so you can learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>Email</strong></p>
<p>Want to just pitch in a few bucks to help us out? Select an email reward and we'll write you a personalized thank you letter with a little surprise within it! We'll also make sure you never see ads on our website, it's the least we can do!</p>
<p><strong>Open Images</strong></p>
<p>Looking to help us with a bit more money but not interested in processing the data? We'll give you full access to our full high-res images on our fast cloud storage. No more chasing around how to right-click download target or any of that. You get access to the library of all processed images, ad-free access to our content and first access to all our guides and content. One day we will surely turn you into a master image processor ;)</p>
<p><strong>Student</strong></p>
<p>Permanent access to as many raw integrations and processed images as we can get. Forever. This is highly discounted for students/kids.  We love students and we want you to enjoy the cosmos.  Enjoy high speed cloud downloads, ad free web content and first access to content.</p>
<p><b>Hobbyist</b></p>
<p>This campaign is for you!  Don't spend 10k+ to get amazing gear and dark skies, supplement your own efforts or just use data collected here and start creating beautiful images! You get access to our imaging calendar, pending requests and first access to all our content and ad-free access to the website. Hobbyist contributors get high speed access to individual subs, calibration frames, calibrated stacks, and any images that we process. </p>
<p><strong>How it's made</strong></p>
<p>This is a premium all in one comprehensive insight into how to do AP, how to everything works with an intimate one on one comprehensive class on Astrophotography.  We'll set up personal sessions with you where you can request specific targets and we'll run through the entire process of acquisition and basic processing with you over a 6-8 hour period of sessions (we're flexible!) - We request that you have a copy of PixInsight already - there is a free trial if you don't already own the software. A computer with Windows 10, Linux or MacOS is required for PixInsight.  We're limiting this session to PixInsight since we're already familiar with the tool and we can help you become familiar too!  You will also get access to everything in our Hobbyist perk for the lifetime of the operation so you will get a ton of data to process!</p>
<ul>
<li>PixInsight - Calibration, Integration &amp; Processing</li>
<li>Sequencing - Planning, Optimizing, Monitoring</li>
<li>Tracking - Calibration, ""Seeing"", Understanding</li>
<li>Understanding SNR &amp; Astrophotography</li>
<li>How/why we have our configuration the way we do + More</li>
<li>Collaborative on one one!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Addon</h3>
<p><strong>How do I do this?</strong></p>
<p>We'll help you figure it out. Buy this addon-on and we'll do a 1:1 online/chat/zoom/virtual collaboration to show you how to process data collected from our observatory!</p>
<p><strong>Custom Target</strong></p>
<p>Want to get a specific target with custom parameters? Choose this addon and we'll get your target on our calendar with your requested parameters! We'll let you know when it's in season, optimum filters, exposures and integration time for best data and you will be the first to get access. If this custom target requires a hardware configuration we're not operating in, we'll let you know when we can swap over.  (Such as 840mm focal length for galaxy season or 545mm focal length for wide field imaging)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Observatory</h3>
<p>Our equipment is already automated and fully operational. Our goal is to image as often as there is clear skies. </p>
<ul>
<li>120mm Triplet Esprit Apochromatic Telescope</li>
<li>Apex .65x Focal Reducer &amp; Flattener (widefield configuration) F4.55 speed at 454mm Focal Length</li>
<li>Esprit Flattener (longer focal length - 840mm)</li>
<li>Optec Flip-Flat - Automated Flats, Flat darks, and robotic lens cover</li>
<li>Pegasus Power - Remote control of power, USB, and automatic Dew Prevention </li>
<li>ZWO ASI2600MC Pro Color APS-C Camera</li>
<li>Triad Ultra,  Optolong L-eXtreme, and Optolog L-Enhance Filters.</li>
<li>Optec precision Robotic Focuser</li>
<li>ZWO Robotic Filter Wheel</li>
<li>Computer with acquisition, weather, sequencing, and cloud-sync software</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600559099/j0t5t57asye8npf7x7dj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We use the ZWO Cooled ASI2600MC Pro Camera. This is a full color aka ""OSC"" Color Camera. We dither between every exposure, run autofocus through temperature changes, and seeing changes.  Our integrations are fully bayer-drizzled so you receive very high-quality data.</p>
<p>The 2600mc pro color camera provides extremely deep well, 16bit ADC, extremely low read noise and high quantum efficiency. It's a very modern sensor that provides extremely detailed, rich, and high-resolution data.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we already have the gear and we're already doing observations in our backyard, the biggest risk is just being up front with what we can achieve. Our goal is to image as much as we can, but that goal is limited by mother nature.</p>
<p><i>Funded/Unfunded</i></p>
<ul>
<li>If we receive enough funding to set up in a dark sky, there will be a short intermission of imaging to move our equipment and set up.</li>
<li>If we don't receive enough funding to set up in a dark sky, we'll continue to image however the imaging sequences will be slightly longer and more involved or we may have to target specific weekends at dark sites for those who purchase custom sequences. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Weather Risk</i></p>
<ul><li>Clouds, Smoke, Bad Weather, Natural disasters.  Heading out to dark skies will make our data much better than I can get near the comfort of our house, but it won't mean mother nature won't strike.</li></ul>
<p><i>Weather Mitigation</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Community - While there may be nights that we can't collect more photons, we'll be happy to collaborate share and be creative. We'll be sure to create content, update guides and just share the cosmos with you. If you purchase a ""How do I "" add-on reward, we'll create an online meeting to collaborate with you on learning the ropes of image processing. Perfect for those rainy nights!</li>
<li>We'll keep an updated observation calendar and notify you if there are long term impacts from weather/smoke/fire/natural disasters.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Moon Risk</i></p>
<ul><li>The moon goes through waxing and waning cycles. It goes from a new moon that is great for broadband imaging (galaxies and dark nebula) to a full moon, which pushes us towards narrowband imaging.</li></ul>
<p><i>Moon Mitigation:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Narrowband Imaging - Our set up currently uses an APS-C cooled astro camera that is full color. We use a Triad Ultra Quadband Narrowband filter during bright moon phases to target objects that emit light in Ha, Hb, OIII and SII.  We love imaging when the moon is up &amp; we'll never waste a cloudless sky.</li>
<li>Broadband Imaging - If most of our targets that are ""in season"" for that month are broadband targets, we'll persevere on. We use the Optolong L-Pro filter which helps mitigate moonlight and skyglow from impacting our ability to image.</li>
<li>Our telescope has a robotic filter wheel that allows us to change filters depending on seeing conditions and imaging parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Equipment Failure</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Things break - our telescope &amp; gear is high quality gear, but it is also running for long durations on a nightly basis. Sometimes bugs will get in, dust will hit, or smoke will dirty our lenses, or we'll have a mechanical or electronic failure.</li>
<li>Covid shipping delays - if anything breaks or needs servicing, there may be delays due to restriction during COVID. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>Equipment Failure Mitigation:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Images are backed up, any consumable parts will be on-site (batteries, USB cables and things that tend to fail open to the elements through the nights), Computer parts.</li>
<li>On-site staff available to respond as needed</li>
<li>Observatory has automatic controls for weather, storms, dust, smoke. Our scope has additional capability such as a robotic cap that can close should we detect any issues before the observatory closes.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone loves to image or wants to stockpile up a bunch of data, but we'd really appreciate if you could share with friends and family who may be interested! I want to share the wonders of the universe with everyone ;)</p>

What We Need & What You Get
The goal of this campaign is to get our equipment to dark skies and share the privilege of such beautiful skies to all. And I mean ALL.
It's that simple!
When it comes to astrophotography ""Signal to Noise Ratios"" mean everything.  In dark skies, we get more signal. With more signal, we have better data. With better data, we spend more time collecting more targets than we do having to spend time to overcome the noise to capture those targets.
Darks skies is ""Win-Win"".
To show what dark skies mean, check out this approximation of the bortle scale.  Most of us live/work in bortle ratings above 6 here in the US unless you live in a rural area. Even if you live in rural areas, you see the ""light domes"" of the cities that are near you. Light pollution is a real problem, but since we can't solve light pollution, we can open dark skies to more people by taking advantage of observatories in these bortle 1-2 zones.

If we make our goal
Our goal is to raise at least $6k to be able to co-locate our fully automated scope in a dark sky, secure and connected observatory for 1/year. The entirety of the $6k will be used to pay for the pier, power, electricity, and internet connectivity in an established & secure observatory with on-site staff to assist, as necessary. 
All the observing equipment is already owned, setup and fully integrated & automated.

If we make 10k, everyone will get 2 years of open data from dark skies!
If we make 15k, everyone will get 3 years of open data! from dark skies
Share this campaign with your friends and family - the more we raise the longer we can have access to dark skies, the more targets we can image and the more data we can share!
If we don't make our goal
We're still going to dark skies.  If we don't meet or exceed our campaign goals then we'll have to restrict our shared data to those who contribute since the costs of making it free for all would be more expensive than I can self-fund. 
So yes, if you commit to any of our rewards, you will get data.  If we don't meet our total goal, then we'll see about other ways we can work on making it happen.
I'm not giving up that easy ;)
We either surpass our goals and help astrophotographers in general, or we raise enough to help those who contributed.
We want to exceed our goals!
That's right, if you share this campaign and we exceed our base goal and hit stretch-goals then everyone receives the extra rewards!
Stretch Goal 1:  10k Raised - 24 months of open data from our dark sky observatory,
Stretch Goal 2: 15k Raid - 36 months of open data from our dark sky observatory,
Our goal is to keep our telescope collecting data every night we can operate. 
Perks
Rewards will start upon conclusion of this campaign, however, there will be a short break with imaging to move our equipment and set up at the new observatory. We'll announce that timeline as we figure out the contract and availability of pier/adapters needed from our vendors.
All Perks
All persons who contribute in any Perk level will receive login access to our website, an ad-free experience when logged in, early access to all content, processing guides, how-to guides and special insider access to everything Astrophotography. We'll share videos of how we acquire images, our scopes operating, how things are set up, how we image, how we choose targets. Our goal is to open the cosmos, but also ensure open access to it.  Not just so you can consume it, but so you can learn from it.
Email
Want to just pitch in a few bucks to help us out? Select an email reward and we'll write you a personalized thank you letter with a little surprise within it! We'll also make sure you never see ads on our website, it's the least we can do!
Open Images
Looking to help us with a bit more money but not interested in processing the data? We'll give you full access to our full high-res images on our fast cloud storage. No more chasing around how to right-click download target or any of that. You get access to the library of all processed images, ad-free access to our content and first access to all our guides and content. One day we will surely turn you into a master image processor ;)
Student
Permanent access to as many raw integrations and processed images as we can get. Forever. This is highly discounted for students/kids.  We love students and we want you to enjoy the cosmos.  Enjoy high speed cloud downloads, ad free web content and first access to content.
Hobbyist
This campaign is for you!  Don't spend 10k+ to get amazing gear and dark skies, supplement your own efforts or just use data collected here and start creating beautiful images! You get access to our imaging calendar, pending requests and first access to all our content and ad-free access to the website. Hobbyist contributors get high speed access to individual subs, calibration frames, calibrated stacks, and any images that we process. 
How it's made
This is a premium all in one comprehensive insight into how to do AP, how to everything works with an intimate one on one comprehensive class on Astrophotography.  We'll set up personal sessions with you where you can request specific targets and we'll run through the entire process of acquisition and basic processing with you over a 6-8 hour period of sessions (we're flexible!) - We request that you have a copy of PixInsight already - there is a free trial if you don't already own the software. A computer with Windows 10, Linux or MacOS is required for PixInsight.  We're limiting this session to PixInsight since we're already familiar with the tool and we can help you become familiar too!  You will also get access to everything in our Hobbyist perk for the lifetime of the operation so you will get a ton of data to process!

Collaborative on one one!

Addon
How do I do this?
We'll help you figure it out. Buy this addon-on and we'll do a 1:1 online/chat/zoom/virtual collaboration to show you how to process data collected from our observatory!
Custom Target
Want to get a specific target with custom parameters? Choose this addon and we'll get your target on our calendar with your requested parameters! We'll let you know when it's in season, optimum filters, exposures and integration time for best data and you will be the first to get access. If this custom target requires a hardware configuration we're not operating in, we'll let you know when we can swap over.  (Such as 840mm focal length for galaxy season or 545mm focal length for wide field imaging)

Observatory
Our equipment is already automated and fully operational. Our goal is to image as often as there is clear skies. 

120mm Triplet Esprit Apochromatic Telescope
Apex .65x Focal Reducer & Flattener (widefield configuration) F4.55 speed at 454mm Focal Length
Esprit Flattener (longer focal length - 840mm)
Optec Flip-Flat - Automated Flats, Flat darks, and robotic lens cover
Pegasus Power - Remote control of power, USB, and automatic Dew Prevention 
ZWO ASI2600MC Pro Color APS-C Camera
Triad Ultra,  Optolong L-eXtreme, and Optolog L-Enhance Filters.
Optec precision Robotic Focuser
ZWO Robotic Filter Wheel
Computer with acquisition, weather, sequencing, and cloud-sync software


We use the ZWO Cooled ASI2600MC Pro Camera. This is a full color aka ""OSC"" Color Camera. We dither between every exposure, run autofocus through temperature changes, and seeing changes.  Our integrations are fully bayer-drizzled so you receive very high-quality data.
The 2600mc pro color camera provides extremely deep well, 16bit ADC, extremely low read noise and high quantum efficiency. It's a very modern sensor that provides extremely detailed, rich, and high-resolution data.  

Risks & Challenges
Since we already have the gear and we're already doing observations in our backyard, the biggest risk is just being up front with what we can achieve. Our goal is to image as much as we can, but that goal is limited by mother nature.
Funded/Unfunded

If we receive enough funding to set up in a dark sky, there will be a short intermission of imaging to move our equipment and set up.
If we don't receive enough funding to set up in a dark sky, we'll continue to image however the imaging sequences will be slightly longer and more involved or we may have to target specific weekends at dark sites for those who purchase custom sequences. 

Weather Risk
Clouds, Smoke, Bad Weather, Natural disasters.  Heading out to dark skies will make our data much better than I can get near the comfort of our house, but it won't mean mother nature won't strike.
Weather Mitigation

Community - While there may be nights that we can't collect more photons, we'll be happy to collaborate share and be creative. We'll be sure to create content, update guides and just share the cosmos with you. If you purchase a ""How do I "" add-on reward, we'll create an online meeting to collaborate with you on learning the ropes of image processing. Perfect for those rainy nights!
We'll keep an updated observation calendar and notify you if there are long term impacts from weather/smoke/fire/natural disasters.

Moon Risk
The moon goes through waxing and waning cycles. It goes from a new moon that is great for broadband imaging (galaxies and dark nebula) to a full moon, which pushes us towards narrowband imaging.
Moon Mitigation:

Narrowband Imaging - Our set up currently uses an APS-C cooled astro camera that is full color. We use a Triad Ultra Quadband Narrowband filter during bright moon phases to target objects that emit light in Ha, Hb, OIII and SII.  We love imaging when the moon is up & we'll never waste a cloudless sky.
Broadband Imaging - If most of our targets that are ""in season"" for that month are broadband targets, we'll persevere on. We use the Optolong L-Pro filter which helps mitigate moonlight and skyglow from impacting our ability to image.
Our telescope has a robotic filter wheel that allows us to change filters depending on seeing conditions and imaging parameters.

Equipment Failure

Things break - our telescope & gear is high quality gear, but it is also running for long durations on a nightly basis. Sometimes bugs will get in, dust will hit, or smoke will dirty our lenses, or we'll have a mechanical or electronic failure.
Covid shipping delays - if anything breaks or needs servicing, there may be delays due to restriction during COVID. 

Equipment Failure Mitigation:

Images are backed up, any consumable parts will be on-site (batteries, USB cables and things that tend to fail open to the elements through the nights), Computer parts.
On-site staff available to respond as needed
Observatory has automatic controls for weather, storms, dust, smoke. Our scope has additional capability such as a robotic cap that can close should we detect any issues before the observatory closes.

 

Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everyone loves to image or wants to stockpile up a bunch of data, but we'd really appreciate if you could share with friends and family who may be interested! I want to share the wonders of the universe with everyone ;)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>Hello.  My name is Aaron.  In early 2010, my wife and I separated, and eventually divorced.  I had to move in with my father on Whidbey Island in Washington State.  For the first year I was quite depressed, and I had no desire to have any real friends.<br/><br/>But then I met Heather.<br/><br/>We hit it off right away, and started working on various projects together.  It started with theater set building (her passion at the time), and later on we were doing odd jobs together.  She was the best friend that could have asked for.  She helped me through so many things.<br/><br/>In the Spring of 2012, I was offered a job in Oregon, and moved away from my best friend.  It was hard, but it was the best thing for me at the time.<br/><br/><b>And now, Heather's recent story.<br/><br/></b>In the last year or so, it was found that Heather had a large tumor growing in her jaw bone.  The removing the tumor with take reconstructive surgery over time.  Currently she is seeing a Chinese medicine doctor, who specializes in reduction of tumors. She also has a tumor in her sinus cavity.  These two tumors cause her to suffer from headaches that are similar to migraines. Her most recent scan showed a decrease in their size, but also revealed a new one in her frontal lobe.  None of them can be treated with chemo or radiation.  The only western medicine option is removal.  She has been on pain medication and unable to work for 6 months.  Acupuncture has been found to relieve the pain.  <br/><br/>Her new pain free clarity has given her a new way of seeing the world.  She is finding beauty in things that she used to take for granted.  She has decided to photograph all the beauty that she sees, so that she may share it with others.  It is her new found passion.  And to be quite honest, she has a natural talent for catching the perfect shot.<br/><br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I would like to do for Heather...<br/>
</h3>I am hoping to fund a road-trip for Heather and her little dog Sophie.  I would like to be able to rent them an RV, and let them explore the Western United States.  Taking pictures along the way.  I would like to raise enough money to be able to pay for the following:<br/><ul>
<li>RV rental for two weeks<br/>
</li>
<li>Gas</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Additional camera equipment (if needed)</li>
<li>....and any miscellaneous items that she may need along the way.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>She deserves it...<br/>
</h3>I wish that I could express to her how much she has helped me through the few years that I have known her, but I am not as good with words as I would like to be.  She is such a loving and caring people person.  She can strike up a conversation with any stranger, and be their best friend in 15 minutes.  She is always willing to help in any way that she can.  I think it is time that I return the kindness.  If I could fund this journey on my own, I would.  That is why I enlist the help of caring strangers.  I have seen the good that this community has done.<br/><p></p>

Hello.  My name is Aaron.  In early 2010, my wife and I separated, and eventually divorced.  I had to move in with my father on Whidbey Island in Washington State.  For the first year I was quite depressed, and I had no desire to have any real friends.But then I met Heather.We hit it off right away, and started working on various projects together.  It started with theater set building (her passion at the time), and later on we were doing odd jobs together.  She was the best friend that could have asked for.  She helped me through so many things.In the Spring of 2012, I was offered a job in Oregon, and moved away from my best friend.  It was hard, but it was the best thing for me at the time.And now, Heather's recent story.In the last year or so, it was found that Heather had a large tumor growing in her jaw bone.  The removing the tumor with take reconstructive surgery over time.  Currently she is seeing a Chinese medicine doctor, who specializes in reduction of tumors. She also has a tumor in her sinus cavity.  These two tumors cause her to suffer from headaches that are similar to migraines. Her most recent scan showed a decrease in their size, but also revealed a new one in her frontal lobe.  None of them can be treated with chemo or radiation.  The only western medicine option is removal.  She has been on pain medication and unable to work for 6 months.  Acupuncture has been found to relieve the pain.  Her new pain free clarity has given her a new way of seeing the world.  She is finding beauty in things that she used to take for granted.  She has decided to photograph all the beauty that she sees, so that she may share it with others.  It is her new found passion.  And to be quite honest, she has a natural talent for catching the perfect shot.

What I would like to do for Heather...
I am hoping to fund a road-trip for Heather and her little dog Sophie.  I would like to be able to rent them an RV, and let them explore the Western United States.  Taking pictures along the way.  I would like to raise enough money to be able to pay for the following:
RV rental for two weeks

Gas
Food
Additional camera equipment (if needed)
....and any miscellaneous items that she may need along the way.




She deserves it...
I wish that I could express to her how much she has helped me through the few years that I have known her, but I am not as good with words as I would like to be.  She is such a loving and caring people person.  She can strike up a conversation with any stranger, and be their best friend in 15 minutes.  She is always willing to help in any way that she can.  I think it is time that I return the kindness.  If I could fund this journey on my own, I would.  That is why I enlist the help of caring strangers.  I have seen the good that this community has done.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>The Story</b></h3>
<p>About 100 years ago, people arrived with dreams to begin new lives, and what followed is one of the most dramatic periods of change in recent history in North America. This book tells one part of that story.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849036/files/20140911005923-08-Indiegogo-campaign-Prairie-Sunset-_DSC7640web65.jpg?1410422363"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's a book about hope and dreams, hardship and survival, family and community, and most recently, rapid change. Through the words of the people interviewed, this book explores some of the changes over the past 100 years, and it highlights the richness of lifestyle on the small family farm. This is a story we are all connected to.<br/></p>
<p>The words of the people I talked with have great meaning, and are straight from the heart. Hearing what these people had to say helped me understand what they went through, and the importance of this story. Their words are intertwined with full-page photos I've taken of what remains from this fascinating era of rapid change, of the past 100 years or so.</p>
<p>And there were surprises for me. Hidden within the words of the people were details that hinted of survival, self-sufficiency, and food preservation before the days of household electricity and refrigeration. And more.</p>
<p>The photography I've done for this book is of old buildings and other artifacts, left behind from this fascinating era. Much of this is rapidly vanishing. I believe that more of this needs to be somehow preserved, before it is gone forever.</p>

A top-quality hardcover photo-book that is 10 years in the making. Photographs of a past way of life, with about 70 people sharing their thoughts about the change.


The Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign to publish the book was a success and the book officially became available for sale to the public at the book launch on November 25, 2015. The publishing was delayed through much of 2015, but resulted in a book that's 240 pages, with debossed cover artwork, printed and bound at Friesens, one of the world's finest bookmakers.
Books can be ordered at this website: www.prairiesunset.ca
If you are interested in buying a fine-art print, or would like updates, please email me at this link: dion@earthpics.ca


You can follow the Facebook page for this project by “Liking” the page: https://www.facebook.com/prairiesunsetbook




The video above tells the story. Please click here for video on youtube.



I'll be posting Indiegogo Updates, which can be seen in the Update menu, and are also emailed automatically to contributors.

Your contribution, and your help in spreading the word is what makes crowdfunding work. Thank you!

            ----------------------------------

The photography and writing for this book are completed. This campaign is to raise enough money to publish this book. 

Professionally designed, it will be printed by one of the highest-quality book printers in North America.



Info about the ""Perks""-- (see the boxes on the right). They are closed now, but remain as a reference to the prices during the campaign. Shipping was included in the prices, and during the campaign I subsidizing the cost of mail and GST in most cases. Price for the book now is $59 plus shipping plus GST if applicable. 




                                                            •••••••

The Story
About 100 years ago, people arrived with dreams to begin new lives, and what followed is one of the most dramatic periods of change in recent history in North America. This book tells one part of that story.

It's a book about hope and dreams, hardship and survival, family and community, and most recently, rapid change. Through the words of the people interviewed, this book explores some of the changes over the past 100 years, and it highlights the richness of lifestyle on the small family farm. This is a story we are all connected to.
The words of the people I talked with have great meaning, and are straight from the heart. Hearing what these people had to say helped me understand what they went through, and the importance of this story. Their words are intertwined with full-page photos I've taken of what remains from this fascinating era of rapid change, of the past 100 years or so.
And there were surprises for me. Hidden within the words of the people were details that hinted of survival, self-sufficiency, and food preservation before the days of household electricity and refrigeration. And more.
The photography I've done for this book is of old buildings and other artifacts, left behind from this fascinating era. Much of this is rapidly vanishing. I believe that more of this needs to be somehow preserved, before it is gone forever.
                                                            •••••••







192 pages - full-page photos intermixed with quoted words of people who I talked to about the past (their permission is granted to publish their words)

11 x 11 inches - full-colour, hardcover photography book, professionally designed, with highest quality print and materials
Book printed in Canada by Friesens Book Division, one of the finest book manufacturers in North America, in business over 100 years
Fine art prints are with fade-resistant pigment inks on heavy archival cotton rag paper, intended for framing or other display
                                                            •••••••
Your support in buying a book, a fine art print, or in helping to spread the word is greatly appreciated.
Also please consider if this book may be an appropriate gift for anyone who is interested in the story or photographs.




Fine art prints


Fine art prints are available now. Please see the Perks on the right. Also if you want a size or combination you don't see, please email me at dion@earthpics.ca
All prints are on heavy archival cotton rag paper using fade-resistant pigment inks, and are suitable for framing and long-term display. Careful count is kept of prints that are sold, and they will be available in limited quantities.
Special care will be taken to protect the print during transit. They will be shipped flat, with reinforcement. Prices listed here include shipping, and are special prices offered only during this campaign.








The cost, and what you get in return:

 
The photography, writing, and most of the work in creating the book are done. This project was self-funded. All that remains is to publish it. 
You will get a very high quality book. This book will be independently published because I want to ensure the quality of the book is of the highest standard, and the book is as I envision it, and printed in North America.
High-quality print jobs like this cost tens of thousands of dollars at a minimum, and a minimum of 1000 must be printed.
Delivery date for the book and prints are probably after Christmas, but I will do my very best to make it in time for Christmas. I will post updates to everyone on this Indiegogo page.


Photos below are of a prototype similar to the final version. Cover design will be an embedded photo, with embossed text.





The financial side-- and if the funding goal is exceeded:


The  minimum funding goal of $37,000 is needed to print a small run of 1000, and to cover the costs of shipping the books that are pre-ordered.
The displayed costs are all-inclusive, and the price of the book is comparable to other photo-books in bookstores. The print quality of this book will be higher than many photo-books in bookstores.
I've taken 8 long road trips across the prairies for this project. I've taken thousands of photos (from which I've chosen over 100 for this book). I've interviewed over 70 people, who have passionately told me about the past way of life in the rural prairies, and this project has been entirely self-funded. Most people agree it's an important topic that needs to be captured and preserved, before it's gone.

There is no upper limit. If the funding hits higher amounts, then the print run will be increased, and more features will be added to fit the budget. Everyone will benefit from this. This helps make this model of publishing a success.

Above all, I need help in spreading the word. The greatest challenge of this entire crowdfunding campaign is reaching enough people who might be interested.





Shipping and delivery info


Shipping costs are included in the prices, but in most cases I am subsidizing the cost, because shipping is more expensive than ever. I've lowered the cost for orders of more than one book per shipment, where bulk shipping is beneficial to both of us.

Shipping from Canada, to countries outside North America, is absurdly expensive. I've had to create separate categories with prices that reflect these costs. I don't make money from shipping, and it's usually at a loss to me.





My personal background

I grew up on a small farm in Saskatchewan, Canada. My grandparents were pioneers who came from Europe, and settled as homesteaders. While I grew up on our small family farm, exploring the whole area on our bicycles, nothing was beyond the limits of our imagination, and we invented anything we wanted. With all the neighbours, friends, and family who were living nearby, I had a blast.






My professional background



I've always had a blend of interests and employment across the arts and sciences. From the time I was a little kid growing up on the small family farm we had, I've been an inventor in spirit, and continually search for new ideas and personal growth.
I have been involved in photography, writing, prepress, and publishing for over 20 years. In these areas I've strived for high levels of production quality, and in ensuring that the story satisfies our eyes, our minds, and our hearts.


If this book is a success, then I will produce other books of similar quality, and I will help others tell their stories as well.





Please help spread the word, to make this possible



 Books of fine quality and compelling stories easily sell thousands of copies, over time. But for this campaign to work, I need to have 500 or more presales before the deadline-- a very short period of time! The hard part is reaching large numbers of people quickly. That's why I need your help.

The bus will be equipped with full studio lights, so I can perfectly capture you. The Workstation: A set of solar panels and deep cell batteries, coupled with my computer, turn this bus into a mobile workstation enabling me to edit while I travel. The Business: With all that The Portrait Bus contains, I will be able to post up with the bus at weddings, events, art fairs, festivals, wineries, and more to produce beautiful 5x7 prints people can take home, right there, direct from the bus. The Art: Given The Portrait Bus's proclivity for long drives, and it's unique containment of everything I need to work, I will be able to pursue my own artistic directives driving across, and photographing, America and the people whose path I cross. Join the revolution. We can bring back the print! By donating to my campaign you are helping me #bringbacktheprint!I am a firm believer that people should see their lives and also, be able to hold their tangible memories. Photographs are a way of capturing a point in time, yet we hardly print images these days. You should be able to take a step back in time and have photographic proof that you existed that isn't tethered to our phone.  We have the technology! With your help and my vision we can turn The Portrait Bus from a dream into a reality. Still with me team? Great.Here is the game plan. My total budget for bus renovations comes to $20,000 - I am here to raise $10,000 and I will match up to $10,000 with my own money.Your donations will go to building out the bus: custom woodwork, solar panels and power grid, printer, paper, ink and gear that will be required for the photo booth. Funds will also go to website design and marketing. I am already halfway there and preparations to build have already begun but I need your help to finish!Perks!I have some amazing perks that I am excited to offer! If you donate as little as $15 you get stickers of the bus logo and #bringbacktheprint. If you have an event in your future you can book it through this campaign to get a discount on services. I am also offering tickets to the launch event where there will be music, snacks and most importantly a fully functioning photo booth bus that prints pictures! I will also be creating signed post cards of my special wanderlust series, specifically designed for this fundraiser. You can view these images in the gallery under the video. These are the 5 images you will receive in the post card pack.What happens if you don't reach your goal? (Great questions everyone)If I don’t reach my goal...(thoughtful pause)...  well that’s ok! I’m still going to take the funds generated and continue to build my dream. I believe in the bus and I believe in giving people tangible memories of themselves. I believe that everyone should value who they are and where they have been. I want to be the photographer who can give you prints, right then and there.If you can’t help with a monetary donation, no worries! There are many other ways you can help The Portrait Bus. You can share this page with your network, you can tell your friend who is getting married about this sweet wedding combo deal. You can drop me a line and say that you enjoyed reading about this, because all artists who are putting their work out there need the validation to help makes us produce more art. Really, anything helps. If you made it this far...From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU SO MUCH for reading about my project and contributing in any way you can. I am so excited to get this dream moving and shaking and bring the bus to you!See you on the road.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>**UPDATE** <em>Thank you to all who have contributed so far. We have decided that, as well as donating a portion of all money raised during this fundraiser to Red Cross, we will also be providing a free family portrait and 8x10"" print to anyone whose photos and albums were lost or destroyed in the recent floods.</em></p>
<p>The recent flooding has left our new studio in need of yet more renovations, as well as new backdrops, props and more. To raise funds in time for our grand opening, we're selling off goods and services at discounted prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photography lessons</li>
<li>Portrait sessions</li>
<li>Prints from Raj's three days spent in the SE and SW of the city photographing the disaster</li>
<li>Rental time in our studio</li>
<li>VIP tickets to our grand opening celebration, where you'll get martinis, music, photo ops with local celebrities and more</li>
</ul>
<p>But we're not the only ones who have been affected — in fact, we were lucky not to lose any of our electronics at all. So we've decided that for every $100 we raise, $20 will be donated to the Alberta Red Cross to help those who lost it all to these devastating waters.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the course of our renovations, we've faced setback after setback trying to take an old, slummy building and make it meet the province's building code as well as our own exacting standards. We were already behind schedule and over budget, and the flood was the straw that broke our collective back. We need help with finishing up Calgary's largest and most glamorous studio, and in exchange we'll give you all the goodies you need in your photo-related lives. A general breakdown of the average $100 donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, $20 goes to the Red Cross to help other Alberta flood victims</li>
<li>$20 to $30 goes to our overheads while we keep supplying eager learners with lessons, daycares with picture days and family portraits with our mobile studio, as well as costs related to your donation incentive (lessons, portraits, prints, etc.)</li>
<li>$40 goes towards our renovations</li>
<li>$10 to $20 is put towards making the most epic Grand Opening celebration Calgary's ever seen</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us rebuild, you're helping us bring these beautiful realities to Calgary:</p>
<p><strong>The Rental Studio:</strong> Calgary's a city of creatives, and not every hobbyist or amateur photographer can afford to buy all the top-of-the-line equipment they see in Pop Photo magazines. And not every photographer knows where to go when they want to do an in-studio session. That's why we've put such a focus on making our massive studio rental-friendly; as they say in Latin America, nuestro casa es tu casa. By providing more than any other rental studio in the area, and at a more affordable price than most, we feel we can give back to the community and support budding talent in a way we weren't when we were learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three lighting setups tailored to your style, including up to eight studio strobes or five off-camera hotshoe flashes, all wirelessly triggered by any standard-hotshoe or PC-enabled camera</li>
<li>Your choice of a rainbow of 10-12' wide, 20-36' long backdrops, including green screen</li>
<li>Rent one of three 13x20' bays, or get a bit of extra privacy and breathing room by renting the entire 1000 sq. ft. studio area by the hour or by the day</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Portraits:</strong> It's easy for a mall studio to get stuck in a rut: Nail down the lighting system and tear off the adjustment knobs. Lock the camera. Teach a monkey and/or high-school student to focus the camera, fire the shutter and sell print bundles, and you can sit on the beach in Rio and collect profit cheques. But what does that mean for you? Sub-par family portraits. And that just won't do. At Scratch, we don't have employees. We have partners, each with a deep and thorough knowledge of lighting and technical photography. Also, we're fun. Would you rather have an off-centre, awkwardly-cropped, pose-and-grin family portrait or a series of dramatically-lit photos of each member of your family drop-kicking a mango? Odd example, but I'm sure you get the idea. We like to do the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising and Stock:</strong> Yes, Calgary is home to iStockPhoto. But what if you don't want to use the same obscure stock photo as your competitor for your ad? Want something that looks a little more...local? Personal? We do that. Have you seen the photo our lead photographer took of his own baby girl screaming in a vat of pasta to help sell vegetarianism? No? It's on our site. Either way, what we're saying is that we hear your message and we commit. Need some fluorescent paint thrown at some live doves while meat cookies explode from the diamond-encrusted background? No problem. Need a photo of your star employee with the Calgary skyline in the background? Done. Need a model and/or hair and makeup services to capture the perfect scene as you've seen it in your dreams? We've got you covered. Just give us a call.</p>
<p><strong>VIP and Promotional sessions:</strong> Our studio comes complete with a shower, makeup counter, hair and makeup services, and all the coffee and martinis you could ask for. With a VIP session with Scratch, you'll be pampered and primmed ahead of your photo session, including an in-studio session as well as up to four other locations around the city — all reached via limo. Perfect for talent, executives of any kind and honeymooners.</p>
<p><strong>Weddings:</strong> Every wedding package we offer includes a three-location engagement session, as well as an hour of post-honeymoon studio time; makeup and hair services and photo booths at your reception are a little extra but well worth the investment. Got something out of the ordinary? Good. Themed weddings are our specialty.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> We do it all. Daycares, grad photos, band promos, event coverage, budoir, babies, architectural; photojournalism to product photography. But we could do it all better if our studio was finished.</p>

<h3>Photo Workshops by Kevin+Pansa</h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507788945/z2pgswm3ph1ihmi5yk9p.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>If you enjoy photography and travel we are the perfect vacation choice for you. Come, stay with us, experience exploring northern Thailand while learning to capture your adventures with stunning photographs that will be worth publishing.</p>

<h3>Suan Sook Boutique Resort</h3>
<p>We have purchased 3000 square meters (just under 1 acre) of land and begun building a boutique homestay/studio/gallery and guest accommodation. We are also incorporating Glamping (glamorous camping) on our property. All aimed at providing a base for our travel photography workshops.</p>
<p>The organic gardens and orchard are being laid out to be as photogenic as possible so that at every turn there's a new photo opportunity. We will be providing our guests with home cooked meals and the option to learn some country Thai cooking during their stay with us.</p>
<p>Surrounding us are farms and orchards and it's a wonderful location to explore on foot or by bicycle. Further up the mountain there's walking tracks, waterfalls, caves, hill tribe markets and villages, look-out points the Doi Inthanon Royal Project gardens and much more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507792026/xo7okjjcvewbhs1ql5fg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Complete Photography Experience</h3>
<p>A course of 365 easy steps and broken down into manageable, bite-sized lessons so it's easily digested and enjoyable. Don't worry! It's not a regular course you must finish all the lesson to gain the benefit from. We've designed it in modules so where ever you are on your photographic journey you can pick an appropriate module and continue to learn and grow as a photographer.</p>
<p>Based on the well known 365-day photography challenge this course is fashioned to encourage you to use your camera frequently. Anyone who's participated in our workshops will know this is something I am big on. The more frequently you are using your camera the more you will get to know the controls and settings, the more you will enjoy photography and the more creative you will become with it.</p>
<p>Lessons consist of essential teaching presented in video format, along with example photos, diagrams, and animations to clearly illustrate each step being taught. Accompanying each lesson is an experiment so you can put into practice what your learning and solidify it into your experience.</p>
<p>Each step is short and to the point, taking only about 5 minutes to digest, (so ideal for watching on your smartphone as you commute to school or work.) The experiments can take as little as ten minutes or as long as you have time for, (easy to work on during your lunch break.)</p>

<h3>Why Are We Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>We have a dream of creating a most beautiful and photogenic surrounding for our guests to come and enjoy. Either to just be in and relax or to be busy in photographing a vast selection of flowers, birds, insects, landscapes etc. and also enjoying what the nearby national park has to offer.</p>
<p>Our desire is to share our passion for photography and for northern Thailand. Being able to teach people about the local culture, cuisine and lifestyle will bring our guests into a unique travel experience. Teaching them how to record their memories with stunning photographs will enable them to cherish the experience forever.</p>

<h3>The Impact You Will Have</h3>
<p>Funding our project with your help will allow us to employ locals to get the work done for us quickly and also install an efficient water management system so we can irrigate our organic gardens, (which is vital during the dry season.)</p>
<p>We are already becoming part of the local community. The district head man has reached out to us and invited us to integrate into village life, (which has totally put aside any anxiety I had of moving to this rural location and being accepted as a foreigner here.) He's impressed on us to that we are expected to join in with village life, smile and talk with people, go to their funerals when they die, take part in community events and generally participate. We are thrilled about this! We have already been employing the locals to work with us and want to do this more frequently as it genuinely helps us become a part of the community.</p>
<p>By employing locals we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>More readily integrate into the local community</li>
<li>Provide much needed additional income for low earning local farmers</li>
<li>Complete the landscaping in a realistic time frame</li>
<li>Free us up to complete our new course</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on how successful our campaign is we will also be able to drill a well, install a solar energy system and build further guest accommodation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507789662/gxbm8ycd76kqlvfq9nr6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Becoming Local</h3>
<p>Having already made friends with quite a lot of the locals and with the recent encouragement of the district headman to integrate into the community, we are feeling better than ever about being in the location we've chosen to build.</p>
<p>Most everyone in the area farms rice and peanuts or has a longan orchard and many are curious as to how we plan to use our land. We've talked with them about what we do and that we'll be offering accommodation. They are watching us and are interested to learn how to emulate our business model. Even before we bought our land some of them have been researching how the village can become part of the booming tourism industry and have visited other districts where farmers are offering homestay accommodation to tourists.</p>
<p>Being so close to the Doi Inthanon National Park it is an ideal place to be offering accommodation because the park is so popular with both Thai and foreign tourists, but lodging within the park is scarce.</p>
<p>We are more than happy to share our experience and encouragement with them to help build up the local economy. Many of their children are now educated and no longer interested in working the family farm, so it makes good business sense to provide accommodation in such a beautiful part of Thailand.</p>

Pansa and I are photographers and photography teachers based in northern Thailand. We teach in-person workshops and online.
I started my career as a news photographer and it has spanned more than three decades with experience in editorial, commercial, documentary, travel, and many other photography genres. Pansa is a travel, documentary and art photographer and a fine teacher.
We love passing on our passion so much we are building a boutique resort in rural northern Thailand where we can create and teach our workshops. Come and experience it with us.
If you enjoy photography and travel we are the perfect vacation choice for you. Come, stay with us, experience exploring northern Thailand while learning to capture your adventures with stunning photographs that will be worth publishing.
The location, just next to Doi Inthanon National Park, (one of the most popular national parks in Thailand,) is prime for photography. The park is full of wonderful places to photograph and presents endless opportunity to learn. We are connecting with local guides and our immediate community to join together to enrich your experience staying with us.

Keep reading to discover how our Indiegogo perks will help you grow your skills and become a more accomplished photographer.
Suan Sook Boutique Resort
We have purchased 3000 square meters (just under 1 acre) of land and begun building a boutique homestay/studio/gallery and guest accommodation. We are also incorporating Glamping (glamorous camping) on our property. All aimed at providing a base for our travel photography workshops.
The organic gardens and orchard are being laid out to be as photogenic as possible so that at every turn there's a new photo opportunity. We will be providing our guests with home cooked meals and the option to learn some country Thai cooking during their stay with us.
Surrounding us are farms and orchards and it's a wonderful location to explore on foot or by bicycle. Further up the mountain there's walking tracks, waterfalls, caves, hill tribe markets and villages, look-out points the Doi Inthanon Royal Project gardens and much more.

The Complete Photography Experience
A course of 365 easy steps and broken down into manageable, bite-sized lessons so it's easily digested and enjoyable. Don't worry! It's not a regular course you must finish all the lesson to gain the benefit from. We've designed it in modules so where ever you are on your photographic journey you can pick an appropriate module and continue to learn and grow as a photographer.
Based on the well known 365-day photography challenge this course is fashioned to encourage you to use your camera frequently. Anyone who's participated in our workshops will know this is something I am big on. The more frequently you are using your camera the more you will get to know the controls and settings, the more you will enjoy photography and the more creative you will become with it.
Lessons consist of essential teaching presented in video format, along with example photos, diagrams, and animations to clearly illustrate each step being taught. Accompanying each lesson is an experiment so you can put into practice what your learning and solidify it into your experience.
Each step is short and to the point, taking only about 5 minutes to digest, (so ideal for watching on your smartphone as you commute to school or work.) The experiments can take as little as ten minutes or as long as you have time for, (easy to work on during your lunch break.)
For more details about this course please visit our website.

Why Are We Crowdfunding?
We have a dream of creating a most beautiful and photogenic surrounding for our guests to come and enjoy. Either to just be in and relax or to be busy in photographing a vast selection of flowers, birds, insects, landscapes etc. and also enjoying what the nearby national park has to offer.
Our desire is to share our passion for photography and for northern Thailand. Being able to teach people about the local culture, cuisine and lifestyle will bring our guests into a unique travel experience. Teaching them how to record their memories with stunning photographs will enable them to cherish the experience forever.

The Impact You Will Have
Funding our project with your help will allow us to employ locals to get the work done for us quickly and also install an efficient water management system so we can irrigate our organic gardens, (which is vital during the dry season.)
We are already becoming part of the local community. The district head man has reached out to us and invited us to integrate into village life, (which has totally put aside any anxiety I had of moving to this rural location and being accepted as a foreigner here.) He's impressed on us to that we are expected to join in with village life, smile and talk with people, go to their funerals when they die, take part in community events and generally participate. We are thrilled about this! We have already been employing the locals to work with us and want to do this more frequently as it genuinely helps us become a part of the community.
By employing locals we will:

More readily integrate into the local community
Provide much needed additional income for low earning local farmers
Complete the landscaping in a realistic time frame
Free us up to complete our new course

Depending on how successful our campaign is we will also be able to drill a well, install a solar energy system and build further guest accommodation.


Becoming Local
Having already made friends with quite a lot of the locals and with the recent encouragement of the district headman to integrate into the community, we are feeling better than ever about being in the location we've chosen to build.
Most everyone in the area farms rice and peanuts or has a longan orchard and many are curious as to how we plan to use our land. We've talked with them about what we do and that we'll be offering accommodation. They are watching us and are interested to learn how to emulate our business model. Even before we bought our land some of them have been researching how the village can become part of the booming tourism industry and have visited other districts where farmers are offering homestay accommodation to tourists.
Being so close to the Doi Inthanon National Park it is an ideal place to be offering accommodation because the park is so popular with both Thai and foreign tourists, but lodging within the park is scarce.
We are more than happy to share our experience and encouragement with them to help build up the local economy. Many of their children are now educated and no longer interested in working the family farm, so it makes good business sense to provide accommodation in such a beautiful part of Thailand.

<p>My name is Davor Zupičić. I'm a Cinematography and Photography student at the Academy of Dramatic Art of the University of Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525876887/zqihyl7w7rfzsdqpakmd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've been working on 35mm film photography for the past eight years and continue to choose it for important projects.</p>
<p>As a topic of a photographic essay, I have decided to study the need for an organized animal shelter. Out of several major cities in Croatia, the capital city Zagreb is the best example. It has <strong>Dumovec</strong>, a city funded and organized animal shelter. Other cities, however, do not follow in its path.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525877008/ujckcdgroppdwx8ele7p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Cities such as Rijeka, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Slavonski brod fail to provide better conditions. Dubrovnik is world-famous for its tourism and wonderful scenery and in all the wealth the tourist season brings, they have no animal shelter. Rijeka has a citizen-organized shelter which is on the verge of being illegal - if the city does not have a shelter it can also arrange to have an existing facility take care of the animals (the shelter in Lič, relatively close to Rijeka). <a data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"" href=""http://www.ebrod.net/slavonski-brod/clanak/azil-za-zivotinje-radi-se-tri-godine-potroseno-je-18-milijuna-a-jos-ne-radi-23741.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slavonski Brod is an example where politics have had their say - millions have been invested into building the shelter and still, after several years of construction, it is not operational.</a></p>
<p>It is very important to focus on this issue - <a data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"" href=""http://www.index.hr/black/clanak/ministarstvo-zatvara-horor-skloniste-u-belom-manastiru-u-kojem-psi-jedu-pse/1038172.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the shelter in the town Beli Manastir has been recently <strong>closed</strong> for horrendous living conditions</a> (dogs eating each other).

<p>Like any photography project, materials are costly and consist of <strong>35mm films </strong>(<strong>Fuji Pro400H</strong>), <strong>C-41 Development</strong> and <b>Scanning</b> of the negatives.</p>
<p>Also included are the travelling costs from Zagreb to Dumovec. As the project is finalized, I will organize public exhibitions.</p>
<p>Perks that you can acquire are prints of my previous photographs. For now, you can see my work on <a data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"" href=""https://500px.com/davorz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my 500px.com portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>Funding required for this project is <strong>1000€</strong> and will be split into photographic materials, travelling costs and final prints for exhibition.</p>
<p><i><u><strong>ADDITION TO THIS SECTION SINCE THE FIRST UPDATE</strong></u></i></p>
<p>I have received several questions regarding funding - I want to clear it up. It is also in the first campaign update, so here it goes:</p>
<p>The required funding (<strong>$1000</strong>) reflects the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>purchasing <strong>one</strong> 35mm film <strong>Fuji PRO400H</strong> which in Croatia is sold for <strong>$12 </strong>in stores, but can be bought online for about <strong>$9</strong>. I have been making photographs on film since 2010 when I first picked up a film camera and simply love the medium. I believe a story like this should be and deserves to be told on film. This specific film is wonderful - it provides beautiful colors and good results even if technically the photograph is not perfect.</li>
<li>After a film roll is completed, it needs to be developed in standardized chemical process called <strong>C-41</strong>. Development and a basic scan of each film costs about <strong>$8</strong>. Basic scan means that this quality is purely for preview - this photograph cannot be printed on a large scale while retaining its characteristics and information - even on a very small format, loss of quality is noticeable. Quality of the print, among other things can be connected with the quality of the scan. A high resolution scan is priced at around <strong>$12 </strong>- but fortunately I can scan my negatives at the Academy where I study photography. I use the previews to see which photographs are good.</li>
<li>Travelling costs. Fortunately, I live close to the center of Zagreb and own a car (my parents'). One round-trip costs about <strong>$6</strong> if only <i>fuel consumption</i> is calculated. This cost is an estimate, but a fairly accurate one.</li>
<li>Printing costs. In order to have an exhibition, I want to produce quality prints. For now, however, it is impossible to put a price for now. Quality prints are done on Hahnemühle paper and there are several print shops in Zagreb and prices there range from <strong>$20/print </strong>to <strong>$30/print</strong>, and that's not even counting the frame (if  it is even involved in the end). For now, I'd ask you to set aside this section as it clearly needs some testing. I need to run some tests once I have the final photographs.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, these are the <i>planned expenses</i>. I can't tell you that I'm going to shoot through 100 rolls of film since film is not meant to be used like that for a project like this. Film is a slow, beautiful medium, it takes time and devotion. Since I started photographing this subject, I have gone through <strong>7</strong><strong> films</strong> - and I was being extremely careful with that because I was paying for everything by myself. I plan out my photographs and have a vision what I'm trying to capture, even though I want to be surprised as well by what I find through the viewfinder. If you want to put it into strict numbers, one film is a combined expense of <strong>$17</strong> (providing that the scan included is for previews and not the final scan for which I will have to invest hours into in order to make the photograph completely ready for print).</p>
<p>I will be spending more and more time in the shelter. So far every time I have been there, I stayed for a couple of hours. I want to go more often and spend more time. One very important aspect of this project is to follow the employees who bring the abandoned animals into the shelter so I will be going with them as well.</p>
<p>Also, an important notice: some of you might notice that the goal for this project is based on <strong>flexible funding </strong>- this means that even if the goal is not achieved, the campaign will receive the funds. <a data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"" href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/205138007-Choose-Your-Funding-Type-Can-I-Keep-My-Money-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can read more about it here.</a> Short version is: I will accept all the help I can get. In example for fixed funding, if this campaign raised less than the goal, all the donations would be refunded and then this project would definitely be extremely hard to complete on my own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">The Impact</h3>
<p>It has been known through the decades of journalistic photography that a photograph carries strong influence. It has the power to change things, shift focus. With my photographs, I don't intend on focusing on the ""cuteness"" of animals - but on the need for basic living conditions and healthcare.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525877514/rigpsezbex9glplnrijr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I realize you're not donating directly to a shelter. You're donating to a photography project which puts focus on the issue of conditions in which animals live inside these shelters. Imagine if you lived in a shack with occasional food and a visitor or two. This is not normal - everyone needs  to feel safe and these animals are no different.</p>
<p>Consider helping in any way you can. You can choose my photographs through <strong>perks</strong> - my previous photographic series <i>Lujzijana</i> is about the old road that connected cities of Rijeka and Zagreb.</p>
<p>I plan to include new perks regarding the upcoming photographs so stay tuned for <strong>updates</strong>!</p>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">Project Timeline</h3>
<p>As this project grows, I have prepared a project timeline in order to help you see how quickly you can expect to see specific results.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526423707/vz04exfodsid1yuw9ooz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For now, this is the plan. One adjustment I might do is that I'd like to begin visiting other shelters in Croatia. This would be a big step for me so I will play it pretty close to the chest. For now it will remain on the drawing board as I first want to complete this project and then after it's done, I would maybe expand in that direction.</p>

<p>I realize not everyone can help financially. If you have unused <strong>Fuji Pro400H </strong>35mm films, every little bit helps. Also I'd like to ask you to share as much as you can - think of every animal organization which cares about shelter conditions.</p>
<p>After everything, I'd like to thank you for reading this! I hope this encourages you to get more involved with helping animals and investing in animal shelters. They all need care, medical assistance and food. They're like us!</p>

<h3>The exhibition</h3>
<p>The exhibition will feature 20 Greek photographers work on the theme HOME curated by Magnum photographer Jacob Aue Sobol and editor by Sun Hee Engesltoft. The photographers have worked on the theme HOME since the workshop last summer and has now each completed a series dealing with HOME. How is HOME in Greece right now? What is HOME to me? How does is look? How does HOME feel? Is HOME a place i want to stay? All these questions and many more have the artist asked themselves, and the exhibition is the result of their search for the meaning of HOME. </p>
<p>Each photographer will show 1-15 pictures in different sizes printet on Hahnemühle 280gr fine art paper. The exhibition will be at a venue called Casa Bianca in the city of Thessaloniki in the central part of Greece. Thessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece after Athens with a population around 800.000. The venue Casa Bianca is the best exhibition place in Thessaloniki and used to host some of the most prominent exhibitions in Greece.  The Casa Bianca is a grand villa built in 1912 and is now funcitioning as  a municipal art gallery.

<p>We also want to produce a catalogue or a small book. The catalogue will feature a selection of the exhibited work and will be around 60 pages, including text by Jacob and text by the Photography Center of Thessaloniki. </p>
<p>An exhibition like this cost money and therefor we are asking for your help. We need money for printing the exhibition, for designing and printing the catalogue, for return flights for Jacob and accommodation. </p>

<b>Jacob Aue Sobol on the </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HOME </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">project :</b>
</h3>
<p>Home is a place of memories. It is where we have our roots. It is a place we keep returning to. If we want to learn more about ourselves and the world we live in, this is where we look – in our own backyard. The place where our personality is shaped and dreams were built.</p>
<h4>»Photograph your Home in a village you don’t know and where you have never been before. Show me what Home means to you«</h4>
<p>Two years ago I began my own Home project. </p>
<p>In my search to find a way to begin this project I found two pictures that inspired me. The first taken three years ago of my twin brother putting his hand on my grandmothers forehead as she was dying, and the other of my ex-girlfriends sister giving birth in Greenland back in 2002. For me the obvious existential character of these two images started off this project called Home. And so, since April 2011 I have been photographing family, friends, and acquaintances, but also encounters with strangers that I feel a connection with, and who invited me inside their apartments or houses. </p>
<p>In my workshop in Lafkos I gave the artist the same assignment or inspiration. Photograph your Home in a village you don’t know and where you have never been before. Show me what Home means to you. Not how it looks like but how it feels. The project turned out amazing.  </p>
<p>In the process the artists did not only use their camera to take pictures, but also as an instrument to create intimacy and closeness in a poetic, direct and unsentimental way. In spite of photography’s seemingly concrete form they exposed layers in people that are not immediately visible, but nonetheless shape who we are and give meaning to our lives. </p>
<p>This is their Home</p>

</div></div>","How it began
In June last year Photography Center of Thessaloniki arranged a workshop with the young Danish photographer Jacob Aue Sobol from Magnum Photos, in a small village called Lafkos near the town of Volos in central Greece. In this workshop attended 20 of Greece's most talented photographers. Jacob gave them the assignment HOME. Photograph your home in a city you don't know, not your physical home but your mental end emotional home. The photographers worked for five days with the topic of HOME, photographing the entire village, the people, the streets, the animals, each other, everything was photographed and a home took shape. 
Photography Center of Thessaloniki have since the workshop been in dialogue with Jacob and together with editor Sun Hee Engesltoft and producer Stinus Duch Andersen they have developed this project. Jacob Aue Sobol and Sun Hee Engesltoft will curate an exhibition of images from the workshop and up til now titled HOME. The photographers have worked on the theme since last summer and is now ready to show there work. The municipality of Thessaloniki has granted a fantastic exhibition place in Thessaloniki called Casa Bianca in January 2015 (12.01.2015 - 10/02 2015) with the official opening the 19.01.2015. 
Jacob Aue Sobol will be present at the opening and keep an open master class presentation and a portfolio review to everyone interested.
The participating greek photographers are:

The exhibition
The exhibition will feature 20 Greek photographers work on the theme HOME curated by Magnum photographer Jacob Aue Sobol and editor by Sun Hee Engesltoft. The photographers have worked on the theme HOME since the workshop last summer and has now each completed a series dealing with HOME. How is HOME in Greece right now? What is HOME to me? How does is look? How does HOME feel? Is HOME a place i want to stay? All these questions and many more have the artist asked themselves, and the exhibition is the result of their search for the meaning of HOME. 
Each photographer will show 1-15 pictures in different sizes printet on Hahnemühle 280gr fine art paper. The exhibition will be at a venue called Casa Bianca in the city of Thessaloniki in the central part of Greece. Thessaloniki is the second largest city in Greece after Athens with a population around 800.000. The venue Casa Bianca is the best exhibition place in Thessaloniki and used to host some of the most prominent exhibitions in Greece.  The Casa Bianca is a grand villa built in 1912 and is now funcitioning as  a municipal art gallery. The exhibition space is four rooms total around 70m2. 
We also want to produce a catalogue or a small book. The catalogue will feature a selection of the exhibited work and will be around 60 pages, including text by Jacob and text by the Photography Center of Thessaloniki. 
An exhibition like this cost money and therefor we are asking for your help. We need money for printing the exhibition, for designing and printing the catalogue, for return flights for Jacob and accommodation. 
We can only make this with your help
Our dream of making this exhibition can only come true with your help. Everything is set to go, the only thing missing is the funding. It is extremely difficult to raise funding for culture in Greece after the financial crisis and artists are suffering from this. It has up to now been impossible to raise money for this project, so now we hope for your help to see this exhibition come to life. 
The  project will also contribute to strengthening the bonds between Danish and Greek photography and bring Danish and Greek art closer together, learn from each other, creating and strengthening new communities and become a breeding ground for cultural exchange.

<p><strong>An art exhibit &amp; installation exploring the iconic photograph, A Great Day In Harlem through the lens of the A Great Day In Atlanta and little known legendary photographer, John Crooms as a tribute to Atlanta's art renaissance, and art communities across the globe.</strong></p>
<p>I am Kemi Bennings, visionary, producer, poet, curator and arts activist residing in Atlanta and I have been working in the Atlanta arts scene since 1995.  I am passionate about shining the spotlight on the works of independent artists, and unsung art heroes, as well as, preserving what will one day be recognized as our legacy.  I produce thought-provoking and entertaining event programming that moves, touches and inspires people. Ten years ago, I was given a vision.  It was a powerful project that allowed an opportunity to reflect and recognize the power of artists in Atlanta and art communities in general…here is my story… </p>
<p>In December 2002, I sat in the companyof artist trailblazers from the Washington, D.C. area; a hand full of artists, musicians, dream makers, movers, shakers and believers in faith. During the conversation, I noticed a framed picture of the iconic photograph “A Great Day In Harlem” mounted on the wall just behind the group.  As I sat and listened, and contributed to the dialogue, a common thread of Atlanta and Harlem began to niche itself out and weave its way into part of the African American legacy. Artists emerged like the days of the Harlem Renaissance, transcribing the “writing on the wall” into art and music and song. What I realized, whether we are conscious of it or not, is that in each moment, we are creating history; a unique story that will one day be recognized as a contribution to an era of our life’s importance. My thoughts then shifted to Atlanta.  It was in this moment that I envisioned a re-creation of this photograph as ""A Great Day In Atlanta"" based upon the vibrant Atlanta arts scene, and as a representation of what was happening in arts communities across the globe…</p>
<p>I've known John Crooms since the mid 90's, before the advent of the digital photography. I have always known him to be quiet, very humble and selfless when it came to photography. Most people amongst the scene can attest that we'd see John nearly EVERYWHERE; from all the premiere events to lesser advertised events or performances that were supposed to be on the ""hush"" or the ""hum bug"".  A man of few words, and an avid lover of arts and music, John was always in the know….  Has captured many ground-breaking artists, musicians, innovators, singers, etc...</p>
<p>Just so happened, I saw John at Moods Music (one of the last independent music stores on the planet) just before my leaving for Washington, D.C.  During our quick, but meaningful chat, I asked John when he was going to have an exhibit. I also impressed upon the magnitude and importance of his photographic contributions.  John silently shrugged, modestly sharing that he’d not ever had a solo art exhibit, that he'd get around to it ""one"" day…  </p>
<p>When I returned, it was as if two puzzle pieces had come together; that John would be the photographer befitting to capture A Great Day In Atlanta, and A Great Day In Atlanta being the precursor and the catalyst to honor the work of photographic historian, John Crooms.</p>
<p>Now ten years later, having captured the original 2003 AGDIA photograph, and this year’s 10-year anniversary re-creation, we have come back to finish what we started; to give John Crooms a proper solo art exhibit!</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Since the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta transformed into a performing arts mecca of the southern region and later in the early 2000’s the city was known internationally as the esteemed place for the entertainment industry to acquire talent. According to John Crooms: “In the late 80’s early 90’s Atlanta was really emerging and bubbling and it was a fresh new frontier that was happening. I felt I was a part of it and I wanted to be a part of it.” What we are seeing in today, is as a result of the innovative works of many of the creators, visionaries, pioneers, tastemakers and independant artists, many of whom are pictured in A Great Day In Atlanta. Through the lens of A Great Day In Atlanta, we experience a mirocosm of what is happening in art scenes around the globe. </p>
<p>Just for the record, and so you know the passion behind my work, my last curation was the acclaimed photographic art exhibit/installation entitled Ministers Of Sound, which opened February 2013, featuring the work of photographer, Annette Brown. A unique tribute to DJ's, through the inspiration of my late father, Ministers Of Sound is a parallel and contrast of DJ's to ministers; modern day, indigineous  and/or spiritual leaders.  In this installation, the space was transformed into a sanctuary, with spiritual aesthetics; stained glass windows, the pulpit (which was the DJ booth), ushers, etc.  This ongoing exhibit received local and national coverage.  Here are a couple of the articles.</p>

I am Kemi Bennings, visionary, producer, poet, curator and arts activist residing in Atlanta and I have been working in the Atlanta arts scene since 1995.  I am passionate about shining the spotlight on the works of independent artists, and unsung art heroes, as well as, preserving what will one day be recognized as our legacy.  I produce thought-provoking and entertaining event programming that moves, touches and inspires people. Ten years ago, I was given a vision.  It was a powerful project that allowed an opportunity to reflect and recognize the power of artists in Atlanta and art communities in general…here is my story… 
In December 2002, I sat in the companyof artist trailblazers from the Washington, D.C. area; a hand full of artists, musicians, dream makers, movers, shakers and believers in faith. During the conversation, I noticed a framed picture of the iconic photograph “A Great Day In Harlem” mounted on the wall just behind the group.  As I sat and listened, and contributed to the dialogue, a common thread of Atlanta and Harlem began to niche itself out and weave its way into part of the African American legacy. Artists emerged like the days of the Harlem Renaissance, transcribing the “writing on the wall” into art and music and song.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>Humanitarian photographer Emma O’Brien uses her images to
tell stories of people who are often forgotten. 
She has visited DRC twice in the last two years to meet with and
photograph men, women and children living in Eastern Congo to document their
stories with the aim of raising awareness and funds that will help to improve
their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Faces of Courage is a collection of portraits of ordinary
Congolese people living in extraordinary circumstances   This campaign is about attracting funding to
collate the images into a book, the proceeds from which will be used to fund
education and women’s empowerment programmes in the Goma and Bukavu regions of
the DRC.</p>
<p>It costs $75 to send a child to primary school for a year
in Eastern Congo, $95 to send a child to secondary school for a year and $195
to provide one woman with a sewing machine and the tools to start her own
business so she can provide for her family. 
The sales proceeds from 500 books will enable 50 women to start their
own businesses, 100 children to go to primary school and 80 children to go to
secondary school. That’s 230 lives being directly changed with the help of your
contribution, not to mention the impact these people will have on others around
them, this may seem like an insignificant number but the ripple effect of
something like this in a place where hopelessness reigns, is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Emma met with one lady whose family had disowned her
after she had a baby at 17 years old, she was part of a sewing workshop in
Bukavu to learn skills so she could start her own business in order to support
herself and her child.  The impact of
programmes like this is not only financial, it’s also a way of boosting self worth
for people who have had their lives shattered by circumstances beyond their
control.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>

Humanitarian photographer Emma O’Brien uses her images to
tell stories of people who are often forgotten. 
She has visited DRC twice in the last two years to meet with and
photograph men, women and children living in Eastern Congo to document their
stories with the aim of raising awareness and funds that will help to improve
their lives.

Faces of Courage is a collection of portraits of ordinary
Congolese people living in extraordinary circumstances   This campaign is about attracting funding to
collate the images into a book, the proceeds from which will be used to fund
education and women’s empowerment programmes in the Goma and Bukavu regions of
the DRC.
It costs $75 to send a child to primary school for a year
in Eastern Congo, $95 to send a child to secondary school for a year and $195
to provide one woman with a sewing machine and the tools to start her own
business so she can provide for her family. 
The sales proceeds from 500 books will enable 50 women to start their
own businesses, 100 children to go to primary school and 80 children to go to
secondary school. That’s 230 lives being directly changed with the help of your
contribution, not to mention the impact these people will have on others around
them, this may seem like an insignificant number but the ripple effect of
something like this in a place where hopelessness reigns, is immeasurable.
Emma met with one lady whose family had disowned her
after she had a baby at 17 years old, she was part of a sewing workshop in
Bukavu to learn skills so she could start her own business in order to support
herself and her child.  The impact of
programmes like this is not only financial, it’s also a way of boosting self worth
for people who have had their lives shattered by circumstances beyond their
control.

<p>This May, I am taking a group of 20 students on a cultural, ecological, and photographic tour of Costa Rica.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign builds on our work that has already been published and is available online for unrestricted use. The free-use photo database is open and accessible to anyone online, and our current images on SXC.hu have been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times!</p>
<p>The impact of your giving to this campaign can be measured by multiplying the usage of our current images by the estimated addition in photos that this funding will provide; if our current goal of $2,000 is met, we expect to publish a minimum of 1,000 free-use images from Latin America by August 2011.

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Ben Earwicker. In 2005, my wife Michelle and I began to publish our body of international photography from the more than 25 countries we have visited, using the free-use photography site Stock Exchange. 
As individuals, organizations, and businesses began to publish our work,
 we soon became the largest provider of free-use images on the site, and
 presently maintain one of the top 10 galleries on Stock Exchange. 
    

I am a Professor of Spanish and Latin American Studies, and use photography to communicate language and culture to my students and a larger online audience, through my research website, Garrison Photography, and our gallery on SXC.hu. 

This May, I am taking a group of 20 students on a cultural, ecological, and photographic tour of Costa Rica. The photography produced on that trip will become a part of my expanding Latin America photo database, but only if I can raise enough financial support to fund the editing and maintenance of my online database and free-use photo archives. 
The May trip to Costa Rica and all related expenses are already covered; this campaign will provide funding for the development of our free-use archives that are available to anyone online via our SXC gallery pages.



The Impact
This campaign builds on our work that has already been published and is available online for unrestricted use. The free-use photo database is open and accessible to anyone online, and our current images on SXC.hu have been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times!

<h3>About Exit Shows</h3>
<p>I am a graduating senior at UGA in the photography department. Each semester before graduation, students earning BFA degrees put on an ""exit show"" to showcase their final body of work. This spring semester, it's my turn!</p>
<p>Since this is my last chance to exhibit at UGA as a student, it's important for me to make a lasting impression. </p>
<p>With the right amount of funding, I will be able to exhibit my work in the most professional manner.</p>

<p>One of our goals is to travel north, beyond the artic circle et bring back footage from the more isolated communities of Fort McPherson et the village of Old Crow, Yukon’s only community with no road access.</p>

<h3>My Statement</h3>
<p>Hello, there! I am Barbara Jewell, a BFA Photography student at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. I specialize in dance portrait photography and performance photography. My artistic eclat, Lois Greenfield, is having her annual professional workshop in her New York studio. She is allowing a very select and small group of people to join her, use her photographic equipment (which includes her Hasselblad camera with a 22 megapixel-backing and professional lighting set up), and keep the images that they create. Here's a quote from her website:</p>
<p>""After demonstrating her process, the participants will photograph 
professional dancers at her studio in New York City using Broncolor 
strobes which stop action at 1/2000 of a second. Lois encourages the 
photographers to use her Hasselblad camera and the Leaf Valeo 
22-megapixel digital back...The 
group is limited to 6-8 people... The cost for the two days is $1350.""</p>
<p>After being in contact with her assistant for a month, I received a call from Greenfield herself explaining that she is holding me a place among professionals if I can make it to the workshop on from February 25th to the 28th. This is an opportunity like nothing I could have ever imagined. Being able to work with Greenfield would be an immense and invaluable step towards my professional career. And to get there, I need your help!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>This NYC workshop will be the foundation of my break into the professional world of dance photography. I will leave with professional insight into Greenfield's photography, make connections in my career field, and create a photographic portfolio epitomizing my goal as an artist. People are everything in the art world, and this workshop will supply me with an unparalleled contact book for an artist in my field.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have written and received an $800 grant from the Dean of my college towards this project, but that covers less than half of my fiscal investment in making this trip to NYC from Ohio University in Athens. The itemized list is as follows:</p>
<p>$1,350 - Program fee</p>
<p>$300 - airfare</p>
<p>$475 - hotel reservations for the 25th through the 28th</p>
<p>$50 - transportation around NYC; to and from airports and Greenfield's Studio<br/></p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>= $2,225 total (I have not included emergency funding or extraneous costs)</p>
<p>(- $800 from my Dean)</p>
<p>(-$500 supplied by me)</p>
<p>= about $925 not covered!<br/></p>
<p>I am trying to raise enough funding to cover the remainder of the program fee, which is due by the morning of the workshop on February 26th. <br/></p>
<p>If you think you can't contribute much, please keep in mind that I would appreciate an $8 dinner at least for one of the nights! <br/></p>
<p>For you, dear donor, I have perks for your gracious help in helping me to realize my dream! Since I am a photographer, I would be excited to exchange photographic services for any contribution to my trip; head-shots, performance documentation, dance portraiture, event photography, artwork documentation, basically anything you can think of, and I would be willing to work something out for your project. I also have access to studio space in Athens, OH but I could travel to document a specific event in the general area. Please reference my digital portfolio included in the links on this page for past projects.<br/></p>
<p>Also, after the project I will be making a documentation of the trip and project as a whole. For $25 donors, I will include your name in the ""Super Thanks"" credits! Check out the other perks for donations.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you are not in a position to support me financially, I would love for you to mention my NYC workshop trip to others. Please spread the word to every one you think would find this project interesting so perhaps they can help out. Notice the handy sharing toolbar on this page!<br/></p>

<p>I did some research and found some nearby places that would be appropriate for a studio and rent for a suitable fee. The rent for a year would cost me 5000€  (6100$).

Most important of all, this money would give me a <strong>huge head start</strong> in my studio-based photographic work. You can see my improvised home studio work so far on my website under Beauty and some under Concept. It is well worth noting that this shift in my career would have a <em>immense positive impact</em> on my <strong>health</strong> so I’m doing all I can to kick this plan into action.</p>

<h3><font size=""2"">First of all, sorry for my english.</font></h3>
<h3><font size=""2"">My Story, My Project.</font></h3>
<p><font size=""2"">I'm an Italian Multimedial artist, 37 years old. The heart of my artistic research, are the forms of power. Politics, consumption, religion, economy, media, cities, social behavior. I am interested in the relationship between all these elements that form a single body. The Power.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Slaughterhouse - in italian Mattatoio - fits perfectly in this research. Bringing to light the ""real price of meat"" through the use of photography, in an aberrant trip, across the processes of industrial meat production. A process that dehumanizes men and beasts. A production line that everyone, including me, guiltily forget, even while the meat cooked, bleeds into our mouths.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">The work, in short, is a trip through the slaughter houses that become a metaphor and truth of the dimension of power relationships.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">As if to imply that the man who makes of the industrialization, the purpose of the report with the beasts, is available to translate in the same practices, in the relationship with the powers. In a bloody game, which makes humanity executioner first, then victims.</font></p>
<p><font size=""2"">Moreover, the same relationship with the consumption of meat, always available, has disheartened our vision of coexistence of species. Now our look on the steak is the simple observation of a consumer good, that has just the cost of money. The same look of one who, knowing the size of his own power, looks at the nations, the masses, individuality.</font></p>

My Story, My Project.
I'm an Italian Multimedial artist, 37 years old. The heart of my artistic research, are the forms of power. Politics, consumption, religion, economy, media, cities, social behavior. I am interested in the relationship between all these elements that form a single body. The Power.
Slaughterhouse - in italian Mattatoio - fits perfectly in this research. Bringing to light the ""real price of meat"" through the use of photography, in an aberrant trip, across the processes of industrial meat production. A process that dehumanizes men and beasts. A production line that everyone, including me, guiltily forget, even while the meat cooked, bleeds into our mouths.

The work, in short, is a trip through the slaughter houses that become a metaphor and truth of the dimension of power relationships.

As if to imply that the man who makes of the industrialization, the purpose of the report with the beasts, is available to translate in the same practices, in the relationship with the powers. In a bloody game, which makes humanity executioner first, then victims.
Moreover, the same relationship with the consumption of meat, always available, has disheartened our vision of coexistence of species. Now our look on the steak is the simple observation of a consumer good, that has just the cost of money. The same look of one who, knowing the size of his own power, looks at the nations, the masses, individuality.



The Impact
I am convinced that this photographic work, making public the practices of slaughter, will lead to critical consumption of meat.For a different relationship with power.


What We Need & What You Get
This Found Rising is required to bear the costs of production of the first exhibition. Production costs consist of the release of50 images (150 x 100 cm), the recording studio for the music that I composed for the show (a suite for cello, piano and vocals recorded During the course of the killing of animals), the production of the exhibition catalog.The exhibition will be inaugurated in Cagliari, Italy, at the EXMA (a former slaughterhouse converted into an exhibition space)February 25, 2012 and ending March 30, 2012. From that day forward will be available ex for exhibitions around the world.

</p><p>With
your gracious assistance, I will be able to attend a nine-day photographic journey with
one of the best photographers in the world--Detroit's Monte Nagler (<a href=""http://www.montenagler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.montenagler.com</a>).  On May 3rd, a very small
group of photographers and Monte will pile in a van and leave Detroit, Michigan.  The first stop is in Cleveland, Ohio, then on to Niagara Falls and the Finger Lakes region in New York--with several other stops along the way.
 The group will return to Detroit on May 11th--exhausted but ecstatic. Nine days of nothing but
shooting and one-on-one instruction!<span>  <br/></span></p><h3>THE GOALS</h3><p>I have dabbled with photography since receiving my first
camera--a Polaroid Swinger Land Camera--around the age of 12.  My
first photos were of my family, friends and my cousin's cute boyfriend.  I have reached a point in my life where I want to quit ""dabbling""
and do something constructive with my photography.  <br/></p><p>My three immediate
goals are:<br/></p><ol>
<li>Improve
     my photographic skills through more instruction on techniques and composition.
      [Hence, my request for your help on attending this photo opportunity
     with Monte.] </li>
<li>Set
     up my own web page.  [I have just acquired
     <a href=""http://www.lucindahuffphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lucindahuffphotography.com</a> and will now coerce my son, Joshua, into
     helping set up my site.]</li>
<li>Host
     a one-woman photo show at the Wesley United Methodist Church in Fostoria,
     Ohio.  I have a few photographs ready for the show, but need more
     to have enough to display.</li>
</ol><p>Of course I have many other goals--but my end desire is to
be proud and confident in my photographic skills so I can sell my prints. I
have come a long way over the years since I first started shooting, but I am
not in the home stretch yet!</p>
<p>I have been lucky enough to previously attend one of Monte's
photographic trips.  Below are two waterfall photos--the first is a photo

</p><p>Please, call me Cindy. 
I am a 57 year old mom/grandma that is a marketing coordinator by day, and
a photographer during my evenings, weekends, and vacations.  I have always had a creative streak, either through arts and
crafts, sewing or drawing.  I inherited
this from my mom, and the drive to learn new things and keep at it until
conquered, from my dad.</p>
<p>Portrait photography and landscape photography have become
the main focus of my energies, but I like to shoot all subjects.  I would like to think that I have progressed
a lot since I started taking local adult education photography classes and
weekend seminars whenever possible.  But
I still need to improve my skills before turning this into something more than
a hobby.</p>
<p>To date my successes include entering one photo contest, and
winning second place in the open landscape category.  I have also shot a photo of the exterior of
Terra Community College that was used in their published materials.  For a work-related trade publication, I actually
shot the cover of one issue.  What a
thrill!</p>
<p>I love photography--whether it is shooting, or enjoying
others' work.  There is nothing like
being transported to another place or time, or feeling a shift in my mood, from
looking closely into a photograph.</p>
<h3><b>THE CONCLUSION</b></h3>
<p>Please check out the photographs on the <b>Gallery Tab</b> so you can be comfortable that I have <i>some</i>
talent and you wouldn't be wasting your pledge.  I hope you believe in me

<em><strong>I am Aurora</strong></em>; a creative and ever-learning 14 year-old photographer. I've always enjoyed taking photos, but a couple years ago, an awesome discovery of new friends and their art inspired me to become a true photographer...</h3>
<p>I have a few friends (fellow ETUSC campers) who are amazing photographers! After we all got home from camp the year we met, we stayed in touch over the computer. In the months to come, I watched them grow as artists with this thing they were doing...this '365' project.</p>
<p>What is the ""365 Project""?</p>
<p>A new photo taken each day for a year (and posted in Flickr as a means to share and grow)! I thought this was great because it keeps the photographer motivated to be working &amp; improving on their skills everyday. I learned <em>so</em> much from viewing their daily additions that I decided I wanted to try it for myself! When my aunt offered to sell me her old camera (a Nikon Coolpix L110), I took her up on it, handed over my $100 birthday money and got started!</p>
<p>In the past, my subject matter was mostly nature; lots of macro focused flowers, plants etc., and I explored abstract compostions with blurred focus - but for this new 365 project, my friends were doing mostly self-portraits. Though I hadn't been very into that before, I saw that it could in fact be very creative &amp; exciting! So, my photography became very much a blend of my old style &amp; this newly inspired self-portrait style.</p>

<h3>As I progressed, I started to have issues with the camera I had just used all my money to purchase:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There was no manual focus, so I couldn't experimint too much with specific focus, or the photo would end up looking plain bad instead of creative.</li>
<li>The photos were not sharp; this only improved a little bit when my mom got me a tripod.</li>

A tribute to Chris Schwarz
In June 2017, the Galicia Jewish Museum is planning to open a retrospective exhibition of the photography of Chris Schwarz, the founder and first director of the museum. This year marks the 10th anniversary of this distinguished British photographer’s premature death.



Before Kraków’s Kazimierz
Before devoting many years of his life to photographing traces of the Jewish past in south-eastern Poland, before permanently moving to Kraków to open the museum, for over two decades Chris worked as a photographer and photojournalist in Great Britain, the United States, Japan, Russia, Afghanistan and many other places.
Schwarz's work was always engaged, his lens often capturing those who needed help and attention the most, those who were often marginalized by society or those in power.


He documented social movements and the culture of capitalist society, Polish ""Solidarity,"" as well as Afghan refugees in the 1980s. His photographs of the march organized by the National Front, and the opposition’s counter-march, which tried to block them, in London’s Lewisham were featured on the front pages of newspapers throughout the United Kingdom. He photographed the homeless in Paris and London, nursing home retirees, citizens of London's district of Hammersmith and fans of the Millwall football club. He spent countless hours watching and photographing theatre plays, art performances and other cultural events. His photographs were regularly published in various newspapers and magazines, e.g. Time Out, The Independent, Guardian.
Much of his work for British NGO’s was made pro-bono. As a photographer, he felt the urge to make his work meaningful and his photographs a tool for helping others.



Galicia Jewish Museum
Chris Schwarz devoted the last years of his life to the Galicia Jewish Museum. His powerful photographs, accompanied by texts from Professor Jonathan Webber, became the core exhibition of the Galicia Jewish Museum, which he founded and opened in 2004.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For anyone who lives in Canada or in the northern states or other contries, we all know that when winter hits, it hits hard and very cold. And I have found that people don't like to go out into this weather and freeze their butts off doing photography. Winter can last half a year so that's a lot of shooting I and people that want me to shoot them are out of.</p>
<p>I'm Nicholas Fischer and I started to get into photography 5 years ago and have been doing it on and off again since then. In November of 2011 I was asked to do a photo shoot for someone, and after doing it sparked my passion for photography was again. In the last year I have been taking photography very seriously. I have done many shoots including my first wedding, a grad, maternity, family and some model shoots.</p>
<p>And then winter hit all shoots dried up. I had 6 shoots planned just before the first snow fall. And I love to shoot outdoors and the people I have shot with do as well but I need an alternate soulution. And instead of renting an expensive studio and having to booking specific time, I have a little space to accomadate my needs and make my own little studio. This studio will be used all year round and I will let other people use the studio for their photography needs.</p>

Preface by Ethan Russell. Introduction by Shannon Perich Photographic Curator for the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, and Preface by Neal Preston, Photographer.</p><p><strong>The Project: History Lived</strong></p><p><strong>As I've engaged in building this campaign, the reality of what it signifies has grown. This is something </strong><em><strong>we</strong></em><strong> do, something </strong><em><strong>we</strong></em><strong> build together. There's something special about that, and I commit to trying to keeping the communications open as we progress.</strong></p><p>This is my legacy project. I am a late in life father with a 15-year-old son, and in many ways this is for him.  It is my first and only fine art monograph. </p><p>The pace and order of the book is an expression of what my life experience has been as seen through my photographs. It is a journey through ordinary and extraordinary moments that is specific to my life, but in truth, it’s one of exploration, surprise, love, and even some history, that many of us witnessed and know its uniqueness. These things I want to share with you and connect through them to find a bit of shared experience for those who were there and to open that up for those who were not able to be there. The Introduction by Shannon Perich, Photographic Curator for the Smithsonian National Museum of American History speaks eloquently to this.</p><p>My goal is to raise sufficient funds to print 500 books, and to offer rewards and incentives to support that goal. This campaign is only committed to printing 500 books, something I've done to keep the initial funding request down.</p><p>Supporters of this campaign should note my insistence on top quality reproduction, even if that keeps the production costs up. It is important to focus on the distinctiveness of this book. It is a ""fine art monograph"" as opposed to simply a book, and that means (to me at least) that the quality of the reproduction plays an essential role. It will be top tier. The book weighs over 5.5 lbs (the Deluxe Edition weighs 8 lbs). The monograph's dimensions are 14 x 10.25 inches (28 inches wide when open) and it will be 244 pages. Because I am sensitive to supporters about the costs, please know the $95 price (at level 2) for just the book and a card is based just on the cost of printing and estimated shipping.</p><p>I hope this commitment to quality brings satisfaction to the people who have always liked my work – to be able to see it finally presented simply and beautifully printed. </p><p>I have worked hard to have the rewards and incentives seem appropriate for the level of donation. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.</p><p><strong>About the Journey</strong></p><p>I was an accidental photographer. I was lucky. Of all my creative work it has been my photography which has brought the most joy to the most people.  While I have labored intensively on books where the <em>story</em> was the focus, I never really let my photographic work simply stand on its own. Now, paging through the prototype of the book, I find I am touched by the photographs gathered together without distraction, flowing page after page with simply a caption (although sometimes a lengthy one) as if the photographs were finally allowed to speak for themselves. </p><p>This project has been iterating for many years. With the support and feedback of professional colleagues and kind friends, the layout of the book, the design and the essays have come together to bring us to the final stages of printing and publication.  I hope you will participate in making this book a reality. </p><p>It is with these goals that I  enter into this Kickstarter project. </p><p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p><p>I began my photographic career without formal training.  Asked to explain how I had any capacity to work as a photographer at all, I recalled a mental image of myself when I was around 11 standing in an orchard at my parents' ranch. I was a hunter - mostly for blue jays – using a small, 22-caliber single-shot rifle.    It was a solitary experience. I would wait quietly in the heat. There were only, maybe, ten trees, and they didn’t bear much fruit. But I would hide as best as I could, not moving a muscle, until a blue jay showed up. Then advancing slowly so I would not scare the bird, I would bring the gun to my shoulder, sight it, and carefully squeeze the trigger. Years later I identified this set of skills — an ability to scan a scene, to remain barely visible, to move quickly, focus, and then press a release steadily— as core skills for the kind of photographer I became, and at which I earned my living for years, a job I was never trained to do.</p><p>I got on a plane in 1967 from San Francisco to London in the height of British invasion fully expecting that when I emerged it would be into a mecca of music that would dwarf what was happening in San Francisco. This is not what I found. It was there, but it was barely visible in day to day London.  But with ""more luck than any human being should be allowed to have"" (<em>The Daily Beast</em>) I was introduced to Mick Jagger, then John Lennon, then The Rolling Stones and then The Beatles.  I took it from there.</p><div data-caption=""Ethan Russell Photographs The Beatles, The Rolling Stones &amp; The Who"" data-id=""24056219""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Ethan Russell Photographs The Beatles, The Rolling Stones &amp; The Who"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1553812427/h059o1j0fovjrgcvk8up.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Ethan Russell Photographs The Beatles, The Rolling Stones &amp; The Who</figcaption></figure></div><div data-caption=""Spreads from the book: The Who, The Beatles &amp; The Rolling Stones"" data-id=""24056236""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Spreads from the book: The Who, The Beatles &amp; The Rolling Stones"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1553812428/gtmb3p4irha9wkbnzin1.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>Spreads from the book: The Who, The Beatles &amp; The Rolling Stones</figcaption></figure></div><p>When I think today about how my work might bring value, I believe this is the most significant: I didn’t change what was in front of the camera, and what was in front of the camera was monumental.  I photographed what was true. I was in extraordinary places, and I shot photographs that let people just be there. The moment is not about the photographer, the moment is about what you share.</p><p>I believe that my intuition about the music and the artists, for whom I felt enormous respect and admiration, comes through.  There is also an intimacy in much of the work that results from my invisibility, which grew from the considerable time I spent with them and the trust that came from that.  My photographs reveal, in a phrase I sometimes use, real moments with extraordinary people.  Those are what I would like to share with you.</p><p><strong>BOOK SPECS</strong></p><p>There will be two versions of the book the <strong>Regular Edition </strong>(expected price: $95) and the <strong>Deluxe Limited Edition </strong>(expected price: $450.) All copies given to backers of this Kickstarter project will be from the First Edition printing of the book, which I will oversee.</p><p>Note: there will be an <strong>additional publication</strong> starting at level 4: a separately bound  (and shipped) approximately 45 page book <strong>""The Inside Story."" </strong>This will provide even more background on the images in the book, where they were taken, the circumstances, technical information (camera, lens, film, lighting rig, etc.)  This is not expected to be available  with the commercial version of the book.</p><p><em><strong>Please also note: Those interested should take advantage of this Special First Printing of the Deluxe Edition because it’s likely that after the Kickstarter campaign is over the Deluxe Edition of the book may not be available, or, if available, may be more expensive.</strong></em></p><p><strong>NEW PERK</strong></p><p>Just added as a thank-you to all who have <em>already</em> pledged and for all who pledge going forward <strong>at any level that includes a book </strong>(Regular or Deluxe) a signed and personalized printed triptych of me shooting The Beatles, The Rolling Stones &amp; The Who, That is a calling card of my work as a photographer and it occurred to me that it would be nice for those helping make this campaign happen to have a personal thank-you.

Preface by Ethan Russell. Introduction by Shannon Perich Photographic Curator for the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, and Preface by Neal Preston, Photographer.The Project: History LivedAs I've engaged in building this campaign, the reality of what it signifies has grown. This is something we do, something we build together. There's something special about that, and I commit to trying to keeping the communications open as we progress.This is my legacy project. I am a late in life father with a 15-year-old son, and in many ways this is for him.  It is my first and only fine art monograph. The pace and order of the book is an expression of what my life experience has been as seen through my photographs. It is a journey through ordinary and extraordinary moments that is specific to my life, but in truth, it’s one of exploration, surprise, love, and even some history, that many of us witnessed and know its uniqueness. These things I want to share with you and connect through them to find a bit of shared experience for those who were there and to open that up for those who were not able to be there. The Introduction by Shannon Perich, Photographic Curator for the Smithsonian National Museum of American History speaks eloquently to this.My goal is to raise sufficient funds to print 500 books, and to offer rewards and incentives to support that goal. This campaign is only committed to printing 500 books, something I've done to keep the initial funding request down.Supporters of this campaign should note my insistence on top quality reproduction, even if that keeps the production costs up. It is important to focus on the distinctiveness of this book. It is a ""fine art monograph"" as opposed to simply a book, and that means (to me at least) that the quality of the reproduction plays an essential role. It will be top tier. The book weighs over 5.5 lbs (the Deluxe Edition weighs 8 lbs). The monograph's dimensions are 14 x 10.25 inches (28 inches wide when open) and it will be 244 pages. Because I am sensitive to supporters about the costs, please know the $95 price (at level 2) for just the book and a card is based just on the cost of printing and estimated shipping.I hope this commitment to quality brings satisfaction to the people who have always liked my work – to be able to see it finally presented simply and beautifully printed. I have worked hard to have the rewards and incentives seem appropriate for the level of donation. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.About the JourneyI was an accidental photographer. I was lucky. Of all my creative work it has been my photography which has brought the most joy to the most people.  While I have labored intensively on books where the story was the focus, I never really let my photographic work simply stand on its own. Now, paging through the prototype of the book, I find I am touched by the photographs gathered together without distraction, flowing page after page with simply a caption (although sometimes a lengthy one) as if the photographs were finally allowed to speak for themselves. This project has been iterating for many years. With the support and feedback of professional colleagues and kind friends, the layout of the book, the design and the essays have come together to bring us to the final stages of printing and publication.  I hope you will participate in making this book a reality. It is with these goals that I  enter into this Kickstarter project. BACKGROUNDI began my photographic career without formal training.  Asked to explain how I had any capacity to work as a photographer at all, I recalled a mental image of myself when I was around 11 standing in an orchard at my parents' ranch. I was a hunter - mostly for blue jays – using a small, 22-caliber single-shot rifle.    It was a solitary experience. I would wait quietly in the heat. There were only, maybe, ten trees, and they didn’t bear much fruit. But I would hide as best as I could, not moving a muscle, until a blue jay showed up. Then advancing slowly so I would not scare the bird, I would bring the gun to my shoulder, sight it, and carefully squeeze the trigger. Years later I identified this set of skills — an ability to scan a scene, to remain barely visible, to move quickly, focus, and then press a release steadily— as core skills for the kind of photographer I became, and at which I earned my living for years, a job I was never trained to do.I got on a plane in 1967 from San Francisco to London in the height of British invasion fully expecting that when I emerged it would be into a mecca of music that would dwarf what was happening in San Francisco. This is not what I found. It was there, but it was barely visible in day to day London.  But with ""more luck than any human being should be allowed to have"" (The Daily Beast) I was introduced to Mick Jagger, then John Lennon, then The Rolling Stones and then The Beatles.  I took it from there.Ethan Russell Photographs The Beatles, The Rolling Stones & The WhoSpreads from the book: The Who, The Beatles & The Rolling StonesWhen I think today about how my work might bring value, I believe this is the most significant: I didn’t change what was in front of the camera, and what was in front of the camera was monumental.  I photographed what was true. I was in extraordinary places, and I shot photographs that let people just be there. The moment is not about the photographer, the moment is about what you share.I believe that my intuition about the music and the artists, for whom I felt enormous respect and admiration, comes through.  There is also an intimacy in much of the work that results from my invisibility, which grew from the considerable time I spent with them and the trust that came from that.  My photographs reveal, in a phrase I sometimes use, real moments with extraordinary people.  Those are what I would like to share with you.BOOK SPECSThere will be two versions of the book the Regular Edition (expected price: $95) and the Deluxe Limited Edition (expected price: $450.) All copies given to backers of this Kickstarter project will be from the First Edition printing of the book, which I will oversee.Note: there will be an additional publication starting at level 4: a separately bound  (and shipped) approximately 45 page book ""The Inside Story."" This will provide even more background on the images in the book, where they were taken, the circumstances, technical information (camera, lens, film, lighting rig, etc.)  This is not expected to be available  with the commercial version of the book.Please also note: Those interested should take advantage of this Special First Printing of the Deluxe Edition because it’s likely that after the Kickstarter campaign is over the Deluxe Edition of the book may not be available, or, if available, may be more expensive.NEW PERKJust added as a thank-you to all who have already pledged and for all who pledge going forward at any level that includes a book (Regular or Deluxe) a signed and personalized printed triptych of me shooting The Beatles, The Rolling Stones & The Who, That is a calling card of my work as a photographer and it occurred to me that it would be nice for those helping make this campaign happen to have a personal thank-you.

Much of this is good and unavoidable, some of it is destructive and short-sighted, all of it will change Rangoon forever.
Relics of Rangoon is a magnificent tribute to this jewel of a city, past, present and future. The product of the loving eyes, dedication, and prolonged exertions of a team led by Philip Heijmans, Relics of Rangoon could not have been better nor relevantly timed. Beautifully photographed, handsomely produced, and insightfully written, Relics of Rangoon captures a passing moment of remembrance, deliverance and great hope. This book is a monument to be treasured.""
Sean Turnell, Associate Professor, Department of Economics at Macquarie University and Economic Advisor to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party.
“This beautiful book will be an eye-opener. Rangoon grew into a great trading city, on the banks of the Irrawaddy river and in sight of the golden Shwedagon, in the 19th and early 20thCs. As the city now emerges from a period of hibernation, the quality and extent of its colonial architecture – much of created by fellow Scots – becomes more and more a revelation. The excellence of Philip Heijman’s photographs and his concise but thoroughly researched accounts will appeal to tourists and scholars alike. Rangoon was, for me, ‘love at first sight’ and I will treasure Philip’s book.”

With no prior training or experience, within 4 weeks I had taken shots that <b>won</b> me the <b>Scotland Magazine Photo Challenge 2015</b> and gained <b>Highly Commended</b> in the first <b>Scottish Landscape Photographer of the Year</b> competition.</p>
<p>I've since gone on to gain other awards including <b>Commended</b> in the prestigious <b>UK Landscape Photographer of the Year 2015 </b>competition.</p>
<p>A graduate of Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen, I've spent the past 20 years running a successful web design business. I eventually sold up (in a deal that went flat) due to ill health and stress. 
<span>I shortly thereafter took up photography as a hobby,
but also as therapy in my battle with anxiety. 20 years of daily
stress had taken its toll.</span></p>
<p><span>I quickly found out
that it is only when out in the landscape taking photographs (often camping out
at the top of mountains for days) that I can escape the everyday problems. The
freedom and joy I feel when watching the light move across the landscape along
with our wonderful unpredictable Scottish weather is something I wish to get across in
the finished art works.</span></p>
<p>I discovered within me a talent I didn't know existed and a vocation that I dearly want to continue with. I'll shortly be hosting my first <b>solo exhibition</b> as a landscape photographer at the <b>Veneer Gallery</b>, Glasgow in February 2016.</p>
<p><b>I need your help to allow me to keep producing work</b>.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>After nearly 60,000 shots and 30,000 miles travelled in just a year, my poor camera equipment is at deaths door. The mixture of shooting seascapes in storms, or standing up mountains in the pouring rain means my gear (as we say in Scotland), is ""gubbed""!</p>
<p>In order to keep producing work up to the exhibition which will hopefully kick start my career as a photographer, I need to replace some of my equipment, especially my Canon 6D camera, along with damaged filters.</p>
<p><b>No camera, means no new photography</b>. Unfortunately, losing my business left me with no other income and 30,000 miles of travel over the past year has severely dwindled my funds. The cost of putting on the exhibition (funded entirely by myself) will run in to the thousands.</p>
<p>Every pound raised will go towards new equipment and in return, every contributor will get;</p>

</div></div>","About Me Hi, my name is Neil Barr and 12 months ago I picked up my first DSLR camera. With no prior training or experience, within 4 weeks I had taken shots that won me the Scotland Magazine Photo Challenge 2015 and gained Highly Commended in the first Scottish Landscape Photographer of the Year competition.
I've since gone on to gain other awards including Commended in the prestigious UK Landscape Photographer of the Year 2015 competition.
A graduate of Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen, I've spent the past 20 years running a successful web design business. I eventually sold up (in a deal that went flat) due to ill health and stress. 
I shortly thereafter took up photography as a hobby,
but also as therapy in my battle with anxiety. 20 years of daily
stress had taken its toll.
I quickly found out
that it is only when out in the landscape taking photographs (often camping out
at the top of mountains for days) that I can escape the everyday problems. The
freedom and joy I feel when watching the light move across the landscape along
with our wonderful unpredictable Scottish weather is something I wish to get across in
the finished art works.
I discovered within me a talent I didn't know existed and a vocation that I dearly want to continue with. I'll shortly be hosting my first solo exhibition as a landscape photographer at the Veneer Gallery, Glasgow in February 2016.
I need your help to allow me to keep producing work.   What I Need & What You Get After nearly 60,000 shots and 30,000 miles travelled in just a year, my poor camera equipment is at deaths door. The mixture of shooting seascapes in storms, or standing up mountains in the pouring rain means my gear (as we say in Scotland), is ""gubbed""!
In order to keep producing work up to the exhibition which will hopefully kick start my career as a photographer, I need to replace some of my equipment, especially my Canon 6D camera, along with damaged filters.
No camera, means no new photography. Unfortunately, losing my business left me with no other income and 30,000 miles of travel over the past year has severely dwindled my funds. The cost of putting on the exhibition (funded entirely by myself) will run in to the thousands.
Every pound raised will go towards new equipment and in return, every contributor will get;


For £20 (+ shipping) - signed A4 signed print from my portfolio & invite to exhibition preview.
For £40 (+ shipping) - signed A3 signed print from my portfolio & invite to exhibition preview.

For £60 (+ shipping) - signed A2 signed print from my portfolio & invite to exhibition preview.

For £80 - half days 1-2-1 tuition for one person, within 50 mile radius of Glasgow & invite to exhibition preview.
For £120 - full days 1-2-1 tuition for one person, within 50 mile radius of Glasgow & invite to exhibition preview.

All prints will be hand signed and printed on Epson Premium Luster Photo Paper with Ultra Chrome K3 Inks and delivered in time for Christmas. Contributors can select from any photograph in my portfolio on www.neilbarr.co.uk. Further details on tuition (with standard prices) on my site - www.neilbarr.co.uk/121-photography-tuition


Please have a look at the gallery attached to this campaign or my work on www.neilbarr.co.uk to see what I have produced so far. I'll email every contributor personally after the campaign to arrange selection and printing of your prints or to arrange the 1-2-1 tuition.


The Impact
 

I am currently in discussions
with other galleries across Scotland about follow up exhibitions. A successful
run at the Veneer Gallery will boost my chances of more exhibitions. 

This
exhibition will be a major step in my dream for a long sustainable career in
landscape photography and ultimately a route to recovery. It will allow me to
fund new work, reach an audience I couldn’t otherwise reach and for the first
time, show the quality of my work in the manner it was always meant to be seen.    Challenges Landscape photography is often seen as the 'poor man' of the art world. It can be challenging to produce and make your mark in it when there are so many doing it these days.
I hope my work speaks for itself. I am improving every day, but only with your help can I have any hope of continuing down this road. Success will mean even better work in the future and hopefully the funds to keep producing it.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot assist with a contribution, please have a look at my portfolio and spread the word, or even buy a small print or two. Please use the share tools to let your friends and family know about my campaign.

Now we are preparing to complete our studies and present our BFA Photography Exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>But we need your help!</strong> For us to have a successful event, we must find a proper venue and transform it into a professional gallery. Any amount you can donate will help us work towards our goal of hosting a stellar show and would be greatly appreciated. Please, support us in our efforts to put on a fantastic show. </p>

<p>...renting a space for the show, refreshments, buying lights, paint, tools for hanging, frames, printing costs, and advertising are just a few supplies needed for a great event. After securing supplies we must go about arranging, hanging, and setting up for the exhibition.

<div>
<br/>In July 2012, I removed the tumor, and my vision has continued to deteriorate. I did many medical tests; Italian health service provides free medical care but I had to pay a lot of expenses to avoid long waits (currently I spent about 2000 €).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was very worried and scared, monocular loss of vision is a symptom of multiple sclerosis. So I did other diagnostic neurological and ophthalmological test, my doctors have diagnosed <strong>optic neuritis</strong>.<br/><br/>

<div>My view is a disaster, I'm a programmer and you can imagine the hard work that I do every day to work. I loved to read so much, but now after a few rows I have severe nausea. Fortunately, the left eye (although it has some symptom of optic neuritis) works quite well.</div>
<p>There is no cure for this disease, I can only take vitamins and alpha lipoic acid and hope that in one year or two I will be able to see better.

<h3>Perks for You!</h3>
<p>I'm seriously so stoked on the perks of this project because it's one thing to see your work live it's life on the internet, but it's just another level of satisfaction when you get to see your work printed out on a wall in all of it's glory. I can't wait to thank all of y'all for your support with a physical piece of my work to enjoy IRL. </p>

About me:<div>I have been working as a documentary photographer for nearly thirty years.  Over the past decade I have photographed life in the townships of Langa, Khayelitsha, Philippi and Mitchell's Plain outside of Cape Town, South Africa.  My work there began during a Guggenheim Fellowship year for my exploration of the culture of amateur boxing. During my trip,  I met people living in Langa and Khayelitsha and began photographing the Luvuyo Boxing Club in Khayelitsha. I felt uncomfortable as yet another white person with a camera,  photographing people with less resources and access to power.  Subsequently, I cut my trip short, unsure of the work I was doing and who would actually benefit from it.  Upon my return to the States,  I looked at the pictures I had made and decided to go back to learn more, to further explore post-apartheid life in  black communities.  After over a dozen trips and more than a thousand rolls of film, I began to believe that the pictures mattered-they were not about people as victims, or about poverty, or any of those things one imagines life in black South African townships to be. </div>
<div>
<p>Outside the cities frequented by tourists and business travelers, in vibrant townships, I found beauty and strength and all the contradictions of being human in the people I photographed; a preacher testifying to his rapt congregation;  a couple's loving embrace at day’s end; the proud regard of my friend Sindi in her traditional Xhosa dress; the moving funeral of a young Sotho man; the poetry and grace of a girl dancing on a warm Sunday afternoon;  and the striking face of “Dream Girl,” a young woman studying to be a traditional healer, a “sangoma.""</p>

<p><b>Who are we?</b>
</p>
<p>Sputnik
Photos is an international collective founded in 2006 by documentary
photographers from Central and Eastern Europe. We are united by a desire to
observe and describe what surrounds us, as well as by our common experience of
living in post-transformation countries.</p>
<p>Our
achievements to date include important international awards, such as World
Press Photo and Pictures of the Year International. Together we have organized
several exhibitions around the world and published 8 photobooks. Our projects
have been featured at photography festivals, in galleries and magazines
worldwide.</p>

<p><b>About our project.  </b></p>
<p>We would like to invite you to support our artistic project in <b>post-soviet
countries of Central Asia. </b>Twenty-five years after the fall of the USSR
five Sputnik Photos photographers are setting out on a journey to five former
soviet republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
 </p>
<p>For a number of years, we have been documenting changes taking
place in post-communist countries, particularly in the former republics of the
Soviet Union, always referring to our own individual experience of the
transformation period. Recently, we have focused on Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia,
Armenia and Georgia. In the face of an increasing political tension in the
region, photography documenting everyday life, and the changes and myths of the
countries still falling under Russian influence, becomes even more relevant.</p>

<p>At the current stage, we are planning further trips to the
former Soviet empire, focusing on Central Asia, and we hope you will support
our efforts. </p>
<p>We are interested in what is happening in the countries that
used to be part of the Soviet Union, and still remain under Russian influence,
because their history is also our history and it concerns us directly. We
are immersing ourselves in this complex and multi-faceted world. We are
uncovering the nations’ nostalgia for the empire, their drive to democracy,
traces of former propaganda, poverty, but also the emergence of the new and
hope for a better future. We are aware that our project will give neither a
diagnosis nor simple and straightforward answers to the questions relevant for
the region. Yet, we want to make discoveries and show them to others. We
believe that 25 years after the change is a perfect time to sum up the efforts
our nations have made to date.</p>

Sputnik
Photos is an international collective founded in 2006 by documentary
photographers from Central and Eastern Europe. We are united by a desire to
observe and describe what surrounds us, as well as by our common experience of
living in post-transformation countries.
Our
achievements to date include important international awards, such as World
Press Photo and Pictures of the Year International. Together we have organized
several exhibitions around the world and published 8 photobooks. Our projects
have been featured at photography festivals, in galleries and magazines
worldwide.









About our project.  
We would like to invite you to support our artistic project in post-soviet
countries of Central Asia. Twenty-five years after the fall of the USSR
five Sputnik Photos photographers are setting out on a journey to five former
soviet republics: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
 
For a number of years, we have been documenting changes taking
place in post-communist countries, particularly in the former republics of the
Soviet Union, always referring to our own individual experience of the
transformation period. Recently, we have focused on Belarus, Ukraine, Moldavia,
Armenia and Georgia. In the face of an increasing political tension in the
region, photography documenting everyday life, and the changes and myths of the
countries still falling under Russian influence, becomes even more relevant.



Rafal Milach - from the series “Black sea of concrete.”


At the current stage, we are planning further trips to the
former Soviet empire, focusing on Central Asia, and we hope you will support
our efforts. 
We are interested in what is happening in the countries that
used to be part of the Soviet Union, and still remain under Russian influence,
because their history is also our history and it concerns us directly. We
are immersing ourselves in this complex and multi-faceted world. We are
uncovering the nations’ nostalgia for the empire, their drive to democracy,
traces of former propaganda, poverty, but also the emergence of the new and
hope for a better future. We are aware that our project will give neither a
diagnosis nor simple and straightforward answers to the questions relevant for
the region. Yet, we want to make discoveries and show them to others. We
believe that 25 years after the change is a perfect time to sum up the efforts
our nations have made to date.
Your help can make it happen!





Agnieszka Rayss - from the series ""I reminesce and cry for life.""

The funds raised will enable each of us to go on a single trip
to one of the countries we focus on:
Kazakhstan: Agnieszka Rayss
Uzbekistan: Michał Łuczak 
Turkmenistan: Rafał Milach
Tajikistan: Adam Pańczuk
Kyrgyzstan: Jan Brykczyński



Adam Panczuk - from the sersies ""I_AM_IN_VOGUE@BELARUS.BY"".


The amount will cover
return flights, films, their developing and scanning, accommodation and guides.
In other words, a minimum that allows 5 people to make 5 independent trips and
create 5 extraordinary stories.


Jan Brykczynski - from the series ""Primary forest"".




The project will be rounded off in 2016 by a mobile
exhibition and a photobook for audiences across the globe. It will show all the
15 countries that used to be part of the USSR.

  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for collectors and photography lovers. 
 This book became a legend years before it came into being. Seriously.Katowice Railway Station constructed in 1972 was a high-standard 
building. Raw concrete constructions were at the time a symbol of 
modernity and prosperity of Polish Peopleos Republic. Only a decade 
later neglected building began to fall into ruins.  SOLD OUT!

A ruin in the city center of the biggest, postindustrial coal-mining 
district in Poland started to live its own life. On one hand it was 
still a place were people got on and off the trains but on the other it 
became an area of uncommon ""passengers"" who didn't have any tickets and 
never got on any train. They where the ones who created there some kind 
of a parallel world which existed on the sidelines of normal life.
Katowice Railway Station was destroyed at the beginning of  2011, it was
 the last significant example of brutalist architecture in Poland.More about the projecthere",36.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! If you don't know me, my name is Victor. I'm an artist working primarily in photography. I've been attending Brown University for the last 4 years, studying Visual Art. At Brown, I discovered the importance of printing my images, in small and large sizes. Printing and arranging images on a wall has taught me how to make new meaning out of my work. Now that I'm close to graduating, I'm losing access to the tools I need to keep up my newfound art practice. I've never been good at asking for help, but I'm asking for any and all contributions for this campaign. Please help me continue developing my art practice post-grad by contributing to funds for a large-format photo printer. As a first-generation, immigrant college student, graduating from Brown is a tremendous achievement for me. I aim to continue achieving the best things I can within my art practice, but I need your help to get started!</p>

<div>And thank you for looking at our funding page! Let us tell you some more about our very exciting project:</div>
<h3>The Media Medicum Photo Exhibition</h3> <p></p>
<p>Media Medicum is a group exhibition which will be set up by 5 Edinburgh based female photographers going under the name Panopticon. All 5 are currently enrolled at Napier University in Edinburgh - 3rd year Photography BA(Hons). This is our end of the year degree project and we really need all help we can get to make it successful. We appreciate all help - both funding contributions and/or people sharing our page on social media to make it grow.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why an Art project in Medicine?</h3>
<p>The 19th century was a historically momentous period in the development of various medicinal theories and practices. By investigating and researching these elements we aim to bring light to some lesser known theories and practices that are the basis of modern medicine.</p>
<p>Each member intends to explore a particular theory or practice.
By creating a photographic response to our chosen subject matter, every work
will re-frame the history of the past into a modern context. The project will bring to life an era that made modern medicine what it is today! </p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brandi Watson. After I began having kids, I started dreaming about having a nice camera of my own to take professional looking photos at home. Over the past year or so I've realized how many people in my community aren't able to get family pictures taken because of the cost or drive involved. I started thinking about how I would like to bless others in our community with low cost but professional family portraits. I have been asked to take family, senior and maternity portraits for family and friends recently but have always had to borrow others equipment. I would love to have a nice camera, tripod and photo editing software on hand to be more available to others when the opportunity arises. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funding for a Canon Rebel T3, a tripod, a bigger memory card and Photoshop Lightroom editing software. If I exceed my $ goal, all extra funds will be used for additional equipment. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help me to be able to provide quality photos for families in our community who may not be able to do so otherwise. </p>
<p>Please feel free to share this campaign with others. Thank you so much for your time!</p></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

                  On The Way Down










Just before last Christmas we decided to move to Southern California with our animal family;  2 cats and a German Shepherd Dog. We packed up our apartment and our photography/digital art studio and made the journey. That first night in Southern California impacted our lives permanently.  Our fully loaded moving truck was stolen from a residential neighborhood.  EVERYTHING we worked all our lives for was taken from us. The insurance refused to pay claiming that theft is not covered in the policy.

Aside from the loss of our furniture, all of our clothes, household items, electronics, bikes, and the usual personal
belongings everyone has, we also lost 20 years of photography work and equipment; our Mac computers, laptop, tablets,
hard-drives and all of our camera and lighting equipment. Twenty years of work
stolen.  A lifetime of photos, slides and digital images, art books, art
collection, and a collection of classical music CD’s. There were all the photos
with so many memories and the precious items like a wooden camera from Mikel’s
grandfather and a watch from Iyesha’s mother, things from the people we love
who are no longer with us… the list goes on. Just imagine that you wake up one morning and no longer have even a spoon or a towel, everything you know and cherish has suddenly disappeared.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I'll do</h3>
<p>I shooted dancers for the last 10 years. My passion for dancers, for their exceptional bodies, the grace, the energy... that's what I want to put in my first photo book. </p>
<p>All the images will be in full colour, printed on silk finished paper. The book will be in A4 size, paperback binded. </p>
<p>I always shoot dancers with maximum passion... I'll put this passion on each page. </p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Scatto fotografie di danza da 10 anni, La mia passione per i danzatori, per i loro corpi meravigliosi, la grazia, l'energia... questo è ciò che voglio portare nel mio primo libro fotografico.</p>
<p>Il libro sarà in formato A4, rilegato in brossura, stampato su carta patinata. Conterrà immagini in bianco e nero ed a colori.</p>
<p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
<p>It was only a couple of years after I started shooting as freelance photographer that I opened my first studio in Verona, Italy. At age 30 I wasn't too young and I wanted to become a pro soon. And that's exactly what I did. I'm a self-taught photographer.</p>
<p>Now, working out of an even bigger studio in my country house, I photograph a wide range of subjects - from performing arts to still life and architecture. My favourite genres, however, are dance photography and portraiture. Dance photography is the first kind of photography I did professionally and that's why these are the photographs I love the most.. Beginning with dance school shows and recitals, I then progressed to photographing professional dancers and dance companies.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Sono un fotografo freelance, autodidatta. Ho parto il mio studio qualche anno fa a Verona. Ora ho realizzato uno studio più grande nella mia casa in campagna. Pur fotografando vari soggetti, la mia specializzazione è la fotografia di danza e di ritratto. Ho iniziato fin da subito a fotografare la danza, prima con le scuole di danza dellam ia città, poi, via via, collaborando con danzatori professionisti e compegnai edi danza.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I'll need $ 2.500 to print at least 200 A4 paperback books. That's my goal!</p>
<p>But obvioulsy I hope to print more books. Raising 500 copies I could print a better quality book at the same price!</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Punto a raccogliere $ 2.500,00 per stampare almeno 200 libri. Ovviamente spero in risutati più importanti. Riuscendo a ""pre-vendere"" almeno 500 libri potrei, manenendo lo stesso prezzo, aumnetarne la qualità</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
<p>I'm shooting new pics, working with amazing dancers. Classical ballerinas, hip hop dancers, breakdancers, Flamenco dancers and more. Everybody works for free... we only want to take our passion to dance lovers and to fine art photography lovers.</p>

What I'll do
I shooted dancers for the last 10 years. My passion for dancers, for their exceptional bodies, the grace, the energy... that's what I want to put in my first photo book. 
All the images will be in full colour, printed on silk finished paper. The book will be in A4 size, paperback binded. 
I always shoot dancers with maximum passion... I'll put this passion on each page. 
------------------------------------------------------
Scatto fotografie di danza da 10 anni, La mia passione per i danzatori, per i loro corpi meravigliosi, la grazia, l'energia... questo è ciò che voglio portare nel mio primo libro fotografico.
Il libro sarà in formato A4, rilegato in brossura, stampato su carta patinata. Conterrà immagini in bianco e nero ed a colori.
Who I am
It was only a couple of years after I started shooting as freelance photographer that I opened my first studio in Verona, Italy. At age 30 I wasn't too young and I wanted to become a pro soon. And that's exactly what I did. I'm a self-taught photographer.
Now, working out of an even bigger studio in my country house, I photograph a wide range of subjects - from performing arts to still life and architecture. My favourite genres, however, are dance photography and portraiture. Dance photography is the first kind of photography I did professionally and that's why these are the photographs I love the most.. Beginning with dance school shows and recitals, I then progressed to photographing professional dancers and dance companies.
------------------------------------------------------
Sono un fotografo freelance, autodidatta. Ho parto il mio studio qualche anno fa a Verona. Ora ho realizzato uno studio più grande nella mia casa in campagna. Pur fotografando vari soggetti, la mia specializzazione è la fotografia di danza e di ritratto. Ho iniziato fin da subito a fotografare la danza, prima con le scuole di danza dellam ia città, poi, via via, collaborando con danzatori professionisti e compegnai edi danza.
 


What I Need 
I'll need $ 2.500 to print at least 200 A4 paperback books. That's my goal!
But obvioulsy I hope to print more books. Raising 500 copies I could print a better quality book at the same price!
------------------------------------------------------
Punto a raccogliere $ 2.500,00 per stampare almeno 200 libri. Ovviamente spero in risutati più importanti. Riuscendo a ""pre-vendere"" almeno 500 libri potrei, manenendo lo stesso prezzo, aumnetarne la qualità
 


What I'm Doing
I'm shooting new pics, working with amazing dancers. Classical ballerinas, hip hop dancers, breakdancers, Flamenco dancers and more. Everybody works for free... we only want to take our passion to dance lovers and to fine art photography lovers.
------------------------------------------------------
Sto scattando nuove foto, lavorando con fantastici danzatori. Ballerini classici, di hip hop, breakdancers, danzatrici di Flamenco ed altro. Tutti lavorano gratis, non si tratta di un progetto con fini di lucro, vogliamo solo portare la nostra passione ad altri amanti della danza e della fotografia.

I'd love it if you'd pass this along your Facebook, Twitter, etc etc to any and all people who may be interested, or even just people that you know. Even your Grandma may love it!

After the task was complete I said my goodbyes and put my camera bag over my shoulders, although the camera bag was zipped up the camera only compartment was not, and crashing went my X-T1 and 56 1.2. </p>
<p>The first feeling I felt was embarrassment, I was in a beginners photography class and everyone knew I had the most experience, except when I dropped my camera I felt as if my credibility had fallen, it was the worst thing ever. A round of cringe worthy sounds blurted out of the student's mouth, I reassured them nothing was wrong and that it would be okay, I strictly remember saying ""Don't worry it's a Fuji"" but deep down inside I was as worried and as scared as they all appeared to be.</p>
<p>I went to the hall to test my camera and lens and to no avail, it went crashing face down, lens first, then bouncing to the cameras rear end, this fall was high, shoulder up I'd say... </p>
<p>I was crushed, tears almost, I've quit everything from my job to my friends to pursue my career as a wedding photography. A successful Reddit campaign has resulted in me booking a few weddings later this year, and now I no longer have the equipment to do so, nor do I have the funds to purchase another body, rather it be less expensive or not.</p>
<p>The truth is, I'm unemployed, at least I am now because yesterday I was self-employed. It's only been 24 hours and I don't know what to do, or think or how to even feel. I've been placed in rough situations before, but I've always had photography to get my mind off of things. Except now, I don't have it, and my dreams seem further away than ever.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Perks</h3> <p>I don't have much to offer, I'm a struggling artist. The perk section is the thriving idea behind crowdfunding. I assume if you're local then I can offer free photo shoots, or a meet up, but for the masses I will gladly make a blog post thanking each and everyone of you individually. I run a photography website/blog <a href=""http://www.rivalsvs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RIVALSvs</a>. Check it out, your name and contribution will get it's own page and your kindness will not be overlooked.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Obviously the goal isn't guaranteed, purchasing the equipment that was broken would cost a total of $2300 or so brand new, with $1800 being a goal to purchase the items used. I'm hoping you all can understand what I'm going through and understand that I'm not asking for $2300 from each of you, but $3-5 from each individual could go a long way and can turn this goal from fruition to reality. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't spare the $3-5 no problem, looking at the campaign and sharing it is an effort that won't go over looked. Everyone doesn't have the means to sharing income, but word of mouth is an avenue we can all participate in. An artist in each of us!</p>
<p><b>*** With you all's support and the faith I have in this campaign I was able to purchase my X-T1 with a little added cash I made from selling unnecessary gear.

<p>If you had to pick your one favorite object, what would it be? What would that say about you? What object would join you for posterity? Would it be a favorite food, a book, an instrument, something from your trade or a guilty pleasure?</p>
<p>Well, I'll be going around Europe to find out exactly that. I will capture with my Graflex the personal, sweet, sad and odd portraits that will arise from the combination of a person and the object they chose.</p>
<h3>Where the Funds Will Go</h3>
<p>Film. The amount of money I'll raise will be directly related to how far this trip will go. The more film I have, the more I can extend the project, both in time and space.</p>

</div></div>","If you had to pick your one favorite object, what would it be? What would that say about you? What object would join you for posterity? Would it be a favorite food, a book, an instrument, something from your trade or a guilty pleasure?
Well, I'll be going around Europe to find out exactly that. I will capture with my Graflex the personal, sweet, sad and odd portraits that will arise from the combination of a person and the object they chose.
Where the Funds Will Go
Film. The amount of money I'll raise will be directly related to how far this trip will go. The more film I have, the more I can extend the project, both in time and space.


The Gear
The camera is an early 1900s Auto Graflex. It's an American press camera that was built by Folmer & Schwing. It is a large format camera, taking 4x5"" pictures.

The lens is a large format uncoated Bausch & Lomb Zeiss Tessar model 1C.

<h3>Did you know that nearly half a billion people around the world depend on coral reefs for their survival? Or that over 30% of reefs and other vital coastal habitats have been degraded or destroyed worldwide?</h3>
<h3>Help us protect one of the world’s most threatened reefs and send an ocean conservation message to the world!</h3>
<p>Expedition: Danajon Bank is an international photo exhibition, book, and advocacy campaign to protect a rare and threatened double-barrier coral reef in the Philippines and educate the world about marine conservation, one of the most important issues today. It's a collaboration between the world’s top nature photographers and marine scientists.</p>
<p>Little-known to the outside world, the Danajon Bank is one of only six double-barrier reefs in the world, and one of the most important marine ecosystems in the entire Pacific Ocean. Species found all over the Pacific are thought to have first evolved here. Unfortunately, Danajon Bank faces many threats, including overfishing and destructive fishing practices (such as blast fishing with explosives), as well as overdevelopment, and climate change. The reef is home to at least 200 threatened animals, such as the elusive Tiger-tail seahorse. </p>
<p>Our project aims to capture Danajon Bank in all its fragile beauty and share the images with the world to raise awareness about the threats facing this important ecosystem and many thousands of fragile marine ecosystems around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Following a two-week expedition in spring 2013, we will produce a beautiful hardcover photo book and launch a series of large-scale photo exhibitions at aquariums in London, Chicago, Hong Kong, Manila, and beyond. </strong></p>
<p>The result will be a powerful photographic legacy that will help conservationists to push for increased marine protections in the Philippines and around the world.</p>

<h3><strong><br/>ABOUT DANAJON BANK</strong></h3>
<p>One of only six double-barrier reef formations in the world, Danajon Bank is thought to be an evolutionary point of origin for many marine animals found all over the Pacific Ocean. According to the IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species, it is home to 196 threatened species and ecosystems, including Anacropora spinos, a highly endangered coral, and the Tiger-tail seahorse (Hippocampus comes), which is listed as vulnerable.</p>
<p>The Danajon Bank is also home to hundreds of thousands of people, who depend on it for food and livelihoods. Unfortunately, overfishing, pollution, and development threaten both the future of the ecoyststem and the fishing communities who depend on it for survival.</p>
<p>The Danajon Bank encompasses many of our oceans’ most important and threatened marine habitats, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs. Its biodiversity, and the threats it faces from human activity, make it a powerful example of the beauty of the world’s coastal marine ecosystems and the threats they face in the 21st century.</p>

<p>For women, aging brings with it an inner grace and beauty that is more than skin deep. From birth to old age, women transition through many physical, psychological, and emotional phases that are recorded on their faces.</p>
<p>Never before has a book so vividly projected the images of women in all stages of life in a way that reveals who they really are as women.  <em>Feminine Transitions: A Photographic Celebration of Natural Beauty</em> is a refreshing and inspiring, full-color book of photography. Its pages present a series of portraits that reveal the elegance and subtly honest beauty of female faces between the ages of 7 weeks and 105 years.</p>
<p>Author and photographer Alyscia Cunningham has truly unmasked the natural beauty of aging. “In a world filled with ‘Photoshopped’ images of women who are heavily made up, this book is a breath of fresh air,” says Trista Hendren, author of The Girl God and writer at the blog Elephant Journal.</p>
<p>The process of photographing the portraits for the book turned out to be a transition for Alyscia. “I simply wanted to put together a body of work that fosters a woman’s love for herself and encourages women to believe in their own beauty, despite the signs of aging,” says Alyscia.  “But as I looked through my lens, I couldn’t see the women. All I could see was their makeup.  Their masks.”</p>
<p>Alyscia then made the decision that all of her subjects remove their makeup for their portraits. That was when the book project really took shape. The importance of a woman’s “natural” beauty took center stage.</p>
<p><em>Feminine Transitions</em> unmasks women and exquisitely demonstrates that young is beautiful, old is beautiful, and natural is beautiful.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I am so proud and excited to produce my first photography book that was originally scheduled for release in <strong>March 2013, Women's History Month, but has been extended</strong>. I am also coordinating traveling exhibitions showcasing the images from my book. With your help and contributions, I hope to be able to raise the money for my shows and book production. The funds will be used for printing the first 500 copies of my book, rental space, framing, invitations, marketing, installation and all of the other things that go along with launching major solo exhibitions. </p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal on this round, I will purchase 100 copies using Blurb to publish. However, Blurb's prices are far higher than going to a traditional printer. Nonetheless, have a few copies in hand will be beneficial as people would rather see a product in hand.  From there, I will continue to collect the funds until I reach my goal by holding future funding campaigns. I've also submitted applications via my local arts organizations for grants and currently awaiting the status. </p>
<p>For your generous contribution, you will receive signed and personalized copies of Feminine Transitions along with recognition in the book’s marketing materials, which will be distributed to hundreds of media outlets. Higher-level sponsors can take advantage of tickets to the Feminine Transitions book launch party, prominent logo placements and even a full photography session from Alyscia Cunningham Photography.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Our Story
For women, aging brings with it an inner grace and beauty that is more than skin deep. From birth to old age, women transition through many physical, psychological, and emotional phases that are recorded on their faces.
Never before has a book so vividly projected the images of women in all stages of life in a way that reveals who they really are as women.  Feminine Transitions: A Photographic Celebration of Natural Beauty is a refreshing and inspiring, full-color book of photography. Its pages present a series of portraits that reveal the elegance and subtly honest beauty of female faces between the ages of 7 weeks and 105 years.
Author and photographer Alyscia Cunningham has truly unmasked the natural beauty of aging. “In a world filled with ‘Photoshopped’ images of women who are heavily made up, this book is a breath of fresh air,” says Trista Hendren, author of The Girl God and writer at the blog Elephant Journal.
The process of photographing the portraits for the book turned out to be a transition for Alyscia. “I simply wanted to put together a body of work that fosters a woman’s love for herself and encourages women to believe in their own beauty, despite the signs of aging,” says Alyscia.  “But as I looked through my lens, I couldn’t see the women. All I could see was their makeup.  Their masks.”
Alyscia then made the decision that all of her subjects remove their makeup for their portraits. That was when the book project really took shape. The importance of a woman’s “natural” beauty took center stage.
Feminine Transitions unmasks women and exquisitely demonstrates that young is beautiful, old is beautiful, and natural is beautiful.
Read Alyscia's bio. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
I am so proud and excited to produce my first photography book that was originally scheduled for release in March 2013, Women's History Month, but has been extended. I am also coordinating traveling exhibitions showcasing the images from my book. With your help and contributions, I hope to be able to raise the money for my shows and book production. The funds will be used for printing the first 500 copies of my book, rental space, framing, invitations, marketing, installation and all of the other things that go along with launching major solo exhibitions. 
If I do not reach my entire goal on this round, I will purchase 100 copies using Blurb to publish. However, Blurb's prices are far higher than going to a traditional printer. Nonetheless, have a few copies in hand will be beneficial as people would rather see a product in hand.  From there, I will continue to collect the funds until I reach my goal by holding future funding campaigns. I've also submitted applications via my local arts organizations for grants and currently awaiting the status. 
For your generous contribution, you will receive signed and personalized copies of Feminine Transitions along with recognition in the book’s marketing materials, which will be distributed to hundreds of media outlets. Higher-level sponsors can take advantage of tickets to the Feminine Transitions book launch party, prominent logo placements and even a full photography session from Alyscia Cunningham Photography.
In order to spread this important message of self-confidence to communities around the country, this project relies on support from individuals and organizations like yours. Please help make an impact and be part of this global movement by supporting Feminine Transitions at one of the perk levels.

Norris as a creative photographic artist in the greatest town on the planet, New York City.</p><h3>What is Persona?</h3><p>Persona is, at its most basic, a prospective intimate (read: small) photography studio in NYC.  A soon-to-be-open room in my apartment will be converted into a full-time studio space and serve as its location.  Simple.</p><h3>What makes Persona Studio different?</h3><p>In short, the photographer.</p><p>You often see the human body, especially in the realm of contemporary photography, portrayed as and mistaken for a reduction of who one is, inviting a kind of valuation that I never found fair or accurate.  It's because of this the human form hadn't been a favorite subject for me to photograph.</p><p>That all changed when I was given the opportunity to take a number of portraits in a setting I controlled.  To my surprise, my differing interpretation of people and the human body actually translated to the end result of what appeared in the frame.  What I saw was imagery that, for me, expanded thoughts on what it was to be human.  That the reduction of people is not something inherent to photography as a medium, but maybe the result of the perspective of those taking the pictures.</p><p>You see, to me our bodies and how we present them are best characterized as a performing art piece; an ever-evolving physical culmination of an individual's creative decisions coupled with the biological decisions of our ancestors along with the dents and scrapes we may have picked up along the way.  A person's creative mind brushing paint upon a given physical canvas.</p><p>And that might alter a viewer's perspective.  A body or picture of one isn't ""who you are"", but merely a visual statement given by its owner.  And yet by lessening what we think a portrait can accurately yield we gain something far greater: a collection of diverse creations of the human mind made physical.  The more diversity in these visual statements from individual to individual we see, the more wonder, perhaps even hope and vision we may elicit for humanity's potential.</p><p>Like I mentioned before, this interpretation resulted in shots that seem to me a little different from the rest.  Rather than photos whose primary mission is showcasing physical aesthetics or mechanics, they were shots that attempted to illustrate the physical manifestation of each individual's creative mind.  And that's something I thought was worth pursuing and sharing.</p><p>That's why I want to begin this project.  To open up how people view their own bodies and to change how they're perceived by others, and perhaps have some of those others join in and so on and so forth.  To unlearn notions of physical beauty and in its stead offer the far great breadth and depth to be found in the realm that is human creativity.</p><p>Anyway, that's the aim.</p><h3>I'm Interested!  What Now?</h3><p>Great!  If you're in or plan to visit the NYC area, just select the ""featured perk"", a full studio session with me, and you're now in line to be part of The Persona Project!  If you won't be in the NYC area, consider the ""photographer to your door"" option where I bring myself and my equipment to you, to shoot either in a studio set up in your home, or wherever else you might want to be photographed!</p><p>The first step of any photo session at Persona will start with an interview so I might begin to know you and you get to know me a bit.  This ""interview"" will start off as a casual chat and can be done anywhere any time or day before the shoot, but I believe it's an important part of the process whether we've never met or we've known each other for a long time.  If you like, you may consider it a bonus addition built into your perk: a pleasant conversation over a beverage on me!</p><p>At the end of the chat, we'll discuss and schedule a time convenient for you, and the photo shoot will be carried out in one session, up to 3-hours on site at the new Persona Studio.</p><p>A comfortable and convivial experience is important and will be fostered, as I know being in front of the camera presents plenty of challenges even in the best of circumstances.  Another big thing I've learned in the course of studio photography is that modeling is not easy!  But the people I've worked with have all left with positive feelings about the shoot and are eager to shoot again soon.  You can be rest assured I'm going to keep doing what I do to keep that record intact.</p><p>After the session is done, you get to go home as I get to work picking the best of the images captured and processing them.  After about a week, the results along with the rest of the raw shots not picked will be put on a portable usb flash drive for you to keep, print, share as you wish!</p><h3>What if I'm Looking for Something Specific, Like Headshots or a Product Shoot?</h3><p>Actor in need of headshots?  Or perhaps you're looking for corporate headshots?  Or you're a business owner and are seeking out high-quality product shots.  In any of these cases, we'll knock them out and they'll be fantastic, whether you'd like the shots to be purely functional or you'd like them to really stand out, we can make it happen.  And if you like, any additional time afterwards can be used to shoot more thoughtful pieces as explained above.</p><p>The same goes for family portraits, or any specifically utilitarian studio portraiture you'd like done.  Exceptions would be things like boudoir or any heavily stylized photography, as photography along those lines would be speaking in a creative voice that isn't really mine.</p><p>If you aren't sure whether your specific requests can be done or you have any questions at all, just click the ""ask a question"" link above and I'll be more than happy to answer any queries you might have!</p><h3>What Exactly Will the Start Up Contributions Go Towards?</h3><p>The relatively low number to Persona's startup target are in part due to the fact I already own almost all of the lighting and photo gear necessary for this endeavor.  So, the $1,200 accounts for ~$250 worth of backdrop rig and the rest to

<br/><strong>Qui suis-je</strong>
</h3><p>Simon Emond est un photographe autodidacte né à Hébertville le 6 avril 1992. Depuis quatre ans, il consacre sa vie professionnelle à ce médium. Il a obtenu une nomination en 2014 au Gala des lauréats de la Chambre de Commerce Lac-Saint-Jean Est dans la catégorie choix du public - entreprise de services et  il a gagné le prix de la Fondation de l'Entrepreneurship du Québec en 2015.  </p><p>Emond ancre sa production artistique dans son milieu, notamment à travers la production de calendriers permettant de soutenir financièrement la Maison des jeunes d’Hébertville et celle d’Hébertville-Station.

Qui suis-je
Simon Emond est un photographe autodidacte né à Hébertville le 6 avril 1992. Depuis quatre ans, il consacre sa vie professionnelle à ce médium. Il a obtenu une nomination en 2014 au Gala des lauréats de la Chambre de Commerce Lac-Saint-Jean Est dans la catégorie choix du public - entreprise de services et  il a gagné le prix de la Fondation de l'Entrepreneurship du Québec en 2015.  Emond ancre sa production artistique dans son milieu, notamment à travers la production de calendriers permettant de soutenir financièrement la Maison des jeunes d’Hébertville et celle d’Hébertville-Station. La ville d’Alma a également fait appel à lui pour son calendrier soulignant son 150e anniversaire.Il a lancé un projet d’hommage photographique dont les portraits grands formats sont exposés à l’entrée du dépanneur le Campagnard, plaque tournante du village.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Jesse Hurler, and I am a 22 year old student at William Paterson University currently pursuing my Masters Degree. Although I am pursuing a career which is separate from the creative world, I have recently fallen in love with photography as a hobby, an art form which has opened up a whole new world in which I can express myself creatively. It is something that I am fairly new to, but completely inspired by.</p>
<p>I have recently been given the incredible opportunity to have some of my photos displayed in a photo gallery as a solo exhibition for a two month installment. This is a great honor which is not only a high personal achievement for myself, but will help me to expand my audience of viewers and open new doors to creating and sharing my photos with the world.</p>

</p>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>The reason I have created this page and why I am reaching out to you is because I am in great need of funding in order to make this gallery show a reality and a success! </p>
<p>The funds raised here will go directly to the different costs involved in preparing for and setting up the photos for the gallery space. These preparations include: </p>
<ul>
<li>The purchase of individual matted frames for the photos<br/>
</li>
<li>The costs of printing high-quality/high resolution copies of the photos<br/>
</li>
<li>Transportation to and from the gallery for setup <br/>
</li>
<li>The gallery's fee for allowing me to hold my exhibition in their space</li>
</ul>
<p>My fundraising goal is set at $600, an amount which I believe will be sufficient to cover all costs. Even if my goal is not reached, the money will still go towards the gallery exhibition preparation costs.</p>

Our goal is to enable artist photographers to express what's inside them. We see a lens as a supporting tool for your photographic vision - a paintbrush to bring images from your imagination to life. We made the Lydith 30/f.3.5 available for almost all modern mounts.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502357466/esoezif4ceveuyg7ap5x.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The new Lydith fulfils all of this criteria. However, in our prototype test shootings, photographers came back and said: Wow, this little art lens outperformed my expectations so much that we had trouble finding words to express how special it performed.<br/><br/>Sharpness? Contrast? Yes, the Lydith is maybe the sharpest and most contrasty lens in our historic art lens portfolio and of course, as a Meyer-Optik lens, it can produce extraordinary bokeh. But in combination with its ability to capture light - it grows to its full potential.</p><p>And we have another treat for you: The Lydith has an extremely low minimum focusing distance of 0.16m. So you can get very close to your object, while still displaying a good portion of the surroundings. If you have a lens at a focal length, you might have things in mind you want to shoot with it. But due to the Lydith's performance, you will try out setups you wouldn't have shot with any other lens at this range.

We want to give the growing community of Meyer Optik lovers another chance to get the wonderful Lydith 30 lens to a price that will never come up again. Moreover we are more than happy to introduce this lens to the Indiegogo community and to bring new magic into the images of photographers that never heard about us before. But now, let us tell you something about the Lydith 30 f/3.5 - a wonderful art lens.In this project, we want to introduce you to a very special lens - a lens that has the potential to add new dimensions to your photography.By design, its focal length of 30mm gives your pictures an interesting perspective. But moreover, its unique ability to display simply stunning colors, catch exceptional lights and capture glimpses of a magical moment will offer you undreamt of artistic options.Its a lens to capture magic in your images like no other.    Meyer-Optik knows that many people merely evaluate lenses for their optical specifications. Our goal is to enable artist photographers to express what's inside them. We see a lens as a supporting tool for your photographic vision - a paintbrush to bring images from your imagination to life. We made the Lydith 30/f.3.5 available for almost all modern mounts.The new Lydith fulfils all of this criteria. However, in our prototype test shootings, photographers came back and said: Wow, this little art lens outperformed my expectations so much that we had trouble finding words to express how special it performed.Sharpness? Contrast? Yes, the Lydith is maybe the sharpest and most contrasty lens in our historic art lens portfolio and of course, as a Meyer-Optik lens, it can produce extraordinary bokeh. But in combination with its ability to capture light - it grows to its full potential.And we have another treat for you: The Lydith has an extremely low minimum focusing distance of 0.16m. So you can get very close to your object, while still displaying a good portion of the surroundings. If you have a lens at a focal length, you might have things in mind you want to shoot with it. But due to the Lydith's performance, you will try out setups you wouldn't have shot with any other lens at this range. Come on, join us on the journey where the Lydith takes us.  the Lydith is even perfect to shoot close-upsWhat is a magic moment for you? How do you preserve it? There are situations which you simply want to make last forever. Probably, the more special they are, the more fleeting they are or vice versa. It is maybe the most difficult task for a photographer to capture more than a reflection of reality but the underlying spirit of the moment. The Lydith is able to add this third dimension to your pictures.  The Lydith has always been famous for its amazing ability to catch colors. Colors are the central element to create aesthetic results in your images. The Lydith is able catch colors like no other historic art lens can. But convince yourself.  The Lydith's character for close-ups is just stunning. Due to its minimal focusing distance of only 0.16m, the Lydith is perfect for intimate close-ups giving your shots a personal and emotional touch. Due to its compact size, it won't intimidate your subjects - a huge advantage when shooting children or anybody who is not a professional model. As a result, you will create natural, fascinating pictures so close that you can look in your model's heart and soul.   To portray people in their natural environments is perhaps one of the most interesting jobs in photography. Those pictures tell an entire story, including attitudes, moods and the spirit of a person. The Lydith is the perfect lens if you have a story to tell. It can capture little details, conveying emotion and adding an artistic touch to your pictures while maintaining a natural flavour.  Those who already follow us on social media know that we have an affinity for extraordinay nature shots. So, of course, the Lydith masters this class on an equal level. Oh boy, and how it does! Even everyday scenes become magic. Look at these scenes and enjoy!  Painting with light is the very meaning of photography. The Lydith can create a very soft bokeh, similar to a watercolor picture. In backlit situations the bokeh appears like it was painted with an art brush, while the focussed object is sharp. Therefore, the Lydith is the perfect lens to play with bokeh and to design your pictures from fore to background.   The Lydith 30mm f3.5 is built using the same platform that we used for our Trioplan 50 and 35mm lenses. Thus we take advantage of some economies of scale and can offer this breathtaking lens to our backers at a very special price. Following our design principles, this lens is compact and light and weights just above 220g.The historical Lydith and its constructionWe have set extremely tight standards in our lens design that can only be met by using the best Schott and Ohara glasses and having them produced under the toughest quality measures. We will be using a special coating in the front and back lens that will make the lenses extremely durable and tough for a lifelong enjoyment.You certainly can imagine that running such a project is only possible thanks to the help of many helping hands.Our special thanks goes to our prototype test photographers. Their feedback of you is essential to create these wonderful art lenses.Let us introduce a few who have contributed pictures to this campaign, ladies first:Tamara SkudiesTamara has assisted us with test shoots from the very beginning. Always hands-on, she develops tons of creative ideas from scratch. Tamara is a nature photography enthusiast, well known for her ability to see colours in her own, wonderful artsy way.Raffaele HorstmannRaffaele has worked for us as a consultant photographer since the very beginning. He assists us with his direct feedback as a photographer and is one of the first to get his hands on Meyer-Optik lenses.Firat BagduFirat is a Cologne based portrait photographer, who has worked with us for almost a year now. You can distinguish Firats shoots by his incomparable ability to convey emotion in pictures. Benedikt ErnstBenedikt, is one of the pillars when it comes to testshootings.As a professional fashion photographer, he has a weakness for historic lenses.

<b>Cigarettes (Not for Me): </b>While I do not smoke, nor advise people to smoke, I will purchase a few packs to take to Flint.

<p><b> </b>Just over halfway through the campaign, and I think I am starting to gain a little traction. I was getting discouraged at first, wanting to give up, but I realized that I will have plenty of time to sulk once the campaign is over, and I can still make this happen. </p>
<p>I just wanted to point out that my goal is not something that is set it stone, but rather a cushion that I feel will help me really get this thing off the ground should I reach my goal. Even if I only make 25-50% of it, it will be a good start and I will still do everything I can to get this thing off the ground. You guys are just helping me get closer and making it more accessible to someone like me. </p>
<p>Since I have started, I have been slowly adding to a fund that will go directly towards this project and will only be used to get these books printed. However, I do not plan to add it to this campaign because there are too many 3rd parties that want their cut from whatever comes through this campaign. Indiegogo takes 10% and I think Paypal takes 2%, so instead of giving them even more, everything I have saved will go in the pile once the campaign is complete and I receive the funds that I have raised. So far I have $500 from my own personal stash saved up, and I have been adding to it whenever I have a little extra cash. So just so you know I am not relying 100% on you guys. </p>
<p>I am extremely grateful for all of my supporters who are helping me out and want to see me succeed here, your kindness has brought tears to my eyes, and not just from those that have contributed, but those that have said kind words about me and my work that continues to blow me away every day. You are all amazing and keep me pushing to succeed instead of wanting to give up like I feel sometimes. Even if I don't make my goal, or even come close, just the words alone have lifted me up so much. I don't even know what to say anymore...THANK YOU ALL!! Let's see what happens from here...</p>

<h3>Salt n Meat</h3> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hey everyone! thank you for checking out my campaign! Before we begin, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and why I am here. For those who do not know me, My name is Adam and I am a music photographer, raised in the heart of the Rocky Mountains in beautiful Colorado. I attended Colorado Mountain College for Professional Photography, and graduated in the spring of 2014 with an Associates of Applied Science. I am currently finishing up my second AAS in Graphic Design.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Music is MY LIFE. It is the only thing that truly matters to me more than anything. In close second is photography, and third is travelling, I have found a way to combine all three by photographing live concerts and musicians on stage as well as off. I have travelled thousands of miles all over the US chasing my favorite bands and photographing them as well as my travels. There is no greater feeling than putting miles and miles behind you while the stereo is blasting and the wind is in your hair; well, except for seeing your favorite band live!!</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">One of the greatest experiences of my life was the first ever Farmageddon Records Music Festival in July of 2012. I never met a group of people so friendly and welcoming, people who I had never met before in my life suddenly became family. And to make matters worse, it was four days FILLED with intense, powerful, and inspiring music. Definitely a life changing/eye opening experience!! I had been to tons of music festivals before, but nothing even touched this one. I was hooked, and I wanted to share my experience with others through my photography. </span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After the festival, I compiled a book of my photographs from my experience for a Self Publishing class. It originally started out as a personal project, and after showing it to my friends and classmates, it turned into something much bigger. After a lot of struggle, and with the help of a very good friend, I eventually got my first book printed so that others could enjoy my work for themselves. I sold a few copies but it did not take off like I thought it would. My original plan was to take all the money made from the first book to fund the second book, and then take the money from the second book to fund the third, and so on....But by the time I got the 2012 book finally printed, FF13 had already came and went, and we were now gearing up for 2014. I was able to sell some of my books here and there, but it was not enough to cover the cost of the next production.</span></p>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>So this is what brings me here. My idea is to raise all the funds to get BOTH 2013 and 2014 Farm books printed at the same time, that way I don't have to struggle two more times, I can just do it once and get it over with! Obviously this is a very expensive project, it will take a lot of hard work and patience. But I love seeing people enjoy my work, and I love sharing these memories with the people that helped create them, so I am dedicated to this project 100%. I'm hoping that this campaign will help me get this project off the ground. Because I have had so many people express interest in these books, I am fairly </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">confident I will not have a problem reaching my goal.</span>

</div></div>","UPDATE  - 11/2/2014
 Just over halfway through the campaign, and I think I am starting to gain a little traction. I was getting discouraged at first, wanting to give up, but I realized that I will have plenty of time to sulk once the campaign is over, and I can still make this happen. 
I just wanted to point out that my goal is not something that is set it stone, but rather a cushion that I feel will help me really get this thing off the ground should I reach my goal. Even if I only make 25-50% of it, it will be a good start and I will still do everything I can to get this thing off the ground. You guys are just helping me get closer and making it more accessible to someone like me. 
Since I have started, I have been slowly adding to a fund that will go directly towards this project and will only be used to get these books printed. However, I do not plan to add it to this campaign because there are too many 3rd parties that want their cut from whatever comes through this campaign. Indiegogo takes 10% and I think Paypal takes 2%, so instead of giving them even more, everything I have saved will go in the pile once the campaign is complete and I receive the funds that I have raised. So far I have $500 from my own personal stash saved up, and I have been adding to it whenever I have a little extra cash. So just so you know I am not relying 100% on you guys. 
I am extremely grateful for all of my supporters who are helping me out and want to see me succeed here, your kindness has brought tears to my eyes, and not just from those that have contributed, but those that have said kind words about me and my work that continues to blow me away every day. You are all amazing and keep me pushing to succeed instead of wanting to give up like I feel sometimes. Even if I don't make my goal, or even come close, just the words alone have lifted me up so much. I don't even know what to say anymore...THANK YOU ALL!! Let's see what happens from here...


Salt n Meat Hey everyone! thank you for checking out my campaign! Before we begin, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself and why I am here. For those who do not know me, My name is Adam and I am a music photographer, raised in the heart of the Rocky Mountains in beautiful Colorado. I attended Colorado Mountain College for Professional Photography, and graduated in the spring of 2014 with an Associates of Applied Science. I am currently finishing up my second AAS in Graphic Design.
Music is MY LIFE. It is the only thing that truly matters to me more than anything. In close second is photography, and third is travelling, I have found a way to combine all three by photographing live concerts and musicians on stage as well as off. I have travelled thousands of miles all over the US chasing my favorite bands and photographing them as well as my travels. There is no greater feeling than putting miles and miles behind you while the stereo is blasting and the wind is in your hair; well, except for seeing your favorite band live!!One of the greatest experiences of my life was the first ever Farmageddon Records Music Festival in July of 2012. I never met a group of people so friendly and welcoming, people who I had never met before in my life suddenly became family. And to make matters worse, it was four days FILLED with intense, powerful, and inspiring music. Definitely a life changing/eye opening experience!! I had been to tons of music festivals before, but nothing even touched this one. I was hooked, and I wanted to share my experience with others through my photography. 

After the festival, I compiled a book of my photographs from my experience for a Self Publishing class. It originally started out as a personal project, and after showing it to my friends and classmates, it turned into something much bigger. After a lot of struggle, and with the help of a very good friend, I eventually got my first book printed so that others could enjoy my work for themselves. I sold a few copies but it did not take off like I thought it would. My original plan was to take all the money made from the first book to fund the second book, and then take the money from the second book to fund the third, and so on....But by the time I got the 2012 book finally printed, FF13 had already came and went, and we were now gearing up for 2014. I was able to sell some of my books here and there, but it was not enough to cover the cost of the next production.

So this is what brings me here. My idea is to raise all the funds to get BOTH 2013 and 2014 Farm books printed at the same time, that way I don't have to struggle two more times, I can just do it once and get it over with!

I learned a lot doing this fundraiser (this was my first crowd funding project ever!) and I'm definitely grateful to everyone who supported, shared, critiqued, and contacted me about this project. Although $3,125 is obviously short of my goal, I get to keep most of the donations (minus a 9% fee)  thanks to IndieGoGo's Flexible Funding system. </p>
<p>I have been asked if I'll do another fundraiser. The answer is YES ~ but I'm not sure when I'll put another one online. The biggest lesson I learned from doing this one is to break up my funding goals into chunks so the next fundraiser will probably be for $3,000 or less so that it will be easier for me to meet the goal and to get all the money donated.</p>

While that may bring up images of Halloween, costume players - or ""cosplayers"" - now go all out with painstakingly accurate replicas of their favorite costumes from TV shows, cartoons, comics, and movies. Cosplay has moved from a niche corner of Japanese geekdom to a global pop culture phenomenon that includes the United States.</p>

<p><em>Breaking All the Rules</em> is a photobook that showcases the people behind the costumes. Cosplay is a hobby that breaks all the rules: anyone of any size, any race, any age, any gender, any background, can cosplay. For the past year, I've been traveling around the East Coast taking photos of cosplayers in costume and asking them why they're so in love with this hobby and the culture around it. I'd like to expand my travels to the rest of the country and interview cosplayers around the United States about their personal cosplay stories, and discover more about the history behind cosplaying and fan conventions.</p>
<p>This book will be a compliation of all those photographs and interviews, showcasing cosplayers in their own words. I'm raising funds here on Indiegogo to take the photographs needed for the book, and then design, print, and publish them in a full-color photobook. I don't have the money to make this book happen on my own, but thanks to Indiegogo, I want to make this project a reality.</p>

<p>This is a book for cosplayers, people who love cosplayers, and also those asking what cosplay is. While it may seem strange to express oneself through a costume designed for a fictional character, those characters are the most important part. People's lives are changed by stories, factual or fictional, every day. Those characters in those stories - the characters who they cosplay - have helped people discover new, different parts of themselves. Cosplay is the ultimate tribute, to say that yes, my outlook, my friendships, and my life have forever changed because of this story.<br/><br/> In this book, I'm sharing the new stories that have come about because of these tributes. The cosplayers I'm photographing and interviewing are everyday, ordinary people. They're students, waitresses, software engineers, musicians, chemists, retail assistants, and managers who, several times a year, put on a costume and become outlaws, fallen villains, ingenues, femme fatales, knights, and heroes starting out on their journeys. They are all extraordinary.<br/><br/>Even in the United States there are many hundreds of thousands of cosplayers, more than I could ever fit into a single book. But I hope this book is a beginning. I hope it can start dialogues between people, no matter how diverse their backgrounds. When asked, ""why do you cosplay?"" I hope someone can flip through the pages of this book and point to the cosplayers describing in their own words how cosplay has profoundly changed them and made their world a better place.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm a cosplayer and photographer from Boston, MA. I started cosplaying in 2007 and attended my first convention, Anime Boston, in 2008. Being both a cosplayer and photographer has given me a unique perspective on the cosplay culture in America, and I hope to bring that to life in this book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>You've got more questions? Here are some answers!</h1>
<p>Q: How is this book any different from other books on cosplay, like <em>Cosplay in America</em>?<br/>A: The last thing I want to do is for this book to be perceived as a threat or slight against other people who have published books on cosplay! I don't think that we should stop writing books simply because one or two have already been published on the subject - if that were the case, bookstores would be out of business! I deeply respect the authors of books like <em>Cosplay in America</em>; without people like them, cosplay wouldn't be as widespread as it is today. This book is meant more as a way for cosplayers to tell their stories in their own words. I plan to put emphasis on the interview, with the pictures as an accompaniment. I want to give a voice to cosplayers around the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: $23,244 is a lot of money. Why do you need so much to publish a book?<br/>A:  If the funding goal is reached, Indiegogo takes a 4% cut of any donated funds. Paypal also applies fees (around 3%). I intend to devote the donations first to completing the photo project itself; this inclues airfare to conventions around the country, lodging and other travel costs, equipment maintenance, and photo processing. The remaining funds will go to printing the book, packaging, shipping, and marketing at conventions around the country. I am publishing and printing this book myself in a limited run, and self-publishing is unfortunately incredibly expensive. I absolutely can't make it happen without donors like you.</p>
<p>I have a full funds breakdown and timeline of the project that you can see <a href=""http://www.seventhmoon.org/cosplayphotobook/funding.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here on the book website</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What happens if the donation limit isn't reached?<br/>A: Indiegogo has a wonderful option called ""flexible funding,"" which allows me to keep the money that is raised even if the deadline passes without reaching the goal. However, since most of this money is going to print the books, less money means fewer books, or perhaps lower quality books. I really want to do justice to the cosplayers featured in the book, so I'm crossing my fingers we reach the goal and I can print a really high-quality batch of books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How do I get featured in the book for an interview?<br/>A: All my images are from photos I've taken or will take of cosplayers mostly at different conventions around the country. If you're a U.S. resident, you can fill out the survey form: <a href=""http://goo.gl/XlRIZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/XlRIZ</a>. The survey runs until August 1, 2012. Not all cosplayers who I photograph will be featured, as I'm trying to represent as large a cross-section of the fanbase as I can, but I'll try to fit as many in as possible. Ideally, I'd like there to be around 50 cosplayers in the book. If you're interested in having a photo of yourself in the book by donating $50 or more, please see the next question!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How does the $50 photo perk work?<br/>A: Because I can't possibly feature everyone who wants to be in the book, I'm adding in a special perk for cosplayers who I won't have the chance to interview. By donating $50 or more, you will have the option of sending one photograph of you in costume to be included in a special user-submitted photo section of the book (size tbd, minumum 2""x3"", maximum 4""x6""). The photos will include your name, your hometown, and the year you started cosplaying. Photos may be color or black&amp;white, and may be taken by anyone provided that the photographer gives permission for it to be published. Full information about this perk will be emailed to everyone after the campaign ends on August 30, 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to donate but I see that rewards at the higher tiers are limited. Why?<br/>A: I wish I could reward every single person who wanted to donate, but unfortunately, I have to factor in costs such as shipping the reward, adding extra pages to the book for names of donors, and giving away free books, which takes away from the number of books I have to sell. If the book does well, perhaps I'll have more projects and books to give out in the future!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I want to donate, but I only have $1. Is that okay?<br/>A: Absolutely! Every dollar helps. And even if you don't have money to donate right now, you can still help by letting people know about this campaign, and what I'm trying to do with this project. Sharing the website link and Facebook link are a big help in spreading the word.</p></div>","Thank you everyone who donated! The final total donated was $3,125. I learned a lot doing this fundraiser (this was my first crowd funding project ever!) and I'm definitely grateful to everyone who supported, shared, critiqued, and contacted me about this project. Although $3,125 is obviously short of my goal, I get to keep most of the donations (minus a 9% fee)  thanks to IndieGoGo's Flexible Funding system. 
I have been asked if I'll do another fundraiser. The answer is YES ~ but I'm not sure when I'll put another one online. The biggest lesson I learned from doing this one is to break up my funding goals into chunks so the next fundraiser will probably be for $3,000 or less so that it will be easier for me to meet the goal and to get all the money donated.
For right now, I'm concentrating on traveling and interviewing cosplayers during the last few months of 2012. You can keep up with my travels via the Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/BreakingAllTheRulesCosplay or my blog: http://www.seventhmoon.org/blog where I post my con reports and various articles about people I meet on my journey. Also please visit the main book page, http://www.seventhmoon.org/cosplayphotobook. 
Thank you again for all your support and interest in this book!
