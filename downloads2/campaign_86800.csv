<h2>WHAT'S THE DEAL?!</h2>
<p>Well, Superdivorce formed in 2015 on the heels of the breakup of a band called Sleep Star Ignition (RIP). After Sleep Star closed up shop, three of us from that group decided to continue playing together for fun.</p>
<p>Initially it was me (Villars) on bass, Bender on drums, and our former guitarist, Bob Tallman just getting together once a week and jamming around in my basement. We jokingly agreed to refer to our three man experimental project as 'Superdivorce' until one of us came up with a permanent name.</p>
<p>After some time, however, we realized none of us actually wanted to let go of 'Superdivorce', and so it stuck.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2015 we added a bass player called Dale Hupke and I moved to vocals exclusively. We wrote 10 songs over the course of a few months and recorded the first Superdivorce album 'Wish Ya The Best' in the late autumn of 2015.</p>
<p>WYTB was released in early 2016 and we played a handful of shows around that time. Unfortunately, shortly after the album's release we experienced a hefty dose of band-related turmoil that left the roster cut in half.</p>
<p>By the end of June 2016, our four-piece post-hardcore band had become a duo with an uncertain future. </p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Bender and I decided to move forward as a two-piece synthpop project.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Well, not only are we both suckers for 80s nostalgia of many different flavors, but this is actually the kind of music I've had a mind to create for years!</p>
<p>Though I've been playing in fairly aggressive rock bands for the past 15 years, I mostly listen to new wave and 80s pop music. It's the first music I remember from my childhood. Born in 85, I'm talking very early memories. It's awesome to explore that influence and let it shine through in a big way. </p>
<p>It was a blast writing these songs. It was even more fun going into the studio to see them transform and blossom into the feast of an album that this turned out to be. Our producer, Josh Schroeder, did a world class job helping us make this vision a reality. </p>
<p>Please look forward to 'Action Figures' and place your pre-order today!</p>

<p>To all who don't know me as a person, My name is Terrance Anthony Banks. I am a 31 year old soon to be father. I perform music under the artist name of Soultru, I perform a mix of Soul with Hip-Hop influences while telling my story such as being shelter in my Mothers household and learning of her Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorders as well as things like lost love and overcoming many personal hurdles.  </p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is important because all of the extra money we would have for tour purposes will be going towards the expected baby that my girlfriend Jessica and I are expecting. With your help my friend Colton and I can still head out west for our July tour dates which are all confirmed. In cities such as Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver and a few other stops along the way. Below is a link to something we recorded recently while walking the streets of Chicago the night after a show.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swBA2K40a2M"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swBA2K40a2M</a></p>
<p>The amount I am asking for is to help cover gas costs since we will be driving the full tour to and from the Quad Cities. Any and every contribution is truly appreciated and that's why I will be sending out hand written thank you letters to each and everyone of you.</p>
<p>I'm estimating with all of our traveling 700 dollars would be what we would use roughly in gas. Which would get us to Seattle down the coast and back up to Iowa when it's all said and done. We would still be coming out of pocket for a few hotels and eating purposes but for the most part we will be staying with friends in these major cities. What I am able to offer you in return for your donations are a few merch packages full of stickers, buttons, handwritten thank you letters, unreleased tracks as well as a new tour shirt design. Regardless of if we reach our ultimate goal of 700 dollars we will take what we raise put it in the tank and roll with the punches. Hoping to sell merch to get us the rest of the way at the first few gigs and go from there. Below is a link of our last show in Des Moines finishing off our last tour together.</p>

<p>Your contribution to this campaign would make a huge difference in the grand scheme of where my music goes past this year. With this tour it allows me to get myself in front of tones of new fans because the majority of the dates are through Sofar Sounds, which is a company that hosts intimate stripped back music session in over 400 cities across the globe. Each show we make some guaranteed money and play in front of no less than 50 new fans which in turn helps me to get my name out there even further and allows me to continue to pursue my dream of making a living off of my music. I truly believe god placed me on this earth with the gifts I have to tell my story, to sing my song and to help others who need it.</p>
<p>I'm banking on this to work because without your help tour may not be possible, this is the last tour I will be able to go on seeing that the baby is due Late Sept-Early Oct. as well work is allowing me time off to pursue music. I drive for Fed-Ex as my day job so Fall-Winter cripples me from doing much outside of my area and staying consistent in the music industry is a huge aspect of it. The older I become the more challenges I face as an artist but one thing is that I will never give up on my dream even if I never reach my goal of being a professional everyday musician but at the end of the day no matter what happens at least I tried, I've already done some amazing things but I feel like the best is yet to come. Thank you for your love and support.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are
</span>The Black Rain<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and we are here on Indiegogo asking you to support our project.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Moved by our common
passion for music, last year we recorded and published our debut album “Night
Tales”. The results greatly exceeded our expectations: a huge confirmation in
terms of public that forced us to reprint the CD and excellent reviews by the critics. The number of fans
increased, the audience attending our concerts got larger and larger and all
this gave us the chance to perform also in France and in Greece where we have
been hosted in the most popular TV show “Radio Arvila”.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">These amazing experiences strengthened our enthusiasm and our will to keep playing music.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have new songs for our new album, but now more than ever we need your help to make
it. Together we can.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What we are asking
for is to help us face the costs for recording, mixing, mastering, artwork and
printing of our second CD whose release is foreseen in spring 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Do ut des, Latins
said. Every donation will have in return a reward that we hope will repay you
for the help you are giving us. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have a dream.
Please help us making it real. </span></p>

<p></p>
<br/><h3>Who we are</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Everything started in Bologna in 2002 but we will have to
wait until 2010 to reach our final line-up: Mirko Greco (voice), Eugenio
Bonifazi (guitars), Marco Molteni (bass) and Raffaele Marchesini (drums).</p>
<p>Rock has just a few
formulas and some secret ingredient for sure. Ours is composed by powerful
rhythmics, distorted guitars and a touch of blues. This combination in just a
few years increased more and more the number of fans that attend our concerts.
Due to this success, in 2011 we decided to concentrate on composing new songs
that will be included in our debut album “Night Tales”. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The CD, that since
the very start received a warm welcome both from the public and the critics, was followed by a
promotional tour that took us in France and that made us win the participation
in the main show of Greece, hosted by the most popular TV channel .</p>
<p>If you should attend
one of our concerts remember that “ No one should get out without his dose of
ROCK!!! ""</p>

Hi friends !!!

We are
The Black Rain and we are here on Indiegogo asking you to support our project.
Moved by our common
passion for music, last year we recorded and published our debut album “Night
Tales”. The results greatly exceeded our expectations: a huge confirmation in
terms of public that forced us to reprint the CD and excellent reviews by the critics. The number of fans
increased, the audience attending our concerts got larger and larger and all
this gave us the chance to perform also in France and in Greece where we have
been hosted in the most popular TV show “Radio Arvila”.
These amazing experiences strengthened our enthusiasm and our will to keep playing music.
We have new songs for our new album, but now more than ever we need your help to make
it. Together we can.
What we are asking
for is to help us face the costs for recording, mixing, mastering, artwork and
printing of our second CD whose release is foreseen in spring 2014.
Do ut des, Latins
said. Every donation will have in return a reward that we hope will repay you
for the help you are giving us. 
We have a dream.
Please help us making it real. 
Thanks for your attention.



Who we are

Everything started in Bologna in 2002 but we will have to
wait until 2010 to reach our final line-up: Mirko Greco (voice), Eugenio
Bonifazi (guitars), Marco Molteni (bass) and Raffaele Marchesini (drums).
Rock has just a few
formulas and some secret ingredient for sure. Ours is composed by powerful
rhythmics, distorted guitars and a touch of blues. This combination in just a
few years increased more and more the number of fans that attend our concerts.
Due to this success, in 2011 we decided to concentrate on composing new songs
that will be included in our debut album “Night Tales”. 

The CD, that since
the very start received a warm welcome both from the public and the critics, was followed by a
promotional tour that took us in France and that made us win the participation
in the main show of Greece, hosted by the most popular TV channel .
If you should attend
one of our concerts remember that “ No one should get out without his dose of
ROCK!!! ""

che ci ha visti approdare in Francia e che ci ha fatto guadagnare la
partecipazione alla trasmissione di punta del primo canale televisivo per share
in Grecia.
Se doveste mai capitare ad un nostro show, sappiate che
nessuno di voi andrà via senza aver preso la propria dose di rock.

<p>The Spire Center for Performing Arts is that place.

The Town of Plymouth has provided funding to buy this historic building and upgrade it to today's safety code.They then signed a 100 year lease with our organization to run the facility.

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our building will seat 225 people and will provide audiences a chance to attend musical and theatrical performances up close and personal. We do need the funding we have asked for though before performances can commence. A state of the art sound system is critical to the success of our Center and your contribution will be used to fund its acquistion. </p>
<p>Your contribution of $25 or more will secure your invitation to our grand opening party later this year. A contribution of $100 or more will also give you a 2014 Gold Pass membership featuring discounted tickets and priority seating.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The greater Plymouth area currently has no similar venue within 50 miles which features the type and quality of music and theatre we have in store. We plan musical presentations of many genres so as to appeal to a wider audience and will include folk and acoustic, jazz, Americana, country, classical, rock and others. We already have a theatrical company in residence and scheduled performances by Shakesperean companies and a professional summer stock theatre.</p>
<p>We plan to have a performing arts school and there is space in our large lobby to feature weekly open mic nights and comedy/improv. The volume of activity will be a significant draw for the downtown business area which already features many fine restaurants and places to stay which service the historic tourism industry of Plymouth. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 240px;""><strong>Who I Am</strong></p>
<p><br/> Thank You so much for taking the time to check out this project. I'm extremely inspired by the Latin alternative independent musicians that are creating new sounds by pushing boundaries through the integration of the traditional and the contemporary. As a yogi and a musician/music lover, I've searched for a space where these two worlds could intersect, a type of meditative musical experience to build community outside of the traditional bar or club, and couldn’t find it. That's where you come in, to help support it!</p>
<p>Help me create an intimate and meditative Saturday evening sound ritual exploring intersections of music, culture and community on Saturday, August 24th from 7-10, at the Sitar Arts Center in Washington, DC. The evening in the community arts center will include herbal teas, <em>aguas frescas</em>, nourishing snacks, visuals and the musical delights of Lulacruza.</p>
<p>Lulacruza, an electronic folk duo from Colombia and Argentina, are at the junction of the hypermodern and the ancient. Their music weaves together hypnotic female singing, South American instruments, found sound objects, field recordings, and electronic manipulation. The result is a cross-genre, world-esque music unfolding with mesmerizing vocals, aquatic textures and up-tempo, handcrafted South American rhythms.</p>

Therefore, everything is recorded and ready for post production! However, in order to mix, master, promote, and make physical copies/merch, I simply do not have the means to pay alone.

<p>Portico Church has assembled a team that will share the love of Jesus Christ with these desperate people.  Portico’s missional motto is “Creating Churches for Future Generations”, with a particular emphasis on caring for children and teaching them about Christ. We will support BWCM by <b>building houses, visiting villages, providing food and medicine, supporting local Pastors and Church Plants</b>...... but most importantly we will be <b>sharing the Gospel</b>.  In addition to humanitarian missions, BWCM has a Pastor Training Facility where our senior leaders will serve and have opportunity to teach indigenous Pastors.</p>

Portico Church has assembled a team that will share the love of Jesus Christ with these desperate people.  Portico’s missional motto is “Creating Churches for Future Generations”, with a particular emphasis on caring for children and teaching them about Christ. We will support BWCM by building houses, visiting villages, providing food and medicine, supporting local Pastors and Church Plants...... but most importantly we will be sharing the Gospel.  In addition to humanitarian missions, BWCM has a Pastor Training Facility where our senior leaders will serve and have opportunity to teach indigenous Pastors.
What We Need 
Kathleen and I are heading to Nicaragua for seven days in mid-March, and we’re excited to ask you to consider supporting us through prayer (before and during the trip) and financially. Kathleen and I are raising a combined $2,900 ($1,450 each) to fund our trip, which we need to raise by Feb 14, 2015. FYI: We set the goal for IndieGoGo for $1,500, as we expect many people will mail in checks instead of using IndieGoGo.  We would love your financial support as we prepare for this adventure.  If you are interested in supporting us, please contribute here at IndieGoGo (Note:  IndieGoGo contributions are not tax deductible). 

    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Let other people know about our adventure -- you could post this to social media like Facebook
Pray for us before and during our adventure!

Thanks for reading this -- we're excited to share details of our adventure with you after we get back from Nicaragua,

In our current season, we feature existing works by St. Vincent, Richard Reed Parry (Arcade Fire), Seth Timbs, and Charlie Haden, among others. We want to do more. We've created this indiegogo campaign to support the commission of a work from <a href=""http://www.brookewaggoner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brooke Waggoner</a>, a Nashville-based singer-songwriter <span>we’ve listened to and loved for years </span>who has achieved international acclaim for her work.

</div></div>","chatterbird is a group of Nashville musicians who are dedicated to exploring uniquely orchestrated chamber music.


We love performing classical music that skirts traditional boundaries, sliding between classical, jazz, hip-hop, rock, avant-garde, and country, creating a thoughtful and inventive way to discover and experience modern classical music. We bring cutting-edge chamber music repertoire into spaces where you wouldn’t typically find it - bars, galleries, breweries, basements, and everywhere in between.  chatterbird formed in 2014 and had a smashing debut.


THE PROJECT:
Part of what we love most is featuring music of living composers who don't usually work within the classical genre. In our current season, we feature existing works by St. Vincent, Richard Reed Parry (Arcade Fire), Seth Timbs, and Charlie Haden, among others. We want to do more. We've created this indiegogo campaign to support the commission of a work from Brooke Waggoner, a Nashville-based singer-songwriter we’ve listened to and loved for years who has achieved international acclaim for her work. Brooke's writing is exquisitely beautiful, lush, and vibrant. She has a unique and strong artistic voice that we really believe in (scroll down and have a listen yourself!)




Brooke is hard at work on a commission for chatterbird that will be premiered at our concert in Summer 2015. The large-scale programmatic work, titled MINOR-BORN, is based on her poetry. 


Support for her commission will not only jump-start an exciting and important contribution to the growing body of new chamber music, but it will keep building upon the bold inter-genre collaborations already happening in the classical world. These conversations are so important to the vitality and growth of classical music.

 Nashville is such a special place. It's a melting pot of talent, and we want to challenge people to think differently about the things they create and consume, especially around classical music. Help us bring this original project to life!

PERKS:
We have some fun and interesting perks for you, from handmade and delicious cookies to signed merch to MYSTERIOUS TREASURE CHESTS to a special VIP experience with us (we're fun, promise). We'd love to shower you with gifts!

WHAT WE NEED:

<li>Hi! My name is Caitlin Novakowski.  In October, 2014, Big Noise, Scotland’s El sistema-inspired program will hold the International Sistema Teachers’ Conference in Stirling, Scotland.  I will be representing Sistema New Brunswick and participating in this unique immersive experience shaped by teachers for teachers. I have a strong desire for professional development within the el Sistema global movement and my connection to other people working in Sistema-inspired programs has encouraged me to consistently realign my teaching to reflect my philosophy that every student, regardless of background or ability, should have the opportunity to grow and be confident through a community of music.</li> <li>We show our students that striving towards excellence is important when practicing an instrument and playing in an orchestra. I believe striving towards excellence is something teaching artists should practice as professionals. When we strive for excellence and celebrate one another as a catalyst for social change, we discover unanimity of purpose and shared responsibilities; we can refresh and hone our joint philosophies of music as a tool for social change.</li> <li>By contributing to this project,  you will form a partnership with me in the El Sistema-inspired movement - and together, we will connect with global leaders, share innovative ideas and discover the inspirations and challenges of what it's like living out the possibility of transformative social change through music and the orchestra!  </li> </ul>

</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>Being part of an orchestra means you belong and are expected to do the right thing. Last week was the third week for our new students at Sistema Saint John. All beginning students made their own paper instruments out of papier maché and are now sitting proudly in rest, ready and playing position, they are learning basic rhythms, notes and are singing songs about the orchestra. At our centre, 'caring and sharing', 'hands are for helping' and 'doing the right thing' are widely known, modelled, and celebrated. One day, I was walking back to my classroom when I saw one of the teachers talking to a student who was ready for violin class before everyone else. She said to him, ""You know what, I bet if you sat in your chair in ready position, Miss. Rachel would be so surprised and proud of you!"" So the wide-eyed 6-year-old violinist raced to his chair, carefully picked up his paper violin and sat down with excellent posture. He held his violin carefully and rested it on one leg. He did this by himself for 3 minutes, with poise. It was a wonderful moment!</li>
<li>This project is valuable to me as a teacher, but more importantly, the knowledge that I will gain and share with our teachers will be valuable to the children of Saint John and other communities in New Brunswick. We have demonstrated that great art is for everyone and that it has the power to improve the lives of children and their families and enhance our society. We have shown that for children, an orchestra means joy, motivation, discipline, teamwork - that builds confidence and self-esteem and that it is incredibly fun.

I am primarily known as an acoustic blues artist, but I also play other types of American roots music, including old-time, Cajun, swing, soul. I have put out 7 albums in the past 20 years, 4 of them Juno-nominated, and all of them available on the Borealis label (<a href=""https://borealisrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://borealisrecords.com</a>). I tour mainly solo (I’ve won the Canadian Folk Music Award for Solo Artist twice) in Canada, the US and Europe.</p><p>I started playing music when I was 9 years old, and was immediately attracted to the blues. I got on stage for the first time when I was 14, and haven’t stopped since. In my teens I got interested in other forms of American music, all of which have a connection to the blues. Soul music is no exception, it is connected to the blues as a child is to its mother. In the ‘60s the two genres blended seamlessly. Artists like Bobby “Blue” Bland, Jimmy McCracklin and Lowell Fulson were identified as both blues and soul. The gospel foundation is what makes it soul. On this new album (working title: “That’s Where It’s At”) I will do some original songs and interpret classics using traditional fingerstyle blues guitar techniques to create fresh versions. This means some open tunings, some slide here and there, and the ever-present percussive thumb. There will be songs by artists like Bobby Bland, Lowell Fulson, Al Green, and Sam Cooke, and there will be at least 2 original songs co-written with B.A. Markus and a couple of original instrumentals. </p><p>My blues-influenced acoustic guitar will be the foundation of this record. The only other instrumentalist will be drummer/percussionist John McColgan, who I’ve worked closely with for 30 years, and who will be on some of the tracks. The other guests will be vocalists: Harrison Kennedy, Roxanne Potvin and Eric Bibb. By contributing to this campaign, you can help us create some awesome soul duets!</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>We need $14,500 CAD to complete this album. This will cover studio time (tracking and mixing: $6,000), which will happen at Audio Bec Studio in Sherbrooke, Quebec; Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario; and Fast Forward Studio here in Montreal. Musicians’ fees will be $1,000 (this may seem low but some of the artists are bartering their services). Hotels and transportation (car rentals, gas) will be $1,400; Mastering will be $750; photography and cover design will be $1,700; getting the licenses for the non-original songs will be $1,000. This brings us to a sub-total of $11,850. If we add $425 for credit card fees, and $725 for Indiegogo’s 5% commission, we now have $13,000. Another $1,500 will cover miscellaneous expenses such as food, shipping and manufacturing of perks, which brings us to our goal of $14,500.</p><p>Borealis Records is committed to manufacturing, releasing, and promoting the album. I’ve been with them since 2001, and they have put out six of my albums, plus a compilation and a re-issue of my first. They always have had faith in what I do, and I am very grateful to have them behind me. </p><p>PERKS! Before we get to the perks, here are three important points:</p><p>    -First of all, if you’re not interested in the perks, you can simply click on BACK IT at the top of the page, and contribute whatever amount you want.</p><p>    -Second, all contributions are in Canadian dollars. One Canadian dollar is worth about $0.80 US dollars, depending on the exchange rate of the day. If you’re contributing from outside Canada, your currency will be converted into CAD.</p><p>   -Third, if you want a CD, make sure you click on the perk that includes shipping to your country. It will either say Canada or International (Int'l) for all other countries. </p><p>All right, here are the PERKS:</p><p>   - For $25, if you live in Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home.</p><p>   - For $35, if you live in Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home, + an exclusive bonus download of some live recordings I will be making in Port Townsend, WA, USA, in September.</p><p>   - For $35, if you live outside of Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home.</p><p>   - For $45, if you live outside of Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home, + an exclusive bonus download of some live recordings I will be making in Port Townsend, WA, USA, in September.</p><p>   - For $100, I will give you a guitar less on (or banjo, fiddle, mandolin) in your home, if you live within an hour of central Montreal by public transit. If you live further out, you can come to me.</p><p>   -For $750, I will do a house concert or workshop in your home, for your friends and family, provided you live within a 100 km radius of Montreal. If you live further away, we can discuss the transportation costs involved. You will also receive one copy of the new CD.</p><p>   -For $1000, you will get an “Executive Producer” credit on the album, and 2 copies of the new CD shipped to your home.</p><p>   </p><p>If I don’t reach my goal (depending on how far short I fall), I will apply for a Canada Council Grant in September. These grants are much harder to get than they used to be, and they require shaping the project to fit the criteria of the grant (hence this campaign), so let’s hope the campaign works! (With your help, I know it will).</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>This is my first crowdfunding campaign, but not my first album (it’ll be my 8th). 4 of my 7 albums were nominated for Juno Awards, and my recent co-production with Eric Bibb and JJ Milteau, “Migration Blues,” was nominated for a Grammy. I’m very grateful that I’ve been able to play music all these years, from my coffee house and busking days in the ‘70s and ‘80s through the peak years of the Stephen Barry Band in the ‘90s, working as a sideman for Vann “Piano Man” Walls, Susie Arioli, Jordan Officer, Eric Bibb and others over the years, and the last 20 years of making my own recordings and touring on my own. You can help me continue on this journey.</p><p>The point of making a new recording is to get the music out there. But it’s not just about making a CD and digital download that people can acquire. A new album helps create a buzz which helps me book the gigs so I can come play for you! So by contributing to this project, in the long run you are facilitating a live performance that you may be able to experience. Live music: That's Where It's At! (Working title).</p><p>For this new recording I want to focus on the soul side of my repertoire, and its connection to the blues. Soul music is often blamed for people turning their backs on the blues in the 1960s, but I see it as the next step in an evolution, the moment when it got an infusion of gospel music and took off in a different direction, but maintaining its blues roots. I have adapted modern blues and soul songs to the techniques of early blues fingerstyle guitar, and aside from some drums and percussion on a few songs (John McColgan), my guitars and the vocals will be the only instruments. I’ve enlisted some great vocalists that I admire: Eric Bibb, Roxanne Potvin, and Harrison Kennedy. I can’t wait for you to hear my collaborations with these people. Help me make it happen!</p><p>Another collaborator worthy of mention is Larry O’Malley, the fabulous recording engineer at Audio Bec in Sherbrooke, Quebec. I’ve worked with him since 1994, and he has recorded and/or mixed all of my albums, as well as Eric Bibb’s Grammy-nominated “Migration Blues.” If there’s anyone who can make my solo acoustic guitars sound big, to fill in all the space when there’s nothing but that and the voices, it’s Larry. He’s done such a great job on all my album, and he keeps getting better. Most of the album will be recorded at his studio, and all of it will be mixed there. I have the utmost confidence that he will make us all sound fantastic!</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Here’s a big challenge: is there still an audience for real music played by real people? I keep hearing about how artificial intelligence will be writing the hits of the future. I believe there still is an audience, and always will be. People yearn for that human contact when they get close to someone who is playing and singing. And people want to hear a recording that resembles the show they just saw. They will get that with this album. Overdubs will be minimal, mostly it will be live off the floor. The audience for roots music is definitely ageing, but more and more I see young people coming out to acoustic music shows. Live music: That’s Where It’s At!</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p><i>​</i>If contributing money is not easy for you right now, there are other ways you can help. Please share this with as many people as you can, via Email, social media, and the Indiegogo share tools. The more people know about the campaign, the more likely I am to reach my goal.</p></div>","Short Summary(pour voir ce résumé en français, cliquez: https://michaeljeromebrowne.com/indiegogo-francais)If you don’t already know me, I am Michael Jerome Browne.

There will be songs by artists like Bobby Bland, Lowell Fulson, Al Green, and Sam Cooke, and there will be at least 2 original songs co-written with B.A. Markus and a couple of original instrumentals. My blues-influenced acoustic guitar will be the foundation of this record. The only other instrumentalist will be drummer/percussionist John McColgan, who I’ve worked closely with for 30 years, and who will be on some of the tracks. The other guests will be vocalists: Harrison Kennedy, Roxanne Potvin and Eric Bibb. By contributing to this campaign, you can help us create some awesome soul duets!What We Need & What You GetWe need $14,500 CAD to complete this album. This will cover studio time (tracking and mixing: $6,000), which will happen at Audio Bec Studio in Sherbrooke, Quebec; Grant Avenue Studio in Hamilton, Ontario; and Fast Forward Studio here in Montreal. Musicians’ fees will be $1,000 (this may seem low but some of the artists are bartering their services). Hotels and transportation (car rentals, gas) will be $1,400; Mastering will be $750; photography and cover design will be $1,700; getting the licenses for the non-original songs will be $1,000. This brings us to a sub-total of $11,850. If we add $425 for credit card fees, and $725 for Indiegogo’s 5% commission, we now have $13,000. Another $1,500 will cover miscellaneous expenses such as food, shipping and manufacturing of perks, which brings us to our goal of $14,500.Borealis Records is committed to manufacturing, releasing, and promoting the album. I’ve been with them since 2001, and they have put out six of my albums, plus a compilation and a re-issue of my first. They always have had faith in what I do, and I am very grateful to have them behind me. PERKS! Before we get to the perks, here are three important points:    -First of all, if you’re not interested in the perks, you can simply click on BACK IT at the top of the page, and contribute whatever amount you want.    -Second, all contributions are in Canadian dollars. One Canadian dollar is worth about $0.80 US dollars, depending on the exchange rate of the day. If you’re contributing from outside Canada, your currency will be converted into CAD.   -Third, if you want a CD, make sure you click on the perk that includes shipping to your country. It will either say Canada or International (Int'l) for all other countries. All right, here are the PERKS:   - For $25, if you live in Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home.   - For $35, if you live in Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home, + an exclusive bonus download of some live recordings I will be making in Port Townsend, WA, USA, in September.   - For $35, if you live outside of Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home.   - For $45, if you live outside of Canada, you can get a copy of the new CD delivered to your home, + an exclusive bonus download of some live recordings I will be making in Port Townsend, WA, USA, in September.   - For $100, I will give you a guitar less on (or banjo, fiddle, mandolin) in your home, if you live within an hour of central Montreal by public transit. If you live further out, you can come to me.   -For $750, I will do a house concert or workshop in your home, for your friends and family, provided you live within a 100 km radius of Montreal. If you live further away, we can discuss the transportation costs involved. You will also receive one copy of the new CD.   -For $1000, you will get an “Executive Producer” credit on the album, and 2 copies of the new CD shipped to your home.   If I don’t reach my goal (depending on how far short I fall), I will apply for a Canada Council Grant in September. These grants are much harder to get than they used to be, and they require shaping the project to fit the criteria of the grant (hence this campaign), so let’s hope the campaign works! (With your help, I know it will).The ImpactThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, but not my first album (it’ll be my 8th). 4 of my 7 albums were nominated for Juno Awards, and my recent co-production with Eric Bibb and JJ Milteau, “Migration Blues,” was nominated for a Grammy. I’m very grateful that I’ve been able to play music all these years, from my coffee house and busking days in the ‘70s and ‘80s through the peak years of the Stephen Barry Band in the ‘90s, working as a sideman for Vann “Piano Man” Walls, Susie Arioli, Jordan Officer, Eric Bibb and others over the years, and the last 20 years of making my own recordings and touring on my own. You can help me continue on this journey.The point of making a new recording is to get the music out there. But it’s not just about making a CD and digital download that people can acquire. A new album helps create a buzz which helps me book the gigs so I can come play for you! So by contributing to this project, in the long run you are facilitating a live performance that you may be able to experience. Live music: That's Where It's At! (Working title).For this new recording I want to focus on the soul side of my repertoire, and its connection to the blues. Soul music is often blamed for people turning their backs on the blues in the 1960s, but I see it as the next step in an evolution, the moment when it got an infusion of gospel music and took off in a different direction, but maintaining its blues roots. I have adapted modern blues and soul songs to the techniques of early blues fingerstyle guitar, and aside from some drums and percussion on a few songs (John McColgan), my guitars and the vocals will be the only instruments. I’ve enlisted some great vocalists that I admire: Eric Bibb, Roxanne Potvin, and Harrison Kennedy. I can’t wait for you to hear my collaborations with these people. Help me make it happen!Another collaborator worthy of mention is Larry O’Malley, the fabulous recording engineer at Audio Bec in Sherbrooke, Quebec. I’ve worked with him since 1994, and he has recorded and/or mixed all of my albums, as well as Eric Bibb’s Grammy-nominated “Migration Blues.” If there’s anyone who can make my solo acoustic guitars sound big, to fill in all the space when there’s nothing but that and the voices, it’s Larry. He’s done such a great job on all my album, and he keeps getting better. Most of the album will be recorded at his studio, and all of it will be mixed there. I have the utmost confidence that he will make us all sound fantastic!Risks & ChallengesHere’s a big challenge: is there still an audience for real music played by real people? I keep hearing about how artificial intelligence will be writing the hits of the future. I believe there still is an audience, and always will be. People yearn for that human contact when they get close to someone who is playing and singing. And people want to hear a recording that resembles the show they just saw. They will get that with this album. Overdubs will be minimal, mostly it will be live off the floor. The audience for roots music is definitely ageing, but more and more I see young people coming out to acoustic music shows. Live music: That’s Where It’s At!Other Ways You Can Help​If contributing money is not easy for you right now, there are other ways you can help. Please share this with as many people as you can, via Email, social media, and the Indiegogo share tools.

Then Ask!</b></i>"" contains 9 new songs plus a cover of legendary US Thrashers DÉTENTE, recorded at <i>Blood Cadillac Studios</i> by <i>Andy C.</i> who's also doing the mix &amp; mastering. Cover artwork was done by the well known artist <i>Andrei Bouzikov</i> (Municipal Waste, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch...) and it's also a total 80's looking piece of art! We were thinking about a transcendental &amp; abstract post-modern cover full of intellectual meaning behind, but... what the fuck!! A Thrash Metal album deserves a Thrash Metal artwork, haha!!<br/><br/>      Even if the album will be released on <i>Xtreem Music</i> on 1st of February 2017, we are conscious that this is the underground and with such low and decreasing sales on physical formats, labels can't afford to pay studio &amp; artwork costs that later will be difficult to recover, so we're financing everything by ourselves. For a relatively new band like us, of course it's quite some money, but we believe we're bringinig hell of a fucking awesome album and hopefully with your help by pre-ordering any of our items &amp; combos, we'll get back, if not all, at least a good part of what we're investing in ""<i><b>Annihilate...

Un álbum de Thrash Metal merece un arte Thrash Metal, jaja!!<br/><br/>      Aunque el álbum será editado en <i>Xtreem Music</i> el 1 de Febrero de 2017, somos conscientes de que esto es el underground y con tan bajas y decrecientes ventas en formatos físicos, los sellos no se pueden permitir pagar costes de estudio y arte que luego difícilmente van a recuperar, así que estamos financiando todo nosotros mismos. Por supuesto, para una banda relativamente nueva como nosotros, esto es bastante dinero, pero creemos que estamos pariendo un álbum increíble y ojalá que con vuestra ayuda haciendo pre-pedidos de nuestros artículos y combos, recuperemos, si no todo, al menos una buena parte de lo que estamos invirtiendo en ""<i><b>Annihilate... Then Ask!</b></i>"".<br/><br/><b><font color=""#FF0000"">AYUDANOS A CUMPLIR ESTE PROYECTO!!</font></b></font></p>

Hi Thrashers!      HOLYCIDE is finishing the mixing and mastering process of the debut full length album ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" which will be a total madness for all lovers of good old 80's styled Thrash Metal.      ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" contains 9 new songs plus a cover of legendary US Thrashers DÉTENTE, recorded at Blood Cadillac Studios by Andy C. who's also doing the mix & mastering. Cover artwork was done by the well known artist Andrei Bouzikov (Municipal Waste, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch...) and it's also a total 80's looking piece of art! We were thinking about a transcendental & abstract post-modern cover full of intellectual meaning behind, but... what the fuck!! A Thrash Metal album deserves a Thrash Metal artwork, haha!!      Even if the album will be released on Xtreem Music on 1st of February 2017, we are conscious that this is the underground and with such low and decreasing sales on physical formats, labels can't afford to pay studio & artwork costs that later will be difficult to recover, so we're financing everything by ourselves. For a relatively new band like us, of course it's quite some money, but we believe we're bringinig hell of a fucking awesome album and hopefully with your help by pre-ordering any of our items & combos, we'll get back, if not all, at least a good part of what we're investing in ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"".HELP US TO ACHIEVE THIS PROJECT!!


S P A N I S H
Hey Thrashers!      HOLYCIDE se encuentra finalizando el proceso de mezcla y masterización del debut álbum completo ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" que será una total locura para todos los amantes del buen viejo Thrash al estilo de los '80.      ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" contiene 9 nuevos temas y una versión de los legendarios Thrashers americanos DÉTENTE, grabado en los Blood Cadillac Studios con Andy C. que también se encarga de la mezcla y masterización. El arte de la portada ha corrido a cargo del conocido artista Andrei Bouzikov (Municipal Waste, Toxic Holocaust, Skeletonwitch...) y es también un dibujo a estilo total mente de los '80! Estuvimos pensando en hacer una portada post-moderna transcendental y asbtracta llena de significado intelectual, pero... qué cojones!! Un álbum de Thrash Metal merece un arte Thrash Metal, jaja!!      Aunque el álbum será editado en Xtreem Music el 1 de Febrero de 2017, somos conscientes de que esto es el underground y con tan bajas y decrecientes ventas en formatos físicos, los sellos no se pueden permitir pagar costes de estudio y arte que luego difícilmente van a recuperar, así que estamos financiando todo nosotros mismos. Por supuesto, para una banda relativamente nueva como nosotros, esto es bastante dinero, pero creemos que estamos pariendo un álbum increíble y ojalá que con vuestra ayuda haciendo pre-pedidos de nuestros artículos y combos, recuperemos, si no todo, al menos una buena parte de lo que estamos invirtiendo en ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"".AYUDANOS A CUMPLIR ESTE PROYECTO!!




      Please, spread this campaign as much as you can and encourage your friends to participate!! The more money we get, more we'll invest in printing merchandise and perhaps some video-clip... who knows!!      Unfortunately we only have the chance to accept payments through PAYPAL, so those of you who don't have an account, you can always ask a favour to some friend, he pay for it and later you pay to him somehow, hehe!!
      Por favor, difunde esta campaña todo lo que puedas y anima a tus amigos a participar!! Cuanto más dinero recaudemos, más invertiremos en fabricar merchandise y quizás un video-clip... quién sabe!!      Lamentablemente sólo tenemos la posibilidad de aceptar pagos por PAYPAL, así que los que no tengáis cuenta, siempre podríais pedir un favor a algún amigo que la tenga, que la pague el y luego se lo pagáis como sea, jeje!! 



      Release date for ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" is planned for 1st of February 2017, but we'll need to be manufacturing everything during november & December to get it ready by January and mail out all pre-orders during that month.
      La fecha de salida para ""Annihilate... Then Ask!"" está prevista para el 1 de Febrero de 2017, pero necesitaremos ir fabricando todo durante el Noviembre y Diciember para tenerlo listo en Enero y enviar todos estos pre-pedidos durante ese mismo mes.



 



IMPORTANT
      If you want to buy different packs, since there's no way the system combine them all into one (there's no shopping cart), you must buy separately and after you buy, write us an email to holycide@gmail.com and we'll apply combined shipping and refund the difference to you, OK?      Size for the T-shirt, please write it on the 2nd field for the addrress, OK?


IMPORTANTE
      Si quieres comprar diferentes packs, ya que no hay forma de que el sistema los combine en uno (no hay carrito), debes comprarlos por separado y tras la compra, escríbenos un email a holycide@gmail.com y te aplicaremos el envío combinado devolviéndote la diferencia, OK?      La talla de la camiseta, escríbela en la segunda línea que hay para la dirección, OK?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Westchester Chorale was organized in 1965 by Harold Aks of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York. An auditioned avocational chorus, the Chorale has been a proud contributor to the musical life of Westchester County for the past 46 years. Throughout its history, the Chorale’s high standards of musicianship and collaboration with professional vocal soloists and instrumentalists have brought critical praise and renown. Currently, we are proud to be the chorus-in-residence at the Larchmont Avenue Church under the baton of maestro Douglas Kostner.<br/></p>
<p>We are now rehearsing for our December 2011 concert, ""A Feast of Magnificats,"" with choral works by John Rutter, Charles Stanford, Richard Shephard, and our own Douglas Kostner. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To fund our concerts, we rely on member contributions, ticket sales, and donations from music lovers like you. This past year, the recession has really taken a toll on our fund-raising efforts and we need to fill a budget short-fall of about $3,000 in order to pay all of our concert-related expenses. If we don't raise the money, we will not be able to afford subsidized tickets for seniors and students, extra rehearsals with choral professionals, or music rentals for our spring 2012 concert, and it will be tough to attract an audience without any budget for even the most modest advertising in the local paper or printing flyers to distribute locally.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we said, our budget short-fall is about $3,000. The money will be used to pay for choral professionals at additional rehearsals, ticket subsidies for the elderly and for students, fees for our soloists and for space rental, as well as music rentals and expenses for our spring 2012 concert. Even if we don't raise the whole amount, every little bit will help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To sweeten the pot, we're offering a bunch o' nifty giveaways as a heartfelt ""thank you"" for your donation! They'll be available for pickup at the box-office for our December 10th concert at the Larchmont Avenue Church, 60 Forest Park Avenue in Larchmont, New York. Non-physical items (like the evening with author Susan G. Bell or the house in the Catskills) will expire one year from the concert date, or December 10th, 2012. Thanks again and enjoy!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate right now, please let other folks know about our IndieGoGo campaign and let them know about our concert at the Larchmont Avenue Church (60 Forest Park Avenue in Larchmont, NY) at 4:30PM on December 10th! The bigger our audience, the greater our ticket sales will be and the smaller our budget deficit - so please spread the word! And, of course, if you know other choral music lovers, please share this link with them so they can donate, too. Thanks!</p>

I am continuously grateful for their feedback and I challenge myself to create a unique sound and evolve as an artist. I stay true to myself, to my lyrics, and to my sound. I am not a label specific sound or genre. I’m soul, pop, rock, funk, blues or jazz all at once. I am a singer-songwriter and my genre is music. My voice is my instrument brought to life by the emotions and lyrics I have written. I write stories into songs and each story has a different path or sound but in the end they all still sound like me. A multitude of genres all on one album.

A project of this magnitude takes time, hard work, patience and financing. My growth as an artist has lead me to this moment; the next level of my career. I put my heart and soul into these 10 songs. I travelled from Sudbury to the studio in North Bay on a weekly basis for the past 6 months. This album would not be possible without the incredibly talented and Juno nominated producer/engineer Ben Leggett. The experience has been like no other. I was introduced to a remarkable group of talented musicians who came to the studio to help bring these songs to life. We recorded a grand piano inside a church, added some organ, brought in some cello and of course the usual suspects of electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass, drums and 4 different back up vocalists. I am incredibly proud of the outcome. The musicians on my new album have become my band mates and my family. (Check them out in the credits below). The album [This Is Me] will be released this October with CD’s and a limited release of Vinyl. A release party will be held in Sudbury, North Bay and Collingwood, followed by live shows supporting the album throughout Canada.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>This Is You</strong></h3><p>Your support over the years has given me the courage and the strength to better myself on stage, to reach larger goals, and to give you my best. Your support in this campaign doesn’t necessarily mean you have to spend your hard earned money. A simple Facebook share or shout out is more than I can ask for, and I truly do appreciate it!

I look forward to seeing you all again very soon as I continue this amazing journey into the wonderful world of music.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Where Does The Money Go?</strong></h3><p>Recording an independent album is very expensive. There are studio costs, hiring of a sound engineer/producer and professional musicians, mixing and mastering, album artwork, album photography, marketing, distribution, printing, pressing CD’s and Vinyl, travel costs and much more. I was fortunate to receive a grant from the Ontario Arts Council to help cover some of the costs of recording in the studio along with my personal savings. The recording is finalized and the mixing and mastering will be completed this summer. The next big step is CD’s and Vinyl and the main reason for this campaign.

<h3>The Opera</h3>
<p><i>Thumbprint</i> is inspired by the extraordinary transformation of Mukhtar Mai, a young illiterate woman whose world was shattered by an act of brutality that could have destroyed her. Instead, she discovers a weapon– her voice – and against all odds, to the astonishment of her country and herself, she seeks justice and finds it. The worst thing in my life is also the best, she says: it has given my life meaning.</p>
<p>The music draws equally on South Asian styles (including Hindustani raga and tala, Pakistani Qawwali music, and 60s Bollywood) and the Western operatic tradition. The libretto by Susan Yankowitz originates from her original monologue and personal interviews with Mai.</p>
<p><i>Thumbprint</i> premiered in the 2014 PROTOTYPE Festival in New York City, and will have its West Coast premiere at LA Opera, running from June 15-18th. <a href=""https://www.laopera.org/season/16-17-season/Thumbprint/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(More information and tickets here).</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Recording</h3>
<p>We have the opportunity to make a commercial-quality recording from the LA premiere. We have the funding to cover the cost of the actual recording, but we need additional funding to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3000 for additional fees for the conductor, singers, and instrumental ensemble</li>
<li>$5000 for mixing and mastering</li>
<li>$2000 for CD duplication and graphic design</li>

<h3><u>Who are we?</u></h3>
<p>For those who don't know us, we are <a href=""http://www.brandenjames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BRANDEN &amp; JAMES</strong></a>, a very unique cello-vocal duo. We play classical versions of pop-tunes and some originals as well. We've spent the last two years perfecting our sound and promoting a message of authenticity and transparency. The passion comes through in our music and has provided a wealth of work and opportunity to continue playing concerts around the world--many of which YOU have come to! </p>
<p><b>BRANDEN</b> is an operatic tenor originally from Southern California, who spent years singing in America’s top opera houses, and then later was a finalist on America’s Got Talent.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsO59onuFM4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>JAMES</strong>, an Aussie from Adelaide, is a high school music teacher turned performer, who has had the privilege of performing with Olivia Newton-John, Bernadette Peters, and Idina Menzel amongst many others. In addition, James has been the musical mastermind behind all of our very distinctive arrangements.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjrayLuwr6E?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>We formed as a duo in 2015, and have been playing in all sorts of venues across The United States, Mexico, South Africa, and Australia. We've also traversed the globe playing our unique shows on luxury cruise liners. Because of this, we've been lucky enough to already reach thousands of people with our music. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Ins &amp; Outs</u></h3>
<p>With your help, we now have the opportunity to make a GLOBAL impact with our music.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This album features a 14-piece studio orchestra, complete with strings, woodwinds, piano, bass, and percussion.  Appearing on the album will be both familiar covers from decades new and old, and exciting original songs composed by Academy, Grammy, Dove Award winning songwriters. Our producer, <a href=""http://www.the-globe.be/people-patrick.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patrick Hamilton</a> is a major player in the classical-crossover world. We have handed the reigns over to him to provide us with world-class production and fresh, new arrangements that have completely enhanced our sound. </p>
<p><strong>Joining us on the album is a very special celebrity guest singer. We couldn’t be more thrilled to collaborate with this consummate artist. Please stay tuned for an announcement from us later in the campaign.</strong></p>
<p>You'll get to go behind the scenes with us and see exclusive sneak peeks from our time in the studio in Belgium, listen to teasers of some recordings as they become available, and feel the excitement of our progress as we get closer to reaching our goal. </p>
<p>We need at least $50,000 in order to record the album with Patrick. This covers the producer fees only, so our IDEAL GOAL is actually $100,000 which would pay for the following:</p>
<p>PRODUCTION COSTS (rights to cover songs, songwriter fees, production of physical copies, album artwork, etc.)</p>
<p>PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION (album artwork and design, photo shoots, publicizing the album and our brand once it’s complete and shopping the album around to potential labels)</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTION (release of the album, assuring it gets in the ears of everyone possible through streaming platforms, digital outlets, and music sharing sites)</p>
<p>We took a big risk by taking on this recording project, but from the results we've heard so far, we believe it will be incredibly rewarding for all of us! </p>
<h3><u>PERKS: everything you need to know!</u></h3>
<p>Perks are incentives offered to you, our album backers in exchange for your support. We've created some amazing perks for this campaign. We think there are some very special and personalized experiences on offer, but no matter how much you donate,  <strong>a digital download of the album is coming your way. </strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>How your support will help us</u></h3>
<p>The affirmation we’ve received from all of you confirms that, although we’ve only been playing together a couple of years, we were <strong><i>meant</i> </strong>to be doing this. YOU—our family of listeners, fans and supporters have helped define us and shape us from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Just like Billy Joel, we got our start in a piano bar. With each year, we’re expanding to new and exciting venues to play at across North America and beyond: Performing arts centers, world-famous cabaret venues such as 54 Below in New York City, universities, and celebrity-filled charity events. </p>
<p>This is such an important step for us in our journey as artists. Producing an album of this quality is expensive, but with your support, we will continue to grow and develop at a faster rate than we could ever achieve by ourselves. By asking for your support, we are effectively making YOU the producers of our album. We are recording this album because we want to inspire more people in the way that many of you have already been inspired. We also want to offer something new and fresh to those of you who have been following us since the beginning.</p>
</div>
<div><p>We took a huge risk and have already spent the initial $50,000 to make this album. But we have faith in our fans and in our work thus far, that we're making the right decision. </p></div>
<div>
<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>While not everyone can contribute money to our campaign, (don’t worry, we totally understand) there are other ways you can help us. Start by getting the word out there to anyone and everyone about our campaign. <strong>Share the campaign</strong> through Indiegogo, or on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can always email your friends directly, too. The more people who hear about the campaign, the more likely we are to succeed!</p>

</div>
<p><strong>1. Digital Downloads</strong> will be available to you as soon as the album is released. </p>
<p><strong>2. Physical Copies signed CD’s</strong> and signed download cards will take a bit longer as we’ll be 3. depending on manufacturing deadlines and the good old postal service for these. But we’ll email with updates and notify you once it’s shipped. </p>
<p><strong>3. The 54 Below LIVE Recording </strong>will take place when we perform there on October, 18, 2018. Once we have the performance mixed and mastered, we will send out the recording as a digital download.</p>
<p><strong>4. Branden’s memoir</strong> is set to be released sometime in 2019. This has been a huge year for us, adding a 65,000 word book to our line-up of work. But we’ve been thrilled to spread our wings into new and uncharted territory. Generally, books are released within one year of the manuscript deadline (which is October, 2018). So sit tight! We’ll send some secret excerpts from the book to everyone who buys it and the signed copy will come just as soon as we get our hands on it. </p>
<p><strong>5. To redeem the 2 VIP tickets</strong>, check our website for our upcoming tour dates, and notify us at least 30 days in advance of the show date, and we’ll take care of the reservation for you. We’ll also give you a big, giant hug after the show. These tickets are only available within Australia, the continental United States and Mexico and do not include cruises or any concerts of a private nature. Only ticketed events are available for redemption. Purchaser is responsible for providing their own travel to and from the venue and subsequent accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>6. The Virtual Concert</strong> must be scheduled on a date and time that is agreed upon mutually. We want to be in a place where we can provide the best sound possible for you, and we want to make sure you have everyone there that you’d hoped. Must be redeemed within 12 months. </p>
<p><strong>7. Your producer credit</strong> will appear in the liner notes of the physical copy (CD or download card) after the album is released. We will be in touch with you to make sure you have exactly what you want written in there. This is YOUR big moment! </p>
<p>8. We love to take a stab at playing songs across all genres, however the <strong>recorded song</strong> must be a cover song with published lyrics and must be approved by Branden and James. Not every artist can pull of any type of song, and we’re no exception to that rule. </p>
<p><strong>9. The Painted Cello</strong> is something that we have committed to hand deliver to you in your city. The mini cellos are approximately 30 inches long (for comparison James’ full-sized cello is 48 inches long) and will come with a stand so it can be showcased as a piece of art. This is only redeemable in the continental United States, Mexico, Australia and some larger cities in Canada. Since Mexico, Canada and Australia are a bit of a trek for us, they will be delivered in the window that we are there performing our shows. For example, if we’re in Aus. for three weeks in 2019, that’s when the painted cello will travel with us. We’ll be in communication with you month in advance to ensure we’re in town at the same time. We will cover our own travel and accommodation costs for the delivery of the cello.</p>
<p><strong>10. Superfandom</strong> is the gift that keeps on giving! But please be aware, the deliverables are subject to potential management release requirements and again, the postal service.</p>
<p><strong>11. A House Concert </strong>will be a huge effort on all of our parts and must be redeemed at a mutually agreed date and time and within 24 months of purchase. As we mentioned earlier, the purchaser must have access to a piano or full-sized electronic keyboard with weighted keys. If renting one for the evening, the purchaser is responsible for all costs associated with such rental. If the house concert is held outdoors, specific sound equipment must be utilized in order for us to provide the best sound possible for you. This equipment must be rented by the purchaser who will accept full responsibility of the costs of such rental.  The repertoire for the house concert will be decided by Branden &amp; James, but we will happily prepare a couple of reasonable requests for the event. Branden &amp; James will provide their personal travel and accommodation costs surrounding the date of the house concert. They will be unable to fly in any earlier than one day before the concert and must leave after the house concert is finished if their schedule requires such. Please see clause number 10 for Superfandom rules. </p>
<p><strong>12. The Dinner Party</strong> and House Concert date must be redeemed at a mutually agreed upon date and time and within 24 months of purchase. Dinner party and house concert must take place on the same day or evening. Same requirements listed above in clause 11 for the house concert apply. For the dinner party portion, Branden and James will organize a menu to accommodate everyone’s dietary restrictions. We request that dinner be served and eaten before the house concert begins in order to give us a little bit of time to prepare for the concert. Branden &amp; James will provide their personal travel and accommodation costs surrounding the date of the house concert and dinner party. They will be unable to fly in any earlier than one day before the concert and must leave after the house concert and dinner party is finished if their schedule requires such. Please see clause number 10 for Superfandom rules. </p>

For example, if we’re in Aus. for three weeks in 2019, that’s when the painted cello will travel with us. We’ll be in communication with you month in advance to ensure we’re in town at the same time. We will cover our own travel and accommodation costs for the delivery of the cello.
10. Superfandom is the gift that keeps on giving! But please be aware, the deliverables are subject to potential management release requirements and again, the postal service.
11. A House Concert will be a huge effort on all of our parts and must be redeemed at a mutually agreed date and time and within 24 months of purchase. As we mentioned earlier, the purchaser must have access to a piano or full-sized electronic keyboard with weighted keys. If renting one for the evening, the purchaser is responsible for all costs associated with such rental. If the house concert is held outdoors, specific sound equipment must be utilized in order for us to provide the best sound possible for you. This equipment must be rented by the purchaser who will accept full responsibility of the costs of such rental.  The repertoire for the house concert will be decided by Branden & James, but we will happily prepare a couple of reasonable requests for the event. Branden & James will provide their personal travel and accommodation costs surrounding the date of the house concert. They will be unable to fly in any earlier than one day before the concert and must leave after the house concert is finished if their schedule requires such. Please see clause number 10 for Superfandom rules. 
12. The Dinner Party and House Concert date must be redeemed at a mutually agreed upon date and time and within 24 months of purchase. Dinner party and house concert must take place on the same day or evening. Same requirements listed above in clause 11 for the house concert apply. For the dinner party portion, Branden and James will organize a menu to accommodate everyone’s dietary restrictions. We request that dinner be served and eaten before the house concert begins in order to give us a little bit of time to prepare for the concert. Branden & James will provide their personal travel and accommodation costs surrounding the date of the house concert and dinner party. They will be unable to fly in any earlier than one day before the concert and must leave after the house concert and dinner party is finished if their schedule requires such. Please see clause number 10 for Superfandom rules.",1.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who am I</h3>
<p>I've been a lot of things in my life, father, sailor, carpenter, but through it all, musician has been the title that has colored all the rest.  This album is opening doors for me to explore the singer songwriter in me to the fullest extent, and to bring the music, the songs and stories, front row seats and behind the scenes peeks, to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I'm Here</h3>
<p>To make the best album possible in a professional studio with the caliber of talent I have chosen, takes a great deal of time and energy, as well as financial resources.  I expect the final cost to be about $12,000.  I have already spent over $6000 and the recording is nearing completion.  There will still be mixing, mastering, photography, graphic design, marketing and manufacturing costs.  This is where your help will make the rest of this project an overwhelming joy and a big success.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I'd like you to come along</h3>
<p>Songwriters can have a lot of fun digging into their insides and extracting some of the more profound and bizarre ideas and visions that show up there,  and then fashioning them into songs. Putting an album together to perfect all the musical pieces and wrap them up in an alluring package is the icing on the cake.  It's the thing they can hold up say, see, I've accomplished this!  But the true reward of a singer songwriter is to play for you!</p>
<p>I want to play my songs for you and I hope you will like them and want to hear more.  Without you, I'm just singing to the walls and ceilings. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>I'm giving you a few ways to get involved and show your support for me, and independent musicians everywhere. When you decide to come aboard and help in some way, you become part of my clan, my musical familia.  This means you get to hear and see songs and videos that others cannot.  You come behind the scenes with me to get an intimate look at what it takes to make all this happen. </p>
<p>You can simply decide to contribute any amount you wish, but why not get a little something for your contribution.  Check out the offers of Cds, Albums, Books and Concerts listed on this page.</p>
<p>  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Since so much music can be had for free these days, it's begun to seem silly to pay money to be able to listen to music. You may choose not to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  It would be great if you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the word about this Album with your friends and social media contacts</li>
<li>Come to a show, bring friends and enjoy the music with me</li>
<li>Suggest a location for a show, or ask me about booking a house concert</li>
<li>Are you, or do you know someone that works at a newspaper, radio or TV station, that might benefit by hearing about this music and help spread the word.</li>
<li>Look up my album, ""Almost Home"" on Spotify.  Like it and share it around.  Or even better, put a song or two into one of your playlists and share that.  These little things can go a long way and are very much appreciated.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>I hope you are inspired to come along.  It may feel like taking a chance, but there really is no down side.  Your interest in my music is the reward that keeps me going, so I am good with anything you are able to contribute toward getting this music spread around.  It's from my heart to your ears.</p><p>Enjoy</p><p>Peace</p><p>Jim </p></div>","Who am I

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! My name is Patrick. I perform under the name of Blooming and I'm independent singer-songwriter trying to make a difference in the world with my music.</p>
<p>I write, record and perform music because I choose every day to bring light, joy, love and magic into people's lives. That's why I wake up every day. This world can be a very dark place and I want to be someone who uses their music to help people come back into their power and connect with the joy of living. My work is in service of helping people choose how they'd love to experience life. Everything I do in my life is in service of that.<br/><br/>I'm reaching out to you because I need your help! After more than a year spent writing, planning and creating, I have a collection of songs that are <strong>READY for Recording</strong>. It's exciting, a little daunting but more than anything immensely satisfying to write this. <br/>I say this because these songs have already brought so much joy and connection to people when they've been performed. AND-<br/>Now these 5 songs are finally ready to make their way into the world!<br/><br/><strong>This is where you come in.</strong> When I recorded my last EP, I crowdfunded $2500 having no idea how much a recording project like this would cost. It was an amazing achievement and I'm still immensely grateful to everyone who supported me. <br/>BUT- I didn't ask for the financial assistance I actually needed for the project. I forked out an additional $4500 to cover the rest rest of the expenses... On a musician's salary.<br/>I'm proud of the results, but by the end of the whole process I was burnt out, broke and for a while ended up withdrawing completely from pursuing a career in music <strong>(The thing I'm here to do).</strong></p>
<p>The momentum I had came to a stumbling halt because I didn't ask for the help I truly needed.</p>
<p>Now I'm back to doing what I love and sharing music from my heart and I want to do this on a wide-spread level. These songs have the capacity to help me do just that.</p>
<p>I want this EP to be collaborative. I want us as a collective to put this thing together. I'm bringing in more and more participation with these songs and having you donate is a massive part of that project. I can say that WE as a collective brought a vision into reality.<br/> </p>

It's a call to love and embrace it, or at least CHOOSE how we want to experience it. By facing the city as it is, in it's entirety we can collectively consider and engage in creating the city we'd love to live in.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The most difficult thing in producing this EP is reaching out and asking for your help. My tendency to try to do things entirely on my own has made things much harder than they need to be. I already feel like I'm asking a lot, but I'm honestly trying to lay down what the actual costs are for this project to release this music at the standard it deserves. Following that, the biggest challenge I perceive is raising the money needed to make this EP happen. <br/> </p>

<p>My name is Taunya Kay and I am doing this for my daughter
Halle.  She is a Junior at Box Elder High School and since she was little
she has always loved taking pictures.  I have always tried to encourage
anything that my girls show a passion for.  I have been a single mother to
2 wonderful girls for the past 14 years.  I have never been the type of
person to ask for help in any way, but last year was a rough year for us. 
I am swallowing my pride and putting this out there because she is such a good
kid and her face just lights up when she talks about the trip her school has
offered.<br/><br/>
She has the opportunity to go to New York City with her Fashion Merchandising
class through Bridgerland Applied Technology College.  She is so excited
because before she heard about the trip she was already looking at a college in
New York.  The School of Visual Arts offers exactly what she wants.<br/>
The only problem is Halle had 2 concussions while she was a cheerleader. 
After the 2nd she developed social anxiety, therefore we don't know if she will
be able to handle New York.  This trip gives her the perfect opportunity
to experience life there for 5 days &amp; 4 nights with people she is familiar
with. Hopefully this will build her confidence and help her realize her dream
of being a professional fashion photographer. <br/>
The trip will cost $1350 which includes <u>everything</u> except food.<br/>
She will get to attend 2 Broadway shows, visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
the FIT-view exhibit, take a Waterway cruise around Manhattan and the Statue of
Liberty, visit Greenwich Village, SOHO, Little Italy, Chinatown, the World
Trade Center Memorial and St Paul's Chapel, Take a walking tour of Fifth
Avenue, Rockefeller Center and Central Park, and the most exciting for her is
the 2 Professional Fashion Workshops because one will be a Photo Shoot with Lee
Clower.<br/>

asking for the entire amount.</p>Please check out the perks we have available.<br/>Please help to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.<br/>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!<p></p><p><br/></p></div>","My name is Taunya Kay and I am doing this for my daughter

<h3>The Red Tack's new record, 'Judy'.</h3>
<p>Two years ago, I released my first solo record, '<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/0TaEg04zHgNpx23H2bAcsX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(K)Night of the Sorrowful Face</a>', to critical acclaim and much adoration from my small but strong circle of friends, family and fans.  The record was successfully funded here on this platform by an amazing group of supporters. I have finally gathered the courage to do it again, and I hope we can be as successful as we were the first time around, perhaps even more so! </p>
<ul>
<li>Some of you may already know me, but if you don't, I'm Colorado musician and long time guitarist/songwriter, <a href=""https://www.westword.com/music/teds-excellent-adventure-5058932"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ted Thacker</a>. I've named my solo act, <a href=""https://www.dailycamera.com/2017/09/13/hear-it-here-knight-of-the-sorrowful-face-by-the-red-tack/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Red Tack</strong></a> (yes, an anagram). This year, I've decided to add some great musicians to the thing for good measure, and I started in the studio.</li>
<li>Ex-<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/54954041625/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Baldo Rex</strong></a> drummers <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/blindrunnerband/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Call</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/dave.willey.167"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dave Willey</a>, two of Colorado's best drummers and musicians, have both joined me in the studio to create some real magic on a handful of songs. John plays his thundering rhythms on the anthemic Satellites, and Dave adds his rhythmic ballet to two brand new songs that I've never even played live yet. I also have the local legendary drum wizard, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/jeffmincemusic/about/?tab=page_info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeffrey Mince</a>, once <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPxpnJl5FGY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nina Hagen</a></strong>'s tour drummer, playing on some of the album's coolest songs. I have a new addition to my band, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/billy.pigati"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Billy Pigati</a>, a force majeure of songwriting prowess himself, he came just in the nick of time, and we will record two of the albums hits to be. There is also a blazing trumpet solo by longtime boulder musician extraordinaire, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100015268203420"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grant Rieder</a> on the title track. You'll have to wait to hear that one!</li>
<li>I also have big dreams and have set my sights high for the musicians joining me for the recording of the rest of the record. <strong><a href=""https://www.devotchka.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Devotchka</a>'s</strong> Tom Hagerman and Shawn King have both agreed to lend some magic, as has <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cedric.lemoyne.3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cedric Lemoyne</a>, an old family friend who just happens to play bass for <strong><a href=""https://alanis.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alanis Morrisette</a>, </strong>and the amazing and beautiful, <strong><a href=""https://www.roseofthewest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rose of the West</a></strong>. It's not enough to say that these folks would definitely bring the magic level of this record up to eleven.   </li>
<li>I have been, and will be, recording and mixing the majority of this record in my own house and in the excellent, millenium falcon of a studio that I recorded the last record in. This studio belongs to another amazing Denver legend, musician and engineer, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kyle.r.jones1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kyle Richard Jones</a>. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>I've recorded the majority of the album already, this is just the last push to get it finished.</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/yes-the-answer-to-the-universe-really-is-42-1351201.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">42</a> is the magic number, it's the meaning of the universe. But I only need a tad more than that. I will be able to pull off some feats of creation with $5200 for the final mixes, the mastering and the pressing and production of the vinyl record. Of course, if we can surpass that number I'll be able to reach out even further into the world with my music. With your help, this can be a big thing, maybe?</li>
<li>Along with becoming part of a great group of supporters, each and every donor will get some really amazing stuff from me that can't be had anywhere else. All second tier and above donors will receive a CD copy of my old powerhouse band, <strong><a href=""https://www.westword.com/music/veronica-5110727"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Veronica</a></strong>, <a href=""https://veronica.bandcamp.com/album/emerging-from-troubled-days"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emerging From Troubled Days</a>, a local DIY punk/rock scorcher I made in my basement with the amazing musicians, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/firstimersbanddenver/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrew Koch</a> and John Call. </li>
<li>For the first time, I'm offering t-shirts, courtesy of a sweet screen that my good friend and local artist and musician, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sunhousehill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Morgan Hill</a> made for me. These shirts will be as DIY as you can get and you will be able to choose your own custom color and size, and I can even print something on your own, one of a kind shirt from a thrift store (not kidding, if you want it on an old western shirt or a dishrag you use, as long as it prints, I can make it).</li>
<li>I have also enlisted the impeccable talents of Denver's beloved illustrator <a href=""http://karlchristiankrumpholz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Karl Christian Krumpholz</a>. His art can be seen all over Denver, on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ColfaxAvenue/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Colfax</a> avenue street signs and every week in the <a href=""https://www.westword.com/music/bud-bronson-and-the-good-timer-in-the-denver-bootleg-11630005"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Westword</a>. He has done the cover for 'Judy', and we will be printing a very limited number of signed copies of the original. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Red Tack 'Judy' will be one of your favorite albums of next summer!</h3>
<p>This release will only be available in the physical world on colored vinyl. As my last record was, this will be a surprise color for everyone. It will, of course, be available upon release, across your favorite platforms, but to make the deal meaningful for the low end bids, I will be sending out both demo and final mixes to pledgers right as they come from the studio. This will be weeks before they hit the airwaves and digital platforms. Everyone will also be receiving a copy of Veronica's last CD, 'Emerging From Troubled Days'. It's an excellent record in it's own right and should get your car party started every time you play it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We did it once, why can't we do it again?!</h3>

</div></div>","The Red Tack's new record, 'Judy'.
Two years ago, I released my first solo record, '(K)Night of the Sorrowful Face', to critical acclaim and much adoration from my small but strong circle of friends, family and fans.  The record was successfully funded here on this platform by an amazing group of supporters. I have finally gathered the courage to do it again, and I hope we can be as successful as we were the first time around, perhaps even more so! 

Some of you may already know me, but if you don't, I'm Colorado musician and long time guitarist/songwriter, Ted Thacker. I've named my solo act, The Red Tack (yes, an anagram). This year, I've decided to add some great musicians to the thing for good measure, and I started in the studio.
Ex-Baldo Rex drummers John Call and Dave Willey, two of Colorado's best drummers and musicians, have both joined me in the studio to create some real magic on a handful of songs. John plays his thundering rhythms on the anthemic Satellites, and Dave adds his rhythmic ballet to two brand new songs that I've never even played live yet. I also have the local legendary drum wizard, Jeffrey Mince, once Nina Hagen's tour drummer, playing on some of the album's coolest songs. I have a new addition to my band, Billy Pigati, a force majeure of songwriting prowess himself, he came just in the nick of time, and we will record two of the albums hits to be. There is also a blazing trumpet solo by longtime boulder musician extraordinaire, Grant Rieder on the title track. You'll have to wait to hear that one!
I also have big dreams and have set my sights high for the musicians joining me for the recording of the rest of the record. Devotchka's Tom Hagerman and Shawn King have both agreed to lend some magic, as has Cedric Lemoyne, an old family friend who just happens to play bass for Alanis Morrisette, and the amazing and beautiful, Rose of the West. It's not enough to say that these folks would definitely bring the magic level of this record up to eleven.   
I have been, and will be, recording and mixing the majority of this record in my own house and in the excellent, millenium falcon of a studio that I recorded the last record in. This studio belongs to another amazing Denver legend, musician and engineer, Kyle Richard Jones. 


I've recorded the majority of the album already, this is just the last push to get it finished.


42 is the magic number, it's the meaning of the universe. But I only need a tad more than that. I will be able to pull off some feats of creation with $5200 for the final mixes, the mastering and the pressing and production of the vinyl record. Of course, if we can surpass that number I'll be able to reach out even further into the world with my music. With your help, this can be a big thing, maybe?
Along with becoming part of a great group of supporters, each and every donor will get some really amazing stuff from me that can't be had anywhere else. All second tier and above donors will receive a CD copy of my old powerhouse band, Veronica, Emerging From Troubled Days, a local DIY punk/rock scorcher I made in my basement with the amazing musicians, Andrew Koch and John Call. 
For the first time, I'm offering t-shirts, courtesy of a sweet screen that my good friend and local artist and musician, Morgan Hill made for me. These shirts will be as DIY as you can get and you will be able to choose your own custom color and size, and I can even print something on your own, one of a kind shirt from a thrift store (not kidding, if you want it on an old western shirt or a dishrag you use, as long as it prints, I can make it).
I have also enlisted the impeccable talents of Denver's beloved illustrator Karl Christian Krumpholz. His art can be seen all over Denver, on Colfax avenue street signs and every week in the Westword. He has done the cover for 'Judy', and we will be printing a very limited number of signed copies of the original. 


The Red Tack 'Judy' will be one of your favorite albums of next summer!
This release will only be available in the physical world on colored vinyl. As my last record was, this will be a surprise color for everyone. It will, of course, be available upon release, across your favorite platforms, but to make the deal meaningful for the low end bids, I will be sending out both demo and final mixes to pledgers right as they come from the studio. This will be weeks before they hit the airwaves and digital platforms. Everyone will also be receiving a copy of Veronica's last CD, 'Emerging From Troubled Days'. It's an excellent record in it's own right and should get your car party started every time you play it. 

We did it once, why can't we do it again?!
We've done this before, and it was both really fun and everyone loved the end product. 

My recording chops have only gotten better through the process, and I'm excited to make this record pop with more fun sounds and musical treats for the ear. 
Yes, it's going to be a challenge, but I'm excited to tackle it.

<p><u><i><strong>**ENGLISH VERSION BELOW**</strong></i></u></p>
<p><b>¿QUIÉN SOY?</b></p>
<p>Hola! Mi nombre es Claudia Avila, tengo 34 años y soy músico profesional: cantante, pianista y directora coral. Hice mi pregrado en la Universidad de los Andes (piano y dirección coral) con grandes maestros, y luego me fuí a Suiza a perseguir un sueño que tenía desde que tengo memoria: estudiar canto. Allí, en Basilea, encontré mi voz a través de la música barroca y clásica; una voz potente, que tenía mucho por decir. Paralelo a esto, tuve la gran fortuna de trabajar haciendo conciertos de música folclórica latinoamericana de la mano de mi gran amiga Vittoria Pagani en la guitarra. Junto a ella, y con el gran apoyo de la Dra. Yvette Sánchez, directora del Departamento de estudios latinoamericanos de la Universidad de St. gallen (Suiza), pude reconectar con mis raíces y enriquecer mi corazón y mi voz. Y al regresar a Colombia en el año 2015, exploré de la mano de talentosos colegas cantantes la forma de interpretar la música popular, y el fuego que siento al cantarla siguió creciendo. </p>
<p>Hace poco más de dos años, en un taller de liderazgo declaré ser la mejor cantante de Colombia y, por fin, después de mucho aplazarlo, a mediados de 2018 tomé acción y comencé a hacer un disco que fuera fiel reflejo de quién soy y de qué quiero decir. Es un sueño que, realmente, lleva en mi desde siempre: llegar con la música y con el canto a todo el mundo; expresar lo que mi corazón siente y conectarme con todo aquel que me escuche. Contar mis historias, las historias de otros, las historias de todos como seres humanos que sentimos, vivimos, lloramos, amamos intensamente y reímos desde el alma. Seres humanos con una misión. </p>
<p>He descubierto el poder que tiene la música, y lo que genera en mí el cantar: el sentirme viva cada vez que me paro en un escenario a hacerlo. Y esa vida es lo que me impulsa a escribir, componer, arreglar y dejar este disco como testimonio de este sentir. Es por esta razón por la que, después de haber vivido fuera de mi país por tanto tiempo y explorado en tantos géneros de la música, he decidido darle rienda suelta a uno de mis más grandes sueños: consolidar mi primera producción como solista, incursionando de lleno en el género de la música popular. </p>
<p>Amo el jazz, y siempre me ha causado curiosidad cómo este género se fusiona con otros, y permite explorar la improvisación sobre bases rítmicas diversas. Y las composiciones que encontrarás en este disco tienen como elemento en común el trío de jazz (piano, bajo, batería), acompañado por otros instrumentos pertenecientes a la música folclórica sudamericana. Y de la mano de mi gran amigo, el maestro David Zuluaga, llevamos esta fusión a otro nivel, al integrar elementos electrónicos en los arreglos. Esto le da un toque único y un color hermoso a mi música. </p>
<p>Me encantaría poder tener este disco en mis manos y compartirlo con el mundo, y para ello requiero de tu apoyo económico y de tu contribución. Este aporte hará que mi sueño se haga realidad  y así poder seguir aportando al arte y a la música de mi país; podré llevar mis canciones al mundo entero y compartir con todos ustedes lo que siento cuando canto. La felicidad de hacer lo que siempre he amado hacer. </p>

My name is Nate Engberg. I am passionate about spreading the gospel and encouraging the church through music, and that's what my upcoming album, <i>Steadfast</i>, is all about.</p>
<p>I began writing songs for the church in high school, not knowing at the time that my passion would lead to the production of my first album ten years later. Looking back, I can say that this collection of songs is representative of my spiritual growth into who I am today. Ultimately every song points back to where it all started: the desire to serve God and encourage the church.</p>
<p>After high school, I attended Northwest Nazarene University for three years to pursue a degree in music. By the time I graduated, I had a dream of becoming a Christian recording artist. Now it is finally time to make that dream a reality. </p>

It is a call to Christians to stand firm for Jesus in a world that is doing its best to defame His name. As a Christian songwriter, I have two goals that I endeavor to meet in all of my music: the first is to provoke thought about the gospel, and the second is to encourage the church through theologically sound, Bible-based lyrics.</p>
<p>I have selected the best of my songs for this album, and I believe that each song has the potential to speak into your life. This music can also be used as a tool to share your faith with others because every song alludes to the greatness of God's saving grace, and I hope it will spark many conversations about salvation. </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>I am launching this campaign because I know I can't do this project alone. I believe that any attempt to minister to the needs of the world and the church requires the blessing of God and the support of His people. With your help, we can have an impact on people's lives and spread a little more light in a dark world.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! My name is Nate Engberg. I am passionate about spreading the gospel and encouraging the church through music, and that's what my upcoming album, Steadfast, is all about.
I began writing songs for the church in high school, not knowing at the time that my passion would lead to the production of my first album ten years later. Looking back, I can say that this collection of songs is representative of my spiritual growth into who I am today. Ultimately every song points back to where it all started: the desire to serve God and encourage the church.
After high school, I attended Northwest Nazarene University for three years to pursue a degree in music. By the time I graduated, I had a dream of becoming a Christian recording artist. Now it is finally time to make that dream a reality. 

 
Music for the Church
""Steadfast"" is both the name of my first single and the complete album because that one word describes the theme of the album as a whole. It is a call to Christians to stand firm for Jesus in a world that is doing its best to defame His name. As a Christian songwriter, I have two goals that I endeavor to meet in all of my music: the first is to provoke thought about the gospel, and the second is to encourage the church through theologically sound, Bible-based lyrics.
I have selected the best of my songs for this album, and I believe that each song has the potential to speak into your life. This music can also be used as a tool to share your faith with others because every song alludes to the greatness of God's saving grace, and I hope it will spark many conversations about salvation. 
Why Indiegogo?
I am launching this campaign because I know I can't do this project alone. I believe that any attempt to minister to the needs of the world and the church requires the blessing of God and the support of His people.

<h2>Unravelling the journey:</h2>
<p>In 2015, I embarked on a project to complete my first album, <i>Lines</i>. It was a labour of love, having done almost every part of it myself, from the mixing to the album art. I never commercially released it, instead burning only 50 copies to disc from my own computer, and selling it to my loved ones, and to interested people who saw me perform at events and open mic nights. <i>Lines</i> taught me a lot, and paved the way for my current project, <i>Unravel Me</i>. As a transgender person assigned female at birth, my voice has been a point of great uncertainty in my life. On one hand, I grew up with my voice sounding a certain way, and I loved that voice in many ways. I knew its bounds, I knew how to make to do what I needed it to do. I live with schizophrenia, and music has always been my main creative and emotional outlet. The idea of taking hormones and changing my voice was a terrifying prospect, even though my original voice sounded like it didn't belong to me. When I recorded <i>Lines</i>, I immortalized that voice on an album, along with all the sadness that came with my earlier years. <i>Lines</i> gave me permission to move into a place of excitement and hope for the future. On March 21st, 2018, I began hormone therapy, and on April 5th, 2018, I went back into the studio, this time with a professional audio engineer, and we recorded the first song of Unravel Me. Since then, we recorded 13 tracks, completing the album incrementally over a space of 18 months.</p>
<p>The main goal of my music has always been about relating to people, reaching people with a message of hope and resilience.<i> Unravel Me</i> is bursting at the seams with hope. It details a transformative journey from darkness into a place of light and lightness. This album is inspired by the image of the chrysalis. The caterpillar spins its chrysalis, without knowing it will come completely undone, and emerge as something so ornate and beautiful and new. That, to me, is such an incredible mystery of faith and hope in the unknown. Like the caterpillar, I have taken a proverbial leap of faith, not knowing how my voice will emerge, but hopeful that it will be something that is ever more beautiful in its connection to - and reflection of - who I am. <i>Unravel Me</i> is the documentation of this process of coming undone. <i>Unravel Me </i>is my time in the chrysalis.</p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>As a trans person, I have spent a lot of time reflecting about how little positive representation we get. I've met many trans people, but even when I started considering hormone therapy, no one could say for certain whether I'd be able to keep singing. There is no research readily available on the topic of trans men's voices. Many of the trans men I've met said they used to sing before hormone therapy, and don't sing anymore. Others sing, but less often, or less publicly. I need music like I need air, so I set out on this album journey, determined to never stop singing, and never stop singing passionately. I hope this album will be an example of what the journey of voice masculinization can be - an exciting, terrifying dive into becoming who we truly are.</p>
<p>Because of the unique nature of the project as a documentation of changes to my voice, the recording needed to begin at the start of the changes. Recording commenced April 5th, 2018, and has continued at intervals until September 23, 2019, eighteen months after I began hormone therapy, with the projected release date of April 26th, 2020, which happens to be my 30th birthday! Now that we've finished the recording stage, there is much to be done, and I need your help to make this album happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Breaking it down:</h3>
<p>I'm fundraising for $2500 to cover the costs of this very collaborative album. First, the cost of recording and mixing of the tracks by the fantastic audio engineer E. Morgan is $1000 even. The album art, created by an incredible Victoria-based artist, F. Leiken, is $500. These two costs are the bare minimum, and I firmly believe in paying artists a living wage, so if I raise more than I need, these two artists will receive a bonus. Next, I'll be using CDBaby for fulfillment and distribution. This price varies, but will likely be between $600 and $750, depending on how many folks order physical CDs. I'm also planning an album release party, and will need to rent a venue which is accessible to the public, including wheelchair accommodation, washrooms, a variety of seating, transit access, and food and beverages to meet different needs. My budget for the party is the lowest on my fundraising priority list, but a good album release party is important to me, still. Anything above the production costs of the album will be put toward this.</p>
<h3>What's in it for you:</h3>
<p>To make things more fun and interesting, I've created several perks for donations to the campaign. Ranging from the basic signed CD and commemorative merch, to homemade pie, to a personalized song, there's something pleasing for every price point. I've tried to keep everything personal and a little bit playful! Ultimately, I just want to spread the joy of music far and wide, and need some financial support to do that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways to be part of the impact:</h3>
<p>I know not everyone has the resources to contribute. I totally get that! If you believe in the power of music, and the power of sharing our journeys of transformation, then you can help by spreading the word. The farther this campaign reaches, and the more its message of hope and connection spreads, the better. Use those share tools, tell your friends and families and neighbours and complete strangers, if that pleases you. You'll be helping one little voice be as loud and proud as possible!</p>

<p><i>Tales from t'Dales</i> is the debut from native Yorkshire emcees Doberman &amp; Breathless; an album birthed from the disillusion of dead-end jobs, ambiguous romantic attachments, the weight of social expectation and the blinkered existence of bored young men in a small market town.<br/><br/><i>""A refreshing and honest example of Northern Hip Hop, we need more like this.""</i> <br/><i>- </i>Hip-Hop Kings<br/><br/><i>""The duo could become a central tenet of the northern hip hop scene.""</i><br/><i>- </i>UKHH.com<br/><br/>Ey up, I'm Doberman. Now that I've hyped the album up in third person and pinched some online criticisms of it to reassure the skeptics that it's not shit, I feel the time is right for me to tell you a bit about the project itself, how it came about, what it means to us, and why we're reaching out to you good people to get it made up in a physical format...<br/><br/> </p>
<h3><span><strong>""Who the f*ck are Doberman and Breathless?"" A bit of backstory</strong></span></h3>
<p>So, basically me and Breathless are two emcees from Irish Fields Collective, which is our ""crew"" if you like, consisting of:-<br/><br/>Doberman (me): Emcee<br/>Breathless: Emcee<br/>Glum: Emcee/Producer<br/>Bottom Lip: Producer/DJ<br/>Earl Swirl: Producer/8th Dan Wasteman<br/><br/>Essentially, we were all mates from school back in Yorkshire who have always been connected by our love of music in some way or another - whether that was moshing in someone's basement, touring the pubs of Otley as an Arctic Monkeys soundalike band, or embarking on underaged outings to Jungle nights in the arse end of Leeds.<br/><br/>From about the age of 17 onwards the sound that united us was UK Hip-Hop. Eventually, as I'm sure all lovers of hip-hop have done at some point, this love evolved into a habit of getting a bit wobbly on cheap booze, putting classic hip-hop instrumentals on, forming a circle and trying to insult each other (and each others' mums) through the medium of freestyle rap.<br/><br/>Eventually, me and Breathless started having our own cyphers on weeknights, when we weren't pissed, and where we brought along our own bars that we'd written beforehand. These were more serious bars, ones about our feelings and that, many of which would eventually form the foundations of some of our first rough tracks as a duo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Lost Mixtape</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, we started recording at DubWhy Studios with ExP (former Sinoptic Music label boss, founder of YouTube series <i>WYCypher</i>, and one third of Flame Griller), with serious ambitions to make an Irish Fields mixtape. <br/><br/>We recorded material for the best part of the year, occasionally dropping a low-hanging fruit of our labours on Soundcloud, but as fate would have it, we all moved for some reason or another. With myself in Birmingham, Breathless in Australia, Bottom Lip in Leeds, Earl SwirI in Worthing (I think...somewhere not too far from Brighton anyway) and Glum in South America, the project got parked, and has been sat on the shelf ever since.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""Yeah it's a nice story mate, maybe get to the point though...""</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Tales from t'Dales</i>, like the stillborn mixtape that preceded it, was a genuine labour of love. Thankfully, while the likelihood of getting five lads to finalise a project without being in the same room was looking bleak, me and Breathless kept working on new material, sending each other beats, bars and track concepts from opposite ends of the world.</p>
<p>When Breathless said he’d be back for a few weeks in the summer of 2017, I suggested we get back in the studio and do an EP. After using up all the holiday I could to get more recording time, the EP soon snowballed into an album: <i>Tales from t’Dales</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""Ah okay. So what you wanting money for again?""</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to commemorating the album's anniversary, by getting physicals of it made we hope to achieve two things:-<br/><br/>1) Thank those who have shown us love and support by giving them the opportunity to not only have a physical copy of it, but also to get their hands on some super-limited, extra dank, one-time-only merch.</p>
<p>2) Help word of Doberman, Breathless and the Irish Fields Collective spread further – we want a professionally packaged product that we can hand out to more publications, more radio stations, and more randoms after the open mic. <br/><br/>Getting there however, requires a bit of generosity, compassion, and some vocal support. That's where you come in, humble reader (you've read this far, so we already get the impression that you're dead nice).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""Alright, how much you after?""</h3>
<p>The initial plan is to raise a minimum of £300 for a run of 100 CDs printed in cardboard sleeves (a bit like the mockup image at the top of the page, only with artwork on the CD itself too). <br/><br/>For those who are interested in Tales from t'Dales merch but don't want a physical copy of the album, we've incorporated the markup of a CD into the manufacturing prices here, meaning that all pledges will effectively contribute to the initial run of 100.<br/><br/>Those choosing to invest in both the CD and some merch will enjoy their copy of the album at a discounted rate.<br/><br/>We've given ourselves 60 days to do this, not because we think it'll take that long to raise 300 quid, but because we want to raise the maximum amount of funds possible. We've set ourselves the initial £300 target because we think it's achievable, and because a run of 100 copies was the most reasonably priced deal we could find for a relatively small print run.<br/><br/>However, on the off chance we receive more funding than expected, we'd love to be able to spend any ""profits"" from the merch mark up on even more CDs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>""What you gonna do if you don't raise £300?""<br/> </h3>
<p>If this happens, the contributions that we do have will still go towards some CDs, and we will message individual pledgers to ensure that they still get what they've paid for - we'll just do our best to raise the remaining funds through some more old school fundraising methods - busking, getting in a bath of beans...whatever it takes, we'll get it done eventually.</p>

<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>The idea for Big Turnips came about in November 2016 in an unfinished basement in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. While we were lamenting that so many talented songwriters end up never preserving their songs on a high-quality, durable medium (read: vinyl), something clicked. Why couldn't we take up that lofty goal of saving beautiful songs before they're forgotten? Organizing, recording, mixing, mastering, and production would be a heck of a task, but since we had more time than money we set off on this adventure in earnest.</p>
<p>We thought of John and Alan Lomax traveling the world recording cultural tunes that reverberate through new minds today, broadening their concept of music and life. We thought of our hometown hero, Helen Creighton, who went all around Atlantic Canada in the 1930's recording local cultural music and interviews, capturing a part of our home that we would never have heard without her.</p>
<p>Sitting atop the shoulders of those three giants, we started something amazing.</p>
<p>Big Turnips Volume 1 is a collection of 15 songs by 11 artists recorded by Stephen McIntosh and produced by McIntosh and Dylan Jewers between January and October 2017 at the Halifax Central Library Media Studio. The songs and artists on this compilation come primarily from Atlantic Canada -- Nova Scotia in particular. Some are relatively new, while one tune, ""Harbour Grace,"" is the oldest English song from the Province of Newfoundland and is perhaps over 300 years old.</p>
<p>Some these songs are quintessentially Eastern Canadian. ""Black Rock Beach"" by Mama's Broke is a harrowing look back at the old days of public executions and witch hunts. ""Dino's Lament"" by Basil is a peek into the world of Gottingen Street, one of Halifax's most historic roads. And ""Scotia Stream"" by The Good Woods is a brief, modern shanty which tells the sad tale of a lonely Nova Scotian looking for love at the end of a Scotian gal's fishing line. </p>
<p>This is only the beginning. We're in the studio every week preserving as many languages, as many songwriters, as many bits of Atlantic Canada as we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Side A</p>
<p>1. Black Rock Beach--Mama's Broke</p>
<p>2. Spent Too Long in Bed--Young Men &amp; Odd Socks</p>
<p>3. Cost of a Friend--Dan St. Dan Band</p>
<p>4. On the Take--DG Mitchell</p>
<p>5. I Think My Radio's Broke--Mike T. Kerr</p>
<p>6. Harbour Grace (Newfoundland Traditional)-- Dylan Jewers</p>
<p>7. How long till I'm staring at the end?--Lukie Lovechild</p>
<p>8. Red Wine Winter--Bradshaw, Mitchell &amp; Long</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Side B</p>
<p>1. Scotia Stream--The Good Woods</p>
<p>2. Pacific Blues--Dan St. Dan Band</p>
<p>3. Fastball--Jesse Webber</p>
<p>4. Terrible Man--Odd Socks</p>
<p>5. I Ain't Sad &amp; Lonely No More (I'm Just Sad)--Mike T. Kerr</p>

<p>7. Dino's Lament--Basil</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $2000 to get this project to the vinyl press pronto. This, plus the money we've saved from performances, and showcases around Halifax, as well as merchandising, will give us enough to press 300 high quality vinyl albums from Train Records in Toronto.</p>
<p>For your contribution, not only do you get the eternal glow of helping important passion projects come to life, but you can get tonnes of cool stuff as perks as well! From your standard vinyl copy, to songbooks, digital material, autographed stuff, and loving embraces.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Big Turnips is dedicated to recording, preserving and promoting Folk music of all kinds centered around songwriters and songsters from Atlantic Canada. The project is very much inspired by Dartmouthian folklorist and archivist Helen Creighton who carried this preservation ideal at a time much before iPods or even recording devices smaller than a mid-size sedan. Technology has made these projects easier, which is why it is all the more important to commit the time and logistic energy to make this thing real.</p>
<p>Things change all the time, thats the lovely world we live in. It is that reality that pushes us to enjoy and respect these musical moments as they pass. And if they're undeniably amazing, once-in-a-lifetime moments, then it would be irresponsible to not preserve them for future listeners.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There have been multitudes of challenges, but we wont harp on those too much. The main obstacles center around the fact that we started from scratch with no plan or resources at our disposal. Recording so many artists, free of charge, and then completing the mountain of administrative bureaucracy and red tape tested our endurance. Our bright eyes have dimmed slightly, our bushy tails: flattened. Worth it. Worth it a hundred times over.</p>
<p>The major risk we see is that failing this project, we risk losing this music forever, and it'd be like these wonderful songs, these wonderful events, never happened.</p>

<h3>Hello everyone, we are Jericho Hill - a high energy rock outfit from Everett, WA! </h3>
<p>We got our feet wet in the Seattle scene in January of 2016- debuting our sound at a rad venue called The Highdive, in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. </p>
<p>Since then we have worked hard, played hard, and saved like to crazy to get ourselves into a position where can afford to record our tunes in our favorite studio, with our favorite audio engineer.  We are currently recording at Synergy Productions in Seattle with Sean Walker and Jason Shavey at the helm - and we can't stress this enough: its going to be epic!<br/><br/>The music written for this album represents bits and pieces of our collective stories. From loss of those dear to us, to lonely military deployments in dangerous places, to celebrating the ""family"" that we've grown with in our music scene - this album represents the best and worst times of our lives. We seek to share our art with the masses, and by completing this album in its entirety, we will exorcise the demons that helped fuel its creation - whilst sealing the jovial moments in digital perpetuity. </p>
<p>We invite anyone who can, to help us on the final leg of this journey.</p>
<p><br/>We have our release party scheduled for September 8th, 2018, at the very same place we got our start: The Highdive. What we need now is a little extra help covering  mastering and duplication expenses. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How much cheddar do we need, and who is eating it?</h3>
<p>What we are asking for is $2000. Here is the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>$420 to master the album. Mastering is a specialized bit of audio engineering used to help a tune achieve total audio creaminess, after we finished with the recording process. </li>
<li>$1580 to duplicate the album. This is the process of having physical copies of the album made to give to you guys, sell in stores, and at shows. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal - we will work with whatever donations we do receive and have less copies produced. If we receive funds in excess of our goal, we will use those funds to have additional albums and merchandise produced.</li>
<li>Additionally, Malcolm (vocals) has a special vow he's making:</li>
</ul>

<h3>About The Roger Wagner Chorale...</h3>
<p><i>In the years following WWII, under the four decade leadership of <strong>Roger Wagner</strong>, the Chorale became a symbol of goodwill ambassadorship, most notably through its tours to Japan and South Korea. As the progenitor of the <strong>Los Angeles Master Chorale</strong>, <strong>The Roger Wagner Chorale</strong> will forever be revered for its contribution to the history and culture of Los Angeles. </i></p>
<p><i>Today, the legacy is rejuvenated under the baton of his daughter <strong>Jeannine Wagner</strong>, founder of the <strong>Wagner Ensemble</strong>. Highlighted by the <strong>Roger Wagner</strong> signature choral style and top quality musicianship, the <strong>The Roger Wagner Chorale</strong> features Roger Wagner’s American and World folk song classics, along with contemporary and classical world music. </i></p>
<p><i><strong>The Roger Wagner Chorale Goodwill Tour 2017</strong> launches in Los Angeles with a free concert on November 18th @ 8pm, Brentwood Presbyterian Church, 12000 San Vicente Boulevard, Brentwood CA  before leaving for Japan and South Korea on November 23. The tour will include a benefit concert for the city of Koriyama, Fukushima that was devastated six years ago by a 9.0 earthquake, resulting in a 30 meter tsunami that claimed the lives of more than 16,000 people.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The benefit...</h3>
<p><i><strong>The Roger Wagner Choral Institute</strong> is working to expand visibility by continuing to showcase its long-standing musicians as well as emerging artists, and promote new works of local, national, and international arrangers and composers, reflecting our diverse voice through music. The Institute also plans to provide in-house training in vocal production and conducting in the Wagner style, educational outreach, and benefit partnerships.</i></p>
<h3><strong>Your tax-deductible contribution...​</strong></h3>

</div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","About The Roger Wagner Chorale...
In the years following WWII, under the four decade leadership of Roger Wagner, the Chorale became a symbol of goodwill ambassadorship, most notably through its tours to Japan and South Korea. As the progenitor of the Los Angeles Master Chorale, The Roger Wagner Chorale will forever be revered for its contribution to the history and culture of Los Angeles. 
Today, the legacy is rejuvenated under the baton of his daughter Jeannine Wagner, founder of the Wagner Ensemble. Highlighted by the Roger Wagner signature choral style and top quality musicianship, the The Roger Wagner Chorale features Roger Wagner’s American and World folk song classics, along with contemporary and classical world music. 
The Roger Wagner Chorale Goodwill Tour 2017 launches in Los Angeles with a free concert on November 18th @ 8pm, Brentwood Presbyterian Church, 12000 San Vicente Boulevard, Brentwood CA  before leaving for Japan and South Korea on November 23. The tour will include a benefit concert for the city of Koriyama, Fukushima that was devastated six years ago by a 9.0 earthquake, resulting in a 30 meter tsunami that claimed the lives of more than 16,000 people.

The benefit...
The Roger Wagner Choral Institute is working to expand visibility by continuing to showcase its long-standing musicians as well as emerging artists, and promote new works of local, national, and international arrangers and composers, reflecting our diverse voice through music. The Institute also plans to provide in-house training in vocal production and conducting in the Wagner style, educational outreach, and benefit partnerships.
Your tax-deductible contribution...​
In the recent past, members of the Chorale have self-funded a good portion of the expenses of the concerts, tours, and outreach programs, donating their talent and materials. Now we are asking for your support to help cover some of those expenses, but if we don't meet our funding goal, we will still be able to cover a portion of those expenses thanks to you!

This process will take about 4 months and will require us to travel to Los Angeles, CA in April for recording sessions. This is a very exciting opportunity for Megan, but it is certainly not free or inexpensive. In return for his fee, this music producer will co-write 4 songs with Megan, help develop a fan base, record the 4 songs to CD and shop record labels to try and get her a signed deal.</p>

<p>We’re Teen Girl Scientist Monthly.  We’re a 6-piece, DIY indie-stomp band hailing from the sunny Brooklyn hamlet of Bed-Stuy.  Hello!  (That’s how they say “hello” where we’re from.)  We sound like Ra Ra Riot and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah making out in the bathroom at a party.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, we’ve jangled, stomped and shouted all about New York City, toured to SxSW, and made two EPs of sunny guitar pop.  Now we’re getting ready to release our debut album!  The erotic elation coursing through our toned and supple bodies cannot be described.  At least not any better than we just did.</p>
<p>The songs we’re recording are the product of two years of rattling windows at house shows and starting shout-a-longs at bars.  They’re the document of our love affair with playing live, loud music for people who love yelling and dancing and jumping against one another.  We’ve been incredibly blessed by amazing fans and open ears, and we’re stoked beyond super soakers to begin putting together this collection of our work.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 – by donating even a small amount you’ll be helping us rent studio time, pay our production staff, purchase the supplies for 500 albums and distribute them. </p>
<p>(None of this money, it should be noted, will go towards evil.  We have given that up, we swear.  It will instead go towards recording, mixing, mastering and releasing ten tracks of sugar-dipped shouters that buzz like burnt honey and bust like electric sex.  This is our (admittedly oddly phrased) promise to you.)</p>
<p>To say “thank you” (and “god, thank you so much [sob, sob]” and, also, “we’re nothing without you”), we’ve lined up some unique, awesome and unique gifts – autographed copies of the album, yoga with the band, a TGSM-themed Choose Your Own Adventure book, and more.  We’re so grateful for your help, and we want you to know that you’re a part of our crew – for $100, we’ll name drop you in our new song We Run With Gangs, and for $300 we’ll write and record a song for you, about you - or someone you like a whole bunch.  It will be a good song, and it will get you kisses. </p>
<p>If you’ve seen our live show or downloaded our EPs – and THANK YOU, if you have – you know that we’re committed to making the best recordings of our best material.  We’re excited to be making this album, and to be doing it with the support of our fans and friends (and moms, because they’re always worrying whether we’re eating enough.  YES MOM; WE JUST HAD AN APPLE LIKE TWO HOURS AGO.  GEEZ.). </p>
<p>Any little bit helps, and, if you feel so inclined, please tell your friends about our campaign and our music.  We love making new besties, and it gets the word out.  We couldn’t do this without you. </p>

<p><strong>Human Toys </strong>: Sexy, Powerful, Subversive.</p>
<p>Human Toys is a collision of electronic and raw rock’n roll sound.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Poupée (lead vocals, theremin) and Emma Amaretto (guitar, vocals, computer) like to play with female archetypes : subversion is the game and humor is the rule! Zeus Zelig (guitar, bass) joins as the guitar player for the US and Stephen Kida (drums) reinforces the digital beats with an evil voodoo touch.</p>
<p> The band’s music takes you in a hotrod, navigating the mad road through a musical landscape of subversive fantasy, oscillating between garage, punk, electro, grindhouse and giallo movies.  </p>
<p>Their powerful live performances are moments of pure energy, saturated with their wild and sensual enthusiasm.  </p>
<p>Whenever possible, original video projections accompany Human Toys’ performances. </p>
<p> Orignially created in 2006, Human Toys was a duo based in Paris. It is now a flexible unit as a duo or a trio based in Los Angeles and Marseille. </p>
<p> Stephen Kida, began his carreer in the 1979 west coast punk scene, playing with the legendary Dead Boys among other acts of noteriety.  He joined the band in 2011.  </p>
<p>Zeus Zelig comes from the californian garage punk underground, playing with The Loons as well as many other raw rock bands over the years.  He joined Human Toys in early 2012.</p>

<p><strong>About our campaign... </strong></p>
<p><em><br/></em>Our goal with this campaign is to raise some funds to allow us to put together an extra-ordinary packaging for this premiere LP by Human Toys. They have enlisted the artistic expertiese of Gilles Berquet (<a href=""http://www.gillesberquet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gillesberquet.com/</a>) and Lorenzo Eroticolor (<a href=""http://lorenzo-eroticolor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lorenzo-eroticolor.com/</a>) their amazing work deserves amazing packaging, so the more we raise, the more we can out into the quality and presentation of the record.

I wanted to be an entertainer and to perform for millions of people and use my gift from god to inspire future generations to get involved in music through singing. To let you all know out there singing is a passion of mine and I would do anything to make my dreams come true. This is so important to me and if I achieved this milestone in my life it will most definitely be the best thing that has ever happened to me. This will also change my life in so many ways so that I can help others who have the same dream as me to achieve theirs. This money that is contributed to my goal will go directly to my music production. (Studio time, beats) I will be recording 4 songs, and they will all be about love and inspiring people. So please help me make my dream a reality. Thank you so much God bless. -Tyrone :) Anything you give really counts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>About the project</strong></h3>
<p>Hello my names Matt and I’m a 20 year old musician from Penzance England who has stammered from a young age. I’m seeking funding to raise public awareness and understanding of stammering by making a charity album with artists and musicians (over 16) who stammer in aid of stammering.</p>

The album will also be sold online and all profits will be donated to a worthy stammering organisation. The idea for this project was formed when I was inspired by an article in the Cornishman newspaper about Kyle Coleman, a twenty five year old with autism who finds it hard to communicate with people other than through music, who was set to release a charity album in aid of autism. Having a severe stammer I have experienced social exclusion and know how difficult it can be to communicate. Like Kyle people who stammer find artistic expression is a way they are able to convey their thoughts and feelings without feeling restricted. With this in mind I felt I wanted to do something similar by recording and promoting a charity album with other people who stammer in aid of stammering. The album will feature 10 – 15 songs written by the artists and musicians themselves on the theme of stammering and will express the feelings and issues raised by the condition for people who stammer.</span></p>

<h3>Help raise awareness of stammering and get cool stuff in return!</h3>
<p>A contribution from you will really make a difference for people who stammer and will raise awareness of stammering.

<div>
<p>The album could have a hugely positive impact on people who stammer, building their confidence, allowing them to freely express their thoughts and feelings about stammering through songs on the album and also allowing them to meet other people who stammer at the recording studio and album launch gig to help them realise they're not alone.

<h2>Share the Music! Help MOBTOWNmoon's thrilling new version of Pink Floyd be heard the world 'round. </h2>
<h3>The CD is not available to the general public until May 7....BUT INSIDERS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT!</h3>
<p><em>A message from producers <a href=""http://sandyasirvatham.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The official Sandy Asirvatham website"">Sandy Asirvatham</a> and <a href=""http://ellencherry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The official ellen cherry website"">ellen cherry</a>.</em></p>
<p>A year ago it was still a dream....</p>
<p>And then, with the help of generous individual donors and a graciously well-timed foundation grant, we were able to produce our beautiful new version of Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. <em>Thank you again, dear friends and fans!</em></p>
<p><strong>The CD is done! You can listen to a few sound samples at</strong> <a href=""http://www.mobtownmoon.com/sounds.%C3%82"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mobtownmoon.com/sounds. </a></p>
<p>MOBTOWNmoon is both a celebration of one of the most beloved albums of all time and a showcase for Baltimore's tremendous musical talent. The project contains all sorts of fresh grooves, eclectic arrangements, and gorgeous sounds, from the expected (<em>rock guitar, synths, B3 organ swells</em>)....</p>
<p>to the surprising (<em>bassoon! accordion! strings! banjo!</em>)....</p>
<p>to the potentially mind-blowing (<em>Gregorian chant?! gospel piano?! and is that a cawing raven I hear?!</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Forty-two (42) Baltimore-based performers</strong> were involved in the recording. Now's the time to let the world know about the incredible talents we harbor here in Charm City....and you can help.</p>
<h3>We Know You Want It And You Want It Now</h3>
<p>If you pledged at the Eclipse Chasers level or higher during our first IndieGoGo campaign last summer, your CD is already en route to you.</p>
<p>But if not, why not get yourself a PRE-RELEASE COPY today and have it in your hands in about a week? It comes with a bonus: the warm, fuzzy feeling you get, knowing you are helping us broadcast this project far and wide.</p>

</div></div>","Share the Music! Help MOBTOWNmoon's thrilling new version of Pink Floyd be heard the world 'round. 
The CD is not available to the general public until May 7....BUT INSIDERS DON'T HAVE TO WAIT!
A message from producers Sandy Asirvatham and ellen cherry.
A year ago it was still a dream....
And then, with the help of generous individual donors and a graciously well-timed foundation grant, we were able to produce our beautiful new version of Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. Thank you again, dear friends and fans!
The CD is done! You can listen to a few sound samples at www.mobtownmoon.com/sounds. 
MOBTOWNmoon is both a celebration of one of the most beloved albums of all time and a showcase for Baltimore's tremendous musical talent. The project contains all sorts of fresh grooves, eclectic arrangements, and gorgeous sounds, from the expected (rock guitar, synths, B3 organ swells)....
to the surprising (bassoon! accordion! strings! banjo!)....
to the potentially mind-blowing (Gregorian chant?! gospel piano?! and is that a cawing raven I hear?!).
Forty-two (42) Baltimore-based performers were involved in the recording. Now's the time to let the world know about the incredible talents we harbor here in Charm City....and you can help.
We Know You Want It And You Want It Now
If you pledged at the Eclipse Chasers level or higher during our first IndieGoGo campaign last summer, your CD is already en route to you.
But if not, why not get yourself a PRE-RELEASE COPY today and have it in your hands in about a week? It comes with a bonus: the warm, fuzzy feeling you get, knowing you are helping us broadcast this project far and wide.
Again, you can hear some samples at www.mobtownmoon.com/sounds


Your Early Purchase Helps Us SHARE THE MUSIC

Press and radio campaigns require money up front (even when you're doing a large part of the work yourselves, as we are!). Your early purchase will help us get our CD out to as many influential DJs, music writers, and entertainment news editors as possible.
 
Choose one digital download, one physical CD, or a pack of five or ten if you're in the mood to be very, very sharing...

<p><span>For all members of the band, this project is something that's been in our minds for a long time. We talk about it after rehearsals, before shows, with friends and family. Whenever there's a period where the band is day-dreaming, a lot of our thoughts gravitate around that notion that, with a little help, we are going to be able to share what we do live for the audience, with everybody interested or intrigued about our music.</span></p>
<p><span>The donations will go a long way. We can get started on the recording of the album, and as that first, yet extremely important, part of the ""campaign"" concludes, then the distribution and promotion will start to take place.</span></p>
<p><span>When we are finished, our donators will receive the promises we are making here for them. Our dream will have come true, and from there, the sky is limit and you all are giving us wings.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>General Avocado - The Project and Contributions</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This project consists on 4 basic premises:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>The first portion of the contributions will go automatically to our ""Studio Time"", which will help us record and have the initial product ready for our fans.</span></li>
<li><span>Secondly, we will utilize another portion of the funds for merchandise, along with album distribution, to ensure everybody receives what we are promising in return for the donations.</span></li>
<li><span>We will constantly keep everybody posted on the advancement of the campaign with videos, and a few surprises, such as acoustic versions of our songs that everybody will get a chance to watch online.</span></li>
<li><span>The campaign will reach its ""destination"" once we have compiled all of the information necessary to deliver the product to our donators. We will record a video for the Album's first single, and the rewards will be shipped to our fans. We hope to be able to do this by Summer of 2013.</span></li>
</ol><p><span><strong>Important disclaimer:</strong> in the off-chance we are not able to achieve the full amount, we will do everything we can to still deliver our promises to those who donated, with the money collected from the campaign, and we will find new ways to reach that final goal. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>General Avocado - The Story</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This band started as a duo that added a drummer, who at the time was simply looking for a band that could open for his other band. As the rehearsals went on, and a solid foundation was built, General Avocado started playing little shows, everywhere and anywhere they could. With a few ""bucks"" collected from tips and the rare paid shows, they recorded about six songs in their living room, just to be able to give something tangible to whomever was interested in listening to a very humble ""snap-shot"" of what a live show was at that time. Finally, the last piece of the puzzle entered in the form of an extremely talented bassist who was able to connect with the band and the music immediately. With a full band now ""on stage"", General Avocado has evolved tremendously, and played at several different important local venues, at a larger scale, and continues to thrive on the emotions, and the true variety they bring to the local music scene, which is dominated to a certain point, by the heavy metal genre.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>One more thing...</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We consider what we are doing musically a very unique thing. It is really difficult for us to describe in in ""paper"", or with a few words. We do our best at that, and you can read it in our bio, but there is no better way to express it than to be able to play for you those songs that we have been working on for almost a year now. Please help us spread the music. There is no way to re-pay you for lending us a hand in achieving this dream of ours, but we promise you, we will do our very best. </span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is Kera's mom, Angela.  Kera has been playing viola for 5 years now.  This coming year she will be 16 and, unlike normal teenagers, she does not want a party or presents.  Instead she would like your assistance in upgrading her viola to a full size instrument from her beginner's viola. </p>
<p>Kera is already performing in the Honors Orchestra at Judson Highschool (the top orchestra in the school) and she is only in her sophomore year.  She loves to play and has about worn out her current viola...which is two sizes too small for her current stature.</p>
<p>For her Sweet 16, instead of a party and instead of gifts, she would like a GOOD QUALITY, full sized viola so that she can continue in her musical education.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is my hope that this will be viewed as a sponsorship towards Kera's 16th Birthday Gift.</p>
<p>What is needed:</p>
<p>Viola - Full Size 16"" Nicholas Ostler Tertis Viola $1,400.00</p>
<p>Bow - New bow  $100.00 +/-</p>
<p>Viola Case - Hard Case $150 -$200 (at least)</p>
<p>Strings - extra set of strings $50.00</p>
<p>Fees and taxes - $150 +/-</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will have the names of all sponsors engraved on a plaque for Kera to display.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal all of the items listed above will be able to be purchased...if we do not reach that goal then we will purchase what we can.</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal then all of the above will be purchased and and other monies will go towards getting a hard case for Kera's cello (yes, she plays two stringed instruments)...these cases start off at close to $400.00.  Anything beyond this will go directly to Kera as a bonus.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Family and friends are always important in a person's life.  With your support of Kera's musical passion you will make it possible for her to progress even further...having an instrument that is capable of sounding as good as you play makes a huge difference in propelling and ampliflying one's abilities.</p>
<p>Kera has been playing since 6th grade and is only growing in her love of orchestra.  In addition to playing viola and cello she also aspires to learn the contrabass.  She is very dedicated to the musical arts and continually strives to be ever improving in her ability, appreciation and devotion to playing.</p>
<p>Please be a part of making Kera's 16th birthday one that she will truly remember...not just with memories but a tangible instrument that will be with her throughout her musical journey.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that some of you will not be able to help and I understand completely.  If you could help get the word out to others that may be able to help I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Please share this campaign to help ensure Oyster (as she has named her desired instrument) becomes a part of Kera's life.</p>

Help me finish this puzzle I am working on. </h3></span></h3> <ul> <li>My name is Jeremy Dean Harrison and I am working on my second solo album, called, <i>How's the Whether?</i>
</li>
<li>The<i> album </i>is a reflection of the choices each individual has to make every day... a choice or a doubt between two or more alternatives, or when we say that something is true in any of the circumstances we mention. The music and lyrics are a reflection of the world around us and the difficulties in which we find ourselves making life choices in order to optimize and actualize our life experience. </li> <li>This campaign is important to me because I love sharing my music with others. I write songs to inspire people to be their best; because I feel inspired by the good in the world and I want to be the best me I can be; to actualize my potential and optimize my experience. I know this music can change a perspective or make a person's day better.</li> <li>With your help, I can complete this album and share my music for free with the world. </li>
<li>I believe in light and I believe in the choice to use that light for making this world amazing! </li> </ul> <p>After reading the Parable of the Talents, I was inspired to record my first album, Into the Light... A great man once said, ""“But with some I am not well pleased, for … they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. … Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.” At some point in time, we must all use our gifts and talents to inspire greatness in others! Fear not, for our talents are made in greatness. </p>

<h3>Thank you for giving me a chance to use my gifts and talents to share with the world! </h3>
<br/>
</div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","UPDATE: Watch this video for samples of music off the new album!

We are all part of a puzzle... and I am one of those puzzle pieces. You are all puzzle pieces as well. A puzzle is incomplete if even one piece is missing. Help me finish this puzzle I am working on.   My name is Jeremy Dean Harrison and I am working on my second solo album, called, How's the Whether?

The album is a reflection of the choices each individual has to make every day... a choice or a doubt between two or more alternatives, or when we say that something is true in any of the circumstances we mention. The music and lyrics are a reflection of the world around us and the difficulties in which we find ourselves making life choices in order to optimize and actualize our life experience.  This campaign is important to me because I love sharing my music with others. I write songs to inspire people to be their best; because I feel inspired by the good in the world and I want to be the best me I can be; to actualize my potential and optimize my experience. I know this music can change a perspective or make a person's day better. With your help, I can complete this album and share my music for free with the world. 
I believe in light and I believe in the choice to use that light for making this world amazing!   After reading the Parable of the Talents, I was inspired to record my first album, Into the Light... A great man once said, ""“But with some I am not well pleased, for … they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear of man. … Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.” At some point in time, we must all use our gifts and talents to inspire greatness in others! Fear not, for our talents are made in greatness. 
   What I Need 
Let me break it down:

$2,500 is the minimum I need. This provides me with 10 days in the studio, which is plenty of time to get things started.

Additional costs     


Drums... To put live drums on this album will cost me about $2,000 for studio and drummer (think Mars Volta or Afghan Whigs for studio drummer). 


Mix and Master... $2,500 will get this album an above and beyond mix from a professional. 


Website Updates... $500-1,000 


Print Cds $1,000 for 1,000 copies (I might do records this time as well)


Digital Distribution $150

≈$10,000.00 for everything!

I ask for a minimum of $2,500, but ideally I would like to surpass this goal so that I may have your help in completing the project sooner.
None of the money raised will be used to purchase airline tickets, hotel, cars or any other aspect of my personal life. I have a savings for that. 

As a PhD student studying Philosophy, with a part-time teaching salary, I could use a little extra help. My wife and I do all of our own graphics and videos... so that is fun for us.                                                                                                                           




 The Impact

If anything, do it for the kids... My students loved having a computer teacher who had his own cd. Most of them would sit down and do their work because they thought I was cool. Not all of them... but most of them. This music is impacting their future. ;)
I want you to be excited about this album. 

I know I am not famous but the music is really good... sincere and fun. Take a listen to my last album (http://www.jeremydeanharrison.com/music).

I have given away almost 1000 cds and have had a great number of people download the songs from my site. This was all paid for on my own but now I am hoping that someone will help me out. I am hoping you are that someone.

What You Get
First of all, I give you my love and appreciation. I have been working hard and saving up to record this second album; and by chipping in a few dollars, you realize my love for writing and recording music. There are no words or perks that can explain how I truly feel about others helping me to improve my gifts and talents to share with this world. 
Second, it takes a little while to complete an entire album, so it will be 6 months to a year before I have the finished product. It just takes time... and that means you are willing to invest in me... for that I owe you eternal and infinite gratitude. 



Other than that... check out the perks to see what you get... on my website there is some pretty cool merchandise I would like you to check out. If there is something that is on there, that you don't see in the perks... just hit me up and I will do my best to provide.

<p><i>In the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose statue keeps watch over OLS in the thriving city square we call home:</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""Music is the universal language of mankind.""</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>ONE LONGFELLOW SQUARE PROVIDES A TRULY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR PERFORMERS OF ALL GENRES AND AUDIENCES OF ALL AGES</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are not a crowded bar or a formal concert hall. We are a 200-seat neighborhood listening room in the culturally rich city of Portland, Maine. OLS is an intimate space where people of all walks of life come together and become part of the performance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">While we search out the finest national and international talent to bring to Maine, we also </span>support our vibrant local music scene<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, from the state's most established artists to young regional musicians at the beginning of their careers. Music legends like Tom Rush and Ronnie Earl return to our stage year after year, yet we are equally proud to have presented artists like The Punch Brothers, Brown Bird, and Aoife O'Donovan early on in their now thriving careers.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The OLS nonprofit mission, established in 2011, also underscores our </span>commitment to bringing music and art into the daily lives of children in the greater Portland area<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. Through a shared commitment and partnerships with other Portland nonprofits and community organizations, we are able to </span>reach out to underserved youth and engage them with exciting, hands-on programming.<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> School groups use our flexible space during the day and a great number of Portland kids have performed on our stage, presenting their own original work in music, dance, and theater.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<h4>PARTNERSHIPS AND COMMUNITY ARE AT THE HEART OF WHAT MAKES OLS TICK, AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SHARE NEWS OF TWO NEW PARTNERSHIPS IN THE WORKS FOR THIS FALL:</h4>
<p><b>MAINE ACADEMY OF MODERN MUSIC:</b> MAMM will expand our monthly Kids Open Mic program from welcoming singer-songerwriters on the first Sunday of the month, to expanding musical genres to include rock on the second Sunday and jazz, bluegrass or hip-hop on the third Sunday of each month.  In addition, with support from the Davis Family Foundation, MAMM will utilize our ""urban classroom"" to provide music lessons for underserved kids in the community several days a week.</p>
<p><b>BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC MONTHLY STUDENT SHOWCASE</b>: Joe Walsh, OLS Board Member and instructor in the American Roots Music Program at Berklee College of Music, piloted this showcase last year with great reception from Portland music fans. Beginning in January, we will bring some of the most talented young musicians in the country to the OLS stage once again.</p>
<h3>Other recent arts and music programming for youth have included:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boys &amp; Girls Club of Southern Maine:  theatre and dance performances</li>
<li>LearningWorks and Reiche School:  claymation workshop with Oak Street Studio</li>
<li>Center for Grieving Children: songwriting workshops and CD release party with immigrant youth</li>

<h3>OLS IS AT A CROSSROADS AND WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW TO CONTINUE.</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are asking our community to make One Longfellow Square a permanent part of the cultural fabric of Portland, Maine as a community-supported nonprofit. Our $40,000 IndieGoGo campaign will provide the seed funding that will sustain us this year as we launch the other facets of our development program including new community partnerships and our corporate sponsorship program.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A $10 gift - and a $10 challenge to 10 of your live music loving friends goes a long way to meeting our goal - one live music fan at a time. Or maybe you are able to make a gift of $200 to support the purchase of one of 200 new, comfy chairs for the venue (one with YOUR name on it!). Have a look at our perks in the righthand column and decide which giving level suits your budget. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Keep the stage lights on and the doors open at One Longfellow Square!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The success of this campaign lies in the hands of many live music fans in Maine, and in neighborhoods around the country and the world who value the experience of live music in small venues.  Please share this message with many.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thanks for listening. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thanks for giving. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thanks for spreading the word.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>“As a professional touring musician since 1977, I can say that One Longfellow is on a short list of the best listening rooms in the U.S.  My criteria include location, sound, good layout, staff professionalism and friendliness, and perfect size for serious acoustic music. I put it in a class with the great acoustic venues: Ann Arbor’s The Ark, Berkeley’s Freight and Salvage, Boston’s Club Passim, and Chicago’s Old Town School Of Music - all of which, by the way, are now nonprofits. One Longfellow is an essential lynchpin of the Northeast touring music circuit, meaning: We really need and love this place!”</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><b><i>- Darol Anger, Fiddler, Composer, Producer, Berklee professor</i></b></p>
<p><br/></p>“One Longfellow serves as an integral and unique piece of the music c<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ommunity in the Greater Portland area. There's no other venue in the a</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">rea that provides such intimacy (while seating two hundred) with ambiance, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">professionalism, and impeccable sound. One Longfellow is an asset to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Portland, and has fostered a culture of listening and appreciation </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">with a relaxed and playful vibe. Thank you!!”</span><p></p>

A jewel in the crown of fine listening rooms across the country.

In the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose statue keeps watch over OLS in the thriving city square we call home:
""Music is the universal language of mankind.""

ONE LONGFELLOW SQUARE PROVIDES A TRULY UNIQUE EXPERIENCE FOR PERFORMERS OF ALL GENRES AND AUDIENCES OF ALL AGES
We are not a crowded bar or a formal concert hall. We are a 200-seat neighborhood listening room in the culturally rich city of Portland, Maine. OLS is an intimate space where people of all walks of life come together and become part of the performance.
While we search out the finest national and international talent to bring to Maine, we also support our vibrant local music scene, from the state's most established artists to young regional musicians at the beginning of their careers. Music legends like Tom Rush and Ronnie Earl return to our stage year after year, yet we are equally proud to have presented artists like The Punch Brothers, Brown Bird, and Aoife O'Donovan early on in their now thriving careers.
The OLS nonprofit mission, established in 2011, also underscores our commitment to bringing music and art into the daily lives of children in the greater Portland area. Through a shared commitment and partnerships with other Portland nonprofits and community organizations, we are able to reach out to underserved youth and engage them with exciting, hands-on programming. School groups use our flexible space during the day and a great number of Portland kids have performed on our stage, presenting their own original work in music, dance, and theater.

PARTNERSHIPS AND COMMUNITY ARE AT THE HEART OF WHAT MAKES OLS TICK, AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SHARE NEWS OF TWO NEW PARTNERSHIPS IN THE WORKS FOR THIS FALL:
MAINE ACADEMY OF MODERN MUSIC: MAMM will expand our monthly Kids Open Mic program from welcoming singer-songerwriters on the first Sunday of the month, to expanding musical genres to include rock on the second Sunday and jazz, bluegrass or hip-hop on the third Sunday of each month.  In addition, with support from the Davis Family Foundation, MAMM will utilize our ""urban classroom"" to provide music lessons for underserved kids in the community several days a week.
BERKLEE COLLEGE OF MUSIC MONTHLY STUDENT SHOWCASE: Joe Walsh, OLS Board Member and instructor in the American Roots Music Program at Berklee College of Music, piloted this showcase last year with great reception from Portland music fans. Beginning in January, we will bring some of the most talented young musicians in the country to the OLS stage once again.
Other recent arts and music programming for youth have included:

Boys & Girls Club of Southern Maine:  theatre and dance performances
LearningWorks and Reiche School:  claymation workshop with Oak Street Studio
Center for Grieving Children: songwriting workshops and CD release party with immigrant youth
Monthly Kids Open Mic: hosted by teens for kids and teens
The Real School:  hands-on sound technician short course for teens


OLS IS AT A CROSSROADS AND WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW TO CONTINUE.
We are asking our community to make One Longfellow Square a permanent part of the cultural fabric of Portland, Maine as a community-supported nonprofit. Our $40,000 IndieGoGo campaign will provide the seed funding that will sustain us this year as we launch the other facets of our development program including new community partnerships and our corporate sponsorship program.
A $10 gift - and a $10 challenge to 10 of your live music loving friends goes a long way to meeting our goal - one live music fan at a time. Or maybe you are able to make a gift of $200 to support the purchase of one of 200 new, comfy chairs for the venue (one with YOUR name on it!). Have a look at our perks in the righthand column and decide which giving level suits your budget. 
Keep the stage lights on and the doors open at One Longfellow Square!
The success of this campaign lies in the hands of many live music fans in Maine, and in neighborhoods around the country and the world who value the experience of live music in small venues.  Please share this message with many.
Thanks for listening. Thanks for giving. Thanks for spreading the word.



WHAT MEMBERS OF THE ARTS COMMUNITY ARE SAYING ABOUT ONE LONGFELLOW SQUARE:

“As a professional touring musician since 1977, I can say that One Longfellow is on a short list of the best listening rooms in the U.S.  My criteria include location, sound, good layout, staff professionalism and friendliness, and perfect size for serious acoustic music. I put it in a class with the great acoustic venues: Ann Arbor’s The Ark, Berkeley’s Freight and Salvage, Boston’s Club Passim, and Chicago’s Old Town School Of Music - all of which, by the way, are now nonprofits. One Longfellow is an essential lynchpin of the Northeast touring music circuit, meaning: We really need and love this place!”
- Darol Anger, Fiddler, Composer, Producer, Berklee professor
“One Longfellow serves as an integral and unique piece of the music community in the Greater Portland area. There's no other venue in the area that provides such intimacy (while seating two hundred) with ambiance, professionalism, and impeccable sound. One Longfellow is an asset to Portland, and has fostered a culture of listening and appreciation with a relaxed and playful vibe. Thank you!!”

- Emilia Dahlin, Singer-Songwriter
Voted Portland's Best Local Female Vocalist,  2005, 2006, 2007


“One Longfellow Square is a vibrant contributor to the Portland music scene. Their diverse programming and intimate setting offers a unique experience to the city's cultural calendar. They have a great location at the entrance to the downtown arts district. We are delighted to see their programming expanding.  The trolley stops right at their door on First Fridays — check them out!""
- Jennifer Hutchins, Executive Director, Creative Portland

Obviously I'm passionate about this project and will continue working on the music if this campaign does not reach it's goal, but the closer to the goal we get, the less time it will take to produce and obviously the more we receive, the higher the quality of the production will go.    The Impact Before you give, I just want to thank you for even reading this portion:  This project is more than just me recording music. It is giving me the chance to return to something I am truly passionate about. I have successfully produced 4 albums with my previous band and I produce other artists as well so I know what to do once the funding is there. Once we accomplish this goal, you'll be able to see the album on iTunes and other distribution points and know that YOU were a major part of bringing this project to the marketplace.    Risks & Challenges  This is a very new and scary concept for me. I've never done a crowd funding project before and I HATE having to ask for help. But over the years, I have learned that it is truly better to share the load with talented people than trying to do it all by myself.  I'll admit that I'm not sure if I'm interesting enough for people to even want to be involved. But I truly hope that people will share and contribute to this project in order to help me reach this goal. Let's make some music!
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute and that's ok, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please help to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Remember to use the INDIEGOGO share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to fund the production of my debut studio album. I'm working with London producer Charlie Dawe. With the album finished produced, mixed &amp; mastered me and Charlie will pitch this to labels. Making this album will help me and get my music to the next level and also I will be able to do full length gigs and tours with this.</p>
<h3><strong>WHO IS RAY NOIR?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm a recording artist living in London. </p>
<p>I grew up in the comparatively tranquil climes of Norway, travelling through cities like Oslo and Paris before settling in London. I've always been massively influenced by the metal, industrial and rock movements, cutting my teeth on artists like Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p>I started as a DJ, but always wanted to make my own music. After meeting Frankmusik at a party in London, we collaborated in the studio, and birthed my first hit, punk/industrial stomper ‘Double Trouble’. My second single 'All Alone' ft. Mariann Rosa came out in February this year and both singles and videos was released to critical success from publications like Esquire Magazine, Kaltblut Magazine, World of Wonder Reports, Vampire Freaks, Attitude Magazine, Gay Times, and perezhilton.com, as well as international attention from South Korea to Colombia. Both songs charted at the German Alternative Charts.</p>
<h3><strong>Rewards</strong></h3>
<p>As rewards you can get merch bundles, exclusive t-shirts, beanies, signed poster + stickers, get your hands on the album before release date,  skype conversation with me, get your name tattooed on my body, get a portrait of you made as a caricature and tattooed on my body,  dinner date with me in London (eating my favourite food, Pizza). I will also be giving away my beloved leather jacket with my first logo painted on the back. I've been wearing this jacket for many years and it's been used on stage many times.</p>

<p>The goal is to get in £3000. £2500 will be going to produce the tracks, studio time to record vocals. The rest will be going for mixing and mastering and print tee's for you who support this crowdfunding. </p>
<h3><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p>If the project is not funded, it will take longer for me to be able to present a finished album to labels and also it will mean i won't be able to do any tours or gigs at the moment. </p>

<p><strong>Please help support The Discs debut album, a punk rock/new wave project by musician Allan Day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because</strong> a troubled 15 year old kid named Allan Day was so moved by punk rock that he began writing his own songs, chronicling the world around him, emulating his idols.</p>
<p><strong>Because</strong> those songs were typed on a Smith Corona and lay in a bin for years, chord progressions committed to memory, some demoed over the years, others coaxed from the recesses.</p>
<p><strong>Because</strong> of the failed efforts back then by that 15 year old to assemble a band called <strong>The Discs,</strong> even though he and fellow punk Glenn assembled a meeting with bassist Minda and others.  For lack of interest, though, the project was abandoned...until now.</p>
<p><strong>Because</strong> recording and releasing a Discs album in hellish 2020 by this same guy would simply be more fun than not doing so. </p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, because the world needs some levity and fun right now, I’m proud to finally present the debut album by <strong>The Discs</strong>.</p>
<p>Please help support this project to help offset the costs of studio time by donating now.  There are incentives at each tier that include a digital copy of the album, complete 4 panel artwork, t-shirts, stickers as well as upper tier incentives such as DJ dance parties and private concerts.</p>
<p>Thanks for watching this and for your consideration - I really do appreciate it - and most importantly, thank you for making this 15 year old’s dream a reality!</p>

We start off in November with Julie Silva and members of Indimaj in Asfur, a program that blends Mideastern folk music, jazz, and classical music by Middle Eastern composers.  In January horn player Anne-Marie and violinist Sean Riley will  join me for Eroica.  Think music that's bold, heroic, and brassy, culminating in one of my favorite chamber works-Brahms' Horn Trio in E flat.  To celebrate Women's month, we have Femme- a concert with music by all women composers.  My collaborators will be two of my favorite women, mezzo soprano Liz Cass and cellist Barbara George.  Finally, we close the season with Groove: classical music with intense rhythm and drive.  Adam Bedell, percussionist from Line upon Line, and local violinist Turner Partain will help me bring the house down with classical music that will make you wanna dance (or at least tap your foot).  Here's a rundown of our dates/times.</p><p><strong>Asfur</strong>:  Sunday November 4 at 8pm</p><p><strong>Eroica</strong>: Saturday January 26 at 8pm and Sunday January 27 at 8:30pm</p><p><strong>Femme</strong>: Sunday March 24 at 8pm and Monday March 25 at 8pm</p><p><strong>Groove:</strong> Friday April 19 at 8pm</p><p>This year we are expanding, with two performances of most programs and two collaborators on each.  Of course, putting on events costs money, and for each concert, we’ll need funding for marketing, programs, ticketing, and the venue rental.  These expenses together add up to about half of the $1000 dollars I’m raising for each concert. The other half allows me to pay the performing artists.  I’m very proud to bring you award winning performers from the Austin area, and these funds allow me to pay them for their imaginative, moving performances they are bringing to the stage. Of course, for perks we offer season tickets, ticket packages, signed posters, and all donors will be recognized in the program for their generous support.  </p><p>Together we can help continue this concert series in Austin, but also support art events that focus on collaboration and open up classical music performance to be heard in new and refreshing ways.  For years, and I have organized recitals and performances as a private teacher, and have co-curated concerts with ACMC during their summer festival for the past 10 years.

We start off in November with Julie Silva and members of Indimaj in Asfur, a program that blends Mideastern folk music, jazz, and classical music by Middle Eastern composers.  In January horn player Anne-Marie and violinist Sean Riley will  join me for Eroica.  Think music that's bold, heroic, and brassy, culminating in one of my favorite chamber works-Brahms' Horn Trio in E flat.  To celebrate Women's month, we have Femme- a concert with music by all women composers.  My collaborators will be two of my favorite women, mezzo soprano Liz Cass and cellist Barbara George.  Finally, we close the season with Groove: classical music with intense rhythm and drive.  Adam Bedell, percussionist from Line upon Line, and local violinist Turner Partain will help me bring the house down with classical music that will make you wanna dance (or at least tap your foot).  Here's a rundown of our dates/times.Asfur:  Sunday November 4 at 8pmEroica: Saturday January 26 at 8pm and Sunday January 27 at 8:30pmFemme: Sunday March 24 at 8pm and Monday March 25 at 8pmGroove: Friday April 19 at 8pmThis year we are expanding, with two performances of most programs and two collaborators on each.  Of course, putting on events costs money, and for each concert, we’ll need funding for marketing, programs, ticketing, and the venue rental.  These expenses together add up to about half of the $1000 dollars I’m raising for each concert. The other half allows me to pay the performing artists.  I’m very proud to bring you award winning performers from the Austin area, and these funds allow me to pay them for their imaginative, moving performances they are bringing to the stage. Of course, for perks we offer season tickets, ticket packages, signed posters, and all donors will be recognized in the program for their generous support.  Together we can help continue this concert series in Austin, but also support art events that focus on collaboration and open up classical music performance to be heard in new and refreshing ways.  For years, and I have organized recitals and performances as a private teacher, and have co-curated concerts with ACMC during their summer festival for the past 10 years. Through these years of programming I have collaborated with dozens with amazing performers, and amazed at how the concerts are already coming into shape.  Last year I was so moved by the experience of collaborating with friends and connecting with a local audience.  A series like this is a big undertaking, but I’ve already been blown away by the enthusiasm of the other artists involved, the interest shown on social media, and the aid of my marketing team.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Transports Project is an Inter-Cultural Music Project bringing together French and Indian artists. This collaboration is one of its kind, blending the two cultures and their musical styles aesthetically into one. This project is spearheaded by Julie Bonnafont and her group of lyricists from France, whose tour across the Indian state of Tamil Nadu inspired them to pen-down their experiences in French. As music students of A R Rahman’s <strong>K M Music Conservatory</strong>, we got on board this project in August 2017, to set music to these lyrics, giving rise to a fun collaboration and a very interesting music album of 14 songs! Under the guidance of our composition faculty, Dr. James Bunch, we were able to bring in flavors from across the country (Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Kerala etc) into a range of folk, pop and Indian Classical Music traditions into these French lyrics! </p>

<p>This album, named ‘No Parking’ has been recorded in the Conservatory’s studio by our team of members in December 2017. The Premier Showcase took place at the<strong> Indo-French Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IFCCI)</strong> and received a warm reception. It is being produced by BECARRE PRODUCTION (A Record Label based out of Orleans, France) and is currently in the post-production stage.</p>
<p>Furthering this project, we, <strong>Aditya Ravindran &amp; Karthik Manickavasakam</strong>, have been invited to join three other French Musicians, to showcase some songs from the album, across various cities in France, details of which are given below:</p>

<p>This project is the result of hard work and dedication of a number of students from the Conservatory, spanning 5 months. This showcase is a testament to all the efforts taken by these budding artists and will prove to be, important and fruitful to our careers as musicians.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised through this campaign will primarily sponsor our travel and support our living in France for the showcase tour. We hope to bring back something to cherish, to all contributors of this campaign, after the successful completion of this trip. The details of which will be revealed soon, we promise!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is a showcase of many upcoming and talented artists of our country. A tour of this kind is nothing short of a dream-come-true for budding musicians. Setting Indian tunes to lyrics of a foreign language was no easy feat. We have poured our sweat and blood into this project, working through tedious long hours, ardently trying to beat those creative roadblocks. The true success of this project, or any music, lies in the hands of the audience and their appreciation is our true reward. We are excited to take our music one-step further, to France, hoping to receive the same warm reception that we did here, in our December concerts. Your contributions will go a great deal in realizing this dream of ours. Through this crowd-funding campaign, we invite you, to not just contribute, but to be a part of this special journey of ours!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With one month to go for our showcase tour, the biggest challenge we are facing is the time constraint. However, we believe that we will be able to meet this campaign target soon enough through your contributions.  Any and every small contribution will go a long way and get us closer to our dream and destination. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kevin Gerdes. I am living in Los Angeles, CA where I take EVERY DAY to make my dream of making music happen! I have lived in LA for 1 year and 2 months. In such short time I have created my first single, which is now in the iTunes store for download! The song in titled ""Come Away With Me"". I have worked on various entertainment projects from modeling, to acting, and singing. Other then releasing my single this year I am mostly proud of my featured role on the NBC comedy Outsourced.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As the release of my first single is complete, I am now focused on my second song. I have got to keep this fire burning! I am working with an AWESOME music producer, Mark Grilliot. Mark has worked with various entertainment professionals and celebrities. I know that I am very blessed to be able to work with such a talented man. I find our relationship works so well because not only are we music partners, we are friends.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My second song is going to continue in the genere of Pop. However, unlike my first song it will be slightly slower and more of a defined love story. Think Bruno Mars.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have a deadline of 60 days to raise the funds for this project, however I am eager to begin the song as soon as possible! It is important to always have something fresh for the world to hear!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact that this project has on others is always, like anything I work hard on, is to inspire people to dream. I come from a town in Maryland where it is not uncommon to get stuck in one way of life. I love to give people the ability to have hope in themselves and to never give up on their dreams. I receive everything from emails, text messages, facebook and twitter messages, etc from past friends congratulating me on how far I have come since here in LA. Some also tell me how much I have allowed them to be excited about possibility again. That in itself is an amazing feeling. Knowing that you can inspire others through believing that your dreams will come true is out of this world. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So the impact of this project and anything that I do is to inspire the people that this song will touch. To let people know that, DREAMS DO COME TRUE!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Oh and there is one more... My older brothers have a child each. Hearing from them that their children dance along to my songs is one of the best feelings that I've ever felt. I live 3,000 miles from my niece and nephew. Being able to do things that I have always loved such as making music and for them to be able to listen and dance to MY MUSIC is a way for me to be directly in their lives.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lets break this down. We all know that VERY LITTLE is done for free. To make this second song a reality for myself and for YOU $1300.00 is needed to be raised. Every penny that is raised will be used entirely on this project. No matter how much money is raised, all of it will go to this music project. If more the the projected goal is raised then the balance thereafter will go to funding the next song! Lets make an ALBUM!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help by donating money to my project then NO PROBLEM! If you dont have $1.00 to give to this project... then NO PROBLEM! I bet you know someone who does! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It is important that everyone realize that I am only able to reach a limited amount of people via the internet. So I ask you... take ONE moment and use the share tools on this page or copy and paste this link onto your facebook, myspace, twitter, and other social network pages so that your friends and family can give to this project. If you show that this is important to you. If you show people that aiding in the development of others goals and lifelong dreams is important to YOU, then others will follow your actions! </p>

<h3>A propos de l'artiste</h3>
<p>Hot Hell RooM a été créé en septembre 2003 par trois 
musiciens et amis de longue date : Alan Raoul à la basse (Invading 
Chapel, ex Coldown et 7th Nemesis), Loïc Malassagne au chant et à la 
guitare (Invading Chapel et ex Anthemon) et Stone à la batterie. <br/> 
Une première démo autoproduite ""Lies Box"" (3 titres) voit le jour en 
octobre 2005 et sera suivie d’une série de plusieurs concerts courant 
l’année 2006. <br/> L’album démo ""Hot Hell Room"" (12 titres) enregistré 
dans leur « studio maison » sera masterisé par le producteur américain 
Beau Hill (Alice Cooper, Europe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Winger Etc...). 
Il sera disponible en numérique sur iTunes, Musicme et autres 
plate-formes via le label Alien Prod. <br/> En janvier 2010, le batteur 
Stone quitte le groupe et sera remplacé par Ludovic Rouix (Ex-Evolvent, 
Ex Anthemon). Le titre ""You Don't Belong To Them"" apparait sur la 
compilation N°11 du webzine Pavillon 666 en juin 2010.<br/> Entre 
septembre 2011 et février 2012, le groupe travaille sur son premier 
album officiel ""Kali Yuga Bonfire"" (12 titres) et il sera enregistré, 
mixé et masterisé au Hybreed Studio (As They Burn, The Arrs, 7th 
Nemesis...) par Andrew G, sauf pour les batteries qui seront 
enregistrées au Roots Notes Studio par Pierre Houllier.<br/> Septembre 2012, le guitariste Shazybob vient renforcer le groupe pour les concerts.<br/>
 Le titre ""Wistful Sunset"", extrait du nouvel album, apparait sur la 
compilation du webzine French Métal ""La Colère Des Dieux "" n°15 de 
décembre 2012.<br/> Mai 2013, l'album ""Kali Yuga Bonfire"" est disponible 
via le e-shop de Dooweet Records. En juillet, le groupe sort son premier
 clip officiel avec le titre ""Humanity Will Never Change"" et il sera 
produit par Eddy Norman.</p>
<br/><p>En Septembre 2013, Sébastien Luccioni rejoint le groupe en poste de guitariste complétant ainsi la formation.</p>

Chapel, ex Coldown et 7th Nemesis), Loïc Malassagne au chant et à la 
guitare (Invading Chapel et ex Anthemon) et Stone à la batterie.  
Une première démo autoproduite ""Lies Box"" (3 titres) voit le jour en 
octobre 2005 et sera suivie d’une série de plusieurs concerts courant 
l’année 2006.  L’album démo ""Hot Hell Room"" (12 titres) enregistré 
dans leur « studio maison » sera masterisé par le producteur américain 
Beau Hill (Alice Cooper, Europe, Ratt, Twisted Sister, Winger Etc...). 
Il sera disponible en numérique sur iTunes, Musicme et autres 
plate-formes via le label Alien Prod.  En janvier 2010, le batteur 
Stone quitte le groupe et sera remplacé par Ludovic Rouix (Ex-Evolvent, 
Ex Anthemon). Le titre ""You Don't Belong To Them"" apparait sur la 
compilation N°11 du webzine Pavillon 666 en juin 2010. Entre 
septembre 2011 et février 2012, le groupe travaille sur son premier 
album officiel ""Kali Yuga Bonfire"" (12 titres) et il sera enregistré, 
mixé et masterisé au Hybreed Studio (As They Burn, The Arrs, 7th 
Nemesis...) par Andrew G, sauf pour les batteries qui seront 
enregistrées au Roots Notes Studio par Pierre Houllier. Septembre 2012, le guitariste Shazybob vient renforcer le groupe pour les concerts.
 Le titre ""Wistful Sunset"", extrait du nouvel album, apparait sur la 
compilation du webzine French Métal ""La Colère Des Dieux "" n°15 de 
décembre 2012. Mai 2013, l'album ""Kali Yuga Bonfire"" est disponible 
via le e-shop de Dooweet Records. En juillet, le groupe sort son premier
 clip officiel avec le titre ""Humanity Will Never Change"" et il sera 
produit par Eddy Norman.
En Septembre 2013, Sébastien Luccioni rejoint le groupe en poste de guitariste complétant ainsi la formation.

<p></p>
<p>At first, we originally thought of ""Wine Country"" as a fun way to make beautiful art and music about a richly inspiring region.  But we realized the project would need to be more than sweet songs set to lovely pastoral image sequences. We discovered many larger than life characters that involved some stranger than fiction stories in the history of the wine country. We made a few real discoveries that will surprise you and some 'hidden' stories - that really need to be told and deserve wider recognition.  </p>

</div></div>","Wine Country Tales, Volume 1: Sonoma and Napa - Preview on SoundCloud
This innovative CD and DVD pairs
the guitar music of Brian Gore with art by Bill Russell, to
tell stories of the California wine country and coast. The CD features 8
original guitar songs inspired by the history and environs of Marin, Sonoma and
Napa. The DVD includes 6 original animated stories that highlight interesting
people and places in the wine country, including: Muir Woods, The Last California Mission, Jack London's Wolf House, Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Silverado
Squatters,"" the misadventures of Edward Bale and his Grist Mill in St. Helena, and the story of Chinese
immigrant labor. 


In terms of the flow of the music and art – we conceived this as a tour north from San Francisco into the wine country. You'll pass by Muir Woods, so consider a visit to the towering redwoods. Then head up to Sonoma, near the town of Glen Ellen and the ruins of the Wolf House in Jack London State Park. From there, it’s easy to trek into Napa Valley and Bale's Mill south of Calistoga. You'll then travel through St. Helena,  and into the town of Napa. It’s a kind of “musical map,” of the region – and by no means an exhaustive one. There’s so much to see and do here. But the stories we’ve chosen reveal a lot about the depth of influences that shape the region.



There's nothing like this pairing of guitar music and original art in an original duo. Some of the art we have integrated
into this unique CD and DVD package was created live during our concert
performances. Our
first project together, ""Santa Cruz in Song and Image,"" also a musical map, combined music with static illustrations, which suited the
inspiring scenic environs and pastoral music we chose. For “Wine Country,” we started telling
tales using multi-media; so, in this release, we include a DVD of animated videos, alongside an audio CD of the
music.

 Your contributions will go towards helping us recoup our investment in developing and producing the release. This process has taken more than a year of work, and has had its challenges.  The subjects and locations we treated required more than just matching beautiful songs and images to them. Each song on this album tells its own true story, supported by the videos and illustrations. This involved painstaking preparation, research, and even some historical scholarship.  The result is an inspiring auditory and visual experience - combining art and music into a one-of-a-kind release.   

What We Need & What You Get We would like to get enough funds to recoup our labor, production and promotion costs for this release.  That includes production costs for the beautifully designed 4-panel digipack CD/DVD and 24-page booklet, the 8 songs and many lush and beautiful illustrations and animations that go into the DVD.  
Support of the project helps us continue the work of this innovative duo which we want to expand into a second volume featuring other wine country regions of California. In the process, you'll receive a great product that provides a source of new discoveries for you about the region, as well as how art and music can be combined in innovative ways. 
For guitar aficionados, we have a special gift pack of strings, string winder and tuner from D'Addario/Planet Waves.

At first, we originally thought of ""Wine Country"" as a fun way to make beautiful art and music about a richly inspiring region.  But we realized the project would need to be more than sweet songs set to lovely pastoral image sequences. We discovered many larger than life characters that involved some stranger than fiction stories in the history of the wine country. We made a few real discoveries that will surprise you and some 'hidden' stories - that really need to be told and deserve wider recognition.

<ul>
<li>Our NEWEST single, LA RUTINA DEL MUJERIEGO, is straight up amazing and all of the other songs that we have been preparing are just as catchy and sweet but we need the funds and sponsorship to be able to bring them to life and make them available for all of you (our friends and fans).</li>
<li>We are itching to make our follow up album and include a professional, storyline music video as well.  Not a video of the band 'playing' but more story based, like the late great M.J.</li> <li>We would be able to reach a greater number of people through newer avenues that require this type of media/video.  We can submit to prime Music Video stations, among other things. A dream come true for my dad.. and, of course, it'd be nice to have YOUR name attached to the credits for making it happen!</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Realistically, a full album can run in the 10s of thousands, but I believe we can make one for about $20,000.  The $5,000 goal is at least to secure that we can begin the process and possible prepare 2-3 more songs.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we meet our base goal, then all of the funds will go straight to studio recording session.</span>
</li>
<li>Regarding a video, after having many conversations with different videographers and directors, the average quote has kinda been between $5,000 - $8,000.  We love to play but local musicians just don't earn or get enough to really make these things happen easily.</li>
<li>Now, we are really interested in cooperation and participation, in any form.  So, at the very least, having your name appear in the final credits is pretty damn cool.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Helping someone achieve a goal is one thing.  Helping a family obtain a dream is far greater.  Your pledge and contribution moves us one step closer to that dream:</p> <ul>
<li>Grupo Arcano breaks the mold in so many ways.  We keep the essence of traditional salsa without making it something else, yet we've brought such a new and refreshing sound and face to the scene, let's keep moving forward..</li> <li>Oour first album (Desde El Otro Lado Del East River) was considered by many one of the best albums released in 2012.  we received an award for Best Album from Manchester, UK for the album.  We have begun to catch the eye of some nice big festivals like, MUSIKFEST in Bethlehem, PA.</li> <li>We really love making new friends and fans and nowadays we have something most of us never had before years ago. We can have ACCESS to the musicians as fans!.  We want you to really be a part of this experience so we will share pics and videos and are even available to chat whenever.  It's a privilege for us to communicate with all of you.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p> Having and sustaining such a big band is not easy (Arcano is 13 musicians).  Local venues do not pay out enough and almost always try to ""encourage"" us to cut down the size of our band.  REALLY?!  They want us to lose the integrity of our music and sound for a few dollars?  The fight to maintain and remain such a big band is difficult and some of us have demanding responsibilities (just like all of you) outside of the band.  But, Arcano has way more than POTENTIAL.  We have GREAT chemistry that comes across every time we play.  So many have begun gravitating toward our music.  And others look to actively disrupt what we have going, sad but true.</p>

But they have always felt a wealth of support from friends and family and interested listeners, and are grateful for it.  And, are once again (sorry!) appealing for this support from any who might be in a position to give it.  <br/>
In order to press the new album on vinyl, <strong>C&amp;D need to raise $2200</strong>.  Any financial kindness will be rewarded in C &amp; D goods: their entire discography is available, as well as their <em>Emotionally Available/Unavailable</em> hand-woodburned doorhangers, and hoodies and t-shirts designed by them (or sister <a href=""http://www.mariannecollins.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marianne Collins</a>) and manufactured in Nova Scotia, Canada at Stanfield’s.<br/>
Construction &amp; Destruction have been quietly making work from their rural home by the sea in Nova Scotia for about six years now, and have been generously rewarded for their efforts by being invited to play and tour throughout Canada and Europe.  Construction &amp; Destruction’s work can be perused at:<br/><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/davidtrenaman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">myspace</a><br/><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Construction-Destruction/107458462613886"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a><br/>
And they’ve been fortunate to come across the following kind words describing their musical efforts:<br/><em>Doomily experimental garage-rock</em><br/>
-Time Out London  <br/><em>[L]iterate lo-fi […;] it deserves your full attention, absolutely.  Only with all one’s attention directed hereto is the true beauty of Construction &amp; Destruction realised.</em><br/>
-Musings On Linguistics And Cheese  <br/><em>Construction &amp; Destruction might not fit into the average listener’s wheelhouse, but what they are doing is worth your time.  […] They push themselves and challenge you to stay with them, offering you little rewards at the most unexpected times.</em> <br/>
-Herohill</p>
<p>Any support shown in the past has been greatly appreciated, and has enabled them to keep at it when things’ve gotten rough, making getting up in the mornings (-afternoons?) that much easier.  <strong>Any support sent their way at this time would be incredibly appreciated</strong>, as things are pretty tight, and help would enable them not only to fulfill their long-time desire to have their work pressed to vinyl, but also to continue slogging away at the making of their work at all.  C &amp; D’s approach to making work has often been cited as “do-it-yourself”, but this is not entirely true.  They’ve been bolstered by the generosity of others, and could not make the work without help.<br/>
Please know that if the fundraising goal is met and exceeded, any additional funds would be put into keeping their musical engine puttering… And please feel free to pass this appeal along to anyone who might be interested…<br/>

And, are once again (sorry!) appealing for this support from any who might be in a position to give it.  
In order to press the new album on vinyl, C&D need to raise $2200.  Any financial kindness will be rewarded in C & D goods: their entire discography is available, as well as their Emotionally Available/Unavailable hand-woodburned doorhangers, and hoodies and t-shirts designed by them (or sister Marianne Collins) and manufactured in Nova Scotia, Canada at Stanfield’s.
Construction & Destruction have been quietly making work from their rural home by the sea in Nova Scotia for about six years now, and have been generously rewarded for their efforts by being invited to play and tour throughout Canada and Europe.  Construction & Destruction’s work can be perused at:myspacefacebook
And they’ve been fortunate to come across the following kind words describing their musical efforts:Doomily experimental garage-rock
-Time Out London  [L]iterate lo-fi […;] it deserves your full attention, absolutely.  Only with all one’s attention directed hereto is the true beauty of Construction & Destruction realised.
-Musings On Linguistics And Cheese  Construction & Destruction might not fit into the average listener’s wheelhouse, but what they are doing is worth your time.  […] They push themselves and challenge you to stay with them, offering you little rewards at the most unexpected times. 
-Herohill
Any support shown in the past has been greatly appreciated, and has enabled them to keep at it when things’ve gotten rough, making getting up in the mornings (-afternoons?) that much easier.  Any support sent their way at this time would be incredibly appreciated, as things are pretty tight, and help would enable them not only to fulfill their long-time desire to have their work pressed to vinyl, but also to continue slogging away at the making of their work at all.  C & D’s approach to making work has often been cited as “do-it-yourself”, but this is not entirely true.  They’ve been bolstered by the generosity of others, and could not make the work without help.
Please know that if the fundraising goal is met and exceeded, any additional funds would be put into keeping their musical engine puttering… And please feel free to pass this appeal along to anyone who might be interested…

United States and up the west coast, playing 20-30 shows in a variety of
 formats, including house concerts, popular music venues, and street

 FRIEND OF FRIEND tour (FOF) was a two week experiment with house

Northampton, MA, and ending in Miami, FL. It grossed $1,300 and yielded a
 profit of $600 after expenses (gas, food, etc.). In addition, we raised
 $160 for the Latino Economic Development Corporation, a non-profit that
 hosted a concert as a fundraiser in Wheaton, MD.  All the money raised 
was by donation, including CD “sales.”  </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Let
 us take this opportunity to say one more huge thank you to everyone who
 came out to support the FRIEND OF A FRIEND tour! It was a total 
success, on many levels, and was an incredible learning experience. We 
learned so much about why touring is the way bands break into the music 
business. We met so many lovely people, all showering us with support 
and encouragement, which made the burden of traveling totally worth it. 
We learned that the more people we played for, the more likely we were 
to be discovered. We also learned that within our own small community of
 friends, friends of friends, and family there were tremendous amounts 
of resources waiting to be uncovered and put to use.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">A Love Story</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Tony Bernardo of Juneau Sky had just finished recording his new album, </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Come Back Together</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">,
 when he met Sarah St. Germain. Eager to form a band and promote the new
 album, Tony set out for Northampton - a more urban part of western 
Massachusetts than his former home in Shutesbury. After a frustrating 
month and a half of searching for a place he stumbled upon a small house
 just outside of town, but more importantly, a beautiful housemate! 
Turns out she was also a singer/songwriter and despite all odds, a 
pretty darn good one. Their shared passion for music provided a spark, 
but both were weary of dating their housemate. </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Never
 the less, they began having unofficial dates in their living room. 
Before you knew it they were “taking it slow” and “getting to know each 
other first.” Then something special happened: Sarah sang her original 
song </span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">Little Lives</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">
 to Tony. That sealed the deal! It didn’t take long for Sarah to admit 
to her mutual feelings for Tony, and so they began testing their 
chemistry, both romantically and musically.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">In
 a flurry of passion, they began fleshing out Sarah’s songs one by one. 
Sarah was able to overcome her crucial handicap of not being able to 
play an instrument and Tony was able to take a break from his own music 
to facilitate Sarah’s development. Rather than form a group together and
 risk smothering each other, as so many other couples would have, they 
decided to honor their unique, distinct styles and accompany one another
 in their independent projects. Their vision for interdependent musical 
partnership materialized this fall during the FOF tour.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">The Timeline </span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">STEP 1 - Finish Sarah’s EP</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""> “Becoming</span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">.”
 During the FOF tour there was demand for a recording of Sarah’s music. 
We are in the process of writing, arranging, and producing Sarah’s 
introductory record. It will be five songs of her original music with 
songwriting contributions from Tony. Thanks to the generous support of 
Stone Kawala (<a href=""http://www.stonekawala.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stonekawala.com</a>) they will be making the record at 
home for almost nothing ($200). They will need to pay for 
mixing/mastering ($325) and duplication ($475). An additional $200 will 
be book marked for expenses during our week in DC mixing the record and 
filming the video.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">STEP
 2 - Recording Juneau Sky’s music video ($650). Alma production (also 
found at <a href=""http://www.stonekawala.com/services"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stonekawala.com/services</a>) has agreed to film a music video 
for “On My Feet,” the first single from Juneau Sky. It will be a spoof 
of a Starbucks commercial (several people told Tony that it should be on
 a Starbucks commercial, but he refused to sell out!). The song will 
also be re-recorded and re-mixed at Inner Ear, a state of the art studio
 in Washington, DC ($650). This will help bring the song up to 
commercial quality so that it matches the quality of the video.</span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;""></span><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;"">STEP

record of Sarah’s music and a music video for Juneau Sky. Our goal is to
 raise $3,750 to film a video and make a record in preparation for our 
second tour, the NEW YEAR TOUR. We will be driving across the southern 
United States and up the west coast, playing 20-30 shows in a variety of
 formats, including house concerts, popular music venues, and street 
performing.  We believe that management, publishers, and labels are 
waiting around the corner for us to show up, with 10,000 YouTube hits 
and 5,000 song downloads! Here is where your money will go:1. Sarah’s EP “Being and Becoming” - $1,200 2. Juneau Sky’s  music video - $1,3003. Tour support (a cushion for unexpected costs, car repairs, etc.) - $1,000*IndieGoGo and paypal fees (7% total) - $250PerksSince
 this is not a charity, anyone who donates to this fundraiser will 
receive a ""perk."" A perk is essentially a thank you gift for your 
contribution. In addition, all contributors are invited to a free show at the Axum Level X Lounge in Washington, DC the evening of January 15th.  FRIEND OF A FRIEND Tour - A Success StoryThe
 FRIEND OF FRIEND tour (FOF) was a two week experiment with house 
concert touring. There were eight shows during the tour, starting in 
Northampton, MA, and ending in Miami, FL. It grossed $1,300 and yielded a
 profit of $600 after expenses (gas, food, etc.). In addition, we raised
 $160 for the Latino Economic Development Corporation, a non-profit that
 hosted a concert as a fundraiser in Wheaton, MD.  All the money raised 
was by donation, including CD “sales.”  Let
 us take this opportunity to say one more huge thank you to everyone who
 came out to support the FRIEND OF A FRIEND tour! It was a total 
success, on many levels, and was an incredible learning experience. We 
learned so much about why touring is the way bands break into the music 
business. We met so many lovely people, all showering us with support 
and encouragement, which made the burden of traveling totally worth it. 
We learned that the more people we played for, the more likely we were 
to be discovered. We also learned that within our own small community of
 friends, friends of friends, and family there were tremendous amounts 
of resources waiting to be uncovered and put to use.A Love StoryTony Bernardo of Juneau Sky had just finished recording his new album, Come Back Together,
 when he met Sarah St. Germain. Eager to form a band and promote the new
 album, Tony set out for Northampton - a more urban part of western 
Massachusetts than his former home in Shutesbury. After a frustrating 
month and a half of searching for a place he stumbled upon a small house
 just outside of town, but more importantly, a beautiful housemate! 
Turns out she was also a singer/songwriter and despite all odds, a 
pretty darn good one. Their shared passion for music provided a spark, 
but both were weary of dating their housemate. Never
 the less, they began having unofficial dates in their living room. 
Before you knew it they were “taking it slow” and “getting to know each 
other first.” Then something special happened: Sarah sang her original 
song Little Lives
 to Tony. That sealed the deal! It didn’t take long for Sarah to admit 
to her mutual feelings for Tony, and so they began testing their 
chemistry, both romantically and musically.In
 a flurry of passion, they began fleshing out Sarah’s songs one by one. 
Sarah was able to overcome her crucial handicap of not being able to 
play an instrument and Tony was able to take a break from his own music 
to facilitate Sarah’s development. Rather than form a group together and
 risk smothering each other, as so many other couples would have, they 
decided to honor their unique, distinct styles and accompany one another
 in their independent projects. Their vision for interdependent musical 
partnership materialized this fall during the FOF tour.The Timeline STEP 1 - Finish Sarah’s EP “Becoming.”
 During the FOF tour there was demand for a recording of Sarah’s music. 
We are in the process of writing, arranging, and producing Sarah’s 
introductory record. It will be five songs of her original music with 
songwriting contributions from Tony. Thanks to the generous support of 
Stone Kawala (www.stonekawala.com) they will be making the record at 
home for almost nothing ($200). They will need to pay for 
mixing/mastering ($325) and duplication ($475). An additional $200 will 
be book marked for expenses during our week in DC mixing the record and 
filming the video.STEP
 2 - Recording Juneau Sky’s music video ($650). Alma production (also 
found at www.stonekawala.com/services) has agreed to film a music video 
for “On My Feet,” the first single from Juneau Sky. It will be a spoof 
of a Starbucks commercial (several people told Tony that it should be on
 a Starbucks commercial, but he refused to sell out!). The song will 
also be re-recorded and re-mixed at Inner Ear, a state of the art studio
 in Washington, DC ($650). This will help bring the song up to 
commercial quality so that it matches the quality of the video.STEP
 3 -  Launch the NEW YEAR TOUR! Armed with a record of Sarah’s music, a 
killer video of “On my Feet,” and a $1,000 worth of tour support we’re 
going to win fans, build a buzz, and get the attention of cool industry 
pros! We set sail the last week of January!Thank you all so much for your loving support and encouragement! We could not do this without you!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>If you're just arriving here, welcome to read on if you're interested to know about the backstory of the album and the campaign that pushed it over the brink...</p>

<p><b>NOVEMBER 18, 2014</b>: Thousands of gypsy miles later, my debut album stands on the threshold of completion! I have arrived in Los Angeles and am in the studio with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tinamaliamusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tina Malia</a> in final mixing! The artwork is designed, the last grace-notes recorded, and I am excited and ready to let this out into the world! But in order to do that, I need to clear one final financial hump ~ or as I've been saying, like any good birth this just needs <i>one final push!</i></p>
<p>And that's where you come in...  I ran the initial fundraiser for this album exactly two years ago ~ and though very successful, I knew we would need more funding when the time came to finish it.  Since then I've toured significantly, meeting many new friends and fans ~ so I simply wanted to offer the same perks I did back then for those who didn't get to partake the first time.  Oh yes, and there's a couple extra goodies you might notice in the perk-list for you longtime supporters and super-fans... ;-)  Additionally, take note that the Pre-release is an <b>Exclusive Fan-Release ONLY!</b> The public release will be a month later ~ so in order to assure that you don't have to wait, this is the best way to pre-order your album!</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and did I mention that the album is simply beautiful, danceable, sensuous, entrancing, and somewhat spicy and fun?!  The musicians and producers who have lent their masterful touch have been impeccable and inspiring ~ this has been a hugely collective effort, and it shines with the vibrancy of my virtuosic musical tribe ~ not to mention the power-packed team of advisors and supporters (and yes, that includes YOU!).  I love these people and couldn't have done it without them... </p>

<p><b><i>These musicians, producers, arrangers, and advisors have been both invaluable and a tremendous joy to work with:</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>TINA MALIA</b> ~ Co-producer/arranger/mix-artist extraordinaire! A stunning singer, composer, multi-instrumentalist, and producer, I have been deeply honored to work with Tina for the last two years on this album. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>JESSE MANNO</b> ~ As co-producer, master multi-instrumentalist, and composer, Jesse is pure joy and wild fun to work with. On Turkish baglama and cura saz, oud, drumkit, percussion, flute, and string arrangements, you'll hear his sultry, sinuous, and spicy grace-notes all over this album... <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>JAMES HOSKINS</b> ~ The last and perhaps most evocative musician to be recorded, James has lent his unearthly cello on several pieces. James' playing goes straight to the heart, sending it to the stars. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>WADE EVANS</b> ~ The rumours are true: Wade Evans is a superhuman instrumentalist! By a fluke of travel and holiday schedules, all his recording got crammed into one day, and we recorded all his classical guitar and oud in one 18 hour stretch at Immersive Studios. He plays on every song, and beautifully! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>SCOTT BEARS</b> Scott has been one of my most dedicated musicians for several years now, and it tickles me beyond belief to have gotten him back to his roots: rockin out on electric guitar. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>AHARON BOLSTA</b> ~ Groove-meister #1, Aharon plays impeccable drumkit, spirited Indian tabla, and vivacious Mideast doumbek. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>DAVID ALDERDICE</b> ~ Groove-meister #2, David lends his soulful drumkit grooves on a number of songs. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>JARED MAY</b> ~ Slinky, deep, and soulful, Jared May on bass brings the heavens down to earth and keeps our hips in play. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>TIERRO LEE</b> ~ This fine gentleman, engineer, and producer was at the helm in the very beginning, and it is due to his impeccable touch that the foundation of this album is so solid and clear. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>MEAGAN CHANDLER</b> ~ Meagan lends her shimmering high-notes and spicy flamenco palmas on a couple songs, and has been by my [often virtual] side every step of the way, advising me on the arrangements, instruments, artwork, and every matter of the heart (producing an album is an emotional and spiritual journey as well as an artistic one!). <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>TIM GENNERT</b> ~ Three-time Grammy nominee mastering engineer, Tim has some of the best ears in the business, and is lending them toward the final polishing touch of mastering.<br/>
</li>
<li>
And also thanks to: <b>ADRIENNE SHORT</b> ~ Violin, <b>JENNA WOODS</b> ~ Finger cymbals, and <b>CHARLIE PARKER &amp; DIK DARNELL</b> ~ Additional recording engineering.  This has truly been a community endeavor, and I'm so happy for all the wonderful folks involved.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>TOM HAST</b> ~ This man has harbored me, encouraged me, and asked all the best challenging questions at all the right times. My work has been honed and uplifted in the fires of his friendship. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>BRENT 'HAFIZ' MATHIEU</b> ~ We couldn't have done anything without Brent's belief and support. He kickstarted the project, and has championed it every step of the way! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>GUILLAUME 'WILDCAT'</b> ~ Not many photographers would come out on the ocean cliffs with me in a freezing cold windstorm to shoot the cover art - it takes a fearless and adventuresome soul to follow my wild whims - but Guillaume was up to the task!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>YOU!!</b> ~ Dearhearts ~ this project is alive entirely because you've championed it! I couldn't have done this without your support, and it is my hope it gives back a hundredfold with its medicine...

<p>I've created this album because I believe these songs hold important keys to unlocking and healing our human hearts. The lyrics, melodies, and instrumentation evoke reminders of the oft-forgotten deeper and mystical sides of life, the deep well from which <i>Soul</i> is drawn. Additionally, in working with elements and instruments from traditional music from around the world, it is my hope to both honor the gifts of our many human heritages, and help weave a richly textured future that draws upon the wealth of these very roots.</p>

<b>MAIDEN OF MIDNIGHT</b> ~ The title track, this song has a decidedly Celtic feel, and is a prayer for all our ""journeys home."" <i>""Ancient Woman, Maiden of Midnight, sing us your mystery song / And gypsy dancer, of the fire and moonlight, won't you bring us along / On your way, on your way home..."" </i>
</li>

<li>
<b>DANCE OF THE STARS</b> ~ To free our gypsy spirits! Sing and dance along to this Turkish-inspired festive piece... <i>""Ride the sky... a light... on fire!""</i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>DESERT BLOOMS</b> ~ A beautiful and graceful fusion of Celtic and Indian musical elements, with even a touch of classic rock, the prayer is that we return to right-relation with the earth, and find soulful freedom in our hearts. <i>""And we are wild as the wind, as we caress the earth and sky / And we are lovers of this land, and love is all that's left in time..."" </i>
</li>
<li>
<b>PHOENIX</b> ~ A raucous and incisive Mideast-inspired rhythmic song that asks us to live boldly! <i>""If you were to fall, finally surrender, who would you be now?"" </i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>LA ROSA ENFLORECE</b> ~ A heart-wrenching Sephardic love song with Spanish and Mideast Flavorings. <i>""The nightingales are singing, sighs of love...""</i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>KALI'S ARMY</b> ~ With this song we enter the cauldron of transformation, that we may be freed from the binds that constrict us, into the wild grace of the sweet mystery... <i>""And I'm bound in this garden...is watered with tears / Turn back ye demons, I've conquered your fears!"" </i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>INTO THE VOID</b> ~ Letting go, we surrender to the unknown. This song is an exotic dive into the mystic ocean... <i>""Into the void I travel / Into the shadows I fall / Into the silent thunder / Into nothing, and all...""</i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>RAVEN</b> ~ Uplifting, playful and rhythmic, this song celebrates the rich freedom that comes with letting go. Having known both darkness and light, we find the joy within both, surrendering to fly free... <i>""Essence of blackness / Silence of night / Stillness embodied, fall into flight, fall into flight...""</i><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>ESPERANZA</b> ~ A Spanish-inspired original song with fusion elements from the Celts to the Mideast... <i>""Respira la Esperanza, con la fuerza del espiritu..."" </i>May our spirits be strong as we breathe in...<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>ANGELFIRE</b> ~ Accompanied by the shimmering sounds of the cura saz, the album ends on a celestial and dreamy note... <i>""Black waves of night pour through me / Stars of the ocean, tumbling sky...""</i><br/>

If you're just arriving here, welcome to read on if you're interested to know about the backstory of the album and the campaign that pushed it over the brink...

NOVEMBER 18, 2014: Thousands of gypsy miles later, my debut album stands on the threshold of completion! I have arrived in Los Angeles and am in the studio with Tina Malia in final mixing! The artwork is designed, the last grace-notes recorded, and I am excited and ready to let this out into the world! But in order to do that, I need to clear one final financial hump ~ or as I've been saying, like any good birth this just needs one final push!
And that's where you come in...  I ran the initial fundraiser for this album exactly two years ago ~ and though very successful, I knew we would need more funding when the time came to finish it.  Since then I've toured significantly, meeting many new friends and fans ~ so I simply wanted to offer the same perks I did back then for those who didn't get to partake the first time.  Oh yes, and there's a couple extra goodies you might notice in the perk-list for you longtime supporters and super-fans... ;-)  Additionally, take note that the Pre-release is an Exclusive Fan-Release ONLY! The public release will be a month later ~ so in order to assure that you don't have to wait, this is the best way to pre-order your album!
Oh yeah, and did I mention that the album is simply beautiful, danceable, sensuous, entrancing, and somewhat spicy and fun?!  The musicians and producers who have lent their masterful touch have been impeccable and inspiring ~ this has been a hugely collective effort, and it shines with the vibrancy of my virtuosic musical tribe ~ not to mention the power-packed team of advisors and supporters (and yes, that includes YOU!).  I love these people and couldn't have done it without them... 
Scroll down to read about the musicians, the instruments, the songs themselves..., and help me bring this beautiful, mystical album to completion and into your hearts and hands! 
I am SO EXCITED to share this beautiful music with you!
