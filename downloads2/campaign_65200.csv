<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Did you know that a typical home insurance does not have enough coverage to rebuild your home, replace your expensive personal property or protect your property from perils in the event of a major disaster? Imagine all these years of paying the premium only to realize that it wasn't enough to get a fresh start, <strong>defeating the very purpose of having an insurance</strong>.</p>
<p>Insu<i>Scribe </i>is a Smart Insurance Bot on a mobile AI platform being developed by Samuh, Inc. that automatically analyzes your home/renter insurance coverage, identifies the coverage gaps and works seamlessly with you and your insurance provider to minimize these gaps and provide you peace of mind on your home coverage!!!  </p>
<p>Any significant change in the cost to rebuild your home or replacement value of your personal property or other gaps that would impact your home and property insurance is automatically reflected back as a change in your coverage that you can choose to accept or reject on your mobile device.</p>
<p>Existing insurance solutions require the consumer to process and understand their insurance policies and the gaps. Not only is understanding these gaps extremely research oriented and time consuming but then finding an insurance solution that minimizes these gaps and monitoring it continuously to ensure the gaps continue to be minimized requires constant analysis and action by the consumer. Even though the insurance companies make annual adjustments to cover these gaps, the adjustments are not enough and do not account for all the changes that would impact your insurance coverage. The end result is that consumers do not have enough coverage to rebuild their homes or replace their personal property or protect them from other casualties in an event of a major disaster. The burden is on the consumer to fix this!</p>
<p>This is where Insu<i>Scribe</i> comes into play! The ultimate goal is to take away the consumer burden and have a solution that proactively and automatically takes action to minimize under-insurance and needless premiums and work with your or another insurance provider to ensure the necessary coverage to protect your property. You, the consumer, no longer have to constantly worry about updating your insurance coverage and have the proactive <i>Scribe</i> to work for you!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to (1) reach the consumer (2) make them aware of the problem and the required solution and (3) sign up the consumer to make this campaign and solution successful. You will get free access to full capabilities of Insu<i>Scribe</i> and/or other Bots launched by Samuh, Inc. depending on the perk chosen.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Recent natural disasters (Dorian Hurricane, California Wildfires and others) have inflicted tremendous damage to the homes and have shown that majority of homes are under insured. The insurance claim dollars based on your coverage have not been sufficient to rebuild homes or replace the personal property lost in the disaster. <strong>The homeowners are living a nightmare settling their lives.</strong></p>
<p>Insu<i>Scribe's</i> mission is to automatically detect and eliminate this insurance coverage gap and provide meaningful coverage by proactively working with your insurance provider.</p>
<p>At Samuh, our vision is to simplify consumer life by aggregating your data and making the impact where it makes the most difference starting with your home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Insu<i>Scribe</i> works by aggregating certain data from you. For example, if you purchase a $5000 jewelry, we would automatically work with your insurance provider and provide an insurance quote for your acceptance or decline. If you just got a pet, then we will notify you of any liability coverage gaps you may have with your current insurance and work with your insurance provider and provide a quote for your acceptance or decline. This can be all automated unlike solutions that exist today. Of course, we will share any of this information only if you authorize us to do so. Another example, is adjusting the insurance coverage based on rebuild cost in your area or maintaining inventory of all your personal property along with its replacement value and managing your insurance premium based on these accurate datapoint or providing access to your insurance provider in the event of a disaster for quicker claim resolution.</p>
<p>Not only are the premiums based on your true inventory and its value but also it becomes easier for the insurance companies to process your claims quickly since the chances of fraud reduce drastically. No longer, do insurance companies need to struggle with your claim that you did own the $2000 watch that got destroyed in the fire as they will have the detail if you choose to share it with them.</p>
<p>Outside of typical development risks, the biggest risk for us is being able to get your approval to access the relevant data. Another big risk is in engaging the Insurance Providers which can be mitigated if we have you, the consumer, on board. Even though the Insurance Providers see a lot of value with the information being pulled together that will help them prevent fraud claims, there will be a risk in executing these partnerships.</p>
<p>Our principles are very simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain Consumer Privacy</li>
<li>Data Security without violating Consumer Privacy by deploying military grade encryption</li>
<li>100% Consumer controlled sharing</li>
<li>Proactive and Excellent User Experience</li>
</ul>
<p>Our hope is that the above values will give you comfort to share this information with us and simplify some of your lifestyle problems.​</p>

<p><strong>WHAT YOU DON’T SEE WON’T BURN YOU</strong></p>
<p>Integrating your existing kitchen model with futuristic technology, Invisacook is specifically designed to defy conventional visual expectations and enhance your overall counter space. Whether you’re looking to install it in your home, in an RV, or on a boat, Invisacook will be there to ensure you’re capable of cooking safely and optimally. In effect, subjecting yourself to the tough decision between functionality or alluring design in your kitchen space is all but a thing of the past.</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p>Invisacook is installed beneath your countertop. Using advanced invisa-induction technology, it works through your countertop to effectively heat the surface and create an adequate cooking space where there might not traditionally appear to be one. Additionally, as the Invisacook does not generate direct heat, it remains safe to use as traditional counter space when you’re not cooking.</p>
<p><strong>MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE</strong></p>
<p>Invisacook isn’t just faster than both traditional gas or electric-powered stovetops, but it’s also one of the safest possible cooktops to have in your home.  Because it remains mildly warm to the touch, you’ll feel more confident and assured moving around your kitchen with a reduced risk for heat-related burns. Thus, its invisibility remains a primary strength and not a cause for concern.</p>
<p><strong>INVISACOOK CAN BE USED UNDER A VARIETY OF SURFACE MATERIALS.</strong><br/>- Granite<br/>- Porcelain<br/>- Ceramic<br/>- Ultra Compact Surfaces</p>

ELIAH heats and lights up every room, which you don’t want to have heated all the time.  Or rooms where you desire it to be extra warm. 
Cosy and warm in an instant.Regarding installation, operation or heating – compared to water-conducting radiators, ELIAH wins in every discipline. End inconvenient and cumbersome heating of rarely used rooms. Put on fast heat by ELIAH!  
Wellbeing without renovation.Existing ceiling lights can easily be replaced by ELIAH, this will only take minutes. And ELIAH works with your standard light switch, it really does! The maximum current consumption can be set to fit usual circuit breakers.  
Bright light with pleasant colour.ELIAH features natural colours and good contrast thanks to high quality Osram-LEDs. A beautiful warm-white light-colour of 2700°K and a colour rendering index of 80+ will give you superb lighting. You can set and select up to six individual brightness settings from 10% to 100%.

Immediately utilisableELIAH is a ceiling mounted device and therefore immediately utilisable. Forget about old and dusty mobile heaters. ELIAH needs no app and no remote control!  
More space and freedom.The elimination of mobile heating solutions leaves more space in your rooms. Trip hazards such as extension cords or multi-outlet power sockets are gone, too.  
Your desired temperature.ELIAH eliminates inaccurate bimetallic thermostats or pointless min/max labels by storing up to six individual temperatures, accurate to the degree. Of course, you can switch between Degree Celsius and Fahrenheit, no need to do any math.Equipped with a silent fan, driven by a brushless motor, ELIAH circulates air very silent, even when your temperature has been reached. So it can continiously measure the temperature and react fast on even little temperature drops.  
Comprehensive safety.ELIAH detects temperatures in a fail-safe manner, electric circuits are protected redundantly. The installation on the ceiling prevents the supply and exhaust air from being obstructed. A timed and automatic switch off ensures the safe operation of ELIAH.  
Energy-saving and reliable.ELIAH uses efficient LEDs, monitors the room temperature precisely and switches off the heating automatically after a predefined time. Therefore, ELIAH is remarkably safe and environmentally friendly. No more overheated rooms or forgotten electrical heaters.

The mechanical design has been discussed with specialists for squeeze casting and only needs small adjustments.As you can see, our prototypes already received serious attention and we did real streamlining. Still there might be the need for minor changes in the design to guarantee you the best experience. So we are a 100% convinced to bring ELIAH to you, with all its features, just as promised. Our next steps:After a successful campaign we will immediately start certification process and make the final selection of our suppliers. But we need to have some time to do the right choices, so please understand that we do not try to bring ELIAH this year. We use crowdfunding in the very original manner and it is not just a marketing tool for us.We will also slowly rise production numbers, to guarantee the best possible quality for you! Timeline: THANK YOU!Thank you for your interest in ELIAH and LIQUIDBEAM. We hope our presentation of ELIAH convinced you from its benefits. Support us and spread the word! Support us and tell your family and friends about it. We would be very happy. Use the included functions of INDIEGOGO to share the idea of ELIAH.Give eight quarters or more. Support us with any amount above 2 dollars you would like to give.After a successful campaign, we will share the list of all supporters on our website, and of course we are very thankful for that.

</div></div>","Orca Helix can be lowered to 10"" off the ground - Sitting ergonomically, means sitting lower; it is healthier to position yourself low, to reduce the chances of colorectal disorders, haemorrhoids, constipation, and is much healthier during pregnancy and more hygienic.
It can be adjusted up to 21"" off the ground - making it urinal height, so no more missed shots, no more messes!
Be lifted or lowered - capable of aiding you getting off, whether you have bad knees, muscle pain or bad back.

Orca Helix's has built in bidet - you can be clean and save trees, not only water! You will be able to control this hygienic feature via your phone, or a knob on the left hand side of the bowl.

Maelstrom Flush is an innovative patented flush technology which will use significantly less water than traditional toilet. The flush is a two stage system, which flushes and also rinses it efficiently and effectively. 

Orca Helix has bluetooth/wifi capabilities - control all functions and pre set all your seating/standing arrangements before you even walk into the bathroom, and be in control while you're in it.

Orca Helix comes with built in speakers, so whether you’re taking a bath or just need some entertainment while getting ready to go to work or out, you can now have Orca entertain you with your playlist.

Orca Helix has a sensitive night light that activates in the darkness. With Orca Helix you can use your restroom without turning the light on, which makes sure that there will be no disruption in your melatonin production.

The Lids will clean and sanitize the seat - be germ free with our innovative lid, and while the seat is being cleaned and sanitized, your bowl is being hit with UV light.
THE ORCA TEAM
We are an efficient and prolific team of five individuals from across the globe that came together because of the belief in project, and the impact Orca will make. Each one of us brings a unique skill to make this project a reality. 
 
Lokesh Reddy has had formal mechanical engineering training and his skills are 3D printer utilization and his former experience at Hindustan Aeronautics and Lisi Aerospace put him as an expert in selecting, calculating and testing gear ratios, motor components, and also water and air sealing specialist. His experience as a product development engineer & responsibilities for developing the manufacturing process for new products, made his experience a valued asset at Entijs Canada inc. 

Vancho Stoev, our design engineer has formal training as a mechanical engineer in Macedonia, he is our 3D software drawing expert.
His expertise and in-depth knowledge of the softwares unique features, gave us an advantage in cutting time, and costs by running simulations before we brought the design to real world environment. Jure Korber is our Electrical engineer and he possess multiple degreees Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering, Bachelors in Science, and Master in Engineering.  Jure designed Orca’s PCB’s and took part in programming some of the logic for Orca. His past experience includes with Skyris drone, Stay Safe Aviation Fail Safe Systems, and uFBD Pharmaceutical devices, and many more. Ivan Gochko, the founder of Entijs and creator of Orca, has his own cause invested into this vision. The vision to have adjustable height toilet accessible to those that need it most, the ones that need the independence which some of us take for granted. His Experience in running a construction business for several years, gave Ivan intimate knowledge of how city & house drainage and plumbing system works, by seeing it built from the ground up.
Our Mission!
Our goal with Orca Helix is to produce a product that brings people closer to our natural roots/ways through technological advancement. This means healthier posture during natures calls seatings, and cleaner and more hygienic environment, and of course more sustainability too.

Featured in:

Where did the idea come from?
The idea for Ivan was revolving for years prior to having his construction business, and before his mishap of being temporarily immobile due to a fracture on his foot. Living with his father and ill mother, as a teenager he understood the importance of a facility that was needed for individuals with disabilities.

Once the conception of the actual idea, this disability is what drove Ivan’s passion. Orca Helix is a simplified representation of the original Orca, made for individuals with mobility issues:


Orca Helix is the ideal product Ivan saw as the product he’d want to see in his bathroom. The functions are the result of Ivan’s personal everyday research he did in the special research room we all have at home.
How it works! 
The Lid's:

The Sanitizing Flush: 
Maelstrom Flush is an innovative patented flush technology which will use significantly less water than traditional toilet. The flush is a two stage system, first the larger water openings inside 
the bowl cavities are activated and the water rushes in to flush everything, and then the small openings are activated via a separate valve, and in effect creates a jet stream that rinses the entire bowl, and cleans it efficiently and effectively.",45.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>People are tired of sleeping on stiff sheets. Sure, “Egyptian Cotton” gets softer as you wash it… apparently… but who wants to wash their sheets a bunch of times, wasting a bunch of water, just to make their sheets comfortable? The secret to producing Naked Sheet’s sorbet-soft feel was finding the optimal thread (500) and combining it with finer quality threads. We only use fine yarn of 80s x 60s count. Most bed sheets on the market use 60s x 40s yarn count.</p>

The water evaporates from the material humidifying the air. Our material has increased specific evaporation area and improved capillary effect (effect of fluid lifting through thin tubes) that allows evaWAVE to humidify the air better than competitors.</p><h3>What does the humidifying effect depend on?</h3><p>The humidifying effect depends on two factors: the outside air temperature, the air humidity. The working principle of our products is based on the evaporation process. The higher the temperature and the lower the humidity is, the more actively the evaporation occurs, leading to a greater humidifying effect.</p><p>The last factor that influences the humidity change is the turbine speed. By adjusting it, you can choose the most comfortable humidification intensity for you.</p><h3>How to install evaWAVE?</h3><p>evaWAVE is very easy to use and is ready to operate right out of the box. All you need to do is fill the water tank, open the aroma cartridge, plug in the device and turn it on, then set up the app control. The water tank needs to be refilled every 6-8 hours as the water evaporates. You can use the device with or without the aroma cartridge, the usage of your own aromatic oils or essences is also possible with the empty aroma cartridge that has to be purchased from us. You can find more detailed instructions on using evaWAVE in the box.</p><p>evaWAVE has 1 year warranty. In case of a breakdown, contact our support service at: <a href=""http://support.evapolar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support.evapolar.com</a></p><h3>Does evaWAVE work without a power supply?</h3><p>When using the Evapolar air humidifier, please make sure you connect the device to a 220V/110V power supply.</p><h3>How do I know it’s time to replace the cartridge? Do I need to buy an extra cartridge right now?</h3><p>You need to replace the cartridge at least every 4-6 months. The cartridge lifespan depends on the air and water quality.</p><h3>Does shipping costs include taxes?</h3><p>Unfortunately, taxes vary from country to country and Indiegogo platform doesn't allow to charge them. So, please take into consideration tax payment rules and import laws in your country when making a contribution.</p></div>","There is a constant struggle between ultrasonic and evaporative humidifiers.

They are always ready to provide you with any desired information. Don't hesitate to contact us via ""Ask a question"" at the top of the page. For press inquiries reach us at pr@evapolar.com With your help, we have already launched two successful products that embody the concept of personal microclimate. We received a lot of feedback on our evaLIGHT™ and evaSMART™ air coolers and returned to Indiegogo for the third time with a room humidifying solution. Support us and keep shaping the future of personal microclimate with us! How does evaWAVE humidify the air?Our air humidifier works on evaporative principle. The water evaporates from the material humidifying the air. Our material has increased specific evaporation area and improved capillary effect (effect of fluid lifting through thin tubes) that allows evaWAVE to humidify the air better than competitors.What does the humidifying effect depend on?The humidifying effect depends on two factors: the outside air temperature, the air humidity. The working principle of our products is based on the evaporation process. The higher the temperature and the lower the humidity is, the more actively the evaporation occurs, leading to a greater humidifying effect.The last factor that influences the humidity change is the turbine speed. By adjusting it, you can choose the most comfortable humidification intensity for you.How to install evaWAVE?evaWAVE is very easy to use and is ready to operate right out of the box. All you need to do is fill the water tank, open the aroma cartridge, plug in the device and turn it on, then set up the app control. The water tank needs to be refilled every 6-8 hours as the water evaporates. You can use the device with or without the aroma cartridge, the usage of your own aromatic oils or essences is also possible with the empty aroma cartridge that has to be purchased from us. You can find more detailed instructions on using evaWAVE in the box.evaWAVE has 1 year warranty. In case of a breakdown, contact our support service at: support.evapolar.comDoes evaWAVE work without a power supply?When using the Evapolar air humidifier, please make sure you connect the device to a 220V/110V power supply.How do I know it’s time to replace the cartridge? Do I need to buy an extra cartridge right now?You need to replace the cartridge at least every 4-6 months. The cartridge lifespan depends on the air and water quality.Does shipping costs include taxes?Unfortunately, taxes vary from country to country and Indiegogo platform doesn't allow to charge them. So, please take into consideration tax payment rules and import laws in your country when making a contribution.",29.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h4>American model only?</h4>
<div>Actually, the Lumino smartplug is design for American standard plug. We are working to develop an European plug but is not ready yet.  Maybe it will work with adapters, but we can't guarantee anything.<br/>
</div>
</div>
<h4>What is the range of Lumino?</h4>
<p>We use latest Bluetooth technology (BLE 4.1). This means 50 feet of range including going through walls, enough to cover almost every home.</p>
<h4>How many alarms can I set per Lumino?</h4>
<p>The app can support up to 10
different alarms per Lumino. An alarm is defined as a change of intensity over
a period of time with a backup sound or not. You can decide to repeat the alarm
throughout the week or to select the days you want it to ring or not. For
example, you can set an alarm for your work, one for the night and another for
the weekend. </p>
<h4>Can I turn off the phone for the night? Can I use it in Airplane mode?</h4>
<p>When you want to program a
plug, you need your phone with the Bluetooth activated. Once you have program
the plug, you no longer need a connection with it except if you want a sudden
change. For the backup sound alarm, you must keep you phone ON and the Lumino
app on foreground for iOS app. We suggest using the phone stand to show the
time or you can put the phone face down and the screen will turn OFF. You must
not close the screen with the side button. You can use airplane mode with no
problem. Android version is more flexible.</p>
<h4>Can I lock my phone's screen?</h4>
<p>You will
turn off the backup sound alarm if you lock the screen. It’s only a concern on
iOS version. But we are working on it as we speak for the next app update :)</p>
<h4>How many Lumino may I control with a single phone?</h4>
<p>You can pair your app with
a maximum of 10 Lumino.</p>
<h4>Can I control a Lumino with different phones? What
if someone else also want to control it?</h4>
<p>A Lumino can be paired with
several phones. For example you could set the alarm one day and the next day someone
else could do it. Each time someone programs a new alarm, it will erase all
pending alarms set by another device. We have also the possibility to add a
password to a device to keep the control of it.</p>
<h4>How can I be ensure my lamp won't respond to a nearby device that is not my own?</h4>
<p>You can add
a password to lock it from undesirable user. If you forget the password, you
can simply unplug it for an hour and you will be able to connect to it again.</p>
<h4>Which kind of bulb I can use?</h4>
<p>Any kind of dimmable bulb: incandescent, Dimmable LED, Dimmable CFL, Halogen, …</p>
<h4>What happens in the event of power outage during the
night?</h4>
<p>No worries! Even without
light, your phone will still ring when it's time to wake up! Lumino also has backup power just in case.</p>
<h4>Which Bluetooth protocol version is used?</h4>
<p>Bluetooth Smart 4.1</p>
<h4>What's the maximum power output? Can I control
several lamps with a single Lumino?</h4>
<p>Lumino is rated for 240W. We
suggest to use an extension to control both your beside lamp to get the best dawn/dusk
simulation experience or relaxation session.</p>
<h4>What it the relaxation session?</h4>
<p>During the relaxation session, the lamp connected to your lumino device will brighten and dim at a pre-determined rhythm for the duration of the session. By matching your breathing with the rhythm set by the gentle light, you will enter a state of relaxation that will facilitate slumber. The sessions are based on yoga breathing exercises and help to relieve stress at the end of your busy day.</p>
<h4>How do I get the app? Is the app free to use?</h4>
<p>The Lumino Smartplug app will
be available for free in the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sleepcompanion/id942993883?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>App
Store</span></a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.holimotion.android.sleepcompanion&amp;hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Google
Play</span></a>.</p>
<h4>How long is the warranty?</h4>
<p>Warranty is 1 year.</p>
<h4>Should I use LED instead of incandescent bulb? Is
there any science behind that lighting solution?</h4>
<p>Blue light from cold LED
bulb are the best solution for an efficient wake up. Studies show that the
impact of blue light on the concentration of melatonin, the sleep hormone, has
been proven in several scientific studies. Conventional bulbs also have an effect on these hormones, but less than LED. Research on the effects of light on
human body is still a pretty new field of investigation. Yet we've seen more
and more research work published in the recent years to include the Harvard
Medicine School, the NASA and several sleep centers though Europe.<br/></p>

Can I turn off the phone for the night? Can I use it in Airplane mode?
When you want to program a
plug, you need your phone with the Bluetooth activated. Once you have program
the plug, you no longer need a connection with it except if you want a sudden
change. For the backup sound alarm, you must keep you phone ON and the Lumino
app on foreground for iOS app. We suggest using the phone stand to show the
time or you can put the phone face down and the screen will turn OFF. You must
not close the screen with the side button. You can use airplane mode with no
problem. Android version is more flexible.
Can I lock my phone's screen?
You will
turn off the backup sound alarm if you lock the screen. It’s only a concern on
iOS version. But we are working on it as we speak for the next app update :)
How many Lumino may I control with a single phone?
You can pair your app with
a maximum of 10 Lumino.
Can I control a Lumino with different phones? What
if someone else also want to control it?
A Lumino can be paired with
several phones. For example you could set the alarm one day and the next day someone
else could do it. Each time someone programs a new alarm, it will erase all
pending alarms set by another device. We have also the possibility to add a
password to a device to keep the control of it.
How can I be ensure my lamp won't respond to a nearby device that is not my own?
You can add
a password to lock it from undesirable user. If you forget the password, you
can simply unplug it for an hour and you will be able to connect to it again.
Which kind of bulb I can use?
Any kind of dimmable bulb: incandescent, Dimmable LED, Dimmable CFL, Halogen, …
What happens in the event of power outage during the
night?
No worries! Even without
light, your phone will still ring when it's time to wake up! Lumino also has backup power just in case.
Which Bluetooth protocol version is used?
Bluetooth Smart 4.1
What's the maximum power output? Can I control
several lamps with a single Lumino?
Lumino is rated for 240W. We
suggest to use an extension to control both your beside lamp to get the best dawn/dusk
simulation experience or relaxation session.
What it the relaxation session?
During the relaxation session, the lamp connected to your lumino device will brighten and dim at a pre-determined rhythm for the duration of the session. By matching your breathing with the rhythm set by the gentle light, you will enter a state of relaxation that will facilitate slumber. The sessions are based on yoga breathing exercises and help to relieve stress at the end of your busy day.
How do I get the app? Is the app free to use?
The Lumino Smartplug app will
be available for free in the App
Store and Google
Play.
How long is the warranty?
Warranty is 1 year.
Should I use LED instead of incandescent bulb? Is
there any science behind that lighting solution?
Blue light from cold LED
bulb are the best solution for an efficient wake up. Studies show that the
impact of blue light on the concentration of melatonin, the sleep hormone, has
been proven in several scientific studies. Conventional bulbs also have an effect on these hormones, but less than LED. Research on the effects of light on
human body is still a pretty new field of investigation. Yet we've seen more
and more research work published in the recent years to include the Harvard
Medicine School, the NASA and several sleep centers though Europe.",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

What We Need & What You Get:

The Project calls for $49,500 for tooling and the first 1750 piece production run.  Tooling is expensive for plastic injection molding, and the QuadCooker--microwave assistant--has three unique parts that require tooling: 1) The Base Plate, 2) the Walls (one tool makes both walls), and 3) the plate/shelves.  Each $23 contribution gets you 1 Base, 2 Walls, and 3 Plate/Shelves (one complete Quadcooker unit!)
We are offering the first edition QuadCooker as a perk to the first 1750 backers!!
  In the unlikely event we do not reach our goal all investments will be returned to the backers

Risks & Challenges
 With my MBA and long career in sales the most challenging aspect of the project has been finding the right professional resources to bring my concept to fruition and to protect the intellectual property:

Working with the designer for several weeks tirelessly enabled me to move from concept to a prototype reality!
With the concept ""on paper"" the next logical step was to build a professional prototype. Fortunately I was able to work directly with a local 3-d printing company to produce the model seen in the above video

<p>Having seen my own child be the victim of a crush injury, I know how devastating it can be. Things you previously never dreamed could hurt you, are now front and center.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me, because I feel we can prevent crush injuries. Over 40000 hospital visits a year show just how dangerous things in your own home can be . Having the backing of our contributors will allow us to greatly reduce the number of injuries in the home, with the added benefit of saving your electronics from permanent loss.</p>

<p>Given that TVs are very heavy they are prone to fall over if bumped or pushed, this could be by a child, pet or even an adult. This could not only be costly, but fatal.</p>

</div></div>","Having seen my own child be the victim of a crush injury, I know how devastating it can be. Things you previously never dreamed could hurt you, are now front and center.
This campaign is important to me, because I feel we can prevent crush injuries. Over 40000 hospital visits a year show just how dangerous things in your own home can be . Having the backing of our contributors will allow us to greatly reduce the number of injuries in the home, with the added benefit of saving your electronics from permanent loss.
 

 
The Atlas TV Safety Bar was developed to provide additional support for flat screen TVs that are mounted on their factory supplied feet.
 

 
Given that TVs are very heavy they are prone to fall over if bumped or pushed, this could be by a child, pet or even an adult. This could not only be costly, but fatal.
 
Using a combination of vacuum, polymers and micro-adjustment, Atlas brings a new dimension to stability .
 

 
Its unique structure means its suitable for heavy-duty use, is transferable, strong, and reliable.
 
If you have a flatscreen, and don’t have it wall mounted, Atlas will add the peace of mind you didn’t even know you needed.
 
Given the adjustability of the bar, it can be used to stabilize monitors, desktop computer towers and many other items that can come loose and become a danger.

</div></div>","It is a portable projector but works like a smartphone. Charge it and Play it instantly. Guaranteed delivery worldwide Most of the ""Full HD"" mobile projectors are not really Full HD. If you take a close look at the specs, the resolution of a typical mobile projector is ""WVGA: 480p"" and even the “high-performance” projectors are ""HD: 720p."" This was the technical limit of the mobile projector...Until NOW!D029 is able to go beyond the technical limit, and successfully materialize crystal clear Full HD: 1080p quality!


                      
 


With D029, you can enjoy sharp and crisp images even with this large display.

If the brightness of a projector is low, the image will be dot-like, rough and dim when its enlarged. But D029 produces 200 ANSI Lumens to ensure the picture is clear with for any screen size from 20-200 inches.

 
 

Hold your popcorn tight because everything will look real! The awesome quality of 3D will take you right into the movie. (3D viewing glasses are sold separately)

The D029 is extremely lightweight and easy to carry anywhere! It’s only 850 grams (29.9 ounces) and smaller than a water bottle. It’s time to carry the Smart Mobile Projector! Your business meeting will go smoothly with the versatile D029, and your movie day or game time with your family and friends will be a blast!

We collaborated with HOTTACK, a PCBA solutions company specializing in smart android electronic product design, hardware & software engineering, manufacturing, and sales with more than 11 years of core research and development contract as the second developer of Rockship. We have acquired ISO 9001-2015, SG, and BSCI quality standards that meet international standards.

We found D029 at the Hong Kong Electronics Fair and it was a prototype at the time.  We create video contents so we examined the D029 strictly whether the performance is not good, or the native image quality is actually low. Out of all the mobile projectors at the fair and what we have seen, D029 was the far best in quality and function. We decided to invest in D029 and take it to the next level!

Our hands have the capability to carry and pass on millions of germs per handshake, that's why frequently washing hands is important! However, in between our handwashing, we come into contact with many high-touch surfaces, one of the dirtiest of all being door handles. Research has shown that door handles can carry over 1,300 types of germs and bacteria. That's where UVWAY comes in, minimizing that spread and keeping everyone safe is our main priority. By using an automatic sensor the UVWAY turns on its built-in UV-C light for 10-30 seconds killing off any harmful pathogens present on the surface.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624361642/ked8fdpqb8jtjshyzuju.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623985038/yu2q3ekl40jdtrqsudtu.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624345028/lajm31zd1o2cqsoykq0t.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.wixstatic.com/media/fb9956_a14dec6805b64170a3d15dcb15afb585~mv2.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624559696/zmrsgdjgdhsoqzeds7i6.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624371654/mo5zpiuxa6gjdqjnqncg.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Often forgotten about, door handles lead as one of the five dirtiest surfaces in a home. The CDC urges to wipe down high-touched surfaces frequently. However, after every use is wasteful and not possible in busier places such as businesses or restaurants.

Research has also shown we enter our homes and bathrooms with hands that could be carrying up to 10 million germs that can linger for hours. Although brass or copper door handles are used for their antimicrobial properties, new research has found that it becomes less effective from layers of human sweat after extended use and requires a minimum of a few hours to kill germs.

<h2>Buy One Give One Initiative</h2>
<p>The Buy One Give One initiative is not as much about charity as it is about having compassion for ourselves and others. With every purchase of a Smile Vial, one will be given to someone in need of a little kindness. Kindness matters and sometimes even the simplest of random acts of kindness can have a profound effect, far beyond that which was intended. But, that's only the beginning.</p><p>In time, I aim to broaden the reach and impact of the project by supporting various charitable organizations with proceeds from Smile Vial sales.  There is no shortage of causes in desperate need of funding and social entrepreneurship is one of the most financially sustainable ways to support them.  The Smile Vial project is committed to a mandate of positive social benefit.  Portion of the proceeds from every Smile Vial sale will always be allocated towards supporting worthwhile social initiatives for as long as Smile Vials are being sold.  I started this project with that specific objective in mind.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Perks &amp; Rewards</h2>
<p>The Smile Vial is designed to last. The vial will be made of polypropylene so it won’t break if you drop it. It will be available in a variety of colors starting with frosted clear, graphite, and magenta as shown below. The top holder will be made using a soft elastomer to make it nicer to hold and to prevent it from slipping. A neodymium (aka rare earth) magnet, encased in the holder, will secure the Smile Vial to any ferromagnetic metal surface, including some stainless steels. The note insert is a thin polymer film. It will be supplied blank so you can write on it with any marker and reuse it for as long as you want.</p>
<p>The art board is a plain 5 x 7 inch anti-corrosion coated metal surface. It comes with a magnetic strip so you can stick it to other metal surfaces such as your fridge. You can also hang it just about anywhere you’d like using readily available fasteners. Lastly, it conveniently fits standard photo frames so you can match it to your existing décor.</p>

<p><strong>The Smile Vial Set</strong> comes with three vials of the same color. You’ll be able to choose one of three colors (frosted, graphite, magenta) but you don’t have to decide now. Final selection can be made once you receive the backer survey at the end of the campaign.</p>

The Smile Vial is a tiny magnetic vase for flowers and small plants. It’s designed to make good things happen. For every one bought, one will be given away to someone in need of a little kindness in their life.
Many different ways to add a bit of nature to your space with the Smile Vial.
Smile Vial is all about creating smiles, starting with your very own. As science continues to show us, nature has an incredibly positive impact on our well being. Making a conscious effort to look for and celebrate all the little beautiful things around you is a simple and easy behavior that leads to a greater sense of gratitude. Making it a regular part of your life can have a profound effect.
Use Smile Vial with any cut flowers.
The Smile Vial was designed to require minimal effort. One or two small flowers at a time is all it requires and they’re easy to find. In addition, small succulents or tillandsia plants are easy to grow in the Smile Vials. It’s all beautifully simple.
Grow low maintenance succulents and tillandsia plants.
Add personal touches to appliances.
Stick to any ferromagnetic metal surface.
Use metal screws or thumbtacks to add Smile Vial to furniture.
Add personal touches to any piece of furniture.
Convert existing fixtures to beautiful floral displays.
 Greet or surprise loved ones with beautiful floral arrangements.
The Smile Vial will also allow you to celebrate what’s important in your life. Reminding yourself of a positive affirmation or goal is empowering and tends to make us happier so it is definitely worth a shot.
Celebrate the important stuff with the art board.
The art board is a simple rectangular piece of powder coated metal. There are countless original arrangements you can create using photos, laminates, fabrics, or various other materials you can stick to it. Trying to showcase a few different ways to use the art board was one of the most enjoyable parts of this project so far. It will keep your inner-maker in creative bliss for hours.

<p>We are just a couple of dudes who absolutely love NFTs and love showing off more. We hail from tech and marketing backgrounds and are obsessed with the idea of merging the two together into an aesthetically pleasing and secure NFT display. One of the super nerds on our team also has a cybersecurity background so you know your stuff will be safe!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to create the first stand alone NFT display to provide a secure way to view your NFTs on large screens. You will no longer have to pull your phone out every time you want to show your friends your digital art collection. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The display will be run using a Raspberry Pi (or other form of processing unit), which will also house an NFT wallet app that fully integrates your See NFT Display with your existing NFT wallet. You will be easily able to control the display to scroll through different NFTs directly from the wallet integration app, or using an infrared remote.  We plan on integrating with all major NFT applications in the future, but will start with ERC-721 driven NFTs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The integration of NFT wallets directly into the SEE NFT Display provides enhanced security when compared to mirroring applications that just project your NFTs onto  existing devices. These mirroring applications present security vulnerabilities by sharing hash and private key information across potentially unsecure WiFi networks to displays that may lack the necessary security protocols to keep your NFTs safe. See NFT Displays will leverage existing security protocol of NFT wallets, making them safer and more secure. This allows you to still enjoy your NFT collection while knowing that it is safe.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The display will also display the serial number associated with each NFT, featuring a programmed custom QR code that can be scanned to prove ownership. This is how your friends will know you really are true the owner of your awesome NFT collection!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The displays will  be able to support still and live images, and we plan on adding speakers in later releases. We are planning to create the displays in the below 3 sizes. All displays will be very sleek with a bezel-less design with rounded edges. We plan on expanding to even larger displays after the initial production for this Campaign. </p>

As I watched the last light bulb come down from a failed store I put everything into, I stood in the empty space in awe of how easily things could be gone.  I then went home to an empty apartment I couldn’t afford to keep anymore and sat on the only piece of furniture left, one pillow, and thought God, what now?  I have nothing but debt in my name. Alone and distraught that day the only thing that made me get up and keep going was the sheer belief that one day I would see the satisfied look on customers faces and be happy  in the knowledge that my idea would have made someone’s life just a little bit easier as it did mine. So I got up and kept working. </p><p>Coming up with the idea was the easy part. Sourcing the right manufacturer, getting 3D designs, choosing the right color and dimensions was the hard part.  Working out the right ascetics was daunting.

As I watched the last light bulb come down from a failed store I put everything into, I stood in the empty space in awe of how easily things could be gone.  I then went home to an empty apartment I couldn’t afford to keep anymore and sat on the only piece of furniture left, one pillow, and thought God, what now?  I have nothing but debt in my name. Alone and distraught that day the only thing that made me get up and keep going was the sheer belief that one day I would see the satisfied look on customers faces and be happy  in the knowledge that my idea would have made someone’s life just a little bit easier as it did mine. So I got up and kept working. Coming up with the idea was the easy part. Sourcing the right manufacturer, getting 3D designs, choosing the right color and dimensions was the hard part.  Working out the right ascetics was daunting. I remember days where all I thought about all day was coming up with the right design.  I will never forget the day I figured it all out, I literally jumped up and down.  Here we are June 2017 a little over a year and a half after the inception of the idea and I am finally successfully selling my first batch of Wall Mounted Storage Boxes but I need to produce way more if I intend to sell globally.This product is close to my heart because it was made for the busy woman on a budget working with limited space. It was also made for the woman who is trying to keep her space neat and organized while staying stylish and saving time.What We Need & What You GetThere is so much more I would like to accomplish with this product but I need roughly $60,000.00 in order to produce 5000 units in different colors, sizes and designs to sell and market globally.

<h3>Story:  </h3>
<p>My name is Mikael Holmqvist. Im a 26-year-old guy from Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>I have started to really like cooking. Why?  </p>
<p>I was walking through the mall one day and saw this super luxurious knife behind a glass monitor. It was a Japanese chef's knife. 63 layers of steel. Handle made of Micarta. Wow, it looked so stunning!  </p>
<p>However, it was really expensive. (The price tag: 4990SEK, around €460)  </p>
<p><strong>That's where my idea was born. </strong>What if I could remove the middle man and start my own knife company?<strong> Design my own premium and luxurious kitchen knives with the same or even better quality, for a reasonable price? </strong></p>
<p>After months of designing, tweaking and testing; I finally came up with a sample that matched my idéa. I found a supplier in the Guangdong province that met all my needs in quality, durability and pricing. </p>
<p><strong>The result: </strong></p>
<p><strong>The 8"" NIKKALA chef knife.</strong> Much better priced than the €460 knife I saw in the mall. The best part:<strong> It's made of better materials.</strong></p>

<p><br/>We have used our 3D printers to create several working prototypes of the Maze Box. But now that the size and shape have been finalised, we will be using injection moulding and CNC engraving to produce a larger number of boxes economically, while ensuring we have flexibility with the patterns. <br/>We will be using a high strength plastic so that the box won't get damaged in case it is dropped (or thrown in frustration)!<br/> </p>

</div></div>","The Maze Box is a fun and addictive game that helps keep your personal items secure. It is created with an engraved pattern that is hidden when the box is closed. In order to open the box, the user must push, pull, and rotate the lid of the box in the correct pattern.

The Maze Box has been designed by FORM3D, a product design and prototyping firm. We have been working on the Maze Box for over a year and have created several prototypes to determine the perfect shape, sizes, patterns and materials for this box.  
There are two sizes- ideal for storing a variety of personal items.
Short box

Long box





We have used our 3D printers to create several working prototypes of the Maze Box. But now that the size and shape have been finalised, we will be using injection moulding and CNC engraving to produce a larger number of boxes economically, while ensuring we have flexibility with the patterns. We will be using a high strength plastic so that the box won't get damaged in case it is dropped (or thrown in frustration)! 

Injection MouldingCNC Engraving
The Maze Box comes in a standard single colour straight out of the injection moulding machine. Backers have the option of choosing beautiful marble-like finishes that are created through an innovative method of painting called hydro dipping.

The maze patterns have been designed to be difficult to solve, and also double up as an addictive game. The patterns we create take a very long time the first time anyone tries to open the box. However after learning the pattern, users should be able to open the box in under 15 seconds. Patterns will be changed every 100 boxes produced in order to keep them unique. If you order 2 boxes, we will ensure both have different patterns (unless you specify otherwise).
We will provide backers with a 2D cheat sheet of their pattern via email in order to make it easier to open their boxes the first time. However, we encourage backers to refrain from using it! Please message us and let us know if you'd rather not receive the cheat sheet.

<p><strong>1.1. Historical retrospective </strong></p>
<p>The applicants were motivated to initiate this project by the research of a group of American and British scientists<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a>. The results of their research, even in an optimistic scenario, are terrifying – within the following 25 years, tens of millions of people will suffer due to climate changes.</p>
<p>Simulation modeling of the ecosystem has shown that with the increase in temperature, such phenomena as storms and heavy rains will intensify in many regions of our planet. This, in turn, will significantly increase the risk of hydrosphere and man-made disasters, will enforce risks of war conflicts, including that with application of nuclear weapon. To protect the population from these disasters it is urgent to take anti-crisis measures.</p>
<p>Having analyzed numerous technical solutions of modern methods for protection from the global catastrophes, including injuring by nuclear attack, we consider that we have found a more effective solution that will allow people to reduce the risks of their impact and will allow to save themselves and their children!</p>
<p><strong>1.2. The problem</strong></p>
<p>Over the last century, climate change has resulted in global or long-term consequences - the death of people, animals and plants, or a serious disruption of a human life that requires asylum or migration.</p>
<p>While the growth of the Earth’s population necessitates the construction of more and more housing, the problem of balancing the need for housing with the dangers of global disasters is considered to be more actual than ever.</p>
<p>Each inhabitant of the Earth is subject to these climate changes and their subsequences in different form, regardless of a place of residence, sex, age, income level and intellectual development.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Evidences </strong></p>
<p>The results of climate changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>global temperature rise - the average temperature of the Earth's surface has risen by about 2.0 degrees by Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees by Celsius) since the late 19th century<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>;</li>
<li>warming of the oceans - the world ocean has absorbed most of this increased heat, and the upper 700 meters (about 2300 ft) of the ocean show a warming of 0.302 degrees by Fahrenheit since 1969<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>;</li>
<li>shrinking ice sheets - the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets decreased in mass (according to NASA, in the period from 2002 to 2005 Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice and this is without taking into account Greenland and other regions;</li>
<li>glacial retreat - Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>;</li>
<li>decreased snow cover - Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a>;</li>
<li>sea level rise - Global sea level rose by about 8 inches in the last century. However, the rate in the last two decades, is nearly twice as much as in the last century<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>;</li>
<li>declining of Arctic sea ice - both the level and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.4. Solution</strong></p>
<p>We decided not to wait for the governmental actions on protection of the Earth's ecosystem, but to seek ourselves effective technical solutions for ensuring human survival.</p>
<p> As a result of conducted engineering surveys, we found out one of the most effective solutions for protection population from the global catastrophes, including with results of radioactive contamination – floating bunker (surface-underwater house-bunker).  This solution will allow people to continue existence, not being afraid for their life and property!</p>
<p><strong>1.5. Strategic vision </strong></p>
<p>We would like to provide people with the opportunity to survive, in the event of global catastrophes, providing a safe, accessible and convenient place of residence and shelter.</p>
<p>We will strive to organize financing and create a pilot sample of a surface-underwater house-bunker in 2018. In 2019 we will strive to conduct a sample test (ability to withstand hurricanes and tsunamis) in the North part of Atlantic Ocean. In 2020 we will strive to expand production in the US and enter the market of floating shelters and floating bunkers. Then, by 2021, we will strive to become the leading developer in the segments of floating shelters and floating bunkers in water.</p>
<p><strong>1.6. Management &amp; team </strong></p>
<p>The launch team has all basic skills an knowledge necessary for implementation of this project.</p>

<p><strong>1.7. Project status </strong></p>
<p>  I started working on this project since January, 2017. All gained funds were directed for pre-design surveys. At the moment:</p>
<ol>
<li>The team of like-minded people is formed, which includes a group of scientific and technical specialists with experience and knowledge in basic product-forming technologies; </li>
<li>The product technology platform is defined;</li>
<li>3D visualization and architectural sketch were made, an optimal configuration of a test sample of the surface-underwater house-bunker was defined as well;</li>
<li>The optimal location place of experimental production site is defined;</li>

<li>Suppliers of technologies and resources (raw, materials, components and equipment) are identified for production of an experimental sample;</li>
<li>Potential production staff for experimental site is formed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1.8. Product technical specification</strong></p>
<p>            The product will be designed as an environmentally friendly surface-underwater residential module, which is a spherical capsule having external diameter 10 meters and 440 tons weight, made of innovative hard-reinforced high-strength concrete (UHPC) material capable to withstand very high impact and static loads. When sinking in a depth of 25 meters the module is able to prevent the penetration of radioactive emitting<a href=""#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[8]</a>.  </p>
<p>            The product manufacturing is foreseen in two configurations: “SEAUNIT-Standard” and “SEAUNIT-Suite”. In addition, a possibility to join five residential modules in one floating settlement is also foreseen.</p>
<p>The module provides two underwater floors with large extra-strong windows. The body outside is going to be covered with the decorative protective layer of any color and drawing. The module has an upper landing pad with diameter of 12 meters, capable to accept helicopters with weight of up to 30 tons.</p>
<p>            The module will be equipped with all necessary life support and comfort systems. Sleep, rest, cooking zones, bathrooms and a toilet are designed inside of it.</p>
<p>            The standard module is fixed with a full anchor system, what stipulates the ability to be located not only on the water surface, but also under the water surface on the depth of 25 m in the event of catastrophe. If necessary, the module is towed by standard motorized crafts for any distances.</p>

</div></div>","1.1. Historical retrospective 
The applicants were motivated to initiate this project by the research of a group of American and British scientists[1]. The results of their research, even in an optimistic scenario, are terrifying – within the following 25 years, tens of millions of people will suffer due to climate changes.
Simulation modeling of the ecosystem has shown that with the increase in temperature, such phenomena as storms and heavy rains will intensify in many regions of our planet. This, in turn, will significantly increase the risk of hydrosphere and man-made disasters, will enforce risks of war conflicts, including that with application of nuclear weapon. To protect the population from these disasters it is urgent to take anti-crisis measures.
Having analyzed numerous technical solutions of modern methods for protection from the global catastrophes, including injuring by nuclear attack, we consider that we have found a more effective solution that will allow people to reduce the risks of their impact and will allow to save themselves and their children!
1.2. The problem
Over the last century, climate change has resulted in global or long-term consequences - the death of people, animals and plants, or a serious disruption of a human life that requires asylum or migration.
While the growth of the Earth’s population necessitates the construction of more and more housing, the problem of balancing the need for housing with the dangers of global disasters is considered to be more actual than ever.
Each inhabitant of the Earth is subject to these climate changes and their subsequences in different form, regardless of a place of residence, sex, age, income level and intellectual development.
1.3. Evidences 
The results of climate changes are:

global temperature rise - the average temperature of the Earth's surface has risen by about 2.0 degrees by Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees by Celsius) since the late 19th century[2];
warming of the oceans - the world ocean has absorbed most of this increased heat, and the upper 700 meters (about 2300 ft) of the ocean show a warming of 0.302 degrees by Fahrenheit since 1969[3];
shrinking ice sheets - the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets decreased in mass (according to NASA, in the period from 2002 to 2005 Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice and this is without taking into account Greenland and other regions;
glacial retreat - Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa[4];
decreased snow cover - Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier[5];
sea level rise - Global sea level rose by about 8 inches in the last century. However, the rate in the last two decades, is nearly twice as much as in the last century[6];
declining of Arctic sea ice - both the level and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades[7].

1.4. Solution
We decided not to wait for the governmental actions on protection of the Earth's ecosystem, but to seek ourselves effective technical solutions for ensuring human survival.
 As a result of conducted engineering surveys, we found out one of the most effective solutions for protection population from the global catastrophes, including with results of radioactive contamination – floating bunker (surface-underwater house-bunker).  This solution will allow people to continue existence, not being afraid for their life and property!
1.5. Strategic vision 
We would like to provide people with the opportunity to survive, in the event of global catastrophes, providing a safe, accessible and convenient place of residence and shelter.
We will strive to organize financing and create a pilot sample of a surface-underwater house-bunker in 2018. In 2019 we will strive to conduct a sample test (ability to withstand hurricanes and tsunamis) in the North part of Atlantic Ocean. In 2020 we will strive to expand production in the US and enter the market of floating shelters and floating bunkers. Then, by 2021, we will strive to become the leading developer in the segments of floating shelters and floating bunkers in water.

1.7. Project status 
  I started working on this project since January, 2017. All gained funds were directed for pre-design surveys. At the moment:

The team of like-minded people is formed, which includes a group of scientific and technical specialists with experience and knowledge in basic product-forming technologies; 
The product technology platform is defined;
3D visualization and architectural sketch were made, an optimal configuration of a test sample of the surface-underwater house-bunker was defined as well;
The optimal location place of experimental production site is defined;
Preliminary technical solution and product specification have been developed; 
Suppliers of technologies and resources (raw, materials, components and equipment) are identified for production of an experimental sample;
Potential production staff for experimental site is formed.

1.8. Product technical specification
            The product will be designed as an environmentally friendly surface-underwater residential module, which is a spherical capsule having external diameter 10 meters and 440 tons weight, made of innovative hard-reinforced high-strength concrete (UHPC) material capable to withstand very high impact and static loads. When sinking in a depth of 25 meters the module is able to prevent the penetration of radioactive emitting[8].  
            The product manufacturing is foreseen in two configurations: “SEAUNIT-Standard” and “SEAUNIT-Suite”. In addition, a possibility to join five residential modules in one floating settlement is also foreseen.
The module provides two underwater floors with large extra-strong windows. The body outside is going to be covered with the decorative protective layer of any color and drawing. The module has an upper landing pad with diameter of 12 meters, capable to accept helicopters with weight of up to 30 tons.
            The module will be equipped with all necessary life support and comfort systems. Sleep, rest, cooking zones, bathrooms and a toilet are designed inside of it.
            The standard module is fixed with a full anchor system, what stipulates the ability to be located not only on the water surface, but also under the water surface on the depth of 25 m in the event of catastrophe. If necessary, the module is towed by standard motorized crafts for any distances.

</div></div>","Karma is a virtual assistant designed to help you become a better human being. She will remind you to weigh yourself and exercise, remember doctor's appointments, and otherwise help with all the chores and tasks that nobody likes to do.
Karma is the perfect helper for everybody.
How Karma Works


Goal setting: She will help you make smart goals that are tailored to your life. Connect your calendar and goal data to make goals that are achievable given your lifestyle. Working multiple jobs? Have kids and parents to take care of? Your health and wellness goals should keep these in mind.

The Internet of Things: Karma connects to your smartphone, internet of things devices, and data services such as Gmail and Facebook. To build a view of your health simply based on your step count and heart rate would be incomplete. Karma develops a fuller picture of who you are.

Always on, always connected: Karma is always connected, wherever you go. When you are at home, she will speak to you in person. When you are out, she will call and text you. Even in emergency situations like blackouts, Karma will keep track of your goals until she can be connected again.

Motivation: Karma is also a gamified platform, which provides additional motivation for completing your goals. When you do well, you will level up and Karma will treat you with kindness like her favourite child. When you do poorly, she will dock levels and be more strict with you. Be good for Karma. 


How Karma can Help
Karma can help you:

Keep track of your meditation practice
Change your sheets and clean your home
Get enough sleep and exercise
Walk and get enough steps per day
Get up every hour instead of being sedentary
Go to the grocery store
Do your laundry
Make and keep appointments for doctors and dentists
Tell you about your friends and family's milestones
Remember to call your actual mother
Maintain a healthy weight
Order products if you do not have the appropriate devices for tracking a goal
And more.

Believe in Karma.
Stretch Goals

The prototype of Karma has partial functionality. Karma is able to create goals and connect to Fitbits, Smart Scales, Facebook, and your Google Calendar, but there is still much that is needed before we can launch as a product. Your funds will be used towards completing product development and reducing manufacturing costs at scale.
Financial TrackingIf we beat $75,000, we will add connectivity to Mint and Intuit, so Karma can keep minute track of your financial goals and block you from any unwise purchases.
23andMeIf we beat $100,000, we will add support for 23andMe data, so Karma can proactively advise you on your ailments before you even know you have them.
Built-in cameraWe plan connectivity with IP cameras, but if we beat our $150,000 goal we will add 360 cameras to Karma so she can truly always be watching you.
BreathalyzerIf we beat $200,000, we will add a breathalyzer to Karma to help people control their drinking directly. Karma will be able to measure blood alcohol content and prevent you from drinking too much.

<p>Stud Wall Storage (SWS) is the best storage solution using framing studs of most residential construction in the U.S. Those with a basement, garage, or shed often have exposed 2 X 4 constructed walls with the studs having 16 inch centers and available unused space.</p>
<p>My stuff found that spot ideal as an area with easy access and possibilities. Space nothing else wanted but many things could use.  Rather than in boxes, out of sight and out of mind, SWS shelves are the easiest and most durable way for making unused space into prime storage.</p>
<p>Some uses are; Books, DVD's, CD's, cleaning supplies, painting supplies, tools, toys...</p>
<p>The stud wall space is 14.5 inches wide X 3.5 inches deep X height of the open wall.  The SWS 16 inch width allows front facing installation to studs PLUS parallel units across the wall.  The 3.625 depth insures the SWS unit reaches the wall board. </p>

So I thought to myself, why not really keep them dry with some sort of drying agent. I already used drying agents to keep my tools nice and dry so they would last longer.

What is DriBlade?</strong></u></h3><p>  The DriBlade Razor Pad Kit is a second generation shaving razor dry kit based upon our first successful model, the DriBlade Shaving Razor Dry Kit for Men. Our new model keeps any style or brand shaving razor dry and sanitary for both men and women.</p><h3><u>2. Why keep your razor dry?</u></h3><p><b> </b> After each shave, the moisture left behind on the metal blades begins to mix with the air and oxidize or micro-rust the blades. The results are irritating shaves, unsanitary blades that attract bacterial growth and limited razor life.</p><h3><u><strong>3. How does DriBlade work?</strong></u></h3><p><strong>  </strong>The DriBlade 2 Razor Pad contains a newly developed and 100% natural desiccant or dry board that wicks and locks away any damaging moisture left behind on your razor and inhibits the corrosion process.</p><h3><u><strong>4. How does the DriBoard Renew?</strong></u></h3><p><b> </b> Between one and two months after the DriBoard becomes expired or exhausted, simply remove from the Razor Pad and place within your microwave on a clean paper towel. Set power level to Low or level 3 for 1 minute. Let cool for 2 minutes and place back within the Razor Pad.</p><h3><u><strong>5. How do you know when the DriBoard is expired/full?</strong></u></h3><p><b> </b> The DriBlade Razor Pad contains a built-in color freshness indicator that notifies you precisely when to recharge or replace the exhausted DriBoard. The indicator will fade from Brown (fresh) to a light Yellow (expired).</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h2><p>  Although we have been manufacturing plastic parts and ordering desiccants since 2012, there is always the chance of something going wrong. We've been through incorrect parts delivered to long customs delays. But for each process that something unexpected has risen, we were quick to learn from. We are confident that we can handle most manufacturing and supplier issues as we have hired a very competent quality control manager for the entire manufacturing, assembly, packaging and shipping process. We are looking forward to working with our manufacturer and suppliers again and feel we have built a great relationship with everyone. We will keep our backers up to date on the entire process and report any issues or delays.</p><p><i><strong>Patrick Sassano<br/>Team Lead</strong></i></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Special Thanks!</h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498874210/hljsx1xhuotiuqaktprf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498852313/wom7r8sz6hvfk1jnaco6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xUOrvZV8ilHIXyENOw/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","Your razor - One month - Like new - GuaranteedYes, that is a bold claim, but we're confident that if you keep your razor dry with the DriBlade Razor Pad Kit, your favorite razor will stay fresh and sharp resulting in smoother shaves with less irritation, nicks and cuts.The DriBlade system is our second generation model redesigned to inhibit razor corrosion and prevent bacteria from forming on today's fine blades by using newly developed desiccant technology! The Issue with Air DryingAllowing cartridge razors to air dry reduces the razor's useful longevity. It's like leaving your favorite tool outside to rust. Today's popular multi-blade designs trap and hold moisture longer... resulting in corrosion and bacteria formation of the fine and delicate blades.                                                       
 The SolutionWe’ve solved these issues by designing a system that keeps razors dry, leading to smoother shaves and longer lasting, hygienic blades.

After each shave, just rinse your razor and press upon the absorbent pad before placing on the DriBlade Razor Pad.                                                          
   Second GenerationDriBlade is a second generation model based upon our original that we have been selling on Amazon for the past 3 years. We've received over 200 emails with comments and feedback on how to improve DriBlade. The second generation model is our answer. FeedBack on the Original Improvements over the Original Wharton SBDC Test SurveyDriBlade was invited by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Small Business Development Center to perform product testing with 20 individuals. Survey respondents were asked to compare the comfort of their razor on a five-point scale after a two-week period between using DriBlade and another two weeks allowing their razor to air dry. Above is the average. The Blue Dye TestA comparison showing how much water is trapped within a typical cartridge razor immediately after rinsing, one hour of air drying and one hour using DriBlade.By quickly removing any damaging moisture from between the blades your razor will rust less, stay sharp and last longer! PerksHere's a breakdown of our perks you can choose from when you support our campaign (select your perk from the sidebar at the top of this page). Shipping within the US is FREE! Thanks! Team DriBladeThe Team behind DriBlade is comprised of a group with diverse backgrounds from different parts of the world that gave us a great perspective when creating the new DriBlade model. Our StoryI created DriBlade and this campaign for a simple reason. To improve your shaving experience (and mine). In 2010 I read an article on how to increase the life of shaving razors -(http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/yourmone...). The article confirmed that razors quickly micro-rust and the best way to protect them was to dry them. And that's what I started to do. I would blot my razor after each shave on a paper towel. I did start to notice that my razor would last longer with less irritation. So I thought to myself, why not really keep them dry with some sort of drying agent. I already used drying agents to keep my tools nice and dry so they would last longer. And I always noticed those little packets in shoe boxes and medicine bottles. So why not apply the same principle to razors. And that's when my obsession began on how best to keep razors dry, sharp and clean.We started small introducing DriBlade I at many street fairs in NY, NJ, PA and DE where we were able to speak to people one on one to receive their honest feedback and comments. We sold thousands of units on Amazon and received an average rating of over 4 stars.The feedback we received during the past 3 years based upon DriBlade I allowed us to modify, refine and test many prototypes until we found an ideal way to care for your favorite razor. DriBlade 2 is our answer.We are confident that your razor will perform better providing you smoother shaves and longer lasting blades. I found that it's not so much your razor, but how you maintain it. Instead of your razor becoming more irritating each day...Your razor will stay consistently sharp between cartridge changes...So continue using your favorite razor or subscribing to a shave club, but in between cartridge changes, maintain your razor with DriBlade and have a fresh razor every morning. Thanks for viewing or campaign and I'm confident that your shaving experience will be much smoother with DriBlade!Patrick SassanoTeam Lead Here's a sample of over 30 prototypes we tested to get it just right Timeline DriBlade FAQs 1. What is DriBlade?  The DriBlade Razor Pad Kit is a second generation shaving razor dry kit based upon our first successful model, the DriBlade Shaving Razor Dry Kit for Men. Our new model keeps any style or brand shaving razor dry and sanitary for both men and women.2. Why keep your razor dry?  After each shave, the moisture left behind on the metal blades begins to mix with the air and oxidize or micro-rust the blades. The results are irritating shaves, unsanitary blades that attract bacterial growth and limited razor life.3. How does DriBlade work?  The DriBlade 2 Razor Pad contains a newly developed and 100% natural desiccant or dry board that wicks and locks away any damaging moisture left behind on your razor and inhibits the corrosion process.4. How does the DriBoard Renew?  Between one and two months after the DriBoard becomes expired or exhausted, simply remove from the Razor Pad and place within your microwave on a clean paper towel. Set power level to Low or level 3 for 1 minute. Let cool for 2 minutes and place back within the Razor Pad.5. How do you know when the DriBoard is expired/full?  The DriBlade Razor Pad contains a built-in color freshness indicator that notifies you precisely when to recharge or replace the exhausted DriBoard. The indicator will fade from Brown (fresh) to a light Yellow (expired). Risks and Challenges  Although we have been manufacturing plastic parts and ordering desiccants since 2012, there is always the chance of something going wrong. We've been through incorrect parts delivered to long customs delays. But for each process that something unexpected has risen, we were quick to learn from. We are confident that we can handle most manufacturing and supplier issues as we have hired a very competent quality control manager for the entire manufacturing, assembly, packaging and shipping process. We are looking forward to working with our manufacturer and suppliers again and feel we have built a great relationship with everyone. We will keep our backers up to date on the entire process and report any issues or delays.Patrick SassanoTeam Lead Special Thanks!",60.0,2,"1 Campaign

A FEW MORE THINGS...

 
Privacy and Security
To protect your privacy and security, we’ve included a dedicated mute button at the top of every Lynky smart home hub. It shuts off the microphone array so that the Google Assistant won’t listen for ""OK Google"". Syncing between Lynky hubs in your home, and smartphone-based control of Lynky while at home stays securely within your network. Connections to the Lynky.me cloud service (for configuration backups and away-from-home control) are fully encrypted.

 
Multi-Room Sync
Every Lynky in your home connects automatically to each other. Any control or adjustment made on one Lynky automatically syncs across to your other Lynky hubs. And each Lynky hub can have its own ""Home Screen"" and screensaver / display settings.

 
Touch-Based Volume Control
Adjust the volume of Lynky via the touch-sensitive surface below the screen.

  Native IFTTT SupportLynky can trigger IFTTT actions to occur, and Lynky scenes and devices can activate based on IFTTT applet triggers. In addition, IFTTT actions can be part of Lynky scenes, schedules and automations. And nearly the entire setup process can be done right from within the Lynky interface*. 

*Services that you wish to use with IFTTT must be setup within your IFTTT account, and your account must be linked to your Lynky.me account.

You can place it in essentially any convenient location in your home near an outlet. Lynky Desktop Edition is powered by USB for even more flexibility.Lynky Wall Version replaces an existing single light switch and turns it into a beautiful smart home control panel. And Lynky lets you control what’s connected to that switch with a special double-tap gesture, so you won’t lose a light switch in the process. THE LYNKY STORYThe Lynky team came together several years ago with a simple mission: To make the modern smart home truly smart, but easy for anyone to use. Our members have backgrounds in software and hardware engineering, start-ups, business, finance and leadership. After two solid years of development, the Lynky smart home hub is ready for production. We designed it from the ground up, integrating the best features and concepts that we wanted in our own smart homes, and created a product that consumers will love to bring into their homes. Drawing from our combined expertise, we’re working to create a simpler and more affordable smart home experience for everyone with an eventual full smart device line-up.  HISTORY AND TIMELINE For two solid years, we’ve worked on Lynky, creating multiple prototypes and testing each one based on pilot testing groups and user feedback. Today, we’re excited to take Lynky to the next level with mass production.  Final Prototype  STRETCH GOALSUnlocking Soon!  #GetLynkyHelp us share Lynky with the world, smash throughour fundraising goal and revealexciting new perks and surprises!igg.me/at/lynky  A FEW FAQ Where can I use Lynky?Lynky will be initially certified for, and offered for sale only in the U.S. International expansion is planned for 2018. How easy is it to install Lynky?Lynky Desktop Version is a ready-to-use product, all you need is a place to put it, plug-in the micro-USB cable and connect to your home Wi-Fi using Lynky's touchscreen.Lynky Wall Version can replace your light switch on the wall, you can follow instructions included with Lynky to easily install it. There is built-in functionality within the Lynky Wall Version to control an existing light. (On/off only, also suitable for ceiling fans.) Does Lynky have a camera? Can it make video calls?With many people concerned about privacy in their homes these days, we opted to not include a camera in the Lynky hub. So, while you won't be able to make video calls, Lynky will have support for the Ring video doorbell, so you can see those at your front door. Additional Wi-Fi camera support will arrive in 2018. What’s the difference with using a single Lynky hub or multiple Lynky hubs?One Lynky includes all the functions and features for all your smart home needs, however, if you place more Lynky hubs in your home, you'll gain more benefits such as better wireless signal coverage for your smart devices and Google Assistant voice control in additional rooms. How can I use Google Assistant for voice control with Lynky?You'll be able to use Google Assistant to control your Lynky-connected smart home devices, and their scenes. Lynky devices are grouped into rooms, which enables additional flexibility. Just say ""OK Google, turn on the Kitchen Lights"" or a similar request. Your Lynky hub(s) will keep your smart home setup in-sync with Google Assistant automatically.Of course, Google Assistant works for much more than just controlling Lynky's devices and scenes. You can access all of the features of Google Assistant such as asking questions, getting news updates, playing games, weather updates and more. How can I use Lynky with IFTTT?Lynky has IFTTT support built-in, you just need to connect your IFTTT account via the touchscreen and then you can add and configure IFTTT applets for your Lynky scenes and automations. In addition, IFTTT can be triggered from Lynky as well. Will there be a warranty?Yes. There will be a full 12-month warranty on the Lynky smart home hub product. Why not Z-Wave?We've decided to initially utilize wireless communications systems that are standardized across the globe. Also, as Zigbee is built on the solid IEEE 802.15.4 standard, there are definitely some ""interesting"" connectivity possibilites for the future. RISKS AND CHALLENGES FCC CertificationWe are currently working toward obtaining FCC Equipment Authorization for both Lynky Desktop and Wall versions. We anticipate this being completed prior to mass-production and shipping, but any delay could cause the timeline to shift. We have no control over the length of time for the approval process. Device Testing and OptimizationLynky uses a plugin framework to connect many brands of smart devices through their local and also cloud API, we have developed a lot of plugins and tested them on real devices. We’re rapidly expanding this library of plugins, and will ultimately choose to ensure excellent functionality with popular smart home devices at launch. Lynky will continue to expand its compatibility for new and existing users in the future. Google Assistant SDK launchLynky uses Google Assistant SDK as its voice engine. Per Google’s announcement, the SDK will exit its current beta status by the end of this year and be ready for commercial device makers. If Google delays the SDK launch, Lynky will be affected and could be delayed. GET IN TOUCHPress Inquiries - press@lynky.comGeneral Inquiries - support@lynky.com",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Reduce, reuse, recycle no longer cuts it.  Our collective problem on the earth is too big.  We need to ‘re’-evaluate this outdated call to action.  Reconstruct, recalibrate, rethink, recalculate, repurpose, restructure, respect, repair, reclaim, revolution, reimagine.  It is exponential. </p>

<p><strong>Design for Today, Sustainable for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Our design team focuses on sustainable materials in all phases of design and manufacturing, from the product itself to the packaging in which it is shipped. The (re)x hanger is manufactured from 100% recycled plastic.  Raw materials are ocean plastics and multi-layer plastic (MLP) sourced from local recycling efforts in South Africa.  In addition to utilizing plastics from the ocean, we also use snack food bags, dog food bags, discarded flip flops, soles of shoes and other types of plastic waste.  MLP is not easily recyclable, but our manufacturing partner’s proprietary technology makes this possible.</p>

<h2>Beeley and Walsh</h2>
<p>Engineers and entrepreneurs Ian Beeley and Stephen Walsh first met in 2004 working on complex air pollution control, environmental systems. Breaking into the world of digital they have built up a portfolio of world first executions of interactive digital signage and control systems and now have a thirst to bring together there digital and engineering knowhow presenting the Silhouette shelf.</p>
<p>Ever honing and fine tuning their designs, Beeley &amp; Walsh draw on a vast degree of technical knowledge both personal and through a network of people that they have worked with over the years.</p>
<p>With a network of companies and connections at their disposal Beeley &amp; Walsh are offering the Silhouette Shelf as the first of a serious of product lines and aspire to launch several likeminded, simple yet understatedly functional campaigns in the following years.</p>
<p>Beeley, “I see every day mundane products as an opportunity to reinvent the wheel, or at least add a few spokes. I’m always looking to improve upon a tried and tested system to bring the standard to exciting or at least improve upon its functionality, integrating technology and new manufacturing processes to provide a twist on tradition” </p>
<p>Walsh, “The Silhouette Shelf is our first adventure into the exciting world of crowd funding and we are 100% behind this product. Bringing the product to the masses in this fashion not only gauges how relevant our product is but it will encourage us to fine tune the product by listening to our backers. When developing any new system, it is all to easy to get tunnel vision and we need to listen to our clients, what better way than this”.</p>

<h3>Manufacture</h3>
<p>Drawing upon our engineering experience and being active DIYers, Home renovators we have designed a product that is not only premium in feel and aesthetics but is also constructed from materials that are designed to give a simple installation and long lasting robust product. Having a background in design, manufacture and supply of fixings and hardware to both the automotive and aerospace industry, we have applied this same level of finished product standard to Silhouette Shelves.</p>
<p>The shelves are manufactured from modern lightweight materials using manufacturing techniques that give excellent component fit and finish.</p>
<p>Extruded aluminium sections form the core mounting structure of the shelf, this is fixed to the wall via quality screw fixings, all supplied within the kit. There are none of those cheap screws that you normally get in curtain rail or shelf fixing kits, you know the ones….they snap or the head rounds off as soon as you try and tighten them! Each shelf comes with suitable fixings for wood, masonry or plasterboard / drywall</p>
<p>The shelf panel is manufactured from opaque glass which conforms to British Standards (BS EN 121500:2000) and complies with US regulations. The glass edges are polished to eliminate any sharp edges. This installs neatly and securely into the aluminium extrusion.</p>
<p>The LED element &amp; power supply is hidden within an acrylic housing, which can be specified to IP65 rating to conform to kitchen and bathroom applications. The USB charging system is standard, proven, technology. The charging cable is supplied with the shelf kit and is specified correctly for the application to meet safety regulations. Again this component attaches to the aluminium extrusion securely, but can be removed at a future date should you wish to move the shelf to a new location.</p>
<p>Once funding commences for this project we will take the production to the prototyping stage, having already completed the design and proof of concept. Manufacturing will be completed by our production partner; a well established LED procurement and manufacturing supplier, based in the UK, that can manufacture with the required CE approvals. Supply agreement is already in place and the supplier has committed to support manufacturing through all stages of this crowd funding project with ongoing support once the product is in the market place.   </p>
<h3>Meet Mike Vince</h3>
<p>Mike has been drafted in to provide the entrepreneurs with promotional creative assistance displaying the product to the masses. Mike is a creative director of real sustenance with a vast portfolio of content and application creations to his name. Initial employed by Beeley &amp; Walsh for a digital campaign for JCDecaux, Mike has become an integral part of the Beeley &amp; Walsh business and the animations you see here are to his credit.</p>

Beeley and Walsh
Engineers and entrepreneurs Ian Beeley and Stephen Walsh first met in 2004 working on complex air pollution control, environmental systems. Breaking into the world of digital they have built up a portfolio of world first executions of interactive digital signage and control systems and now have a thirst to bring together there digital and engineering knowhow presenting the Silhouette shelf.
Ever honing and fine tuning their designs, Beeley & Walsh draw on a vast degree of technical knowledge both personal and through a network of people that they have worked with over the years.
With a network of companies and connections at their disposal Beeley & Walsh are offering the Silhouette Shelf as the first of a serious of product lines and aspire to launch several likeminded, simple yet understatedly functional campaigns in the following years.
Beeley, “I see every day mundane products as an opportunity to reinvent the wheel, or at least add a few spokes. I’m always looking to improve upon a tried and tested system to bring the standard to exciting or at least improve upon its functionality, integrating technology and new manufacturing processes to provide a twist on tradition” 
Walsh, “The Silhouette Shelf is our first adventure into the exciting world of crowd funding and we are 100% behind this product. Bringing the product to the masses in this fashion not only gauges how relevant our product is but it will encourage us to fine tune the product by listening to our backers. When developing any new system, it is all to easy to get tunnel vision and we need to listen to our clients, what better way than this”.

Manufacture
Drawing upon our engineering experience and being active DIYers, Home renovators we have designed a product that is not only premium in feel and aesthetics but is also constructed from materials that are designed to give a simple installation and long lasting robust product. Having a background in design, manufacture and supply of fixings and hardware to both the automotive and aerospace industry, we have applied this same level of finished product standard to Silhouette Shelves.
The shelves are manufactured from modern lightweight materials using manufacturing techniques that give excellent component fit and finish.
Extruded aluminium sections form the core mounting structure of the shelf, this is fixed to the wall via quality screw fixings, all supplied within the kit. There are none of those cheap screws that you normally get in curtain rail or shelf fixing kits, you know the ones….they snap or the head rounds off as soon as you try and tighten them! Each shelf comes with suitable fixings for wood, masonry or plasterboard / drywall
The shelf panel is manufactured from opaque glass which conforms to British Standards (BS EN 121500:2000) and complies with US regulations. The glass edges are polished to eliminate any sharp edges. This installs neatly and securely into the aluminium extrusion.
The LED element & power supply is hidden within an acrylic housing, which can be specified to IP65 rating to conform to kitchen and bathroom applications. The USB charging system is standard, proven, technology. The charging cable is supplied with the shelf kit and is specified correctly for the application to meet safety regulations. Again this component attaches to the aluminium extrusion securely, but can be removed at a future date should you wish to move the shelf to a new location.
Once funding commences for this project we will take the production to the prototyping stage, having already completed the design and proof of concept. Manufacturing will be completed by our production partner; a well established LED procurement and manufacturing supplier, based in the UK, that can manufacture with the required CE approvals. Supply agreement is already in place and the supplier has committed to support manufacturing through all stages of this crowd funding project with ongoing support once the product is in the market place.

<p>Life is busy and can be stressful. Why not simplify things where you can and start with organizing your kitchen drawers? With that in mind, we designed our patent pending Adjustable Cutlery Drawer Organizer and Adjustable Accessory Drawer Organizer. We were inspired by the idea that a quality product should be adjustable, innovative and beautifully designed as well as uniquely functional. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gallery.mailchimp.com/2e65828982a671a3d2380d6e7/images/95d8cfb8-ee57-4701-b465-163849cf415d.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our <strong><i>patent pending</i></strong> organizers offer several practical solutions to your messy drawer dilemma. Our organizers fit your stuff – not the other way around.

<p>Dividers can be added to create segments in the tray to establish just the right amount of space for your spatulas, wooden spoons and whisks.

</div></div>","Urban Collection’s Adjustable Cutlery and Accessory Drawer Organizers

Life is busy and can be stressful. Why not simplify things where you can and start with organizing your kitchen drawers? With that in mind, we designed our patent pending Adjustable Cutlery Drawer Organizer and Adjustable Accessory Drawer Organizer. We were inspired by the idea that a quality product should be adjustable, innovative and beautifully designed as well as uniquely functional. 

The Notorious Kitchen Junk Drawer
We all have one (or two or three). Chances are, you rifle through a jumble of useful yet extraordinarily disorganized utensils and gadgets at least once a day. It can be both time consuming and frustrating to deal with chaotic, untidy spaces. While other brands offer small organizers that only expand part way, are made of low quality, flimsy material, and/or simply fall apart in the drawer, the Urban Collection line was created to eliminate these issues.  

 
Think Customizable
Our patent pending organizers offer several practical solutions to your messy drawer dilemma. Our organizers fit your stuff – not the other way around. You can create spaces as big or as small as you need. Because our depth is approximately  18”, it fits your drawer better. The width can be adjusted and locked anywhere along the way to offer a variety of size options that fit your drawers best. 
Dividers can be added to create segments in the tray to establish just the right amount of space for your spatulas, wooden spoons and whisks. Our removable subdividers slide back and forth to allow for versatile adjustments, making room for your smaller items such as measuring spoons, cake decorating tips and chip clips.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>In today's pet subscription box world, there is an over-saturation of dog and cat products. There are NO boxes currently running for reptiles, despite there being over 4.8 million reptile owners in the United States alone. </p>
<p>That's where Jurassicrate comes in. Not only do we aim to provide high-quality nutrition to our scaly friends, but we aim to do it inexpensively. Each month, the crate will include 5 - 8 items that are backed with great reviews and used often in the reptile community. We will source these items at the best prices so owners can get more than their money's worth in each crate.</p>
<p>In addition to diets, the crate will include fake plants, hides, food bowls and more. We are planning on inserting a booklet in each crate with reptile information. Think of a Zoobook. But miniature. And just as adorable.</p>
<p>With our funding, we hope to get our first orders out and get us started. We are happy to provide receipts for transparency. The money also will go to other start-up costs including formally becoming a business, insurance, website upkeep, etc.</p>
<p>We hope you're interested in our idea and help fund us. We will be eternally grateful and plan on doing special things for our founders.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to get funding to get our initial bulk orders out. Once we get that, we should be set for future boxes. Furthermore, we want to become an LLC, insurance and get any sales permits we need to actually be up and running.</p>
<p>Prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bulk Order: $1362</li>
<li>LLC Creation, Insurance + Associated Paperwork: $350</li>
<li>If we do not get fully funded, the funds will go to creating the LLC so that we can get business loans for Jurassicrate. If we do not get enough to fully fund the LLC creation, it'll still be used toward it. We will be able to provide proof of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>...So what is in it for you? For our backers, we are offering tons of goodies including special crates specifically curated for you and your reptiles. We will be personally contacting each of our backers to get an idea of what products they want in their crates. We are offering unique crates for a year after backing. Furthermore, you will be on our website (if you'd like) as a helping founder of Jurassicrate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Development of Jurassicrate has been running smooth and on schedule. Only a completely unpredictable event such as the shortage of some key materials could delay our production, and then only temporarily. This is has been a very well thought-out project, and we are confident of, and committed to, delivering a quality product on time.</p>
<p>Of course, you're welcome to your investment back if this does not come to fruition, but that is not in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The base crafted from pure organic wood is fitted with three bright LEDs. The lights are powered by 9 volt batteries that are housed inside the wooden base. A transparent block of resin decorated with oaken wood and artificial natural ornaments helps scatter the light evenly in a soft and luminous fashion.

<p> </p>
<h3>Inspired From Nature</h3>
<p>Our design draws its main inspiration from nature. Most of us live in urban settlements saturated by concrete structures. The elements we use in our design give us that little touch of nature lacking in our lives. We use oak and walnut as wood, and artificial replicas of authentic leaves and flowers because real ones don’t survive properly in the resin and lose their beauty during curing. The woods, leaves and flowers eye-catchingly blend in the design and give a satisfying glow with the LEDs.</p>

<h3>Aesthetic</h3>
<p>From adorning conventional to modern house hold, in bedrooms, living rooms, kitchen, bookshelves, side tables, counters or any other possible place you could think of in your personal or official premesis, the natural design of our lamps make it possible for them to look aesthetic in any space.</p>

The thing is, there has not been a lot of pressure on the industry to fix this problem, due in large part to an overwhelming lack of public awareness. The problem, however, is still definitely there.With our silicone shower / face / kitchen brush, we are turning the entire concept of this product on its head. Our brush is made out of FDA-approved, food-grade silicone, making it soft and easy to dry, but most importantly, this brush is safe, preventing the sort of bacteria build-up that you see in cloth and other porous materials. If you care about your health, you want one of these brushes for your bathroom, your kitchen, your laundry room – basically anywhere you need to scrub anything. It is time to kick germs and bacteria to the curb, and the only way to do that is to get rid of the sponges and towels that we have become so dependent on. Our silicone brush is the answer.  The research doesn’t lie. One group of researchers based out of Furtwangen University in Germany studied 14 different used kitchen sponge samples, and do you know what they found? 362 different types of bacteria stuck within the foam. Sponges are a hotbed for bacterial activity. To learn more, check out http://www.sciencealert.com/you-don-t-want-to-k.... What We Need & What You GetWe are turning to you, Indiegogo, for help raising $27,000.  These funds will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing our silicone brush on a large scale. As a thank-you, we are offering everyone who contributes to this campaign the opportunity to reserve their own silicone brush before anyone else gets one (and at a huge discount too!). We have already created a prototype tooling, this brush could fit both right hand and left hand.This brush works!Your health matters.

<h3>Why Teaflo Works</h3>
<p>Steeping time is one of the most important cosiderations when preparing a good cup tea. The Teaflo allows the user to control the steep time down to increments of 10 seconds. This combined with the convenience of Teaflo being a portable application allows tea enthusiasts to steep a perfect cup of tea at work, home, or even on a picnic.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How is it powered?</h3>
<p>The Teaflo is powered by a rechargeable battery. A standard USB cable plugs into the side of the Cap. It takes about 20 minutes to fully charge. A fully charged battery should last about 2 1/2 months if used 2-3 times daily.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Teaflo is not a complicated product to use or produce. For this reason we are going to begin setting up production during our campaign rather then waiting until the end like most other campaigns. We will be using funds from Indiegogo supporters to finish our production and also to develop other tea related products and even create a line of different teas from around the world for our customers to enjoy.</p>
<p>We are awarding all of our Early Bird sign ups with their choice of ether the Teaflo Stand or 2 Double-Walled Glass Tea Cups. Both options have a value of USD $18.00. This means our first 500 customers will essentially receive the product at USD $30.00.</p>
<p>Because we are starting production now, we will be delivering the product to our supporters in just a few months. We will be able to do this because we are going to get a ""jump start"" on production at the same time we start our campaign on Indiegogo.</p>

However, we are still evaluating other ideas so please give us your feedback!<br/>Please remember to add the Shipping Perk: shipping to Italy is free; add 6$ for EU,USA and rest of the world. If you prefer a trackable shipping please remember to select the 15$ perk.<br/><hr/>

<h3>Status of the project &amp; next steps</h3>
<p>We've spent the last year designing the product, developing the app, testing the prototypes and taking contacts with possible manufacturers. Now, when we are finally ready to start  Bangle production, we need your help: only with a minimum quantity of ordered Bangles we can obtain mass-production prices for materials, workshop operations and assembly. In details, next steps after the campaign will be:</p>

<p>There are already wearable NFC products on the market, NFC technology is available since 2006 and competing with smartwatches and last hi-tech devices from huge manufacturers is no way within our reach.</p>
<p>So, what are we doing??</p>
<p>Well, Yporia Bangle is not an hi-tech device. <b>Our Bangle is a jewel, in step with the times</b>; other NFC gadgets are, let me say, ONLY GADGETS. Yporia Bangle was designed to be the main part of a bigger <b> dedicated </b> system, in conjuction with our Android App and a cloud space.<br/></p>
<p><i>Our Bangle is beautiful, long lasting, with a cloud system that offer exclusive services, completely different from what other NFC-based products do</i></p>
<p><i>It is the only unlocking device sold ""ready to use"", with no need to hack your phone, without hundreds of settings and drawbacks.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the only NFC device fully customizable, designed to transmit a personal message, made to show who you are.</i></p>
<p><i>It is the only device made from steel and premium materials, instead of cheap silicone rubber.</i></p>
<p><i>It can be read from any NFC device,  anytime, anywhere, without needing to install apps and other software.</i></p>
<p><i>It is battery-less, cable-less, waterproof, shock resistant.</i></p>

<p>The same way best ideas come to life. Two
friends at the pub, some wine and a smartphone in their hands. <br/></p>
<p>Following our idea and wearing Yporia Bangle since it was a sharp rough piece
of metal, worked once in a day and lose glue on our wrists, we developed the whole project keeping well in mind what is our concept of a good porduct and a successful team.</p>
<p><i>First of all, Yporia Bangle is a very
beautiful object. The smooth edges of the marine steel, its shine and
flexibility. The soft coating that hides electronic parts.</i></p>

Moreover, we are working on <b>many other projects</b>, really attractive for both  the Indiegogo audience and the traditional marketplace, which will all be ""sons"" of Yporia Bangle.

Yporia smart bangle is a universal gadget, compatible with every device and app that supports NFC.

With the companion Yporia App you can use all of its functions in a user friendly, fast and simple interface.

Bangle-dependent phone themes and settings

Black Yporia Bangle for job meetings, red for cocktails, fluo for parties. The phone theme will automatically change following the Bangle you wear, as connectivity and safety settings will do. Everything is completely customizable and normal sticky NFC tags are also supported, increasing overall flexibility. It's an Yporia product, never forget it.

As an added feature, every NFC reader in the world will be able to retrieve stored memories, even without our App.Make a special gift, link a bracelet to a picture and then link it again around the wrist of someone special to you.





 

MY BANGLE



Choose the material and color you prefer, add a personalized engraving on the inner steel surface,  choose the number of NFC tags.

 You won’t find another bangle like this. 
 You won’t find another Bangle like yours. 
The waterproof plastic coating is very resistant: show off your Yporia Bangle on the beach, in the pool or in the Sahara.
The body, machined in hypoallergenic marine grade stainless steel, won’t show a scratch even after rough usage and won’t bother you under hot conditions.
    Is the office your habitat? Are you an evening wear king? Let your leather or tissue Yporia Bangle tell everyone your class and attention to details.
 Light and elegant, it’s the detail that makes a difference
Yporia Bangle, whoever you are, it's made for you



Current available colors and materials:






HOW IT'S MADE

Premium quality marine steel. Hypoallergenic, it is extremely flexible and retains its luster over time.

 
NFC tags need to be isolated from the metal. The special insulating layer ensures correct functionality, with a thickness of just 0.5 mm (1.5 alpha version). 

 
Yporia bangle can fit up to three NFC chips. They are universally supported and can be read (and written) by any device equipped with this technology.


 


The outer layer is fixed by special adhesives that bind it to the layer behind. Customization possibilities can satisfy anyone: glossy and bright plastic, rubber with embossed texture, leather, and even fabrics like Denim.

Yporia Bangle is outstandingly comfortable and lightweight with its thickness of  only 1.4mm (2.5 alpha version) and 14mm width.
Due to minimum order quantity (MOQ) of some components of the Yporia Bangle, 1.4mm Bangle total thickness is assured only if the campaign rises a minimum of 150 000 $. Otherwise, a maximum thickness of 2.5mm is guaranteed and 1.4mm is at full Yporia discretion.

Packaging and shipping solutions
We are still thinking about all the possible packaging solutions but we are mainly oriented towards two possibilities. In the first case, your personal Yporia Bangle will be shipped inside a premium leather bag, without added costs. The second solution involves a small cardboard box, fully decorated and conceived as a fashion gift box, available for 9$ (plus the perk cost). However, we are still evaluating other ideas so please give us your feedback!Please remember to add the Shipping Perk: shipping to Italy is free; add 6$ for EU,USA and rest of the world. If you prefer a trackable shipping please remember to select the 15$ perk.

Our old prototypes:



How to choose my personal Bangle?
Choose the perk you prefer and place the order. Following ""how to claim a perk"" topic in the Indiegogo Help Center, you'll have to contact us providing your color/material/personalization choice. We are also developing a section on our web site dedicated to product personalization: Indiegogo users will be able to log in and select colors, materials and personalizations. Stay tuned!


Status of the project & next steps
We've spent the last year designing the product, developing the app, testing the prototypes and taking contacts with possible manufacturers. Now, when we are finally ready to start  Bangle production, we need your help: only with a minimum quantity of ordered Bangles we can obtain mass-production prices for materials, workshop operations and assembly. In details, next steps after the campaign will be:



Order all the materials such as stainless steel, leather and insulating layer


Order the molds for plastic injection


Order NFC tags


Machine steel and produce plastic covers


Assemble, and eventually personalize, the product 


Perform quality tests


Produce packaging


Ship to your home


We are optimistic about shipping out Yporia Bangle the first weeks of June; however, due to possible production delays, we take no responsability for breaking this deadline.

If you think that Yporia Bangle is not as innovative as we claim, we... agree!
There are already wearable NFC products on the market, NFC technology is available since 2006 and competing with smartwatches and last hi-tech devices from huge manufacturers is no way within our reach.
So, what are we doing??
Well, Yporia Bangle is not an hi-tech device. Our Bangle is a jewel, in step with the times; other NFC gadgets are, let me say, ONLY GADGETS. Yporia Bangle was designed to be the main part of a bigger  dedicated  system, in conjuction with our Android App and a cloud space.
Our Bangle is beautiful, long lasting, with a cloud system that offer exclusive services, completely different from what other NFC-based products do
It is the only unlocking device sold ""ready to use"", with no need to hack your phone, without hundreds of settings and drawbacks.
It is the only NFC device fully customizable, designed to transmit a personal message, made to show who you are.
It is the only device made from steel and premium materials, instead of cheap silicone rubber.
It can be read from any NFC device,  anytime, anywhere, without needing to install apps and other software.
It is battery-less, cable-less, waterproof, shock resistant.
It is slim, lightweight, comfortable.
It is
SIMPLY. BEAUTIFUL.

WHO WE ARE

Students at the Polytechnic of Turin and
high school classmates, we are three 23 years old with much initiative. Always been technology addicted and “nice
things” lovers, we see Yporia Bangle as our launch pad.
Following all its development, son of
sleepless nights and head strikes against our desks, from scratch to the
innovative and beautiful yet so simple product it is now, is our greatest
satisfaction.

People always ask us why we have such ridiculous profile pictures:""Perchè si.""
HOW WAS THIS PROJECT BORN?
The same way best ideas come to life. Two
friends at the pub, some wine and a smartphone in their hands. 
Following our idea and wearing Yporia Bangle since it was a sharp rough piece
of metal, worked once in a day and lose glue on our wrists, we developed the whole project keeping well in mind what is our concept of a good porduct and a successful team.
First of all, Yporia Bangle is a very
beautiful object. The smooth edges of the marine steel, its shine and
flexibility. The soft coating that hides electronic parts.
Yporia is Italian manufacture, valuable
materials and design. Yporia stands for innovation, a glance to the future,
head in the clouds and feet down-to-earth.
WHAT'S NEXT?
We have big plans for the future. First of all, we'll open our business to traditional off-line marketplaces, taking contacts with possible local dealers and partners in the tourist industry (hotels, clubs). Following this purpose, we are currently developing an NFC door lock. Moreover, we are working on many other projects, really attractive for both  the Indiegogo audience and the traditional marketplace, which will all be ""sons"" of Yporia Bangle. In other words, supporting this campaign means supporting the birth of a new and -we hope- long lasting innovative company.MERCHANDISE

We have compiled a collection of Marscapes to celebrate the 1971 launch and subsequent mission of Mariner 9. In nearly a year of orbiting, Mariner 9 was able to capture and send 7,329 images (and roughly 54 billion bits of data) back to Earth.WhiteClouds' Marscapes are incredibly realistic reproductions of the Martian terrain based on pictures and topographical data gathered from multiple scientific resources.You will be able to choose different sizes, design styles, framing options, color borders, and quantities. These 3D decor pieces are NOT simply flat 2D prints of images.  Marscapes are raised surface models of the Martian landscape.   Section of Athabasca Marscape showing how changing daylight and shadows create a unique fourth-dimensional appearance (“Time”). A Marscape style, frame colors, and size to match any room

</div>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What is the science behind Luzi? </p>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>a. Since we have integrated a custom designed LED producing millions of color combinations, along with a sophisticated sound system capable of very low frequencies, Luzi is able to provide a wide range of options for healthier sleep, never before offered in a consumer device. Here are some of the studies we based our features on:</div>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/understanding_sleep.htm#Tips"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NIH Resources</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2717723/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NIH Study</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/how-pink-noise-makes-better-sleep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sound's Effect on Sleep</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom/hear.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sleep Foundation- Hear</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div>
</li>
<li><div>Wow, Luzi sounds incredible!  How do I know you can actually build it?""                 <span style=""background-color: initial;"">a. We're an experienced team of engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs with excellent track records of building and delivering innovative products. </span>
</div></li>
<li>
<p>What exactly is the patented Luzi Sleep system and how does it help me get to sleep faster? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. The Luzi Sleep system uses a combination of binaural beats, HRTF (head-related transfer function), IRF (induced resonant frequencies) and harmonic theory, applied in such a way as to produce sounds that encourage the human brain to shift into the metabolic maintenance modes associated with healthy sleep. The Luzi lamp audio system was custom designed to be able to reproduce these low frequencies that will help you get to sleep faster than you ever thought possible.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Luzi know when I get to sleep and what sleep state I am in?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. We have partnered with Fitbit and Luna to monitor your sleep state and pass that information to Luzi so we can learn what helps the most with your sleep. In the near future we plan to offer an optional sleep band that will be much more precise than other alternatives on the market.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have a beta test program for Luzi so I can get my hands on one earlier?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Yes, drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:hello@luzilamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@luzilamp.com</a> and let us know if you are interested! We will have limited numbers of beta units, so please understand we cannot fulfill all requests. And we will ask that those participating in our beta program provide regular feedback at least weekly on their experience and suggestions.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Luzi available in stores?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi will be sold only through our Indiegogo campaign link during the first 60-90 days, then available through our website after the Indiegogo campaign is closed. We do expect to offer Luzi via premium online retailers in 2016 and closely followed in select traditional retail stores.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What countries is Luzi currently available in?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi will initially be available in US, and followed shortly thereafter in Europe. We plan to offer additional major countries within 2016, please drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:hello@luzilamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@luzilamp.com</a> if you are from a country outside the US and we will add you to our notification list once available.</div>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<p>What color is Luzi available in initially and when do you plan more options?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi is available in white and black initially. We do plan additional colors soon after our initial launch based on votes by our backers.  Prior to shipping, you will be able to specify which color you prefer.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the voice control work on Luzi? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. We use advanced speech recognition software that responds to various commands to control all the typical things you might want Luzi to do for you. Some of the common commands include:
<ul>
<li>“Light On” (or off)</li>
<li>“Set Alarm”</li>
<li>“Start Sleep Cycle”</li>
<li>“Set the Mood” (for your favorite mood music)</li>
<li>“Play XXXXX” (play a track from your music library)</li>
<li>“Light Dim” (dims 25% at a time for each command)</li>
<li>“Light Color XXXXX” (change light to a specific LED color)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the stereo mode work if I own two Luzi Lamps?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. If you install two Luzi Lamps in the same room (i.e. one on each night stand), the pair will operate in stereo audio mode, providing a much richer listening experience.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If my power goes out, what happens to my clock on Luzi?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi has a battery backup to retain your settings including the clock. So no need to worry whether you will have an alarm if you lose commercial power.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Luzi operate autonomously or does it require my smartphone or tablet?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi does not require the use of a smart phone or tablet as it is designed to operate autonomously.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>What sensors are in Luzi and what are they used for? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Temperature sensor is used for measuring the ambient temperature of that room. Microphone is used to talk to Luzi and also auto-detect snoring (if activated). Ambient light sensor is used to auto-dim the display</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does Luzi offer Apple Health and Google Fit interface? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. Luzi will have an interface to both Apple Health and Google Fit to consolidate your health data and provide more meaningful personalized recommendations.</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the Luzi wireless charging base, which technologies are supported and which specific devices? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. The wireless charging base will support both Qi and PMA standards. This means it will be compatible with most smart phones available today that support wireless charging including the Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Even iPhones using a 3rd party case will work if they adhere to Qi or PMA standards. </div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does the Apple Watch stand work? </p>
<p></p>
<div>a. The optional Apple Watch stand attaches to the Luzi wireless charging base. It uses the standard wireless charging cable that comes with the Apple Watch, simply route the cable in the hidden channel and plug the USB into the back of Luzi!</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will Luzi support charging of other devices besides Apple Watch? </p>

<li>
<p>When will the wireless charging base and Apple Watch stand be available for sale?</p>
<p></p>
<div>a. We plan to offer these for sale prior to shipment of Luzi, subject to hitting our stretch goals for this campaign!</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I personalize the voice on Luzi? </p>

Since we have integrated a custom designed LED producing millions of color combinations, along with a sophisticated sound system capable of very low frequencies, Luzi is able to provide a wide range of options for healthier sleep, never before offered in a consumer device. Here are some of the studies we based our features on:

NIH Resources
NIH Study
Sound's Effect on Sleep
Sleep Foundation- Hear




Wow, Luzi sounds incredible!  How do I know you can actually build it?""                 a. We're an experienced team of engineers, designers, and entrepreneurs with excellent track records of building and delivering innovative products. 


What exactly is the patented Luzi Sleep system and how does it help me get to sleep faster? 

a. The Luzi Sleep system uses a combination of binaural beats, HRTF (head-related transfer function), IRF (induced resonant frequencies) and harmonic theory, applied in such a way as to produce sounds that encourage the human brain to shift into the metabolic maintenance modes associated with healthy sleep. The Luzi lamp audio system was custom designed to be able to reproduce these low frequencies that will help you get to sleep faster than you ever thought possible.



Does Luzi know when I get to sleep and what sleep state I am in?

a. We have partnered with Fitbit and Luna to monitor your sleep state and pass that information to Luzi so we can learn what helps the most with your sleep. In the near future we plan to offer an optional sleep band that will be much more precise than other alternatives on the market.



Do you have a beta test program for Luzi so I can get my hands on one earlier?

a. Yes, drop us a line at hello@luzilamp.com and let us know if you are interested! We will have limited numbers of beta units, so please understand we cannot fulfill all requests. And we will ask that those participating in our beta program provide regular feedback at least weekly on their experience and suggestions.



Is Luzi available in stores?

a. Luzi will be sold only through our Indiegogo campaign link during the first 60-90 days, then available through our website after the Indiegogo campaign is closed. We do expect to offer Luzi via premium online retailers in 2016 and closely followed in select traditional retail stores.



What countries is Luzi currently available in?

a. Luzi will initially be available in US, and followed shortly thereafter in Europe. We plan to offer additional major countries within 2016, please drop us a line at hello@luzilamp.com if you are from a country outside the US and we will add you to our notification list once available.



What color is Luzi available in initially and when do you plan more options?

a. Luzi is available in white and black initially. We do plan additional colors soon after our initial launch based on votes by our backers.  Prior to shipping, you will be able to specify which color you prefer.



How does the voice control work on Luzi? 

a. We use advanced speech recognition software that responds to various commands to control all the typical things you might want Luzi to do for you. Some of the common commands include:

“Light On” (or off)
“Set Alarm”
“Start Sleep Cycle”
“Set the Mood” (for your favorite mood music)
“Play XXXXX” (play a track from your music library)
“Light Dim” (dims 25% at a time for each command)
“Light Color XXXXX” (change light to a specific LED color)





How does the stereo mode work if I own two Luzi Lamps?

a. If you install two Luzi Lamps in the same room (i.e. one on each night stand), the pair will operate in stereo audio mode, providing a much richer listening experience.



If my power goes out, what happens to my clock on Luzi?

a. Luzi has a battery backup to retain your settings including the clock. So no need to worry whether you will have an alarm if you lose commercial power.



Does Luzi operate autonomously or does it require my smartphone or tablet?

a. Luzi does not require the use of a smart phone or tablet as it is designed to operate autonomously.



What is the Luzi app for? 

a. The Luzi app is used mainly for initial setup and configuration of the lamp (more advanced settings). It is not required for basic functionality of the lamp.



What smart phones and tablets is the Luzi App compatible with? 

a. Apple iPhone 5S or newer and iPad Mini, iPad Air or iPad 4 or higher, all running iOS 8.3 or higher. We also support most Android phones or tablets running Android v4.4 or higher.



What sensors are in Luzi and what are they used for? 

a. Temperature sensor is used for measuring the ambient temperature of that room. Microphone is used to talk to Luzi and also auto-detect snoring (if activated). Ambient light sensor is used to auto-dim the display



Does Luzi offer Apple Health and Google Fit interface? 

a. Luzi will have an interface to both Apple Health and Google Fit to consolidate your health data and provide more meaningful personalized recommendations.



For the Luzi wireless charging base, which technologies are supported and which specific devices? 

a. The wireless charging base will support both Qi and PMA standards. This means it will be compatible with most smart phones available today that support wireless charging including the Nexus 7 and Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. Even iPhones using a 3rd party case will work if they adhere to Qi or PMA standards. 



How does the Apple Watch stand work? 

a. The optional Apple Watch stand attaches to the Luzi wireless charging base. It uses the standard wireless charging cable that comes with the Apple Watch, simply route the cable in the hidden channel and plug the USB into the back of Luzi!



Will Luzi support charging of other devices besides Apple Watch? 

a. Yes, we will offer other popular smart watch options in the near future! Please drop us a line at hello@luzilamp.com as to what devices you would like to see us support.



When will the wireless charging base and Apple Watch stand be available for sale?

a. We plan to offer these for sale prior to shipment of Luzi, subject to hitting our stretch goals for this campaign!



Can I personalize the voice on Luzi? 

a. Yes, Luzi will come with several choices initially and more will be added in the future.



What are the dimensions of Luzi? 

a. The Luzi Lamp is approximately 5” square and 13” tall.



Is the LED light included? How long does it last? 

a. Yes, the color LED is included with the Luzi lamp and will offer many years of life (25,000 to 50,000 hrs of use).



What is the warranty on Luzi?

a. 1 year



What is the cost of shipping?

a. Luzi will be shipped at no additional charge within the US. Shipments to Western Europe are $69 including insurance.  Shipping costs for other countries will be announced in the future once available.

Once MAX is in control of a device you can use our advanced Voice technology and talk to MAX, or use the full featured smart phone app. MAX can perform many tasks at the same time and the more you use it, the more MAX “learns” what you want it to do. Let technology make your life easier for a changeWe have all grown up with movies that offer us a glimpse into the future. In Back to the Future we saw Food Re-Hydrators and Hoverboards. We watched as Marty talked to his TV and it displayed multiple things on command. In Marvel’s Ironman, Tony Stark dazzled us with holographic displays and of course “Jarvis”, his own personal Artificial Intelligence system capable of just about anything he asked.But here we are in 2017 and where are the flying cars and robots we have been waiting so long to see?  It seems like we are coming up short in the FUTURE department.Until nowIntroducing MAX, the world’s only all in one Smart Home Media Control Center with Customizable Voice Command and expansion components that allow you to turn your entire house into your own personal “Jarvis-like” Artificial Intelligence System.  Control your entire home from your TV or Smart Phone (using the MAX app) with voice commands or remote control…and that’s just the beginning. MAX Active App TechnologyOur “Active App” technology (Patent Pending) allows multiple devices and apps to display simultaneously on your TV to eliminate the not-so-smart task of switching your TV Input just to use a “smart app” for one minute. Imagine watching your favorite show, or playing a game and you need to see a quick video on YouTube that is related to what you’re doing…simply ask MAX to open YouTube and search for whatever you like. The app opens over top of your current media source, and you can even split the screen to watch side by side. The future is finally here! Open Source and Device CompatibilityMAX is designed to be friendly with almost any device that uses HDMI, Bluetooth, Wifi, or Z-Wave. The software is open source so that many apps can be installed and used to create your own custom experience.  Connect Cable and Satellite receivers, Xbox, Playstation, home audio, laptops, tablets, phones, Smart Home Automation, security systems, and much more! The OSD (On Screen Display)Easily open the MAX OSD with Voice Command or Remote and toggle thru custom categories with favorite apps and features for a wide variety of readily available functions. Here you can instantly switch between HDMI devices and Apps without ever switching your TV input. Apps and more!MAX comes preloaded with many of your favorite apps, and you can easily install many other apps that can be used for Active App display, and many other smart home functions. Active App OSDMany apps can be displayed “over” or along with your current source to avoid clunky switching. Split Screen CapabilityGamers and Sports enthusiasts will love this feature. It’s like Picture and Picture on steroids. You can choose any HDMI device, Wireless Device, or Software App and display them together on your TV. Play a video game while watching a tutorial, or watch Second Screen Experiences Live along with your favorite TV shows. Amazing! Monitor your security cameras anytime See who is at the door with instant notification!Don’t you hate when you settle in to watch a good movie and suddenly the doorbell rings? With a doorbell camera (sold separately) MAX will instantly show you who is at the door…now you can ignore pesky sales knockers trying to interrupt your fun! Side screen AppsCertain Apps can be designated to occupy the side of the TV so that you can look up info about favorite actors, some Wikipedia facts or even a live Twitter feed during a show! For all the Cord Cutters out there…MAX has an Antenna input and a full featured TV Channel Guide for all of your OTA (Over the Air) channels. Simply plug in your HD Antenna (sold separately) and let MAX detect everything in your area. Bye-Bye cable bill! Smart Home just got a heck of a lot smarterNow you can control everything in your house, from the TV Command center or the phone app. Imagine the possibilities!Here are just a few things you can do with smart hardware (sold separately)
Smart Lighting
Front Door Lock
Doorbell Cams
Garage Door
Thermostat Control
Window Blinds and Curtains
Multi-room Audio
Appliances
Security cameras
And more!
 Advanced Voice Command TechnologyUnlike some of the other voice command products out there, MAX is completely customizable and will respond to whatever name you teach it. Additionally, MAX will listen to multiple commands like “Open YouTube, Search for How to Play Guitar”. When finished you can say “Thank you” or just say nothing and the voice command function will turn itself off after a few seconds.NOTE: MAX is compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, and also compatible with a wide range of Smart Home products that operate using WiFi, Bluetooth, and Z-Wave. (ZigBee not supported) Expand the power of Voice Commands!We realize that much like Alexa and Google Home, MAX cannot hear you talk to it from every room in the house. For this reason we have developed a Voice Command addon component (sold separately) to give your house the true “Tony Stark” experience. Just plug a Voice addon into any standard wall outlet and MAX will discover it. Now you can give commands from anywhere in the house! MAX Features and Functions

High Speed USB (2) for External Drives/ Stored Media
Ethernet Port
Z-Wave for Smart Home Automation Devices
OTA (Over the Air) HD Antenna Input

<h3>About Boo</h3>
<p>Hi, thank you so much for stopping by! My name is David and I am the founder of Boo Delivery. I am a graphic designer by trade and some of my non-profit works have been for the Jane Goodall Institute. I am now setting out to create my own brand, a tree-free alternative to traditional toilet paper.</p>
<p>My product Boo, is a new subscription-based tree-free toilet paper alternative that I believe will change your life and could make a significant impact on the environment for the better. I recently discovered tree-free toilet paper products at my local grocery store and could honestly not notice the difference. The problem was, it was super overpriced and the company did not do anything for any cause. I'm setting out to not only produce an affordable tree-free toilet paper but, to also give back at the same time. I believe that supporting bamboo-based products is a small switch that could make a HUGE difference on the environment. Paper is out, Bamboo is in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Next-Generation Fiber.</h3>
<p>It can take up to 20-30 years for a normal tree to reach full maturity, then it is cut down to make virgin pulp tissue. Boo is tree-free, to begin with. The organic bamboo pulp used to make Boo is the best alternative because it grows 20 times faster than trees, and does not need to be re-planted after every harvest.</p>
<div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3></div>
<div>
<p>We need $20,000 to make Boo a reality. This will cover our production costs, manufacturing shipping and storage and marketing of the Boo product for its first run.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contributions to Boo will go to finalizing first orders and getting it to our first customers.</li>
<li>$15 will get you a pack of Boo!</li>
<li>I do not have much money but if we do not reach the milestone, I plan to personally put up the remaining start-up costs towards making Boo a reality. In the worst case, I will refund 100% donations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We plan at the start to pledge to give back to threatened ecosystems by 5% sales of every pack of toilet paper sold to 1% for the Planet, American Forests Foundation, and Conservation International. We have this infrastructure already set up on our website. To make this happen we need to get up and running!</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about our pledge to give back to <u><a href=""https://boodelivery.com/pages/our-impact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">these non-profit organizations</a></u>.</li>
<li>Boo is 100% ecologically biodegradable, sustainable and septic-safe. It's really the perfect fiber.</li>
<li>Boo's fulfillment center offsets the environmental impact of its warehouse guaranteeing each shipment is 95% carbon neutral. Learn more <a href=""https://boxzooka.com/environmental-sustainability/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</li>
<li>Know you are doing good by using Boo.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>In full transparency, we are trying to cover our start-up costs for our initial run of toilet-paper. We would love your help in any way. </li>
<li>In the worst case, we will refund 100% donations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>It would be so, so, so, amazing to spread any noise about Boo over social networks. We would be so grateful for any contributions regardless of how small.</li>

The problem was, it was super overpriced and the company did not do anything for any cause. I'm setting out to not only produce an affordable tree-free toilet paper but, to also give back at the same time. I believe that supporting bamboo-based products is a small switch that could make a HUGE difference on the environment. Paper is out, Bamboo is in.

A Next-Generation Fiber.
It can take up to 20-30 years for a normal tree to reach full maturity, then it is cut down to make virgin pulp tissue. Boo is tree-free, to begin with. The organic bamboo pulp used to make Boo is the best alternative because it grows 20 times faster than trees, and does not need to be re-planted after every harvest.
What We Need & What You Get

We need $20,000 to make Boo a reality. This will cover our production costs, manufacturing shipping and storage and marketing of the Boo product for its first run.

Your contributions to Boo will go to finalizing first orders and getting it to our first customers.
$15 will get you a pack of Boo!
I do not have much money but if we do not reach the milestone, I plan to personally put up the remaining start-up costs towards making Boo a reality. In the worst case, I will refund 100% donations.



The Impact
We plan at the start to pledge to give back to threatened ecosystems by 5% sales of every pack of toilet paper sold to 1% for the Planet, American Forests Foundation, and Conservation International. We have this infrastructure already set up on our website. To make this happen we need to get up and running!

Learn more about our pledge to give back to these non-profit organizations.
Boo is 100% ecologically biodegradable, sustainable and septic-safe. It's really the perfect fiber.
Boo's fulfillment center offsets the environmental impact of its warehouse guaranteeing each shipment is 95% carbon neutral. Learn more here.
Know you are doing good by using Boo.


Risks & Challenges

In full transparency, we are trying to cover our start-up costs for our initial run of toilet-paper. We would love your help in any way. 
In the worst case, we will refund 100% donations.


Other Ways You Can Help

It would be so, so, so, amazing to spread any noise about Boo over social networks. We would be so grateful for any contributions regardless of how small.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Donatas. For the last few years I have come to UK for better life, been working as a truck driver in the UK. But it never gave me the inner joy. From an early age, I have enjoyed woodworking and joinery.</p>
<p>About 2 months ago I went back to Lithuania and started making oak and epoxy resin tables and chairs. At the moment I only produce for the local market and well-known customers, everyone is fascinated with my products. However, I hope to find overseas partners who can show and sell my products. For products I use natural aged and dried oak, chestnut, apple wood. I also compose with moss, acorns, coins and anything else you can come up with. I am completely committed to the fantasy of my clients and try to fulfill their wishes (last my work is resin table and chairs with top from beer corks). </p>

<h3>Why this idea?</h3>
<p>Hi, we'd like to welcome you to our page, thank you for considering contributing to our campaign.</p>
<p>So, how did this idea of ours come up? Well, it's quite literally a <i>shower thought.</i><br/>We all know the feeling when during shower time your lost hair gets all wet, tangled, sticky and sticks to your hands. There aren't many options you got, basically you either smear it on the tiles (If you think about it, it's a bit 'Eww')</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501511972/xg9pcpiqwq0qiaxyolrv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>...or you just wash it off and later collect it from the drain protector if you have one (Which is way more 'Ewwww').</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501512035/uyjdccopd4pg0xyatsky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We have designed the HairHanger in a way that allows you to simply run your fingers through it and at the end of your shower just simply discard the tangly hair. (Due to the fact that the hair spends a few minutes drying on the HairHanger, the hair becomes easily disposable). Not only is it more sanitary, its design, small size, and colour choices allow you to fit it into your bathroom interior. In addition to being handy, it can be a cheerful patch of colour to your bathroom.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course, an idea isn't worth much without implementation - and that's where you, the contributors come in.</p>
<p>We have successfully managed to create the design with the help of good friends and engineers, we found the perfect manufacturer, the distributor, but this is as far as we can get without financial support. So far all the contributions - apart from some legal fees - were the courtesy of fellow university students. But in order to be able to mass-produce our product and get it to your doorstep at a low price, we need quite a large minimum order.</p>
<p>So how can you help us? Obviously, by pre-ordering the HairHanger for yourself, your family (or your significant other, we all know you are bothered by all that hair left around). If you cannot contribute, we understand, however if you think this is a cool idea you can help us make it happen just by spreading the word. We would love you to join the campaign and help us make the HairHanger become a reality!</p>
<p>The manufacturing can only begin if the contributions reach the set target. By Indiegogo's policy you carry no risk, it's all on us.</p>
<p>You can choose from the colours below to make sure it matches your bathroom's design:<br/><b>All</b> <strong>White</strong> - Suits most of the bathrooms, <b>All</b> <strong>Black</strong> - If you want something dark<br/><strong>Pink</strong> - Satisfy your inner princess, <strong>Turquoise</strong> - Because why not?<br/>(The following pictures are early renders)</p>

<p>We are Laura and Daniel, two young students from Budapest, studying at the universities of Oxford and ELTE, respectively. We both have long hair, so we know the struggle. One day during shower time in the communal shower of the campus, this idea emerged and we both knew immediately that this idea was worth pursuing. After a few months of planning, consulting with friends, engineers and designers, finding the right manufacturer we finally came to the start of the Indiegogo campaign. We knew that we don't have the financial background to do this on our own, so we decided to turn to the community. We trust that if this idea is worthy to be completed we will have your support.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

There aren't many options you got, basically you either smear it on the tiles (If you think about it, it's a bit 'Eww')

...or you just wash it off and later collect it from the drain protector if you have one (Which is way more 'Ewwww').


 
From now on you have a better option! 

We have designed the HairHanger in a way that allows you to simply run your fingers through it and at the end of your shower just simply discard the tangly hair. (Due to the fact that the hair spends a few minutes drying on the HairHanger, the hair becomes easily disposable). Not only is it more sanitary, its design, small size, and colour choices allow you to fit it into your bathroom interior. In addition to being handy, it can be a cheerful patch of colour to your bathroom.

 
How we got here and what the future holds

 

What We Need & What You Get
Of course, an idea isn't worth much without implementation - and that's where you, the contributors come in.
We have successfully managed to create the design with the help of good friends and engineers, we found the perfect manufacturer, the distributor, but this is as far as we can get without financial support. So far all the contributions - apart from some legal fees - were the courtesy of fellow university students. But in order to be able to mass-produce our product and get it to your doorstep at a low price, we need quite a large minimum order.
So how can you help us? Obviously, by pre-ordering the HairHanger for yourself, your family (or your significant other, we all know you are bothered by all that hair left around). If you cannot contribute, we understand, however if you think this is a cool idea you can help us make it happen just by spreading the word. We would love you to join the campaign and help us make the HairHanger become a reality!
The manufacturing can only begin if the contributions reach the set target. By Indiegogo's policy you carry no risk, it's all on us.
You can choose from the colours below to make sure it matches your bathroom's design:All White - Suits most of the bathrooms, All Black - If you want something darkPink - Satisfy your inner princess, Turquoise - Because why not?(The following pictures are early renders)


 

Meet the inventors

We are Laura and Daniel, two young students from Budapest, studying at the universities of Oxford and ELTE, respectively. We both have long hair, so we know the struggle. One day during shower time in the communal shower of the campus, this idea emerged and we both knew immediately that this idea was worth pursuing. After a few months of planning, consulting with friends, engineers and designers, finding the right manufacturer we finally came to the start of the Indiegogo campaign. We knew that we don't have the financial background to do this on our own, so we decided to turn to the community. We trust that if this idea is worthy to be completed we will have your support.
Thank you very much in advance!
Laura and Daniel

<p><strong>How the story of TomBelt began</strong></p>
<p>When I was living in a student dorm and in smaller apartments there was always a lack of space for a proper storage of clothes and accessories. My belts were lying and hanging literally everywhere. I have couple of them and most of them are leather made. Everyone who owns a leather belt knows that it loses its proper shape and the surface starts to crack if not stored properly.</p>
<p>I searched the Internet how to store my belts but no solution was good enough. Drawers with dividers take too much space and are not suitable for every wardrobe. There are many hangers for belts on the market, but most of them will tilt on one side if you do not maintain a balance. My biggest problem with hangers was that I could not store my favorite type of belts – belts with a pin buckle. </p>
<p>Therefore, I started designing a solution that meets all needs. After several prototypes the TomBelt was born.</p>

<p>Most people do not have supportive furniture in their house, leaving children mold their spines to the shape of a “C” and reinforcing their bad habits encourages the neck and shoulders to roll forward.The problem is that it’s not an obvious disease – it’s a slow and subtle injury that could really affect them in later life. Children can develop bad postural habits from quite an early age. Poor posture is also linked to mood, self-confidence, breathing, digestive problems and stress. It can become a vicious cycle – kids slump.  <strong>Want to know how you can help your children improve posture ? </strong></p>

<p>Zee Smart Controller is the ultimate interface for your home. Manage all your smart home devices from a single device that is always in the same convenient location. The system that can develop and grow with you. Start with one controller and expand as your needs change. Though, once you have one you will soon want one in every room of the house.</p>
<h3><b>What is Zee Smart Controller? </b></h3>
<p> <br/></p>
<div>
<p>Zee Smart Controller is a single device for managing and controlling all your smart devices in your home. Replaces existing light switches and turns your existing lights into ""smart lights"" with advanced control features for everything else. Automate and control multiple devices, schedule functions all from the interactive interface. Simple and minimalist design that's easy to configure and even easier to use.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459110985/hpol81laf0t22bl4xsnl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We identified that existing light switches are typically well located in rooms where you enter or exit a room and would be the ideal location for a smart home interface.  To do that we also needed to replicate or replace the light switch itself as part of the solution.  From there the concept of the Zee Smart Controller was born</span></p>
<h3><b>Smart Lights + Interactive Labels</b></h3>
<p>The Zee Smart Controller is a direct light switch replacement and can replace up to 4 switched circuits in a single Zee Smart Controller, two of which can also dim lights up and down. The other two are relay switches that can be used to switch on an extractor fan or to open your garage door.  Because Zee Smart Controller connects to existing light switch circuits no other rewiring is required for a standard two wire AC circuit homes. Interactive label technology takes the guess work out of which switch does what. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Convergence Technology</b></h3>
<p>Bring it all together in one place with Zee Smart Controller. Do away with multiple controllers and single product apps that can't talk to each other. With one touch control scenes that can set the perfect mood: close the blinds, lights at 50%, warm white and select that perfect playlist for your multi-room audio.</p>
<br/><p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Built in Smart Senses</b></h3>
<p>A truly smart device with not only real time clock features but also temperature and ambient light sensors. Use the temperature sensor like a thermostat to manage heating, cooling and ventilation systems to maximise comfort and minimise cost with home or away modes.</p>
<h3><b>Security</b></h3>
<p>Not only can you interface your Zee Smart Controller into your alarm system, you can also use it to give a ""someone is home"" look even while you are away. Because of Zee Smart's learning features it can apply random algorithms to open/close blinds, turn lights on or off at certain times in certain rooms, turn audio systems on/off just as if you were there.</p>
<h3><b>Internet of Things ""IoT""</b></h3>
<p>Learns, develops and grows using Internet of Things technology (IoT). Configured and backed up in the cloud you are always sure of the latest features. The Zee Smart Controller becomes the ultimate interface for your home. You can control your home from any Zee Controller, or any managed device from the app or your web browser.</p>
<h3><b>Task Scheduling</b></h3>
<p>Zee Smart Controller can even do the boring stuff clever. Use the built-in scheduling functions to control when pool pumps and heaters should come on or when to water the garden. Using smart inputs you can make sure the pool heater isn't on when the power price is high, or water the garden when it's raining.</p>
<h3><b>Distributed Architecture</b></h3>
<p>Our unique distributed architecture does away with the need for a central controller.  Each Zee Smart Controller can operate independently or as part of a cluster of Zee Smart Controllers.  This means you can start with one and grow your system as your needs or budget allows.  It also means that in the unlikely event you have an issue with a controller your whole home doesn't go offline.</p>

<h2>Prototype Development and Timeline</h2>
<h3><b>Prototype</b></h3>
<p>We know this product works and have built a proof of concept working prototype but we have a lot of work to do still which is why we need the help of the IndieGoGo community to take the prototype into a product suitable for commercial release.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457328786/ztlrktx3extobe61zvxa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The key differences between this prototype and the production version we are working on will be:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Larger LCD display of 5""</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Two component parts, the mains side and the user interface side</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Coloured front glass with capacitive touch screen interface.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are keeping the design as simple as possible.  There will be no front facing screws so need to keep the mains component secured inside the the wall with a simple plug and magnetic hold for the controller interface. A clean glass front surface with the temperature sensor hidden in the side and the light and proximity sensors facing forward behind the glass. </p>
<h3><b>Timeline</b></h3>
<p>Following a successful Indiegogo campaign we will focus all our efforts into refining our product for commercial release.  Having being through several prototype designs to prove the concept we know what works and what doesn't and are confident on an early 2017 delivery. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457405936/eyjknz5tcomtwieszkkd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>We know how important it is for us to fulfil our promise to you, our backers, and deliver Zee Smart Controller on time and as described.</p>
<p>We believe the product we have come up with is unique and new, and with that comes challenges. We identified the need to make home automation a reality for everyone and believe products today are fragmented, complicated and expensive which we don't think is smart.</p>
<p>Our vision is a product that can manage all smart devices in the home but recognise some products will be harder to support than others. We have coined the phrase ""convergence technology"" for the home as we seek to develop an interface and platform for managing the home environment.</p>
<p>We also identified existing homes as a critical market and that any solution must work with existing home wiring set-ups.

</div></div>","Zee Summary 
Zee Smart Controller is the ultimate interface for your home. Manage all your smart home devices from a single device that is always in the same convenient location. The system that can develop and grow with you. Start with one controller and expand as your needs change. Though, once you have one you will soon want one in every room of the house.
What is Zee Smart Controller? 
 

Zee Smart Controller is a single device for managing and controlling all your smart devices in your home. Replaces existing light switches and turns your existing lights into ""smart lights"" with advanced control features for everything else. Automate and control multiple devices, schedule functions all from the interactive interface. Simple and minimalist design that's easy to configure and even easier to use.




We identified that existing light switches are typically well located in rooms where you enter or exit a room and would be the ideal location for a smart home interface.  To do that we also needed to replicate or replace the light switch itself as part of the solution.  From there the concept of the Zee Smart Controller was born
Smart Lights + Interactive Labels
The Zee Smart Controller is a direct light switch replacement and can replace up to 4 switched circuits in a single Zee Smart Controller, two of which can also dim lights up and down. The other two are relay switches that can be used to switch on an extractor fan or to open your garage door.  Because Zee Smart Controller connects to existing light switch circuits no other rewiring is required for a standard two wire AC circuit homes. Interactive label technology takes the guess work out of which switch does what. 






Convergence Technology
Bring it all together in one place with Zee Smart Controller. Do away with multiple controllers and single product apps that can't talk to each other. With one touch control scenes that can set the perfect mood: close the blinds, lights at 50%, warm white and select that perfect playlist for your multi-room audio.




Built in Smart Senses
A truly smart device with not only real time clock features but also temperature and ambient light sensors. Use the temperature sensor like a thermostat to manage heating, cooling and ventilation systems to maximise comfort and minimise cost with home or away modes.
Security
Not only can you interface your Zee Smart Controller into your alarm system, you can also use it to give a ""someone is home"" look even while you are away. Because of Zee Smart's learning features it can apply random algorithms to open/close blinds, turn lights on or off at certain times in certain rooms, turn audio systems on/off just as if you were there.
Internet of Things ""IoT""
Learns, develops and grows using Internet of Things technology (IoT). Configured and backed up in the cloud you are always sure of the latest features. The Zee Smart Controller becomes the ultimate interface for your home. You can control your home from any Zee Controller, or any managed device from the app or your web browser.
Task Scheduling
Zee Smart Controller can even do the boring stuff clever. Use the built-in scheduling functions to control when pool pumps and heaters should come on or when to water the garden. Using smart inputs you can make sure the pool heater isn't on when the power price is high, or water the garden when it's raining.
Distributed Architecture
Our unique distributed architecture does away with the need for a central controller.  Each Zee Smart Controller can operate independently or as part of a cluster of Zee Smart Controllers.  This means you can start with one and grow your system as your needs or budget allows.  It also means that in the unlikely event you have an issue with a controller your whole home doesn't go offline.

Prototype Development and Timeline
Prototype
We know this product works and have built a proof of concept working prototype but we have a lot of work to do still which is why we need the help of the IndieGoGo community to take the prototype into a product suitable for commercial release.

The key differences between this prototype and the production version we are working on will be:



Larger LCD display of 5""


Two component parts, the mains side and the user interface side


Coloured front glass with capacitive touch screen interface.


We are keeping the design as simple as possible.  There will be no front facing screws so need to keep the mains component secured inside the the wall with a simple plug and magnetic hold for the controller interface. A clean glass front surface with the temperature sensor hidden in the side and the light and proximity sensors facing forward behind the glass. 
Timeline
Following a successful Indiegogo campaign we will focus all our efforts into refining our product for commercial release.  Having being through several prototype designs to prove the concept we know what works and what doesn't and are confident on an early 2017 delivery. 


Risks and challenges
We know how important it is for us to fulfil our promise to you, our backers, and deliver Zee Smart Controller on time and as described.
We believe the product we have come up with is unique and new, and with that comes challenges. We identified the need to make home automation a reality for everyone and believe products today are fragmented, complicated and expensive which we don't think is smart.
Our vision is a product that can manage all smart devices in the home but recognise some products will be harder to support than others. We have coined the phrase ""convergence technology"" for the home as we seek to develop an interface and platform for managing the home environment.
We also identified existing homes as a critical market and that any solution must work with existing home wiring set-ups. We selected WiFi as the standard communication platform, while not perfect in every home is getting better all the time and we didn't want to introduce new complexity into our system. We believe WiFi can be made stable to ensure high reliability. For those who love wires we will also include a wired Ethernet option.
We have already made a few prototypes and know we can make this work but taking a product from proof on concept to production requires a lot of effort. As our product connects into mains wiring we also need to do all the testing and certification prior to delivery. We have already conducted initial validation of our design with a recognised testing laboratory and already know we are on the right track.
Developing the on-line experience to continually deliver updates and support for additional products is a daunting but necessary task. We see the cloud based system for managing and configuring the Zee Smart Controller as one of the critical elements to ensure a quality experience. The cloud based system we see as something that will continually develop, grow and evolve over time.

Live with the knowledge that you helped cats and became a fashion icon.

-Why Purrfect Paws?-

Purrfect Paws is unlike any other product on the market. Unlike nail caps, Purrfect Paws doesn't require you to use superglue on your cat. To apply Purrfect Paws, you simply dip your cat's nails into the solution and it dries in under a minute. Since Purrfect Paws is a liquid, it will conform perfectly to the size and shape of your cat's nails. It'll be a perfect fit every time, and you will never accidentally superglue yourself to your cat ever again.
-Thank You-

And we are here to change that, change the way you think of nursery furniture. Here we introduce you to a long-lasting solution for the smallest ones. This all-natural birch wood multi-use crib not only rocks your newborn to a safe sleep, it grows with your family to become a cot bed and a rocking horse that will last for years of play. The crib converts to a toy box for maximum storage, and the reversible, detachable blackboard constantly encourages creativity. I'll explain each of these options a bit more here.1. Swinging cradle.  For about the first six months of life, your baby can gently and naturally rock to sleep in this convenient mini crib/baby cradle swing; all you need is a 40x80cm mattress. The rocking motion is a tried and true way to lull your infant to a sound sleep and give you the parent the respite you deserve.2.Crib You can use the swinging crib until your baby can lift him/herself from the sleeping surface. At that point, the swinging motion should be disabled entirely for safety reasons (it takes only a minute).  But no worries, your baby can go on sleeping in the crib until it gets too small - and still, it is not the end of the story. The crib turns into a toy box, and its design will fit to most interiors.3. Toy storageAfter your baby outgrows the cradle, you can use it as a toy box to keep all those toys tidy. The toy box even allows you to store toys without continually opening the lid. 4.BlackboardThe nifty detachable, reversible chalkboard is there to encourage expression while keeping the walls clean. It's an outlet your child can use again and again.5. Rocking horseThe rocking horse is suitable for all ages; it withstood our tests with a 100kg man, so it promises years of fun. And if you add one more child, they can take advantage of the rocking cradle at the same time.There have been many great products on Indiegogo that are made by reusing old materials giving them a new life, and so reducing unnecessary spending. We have taken the other approach - by adding more functions to our furniture, we add longer lifetime and reduce the ecological footprint. We have already gotten some feedback from our customers, and it truly is encouraging : Lovely cradle with lots of additional featuresThis cradle is beautifully made and of great quality. Not only is it comfortable for our baby to sleep in, but it's also very stylish. The assembly was extremely quick and easy without any screwdrivers required. The cradle comes with a blackboard which doesn't have to be attached straight away (or can be, if there are older siblings that might want to use it). Overall a great product and I highly recommend it.Well made and sturdy, nice finishPurchased for a friend's first baby boy, as with most cribs the mattress was purchased separately. It was easy to assemble as long as you follow the instructions, Prices are well finished and fit as they are supposed to. It's a lovely little rocking horse and is very sturdy. At 4 months old he's in a cot now and it's already filling with toys.  About us a bit. My name is Risto, and I am taking care of international sales in our family company, Adensen Furniture. We are from Estonia - you know, the small European country where Skype and Transferwise originate. The creator of our nursery furniture sets is Heiki, my father. He is a father of six - I see a clear connection here when we talk about how he came to these ingenious ideas in furniture development. We began to produce multi-functional furniture around 2008, got some lovely feedback from the customers, and have been going on in that direction ever since. It's a no-brainer for many parents - instead of buying one piece of furniture, you get many more options on how to use it.  You don't need to dread what to do with all the furniture that needs to be changed several times before your baby gets to teenage.Even though we've been around awhile, we haven't managed to get our products to a broader audience. Here today, we are asking you to help us spread the word about what we do and check out one of our most beautiful products.  The History The first version of The Swinging Crib and The Rocking Horse is from the year 2008 - here is an old picture of my co-worker and me together with The Horse in our old factory - taken by a local newspaper photographer (that's me on the right). Initially, The Crib didn't look so good, almost like a wooden box (see below).By re-designing the cradle, making it more open, we got a beautiful little crib accompanied by the faithful horse :  What We Need & What You Get Our products are unique in more ways than one. But it is also more expensive to produce multi-functional furniture. The higher price point makes it more difficult for us to sell our long-lasting products. So we took a look at our production, and after spending some time considering the various options, we found the lowest hanging fruit, as far as making our products cheaper goes : Today we outsource the production. To reduce the price in the best possible way, we should bring one part of production in-house. For that, we will need to purchase some smaller woodworking machines (edge sander, spindle sander, router, portable spindle sander), and exactly that is why we are asking your help today. Our thought process went as followsThe workflow is in three stages :CNC work. All the details for The Swinging Crib and The Rocking Horse and most of the details for Adensen Smart, our two nursery furniture sets, are cut out on a CNC router. It is expensive, especially when we are not ordering many units at the time, but we really can't avoid it - the nature of the product requires it. The prices for CNC routers suitable for us begin from around 10000 EUR.Manually preparing the products for painting: this is time-consuming but one of the most critical parts of the workflow. We will check over all the details and smooth all the sharp corners and edges so that the product is safe and feels pleasant to touch.

We know how to do it, but we don't have the equipment. The 6700 EUR we need for purchasing the machine is the goal for us today (there will be taxes reduced from 6700 EUR) Your help will be invaluable. Should you tell a friend, share our campaign in social media, pledge or even get one of our unique nursery furniture sets yourself - either way, we are grateful and always will be. We have two different furniture sets as perks, both are one of a kind, and there is nothing like this out there today)   The GoalOur goal is to give you furniture that has meaning; you could even say - personality. And by doing that we make life easier for the parents, improve the quality of life for children, make the world greener. If we can deliver our message of long-lasting furniture to more people, we can reduce unnecessary spending, one crib at the time.   Risks & ChallengesSelling big and bulky products has many challenges.The main issue to solve is transport.

About me and Post Scriptum</h2><h3>How did it all start?</h3><p>Ok. So after watching a popular tv series “Ghost whisperer” as a child, I wanted to have skills like the main character. Talking to dead people and helping them with their unfinished business sounds like a great profession, doesn’t it? For years I’ve been wanting to code my own project. I’ve always had a head full of ideas but never had the time to realize these ideas. So finally, after hitting rock bottom of a comfortable 9-5 job I decided to finally fulfill my dreams. And that’s when I decided to combine my dream from when I was a child and my programming skills. Thus began my journey of Post Scriptum.

I want to check if there’s any interest in this kind of service. The thing is that it’s just me and my idea. You are on your side of the screen and on the other side it’s just me. Not some big team.

<h3>Why join the BYO (Bring your Own) container movement. ♻️</h3>
<p>We get it. Plastic takeaway containers are convenient. Cheap. And easy to discard. But at the same time, they're identified as one of the key contributor of plastic waste increasingly being dumped into our oceans. A study estimates 2025 million takeaway containers are being used per year in the EU alone.</p>
<h3> Our MISSION. Our Takeaway Dream. ? ?</h3>
<p>Our dream is to have a disposable-free takeaway future. A future where sustainable alternatives such as Final Bowl are given a chance over single use plastic takeaway containers. This is alongside initiatives such as Trashless Takeaway that promote the BYO movement among food establishments as a means to combat single use containers.  </p>

</div></div>","Why join the BYO (Bring your Own) container movement. ♻️
We get it. Plastic takeaway containers are convenient. Cheap. And easy to discard. But at the same time, they're identified as one of the key contributor of plastic waste increasingly being dumped into our oceans. A study estimates 2025 million takeaway containers are being used per year in the EU alone.
 Our MISSION. Our Takeaway Dream. ? ?
Our dream is to have a disposable-free takeaway future. A future where sustainable alternatives such as Final Bowl are given a chance over single use plastic takeaway containers. This is alongside initiatives such as Trashless Takeaway that promote the BYO movement among food establishments as a means to combat single use containers.

<p>The pieces are <strong>assembled without glues, nails or screws</strong>, thereby promoting its <b>reuse</b> and later <b>recycling</b>. As well, the simple design and snap-fit assemblage reveals an educational and <b>joyful</b> experience for children and grown-ups.<br/>
The stool isn't a pain to put together like other ready-to-assemble furniture. It is assembled or taken apart in less than <b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">30 seconds</span></b>! <br/> 
It features a handle on one of its legs and is very practical to take, to travel or to store away with its reusable packaging when not needed.<br/>
With a smooth safe design it aims boosting the understanding of the constructive logic by children.<b> <span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Therein lies its educational and playful power.</span></b></p>

<p>With these products one also takes a <strong>story to tell</strong> to others. Especially to the ones that will continue our work – <b>the children</b>! We want them to also be an environmental entrepreneur along with PLY&amp;co.!<br/>
<b>Kids love to safely interact with it.</b> And the cork stool is pretty much <strong><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">damage-proof</span></strong>. Its child-friendliness and safety indeed invite kids to hang around with it, finding a restful friend when tired of playing…!</p>

<p>The amount of packaging is reduced as well, making it possible to go with the SIT'ABIT anywhere. Take it outdoors and enjoy the lawn even when it’s wet.</p>

<p>*We know it doesn’t look a huge improvement nor we'll put an USB slot anywhere, but it does require Research &amp; Development to achieve what many grow-up’s ask from us: <br/>
<b>Smart simplicity ! </b>Just having this cool and friendly <span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>cork stool made bigger! </b></span></p>
<p><b>BUT WHY WE CANT MAKE IT RIGHT NOW ?</b><br/>
Cork is a durable yet flexible material. In order to have stability we improved
the thickness of the actual stool's parts to 25mm, to safely carry the weight
of a person up to 70kg. But to extend the height 10cm more, from 35 to 45cm and the load up to 120kg we need time and testing to achieve it, without losing our simple, affordable and honest concept.<br/>
That’s what we’ll aim for, giving our funders the opportunity to <strong>buy it later at an astonishing launching price !</strong></p>

<p>As designers with years of experience, we know that every project comes with risks... However, since we already produced some small runs, there is little ones associated with
managing a bigger production.<br/>
Bigger risk would actually be a HUGE amount of orders, while a blessing it could also cause some delays. In order to overcome that as soon as we acquire success to order large quantities, we'll secure a safe place at our suppliers agenda.<br/>

</div><div>
<p><b>What are the dimensions and weight of the SIT'ABITs?</b><br/>
<strong>SIT’ABIT Cork jr.</strong> mm: W260 x L260 x H350 / in: 10,23”x10,23”x13,77” weight 2,4kg /5,28lbs<br/>
<strong>SIT’ABIT </strong>adult size mm: W300 x L300 x H450 / in: 11,81”x11,81”x17,71” weight 3,3kg / 7,26lbs<br/>
<b>SIT’ABIT HIGH</b> mm: W300 x L300 x H750 / in: 11,81”x11,81”x29,53” weight 5kg / 11,02lbs</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Is the SITABIT waterproof?</strong><br/>
				It has been designed without electronic components to hassle you. Therefore it withstands harsh environments and weather conditions. As any wooden piece shouldn’t be left wet for long. A dry cloth will do it, the Cork version even comes with a fine sandpaper to remove stains or scribbles. Easy, safe and simple.</p>
<p><strong>Can I keep my stools shiny and new?</strong><br/>
As long as you’re not the kind of person that can’t tell a pair of pliers from a screwdriver you will.<br/>
The finishings are either RAW (fine sanding, varnishes free), ECO (natural waxes and oils) or ECO-Dur (water based matt varnish). The first 2 are totally DIY maintainable and the 3rd only goes over the birch plywood and is stronger yet very easy to renew if deeply scratched.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>I'm 1,80m / 6""4, Can the stool be bigger?</strong><br/>
Besides the 2 SIZES - Junior (Cork) and Adult (Birch) - we have a fine barstool version that you can order, benefiting from your 20% discount, and making sure you’ll be the master of entertaining among your friends. </p>
<h4><strong><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">PRODUCTION</span></strong></h4>
<p><strong>Where are the SIT’ABIT made?</strong><br/>
				100% produced in Portugal. <br/>
95% of the raw material is Portuguese and the rest is from Europe. <br/>
We want Children to only PLAY WITH, not DOING THEM.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong><br/>
				Yes, we offer a standard 2 years warranty against manufacturer’s defects. (but the fact that our products are free from messy High-Tech features gives us confidence to assure you a flawless product).</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>* Important:</b> The finishing process lends itself to small variations. Those just highlight
the artisanal nature of the project, as each SIT’ABIT is finished by hand and
absolutely unique, just like the trees are.<br/>
<b>** Outside the E.U.?</b> Please
be aware that certain items may be subject to import duties. As far as we
know, this shouldn't be a problem with our items but we thought it’s worth
mentioning. Please inform yourself.</p>
<h4><strong><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">RESSELERS</span></strong></h4>

Please consider the RESELLERS PACK (and you can double your pledge at any level to order a larger number of SITABITs !). <br/>

<p><b>How much does shipping cost? Why added?</b><br/>
Often more than we wish, sometimes a lot. <br/>
International shipping is not an easy job. We've been working hard to get the better conditions of shipping to various countries.<br/>
You must check the Shipping Cost listed in the SHIPPING ZONES and COST TABLES.<br/>
It can be a hassle, but don’t despair, please check our Saver Packs and you’ll see why we were born to travel!<br/>
We could simply level up the shipping costs and include them in the perk value, raising it. That just wouldn’t be fair. But check this next FAQ…</p>
<p><b>Shipping to US, Canada and others (Zones 4 and 5 – see table above)</b><br/>
The more we sell the lower this figure will become, it will not go up. <br/>
We won't change the value but we’ll be more than glad to compensate you later in face of success! That may mean adding an <b>AMAZING TREAT</b> that doesn’t increase the shipping, such as our <b><b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">100% organic cotton, hand-made Tote Bag !</span></b></b> - Retail value of 15€ (20 USD)</p>
<p><strong>When are the perks expected to ship?</strong><br/>
As soon as the campaign gives us “thumbs up” we'll be set to immediately start producing.<br/>
First to fund first to get it. Priority will be given to first funders and, among those, to the resellers.<br/>
We expect to begin shipping yet in November 2015. Not all perks will be shipped this soon, as we will ship in the order that purchases are received.</p>

<p>A <b>PLY&amp;co.</b> é uma marca de <b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">mobiliário ecológico</span></b>, de produção 100% portuguesa, que utiliza madeiras e derivados, provenientes de florestas geridas de forma <b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">sustentável</span></b> e com certificação, tais como, o <b>contraplacado de bétula, o Valchromat® e a cortiça portuguesa</b>.<br/>
O conceito base da PLYco. é composto por uma <b>‘história’</b> de consciência ambiental que se revela em cada opção tomada desde a concepção das peças até à satisfação dos nossos clientes, passando por princípios como a <b>minimização do desperdício</b> de matérias-primas ou o <b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">acabamento</span></b>, aplicado integralmente à mão por <b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">artesãos tradicionais</span></b>, recorrendo sempre a produtos ecológicos.</p>

<p>*Sabemos que não parece uma grande melhoria nem iremos colocar uma slot USB em nenhuma parte do banco, mas exige Pesquisa &amp; Desenvolvimento para alcançar o que muitos dos nossos seguidores nos pedem:<br/>
<b>Smart Simplicity !</b> Produzir este adorável<b><span style=""color: rgb(235, 20, 120); font-family: montserrat, Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> banco de cortiça em tamanho adulto!</span></b></p>
<p><b>E POR QUE AINDA NÃO O FIZEMOS?</b><br/>
A cortiça é um material resistente, mas flexível. A fim de ter uma boa estabilidade aumentamos a espessura das peças do actual banco SIT’ABIT CORK Jr. para 25 mm, de modo a aguentar com segurança o peso de uma pessoa até 70 kg. Mas, para crescer em altura de 35 para 45 centímetros (+ 10 cm) e a carga até 120 kg precisamos de tempo e ensaios para o garantir sem perder o nosso conceito simples e ecológico.<br/>

PLY&co. is a Portuguese brand of ecological furniture established in Porto, Portugal, that only uses woods and derivatives from sustainably managed forests, namely birch plywood, Valchromat® and Portuguese cork.

Our concept minimizes the waste of the raw materials and promotes an entirely manual finishing, with ecologic products, by traditional craftsmen.







The raw materials used and fittings were reduced to the maximum, so that all the pieces are born of the same board. The few “leftovers” go for recycling and saw dust for energy producing. 
We bring you here on Indiegogo our small big idea - the SIT'ABIT !


SIT'ABIT is not just a stool. 
It is made from wood, without chopping forests down! A cool piece of furniture crafted with individual care and holding a story to tell.
Composed by just 3 pieces that fit together at a shake of a lamb’s tail: no glue, nails or screws, nor any tools for setting it up! 



For example, the SIT’ABIT Cork Jr. is a seriously playful and ecological children’s stool, made of this unique natural material, resistant yet soft, that is cork, is a didactic yet funny piece. 


Dismountable it allows flexibility of use, easy storage and the transportation costs get reduced.

Take it in our 100% organic cotton, hand-made Tote Bag anywhere you go !
It will be yours with perks above 50€ !

We eliminated all complexity, resulting in a minimal form that holds elegant simplicity while being a friend of Nature. SIT'ABIT is a cool, remarkable product that will catches the eye… and  conveys a story that matters to all.























We are ""on the market"" for sometime now, acquiring great applause and continuous reconaissance from our peers and national public but we want to deliver more to the most!
This means showing our work to the world, starting here on Indiegogo !
If successful, we'll take it to selected fairs and exhibitions, for which we are often invited to, but can´t afford the cost!
And to reach this we need the usual: a bigger production run that enables us to negotiate the best prices with our local suppliers and optimize logistics, rewarding your support and attaining cash-flow to do the following...




... we need a certain amount of orders that ensures us a minimum production to deliver more at the best prices ! 
By helping us in this process, we'll continue supporting the pretty much depleted local economy, ensuring the jobs of the people that make PLY&co.

We want to ensure our future productions run efficiently, maximizing sustainability, by providing work to us and our local specialized wood-workers, that are living not-so-easy times.
What we do are not just more stuff with a function; above all they must symbolize an attitude towards the planet and towards life. You see, we love design, yet we live simple and sustainable lifestyles that keep us in touch with our roots right here in Portugal, taking care in producing individual, hand crafted, versatile pieces that, above all, connect us back to Nature!










- buying the best quality materials; 
- placing a substantial order to the CNC-milling providers; 
- paying for local craftsmen to finish it; 
- making our reduced packaging customized (manual silk screen print);
- delivering your stool(s) to you.
Then, we'll conquer the world! :-) If you value us, there are a lot more that probably will too.
The web is great, but we must go physical too. We named it: trade shows and international exhibitions !













Pretty much like the lambs wool the cork is the bark of this peculiar Mediterranean tree: the sobreiro (cork oak).

The bark is peeled without harming the tree - which actually becomes stronger and healthier after each crop - by specialized labourers every 9 years. 
The Portuguese Montado has the biggest number of cork oaks in the world, whereas strong legislation monitors the keeping of this legacy.

Cork has great thermal, acoustic and water repellent characteristics besides its cozy touch and looks. A material that keeps the best wines and champagnes ageing for better speaks for itself.


In order to make this possible, accurate snap-fit assembling, achieved through CAD/CAM technology is the base of the craftsmen’s work that hand-finish each piece, with local artisans and non-toxic products, giving our furniture its character but also an actual good fit and ability for the user to maintain it.





 





The pieces are assembled without glues, nails or screws, thereby promoting its reuse and later recycling. As well, the simple design and snap-fit assemblage reveals an educational and joyful experience for children and grown-ups.
The stool isn't a pain to put together like other ready-to-assemble furniture. It is assembled or taken apart in less than 30 seconds!  
It features a handle on one of its legs and is very practical to take, to travel or to store away with its reusable packaging when not needed.
With a smooth safe design it aims boosting the understanding of the constructive logic by children. Therein lies its educational and playful power.


With these products one also takes a story to tell to others. Especially to the ones that will continue our work – the children! We want them to also be an environmental entrepreneur along with PLY&co.!
Kids love to safely interact with it. And the cork stool is pretty much damage-proof. Its child-friendliness and safety indeed invite kids to hang around with it, finding a restful friend when tired of playing…!

The amount of packaging is reduced as well, making it possible to go with the SIT'ABIT anywhere. Take it outdoors and enjoy the lawn even when it’s wet.


















It’s not about intricate high-tech features but how simple things can connect us back to Nature and to each other. 




Richness comes with the Storytelling of the sustainable process behind stuff!










""The attitude that PLY&co. introduced in the market and design panorama has a curious freshness. The combination of traditional Portuguese materials with an essential design, pure and elegant, are pramount in these products. The practical forms they declare are an example of how well-made objects can be an indispensable tool in our day-to-day. "" 
Roberto Cremascoli, architectCurator of the Remade in Portugal
""Cork is an exemplary material in the area of sustainability for being a natural product, renewable and recyclable. The conception of the SIT'ABIT stool matches perfectly with the whole cork logic: nothing is wasted, everything is transformed!""
Lino Rocha
Amorim Cork Composites Manager
""The stool found a great spot in my apartment. It feels good to see people that truly believe in their project, especially when these are beautiful.
I didn't expect to find this in a music festival and it was a really good surprise.Thank you very much!""Mathieu Bonnin, client from Paris, France


""The SIT’ABIT stools are super! They're perfect for the adults and the children in our house and I'm a huge fan of the photo frames.
I love the shape and design, I have 3 now, all different colours but due to the unifying design they work really well together.Thanks again!""Claire Ransom, client from the UK














Any doubts about the shipping to your country, please CONTACT US !   goeasy@plyeco.com




Our flat-pack concept always pays off when contributing more!
Engage your friends on this campaign and save more ! 
> Please check the PACK perks, nr. 7, 8, 10 and 11 above !




It's easy to carry, even as aircraft cabin luggage ! 
Local pick-up available to all !
Travel to Porto and reduce the footprint - Pay us a visit, take it with you and save more, taking also a bio tote-bag for free (or the paid shipping cost in equivalent perks value).
A win-win situation.


• We aim to deliver all items before December, the date will depend on how many stools are ordered, if we can do it faster, we will.
Note: priority will be given to first funders and, among those, to the resellers



*We know it doesn’t look a huge improvement nor we'll put an USB slot anywhere, but it does require Research & Development to achieve what many grow-up’s ask from us: 
Smart simplicity ! Just having this cool and friendly cork stool made bigger! 
BUT WHY WE CANT MAKE IT RIGHT NOW ?
Cork is a durable yet flexible material. In order to have stability we improved
the thickness of the actual stool's parts to 25mm, to safely carry the weight
of a person up to 70kg. But to extend the height 10cm more, from 35 to 45cm and the load up to 120kg we need time and testing to achieve it, without losing our simple, affordable and honest concept.
That’s what we’ll aim for, giving our funders the opportunity to buy it later at an astonishing launching price !









We are architects and designers that love good design and healthy living.



As designers with years of experience, we know that every project comes with risks... However, since we already produced some small runs, there is little ones associated with
managing a bigger production.
Bigger risk would actually be a HUGE amount of orders, while a blessing it could also cause some delays. In order to overcome that as soon as we acquire success to order large quantities, we'll secure a safe place at our suppliers agenda.
And we will always be transparent and keep everyone appraised about the progress of things.






 “…to connect craftsmanship with the industrial process so that you can have some imperfections, more human touch in the product, so that people also connect themselves with it. Craftsmanship in a product shows that a design is about human condition, is about daily life.”
Hella Jongerius



Thank you so much for supporting us growing ! 











CHARACTERISTICS

What are the dimensions and weight of the SIT'ABITs?
SIT’ABIT Cork jr. mm: W260 x L260 x H350 / in: 10,23”x10,23”x13,77” weight 2,4kg /5,28lbs
SIT’ABIT adult size mm: W300 x L300 x H450 / in: 11,81”x11,81”x17,71” weight 3,3kg / 7,26lbs
SIT’ABIT HIGH mm: W300 x L300 x H750 / in: 11,81”x11,81”x29,53” weight 5kg / 11,02lbs


Is the SITABIT waterproof?
				It has been designed without electronic components to hassle you. Therefore it withstands harsh environments and weather conditions. As any wooden piece shouldn’t be left wet for long. A dry cloth will do it, the Cork version even comes with a fine sandpaper to remove stains or scribbles. Easy, safe and simple.
Can I keep my stools shiny and new?
As long as you’re not the kind of person that can’t tell a pair of pliers from a screwdriver you will.
The finishings are either RAW (fine sanding, varnishes free), ECO (natural waxes and oils) or ECO-Dur (water based matt varnish). The first 2 are totally DIY maintainable and the 3rd only goes over the birch plywood and is stronger yet very easy to renew if deeply scratched.

I'm 1,80m / 6""4, Can the stool be bigger?
Besides the 2 SIZES - Junior (Cork) and Adult (Birch) - we have a fine barstool version that you can order, benefiting from your 20% discount, and making sure you’ll be the master of entertaining among your friends. 
PRODUCTION
Where are the SIT’ABIT made?
				100% produced in Portugal. 
95% of the raw material is Portuguese and the rest is from Europe. 
We want Children to only PLAY WITH, not DOING THEM.

Is there a warranty?
				Yes, we offer a standard 2 years warranty against manufacturer’s defects. (but the fact that our products are free from messy High-Tech features gives us confidence to assure you a flawless product).

* Important: The finishing process lends itself to small variations. Those just highlight
the artisanal nature of the project, as each SIT’ABIT is finished by hand and
absolutely unique, just like the trees are.
** Outside the E.U.? Please
be aware that certain items may be subject to import duties. As far as we
know, this shouldn't be a problem with our items but we thought it’s worth
mentioning. Please inform yourself.
RESSELERS
I run a business and would like to resell the SITABIT, what should I do?
Briefly: head on! 
Please consider the RESELLERS PACK (and you can double your pledge at any level to order a larger number of SITABITs !). 
If you are a reseller and want to get more than one 10x SIT'ABIT Cork Jr. Stool RESELLERS PACK, please contact us (goeasy@plyeco.com) to know about especially advantageous shipping costs for more than 10 SIT’ABITs.
Who can choose the Reseller Pack?
				The Reseller Pack is only for resellers with a VAT ID number (e-store, retail shop, design center, museum shop,etc...).

Does the Reseller Pack include VAT?
No. This perk is taxed at 0% VAT for all countries except Portugal. 
Resellers from Portugal please add 96€ to the 10x SIT'ABIT Cork Jr. Stool RESELLERS PACK for VAT.  > Perk: 420€  + Additional gift: 96€ = 516€

SHIPPING + PAYMENT

Is international shipping included?
No, except for the SIT’ABIT mini. 
We use major courier companies, so the shipping is available worldwide to most perks. Remember our flat-pack concept always pays off when getting multiple > please check PACK perks !


Note: The payment method used in Indiegogo is the PayPal. So, if you already have an account, you know how it works. Just ""Log in to your PayPal account"".


If you don´t have a Paypal account, don't worry! You can use it as one time only in ""Pay with a credit or debit card"",  without paying extra fees. Or just create a Free Paypal Account.



Don't forget to un-check the option PayPal sign up, and choose ""Continue without logging in"". Then, finish the payment.


 




How much does shipping cost? Why added?
Often more than we wish, sometimes a lot. 
International shipping is not an easy job. We've been working hard to get the better conditions of shipping to various countries.
You must check the Shipping Cost listed in the SHIPPING ZONES and COST TABLES.
It can be a hassle, but don’t despair, please check our Saver Packs and you’ll see why we were born to travel!
We could simply level up the shipping costs and include them in the perk value, raising it. That just wouldn’t be fair. But check this next FAQ…
Shipping to US, Canada and others (Zones 4 and 5 – see table above)
The more we sell the lower this figure will become, it will not go up. 
We won't change the value but we’ll be more than glad to compensate you later in face of success! That may mean adding an AMAZING TREAT that doesn’t increase the shipping, such as our 100% organic cotton, hand-made Tote Bag ! - Retail value of 15€ (20 USD)
When are the perks expected to ship?
As soon as the campaign gives us “thumbs up” we'll be set to immediately start producing.
First to fund first to get it. Priority will be given to first funders and, among those, to the resellers.
We expect to begin shipping yet in November 2015. Not all perks will be shipped this soon, as we will ship in the order that purchases are received.
I can't find an answer to my question on this page, what should i do?

A PLY&co. é uma marca de mobiliário ecológico, de produção 100% portuguesa, que utiliza madeiras e derivados, provenientes de florestas geridas de forma sustentável e com certificação, tais como, o contraplacado de bétula, o Valchromat® e a cortiça portuguesa.
O conceito base da PLYco. é composto por uma ‘história’ de consciência ambiental que se revela em cada opção tomada desde a concepção das peças até à satisfação dos nossos clientes, passando por princípios como a minimização do desperdício de matérias-primas ou o acabamento, aplicado integralmente à mão por artesãos tradicionais, recorrendo sempre a produtos ecológicos.




As matérias-primas e acessórios foram reduzidos ao máximo, pelo que todas as peças nascem da mesma placa. As poucas ""sobras"" são recicladas, integrando outros projectos e o serrim também serve para produzir energia.
Trazemos-lhe aqui no INDIEGOGO a nossa pequena grande ideia - o SIT'ABIT !


O SIT'ABIT não é apenas um banco!
É uma peça de mobiliário sofisticada, trabalhada e acabada individual e manualmente, que traz consigo uma historia para contar.
O banco SIT’ABIT é constituído por 3 peças que se encaixam num piscar-de-olhos: sem colas, pregos ou parafusos nem quaisquer ferramentas para o montar!




O banco SIT'ABIT Cork Jr., por exemplo, foi concebido para as crianças, com uma forte componente lúdica e ecológica e é totalmente feito em cortiça - um material natural, simultaneamente resistente e macio.



Com possibilidade de aplicar a diversos usos, desmontável e de armazenamento fácil, reduz os custos de transporte.Leve-o no nosso Tote-bag feito à mão com algodão 100% orgânico, para onde quer que vá !Será seu em recompensas superiores a 50€ !
Acreditamos que estamos perante um produto notável de simplicidade da forma com um bom equilíbrio entre a elegância e a preocupação ambiental. Adapta-se facilmente à sua decoração, levando consigo uma história que interessa a todos.



















Estamos ‘no mercado’ há algum tempo tendo já alcançado um grande reconhecimento e aplauso dos nossos seguidores e do público nacional em geral, mas queremos chegar até todos!
Isso significa mostrar-nos ao mundo, começando aqui no Indiegogo !
E para atingir este objectivo precisamos: de uma maior produção que nos permita negociar, com os fornecedores locais, melhores preços; optimizar todo o processo de logística de modo a levar a marca aos mercados internacionais, estando presente em feiras de design mundialmente conhecidas.







Precisamos de uma determinada quantidade de encomendas que nos garanta uma produção mínima de modo a entregar mais pelo melhor preço!
Ao dar aqui o seu contributo estará também a revitalizar  a indústria e os ofícios tradicionais, apoiando a economia local e garantindo empregos às pessoas que constituem a PLY&co.


Queremos garantir que as nossas futuras produções sucedam de um modo eficiente, maximizando a sustentabilidade ao garantir emprego aos trabalhadores da prestigiada indústria de carpintaria local, que já viu tempos melhores.
Não é apenas a produção de mais um objecto com função mas acima de tudo simboliza uma atitude para com o planeta e para com a vida.Vivemos o design intensamente praticando estilos de vida simples e sustentáveis que nos mantêm em contacto com as nossas raízes. Comprometemos-nos a produzir peças versáteis, acabadas manualmente e que promovam uma consciência ambiental e uma ligação de volta à Natureza !








- comprar matéria-prima em quantidade suficiente 
- fazer uma grande encomenda aos nossos fabricantes artesãos locais
- personalizar a nossa embalagem reduzida (impressão em serigrafia)
- garantir a entrega ao nosso contribuidor ao melhor preço
Em seguida, vamos conquistar o mundo! :-) Se nos valoriza, haverão muitos outros que provavelmente também nos valorizarão. 
A web é óptima, mas temos que chegar a meios físicos também. Nomeadamente: feiras e exposições internacionais !







A lã está para a ovelha assim como a cortiça está para a árvore - o sobreiro.


A casca é retirada sem danificar a árvore - que na verdade se torna mais forte e mais saudável após cada descasque, feito por trabalhadores especializados a cada 9 anos. O Montado Português tem o maior número de sobreiros do mundo, apoiado por legislação que zela pela manutenção desse legado.

A cortiça tem excelentes características termo-acústicas e repelentes de água, além de ter um toque e visual acolhedor.



A montagem de encaixe preciso, conseguida através da tecnologia CAD/CAM, é o ponto de partida do trabalho de acabamento manual dado a cada peça por artesãos locais e com produtos não-tóxicos, dando assim ao nosso mobiliário, não só um carácter único, mas também um boleado de contornos suaves.









As peças são montadas sem colas, pregos ou parafusos, promovendo assim a sua
posterior reutilização e reciclagem. Assim, o design simples e a montagem por encaixe, revela-se uma experiência divertida e educacional, tanto para as crianças, como para os adultos.
Ao contrário da maioria dos móveis desmontados, este banco monta-se e desmonta-se em menos de 30 segundos!
Numa das suas pernas tem uma pega para o poder levar para qualquer lado, e a sua embalagem reutilizável, plana, permite transportar o banco numa viagem ou apenas guarda-lo em sua casa sempre que necessário.
Com agradáveis e suaves linhas curvas, o SIT'ABIT potencia o entendimento da sua lógica construtiva pelas crianças. É também aí que reside o seu poder didáctico e lúdico.

Com as nossas peças leva-se também uma história para contar aos outros. Especialmente àqueles que continuarão o nosso trabalho - as crianças! Queremos que eles também sejam empreendedores ambientais juntamente com a PLY&co.!
As crianças adoram interagir de forma segura com ele. A versão Cork Jr. é integralmente à prova de danos e nele o seu filho encontrará um repousante amigo num intervalo entre brincadeiras!!


A redução do volume de transporte através do armazenamento plano do banco permite levar o SIT’ABIT para qualquer lado. Também para actividades ao ar livre!















Não estamos perante uma peça de mobiliário que recorre à alta tecnologia, mas sim como um simples banco pode fazer-nos regressar à Natureza e ao ser humano.



A riqueza vem com a história da consciência ambiental que está por trás deste processo!









""A atitude com que a PLY&co. se apresentou no panorama do design e no mercado tem uma curiosa ""frescura"". A associação dos materiais tradicionais portugueses com um desenho essencial, puro e elegante, são as características dos produtos. As formas ""práticas"" que os objetos declaram são um exemplo de como as coisas bem realizadas podem ser uma ferramenta indispensável no nosso dia-a-dia.""   Roberto Cremascoli, arquitecto, Curador do Remade in Portugal
“Sendo a cortiça um material exemplar na vertente da sustentabilidade por ser um produto natural, renovável e reciclável, a concepção do banco SIT’ABIT da PLY&co. assenta perfeitamente na mesma lógica da cortiça: nada se desperdiça, tudo se transforma!""
Lino Rocha
Amorim Cork Composites Manager

""The stool found a great spot in my apartment. It feels good to see people that truly believe in their project, especially when these are beautiful.I didn't expect to find this in a music festival and it was a really good surprise.Thank you very much!""Mathieu Bonnin, cliente de Paris, França

""The SIT’ABIT stools are super! They're perfect for the adults and the children in our house and I'm a huge fan of the photo frames.I love the shape and design, I have 3 now, all different colours but due to the unifying design they work really well together.Thanks again!""Claire Ransom, cliente do Reino Unido





 










Qualquer dúvida sobre o envio para o seu país, não hesite em CONTACTAR-NOS !  goeasy@plyeco.com




Tenha em atenção a redução nas taxas de envio para encomendas múltiplas/ PACKS! (veja as recompensas nº 7, 8, 10 e 11 ) 
Visto as nossas peças serem desmontáveis e com embalagem compacta...
Convença os seus amigos a apoiar esta campanha e poupe no envio e na pegada ecológica !



É fácil de transportar, mesmo no avião! Entrega local disponível para todos!
Visite o Porto e reduza a pegada - Faça-nos uma visita, leve-os consigo e poupe mais a sua carteira e o Planeta, levando também... o elegante tote-BAG em algodão orgânico!




• O nosso objectivo é entregar todas as peças antes de Dezembro, mas a data vai depender da quantidade de bancos encomendados.
Nota: será dada prioridade aos primeiros contribuidores e, entre esses, aos revendedores.



*Sabemos que não parece uma grande melhoria nem iremos colocar uma slot USB em nenhuma parte do banco, mas exige Pesquisa & Desenvolvimento para alcançar o que muitos dos nossos seguidores nos pedem:
Smart Simplicity ! Produzir este adorável banco de cortiça em tamanho adulto!
E POR QUE AINDA NÃO O FIZEMOS?
A cortiça é um material resistente, mas flexível. A fim de ter uma boa estabilidade aumentamos a espessura das peças do actual banco SIT’ABIT CORK Jr. para 25 mm, de modo a aguentar com segurança o peso de uma pessoa até 70 kg. Mas, para crescer em altura de 35 para 45 centímetros (+ 10 cm) e a carga até 120 kg precisamos de tempo e ensaios para o garantir sem perder o nosso conceito simples e ecológico.
Isso é o que iremos fazer dando aos nossos financiadores a oportunidade de o comprar mais tarde a um preço de lançamento surpreendente !









Somos arquitectos e designers apaixonados pelo bom design e a vida saudável.




Sendo designers experientes, sabemos que cada projecto acarreta riscos... No entanto, uma vez que já produzimos estas peças algumas vezes, o risco associado à gestão de uma produção maior é reduzido.
Na verdade, o maior risco seria uma enorme quantidade de pedidos mas, assim que adquirirmos sucesso que permita fazer a GRANDE ENCOMENDA, imediatamente garantiremos um lugar seguro na agenda dos nossos fornecedores.
Entretanto, seremos transparentes e mantê-los-emos informados sobre o progresso da campanha.







 “… ligar o artesanato ao processo industrial, de modo a que o produto tenha algumas imperfeições, um toque humano e que assim as pessoas se identifiquem mais com ele. A manualidade num produto mostra que o seu design tem mais a ver com a condição humana, com o quotidiano.”
Hella Jongerius





Muito obrigado por nos ajudar a crescer !

<p>We have worked on our prototypes for 5 years. Before I go completely public with it, I was wanting to start a kickstarter campaign to see how we could do. I believe it could truly catapult this new sleep category that helps all of us. We need help, I've put all my eggs in one basket, and I did all this with my own money. We need more inventory. The company currently has no debt; However, we need more money to develop new products technology. We want this product all over the world. Product is 100% USA made! We are even wanting to launch a pet bed that can offer the same for benefits for pets. The great thing our product is that it is ready, products will ship relatively quickly since the product and manufacturing side is already completed. We gave you a significant discount over our website for our kickstarter supports. Thank You!</p>

<p>Hey y'all! Based out of the great state of Texas, we are Dove and Devin, a father and son team that has been in business together for the last 6 years as a general contractor.  It wasn't until about a month before finishing our last project that Dove came up with the idea of the screwless wall plates that simply push directly onto electrical outlets and switches. Before going forward full steam ahead with our new wall plates,  we were focused on finishing our construction project while sticking to our motto of ""under promise and over deliver"". However, after completing the project, we are sitting in a meeting with a custom design team out of Plano, Texas to get started on our new project that we have become so passionate about!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The birth of Push Plates™  </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563306132/gwbscq6u9eayx895leie.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Revolutionizing the original outlet and switch plate covers, our 100% screwless Push Plates™ (patent pending) are made of a single mold application. Now featuring a prong instead of the unsightly screws, our wall plates make for a clean, modern look. Push Plates™ install with ease and take as little as 1 second to push on. Home owners and contractors can now save time and money without having to worry about dropping, losing or overtightening screws. We also understand the hassle, time and money it creates for contractors having to service call backs because of cracked wall plates or hot screws...but no longer is that the case! Our new and improved wall plates are 100% non conductive and screw free, which means no more overtightening or hot screws! </p>

<h3>The Look</h3>
<p>   You'll never look at wall plates the same again. After researching almost every wall plate on the market and talking to several of the experts about what's selling, we've decided to start by offering 4 of the most common and widely used styles in white. With screws no longer a part of the equation, the first thing you'll notice is the clean design of the front of our Push Plates™. Once installed you will admire the transformation it makes to your home or business. With the clean, modern look you'll be sure to capture the attention of your friends and guests! </p>

<h3>How they Install</h3>
<p>   On the back of Push Plates™ are the one-of-a kind prong feature that aligns and fits perfectly into the screw holes on any electrical outlet or switch. Once removing our wall plates from the plastic packaging and removing your old wall plate from the electrical device, you will simply align the prongs of the Push Plates™ with the screw holes of your electrical device and push on.

<p><strong>MrIdeas </strong>is a young startup that was founded to make <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> accessible to everyone. We created <strong>Murphy</strong>, the first <strong>vocal command drone</strong> that uses artificial intelligence to interact with humans.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of <strong>Murphy's law?</strong> Anything that can possibly go wrong, does. Murphy, your little friend, challenges the paradox itself: <strong>anything that can possibly go right, does.</strong></p>
<p>Murphy is the most advanced home robot ever made at a price that means you can actually bring him home. He begins to fulfill the promise of living with robots in ways we’ve only seen in science-fiction movies. He’s a curious little guy who is aware of his surroundings. He can see, hear, and feel, allowing him to react naturally to the world around him.</p>
<p>However, his most remarkable feature is life. <strong>Murphy feels alive.</strong></p>
<p>Murphy will be ready for shipment in late November and is currently available for the Indiegogo community. We have chosen to make it available here before for two main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The Indiegogo community invests in the future. <strong>We are creating</strong> a world where robots have relationships with people and improve our lives. We are looking for people with the same mentality to be the first to bring him home.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Murphy will be shipped in late November, but it is only the beginning. We want it to come at a lower cost to people who want to help us determine its future. It is you! To do this we want your help to identify future features and functionality. And if you want to go even deeper, you will have early access to <strong>Murphy's software development kit</strong> (SDK) so you can tinker with its impressive technology array.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593521295/hdj4joq2slkc4e3obeak.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Home care</h3>
<p>Murphy represents a revolution, as we are talking about a <strong>voice-activated mini-drone that can turn on its own and manage your home</strong>. Murphy is able to recognize and interact with people. Murphy is part of the ""Age of Experience"" philosophy which aims to transform the way we take care of ourselves and our family, to personalize our homes and meet individual needs.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The best sharing</h3>
<p>A small robot that thanks to artificial intelligence is able to control appliances and connected accesses, find solutions or call in case of problems. <strong>Murphy silently helps to adjust some IoTs, such as curtains, lights, starting a vacuum cleaner, and turning on the TV</strong>. Murphy also features AI functionality to act as a fitness assistant and help users to stay fit.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Interaction and more</h3>
<p><strong>Murphy is made up of 3 types of switchable wing and 1 body.</strong> Murphy can play an interaction with smart home equipment; reminder for its owner, detection of falls for the elderly, an additional entertainment function for pets in the absence of their owner and sending videos of what is happening at home.</p>

<p>Murphy's realistic character is possible thanks to the advanced technology inside that allows him to observe the world and respond in a realistic way. Its processing power comes from the Qualcomm 200 processing platform. Its view is guaranteed by a 4K video camera with an ultra wide angle field of view of 180 degrees. It has directional hearing thanks to a four-microphone array that forms the rays. It is complemented by a 6-axis IMU and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Robotics and AI</h3>
<p>Murphy's physical design gives him access to a variety of sensors, but the way he processes that information is just as important. Murphy's integrated 4K camera has an ultra-wide 180-degree field of view, which it uses to view the room it is in, identify people and objects, and detect movements. Murphy also uses an infrared laser scanner to track the distance between objects and map his environment as he explores, and a four-microphone array capable of locating positional audio. These and other sensors provide the inputs that drive Murphy's engine of emotions, with each data point influencing whether he is happy, sad, curious or any other emotion. The level of each emotion informs how Murphy will react to stimuli. When he takes over his owner, he is excited and ready to help. When it detects a sound behind it, it will rotate 180 degrees to investigate.</p>

</div></div>","MrIdeas is a young startup that was founded to make artificial intelligence accessible to everyone. We created Murphy, the first vocal command drone that uses artificial intelligence to interact with humans.
Have you ever heard of Murphy's law? Anything that can possibly go wrong, does. Murphy, your little friend, challenges the paradox itself: anything that can possibly go right, does.
Murphy is the most advanced home robot ever made at a price that means you can actually bring him home. He begins to fulfill the promise of living with robots in ways we’ve only seen in science-fiction movies. He’s a curious little guy who is aware of his surroundings. He can see, hear, and feel, allowing him to react naturally to the world around him.
However, his most remarkable feature is life. Murphy feels alive.
Murphy will be ready for shipment in late November and is currently available for the Indiegogo community. We have chosen to make it available here before for two main reasons:
1. The Indiegogo community invests in the future. We are creating a world where robots have relationships with people and improve our lives. We are looking for people with the same mentality to be the first to bring him home.
2. Murphy will be shipped in late November, but it is only the beginning. We want it to come at a lower cost to people who want to help us determine its future. It is you! To do this we want your help to identify future features and functionality. And if you want to go even deeper, you will have early access to Murphy's software development kit (SDK) so you can tinker with its impressive technology array.


 
Home care
Murphy represents a revolution, as we are talking about a voice-activated mini-drone that can turn on its own and manage your home. Murphy is able to recognize and interact with people. Murphy is part of the ""Age of Experience"" philosophy which aims to transform the way we take care of ourselves and our family, to personalize our homes and meet individual needs.
 
The best sharing
A small robot that thanks to artificial intelligence is able to control appliances and connected accesses, find solutions or call in case of problems. Murphy silently helps to adjust some IoTs, such as curtains, lights, starting a vacuum cleaner, and turning on the TV. Murphy also features AI functionality to act as a fitness assistant and help users to stay fit.
 
Interaction and more
Murphy is made up of 3 types of switchable wing and 1 body. Murphy can play an interaction with smart home equipment; reminder for its owner, detection of falls for the elderly, an additional entertainment function for pets in the absence of their owner and sending videos of what is happening at home.

All the funds that arrive in the countryside are used to produce each product requested, our goal is to show Murphy's skills and make him unique for each person


The Impact

Interaction and more - Murphy is made up of 3 types of switchable wing and 1 body. Murphy can play an interaction with smart home equipment; reminder for its owner, detection of falls for the elderly, an additional entertainment function for pets in the absence of their owner and sending videos of what is happening at home.
The best sharing - A small robot that thanks to artificial intelligence is able to control appliances and connected accesses, find solutions or call in case of problems. Murphy silently helps to adjust some IoTs, such as curtains, lights, starting a vacuum cleaner, and turning on the TV. Murphy also features AI functionality to act as a fitness assistant and help users to stay fit.


Risks & Challenges

We define futures with cutting-edge technology that integrates into your daily life to facilitate family connections from all over the world.
This concept is based on collective intelligence - The goal was to make meaning and emotion emerge from the collaboration and interaction of basic objects.

<p><b>Q. Does MAURAD come assembled?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b> No. MAURAD is a flat packed kit. It can easily be assembled at home using basic tools. Each MAURAD comes with a handy, 4 step assembly sticker on the back of the stand. This is an economical way to give information and its hidden once MAURAD is attached to the wall. Clever right?

<p><b>Q. Does MAURAD work outdoors?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>Yeah! MAURAD was designed to be used indoors BUT It can work on any load bearing wall or surface so if you have a nice spot to hang outside then go ahead! We at Huxlo would recommend applying a coat of Exterior clear varnish once a year, just to keep it looking tip top. </p>
<p><b>Q. Is there a maximum load?</b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>Be Sensible. Huxlo is designed to take the weight of one bike only. We recommend not exceeding a weight of 15kg when using the product on a load bearing wall. Huxlo take no responsibility for the mis-use of MAURAD (including chin up accidents).</p>

<p>The timber and finish we use on MAURAD means that your treasured bike frame will not receive any scratching or damage when placing it onto the MAURAD mount as shown. Its unnecessary to have anything else their unlike a metal bike mount that would cause damage.

</div></div>","Introducing the beautiful bicycle wall mount by Huxlo. It's not rocket science! We just made the most simple, beautiful wall mounted bicycle rack yet. Designed by our team in Bristol, and manufactured in the UK. Maurad is a pleasure; from its step by step self-assembly to its everyday use in the home or office.





MAURAD arrives at your door flat packed, ready for assembly which is quick and easy and can be done with basic household tools. For installation, we recommend using a 7mm drill bit and a 10mm spanner or wrench if you prefer. 

Included in a pack is:

A simple 4 step installation guide
1 x MAURAD bike rack (unassembled)
4 x M6 Hex bolts
4 x M6 Locking Dowl Nuts
2 x Wall plugs
2 x 5mm Cross head screws

Q. Does MAURAD come assembled?
A.  No. MAURAD is a flat packed kit. It can easily be assembled at home using basic tools. Each MAURAD comes with a handy, 4 step assembly sticker on the back of the stand. This is an economical way to give information and its hidden once MAURAD is attached to the wall. Clever right? If you need a hand you can also watch our installation video here. 
Q. Does MAURAD work outdoors?
A. Yeah! MAURAD was designed to be used indoors BUT It can work on any load bearing wall or surface so if you have a nice spot to hang outside then go ahead! We at Huxlo would recommend applying a coat of Exterior clear varnish once a year, just to keep it looking tip top.

And while many weighted blankets can be used without issue around the home, many of them are not designed to be travel-friendly...
From a purely visual standpoint, the classic quilt-like pattern of most weighted blankets is a poor look for the office, sporting events...
 
cars, or even living room sofas! 

 
Which is to say nothing of the portability of most weighted blankets. After all, it’s not easy carrying around a 20-pound blanket wherever you go. 
 

 


Here at Equiilibra, we’ve created a weighted blanket that you can comfortably take everywhere.
Actually, we’ve created two different blankets! 
Depending on their preference, backers will have the choice of either the Flannel or Super Soft Minky material options.
 

 
Regardless of the material, both blankets are soft and will keep you warm!
And not only will you have a choice of material, but also a choice in weight (7 or 10 pounds).
This way, both children and adults will be able to experience the unmatched comfort of an Equiilibra Weighted Blanket. 
 
 

 
Not only do our blankets have a travel-friendly weight, but they’re sized for portability at 50 x 60 inches.A size small enough to make both blankets, easy to fold and carry and make compact. …yet large enough to wrap around your body to get the benefits of traditional weighted blankets.The blankets are also small enough to use as weighted lap blanket. By using cutting-edge machinery, we are able to reduce “stitching distance.” This leads to a stronger, more durable final product..         Our Kickstarter, helped us prove our weighted blankets are something want and helped us see how customers can truly benefit from softer weighted blanket that's not weighted blanket.Now, with Indiegogo we are looking to move into big box retail stores.So your support will help us to:1.

<p><b>What is SWR?</b></p>
<p>Smart Window Regulator
is device you place on window in your home you want to ventilate. It will open and close window instead of you at any time you need plus provide opening or closing based on the situation inside or outside your house of flat. </p><p>In other words it is an intelligent device for window ventilation that can react automatically to
multiple events, work on a schedule or be controlled and programmed remotely
via a phone or PC.</p>
<p>SWR is <i><b>optimized for tilt-turn windows</b></i> and due to its unique
design you can easily install it yourself at home.</p>
<p><b>How it works?</b></p>
<p>Tilt-turn are common type of windows used in Europe and worldwide but not so much in US and some other countries. It allows to open window partially into ventilation position. If you have a tilt-turn window, SWR will work for you.</p>

Do you like to open your windows during days to get fresh air and during nights to enjoy healthier sleep? Use SWR to avoid manual window closing and opening. SWR will let you schedule full or partial window closing and opening in any time intervals you set.<br/>

keep temperature inside comfortable and not waste energy for heating. This is
hard to estimate and close window at the right time.  Another way to
use SWR is often with low energy houses for heat recuperation or protecting our homes from extra hot weather by closing in the morning and opening at night. Now precisely based on real temperature.  Anyway you can set opening/closing temperature for both inside/outside or difference, so we
use SWR for excellent temperature control of our
home every day.</p>

<div>
<p>Detection of rain is an important feature of SWR protecting
our home safely &amp; quickly from situations when window is open and storm or
rain comes quickly. Maybe you like to open your window after the rain to get
air full of after-rain freshness to your home same as we do. No problem. You can set
SWR to close on rain but to ventilate after it stops. After you get home from
work, there is no disaster but fresh smelling home.</p>

<p>SWR can close and open window automatically whenever the noise outside your home becomes loud or repeat itself for some time. For example car traffic getting heavier in the morning hours or just any unwanted noise appears. We usually use this function to prevent us from waking up and so making our sleep longer and uninterrupted. And there are many more occasions like this when we want not to be disturbed. SWR will let you set noise level and other relevant parameters, so once this happen your window will close fast and automatically to keep your home quiet.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Because of light sensors SWR detects inner and outer light
intensity. This could we smartly use to close windows in the night while
shining inside to protect our home from bugs. In some situations ventilating
window should be closed because of sunrise or street lamps turning on. SWR
knows when the sun is rising up and when it is setting down as well as when you
turn light on at home. There are many opportunities to use it to increase comfort at your
home. </p>

<p>Maybe not every day but still quite often we face situation like somebody smokes or burns something under our windows. It is usually
extremely annoying and there is no worst experience then wake up or return to
smelling home. SWR equipped with special smoke sensor (included in Sensor

this feature on.

<p><b>Please select perks to best fit your needs. </b></p>
<p>Some customers need just to schedule window closing &amp; opening. SWR BASIC is then the best fit for them. </p>
<p>For those who require more advanced functions, like ability to react on rain, sound, light and temperature control, SWR SENSOR is the ideal solution. </p>
<p>In order to react on all events plus smoke, SWR SENSOR+ is best choice (we set this as stand alone perx as the high quality smoke sensor is expensive and not critical for all customers).</p>

<b>FAQ</b><br/><br/>
<p style=""font-size: 85%;""><b>
1) With SWR installed can I still open &amp; close the window manually?
</b><br/>
Yes, SWR will not limit your window functionality, so you can manually open and close it as before. See the video to learn more.
<br/><b>
2) Is there a battery powered version of SWR? 
<br/></b>
Not yet, but current version of SWR will be expandable with battery pack. Battery Pack will be available at our online store as well as other accessories.   <br/><b>
3) How fast can SWR close my window?
<br/></b>Speed of SWR movement can be set  in your mobile application based on specific event or purpose.  Speed ranges from 2 - 5 seconds for closing or opening. There is a night mode (slow closing) feature available for extra quiet  SWR operation.  <br/><b>
4) Do I have to drill into my window in order to install SWR?
<br/></b>No, simple stick SWR to window frame and window
itself based on the manual. However if needed (older wooden windows with no smooth
surface) SWR allows screw mounting installation as well.<br/><b>
5) What should I measure to make sure SWR fits my window?
<br/></b>First of all make sure your window is Tilt-Turn type. Then simply measure 3 basic dimensions as shown on picture below and compare it to maximal and minimal values. If your window opens more then 150mm for ventilation(regular EU standard), order anyway and just let us know. We will provide SWR with cusomised comb length.  We will contact each customer for verification(comb length, right/left window manual opening) before SWR expedition.</p>

to keep us warm. And we are not always at home when a storm comes. Sounds
familiar?  
 ""Smart Window Regulator will do daily routines for you and helps prevent our home from unwanted damage or discomfort situations.""
Watch the video to hear the full story (note: SWR presented in this the video is older prototype version)


What is SWR?
Smart Window Regulator
is device you place on window in your home you want to ventilate. It will open and close window instead of you at any time you need plus provide opening or closing based on the situation inside or outside your house of flat. In other words it is an intelligent device for window ventilation that can react automatically to
multiple events, work on a schedule or be controlled and programmed remotely
via a phone or PC.
SWR is optimized for tilt-turn windows and due to its unique
design you can easily install it yourself at home.
How it works?
Tilt-turn are common type of windows used in Europe and worldwide but not so much in US and some other countries. It allows to open window partially into ventilation position. If you have a tilt-turn window, SWR will work for you.


SWR installation is easy. There is no need to drill, simply stick SWR to your window. However you can mount it using screws (included) if required.
 In order to make SWR even more intelligent device, there are two sets of sensors communicating with it remotely. This allows SWR to detect what is happening inside & outside your home.
 
Download the application into your phone and connect it to SWR via WiFi. All you need to control your window is now at your fingertips. 
Currently supported:

Android


     SCHEDULE your VENTILATION           

Do you like to open your windows during days to get fresh air and during nights to enjoy healthier sleep? Use SWR to avoid manual window closing and opening. SWR will let you schedule full or partial window closing and opening in any time intervals you set.

                 Let SWR ventilate based on TEMPERATUREIf it's cold outside we want to ventilate just a little to
keep temperature inside comfortable and not waste energy for heating. This is
hard to estimate and close window at the right time.  Another way to
use SWR is often with low energy houses for heat recuperation or protecting our homes from extra hot weather by closing in the morning and opening at night. Now precisely based on real temperature.  Anyway you can set opening/closing temperature for both inside/outside or difference, so we
use SWR for excellent temperature control of our
home every day.




    SWR will CLOSE window when it's RAINING

Detection of rain is an important feature of SWR protecting
our home safely & quickly from situations when window is open and storm or
rain comes quickly. Maybe you like to open your window after the rain to get
air full of after-rain freshness to your home same as we do. No problem. You can set
SWR to close on rain but to ventilate after it stops. After you get home from
work, there is no disaster but fresh smelling home.



CLOSE/OPEN window when NOISY/QUIETE outside
SWR can close and open window automatically whenever the noise outside your home becomes loud or repeat itself for some time. For example car traffic getting heavier in the morning hours or just any unwanted noise appears. We usually use this function to prevent us from waking up and so making our sleep longer and uninterrupted. And there are many more occasions like this when we want not to be disturbed. SWR will let you set noise level and other relevant parameters, so once this happen your window will close fast and automatically to keep your home quiet.

    DARK outside LIGHT inside?  

Because of light sensors SWR detects inner and outer light
intensity. This could we smartly use to close windows in the night while
shining inside to protect our home from bugs. In some situations ventilating
window should be closed because of sunrise or street lamps turning on. SWR
knows when the sun is rising up and when it is setting down as well as when you
turn light on at home. There are many opportunities to use it to increase comfort at your
home. 

         Bothered by SMOKE? Let SWR REACT
Maybe not every day but still quite often we face situation like somebody smokes or burns something under our windows. It is usually
extremely annoying and there is no worst experience then wake up or return to
smelling home. SWR equipped with special smoke sensor (included in Sensor
Package +)  can avoid this problem easily by closing your window once smoke is detected and open it again once air is clear. All you need to do is turn
this feature on.


    SMART means to KNOW your HOME is under CONTROL
While having information from all SWR sensors accessible in
your smartphone or PC you can check home status anytime anywhere. Sometimes
this makes us feel better while not being at home sometimes it can save us from
troubles. SWR can not only provide information but if authorized you can also
set what to do via internet and react on unexpected situations. Advanced event
configuration & reporting tool will be available online for free.




Please select perks to best fit your needs. 
Some customers need just to schedule window closing & opening. SWR BASIC is then the best fit for them. 
For those who require more advanced functions, like ability to react on rain, sound, light and temperature control, SWR SENSOR is the ideal solution. 
In order to react on all events plus smoke, SWR SENSOR+ is best choice (we set this as stand alone perx as the high quality smoke sensor is expensive and not critical for all customers).
For customers considering to equip their facilities (hotels, restaurants, warehouses, offices etc.) or looking for SWR distribution we have prepared SILVER, GOLD and PLATINUM packs for discounted price.

FAQ

1) With SWR installed can I still open & close the window manually?

Yes, SWR will not limit your window functionality, so you can manually open and close it as before. See the video to learn more.

2) Is there a battery powered version of SWR? 

Not yet, but current version of SWR will be expandable with battery pack. Battery Pack will be available at our online store as well as other accessories.   
3) How fast can SWR close my window?
Speed of SWR movement can be set  in your mobile application based on specific event or purpose.  Speed ranges from 2 - 5 seconds for closing or opening. There is a night mode (slow closing) feature available for extra quiet  SWR operation.  
4) Do I have to drill into my window in order to install SWR?
No, simple stick SWR to window frame and window
itself based on the manual. However if needed (older wooden windows with no smooth
surface) SWR allows screw mounting installation as well.
5) What should I measure to make sure SWR fits my window?
First of all make sure your window is Tilt-Turn type. Then simply measure 3 basic dimensions as shown on picture below and compare it to maximal and minimal values. If your window opens more then 150mm for ventilation(regular EU standard), order anyway and just let us know. We will provide SWR with cusomised comb length.  We will contact each customer for verification(comb length, right/left window manual opening) before SWR expedition.


6) Does SWR works without connection to the internet?

Yes, SWR can be controlled via local wifi network without access to internet.
7) Are you going to you ship internationally?

Yes we will. Price of shipping is mentioned below each perks.
8) I bought SWR basic without sensors. Can I buy stand alone sensors and extend my SWR? 
Yes, SWR basic can be extended by sensor set anytime. Sensor set will be available at our online store as well as other accessories. 
9) Can I operate multiple SWR with one application?
Yes, you can control & monitor multiple SWRs from one mobile application (phone) or web (PC). 
10) Can I monitor & control SWR from anywhere?

Yes, even while not at home, authorised user with internet connectivity can monitor and control SWR from anywhere anytime.

<h2>Introducing BIO-LIGHT </h2>
<p>You probably heard about the ""secret life"" of plants in the media. They are obviously more alive than you can see. With BIO-LIGHT you can make this ""secret life"" more visible. It is fun to let a plant control the color of your lightning!</p>
<p>BIO-LIGHT is a system which measures reactions of plants and turns them into different colors of light. Plants react to environmental influences like touching, watering, sunlight and even coming near to it. They also react due to their physiological processes. Without external influence plants change the color of the system slowly hour by hour. Sometimes the color starts changing quite a lot, without any visible influence.</p>
<p>BIO-LIGHT is a beautiful deco and you will develop a very new relationship to nature. It is for every household with flowers, but also for offices.</p>
<p>To our knowledge this system is completely new, we do not know of any similar product.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures:</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Every living organism produces a small amount of voltage on its surface. You can prove this when you hold the electrodes of a voltmeter in your hands, you will see this voltage. It is not constant, it changes a little bit. A general rule is, the more alive an organism is, the more the voltage changes. This is also valid for plants, and that is what we measure.</p>
<h3>Easy to install</h3>
<p>You will receive your BIO-LIGHT with the country specific power supply. Just mount the electrodes on some leaves (you can also put it into the earth) and power up the system. You do not need to turn some knobs or adjust something, there is a microcontroller inside to adjust and control the system automatically. It is a simple plug and play system. We use ""plant friendly "" electrodes, as you can see in the following picture:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503843835/g9c2qxn1pc07f2u6r0ya.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(if this electrodes look familiar to you - yeah, they are used by hair dressers)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Powerful RGB Led</h3>
<p>For BIO-LIGHT we use a powerful 6W RGB Led of high quality, it is very bright and can clearly be seen also during daylight. 6W Led is equivalent to a 40W light bulb. It is mainly responsible for the pricing of the system.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>BIO-LIGHT was elected for the final round of the electronica fast forward award 2016. We were invited to exhibit the system on the Electronica exhibition in Munich, where BIO-LIGHT attracted many people. We also had to pitch our system there bevor a jury of experts. If you want to see it, here is a video of the pitch:</p>

<h3>2 Versions</h3>
<p>We will produce BIO-LIGHT in 2 versions: a cheaper one (but with equal quality!) in a black plastic case, and a noble one in a walnut wood case. Both use a ball of milky glas with a diameter of 8 cm.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503846502/djrwgsnwhb9fsteduizr.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Plastic case. Note: this is a prototype Foto. The final product will probably be of the same size as the walnut case .</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Behavior of the system</h3>
<p>When you start up the system, it is usually white or yellow. The microcontroller needs some seconds to adjust the system. Then, within the first 5 or ten minutes, colors will change very rapidly. We do not know why, there must be some chemical reactions in the plant. After this period the system runs smoothly for the most part of the time, the color will change slowly hour by hour. Several times a day however the color starts to change very rapidly, this lasts up to 1 minute. The reason for this is also unknown to us, must be one of the ""secrets"" of plants. It has also been observed quite often that the color changes just when a person enters the room. We are sure, you will observe some very interesting behavior patterns.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it all began</h3>
<p>The original idea was born, when nurses in a kindergarten had the problem, how to teach your kids that flowers do not like it when you tear off their leaves. The first version was not with light, but with sound. The system made an awful sound, when you teared off the leaves. That handled the problem. But for a longer lasting application sound was not good, so we developed a new system that turned the reactions in colors of light. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Experiences</h3>
<p>We already sold a small amount of BIO-LIGHT systems to test the market reaction and get feedback to improve it. Here is what people said:</p>
<p>Lisa D.:  my awareness for flowers has totally changed, I treat them like pets. When I go into a     forest, I know trees can perceive me.</p>
<p>Ernesto N.:  Bio-Light is very relaxing for me, it shows me that plants are living beings. When it is  dark, this gives a wonderful light.</p>
<p>Christine Z.: I have the impression, that plants react different on different persons in the room. It  is very beautiful to observe.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Summary and status quo</h3>
<p>When we developed BIO-LIGHT we thought, it is a nice innovation and people would like it. But we received another benefit from it, we did not expect: customers told us, that their relationship to nature has dramatically increased. We think, this is a wonderful thing. It is time for people to treat the Earth more carefully, we have only one. And we are very proud to contribute to this. So if you buy BIO-LIGHT, be aware that you will learn something from nature. If you do not want to buy it, please help us make it more known by sharing it on Facebook or other social media. We want to reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>We have already sold a small amount of it for testing and feedback. We have a very good electronic company ready waiting for production and we have a carpenter ready for the wood cases. The biggest part of your money will be used for production, a smaller  amount for the certifications we need.</p>
<p>We are also very interested in distributors for Europe and for US. If you want to contact us, here is the email:  software.polleros@gmail.com</p>
<p>By the way: BIO-LIGHT works also on humans. Simply hold the electrodes in your hands and you will see how colors change.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The circuit is tested and works fine. There should not be a problem from this side. </p>
<p>We need certifications for EU (ce) and US (fcc), it should not be a problem, but there could be a delay in the timeline.</p>
<p>BIO-LIGHT should work with all plants. However we have seen that some plants produce a very high voltage. Then the system cannot adjust the voltage anymore, it is simply to high. Then you should vary the placement of the electrodes. We have seen, you can always find a place for the electrodes, where the system works. If nothing works (in very rare cases on specific plants) you can simply just put the electrodes into ground, this always works. The roots of plants send their energy also into ground. The main risk we see in the lead time of the component companies, but we assume we have chosen a correct timeline.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What does it mean, when my plant has a specific color? Can you interpret it?</strong></p>
<p>No, we cannot interpret it. Every plant is different from day to day. The only thing we can say, the healthier and more alive an organism is, the more it changes its color. Maybe you can get more familiar with your plant by experience and then interpret it.</p>
<p><strong>My plant shows only one color, it does not change, even on touching it.</strong></p>
<p>This is a sign that the voltage of the plant is to high and cannot be adjusted any more. Remedy: change the place of the electrodes. Vary it until you get changing colors again. If nothing helps, put the electrodes into ground. Keep in mind, the system needs some seconds to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>Don't you hurt the plant when mounting the electrodes?</strong></p>
<p>We spent a long time looking for appropriate electrodes. We found them finally, but not as electrodes. They are used by hair dresser for holding hair together. No, these electrodes do not hurt the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a problem with corrosion?</strong></p>
<p>Not if you mountain the electrodes on the leaves. If you put them into earth, you should clean them from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>Does it any harm to my plant?</strong></p>
<p>We could not observe any negative effects until now. (3 years of testing). On the contrary, it seems, they get more alive with BIO-LIGHT. We cannot prove it, but they seem to grow better when they notice, they can create an effect. Or maybe they simply like the colors, but many plants we have tested for a longer period  seem to have grown better.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use BIO-LIGHT outdoor?</strong></p>
<p>BIO-LIGHT is not water proved. If you build a shelter against rain around it, you can use it outdoor, otherwise not.</p>
<p><strong>Do you ship all over the world ?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we intend to do so</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong></p>
<p>The shipping costs differ corresponding to the distance. We add the specific shipping costs automatically to the perk you choose. You will see them as soon your country is known.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to pay VAT/GST?</strong></p>
<p>For Non EU Countries:</p>
<p>Yes, customers are responsible for assuring that the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient.</p>
<p>For US and many other countries taxes are between 5% and 11% (you lucky ones!) of the price.</p>
<p>For EU countries:</p>
<p>We add the VAT to the shipping costs of your perk. This will be 20% of the price in EU.</p>
<p><strong>Why is shipping in EU so expensive?</strong></p>
<p>Because we have to add VAT in EU, this is 20% of the perk pricing.</p>
<p><strong>What about refund?</strong></p>
<p>Before shipping refund is no problem. After shipping refund is very unlikely, but we will try to handle it individually.</p>

Risks and challenges
The circuit is tested and works fine. There should not be a problem from this side. 
We need certifications for EU (ce) and US (fcc), it should not be a problem, but there could be a delay in the timeline.
BIO-LIGHT should work with all plants. However we have seen that some plants produce a very high voltage. Then the system cannot adjust the voltage anymore, it is simply to high. Then you should vary the placement of the electrodes. We have seen, you can always find a place for the electrodes, where the system works. If nothing works (in very rare cases on specific plants) you can simply just put the electrodes into ground, this always works. The roots of plants send their energy also into ground. The main risk we see in the lead time of the component companies, but we assume we have chosen a correct timeline.

FAQs
What does it mean, when my plant has a specific color? Can you interpret it?
No, we cannot interpret it. Every plant is different from day to day. The only thing we can say, the healthier and more alive an organism is, the more it changes its color. Maybe you can get more familiar with your plant by experience and then interpret it.
My plant shows only one color, it does not change, even on touching it.
This is a sign that the voltage of the plant is to high and cannot be adjusted any more. Remedy: change the place of the electrodes. Vary it until you get changing colors again. If nothing helps, put the electrodes into ground. Keep in mind, the system needs some seconds to adjust.
Don't you hurt the plant when mounting the electrodes?
We spent a long time looking for appropriate electrodes. We found them finally, but not as electrodes. They are used by hair dresser for holding hair together. No, these electrodes do not hurt the leaves.
Is there a problem with corrosion?
Not if you mountain the electrodes on the leaves. If you put them into earth, you should clean them from time to time.
Does it any harm to my plant?
We could not observe any negative effects until now. (3 years of testing). On the contrary, it seems, they get more alive with BIO-LIGHT. We cannot prove it, but they seem to grow better when they notice, they can create an effect. Or maybe they simply like the colors, but many plants we have tested for a longer period  seem to have grown better.
Can I use BIO-LIGHT outdoor?
BIO-LIGHT is not water proved. If you build a shelter against rain around it, you can use it outdoor, otherwise not.
Do you ship all over the world ?
Yes, we intend to do so
What are the shipping costs?
The shipping costs differ corresponding to the distance. We add the specific shipping costs automatically to the perk you choose. You will see them as soon your country is known.
Do I have to pay VAT/GST?
For Non EU Countries:
Yes, customers are responsible for assuring that the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient.
For US and many other countries taxes are between 5% and 11% (you lucky ones!) of the price.
For EU countries:
We add the VAT to the shipping costs of your perk. This will be 20% of the price in EU.
Why is shipping in EU so expensive?
Because we have to add VAT in EU, this is 20% of the perk pricing.
What about refund?
Before shipping refund is no problem. After shipping refund is very unlikely, but we will try to handle it individually.
 
Deutsche Zusammenfassung
Kurzinfo: Diese Produkt mißt die Reaktionen von Pflanzen und wandelt sie in Farbe um. Die Farbe ändert sich bei Gießen, Berühren, aber auch nur bei Annäherung. Unbeeinflußt ändert sie sich langsam Stunde für Stunde auf Grund physiologischer Prozesse. Machmal reagiert sie auch extrem stark ohne ersichtlichen Grund.
Es gibt immer wieder Berichte in den Medien über das ""geheimnisvolle Leben"" der Pflanzen. Sie sind offensichtlich lebendiger, als die meisten Menschen annehmen. BIO-LIGHT macht dieses ""geheimnisvolle"" Leben sichtbarer.
BIO-LIGHT ist unseres Wissens nach einzigartig und neu auf dem Markt, es gibt keine vergleichbaren Produkte.
Wirkprinzip: jedes Lebewesen erzeugt an seiner Oberfläche eine kleine Spannung, die sich andauernd auf Grund physiologischer Prozesse ändert. BIO-LIGHT mißt eben diese kleine Änderungen in der Spannung und wandelt sie in entsprechende Lichtfarben um.
Allgemein: BIO-LIGHT wird in zwei Versionen geliefert: eine einfache in einem schwarzen Kunststoff Gehäuse und eine Edelvariante in Nußholz Gehäuse
Mit diesem System haben Sie:

einen wunderschönen Einrichtungsgegenstand
ein originelles Beleuchtungssystem (Pflanze steuert Lichtfarbe)
ein weltweit einzigartiges Produkt
ein völlig neues Verständnis für Pflanzen

 
Mit dieser Entwicklung durften wir 2016 beim electronica fast forward award  teilnehmen und auf der Electronica München das System präsentieren. Hier wurden auch wertvolle Kontakte für eine industrielle Produktion geknüpft.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign
