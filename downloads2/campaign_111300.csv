<h3>Baring Epitaph: Story from a Pacific Crest Trail</h3>
<p><i>If you want an offer which is not listed in perk section send me an e-mail and we can make arrangements</i></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Nikola Horvat - Tesla (38), theologian, father of 6 year old boy, divorced, freelance writer and an adventurer. In year 2016 I have successfully finished great journey on Pacific Crest Trail. </p>
<p>My fund goal is to publish a book. Experience from my journey is vast and turbulent. It was adventure of a lifetime and I think it is unique and inspiring. Besides my personal story there are lots of useful and interesting information about Pacific Crest Trail, people and places somehow connected to this beautiful trail. </p>
<p>In order to see the tip of an iceberg I invite you to watch documentary about my Pacific Crest Trail adventure. </p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>
<p>So, if you decide to fund my book you will contribute to one man's dream that outstrips his personal borders. From poor kid that lived in war environment of 90's, through being a Franciscan in search for God, he became the first Croat that finished 2659 miles of Pacific Crest Trail, but in the process he went thru divorce which led to breakdown so hiking the trail turned out to be a hell of a journey.</p>

<ul>
<li>Where the money goes: - Printing in Croatian language - 4000$</li>
<li>                                                - Translation -                                     1600$</li>

<li>                                                - All together -                                     7040$</li>
<li> </li>
<li>So, there are 3 perks for English speakers. Plain E-Book, E-Book and T-shirt, and E-Book, T-shirt and unique photo with credits in the book. So, pick up the one you like the most!!! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are lots of books with similar topics. But, every adventure is somewhat unique. Mine is inspiring and it was like a roller coaster of emotions. I am not hiding one bit of a story. My suffering is integral part of my journey and I felt I needed to write about it too. But, there was much more than suffering and pain. Positive message is what inspires. Good people and extraordinary hikers that treated me with respect are part of my victory as well. </p>
<p>Let me get this straight! I don't want to get rich with this book. I just want my story to reach and inspire more people. That is my general goal - to inspire! Every penny I earn is going to be for my next adventure on Continental Divide Trail that I plan to hike in 2018. So next documentary and book are already in plan....as a matter of fact my next book has already over 20 pages :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In this campaign only E-Book will be available in English language. To be frank, I don't know how vast interest for my book in the world will be. So, for now I will pay for translation of the book, but due to the cost of printing and shipping of the book I will print it later on if enough people show interest</p>
<p>Of course, translation of a book is major work so everybody who buys it will wait for her/his E-Book a little bit more then Croatian readers. I hope that fact will not discourage you to buy it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you don't have funds to help me to publish a book, and others already purchased a book but they want to go step further. No problem. You can share my story so it reaches more people and sponsors. The more people I reach, better the possibility to print an English version. So, please help me spread the word. Thank you for that!</p>

<h3>Barinški epitaf: priča s Pacific Crest Traila</h3>
<p><i>Ako među perkovima nema kombinacije koju biste željeli pošaljite mi mail pa ćemo složiti perk prema Vašim željama :)</i></p>
<p>Bok, moje ime je Nikola Horvat – Tesla (38), magistar sam teologije, otac šestogodišnjaka, razveden, slobodni pisac i avanturist. Godine 2016. sam uspješno završio pješačko putovanje na Pacific Crest Trailu.</p>
<p>Moj cilj je izdati knjigu. Iskustvo koje sam doživio na putovanju je široko i turbulentno. Bijaše to iskustvo života, i dakako – jedinstveno, te inspirirajuće. Uz spomenutu osobnu priču u knjizi se mogu naći razne korisne informacije o Pacific Crest Trailu, ali i ljudima i mjestima koji su na razne načine povezani s ovim divnim putem.</p>
<p>Kako biste okusili mali dio mog putovanja pozivam Vas da pogledate dokumentarac o mojoj avanturi.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>
<div>Dakle, ukoliko se odlučite pomoći mi izdati knjigu izravno ćete sudjelovati u snu jednog čovjeka koji je nadišao svoje osobne granice. Od siromašnog dječaka koji je odrastao u ratnom okruženju devedesetih, preko potrage za Bogom u kojoj sam bio na putu da postanem franjevac, pa sve do trenutka kada sam postao prvi Hrvat koji je prehodao Pacific Crest Trail, ali uz muku rastave koja me je na tome putovanju lomila do mjere da je putovanje na mahove postalo uistinu pakleno.</div>

<h3>Utjecaj</h3>
<p>Mnogo je knjiga slične tematike. No, svaka je avantura na neki način jedinstvena. Moja je inspirativna i nadasve emotivna. Ne krijem niti zrnce svoje priče. Patnja je bila sastavni dio moga putovanja i o tome sam morao pisati, ali nije sve bilo patnja i bol. Pozitivni dio priče je ono što inspirira. Dobri ljudi i čudesni suputnici su dobar dio moje pobjede. Američki je vid planinarenja bitno drugačiji od hrvatskog, a moja knjiga tome najbolje svjedoči. Uvjeren sam da će moje iskustvo uvelike utjecati na planinare s naših područja, te da će nakon knjige poželjeti iskočiti iz svoje zone komfora, usuditi se na ono na što su zaista sposobni i proširiti svoj pogled na planine i divljinu!</p>
<p>Ne želim se obogatiti ovom knjigom (da li je to uopće moguće u Hrvatskoj?). Želim da moja priča dođe do što više ljudi, te da ih inspirira. To je moj generalni cilj – inspirirati ljude. Svaku kunu koju zaradim od ove knjige ću uložiti u moj novi projekt – putovanje na Continental Divide Trail (5100 km dugačak trail u SAD-u), a koji planiram za 2018. Dakle, novi dokumentarac i knjiga su već u planu. Štoviše, nova knjiga već ima dvadesetak stranica :)</p>
<h3>Rizici i izazovi</h3>
<p>Svaka crowdfunding kampanja je rizik i izazov. Tako je i  s ovom kampanjom. Ipak, vjerujem da će ljudi prepoznati moju priču kao dobru, poistovjetiti se, poželjeti pročitati o ovom velikom putovanju. Vid kampanje koji sam uzeo je flexible. To znači da koliko god novaca skupio krenuti ću u tisak kako znao i umio. Za kupca s naših područja to znači da će knjigu dobiti kako god se okrene. Naravno, morati će malo pričekati, ali moje su pretpostavke da bi do Božića knjiga mogla pristići na kupčevu adresu :)</p>
<h3>Kako još možete pripomoći</h3>
<p>Neki od vas nemaju dovoljno sredstava da bi kupili knjigu, a željeli bi pomoći. Ili pak, već su kupili knjigu, ali željeli bi učiniti još malo. Nije problem! Moju kampanju možete dijeliti na društvenim mrežama ili kontaktirati novinara kojeg poznajete i sugerirati mu da piše o ovoj temi, ili pak sponzora koji bi volio da mu logo firme bude u knjizi. Uspjeh svake kampanje ovisi o tome koliko ljudi čuje za nju. Naime, kupci knjige koji su zainteresirani za ovakvu priču postoje. Štoviše, ima ih mnogo, no informacija treba doći do njih. Hvala Vam što mi u tome pomažete!</p>

It’s also not hard to identify what separates a manager from a leader. You cannot see these distinctions in the product a workplace may produce, but you can see it in the faces of those individuals behind the product. Their labour can wear on them, breaking their backs under duress, or it can hold them up like a pedestal where they are proud and energized by the space they are a part of. Understanding the differences in what defines a work environment is not an arduous task, carrying out the actions necessary to create that positive workplace is - and it can be a balancing act of genuine nurturing and outgoing gestures of leadership.</span></p><p>People Above Profit examines the direct correlation between success and a positive work environment. In his book, Dustyn Baulkham B.Mgmt. shows how the beating heart of a company is its employees, and the stronger and more lively that heart beats the better the product of its labour. He shows us real world examples of companies that have fostered genuine care in their employees and how that can translate into a better customer service experience, growing the brand as a result. Dustyn tells us of stories involving managers who treat their employees without trust or compassion and how only focusing on the bottom line alienates those integral pieces of a company and can damage the production of a better product or service.</p><p>The limitless aspiration of making one’s being better is the lifeblood that distinguishes Dustyn’s vision from the crowd. Understanding that one can never achieve their “best,” he believes that people are always capable of their better being. In order to attain their better being they need inspiration from leadership and a nurturing, caring environment to create roots in and grow stronger with their colleagues around them. This is why we’ve set up this crowdfunding page, so that we can enact the social change we hope to imbue in businesses worldwide. We want to give you the opportunity to be a part of our vision for a better workspace, a better company motivated to make a change. If you believe in making your being better, or know of a business that could use some help inspiring their employees, help us make that a reality. People Above Profit is the first step towards building the unified company driving to being better.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444949548/yrf9neaiq1iauawzt3se.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><blockquote><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">(Cover Page concept)</span></blockquote><h3><br/></h3><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>Even with humble beginnings and a singular goal of creating a better work space for everyone, this initiative has grown into something beautiful.

Understanding the differences in what defines a work environment is not an arduous task, carrying out the actions necessary to create that positive workplace is - and it can be a balancing act of genuine nurturing and outgoing gestures of leadership.People Above Profit examines the direct correlation between success and a positive work environment. In his book, Dustyn Baulkham B.Mgmt. shows how the beating heart of a company is its employees, and the stronger and more lively that heart beats the better the product of its labour. He shows us real world examples of companies that have fostered genuine care in their employees and how that can translate into a better customer service experience, growing the brand as a result. Dustyn tells us of stories involving managers who treat their employees without trust or compassion and how only focusing on the bottom line alienates those integral pieces of a company and can damage the production of a better product or service.The limitless aspiration of making one’s being better is the lifeblood that distinguishes Dustyn’s vision from the crowd. Understanding that one can never achieve their “best,” he believes that people are always capable of their better being. In order to attain their better being they need inspiration from leadership and a nurturing, caring environment to create roots in and grow stronger with their colleagues around them. This is why we’ve set up this crowdfunding page, so that we can enact the social change we hope to imbue in businesses worldwide. We want to give you the opportunity to be a part of our vision for a better workspace, a better company motivated to make a change. If you believe in making your being better, or know of a business that could use some help inspiring their employees, help us make that a reality. People Above Profit is the first step towards building the unified company driving to being better.(Cover Page concept)What We Need & What You GetEven with humble beginnings and a singular goal of creating a better work space for everyone, this initiative has grown into something beautiful. That something beautiful is growing into a bigger, vaster being than we can handle by ourselves. So, we need your help. We wanted to self publish so that we could write this book our way, they way we believe. As inspirational as that may sound it isn’t cheap. It will cost us nearly $6,000 to fully actualize our self published book, and another $1,000 in marketing and promotion to make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to hear what we have to say.We want you to feel as much a part of this book as we do, so we would like to offer you a few perks just to let you know how much we appreciate your involvement. In addition to those perks, we will be printing 150 hardcover books that will have hand written copy numbers. The first 50 will be going towards our loving family and friends whose generous and limitless support will continue to carry us forward to no end. The remaining 100 will be available exclusively through this campaign, and be offered to those whose belief in this cause goes above and beyond. Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone can contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t help. Having lots of publicity is just as important as monetary contributions, we can’t spread our message if no one can hear us! Please share our Facebook, Twitter, Indiegogo page or join our email list! Everything helps! Thank you!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello there, lovely readers.  My name is Matthew King, and I'm addicted to reading. I hope you are too! :P</p>
<p><b>BookedBox</b> began for me as a seed of anxiety while perusing the gigantic bookstores and the not-my-favorite <i>NYT</i> Bestseller lists.  (Don't get me wrong. I've loved many <i>NYT</i> Bestsellers.  There's just SO MUCH MORE out there.)  I love bookstores and the feeling of being surrounded by hoards of amazing books, but there are so many kinds of different books for so many kinds of different people that the mega-chains don't do it for me.</p>
<p>I missed the local indie bookstores I had in NYC, where every book on display was curated by an amazing staff and would always be an engrossing read.  Despite having a couple great stores near me in Baltimore -- <i>shout-out to Red Emma's and Atomic Books!</i> -- I can't hop from one to another to the next bookstore every week like I could in NYC.  </p>
<p>I want to give everyone, everywhere, the opportunity to have a great, curated reading experience based on what they like to read, not what publishers want them to read!</p>
</div>
<div>Above all else, <b>BookedBox</b> is about books! And you!  And you having more books to read!</div><div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>BookedBox</b> is a curated monthly subscription box tailored to your personal reading habits.  Every month, the <b>BookedBox</b> team will pick out one or more books based on what you've read, genres you love, and any other reading preferences you might have.  </div><div><br/></div>

There are virtually no books on the subject written from the point of view of a person who has Dermatillomania. This little known condition is hard to understand. But with humor, and a touch of spirituality, I shed some light on this dark subject with stories of living with it for the last 30 years.
This particular mental illness relates to body image,  perfectionism, stress release and the illusion of being in control. But ultimately, this book is about the process of arriving at self acceptance. 
The book will be of benefit to others who have this condition, people living with mental illness in general and to those who know and love someone afflicted.
The funds raised will go towards a professional editor, publishing 
expenses and promotion to the general public and to the mental health 
community.


So please make this book happen. 
Besides, the perks make great holiday gifts.                                         
A bit about my professional life: 
I directed
nearly 100 short animated films for UNICEF,

Sesame Street, HBO Family, Nickelodeon and Noggin. I've taught animation to children at venues such as The Museum of Radio and
Television in NYC, Amherst College, University of Pennsylvania and the Aspen
Short Film Festival. 
And I was the focus of the feature length documentary, “Animating Autism’
where I taught children with Autism how to make their own film. The film was featured on theatlantic.com on October 27, 2015. Here's the link.http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/412027/c...


The Editor's bio:
Trish
 Sammer is a journalist, storyteller, and content strategist. She has 
15+ years’ experience in publishing and related industries, working as a
 writer,  editor, and ghostwriter. She currently freelances for The 
Franklin Institute, several technology firms, and other private clients. Trish’s
 goal in working with John is simple: To help him fine-tune his engaging
 stories to allow his unique voice and humor to shine through. She 
suspects the whole process is going to be a hoot.

<div>Alexandra Bliss, Erik Bliss, Shaun Wade, and Drake Raman. The four of them are notable people within Vampire society because Alexandra and Erik are royalty, the current Prince and Princess of Vampires with Alexandra expected to be queen. Drake is an exceptional fighter and one of the most talented members of the Vampire Royal Guard. Shaun, mostly known for her past, has only recently been adopted into Drake's family and become Drake's younger sister. Their lives were normal until the day of Alexandra's 18th birthday celebration at the castle. The party is ambushed by a group of Werewolves asking for ""the four Hybrids"" and everyone is confused because Hybrids are considered a taboo, especially Vampire-Werewolf Hybrids which Alexandra, Erik, Shaun, and Drake just so happen to be. So, my story focuses on the four of them as they try to learn how to control their Werewolf abilities so they can avoid a war and possible execution on the night of the Vampire holiday: the Sapphire Moon.<br/>
</div>
<h3>Why should you read it?</h3>
<div>Sapphire Moon is unlike anything you've ever seen. I made it a point to make sure my story stood out from it's counterparts. Being an avid reader personally, I noticed what parts stood out and helped titles stand out amongst stories in their genre. Authors like Veronica Roth, Cassandra Clare, and Suzanne Collins each have unique elements in their stories that helped them stand out amongst their peers. With fluid story telling and an idea unlike what's been seen amongst my [future] peers, I made it a point to make sure I wrote something people of all ages could enjoy. </div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Angela C. Dixon and I am currently at student at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) in Savannah. I'm from Norcross, GA and there is where I live with my grandmother and her sister who have been raising me since the passing of my mother when I was ten back in 2006. This campaign is to help me raise funds in order to start the publishing process for my book ""Sapphire Moon"" which I've been writing since I've been in middle school. It was published once before but I wasn't happy with the outcome so I removed it from the market and began a <i>major </i>rewrite on it and now I'm finally in a position where I'm happy with the story and I'm confident that others will enjoy it. My family and I don't have the funds in order to publish this book ourselves and I have very little options when it comes to locating them or getting my book out there where someone wants to just publish it without running the risk of someone else stealing my story. This story is what inspired me to become a professional author and with your help I'll be able to achieve that dream and begin my career. </p>

<h3>What it is!</h3>
<p>15-25% of children are still bedwetting by the age of 5 in the US! 6% by 12 years old. Wowsa. Help me reverse this trend back to an acceptable percent by communicating to our kiddos that they are fully CAPABLE of waking to use the potty at night, to eventually take themselves, and that a diaper-free nighttime situation is totally within their reach.</p>
<p><b>The world has been waiting for a pre-bed potty training board book that actually helps young children stay dry at night (and one that can be read to babies as young as 6 months).</b></p>

<p>...and throughout teaching EC and ECing 4 of my own babies from birth <b>I have NEVER found a <i>pre-bedtime </i>potty training board book that provides ALL of the following:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>gives the message that children are capable of being dry all night, from an early age</li>
<li>doesn't include pictures of diapers, or the question of ""should I pee in my diaper or not?""</li>
<li>doesn't teach children it's okay to pee in their bed</li>
<li>doesn't give the message that children should ""wait til they're ready"" (a message created by a Pampers advocate and pediatrician just two years after disposable diapers hit the market - and has doubled our daytime potty training age!)</li>

<li>has humor appropriate for the ages of 6 month-5 years old</li>
<li>makes night pottying ""normal"" from 6 months to 5 years old.</li>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need a total of $5,000 to complete the importing, marketing, and distribution of this book. Again, it is already fully illustrated, written/edited, and printed (which has cost over $5000 of my own money) and is just about here (it's on a boat!).</p>
<p>The $5,000 needed will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 importing duties</li>
<li>$1,000 shipping and storage</li>

<p>The perks involved in this campaign are fun and practical. You will, at the very least, get a beautifully-illustrated, 22 page, 6""x6"" board book (or multiple books, depending on the perk), and <strong>you'll have the option of adding</strong> on any of the following in exchange for your contribution:</p>
<ul><li>Tiny Potty, the prequel to this book, which covers the daytime pottying routine - get 'em together for a great set for your or a friend!</li></ul>

<p><strong>IN SUMMARY, you can support this campaign today by grabbing a solo copy of the new board book, or by pairing it with a variety of essential tools...your choice!</strong> I made all of this stuff to help you and your baby learn and grow into diaper-independence. &lt;3</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact this book will have on the WORLD...</h3>
<p>I have successfully brought 3 books on infant and toddler potty training into the world, organically and over time, and have helped over 50,000 families reduce or elimination their dependence upon diapers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520874357/b73wcctgssrnsdwgu2jj.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>With this book, I want to support our babies and children in reaching this core nighttime competency at appropriate ages <b>(my goal is for children to feel confident finishing nighttime potty training by around 24-30 months, after knowing about the potty since the child's first 6 months of life)</b> with gentle, clear modeling through the character and the character's friend, Bear.<br/><br/><b>The impact on the WORLD is unlimited!</b> Once we change the status quo, more babies and parents will avoid the struggles and medical issues (bedwetting!) associated with <i>late</i> or <i>difficult</i> nighttime potty training, and we can get on with what really matters, more quickly, such as instilling <b>self-esteem, pride in oneself, and an increase in confidence, mobility, and self-care</b>...all results of early day and night potty training!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Risks are low here folks! You're working with a self-taught pro. :) Lessons I've learned with importing my line of Tiny Undies, Tiny Trainers, and one other board book will <i>absolutely</i> help me curb the risks associated with importing these completed books. I have also experienced self-publishing my own 3 books and have learned a lot about getting a book to market...and feel there is no barrier to entry for authors with the right skills.<br/><br/>I am equipped for any challenge, but with the team I've selected and most of the work already done, I am certain this book will be a huge success!<br/> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help: SHARE!</h3>
<p>If you can't fund this campaign directly, no worries!</p>
<p>Please share the link to this campaign via email, Facebook, Twitter, and more <b>(YOU CAN SHARE *EASILY* WITH THE LINKS AT THE TOP OF THIS CAMPAIGN PAGE)</b> to help others find out about it so they can help make it happen. By doing this, you are helping 1,000s of babies and parents <strong>get out of diapers at night</strong>, for good.</p>

I need a total of $5,000 to complete the importing, marketing, and distribution of this book. Again, it is already fully illustrated, written/edited, and printed (which has cost over $5000 of my own money) and is just about here (it's on a boat!).
The $5,000 needed will pay for:

$1,000 importing duties
$1,000 shipping and storage
$3,000 PR, book events, marketing, advertising, and promotion.

If I surpass my goal, I will produce more books and use them to supply our nation's libraries and low income parents with this resource as an outreach project.
What YOU will get!
The perks involved in this campaign are fun and practical. You will, at the very least, get a beautifully-illustrated, 22 page, 6""x6"" board book (or multiple books, depending on the perk), and you'll have the option of adding on any of the following in exchange for your contribution:
Tiny Potty, the prequel to this book, which covers the daytime pottying routine - get 'em together for a great set for your or a friend!

The Nighttime EC 101 minicourse - my fully-digital, comprehensive online course that teaches you whether and how to do nighttime Elimination Communication with your 0-24 month baby

Either of my very popular paperback book packages for parents: Go Diaper Free for 0-18 month babies or The Tiny Potty Training Book for 18 months and up. These kinda complete the whole learning experience by teaching you what to do!
 or 
IN SUMMARY, you can support this campaign today by grabbing a solo copy of the new board book, or by pairing it with a variety of essential tools...your choice! I made all of this stuff to help you and your baby learn and grow into diaper-independence. <3

The impact this book will have on the WORLD...
I have successfully brought 3 books on infant and toddler potty training into the world, organically and over time, and have helped over 50,000 families reduce or elimination their dependence upon diapers.
With this book, I want to support our babies and children in reaching this core nighttime competency at appropriate ages (my goal is for children to feel confident finishing nighttime potty training by around 24-30 months, after knowing about the potty since the child's first 6 months of life) with gentle, clear modeling through the character and the character's friend, Bear.The impact on the WORLD is unlimited! Once we change the status quo, more babies and parents will avoid the struggles and medical issues (bedwetting!) associated with late or difficult nighttime potty training, and we can get on with what really matters, more quickly, such as instilling self-esteem, pride in oneself, and an increase in confidence, mobility, and self-care...all results of early day and night potty training!


Risks & ChallengesRisks are low here folks! You're working with a self-taught pro. :) Lessons I've learned with importing my line of Tiny Undies, Tiny Trainers, and one other board book will absolutely help me curb the risks associated with importing these completed books. I have also experienced self-publishing my own 3 books and have learned a lot about getting a book to market...and feel there is no barrier to entry for authors with the right skills.I am equipped for any challenge, but with the team I've selected and most of the work already done, I am certain this book will be a huge success!

Sky-rocketing rates of depression, anxiety, and addiction are symptomatic of this angst, and my book points to a need for new, integrative vision of and for spirituality and religion—or ""God"" in whatever way we prefer to conceive of this term—in our personal and collective lives. We can't go back to the great traditions to address this need, and so my book explores what we can do to go forward without throwing the proverbial baby—the profound depth of the world's spiritual and religious traditions—out with the bathwater.   </p><p>My book is thus dedicated to seekers of integration: to those who long for the depth but cannot go back to the great traditions or ‘land’ in one perspective; to those who seek a common ground for an emerging collective spirituality that has depth, but who are unsure about how to achieve this. You might be one of many people today who are sensing a call to integrate complexity. In this book, I offer a radical process that can revolutionize your relationship with religion/spirituality, God (however you understand it), and the evolution of our species. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1EfIw9ERSIw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2>Help me share a message of hope, collaboration, and inspiration.</h2><p>My book offers and expansive, inclusive story of the universe we live in. I believe that we owe our children stories and mythologies that can embrace both science and religion, individual and collective journeys, and where all of the critical aspects of human living are addressed and understood to be interdependent. I want to be part of a story where paradoxes are accepted, mystery is celebrated, and soulful living can co-exist with everyday practicalities. </p><p>Our lives are the ink through which this story is told.</p><p>In this story, we are all the protagonist and the supporting cast, the writers and the ‘fictional’ characters. The story combines chaos with harmony, the rhythms of life with the inherent balance of the universe, systemic thinking with radical acceptance. All in all, it is a  meta-cultural attempt to invite more people into what is truly the greatest story ever told—the story of God (whatever your understanding of God may be). </p><p>I invite you and anyone who might be interested to re-imagine our potential as human beings, and to re-claim our place in the story of God. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539638895/awvdugwha0ribzs8omhw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Why this book? </h3><p>In two words, ""Life: Upgraded"". </p><p>This book addresses polarizing discourses in our inner lives, as well as in the realms of politics, religion, and culture. What makes this book stand out is that it offers practical structures that people can use in their own life and communities and answer together, the following questions: </p><ul>
<li><i>How can we address the conflict many of us feel between a need for the sacred in our lives and the lives of our children and our communities, and yet our aversion to relying on old religious structures to address this need?   </i></li>
<li><i>What can you do to feel connected to yourself, others, and God? </i></li>
<li><i>How can you communicate your ideas, worldviews, and needs with others in a genuine, respectful, and compassionate way? </i></li>
<li><i>What does it look like to share a common vision where no one needs to compromise and where everyone can bring their full emerging selves as active participants? </i></li>
</ul><p>So let’s get to work. :)</p><p>________________________</p><h2>Religion? God?  . . . Seriously? </h2><p>It's definitely not easy to sell a book with the words ""God"" and ""Religion"" anywhere in the title these days. Neither are sexy or trendy topics. ""Spirituality"" might get a bit more traction, but so much of what is out there on the ""spiritual"" marketplace feels either shallow or excessively commercialized—stripped of the great depth of the traditions. So, today we face a conundrum. Many of us long for depth, but can't justify going 'back' to religious traditions to find it. My book is a meditation on what going forward could look like for individuals and communities.</p><p>When people ask me about my spiritual affiliation, I occasionally reply by saying (somewhat seriously and somewhat jokingly) that I am a Jewish - Christian - Buddhist - Atheist. I write ‘jokingly’ because many people find it hard to believe that someone so dedicated to the religious impulse and to the emergence of God would be comfortable identifying as an atheist. However, I don't see a contradiction. Instead, I see a maturing and evolving reality that, by its nature, must include a developmental stage that rejects the split of man and God, ‘heaven’ and ‘earth’. This is so difficult to feel into because ‘God’ (or gods), as an archetype in our collective consciousness, has been mostly perceived as a supernatural, omnipotent deity. </p><p>Like so many people before me, I to want to bridge the gap of my experience toward a common ground of understanding and collaboration—not a common belief, nor a mutual respect to agree or disagree. I am seeking a common ground that is new because it is alive.</p><p>I am hoping you want that too. Here's the thing: I feel that God (Spirit, life, creation, call it what you wish) needs us; that the journey of God is two-fold: from God to us and from us to God (both being God!) and the longing for connection is mutual. It is as if God says, ‘help me to know myself’. And in the patience of that longing, love teaches me the language of life and the song of the Cosmos to be of service.</p><p>I wish to reach those who are currenting seeking to reclaim the story of God and to transform the role of the great spiritual traditions in the 21st century. I am not talking about any specific tradition, but the religious heart that is in pursuit of wholeness, integration, and maturation. It's this heart that I believe is at the essence of all authentic religious endeavours.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBjphF7qiGE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><ul></ul><p>______________________</p><h2>Who am I? </h2><p>I am a  registered Clinical Counsellor and Assistant Professor of Counselling Psychology at Alder University based in Vancouver, Canada.

<li>Making sense of our current cultural warfare. </li>
<li>A comprehensive reorientation for our times. </li>
<li>Identifying and expelling the four major social 'symptoms':  (1) extremism and polarizing discord; (2) dislocation and social isolation; (3) ethnocentricity (‘us' vs. 'them’); and (4) narcissism (the cult of personality). All four are adaptive reactions to a culture that is unable to adjust to the growing complexities of our times. </li>

</ul><p>________________________</p><h3>A passage from the book</h3><p><strong>Reclaiming God </strong></p><p>There is a code. Nature abides by it. Life flows because of it. Poets write to describe it and scientists have observed it—each from their distinct perspectives defined by time, history and culture. This code is alive and thus can never be captured nor can it be defined. And yet, we can embody its essence. The code is a call of love to all that is sacred in the Cosmos. It is the future in the now—always evolving, self-organizing, unifying.</p><p>You are part of that code, a miracle 14.7 billion years in the making. You are a child of of the Cosmos, the one and only you, and never will there be another just like you. You are a part and a whole, a whole-part, a “holon”. You are an evolving self-organizing structure composed of cells, tissues, and organs.  You are also a part of an evolving self-organizing structure, composed of other people, things, and places, both endlessly small and endlessly big. Every perception, insight, or truth you have ever experienced is nested in an unfolding grid that is timeless and boundless. You exist at a balance point between chaos and order. And between being and becoming.</p><p>Equilibrium is your goal. Evolution is your quest.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540697508/t5h7zccel9kerauk13va.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><ul></ul></div>","A new hope  I am asking for contributions to get my new book in circulation. it is a game changer because it directly addresses a deep existential angst that so many people are feeling today.

I have had the pleasure of working collaboratively leading workshops with Shahar and have witnessed his capacity to hold a sacred space in group process work. He brings creativity, wisdom and warmth to all he works with and I wholeheartedly recommend him as a therapist.    Chela Davison, Former Director og Leadership & Strategic Innovation, Integral Coaching CanadaShahar brings a depth of wisdom and attuned sensitivity to how he engages and meets others that immediately gets to the heart of the matter. I always feel deeply seen, acknowledged and appreciated in a way that enables me to more deeply see and meet aspects of myself that weren't fully available to me. He's incredibly gifted at deeply listening -- not only to what is being said or not said, but also to what is emerging the space and what is called for. Every time I have the pleasure of connecting with Shahar, I am left with a sense of wider space within myself, greater intimacy with my own needs and practical possibilities for how to carry my new found connection and insight into action. Shahar's style as a therapist and developmental guide is dynamic, curious and so deeply honouring. His care and integrity as a practitioner and human being are inspiring and vast. ________________________How will the funds from this campaign get used? Publishing a book is an epic journey! For me, it started with a deep calling to create practical and effective solutions to the polarizing discourses of our times. What I have to offer matters.

Speak with your friends about the ideas of the book. 
________________________A short overview of the main ideas in the book 1. In search of a sustainable future (providing practical solutions):  
Five principles to end polarizing discord. 
Making sense of our current cultural warfare. 
A comprehensive reorientation for our times. 
Identifying and expelling the four major social 'symptoms':  (1) extremism and polarizing discord; (2) dislocation and social isolation; (3) ethnocentricity (‘us' vs. 'them’); and (4) narcissism (the cult of personality). All four are adaptive reactions to a culture that is unable to adjust to the growing complexities of our times. 
2. The religious impulse as a bridge and the future of religion:
Reclaiming the importance of religion as a bridge to a more collaborative future  
Understanding our emerging role in what I term the “learning and growing God” 
Showing how the ‘religious impulse’ manifests through time and in different cultures 
3. Collaborative spirituality: 
How collaborative spirituality, when done well, can meet not only our personal needs but also our collective needs. 
What is post-individual spirituality?

How to notice red flags and common traps in spiritual work.   
How to move from a traditional leadership model in religious and spiritual organizations into a collaborative model of leadership. 
________________________A passage from the bookReclaiming God There is a code. Nature abides by it. Life flows because of it. Poets write to describe it and scientists have observed it—each from their distinct perspectives defined by time, history and culture. This code is alive and thus can never be captured nor can it be defined. And yet, we can embody its essence. The code is a call of love to all that is sacred in the Cosmos. It is the future in the now—always evolving, self-organizing, unifying.You are part of that code, a miracle 14.7 billion years in the making. You are a child of of the Cosmos, the one and only you, and never will there be another just like you. You are a part and a whole, a whole-part, a “holon”. You are an evolving self-organizing structure composed of cells, tissues, and organs.  You are also a part of an evolving self-organizing structure, composed of other people, things, and places, both endlessly small and endlessly big. Every perception, insight, or truth you have ever experienced is nested in an unfolding grid that is timeless and boundless. You exist at a balance point between chaos and order. And between being and becoming.Equilibrium is your goal. Evolution is your quest.",10.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why we need this</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that half of my life I'm plus size woman, I have decided to do something about this. The best way for me to cope with this is by eating. This summer I have found a new way - writing love stories. After some time, and talking to my friends we noticed that those stories made us thing about all things that we are missing. My imagination got wild and I wrote for days and days. Since than, I have lost 20 pounds, feeling great, attractive and have a new way of coping with my problems.</p>
<p>I believe that out there are many woman that can do this to, but didn't thing of it jet. This is why I would like to publish my first book, activate web page and invite all of them to join me on this wonderful journey that is in front of us.  </p>
<p>Many of my friend have allready read some parts of my book, and they wont more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the fact that I have to work from 8-16 every day, and that I have 12 old son who has puberty issues, dog and husband that is working 2 jobs, finding time to write is hard. But, I manage and hope that one day writing and book clubbing will be my way of life.</p>

<h2>Why Chile Today?</h2>
<p>Globally, Chile is famous for its mountain ranges, lakes and volcanoes, as well as for being home to the driest desert on the planet, and the bottom of the world, Tierra del Fuego. However, the social, political and environmental issues being lived and debated in Chile are inaccessible to the rest of the non-Spanish speaking world, due to the lack of independent Chilean news that is written in English and reported by those living in the country and distributed internationally.</p>
<p>The majority of news about Chile that can be read in online media is produced and published by foreign publications, and doesn’t include stories that reflect daily life and culture in the country, something that is best done by a Chilean publication. It is into this niche that <a href=""http://www.chiletoday.cl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chile Today</a> will fit, with a staff of both international and Chilean reporters and editors, sharing local stories with the world and bringing an independent voice to Chilean media.</p>
<h3>Our audience</h3>
<p>The cornerstone of Chile Today is built on three main pillars –</p>
<ul>
<li>We bring quality content in the form of an independent, critical, free press</li>
<li>We target both Chileans eager to learn English and those who already speak English</li>
<li>We provide expats living in Chile, Chileans living abroad and tourists with a window on everything that moves the country</li>
</ul>
<p> 10% of the Chilean population, or 1.8 million people, speak English. Of the non-<br/>speakers, 82% would study English to improve their employment prospects. Chile is Lonely Planet´s number one destination for 2018. And Chile has a vibrant expat community of English-speakers. Chile Today will be the first dedicated English platform to inform, teach and assist them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Next?</h3>
<p>Chile Today is asking for donations<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'> to professionalize its structure, and to develop an attractive website and a social media strategy. Once Chile Today generates income, editors and staff can be paid, which opens the possibility to expand into investigative journalism and other areas of the field. </span></p>
<p>The initial stage of the project will focus on establishing our online presence: ChileToday.com, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. These will be the channels through which we are able to reach and engage our audience.</p>
<p><i><strong>The funds we raise will be used for the following activities:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Website development: </strong>ChileToday.com will provide our audience with articles, short videos and podcasts. The website will collect content from the newswire as well as original multimedia content from Chile Today staff and interns. Subscriptions and partnerships will allow us to stockpile multimedia content in the form of raw images and footage that can be used as needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Digital marketing:</strong> During the first 12 months of operation, social media will be the primary tool for assessing the interests and engagement of our audience, as well as for expanding that audience. Through reader panels and suggestion threads opened on public social media platforms in Chile, we have already begun to build a better image of the Chile Today reader.</li>
<li>
<b>Premises:</b> In order to expand, hire interns and produce top quality multimedia content, Chile Today will rent offices in a co-working space, based in Santiago, Chile.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tools of the trade: </strong>Finally, we will use the funds fo ensure each of our reporters and interns have high quality tools with which to cover the news, including cameras and recording equipment, as well as the appropriate softwares for editing our multimedia content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>At this stage, all members of Chile Today staff operate on a volunteer basis. Staff is made up of journalists, marketing experts and professionals from Europe, the United States and Chile. All staff is currently based in Santiago, Chile. Chile Today will officially launch in August, 2018.</p>
<h2>Our Impact</h2>
<p>Our focus is two pronged, as we will not only provide news for international readers, but also an educational platform, promoting independent journalism in Chile and Latin America.</p>
<h3><b>News</b></h3>
<p>Stories and reports on Chile Today will come from a combination of original content written by our staff and interns, local contributors, and relevant, high quality content from the newswire.</p>
<p>Content will be published <strong>daily</strong> on the website, with highlights being shared across our multimedia platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Each week</strong>, Chile Today will provide a news roundup, pulling together the most important stories from around Latin America into one, easy to read piece for our readers. This will be published on our social media platforms and distributed via email to our subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Each month</strong>, Chile Today will host a one hour news roundup in English on Radio la Clave, one of Chile’s independent radio stations. This roundup will be hosted by Chile Today staff and interns. </p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>In a country where English-language schools are most accessible for those who can afford private education, Chile Today brings a strong focus on education. Our mission is to enable the younger generation of journalists in Chile to produce strong, local content to be shared globally.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Internships:</strong> Internships with Chile today will be offered to select journalism students twice annually for a period of six months, a placement that will allow students to conduct in-depth reporting on Chilean issues and stories, and to produce long-form articles as well as shorter news briefs. Interns will work directly with Chile Today’s full-time staff, and will be provided with all required technology to produce exceptional content. Interns will have the opportunity to report stories in several different regions of Chile, and will be encouraged and expected to pitch original ideas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Workshops: </strong>Through collaboration with journalism programs at local universities, as well as with English language institutes, both students and teachers will have the opportunity to take part in workshops and trainings with professional journalists from both Chile and abroad, and to have their stories published on Chile Today. Workshops will focus on pitching stories, using multimedia, conducting interviews, assessing the reliability of sources etc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborations: </strong>Chile Today seeks to collaborate with the Journalism faculties at local universities, to more efficiently engage young Chileans who are dedicated to the field and have prior knowledge of good writing and reporting. Those who wish to work with Chile Today will have the opportunity to be mentored by a professional journalist, as well as with our editors to prepare their stories for publication. These collaborations will provide aspiring journalists with published bylines, equipping them with robust portfolios as they enter their careers.</p></li>

</div><p>Thank you all very much for your interest and support. We look forward to bringing you independent, local news from Chile and beyond.</p></div>","Why Chile Today?
Globally, Chile is famous for its mountain ranges, lakes and volcanoes, as well as for being home to the driest desert on the planet, and the bottom of the world, Tierra del Fuego. However, the social, political and environmental issues being lived and debated in Chile are inaccessible to the rest of the non-Spanish speaking world, due to the lack of independent Chilean news that is written in English and reported by those living in the country and distributed internationally.
The majority of news about Chile that can be read in online media is produced and published by foreign publications, and doesn’t include stories that reflect daily life and culture in the country, something that is best done by a Chilean publication. It is into this niche that Chile Today will fit, with a staff of both international and Chilean reporters and editors, sharing local stories with the world and bringing an independent voice to Chilean media.
Our audience
The cornerstone of Chile Today is built on three main pillars –

We bring quality content in the form of an independent, critical, free press
We target both Chileans eager to learn English and those who already speak English
We provide expats living in Chile, Chileans living abroad and tourists with a window on everything that moves the country

 10% of the Chilean population, or 1.8 million people, speak English. Of the non-speakers, 82% would study English to improve their employment prospects. Chile is Lonely Planet´s number one destination for 2018. And Chile has a vibrant expat community of English-speakers. Chile Today will be the first dedicated English platform to inform, teach and assist them.

What Next?
Chile Today is asking for donations to professionalize its structure, and to develop an attractive website and a social media strategy. Once Chile Today generates income, editors and staff can be paid, which opens the possibility to expand into investigative journalism and other areas of the field. 
The initial stage of the project will focus on establishing our online presence: ChileToday.com, Facebook, Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. These will be the channels through which we are able to reach and engage our audience.
The funds we raise will be used for the following activities:


Website development: ChileToday.com will provide our audience with articles, short videos and podcasts. The website will collect content from the newswire as well as original multimedia content from Chile Today staff and interns. Subscriptions and partnerships will allow us to stockpile multimedia content in the form of raw images and footage that can be used as needed.

Digital marketing: During the first 12 months of operation, social media will be the primary tool for assessing the interests and engagement of our audience, as well as for expanding that audience. Through reader panels and suggestion threads opened on public social media platforms in Chile, we have already begun to build a better image of the Chile Today reader.

Premises: In order to expand, hire interns and produce top quality multimedia content, Chile Today will rent offices in a co-working space, based in Santiago, Chile.

Tools of the trade: Finally, we will use the funds fo ensure each of our reporters and interns have high quality tools with which to cover the news, including cameras and recording equipment, as well as the appropriate softwares for editing our multimedia content.

About Us
At this stage, all members of Chile Today staff operate on a volunteer basis. Staff is made up of journalists, marketing experts and professionals from Europe, the United States and Chile. All staff is currently based in Santiago, Chile. Chile Today will officially launch in August, 2018.
Our Impact
Our focus is two pronged, as we will not only provide news for international readers, but also an educational platform, promoting independent journalism in Chile and Latin America.
News
Stories and reports on Chile Today will come from a combination of original content written by our staff and interns, local contributors, and relevant, high quality content from the newswire.
Content will be published daily on the website, with highlights being shared across our multimedia platforms.
Each week, Chile Today will provide a news roundup, pulling together the most important stories from around Latin America into one, easy to read piece for our readers. This will be published on our social media platforms and distributed via email to our subscribers.
Each month, Chile Today will host a one hour news roundup in English on Radio la Clave, one of Chile’s independent radio stations. This roundup will be hosted by Chile Today staff and interns. 
Education
In a country where English-language schools are most accessible for those who can afford private education, Chile Today brings a strong focus on education. Our mission is to enable the younger generation of journalists in Chile to produce strong, local content to be shared globally.

Internships: Internships with Chile today will be offered to select journalism students twice annually for a period of six months, a placement that will allow students to conduct in-depth reporting on Chilean issues and stories, and to produce long-form articles as well as shorter news briefs. Interns will work directly with Chile Today’s full-time staff, and will be provided with all required technology to produce exceptional content. Interns will have the opportunity to report stories in several different regions of Chile, and will be encouraged and expected to pitch original ideas.
Workshops: Through collaboration with journalism programs at local universities, as well as with English language institutes, both students and teachers will have the opportunity to take part in workshops and trainings with professional journalists from both Chile and abroad, and to have their stories published on Chile Today. Workshops will focus on pitching stories, using multimedia, conducting interviews, assessing the reliability of sources etc.
Collaborations: Chile Today seeks to collaborate with the Journalism faculties at local universities, to more efficiently engage young Chileans who are dedicated to the field and have prior knowledge of good writing and reporting. Those who wish to work with Chile Today will have the opportunity to be mentored by a professional journalist, as well as with our editors to prepare their stories for publication. These collaborations will provide aspiring journalists with published bylines, equipping them with robust portfolios as they enter their careers.

<p>The Story</p>
<p>Cami and Wyatt are back in another funny and relatable book by best selling author Stacy C. Bauer.</p>
<p>Cami and Wyatt love their screen time. Watching movies and playing games on their tablets is so much fun! But are they missing out on other fun things? Could they be ignoring their friends and family? Will Cami and Wyatt be able to figure out a healthy screen time balance and find their way back to the real world?  </p>
<p>My illustrator, Rebecca Sinclair, is hard at work on the book. Illustrations that will be just as amazing as the first two books. I'm so thankful to be working with her on this series. Rebecca uses colored pencils to create each illustration by hand-  you can tell how much work and love she puts into each one!  </p>

<p>I've wanted to be a published writer since I was a child. 3 years ago, on a leave from my teaching career, I decided to go for my dream. I ran successful Kickstarter campaigns in 2017 and 2018 and was able to publish the first 2 books in my series about my children Cami and Wyatt. In the fall of 2019, I had a coloring book and stuffed kangaroos created and published an interactive activity book about kindness. I was excited to find out my hardcover books won 4 book awards!  </p>
<p>My hopes and dreams for this series:</p>
<p>*FAMILY. That it brings families closer. </p>
<p>*EMPOWERMENT. That it empowers children to make good choices.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out our campaign. If you watched the video, you know what we’re doing – working <i>creatively</i> to defeat Donald Trump and his minions in Congress this November. No small task.</p>
<p>But this is not a political campaign fundraiser. No PACs or donations to politicians. This is the power of original, entertaining, and informative content that fuels our planned social media campaign, and done right, drives earned media with its novelty and message.</p>
<p>And for a couple of bucks, you can help see it done.</p>
<h3><strong>Why a book?</strong></h3>
<p>That’s a question Trump would ask since he doesn’t read them unless they’re full of pictures and his name. This book meets both of those criteria, but I don’t think he’ll like it.</p>
<p>We need a book that focuses on one topic and puts it into perspective from beginning to end. A book that people will read and enjoy and understand. Not a 6,000 word NY Times article (as good as those are), but something for folks outside the Beltway, folks who aren’t obsessed with cable news. A book that covers the most important topic leading into the upcoming election - the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Deceit and distraction are Trump’s weapons of choice, and we can’t let today’s <i>rage du jour</i> mute all his previous blunders. A book can remind us that yelling “<i>Obamagate!</i>” doesn’t make the tragedy of a pandemic mismanaged and denied go away.</p>
<h3><strong>Why this book?</strong></h3>
<p>Pretty much the same reason – it’s full of pictures! But these pictures are special.</p>
<p>First, they’re Trump’s own words throughout the crises, and available on video. No denial can make them disappear.</p>
<p>Second, each one is accompanied by a scathing picture, an editorial cartoon that communicates a message instantly and unequivocally. In this case, the truth behind Trump’s lies.</p>

<p align=""center"">See? Did you get that message? Will you remember it? Any questions?</p>

See details at <a href=""http://www.libraryinaweek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.libraryinaweek.com</a>.</p><p><strong>The Book Cover</strong></p><p>The book cover has a profound meaning and connection to the Power of Purpose Framework. While building library #20 in the Grassy Narrows First Nations Reserve, Sultan and his family met Jason Fobister <a href=""https://youtu.be/6tdbm-Ls-zU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/6tdbm-Ls-zU</a>. He quickly became a part of the family and was the inspiration for his daughters to launch <a href=""http://www.twosistersonamission.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twosistersonamission.com</a>. Jason flew in to attend a very special dinner where Sultan’s tribe of 200 change makers from around the world had gathered and on stage, in that moment, Jason surprised him with a 6 feet by 5 feet painting he took 1 year to paint for Sultan. There are four stages in this painting. The end of the earth represents the point where you achieve all that you consider success, illustrating those moments where your purpose truly reveals itself (the tree with the energy around it). The eagle represents your will to listen to it and the signs of the creator that will take you to the light you were always meant to be in the universe. It will help you unleash your potential and make a real difference in your life and in the lives of others. This is precisely why, the book cover is -for the Power of Purpose Framework to help us all take flight towards our deeper purpose in life.</p><p><strong>Other Offerings</strong></p><p>The world needs not just our inspiration but our action. Sultan would love to partner with you to deliver a keynote or corporate training at your workplaces. This will directly help impact the people involved as well as provide the necessary funds for the projects. Reach out to him to schedule an introductory call at <a href=""mailto:info@experienceyourlife.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@experienceyourlife.ca</a>.</p><p>The following two offers are customized. Please reach out for a quote based on your event size and organization:</p><p>6) Keynote Speech: Unleashing Potential through Power of Purpose as a team, organization, or individual.</p><p>7) Corporate Training: Human Centric Digital Transformation through Power of Purpose.</p><p><strong>The Power of Purpose Framework</strong></p><p>Here is a sneak preview of some of the topics. The framework will contain over 20 poems, visualizations, worksheets, and references that bridge the world of science, spirituality, impact, and action. </p><p>This frame is carefully modelled to be simple, actionable, and relatable so you can conquer your self-doubts and accelerate your potential-. It balances the inner and outer worlds by focusing on themes such as a purpose-driven career, your body, finances, tribe, enjoying your life, the energy field around you, emotions, and business models! These topics are seldom in a single framework and that is what makes it extremely difficult for guidance to be actionable. Sultan uses the 6 core pillars of fitness, finances, friends &amp; family, faith, fun, and freedom, and an additional 30 underlying sub-topics (5 under each) to truly help you align your body, mind, and soul in the service of your purpose. The guidance is logical, actionable, and focused to anchor you in a place where you do not feel conflict between what you must do and what you want to do in life. This will open your eyes to where you truly experience internal and external peace and how you are surrounded by people who believe in you and your brilliance. As a sneak preview, the flow of the framework is as follows:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Life:</strong> This is where you can take a step back. Guided by worksheets and simple tasks, take inventory of what is working in your life, what you can tolerate, and what must change. We then visualize, vividly and in detail, what life can be like in the future and what activities, people, and beliefs, belong in that space to help you achieve true happiness.</p><p><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs: </strong>No building can be constructed on the foundation of quicksand. The more you build, the more the building tilts out of control. The same is true for a transformation in life. It cannot be achieved on the foundation of self-limiting beliefs such as doubt, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, low opinion of worth and dependence on external approvals for defining satisfactions. This part of the framework goes deep into each issue and provides you with a set of tools and techniques to overcome the beliefs and habits and reinforce them over and over again. Exiting this phase of the framework, you will have a higher understanding of what has been really holding you back and how you can surmount it in the future. One of the poems in this section is, ""I am Enough, or so I am told.... But at every turn of my life, a feeling of doubt takes hold"".</p><p><strong>3)</strong> <strong>Connecting with Purpose:</strong> One of the poems in the framework is, ""Life is a gift, not something to be sold. It is a story you are writing, not one you are told"". A life without purpose is a like a ship caught in a storm, or a motorboat with the fastest engines in the world, but with nowhere to go. Purpose gives life meaning. When we truly connect with it, it changes everything in our lives. Connecting with his purpose led Sultan to transform every aspect of his physical, mental, and spiritual life, and the techniques to achieve the same will now be accessible to you. Moving out of this phase, you will achieve a much better understanding of your real purpose, what inspires you, what moves you down to the core, and what helps you sleep better at night. One of the poems in this section reads, ""Give yourself permission, to feel the way you feel"".</p><p><strong>4) Power of Purpose Pathway: </strong>Inspiration without action leads to no impact. Similarly, guidance without a pathway can be hard to follow and implement. This part of the framework goes deep into the actual science of change, and deep scientific analysis of each recommendation as well as references to additional reports, books, and articles. </p><p><strong>4.1:</strong> <strong>Fitness: </strong>Your body is a miracle. Millions of cells, vessels, systems, and organs work together for you to take that one breath. Yet, as we get busy in life, we neglect this one gift which is our vessel to connect with the external world. Energy stops flows and disease follows along with impacts on our mental wellbeing. Sultan lost nearly a 100 pounds following advice passed down for thousands of years as well as his own research on what empowers the body and helps it flow again. He now competes in endurance races and is about to complete his first iron man – a 2 km swim, 90 km bike ride, and a 21 km run– – that you can too.</p><p><strong>4.2</strong>: <strong>Finances:</strong> Too many change makers neglect this important aspect of life. On the other hand, too many people focus on it non-stop at the expense of other pillars of life. Harvard research shows that after earning $75,000 dollars annually, there is no correlation between happiness and wealth. This topic dives deep into the various ways you can achieve financial freedom, and educate you on created offerings and services that make the world a better place, yet still allow you to meet your financial obligations and overall reshape your relationship with money. Brace yourself for some life changing content in this section!</p><p><strong>4.3 Friends and Family:</strong> This pillar focuses on the important aspect of your tribe consisting of friends and family. Those individuals have your back and help you achieve greater impact in the world. The section focuses on the importance of choosing your circle of friends very carefully, techniques to build a real tribe around your projects and your life that empowers you on just as your presence - them, and will  break the cycle of transactional relationships to make room for ones that alleviate the soul.</p><p><strong>4.4 Faith:</strong> This topic focused on the importance of faith, whatever it may mean for you, in your overall well-being and happiness. It empowers you to develop a stronger, but more real relationship with what you believe in and then translate that into action. It encourages you to dive deep within, so your faith becomes a source of internal strength and not an outwardly projection. This topic is sensitive for many people, but that is why it deserves focus and attention in a transformation framework. Sultan is not a very religious person, but a deeply spiritual one. He has built libraries in partnerships across all major religions, from temples, churches to mosques. One of his favorite quotes is, ""The best way I can show my love to you (God), is to love all humans"". </p><p><strong>4.5</strong> <strong>Fun: </strong>Life is not a struggle. It is not a chore. It is not a set of responsibilities you must do, neither is it a burden. Life is a gift. It is a miracle to be enjoyed, appreciated, treasured, and experienced. Sultan named his company “Experience Your Life” for one reason. He saw so many people struggle through life changing milestones, but they were not enjoying the journey and escaping to places where they can lose themselves temporarily because the reality is too hard to bear - he believes there is a better way. A path in which you can give your dreams the space to shine again, a place where you do not question your worth but spend your time trying to have impact.  Life is a journey, guided by eternal light. It is not a destination but a path we choose and enjoying your life while you experience it is incredibly important.</p><p><strong>4.6</strong> <strong>Freedom: </strong>There is a poem in this section called freedom. It goes deep into the realization that most of what we believe is either inherited or absorbed from society. What is truly 'us' in the mist of societal beliefs? Can we say we are truly free if all we do is reflect beliefs of those immediately around us? Have we dived deep within to touch into universal truths that float through all around us - independent of our place of birth - but empowering in their simple truth about equality, love, harmony, respect, and co-existence?  This part of the framework will push you to challenge your most basic assumptions about yourself and prompt you to redefine your identity to be one that glows universally with impact, light, and love. </p><p><strong>5) Bringing it all together around Purpose:</strong> This section focuses on constructing an explicit action plan, accountability framework, and an energy circle to amplify the change in your life and in the lives of others and more tangible next steps in the days, weeks, months, and years to follow. </p><p><strong>Sultan is going ALL-IN to finalize this work</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626303797/jrsy3ycz14q0wokredlq.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>In Sultan's own words "" </strong>For it to impact your heart and drive change - this life changing work deserves deep authenticity and clarity. I find that at the brink of physical exhaustion which is why I did the 280 km walk, 500 km bike ride and other endurance trips. Now - to write the final chapters of this framework &amp; go ALL-IN on the Future of Education conference I have decided to relocate to Calgary &amp; the Rockies for 40 days where I will be doing 6 endurance races/triathlon starting with a half-marathon. The big one will be the Half Iron Man on 1st August and while I am only doing the bike/run option (90 km ride / 21 km run) - the chances of not making the bike cutoff are really high (The route is 1.5 km elevation across 90 km at speeds that I barely touch on flat ground) .. none of that matters.. it's about showing up and giving it my all. It is about being at the foothills of mountains and diving deep within. It is about taking all that inspiration and finishing this framework so it can help others. I will post (to my network only so connect if you are not already in it) as it plays out. I hope through that you find your own inspiration to keep taking the next step and unleashing the reservoirs of strength and not be shackled by outcomes.""</p></div>","SummarySultan Akif's purpose in life is to set change makers in motion by helping them overcome self-limiting beliefs through Power of Purpose. 100% of all profits from the launch of this framework will go towards delivering the library builds and scholarship programs Sultan runs. Post launch, he will continue to donate 50% of all profits from all his projects to his cause for life. Life is simply too short and the purpose too important to do it any other way!It took soul searching by traveling to 80 countries in the world, gaining and then losing 100 pounds, personal experience with poverty, then delivering over 1 billion dollars of consulting revenue, building 37 libraries in 10 countries, building the largest youth employment event in Canada and keynotes to hundreds of thousands of people around the world for Sultan to finally create this framework. It is his life's work and one through which he plans to fulfill his purpose of setting change makers just like you in motion at scale by helping people see how powerful they really are, helping them have a set of guiding steps to develop directional clarity and measure their progress, supporting them in developing a better relationship with their body, their mind and their soul, so they can make a real difference in this world while having joy and happiness in their own lives.You can see the summary of Sultan's work in the video and visit the websites at www.experienceyourlife.ca, www.libraryinaweek.com, www.futureofeducationconference.com , www.twosistersonamission.com (his daughters) and https://www.linkedin.com/in/sultanakif/.&nbsp;. This framework is not about his story but rather to make the wisdom accessible to you that is carried forward for thousands of years and his own ideas that helped him go from inspiration to actionDuring his travels, his corporate experience, and his life overall - Sultan witnessed a lot of people pass through life struggling to connect with their potential, their worth, their happiness and their impact. He saw tremendous light in them but many times the person’s self-limiting beliefs limits that light depriving the universe (including their work, relationships, and self-opinion) of their unique energy.

See details at www.libraryinaweek.com.The Book CoverThe book cover has a profound meaning and connection to the Power of Purpose Framework. While building library #20 in the Grassy Narrows First Nations Reserve, Sultan and his family met Jason Fobister https://youtu.be/6tdbm-Ls-zU. He quickly became a part of the family and was the inspiration for his daughters to launch www.twosistersonamission.com. Jason flew in to attend a very special dinner where Sultan’s tribe of 200 change makers from around the world had gathered and on stage, in that moment, Jason surprised him with a 6 feet by 5 feet painting he took 1 year to paint for Sultan. There are four stages in this painting. The end of the earth represents the point where you achieve all that you consider success, illustrating those moments where your purpose truly reveals itself (the tree with the energy around it). The eagle represents your will to listen to it and the signs of the creator that will take you to the light you were always meant to be in the universe. It will help you unleash your potential and make a real difference in your life and in the lives of others. This is precisely why, the book cover is -for the Power of Purpose Framework to help us all take flight towards our deeper purpose in life.Other OfferingsThe world needs not just our inspiration but our action. Sultan would love to partner with you to deliver a keynote or corporate training at your workplaces. This will directly help impact the people involved as well as provide the necessary funds for the projects. Reach out to him to schedule an introductory call at info@experienceyourlife.ca.The following two offers are customized. Please reach out for a quote based on your event size and organization:6) Keynote Speech: Unleashing Potential through Power of Purpose as a team, organization, or individual.7) Corporate Training: Human Centric Digital Transformation through Power of Purpose.The Power of Purpose FrameworkHere is a sneak preview of some of the topics. The framework will contain over 20 poems, visualizations, worksheets, and references that bridge the world of science, spirituality, impact, and action. This frame is carefully modelled to be simple, actionable, and relatable so you can conquer your self-doubts and accelerate your potential-. It balances the inner and outer worlds by focusing on themes such as a purpose-driven career, your body, finances, tribe, enjoying your life, the energy field around you, emotions, and business models! These topics are seldom in a single framework and that is what makes it extremely difficult for guidance to be actionable. Sultan uses the 6 core pillars of fitness, finances, friends & family, faith, fun, and freedom, and an additional 30 underlying sub-topics (5 under each) to truly help you align your body, mind, and soul in the service of your purpose. The guidance is logical, actionable, and focused to anchor you in a place where you do not feel conflict between what you must do and what you want to do in life. This will open your eyes to where you truly experience internal and external peace and how you are surrounded by people who believe in you and your brilliance. As a sneak preview, the flow of the framework is as follows:1) Life: This is where you can take a step back. Guided by worksheets and simple tasks, take inventory of what is working in your life, what you can tolerate, and what must change. We then visualize, vividly and in detail, what life can be like in the future and what activities, people, and beliefs, belong in that space to help you achieve true happiness.2) Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs: No building can be constructed on the foundation of quicksand. The more you build, the more the building tilts out of control. The same is true for a transformation in life. It cannot be achieved on the foundation of self-limiting beliefs such as doubt, low self-esteem, lack of confidence, low opinion of worth and dependence on external approvals for defining satisfactions. This part of the framework goes deep into each issue and provides you with a set of tools and techniques to overcome the beliefs and habits and reinforce them over and over again. Exiting this phase of the framework, you will have a higher understanding of what has been really holding you back and how you can surmount it in the future. One of the poems in this section is, ""I am Enough, or so I am told.... But at every turn of my life, a feeling of doubt takes hold"".3) Connecting with Purpose: One of the poems in the framework is, ""Life is a gift, not something to be sold. It is a story you are writing, not one you are told"". A life without purpose is a like a ship caught in a storm, or a motorboat with the fastest engines in the world, but with nowhere to go. Purpose gives life meaning. When we truly connect with it, it changes everything in our lives. Connecting with his purpose led Sultan to transform every aspect of his physical, mental, and spiritual life, and the techniques to achieve the same will now be accessible to you. Moving out of this phase, you will achieve a much better understanding of your real purpose, what inspires you, what moves you down to the core, and what helps you sleep better at night. One of the poems in this section reads, ""Give yourself permission, to feel the way you feel"".4) Power of Purpose Pathway: Inspiration without action leads to no impact. Similarly, guidance without a pathway can be hard to follow and implement. This part of the framework goes deep into the actual science of change, and deep scientific analysis of each recommendation as well as references to additional reports, books, and articles. 4.1: Fitness: Your body is a miracle. Millions of cells, vessels, systems, and organs work together for you to take that one breath. Yet, as we get busy in life, we neglect this one gift which is our vessel to connect with the external world. Energy stops flows and disease follows along with impacts on our mental wellbeing. Sultan lost nearly a 100 pounds following advice passed down for thousands of years as well as his own research on what empowers the body and helps it flow again. He now competes in endurance races and is about to complete his first iron man – a 2 km swim, 90 km bike ride, and a 21 km run– – that you can too.4.2: Finances: Too many change makers neglect this important aspect of life. On the other hand, too many people focus on it non-stop at the expense of other pillars of life. Harvard research shows that after earning $75,000 dollars annually, there is no correlation between happiness and wealth. This topic dives deep into the various ways you can achieve financial freedom, and educate you on created offerings and services that make the world a better place, yet still allow you to meet your financial obligations and overall reshape your relationship with money. Brace yourself for some life changing content in this section!4.3 Friends and Family: This pillar focuses on the important aspect of your tribe consisting of friends and family. Those individuals have your back and help you achieve greater impact in the world. The section focuses on the importance of choosing your circle of friends very carefully, techniques to build a real tribe around your projects and your life that empowers you on just as your presence - them, and will  break the cycle of transactional relationships to make room for ones that alleviate the soul.4.4 Faith: This topic focused on the importance of faith, whatever it may mean for you, in your overall well-being and happiness. It empowers you to develop a stronger, but more real relationship with what you believe in and then translate that into action. It encourages you to dive deep within, so your faith becomes a source of internal strength and not an outwardly projection. This topic is sensitive for many people, but that is why it deserves focus and attention in a transformation framework. Sultan is not a very religious person, but a deeply spiritual one. He has built libraries in partnerships across all major religions, from temples, churches to mosques. One of his favorite quotes is, ""The best way I can show my love to you (God), is to love all humans"". 4.5 Fun: Life is not a struggle. It is not a chore. It is not a set of responsibilities you must do, neither is it a burden. Life is a gift. It is a miracle to be enjoyed, appreciated, treasured, and experienced. Sultan named his company “Experience Your Life” for one reason.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Our grandpa used to tell us, while we were still little kids, that there is a great person and a mediocre person inside each of us. He would add that only one of them could rule at any given time, and that the game of life is to determine which person should rule – the great person or the mediocre person.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I started to notice the finer nuances between the great person and the mediocre person inside me.</p>
<p>For example, the great person might say:<i> “Your book really needs expert editing.”</i></p>
<p>The mediocre person would reply: <i>“I can’t afford it.”</i></p>
<p>The great person might say: <i>“Your book’s interior design can be more attractive.”</i></p>
<p>The mediocre person would reply: <i>“I can’t afford it.”</i></p>
<p>The point is that whenever both are confronted with a radical idea, the great person responds differently from the mediocre person. While the mediocre person is screaming, <i>“I can’t!”</i> the great person is wondering, <i>“How can I?”</i></p>

<p>Even though I have edited books professionally for seven years, you’d be shocked to learn that I acquired a lot of my copy-editing wisdom while engaged in other facets of life. Here are three invaluable copy-editing lessons that I learned from life and music-making.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Before You Boost</strong><br/>So you’ve completed that paragraph but you’re not quite satisfied with it? Don’t be tempted to add new lines right away. Embellishing the problem will not make it go away. To eliminate the problem, look for parts to delete. Try and see if you can rewrite the same paragraph with fewer words. Only after you’ve done your cutting should you try to embellish it.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Is Best</strong><br/>Cut to the chase! Highlight the strong point in your descriptive and eliminate everything else. Don’t be tempted to introduce complexity because the story feels too simple. When you remove the extraneous, that extra line, you give the rest the space to shine.</p>
<p><strong>Less Is More</strong><br/>Don’t narrate it in one paragraph if you can narrate it in one line. Don’t be tempted to believe that more is better. Too many unnecessary lines will make your story cheap. Less is expensive. When you aim to use fewer words, even the blandest line acquires a sudden importance that cannot be matched with more words. Keep only what the reader needs to know.</p>
<p>In the end, only the best parts will be remembered. So, leave only the best parts. Immerse yourself in your story and highlight only the best parts of it.</p>
</div></div>","Introduction
Our grandpa used to tell us, while we were still little kids, that there is a great person and a mediocre person inside each of us. He would add that only one of them could rule at any given time, and that the game of life is to determine which person should rule – the great person or the mediocre person.
As I grew older, I started to notice the finer nuances between the great person and the mediocre person inside me.
For example, the great person might say: “Your book really needs expert editing.”
The mediocre person would reply: “I can’t afford it.”
The great person might say: “Your book’s interior design can be more attractive.”
The mediocre person would reply: “I can’t afford it.”
The point is that whenever both are confronted with a radical idea, the great person responds differently from the mediocre person. While the mediocre person is screaming, “I can’t!” the great person is wondering, “How can I?”

<p><strong>Write Bloody Publishing is an independent poetry publishing company based in Los Angeles, with an imprint in Canada and soon – if all goes to plan – the UK.</strong></p>
<p>I’d been submitting poetry manuscripts to Write Bloody for around 3 years to no avail before I realised that they didn’t accept international submissions. Gutted. Write Bloody are the crème de la crème of independent poetry publishing with their snappy vibe, soft touch covers and book tours. To have them publish me was a life goal of mine. Not just advocates for the written form, each WB author commits to a 20 show tour around the United States, giving book readings and building a fan base. There is absolutely nothing like this in the UK. Nothing.</p>
<p>Ok we have a few quirky literary journals and digital platforms, but manuscript competitions tend to be found on tired websites producing small, dated books. The golden opportunities are exclusive to youth poets, and unless you’re picked up by a major publisher or have been writing since you were young enough to get yourself onto The Foyles Young Poets scheme or into your University’s press, it’s tough. Thank god for The Poetry Café &amp; South Bank Centre.</p>
<p>When Write Bloody posted on Instagram that they had opened an imprint in Canada, I commented as a half-joke, “If you ever need a Write Bloody UK I’ll run it for you.” I did not expect the founder, Derrick C. Brown to take me up on the offer. After months of emails back and forth and a couple FaceTimes, I’ve decided to pull the trigger. There are a myriad of talented poets in the UK who are limited to sharing their work on Facebook statuses or Tumblr. The chance of getting their poetry into good-quality print is low without an agent. I know there are a ton of writers hiding amongst us with a hell of a lot to say who just need a place for it. For their words to be bound up, beautified and performed to the world. I want Write Bloody UK to be the bridge that enables this and I need your help.</p>

<p>Some people say that when it rains it can be a sign from God.  In Homer's Iliad, Zeus rained <strong>blood</strong> on the battlefield during the battle of Troy.  The fighting was intense and it was on that battlefield drenched in blood that some of the most heroic acts ever witnessed by men took place and were immortalized by Homer's pen. </p>
<p>Not all battles are fought with swords... or guns... or bombs.  Some battles are fought with <strong>words</strong> <strong>and ideas</strong>.  Battlefields like these can be found anywhere there are people who seek the power to control.</p>

<p>These battles of words and deeds dwell all around us and can even wage within our own minds.  We live in a society today, which has over time watered the seeds of war, but there is still time to cultivate the seeds of peace.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>War: A love Story</strong> is a book about a patriotic young man whose life is deeply rooted in religion and dedicated to the cause of fulfilling his American Dream.  From childhood he devoted his life to joining the military and following in the footsteps of his Grandfather who was a Lt. Colonel in the Air Force and who took part in top secret missions during Vietnam and the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p>Just as he begins to realize his dream though, something goes terribly wrong which catapults him into a journey of self discovery on the American road and abroad.  His adventures and hardships seem to echo at times those of the character Candide who was first imagined by the french philosopher Voltaire.</p>
<p>In his search to find new meaning, and as his old life crumbles all around him he finds himself living in another country and re-discovering his spiritual and earthly roots.  With this reawakening of passion inside of him he sets out to mend with worn out tools those things he once held sacred in order to restore his honor before it’s too late.</p>

<h3>Who is Charles Voltaire?</h3>
<p>Charles Voltaire is an idea.  He was first imagined as a joke, then as a pen name, until eventually he became a symbol of something bigger then the author himself.  His words stream from his eyes to his pen and with each stroke he connects ideas, symbols, and stories revealing deeper mysteries long since forgotten.  </p>
<p>He symbolizes that part in all of us that wants to be heard — that part of us that wants to do what’s right and speak up but doesn’t know how.   He embodies everything you wish you could have said if you’d had the courage to speak your mind without fear of the ramifications.  He’s a sinner but his conscience is clear because he took the time to confess his story.  He’s Rodin’s “Thinker,” naked and perched atop the gates of hell pondering a way to clothe his pride so he can make his way home to Eldorado.  </p>
<p>Love him or hate him but don’t question his honesty.  He wears his heart on his shoulder and the power of his speech and actions are tattooed on his face.  He uses myth as a tool to tell his story and is rooted in poetry.  He is a soldier only his weapons are far more powerful then those of conventional warfare and just like a samurai he carries two swords on him at all times.</p>

<h3>Who am I (and what am I doing)?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Welcome! Devin Griffiths here, and very pleased to see you. I’m a professional writer, published author, and second-generation obsessed birder. I’ve spent most of my life around birds, and I’d like to take you with me on an adventure into their world through my book, <i>A Symphony Of Feathers: Life In The Company Of Birds.</i> It's a personal journey that explores the lives of these wonderful creatures and our enduring connection to them, and shows readers how critically important birds are to our mental and physical health, and indeed to our very survival. It examines the challenges they face, the work people are doing to conserve them, and what each of us as individuals can do to help build them a better world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here’s the story</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The challenges confronting birds are great--among them natural ones like finding food, raising young, and the pressures of migration, to man-made threats like habitat loss, disruption of resources, and climate change. But the reasons to conserve them are greater. From providing ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pest and disease control, beach stabilization, and pollination, to serving as the ultimate canaries in the coalmine, alerting us to potential environmental problems, birds are critical to maintaining and monitoring the health of the environment on which we all depend.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">But this story is about more than saving birds for our benefit. It’s about understanding the critical roles they play in the environment at large, and respecting them as equally deserving of living the full measure of their lives free from harm. And it’s about reimagining the role of our own species on this planet—and our place as part of the web of life upon it—and creating a new story of humanity, casting us as ardent protectors, preservers, and stewards of the Earth and all who inhabit her.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can you do?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Each day, the threats to birds grow more serious; every day that passes is another vanished opportunity to help them. Throughout my life, birds have been a constant source of solace and joy. <i>A Symphony Of Feathers</i> is my way of giving something back; funding this project can be yours. Help me bring <i>A Symphony Of Feathers</i> to life. Help me tell their story, and together we can ensure that our world always has a place for these magical creatures. </p>
<h3>So where’s the money going, anyway (and what do you get for it)?</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Every dollar I raise goes directly towards getting this book done—from research and writing all the way through production and distribution (okay, maybe a meal or two along the way). The more I raise, the more books I can create, and the more people I can reach—which is, yes, good for me, but it’s even better for the birds. Contribute what you can—and don’t forget to check out the perks! The world is full of amazing birds, and I’ve picked some of my favorite images to share with you. Can’t decide which you like best? No problem! There are a couple of special packages that give you more than one (and they make great gifts for the bird lover in your family). You can also get a copy of the book (once it’s complete, of course), have me over for a reading, get the photos and the book… there are infinite options (well maybe not infinite, but there are quite a few). Check back once in a while, too; you never know what I might add! And remember to spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers, bring it up casually at parties, shout it from the hills if that’s your thing, but let people know. If enough of us get involved, who knows what we can accomplish?</p>

From providing ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pest and disease control, beach stabilization, and pollination, to serving as the ultimate canaries in the coalmine, alerting us to potential environmental problems, birds are critical to maintaining and monitoring the health of the environment on which we all depend.
But this story is about more than saving birds for our benefit. It’s about understanding the critical roles they play in the environment at large, and respecting them as equally deserving of living the full measure of their lives free from harm. And it’s about reimagining the role of our own species on this planet—and our place as part of the web of life upon it—and creating a new story of humanity, casting us as ardent protectors, preservers, and stewards of the Earth and all who inhabit her.

What can you do?
Each day, the threats to birds grow more serious; every day that passes is another vanished opportunity to help them. Throughout my life, birds have been a constant source of solace and joy. A Symphony Of Feathers is my way of giving something back; funding this project can be yours. Help me bring A Symphony Of Feathers to life. Help me tell their story, and together we can ensure that our world always has a place for these magical creatures. 
So where’s the money going, anyway (and what do you get for it)?
Every dollar I raise goes directly towards getting this book done—from research and writing all the way through production and distribution (okay, maybe a meal or two along the way). The more I raise, the more books I can create, and the more people I can reach—which is, yes, good for me, but it’s even better for the birds. Contribute what you can—and don’t forget to check out the perks! The world is full of amazing birds, and I’ve picked some of my favorite images to share with you. Can’t decide which you like best? No problem! There are a couple of special packages that give you more than one (and they make great gifts for the bird lover in your family). You can also get a copy of the book (once it’s complete, of course), have me over for a reading, get the photos and the book… there are infinite options (well maybe not infinite, but there are quite a few). Check back once in a while, too; you never know what I might add! And remember to spread the word. Tell your friends, your family, your co-workers, bring it up casually at parties, shout it from the hills if that’s your thing, but let people know. If enough of us get involved, who knows what we can accomplish?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

By the time I returned to the book - three kids and several years later - Photoshop had been born.

This is especially important for an unusual book like LILY POND because people don't always realize that the illustrations are sculpted rather than computer generated. Thanks to Indiegogo, they can learn how Lily came to be, how the illustrations were made and what they were made from. Potential backers can learn of a young frog determined to seize life and the young woman determined to tell her story.A Mother's LoveSelf-publishing LILY POND allows me to control not only the book's content and print quality, but also its publicity and longevity. I'll make sure that LILY POND is still visible and available long after the new season of books have pushed LILY's contemporaries off the shelves at Barnes & Noble. The Genesis of LILYWhen I was six, my siblings and I started building a clay town with some old balls of colored modeling clay. My parents, remarkably, let it stay, and Claytown grew to become the centerpiece of our childhoods. After college, I started sculpting clay illustrations for a poem I had written about growing up called “Lily Pond.” I honed my skills to become a freelance 3D artist in San Diego, New York and Los Angeles, eventually working as a character sculptor on The Nightmare Before Christmas, Toy Story and as the sculpting supervisor on James & the Giant Peach. I kept working on LILY POND over the years, sculpting and finishing the scenes as time and life allowed.I met my husband shortly after the final illustration had been photographed. We were both pushing forty, so once my work on James & The Giant Peach was over I set LILY POND aside and quit ""show business"" to start a family. By the time I returned to the book - three kids and several years later - Photoshop had been born. With the help of Gary Karsten, my image editor and ""computer hands,"" LILY POND's twenty-three illustrations were gradually Photoshopped to perfection.Raves & Reviews!“On the eve of her eighth birthday, a young frog dreams of her future in Shelley Daniels Lekven’s new book, LILY POND. Ms. Lekven’s remarkable illustrations – all sculpted by her hand in colored clay – are eye-opening works of wonder and imagination that should make this sweet tale a children’s book classic.”– HENRY SELICK, Director, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline“Years ago, Shelley Daniels Lekven introduced me to the fantastic world of LILY POND, her picture book featuring amazing and whimsical hand sculpted clay scenes, telling the charming story of a little girl frog’s dreams for the future. This is a book you can gaze at repeatedly and always find something new and wonderful. Shelley Daniels Lekven’s immense sculptural and storytelling talent comes through on every delightful page. The world of LILY POND is immersive and joyous. This is a book for everyone.”– KELLY ASBURY, Director, Shrek 2, Gnomeo & Juliet, Smurfs – The Lost Village“The playful world of LILY POND  bursts with childhood joy and imagination, and celebrates a child’s unwritten tomorrows, full of endless possibilities. Shelley is such a gifted sculptor that I knew a book illustrated entirely by her magical all-clay scenes would be something very special. LILY POND is the kind of book that should be out there in the hands of children.” - GREG DYKSTRA, Sculptor, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Finding Nemo, Brave and Up “This lovely book for children, and the child in all of us, provides a totally new and wonderful way of imagining life’s possibilities. The messages of empowerment and inclusion flow cheerfully throughout both the story and its delightful illustrations.”– THE REVEREND FRANK PLACONE-WILLEY, Minister, Summit Unitarian Universalist Fellowship“I am so impressed by the detail, craftsmanship and thought in this work. A true delight. Genius.” – JENNY SAAR, Artist/Illustrator“LILY POND is exactly the type of book I would have spent hours staring at when I was a kid.” - LINDSEY B. “My mom sat looking at the castle for an hour.”- RAYNA M., age 10 “This book makes me feel… happy!”- DENISE T., age 50Risks & ChallengesThe book files have gone to the printer, the proofs have been approved and five thousand copies will arrive from China by the end of December. While printing and shipping the book from China is surprisingly inexpensive, just $1.46 per book, other related expenses have been adding up ($583 for proofs, the computer work needed to get the files ready and sent, etc.). A successful Kickstarter campaign for LILY POND just closed with $4400 in funds, but the net profit from that will only cover about a third of the printing costs. Funds from this Indiegogo campaign will be used to help fill the gaps.Any additional funds will be used toward:

<p><strong>The Novel</strong></p>
<p>The outcome of several years of research. It exposes the truth about a small elite group of capitalists who, with the collaboration of key political figures, now lord it over our world.</p>
<p>The novel draws heavily on historic record: press archives, government and intelligence agency records to expose the rise and continued existence of a secret cabal of Internationalists who have gained monopoly control over money and credit. They now wield inordinate influence over the determinants of the global economy that has so adversely impacted our planet, and that defines how we live our lives. This is the story about our need to take back ownership of the problems that now threaten to deprive our children of the life we had hoped, like us, they would enjoy.</p>
<p>The theft of sovereign wealth, terrorism, money laundering, the drug trade, war, religion, and relentless environmental destruction - along with the privatisation of everything are all integral to the story.</p>
<p><u><strong>Do you have a favourite test-read review?</strong></u></p>
<p>Yes: An exciting read and an animated exchange. However, I would be cashing in any loyalty program points before you publish. There won't be any discounts coming your way. Lol.</p>
<p><u><strong>What other comments have I had?</strong></u></p>
<p>Genuinely enjoying it, just very confronting given I just don't think this way or conduct my life in a manner that allows this sort of premeditated (dare I say it) evil to exist. I live in the suburbs, walk dogs, put out rubbish bins, paint things and maintain gardens. This is heavy stuff. It's not naivety, just a lack of exposure to this type of thinking. I use YouTube for DIY videos.</p>
<p><strong><u>Book Comment Snippet</u></strong></p>
<p>Please tell me [he] dies a painful horrible death somewhere along the way. He is a must needed foil for your story, but what a pig. Surely James gets tired of all this and at least beats him up.</p>
<p><strong><u>Book Comment Snippet</u></strong></p>
<p>Still hard to believe that this is available info, that dedicated people have found it and written about…. We are no longer talking economic principles of competitive advantage, but deliberate control of economic instruments and outcomes. Sad isn't it.</p>
<p><strong><u>Book Comment Snippet</u></strong></p>
<p>[She] doesn't sound so nice any more. A distant sort of person that having the so-called good fight on paper, but is not happy, not ready to commit (I suspect a bit selfish) and is using her beau. A bit hypocritical for me. </p>
<p><u><strong>Have you completed your final edit, and if so what did the editor say?</strong></u></p>
<p>The copy edit has been completed and the novel is now ready to be typeset prior to the first proof.</p>
<p><u>The copy editor's comments were</u>:<br/>Works well.<br/>The writing is solid.<br/>I liked the way you situated most of the non-fiction element in the middle, and brought it back to the story more at the end - that was nicely done.</p>
<p><u><strong>So what do you think about the current state of play?</strong></u></p>
<p>I think 2008 was merely the tide draining away ahead of the Tsunami that's about to hit, both in economic and environmental terms. Economic collapse will pave the way for more draconian government. While the environmental disaster that is happening right before our eyes will result in crops dying in the ground, water deprivation, disease and starvation; which will be great for some – a very few – as they drive up the cost of water and food while destroying the middle, and upper middle classes as they drive us back towards a neo-feudal existence.</p>
<p>That said, I'm also confident that change is within our grasp. We just all need to get nto the same page. Stephen Hawking predicted we had about a 1 in 20 chance that global warming would destroy our planet within a single lifetime. Which, at least to my mind was a challenge; it doesn't have to end like this, not if we all come together in pursuit of the dreams our great grandparents and their parents had for their future generations just a century ago. If we act now, collectively, and we're radical but not extreme in our thinking - we might still just have a small glimmer of hope.</p>
<p><u><strong>So are you a crazy conspiracy theorist?</strong></u></p>
<p>No, although I'm sure that's the spin the mainstream would put on it. To borrow cliché - I do believe that the truth is typically far stranger than fiction. And often a lot scarier - which is why I spent the first couple of years buried in research, fact-checking everything. And why I went back to the likes of the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, and the And the UK’s climate coalition with a request that they fact check my interpretation of the evidence and facts as the last thing I want is to be bashed with the fake news stick.</p>
<p><u>I<strong>s this another example of Fake News?</strong></u></p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. I've been meticulous in my research. When I'd finished my final draft I passed the novel to organisations like the Climate Change org, and the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth to fact check ... not that this is  novel just about 9/11 or climate change. They are events that are used to give context to the narrative that exposes the ambition of a few men whose greed for power and wealth has reshaped our world for the worst.</p>
<p><u><strong>Why should you read this novel?</strong></u></p>
<p>My hope is that it might just change the way you think about the world around you. And if the novel achieves that, then it might just also help us all find a few alterntive answers to the rather cataclysmic problems now confronting us.</p>

<p><strong>Author Biography</strong></p>
<p>GEORGE, uninspired by the sunshine of California, lives a quiet, albeit hectic life under grey skies in the UK's second city, Birmingham. An MBA graduate, he built his career over  several decades in the corporate world.  He also conceived and developed strategies to shape consumer opinion, for the clients of some of London’s leading creative agencies.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the growing levels of inequality, the rise of what he believes to be neo-feudalism disguised as neoliberalism, along with the destructive impact of globalisation, George opted to explore poverty as a writer. Why? Because he believes the journey towards change and securing a future for our children, in a world that sits on the brink of a economic and environmental collapse, begins with insight. He was, and is, determined to become a voice for change.</p>
<p>Now, having comfortably achieved his first objective of exploring poverty first hand while researching and writing an informative and engaging factual fiction novel - and having learned to mix a stonkingly good Long Island tea - he's now out to achieve his second goal of spreading the message. To do this, he needs your help to get his first novel out into a global market in as many languages as possible.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When you experience loss, especially if it's the end of a relationship, it feels like you've been sucker-punched by a giant. Knocked down, the world spins out of control and nothing makes sense anymore. Heart break cripples people for years, decades, sometimes even for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong><i>Has that been your story?</i></strong></p>
<p>It doesn't have to be that way. You can experience the hell of heartbreak and become something more. You can become whole. I know you can because I did.</p>
<p>I'm a regular dude who has experienced both personal loss and living with fears and insecurities for years and years. I used to be fearful, insecure and pretty codependent. I was unaware of some of this stuff. But when my worst fear of rejection &amp; abandonment came true, I was met with a very startling reality.</p>
<p>I had to decide if I was going to let it break me or if I'd dig deep to overcome the issues within myself. Instead of blaming those who hurt me, or turning on myself, I utilized a core principle gained from an unlikely source from my past: my brief stint in amateur boxing.</p>
<p>This book is the culmination of this healing journey. It's a guide for how to heal, rebuild yourself and birth a new life without pain, fear or regret.</p>
<p>The Be Solid book includes the method and lessons learned along the way and the tools I've gained to restore my heart and mind to new levels. This is my transformation story and method that you can use to become your best self after experiencing your worst pain.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Who's This Book For? Who Should Read It?</h3>
<p>Have you experienced personal loss? This is for you. Have you experienced heartbreak? This book is for you. Do you feel stuck in anxiety and worry? This book is for you.</p>
<p>But here's the thing....</p>
<p><i>Heartbreak, loss and feeling stuck are all human conditions.</i> All of us have experienced it in some form or fashion. When your heart suffers, everything in your life goes dark and hope seems completely lost.</p>
<p>This book project is about healing. It's about loss not being what defines who you are as a person, nor determines your future. This book and everything in the Be Solid brand is about wholeness, restoration and transformation into your best life and best self.</p>
<p>Which we hear a lot, right? ""Become your best self"" is stuff the self-help gurus talk about a lot. I'm not interested in being a guru. I am interested in living a life of peace, satisfaction, happiness, and completeness. Getting free from insecurities, shame, fear, doubt, worry, anxiety and everything else like that.</p>
<p><i>How about you?</i></p>
<p>If you've struggled with self-doubt, a need for validation from others, fears, shame, worries, or anxieties then this book is exactly what you are looking for to be free.</p>You'll learn not only the principles that guide a whole and solid life, but also gain the action steps to take along the way in your own healing journey.<p> </p>

<p>I've got a storied life of overcoming challenges and obstacles. Professionally I'm a syndicated radio host, life &amp; personal development coach, and speaker.</p>
<p>Which looks like a lot of big wins and success on the outside. But on the inside, I used to be scared and full of fear. That fear ruled a lot of how I thought about myself, which caused problems in relationships and kept me from experiencing growth and success for many years. It also made me a pretty codependent person, which led to some issues I wasn't even aware of until my marriage came to a sudden end.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I experienced some very deep personal loss that the game changed for me. <i>I was confronted with the reality that I either had to change myself or I had to give up trying because nothing was going to be like it was. </i>There is no going back to ""normal"" after heartbreak, especially when it's a relationship. You either heal yourself or you carry the weight of that pain with you for the rest of your days.</p>
<p><strong>Which is why pain can be transformational if you let it.</strong> It's like how gold becomes truly valuable. It has to go through the most intense fires to burn off all the junk that's attached to it so that it can become pure. That fire is hot as hell! So is the pain of heartbreak.</p>
<p>It's not easy, don't get me wrong. Healing and becoming whole after you've been broken and experienced loss is hard. But if I can do it, you can do it. This book is about the healing process that I've been on. And the process involves overcoming very deep-seated fears you may be carrying with you from childhood. I had a lot of fears growing up that I talk about in the book, and I talk about the steps I took to overcome them.</p>
<p>There's no fear that controls my actions or behaviors anymore. Confidence, peace, strength, and wholeness are regular ways of thinking and behaving now. I'm not perfect or close to it. But life feels a whole lot better on this side now.</p>
<p>Everything I share in this book is true because I've lived it. And from the experiences of healing the broken places in myself, I've been able to lead and coach countless people in their personal transformation and wholeness.</p>
<p>I look forward to being able to do much more of that through the funding of this project to deliver these tools and resources to people all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Is This Project A Game Changer?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you've ever felt unworthy or not good enough (who hasn't?), the emotional turmoil of heartbreak and loss seems to confirm that terrible belief. It makes you feel like what you had wasn't worth fighting for. Which is debilitating. And something all of us fear.</p>
<p>But here's the thing:</p>
<p>You get to decide what to do with your life when you're faced with your worst fears.</p>
<p>Who will you become. Will you be someone who carries anger, resentment, bitterness, rage, and pain with you?</p>
<p>Will you let your experiences negatively impact your relationships, your business, your family life and your health?</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556378025/wctd2fngxfq2lubrqrt3.png"" src=""""/>Everything is connected. Heartbreak doesn't just hurt in one place. It carries over into every area of your life.</strong></p>
<p>That's why when you experience it, it's like going through hell. You can't compartmentalize hell.</p>
<p>When I lost my marriage I had to quit the entrepreneurial business I had because I lost all of the confidence I had in myself. I took a very challenging job to be able to build that confidence back. I was scared of a LOT of stuff. But I didn't want to make decisions that would fuel more brokenness. So I chose to let that experience be the transformational vehicle to become the best version of me.</p>
<p>In just 2 years time, I've restarted my business working with people in helping them heal and grow. My confidence is at an all time high. I have peace in my life. I enjoy my time and my friends. I've discovered new hobbies and traveled more. It's easier than ever to make friends and bring healthy relationships into my life. I'm physically the healthiest I've ever been and exercise regularly.</p>
<p><strong>Because when you seek wholeness in your life, everything changes.</strong> You come into the fullness of who you really are. Not hiding yourself out of fear, and not dependent on anyone else's validation. It's true freedom.</p>
<p>That's what this book and this project is all about. I'm serious about helping people who have been through this gut-wrenching experience of heartbreak. I want to help those who are going through it now, and those who are helping a loved one go through it be transformed.</p>
<p>I believe that pain can be the catalyst for a better life if you will let yourself go through the healing process in this book. I'm committed to helping to break the tragedy of hurting people hurting others. That cycle is real.</p>
<p>This book is a game changer because it changes the dynamic of who you are. Don't be a victim. Instead, become a  conqueror.</p>
<p>You have the power within you to become a solid individual. You just need the tools, guidance, and empowerment to make the necessary changes and move forward. Fortunately, you have me and this book.</p>
<p>Your support of this project helps me to be able to spread healing and wholeness to throughout the world so that hearts can be made whole from brokenness.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Does This Campaign Goal Cover?</h3>
<p>Yes the book is written. But it still needs to be formatted and readied for publishing. While ""writing"" a book like this has emotional/mental costs of living through the healing process described, it's also already had financial costs. I've invested thousands of my own dollars, borrowed resources from others, and done good faith deals to have everything that is currently in place. But I can't do this on my own. To be able to publish and put it out into the world (meaning to make it available for you to read in print, ebook, or audiobook), I need you to partner with me in supporting this campaign.</p>
<p>The campaign goal also covers the costs of promotion, marketing, design and other items. These costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the initial print run and audiobook publishing</li>
<li>editor's fees,</li>
<li>promotion/PR services,</li>
<li>video production,</li>
<li>graphic design</li>
<li>copy writing</li>
<li>website design and hosting</li>
<li>additional merchandise (Solid T-Shirts!!!)</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>I'm a big supporter of people who work to change the world, which is one reason I do what I do. In that vein, I'll be contributing 10% of everything we raise in this campaign to Big Brothers Big Sisters to help make more young people solid in life.</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>**BONUS**<br/>For everyone who contributes at a perk level (click each button to see what the perk level includes) with a Paperback copy ($35 or more), <i><strong>the paperback copy will come to you autographed with a special note inside.</strong></i> Another reason to contribute to this campaign and not wait for the book to be released to the general public.</p>
<p>Mention of you will also be included in a special video following the conclusion of this campaign where I will name you (and provide a pic if you send one in) and thank you for your help in making people all over the world more solid and whole.</p>

<h3>Why You Should Support This Book Launch</h3>
<p>This transformational book has taken two years to write and develop. Getting it published and into your hands quickly is why I need your help.  Supporters of this campaign get to read it before the rest of the world. Which means I'll personally send you a copy before it's ""officially"" released. That's first dibs!</p>
<p>Which means that you get bragging rights in saying that this book happened because of you!</p>
<p>The Be Solid book is a method, process, and guidebook into healing all in one. But there's more to help you in your healing to transform into the best version of yourself.</p>
<h3>I'm committed to helping people heal and live their best life! This campaign gives more people more ways to benefit from this method and system for healing. The book, coaching, and speaking opportunities are all available in one place for those who want to really dive deep.</h3>
<p>If you want more than the book and want a personalized, one-on-one experience in transforming your life into wholeness, that is available (at a discount) through this campaign. The Be Solid Coaching Program is where you work with me directly in a 6 month program. In it we walk together through the steps in the Be Solid process for wholeness and healing. It's life coaching on a higher level of personal development, wholeness, and growth.</p>
<p>If you have a business or group that can benefit from the inspiration and motivation of this story, you have the opportunity to bring the full keynote presentation to your event, meeting, or group.</p>
<p>All of these options are available at the different perk levels (click each button to the right to see what's inside and what's included).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we'll divvy up the funds that we do raise and allocate them to the sections we can cover. This campaign is designed to help us spread the healing and restoration method to the world to help people in our existing communities as well as those in other areas. ,</p>
<p><strong><i>Every dollar you contribute goes to making that goal happen.</i></strong></p>
<p>The book is about healing and wholeness. So is the program. And the coaching. And the keynote presentation. Everything here is about changing the dynamic of your life from brokenness into wholeness.</p>
<h2>You are worth fighting for!</h2>
<p>It's a statement you'll see me use a lot. Because owning your worth and being solid in who you are is the key to operating out of wholeness.</p>
<p>Your investment in this project gives healing and inspiration to yourself while also helping someone else have the chance to experience it too.</p>
<p>On top of contributing money to our chosen nonprofit, we're also going to contribute books to our local Big Brothers Big Sisters organization so their personnel and the people they serve can be positively impacted too!</p>
</div><div>
<p>My biggest desire is to help people who've been in similar shoes as I have come out of their brokenness and into the richness of themselves. When you believe in yourself, fully love yourself, and operate from confidence, everything in your life improves. Your interpersonal relationships are strong and vibrant. You have peace in your days. Your business endeavors become easier and more successful. And you love the life you live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Every person wants to feel love, respect, and be successful. Don't you?</strong> But too often we let experiences and the trauma that life hits us with determine the story that we live out. You can choose to be bigger than your circumstances and become something that changes the world. This project gives you what you need to heal and become a force for good in a broken world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556378139/ssmw68kqmiwdkzfuzmps.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Vulnerability is risky. Talking about personal pain is risky. Spending 2 years going through a difficult healing process and writing about it is risky. Devoting the time, focus, money, and energy into a project that I believe in with all my heart and continuing with it for over a year is risky.</p>
<p>There's a lot of risk attached to this project already. But you know what? It's worth it. Because the healing has been worth it. So has the transformation. I'm 10x the man and human I was before everything broke down. In a way, I'm very thankful for this experience (despite how difficult and painful it was) because of what it produced.</p>
<p>The transformation I've been able to help others experience through coaching and speaking is worth it. Helping people go through their darkness to discover that the light on the other side is actually inside them. That's worth it.</p>
<p><u>Here's where the book stands right now:</u> This book is written, edited,  is being readied to print. There are still a few things we need to add/correct before we hit ""Print."" This campaign ensures that we will publish it in the next few months.<br/><br/>We will make advanced reader copies (in digital format) available to those who support this campaign as a way to kick off the launch of the book. We will also provide additional opportunities for early adopters through the Be Solid Program and keynote speech to supporters of this campaign before we release it to the world.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Real Challenge</strong></u></p>
<p>The biggest challenge for us is getting as many people as possible to hear about the book and the platform. Marketing and promotional endeavors can be bootstrapped, but you and I both know that doing so limits the amount of reach and exposure that can bring.</p>
<p>I'm not interested in playing small in this book release because I want to help as many people as possible live a full and whole life. Restoration is the message here, and spreading the love about this book actually spreads love to the world.</p>
<p><strong><i>Personal growth is not just a book genre, it's a reality for those who seek it.</i></strong> This book is a resource to achieve that, and help countless people find the healing, peace, and transformation they seek.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help and support to help me turn the Be Solid message of transformation out of brokenness into a person who can take on life's biggest challenges.</p>
<p>As you can see from the breakdown, the majority of costs we're funding with this program allows us to take the message and materials to people all over the world for a positive change in people's lives.</p>
<p>The more funds we raise on top of our goal will go to continuing this endeavor of spreading healing and love to people who have experienced loss for their transformation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>If you want to contribute in a way that is more than financial, you can talk up this book and this campaign with people in your life who can benefit the most from it.

<p>Please use the Indiegogo sharing tools to spread the word about this campaign, and be sure to write something in the post too. When you speak, it has so much more power than just clicking a share button. Plus, we want to hear what you have to say about this project!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, contributions, and joining us in spreading love to the world. You're a solid person for doing so!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
When you experience loss, especially if it's the end of a relationship, it feels like you've been sucker-punched by a giant. Knocked down, the world spins out of control and nothing makes sense anymore. Heart break cripples people for years, decades, sometimes even for the rest of their lives.
Has that been your story?
It doesn't have to be that way. You can experience the hell of heartbreak and become something more. You can become whole. I know you can because I did.
I'm a regular dude who has experienced both personal loss and living with fears and insecurities for years and years. I used to be fearful, insecure and pretty codependent. I was unaware of some of this stuff. But when my worst fear of rejection & abandonment came true, I was met with a very startling reality.
I had to decide if I was going to let it break me or if I'd dig deep to overcome the issues within myself. Instead of blaming those who hurt me, or turning on myself, I utilized a core principle gained from an unlikely source from my past: my brief stint in amateur boxing.
This book is the culmination of this healing journey. It's a guide for how to heal, rebuild yourself and birth a new life without pain, fear or regret.
The Be Solid book includes the method and lessons learned along the way and the tools I've gained to restore my heart and mind to new levels. This is my transformation story and method that you can use to become your best self after experiencing your worst pain.
 

Who's This Book For? Who Should Read It?
Have you experienced personal loss? This is for you. Have you experienced heartbreak? This book is for you. Do you feel stuck in anxiety and worry? This book is for you.
But here's the thing....
Heartbreak, loss and feeling stuck are all human conditions. All of us have experienced it in some form or fashion. When your heart suffers, everything in your life goes dark and hope seems completely lost.
This book project is about healing. It's about loss not being what defines who you are as a person, nor determines your future. This book and everything in the Be Solid brand is about wholeness, restoration and transformation into your best life and best self.
Which we hear a lot, right? ""Become your best self"" is stuff the self-help gurus talk about a lot. I'm not interested in being a guru. I am interested in living a life of peace, satisfaction, happiness, and completeness. Getting free from insecurities, shame, fear, doubt, worry, anxiety and everything else like that.
How about you?
If you've struggled with self-doubt, a need for validation from others, fears, shame, worries, or anxieties then this book is exactly what you are looking for to be free.You'll learn not only the principles that guide a whole and solid life, but also gain the action steps to take along the way in your own healing journey. 
Who is this guy who's trying to make boxing a healing sport?

I've got a name you won't forget: D Grant Smith. You can call me D (that's what my friends do!).
I've got a storied life of overcoming challenges and obstacles. Professionally I'm a syndicated radio host, life & personal development coach, and speaker.
Which looks like a lot of big wins and success on the outside. But on the inside, I used to be scared and full of fear. That fear ruled a lot of how I thought about myself, which caused problems in relationships and kept me from experiencing growth and success for many years. It also made me a pretty codependent person, which led to some issues I wasn't even aware of until my marriage came to a sudden end.
It wasn't until I experienced some very deep personal loss that the game changed for me. I was confronted with the reality that I either had to change myself or I had to give up trying because nothing was going to be like it was. There is no going back to ""normal"" after heartbreak, especially when it's a relationship. You either heal yourself or you carry the weight of that pain with you for the rest of your days.
Which is why pain can be transformational if you let it. It's like how gold becomes truly valuable. It has to go through the most intense fires to burn off all the junk that's attached to it so that it can become pure. That fire is hot as hell! So is the pain of heartbreak.
It's not easy, don't get me wrong. Healing and becoming whole after you've been broken and experienced loss is hard. But if I can do it, you can do it. This book is about the healing process that I've been on. And the process involves overcoming very deep-seated fears you may be carrying with you from childhood. I had a lot of fears growing up that I talk about in the book, and I talk about the steps I took to overcome them.
There's no fear that controls my actions or behaviors anymore. Confidence, peace, strength, and wholeness are regular ways of thinking and behaving now. I'm not perfect or close to it. But life feels a whole lot better on this side now.
Everything I share in this book is true because I've lived it. And from the experiences of healing the broken places in myself, I've been able to lead and coach countless people in their personal transformation and wholeness.
I look forward to being able to do much more of that through the funding of this project to deliver these tools and resources to people all over the world.

Everything is connected. Heartbreak doesn't just hurt in one place. It carries over into every area of your life.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Larissa Soehn and I struggle with depression and anxiety. I am also a mother and a wife, who is just doing her best.</p>
<p>During my depression I have learned that there will be times when the depression will force me to step back from being a mother and put myself first. </p>
<p>That is why I created this book.  I found that I was spending a lot of time explaining to my daughter why I needed some 'me time'.  We talk a lot about our emotions, and it became common in our house hold to say 'mommy is having a sad day.'</p>
<p>I want to share this with other families, to help children understand that adults struggle with strong emotions too.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The artwork and the test was all put together by myself, so the publishing costs are relatively low.  That being said, there are still costs associated to printing.  The printing cost for 100 books is roughly $1500 plus shipping (approx. $500).</p>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will go directly to printing costs. If we happen to raise more money than needed, the remainder will be donated to the Mental Health Foundation. </p>
<p>This campaign is set up with two perks;  </p>

</div></div>","Summary
My name is Larissa Soehn and I struggle with depression and anxiety. I am also a mother and a wife, who is just doing her best.
During my depression I have learned that there will be times when the depression will force me to step back from being a mother and put myself first. 
That is why I created this book.  I found that I was spending a lot of time explaining to my daughter why I needed some 'me time'.  We talk a lot about our emotions, and it became common in our house hold to say 'mommy is having a sad day.'
I want to share this with other families, to help children understand that adults struggle with strong emotions too.
What We Need & What You Get
The artwork and the test was all put together by myself, so the publishing costs are relatively low.  That being said, there are still costs associated to printing.  The printing cost for 100 books is roughly $1500 plus shipping (approx. $500).
The money raised from this campaign will go directly to printing costs. If we happen to raise more money than needed, the remainder will be donated to the Mental Health Foundation. 
This campaign is set up with two perks;  

Book pre order. The release date is planned for November 2021. 
A split donation. Half will go towards the printing costs, and the other half will be donated to the Mental Health Foundation. 

The Impact
Mental health is a very real and very impactful health condition. I want both parents and children to understand that adults struggle too. I want to help remove the stigma around mental health and give people an easy way to start the conversation with their children. 
Mommy is Having a Sad day is a look into how depression can impact someone, but also how it impacts the children. 
Risks & Challenges
This book is 1 of 4 that I have in the works of being published. Without the support of generous donors, I will not be able to publish this book this year.
While we do not need to meet 100% of the goal to publish, we will need to meet 50% of it to take it to the printers. 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot donate, that is perfectly fine. The next best thing to a donation is a kind word.  Share the campaign and get the message about mental health out there.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<strong>Urashima Taro</strong> is a storybook meant for learners of all ages. Children especially have a burning curiosity and a desire to learn, while adults often over-complicate the learning process making it harder for themselves; this storybook help fulfill these needs by providing an enjoyable and very easy to read.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629649181/feobigru2b28pjiovcqd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Urashima Taro consists of more than 40 beautifully drawn full color pages with a glossary section and a background section explaining a brief history of the Urashima Taro folktale. Designed as a read-aloud book, the stories are a perfect length for bedtime or classroom reading with just a couple pages. Each of the illustrations were beautifully designed by the illustrator, Claudie C. Bergeron.</p>

<p><strong>Urashima Taro </strong>is a heartwarming yet funny story about a young fisherman who, one day, rescues a small turtle. Little does he know, that turtle is the daughter of the Sea Dragon God and that his good deed will lead him on a incredible journey. A few days, a messenger turtle arrives and invites him to go to the Dragon God's palace to reward him for his good deed. There, he falls in love with the Sea God's daughter, Princess Otohime, and parties with everyone for an unspecified amount of time there. Eventually, he does gets homesick.</p>

<p>Missing his parents, Urashima decides to head back home. But before he leaves, Princess Otohime, the Sea Dragon God's daughter gives him a jewellery box and warns him never to open it. After traveling for a few days, Urashima arrives back to discover that his village has become a city and that his house is gone. Asking around, Urashima eventually finds someone and discovers that 300 years have passed. His family is gone and he is considered dead.</p>
<p>In the original version, a disheartened Urashima goes to his family grave and opens the jewellery box. Only to be covered in white powder and turned into a old man left to mourn what he has lost. However, as with all folktales, the stories of Urashima Taro vary depending on the region, era and literature of the time. In the original eighth century version, Urashima was known as <strong>Urashimako, </strong>though the story ended very similarly. In some versions, Urashima opens the box and a spirit of a woman appears, causing Urashima to realize that he can never go back to the realm of the Gods again. In another version, Urashima just straight up dies. In others, he turns into a crane and is left to circle his family grave. In another, he takes some medicine, grows gills and uses them to swim back to Otohime.</p>

<p><i>The Urashima Taro statue located at the Ryugu Shrine in Ibusuki, Japan</i></p>
<p>In the Otogi Bunko version, Urashima is given a three-tiered box by Otohime instead. And when he opens the box, he discovers a crane feather in the first drawer, gets turned into an old man with the powder in the second and discovers a mirror in the third drawer. Pulling out the mirror, he discovers that he has been turned into an old man. Mourning, suddenly, the wind picks up and the crane feather touches Urashima's back, transforming him into a crane. Otohime then turns into a turtle and the two are later revered as myojin deities.<br/><br/>To me, one of the important messages in this story is the importance of family and learning from past mistakes. So what sets my book apart is that I borrow elements from all these versions to create a wholesome ending where Urashima learns from his mistake of not treasuring the time he had with his family and uses it to treasure his remaining time with Otohime.I wanted to make Urashima grow stronger from his journey, instead of just mourning his losses.

Hola

México obtengo del estado una modesta pensión que no alcanza para vivir.
Tengo

Con su ayuda lograre establecer un precedente de que aun siendo anciano
tenemos mucho que aportar, enseñar y permitirá a otros ancianos a llevar a cabo
proyectos como el mío y tener una vejes con recursos suficientes para una vida
digna e independiente.
Lograre establecer una ruta para que muchos ancianos hagan sus proyectos
desde su casa y/o cama.
Necesito 2,000 dólares para pagar asesoría profesional que me ayude a
encontrar los puntos clave que no me han permitido lograrlo, con mis conocimientos

El lograr la independencia económica me llenara de total orgullo ya que
a mi edad soy productivo y útil para la sociedad contare mi historia para
invitar a abuelos a hacer lo mismo que yo. Siempre y hasta el último aliento se
puede.
 Si no logro los fondos suficientes sus aportaciones se habrán invertido
en conocimiento.
Su
aportación dará valor a los ancianos no seremos relegados porque ya no podemos.
Hacer lo que los jóvenes, pero si podemos ser con nuestra experiencia y conocimientos
altamente productivos.

La
persistencia y no aceptar que no puedo ser productivo a mi edad me da toda la
fuerza y el coraje para realizarlo, la sabiduría de los ancianos cimentó
maravillosos jóvenes. Voy a encontrar la forma de ser útil aunque mis
limitaciones por la edad para otros sean un obstáculo para mí son mi fortaleza.
Si no le es posible aportar fondos, por favor difunda mi campaña con expertos
en internet y con ancianos para que se enteren que hay formas de seguir
adelante. 
Se imaginan todo el conocimiento y experiencia acumulada en los ancianos
Vamos a darle valor.
Les pido de la manera más atenta que difundan mi campaña y que genere
eco en ancianos y nietos.

<p>My name is Derek and this is my funny albeit dangerously accurate look at women and their Zodiac.  Specifically how the stars aligning this way and that affect the way they conduct themselves in the bedroom and relationships.  </p>
<p>The book will be 30 to 40 pages long, features conceptual artwork, compelling writing that is funny and oddly true, comic strips and insights into each female zodiac.  </p>
<p><strong>Signs Say, She Might Be Bad:</strong> <strong>Women &amp; Their Zodiac or Whore-A-Scopes </strong>should be ready in December!  </p>
<p>So what is the book about?  It is about power and how it is wielded by women of various signs.  Women can take us there with class and grace or less subtly with a wink and rapid thrusting of her Popsicle into the inside of her cheek. </p>
<p>The book proposes what traits men are most desirous of and then correlates it to each woman’s astrological sign.  It is further deconstructed by comparing syncrisis. </p>
<p>I’ve used eight fundamental components and grouped them into four comparative groups:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">The first is she <strong>Modest</strong> versus <strong>Aggressive</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">Is she shy in the bedroom or does she bring a duffle bag to your first date filled enough special tools to put Batman to shame?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Second is she <strong>Chaste</strong> or <strong>Open</strong>…. Too everyone?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">For instance are you her first or her first Basketball Team?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Third we look at if she is <strong>Submissive</strong> or Dominant</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">Does she call you Sir and like collars or are you walking funny for the next month?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Lastly we compare and contrast how <strong>Demure</strong> she is versus <strong>Nymphomaniacal behavior</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Can you tell she hasn’t done this much or are you reaching for your wallet afterwards?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">These are finally aggregated into the Syncritic Lability Objectified Onerously &amp; Tenaciously Scale or SLOOT Scale for short.</p>
<p>As an aside there is no right or wrong side of the comparisons… some like it hot and some like it when a girl dons a gas mask and stomps on his testicles…  But wouldn’t it be great to know it before you were laying on the floor in a zipper mask hoping against hope that those stilletos heels she’s wearing are made from Nerf footballs?</p>
<p>The Point is, women can illicit fantasy from anywhere in the spectrum of innocence to profession.  Being a SLOOT isn’t just in Vogue, it is allowing all parties involved to gain some knowledge of what she is and isn’t capable of.</p>
<p>At its worst the book is funny, at its best it kicks the living shit out of Men are from Mars Women are from Venus.</p>

<p>Furthering this deep and practical science, I have close to 2,000 folks on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/horoscopes4nawtygirls/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> following (started on June 6th) the creation of this work and helping with content.   You can see each of the my Zodiac's and some of the writing associated with each sign <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/horoscopes4nawtygirls/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.  As for content, I am polling large communities on Facebook for keen insight.  I have about five polls I have collected... like this one - Which Sign is the Most Perverted:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499269421/fcylwruqakfle5w1acfw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have been working with different artists on conceptual drawings of the Zodiacs and different elements to include in the book.  I finally have sketches and stories for all twelve zodiacs (Need another $1,000 to finish all of them) from <a href=""http://www.artstation.com/artist/dartbaston"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facundo Moyano</a>.  </p>
<p>I want to include comic strips, polls and comparison charts.... but all this stuff costs more and more money.   As you can also tell by my haphazard writing style, my book will also require substantial editing  before publishing.</p>
<p>This is where you come in!!!</p>
<p>Sooooo <strong>What do You GET for your support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For $1 to $5</strong> you get to be dirty!  Or at least participate in something shy of pornography.  This is tongue and cheek or bump and grind depending on your proclivities and no insects were hurt in the making of this book (accept any living in trees that were felled to make the paper they will be printed on).  You get to have some fun, laugh a little and participate in something  completely unique.  You also get my admiration (which means literally nothing to your employer, family or clergy).  I will let the first 200 folks in this level follow the sign of their choosing as it evolves through the creative and publishing process.  I will need your email for this.. </p>
<p>I am working on a bumper stickers and other swag, but that comes with scale which comes with folks interest.  Any funds you submit can be later applied to swag as it comes out!</p>
<p><strong>Next Level is the Book which retails for $19 bucks. ON SALE till August 15th for $10 bucks!!!</strong>  I will run various specials as I get closer so keep an eye out.  The first 100 folks at this level will get a signed copy and a picture of me doing laundry reluctantly (soooo sexy!!).</p>
<p>Just to level set, a dude here wrote a book about Vice Presidents of the United States with octopuses on their heads and was fully funded (I was one of them, btw)... So don't act like my stuff is below you...</p>
<p><strong>For $35</strong> you get the book signed and a custom T-Shirt (scale is super important here, if 1 person gets a shirt it costs a butt load, but if 100 do it makes sense.  I will eat costs to make you happy!!)  of your favorite Zodiac with a compatibility matrix on the back.  These custom T-Shirts will increase your ice-breaking skills by 692% (It's Science).  There is also the possibility they spread joy like ebola in an oil wrestling match.</p>
<p><strong>For $45 </strong>you get the above plus a high resolution calendar with key celestial alignment for your sign and everyone else's that show the peak and valleys of the various signs during the year.   </p>
<p><strong>For $100</strong> you get mentioned in the forward and my junior prom picture, which is probably the most embarrassing thing I have ever looked at.  You also get a nod in the forward in the book and access to my other writing on Patreon.</p>

<h2><strong>INTRODUCCIÓN</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Siempre me ha gustado escribir.</i></p>
<p>Mi cuaderno favorito de primaria solía ser un cuaderno donde escribía mis canciones favoritas y pegaba recortes de frases y fotos de artistas. Con los años ese cuaderno se fue volviendo más personal, las fotos se volvieron mis dibujos, las canciones se volvieron rimas inspiradas en lo que veían mis ojos y las frases ya no salían de impresoras, si no que salían de mi corazón.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Escribir se volvió mi terapia.</i></p>
<p>Escribía por todo, y cuando las palabras no me salían por la boca, la pluma y el cuaderno se volvieron la puerta abierta a la cárcel que sentía que me aprisionaba por dentro.<br/>Luego empecé a leer poesía, y lo que escribía empezaba a adoptar melodías y un tono tan honesto que al releerlo ni yo misma podía creer que había sido yo quien había escrito eso.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Así nació Cafeína y Nicotina,</i></p>
<p>de un día que decidí leer todas las frases que habían alguna vez sido la cura de mi insomnio de madrugadas, la calma del caos que llevaba por dentro en las mañanas, y tardes de refugio con forma de páginas de cuaderno.</p>
<p>Este libro no es solo un poemario, es mi diario, un pedacito de mi corazón entregado en tus manos, mi alma desnuda para que la lleves de llavero cuando quieras, y me leas..</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524503209/uhzrppaqsopaoarffd8s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>¿Quien es G. A. Picota?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>G. A. Picota, Gabriela Picota, Gigi, Gaby, QueenGG, G. A. Poesía, díganme como ustedes quieran.</i></p>
<p>Actriz, bailarina, aveces pintora y oficialmente escritora. Nací el 7 de agosto de 1995, fui a la escuela, intenté ir a la universidad, he cometido errores, me he enamorado, he roto corazones, tengo sueños y deseos (entre ellos que mi libro esté entre tus manos) y siento tanto como tú. Hace dos años, luego de leer mis escritos y darme cuenta que había potencial en ellos, decidí traspasarlos en blanco y solos se convirtieron en un poemario. Cafeína y Nicotina es el primer libro que me atrevo a publicar y el primero de una colección de tres poemarios, y el libro que me va a debutar como escritora oficial.</p>
<h2>¿Qué es la Campaña Cafeína y Nicotina?</h2>
<p>Más que una campaña de recolecta de dinero y donación es realmente más como una preventa única del libro, sólo que con <strong>beneficios y recompensas</strong> <strong>exclusivas</strong> para las personas que apoyen la campaña Cafeína y Nicotina.</p>
<h3>¿Qué Beneficio y Recompensa Exclusiva me gano si apoyo a la Campaña?</h3>
<p>Depende de como apoyes. La Campaña Cafeína y Nicotina te ofrece 5 paquetes únicos para que puedas apoyar. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Paquete Consumidor</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Paquete Enviciado</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Paquete Adicto</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Paquete Cafeína&amp;NicotinaBox</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Paquete VIP</p>
<p>Cada paquete ofrece una serie de beneficios y recompensas diferentes dependiendo del aporte que hagas. </p>
<p><i>¡Si quieres saber el valor de cada paquete y sus gajes, en el cuadro a la derecha sale toda la información necesaria sobre las recompensas, entregas, precios y más!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524503416/vyqwfe1nvswed8yzoxw0.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<h3>¿Para qué es la Meta?</h3>
<p>La meta de los $2110.00 cubre los gastos de impresión del libro, edición, registros y legales, diseño y transportación. Una vez hayamos llegado a la meta, el libro va a poder ser impreso, publicado y transportado a las tiendas y librerías del país o a sus mismísimas manos si colaboran con la campaña. </p>
<p><u><i>Importante: la meta es únicamente para cubrir gastos de producción y post-producción del libro, las ganancias de la autora con esta campaña es únicamente lograr que su libro llegue a librerías y a sus manos</i></u>.</p>
<h3>¿Qué Pasa si no llegamos a la Meta?</h3>
<p><i>Si no llegamos a la meta, no habrá publicación de Cafeína y Nicotina.</i></p>
<p>Esta campaña es a <strong>TODO O NADA</strong>, si llegamos a la meta, cada una de las personas que apoyo con la campaña se llevaran su recompensa tal cual está especificada y podremos imprimir el libro para distribuir en todas las librerías y tiendas del país...</p>
<p><strong><i>Pero si no llegamos...</i></strong></p>
<p>Todo el dinero recaudado se le devolverá a las personas que apoyaron a la Campaña, no habrán recompensas y por ende, no podremos publicar el libro ni distribuirlo.</p>
<p>Por eso es muy importante que compartas la campaña y alientes a tus amigos a que apoyen. ¡Solo con compartir la página atraerás a más personas que pueden estar interesadas en apoyar a la campaña y ayudarás a que lleguemos a la meta!</p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCCIÓN
Siempre me ha gustado escribir.
Mi cuaderno favorito de primaria solía ser un cuaderno donde escribía mis canciones favoritas y pegaba recortes de frases y fotos de artistas. Con los años ese cuaderno se fue volviendo más personal, las fotos se volvieron mis dibujos, las canciones se volvieron rimas inspiradas en lo que veían mis ojos y las frases ya no salían de impresoras, si no que salían de mi corazón.
Escribir se volvió mi terapia.
Escribía por todo, y cuando las palabras no me salían por la boca, la pluma y el cuaderno se volvieron la puerta abierta a la cárcel que sentía que me aprisionaba por dentro.Luego empecé a leer poesía, y lo que escribía empezaba a adoptar melodías y un tono tan honesto que al releerlo ni yo misma podía creer que había sido yo quien había escrito eso.
Así nació Cafeína y Nicotina,
de un día que decidí leer todas las frases que habían alguna vez sido la cura de mi insomnio de madrugadas, la calma del caos que llevaba por dentro en las mañanas, y tardes de refugio con forma de páginas de cuaderno.
Este libro no es solo un poemario, es mi diario, un pedacito de mi corazón entregado en tus manos, mi alma desnuda para que la lleves de llavero cuando quieras, y me leas..

¿Quien es G. A. Picota?
G. A. Picota, Gabriela Picota, Gigi, Gaby, QueenGG, G. A. Poesía, díganme como ustedes quieran.
Actriz, bailarina, aveces pintora y oficialmente escritora. Nací el 7 de agosto de 1995, fui a la escuela, intenté ir a la universidad, he cometido errores, me he enamorado, he roto corazones, tengo sueños y deseos (entre ellos que mi libro esté entre tus manos) y siento tanto como tú. Hace dos años, luego de leer mis escritos y darme cuenta que había potencial en ellos, decidí traspasarlos en blanco y solos se convirtieron en un poemario. Cafeína y Nicotina es el primer libro que me atrevo a publicar y el primero de una colección de tres poemarios, y el libro que me va a debutar como escritora oficial.
¿Qué es la Campaña Cafeína y Nicotina?
Más que una campaña de recolecta de dinero y donación es realmente más como una preventa única del libro, sólo que con beneficios y recompensas exclusivas para las personas que apoyen la campaña Cafeína y Nicotina.
¿Qué Beneficio y Recompensa Exclusiva me gano si apoyo a la Campaña?
Depende de como apoyes. La Campaña Cafeína y Nicotina te ofrece 5 paquetes únicos para que puedas apoyar. 
Paquete Consumidor

Paquete Adicto
Paquete Cafeína&NicotinaBox
Paquete VIP
Cada paquete ofrece una serie de beneficios y recompensas diferentes dependiendo del aporte que hagas. 
¡Si quieres saber el valor de cada paquete y sus gajes, en el cuadro a la derecha sale toda la información necesaria sobre las recompensas, entregas, precios y más!

¿Para qué es la Meta?
La meta de los $2110.00 cubre los gastos de impresión del libro, edición, registros y legales, diseño y transportación. Una vez hayamos llegado a la meta, el libro va a poder ser impreso, publicado y transportado a las tiendas y librerías del país o a sus mismísimas manos si colaboran con la campaña. 
Importante: la meta es únicamente para cubrir gastos de producción y post-producción del libro, las ganancias de la autora con esta campaña es únicamente lograr que su libro llegue a librerías y a sus manos.
¿Qué Pasa si no llegamos a la Meta?
Si no llegamos a la meta, no habrá publicación de Cafeína y Nicotina.
Esta campaña es a TODO O NADA, si llegamos a la meta, cada una de las personas que apoyo con la campaña se llevaran su recompensa tal cual está especificada y podremos imprimir el libro para distribuir en todas las librerías y tiendas del país...
Pero si no llegamos...
Todo el dinero recaudado se le devolverá a las personas que apoyaron a la Campaña, no habrán recompensas y por ende, no podremos publicar el libro ni distribuirlo.
Por eso es muy importante que compartas la campaña y alientes a tus amigos a que apoyen. ¡Solo con compartir la página atraerás a más personas que pueden estar interesadas en apoyar a la campaña y ayudarás a que lleguemos a la meta!

<h3>How science works...</h3>
<p>Every year roughly 2.5 million scientific articles are published by an estimated 7.8 million researchers<a href=""https://www.elsevier.com/connect/elsevier-publishing-a-look-at-the-numbers-and-more"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><sup>1</sup></a>.  Now think back to 2017... How many scientific publications did you read? And how often did you read about scientific breakthroughs in popular media? Truth be told, unless you are an active researcher that needs to stay abreast of the latest developments in your field, scientific publications are boring.  Heck, even scientists find most articles boring.  They'll never admit to it, but it is true. Yet this is how science works.  You do sciency things, write it as short as possible without losing too much detail and then rewrite the article a couple of times to please a handful of your peers.  When everybody is happy, you pay the journal a large sum of money to publish the article for you, and then you start hoping that someone else cites your work in theirs. </p>

<p>Scientists are the investigators of truth in our world, however, few actually get the chance to communicate their results outside of the scientific realm.  We want to change that, by giving scientists a platform to disseminate their results directly to the general public.  After publication in an accredited journal, the scientist then rewrites their article for our audience.  Using our search algorithms, anyone can find articles on their subject of interest, written in easy to understand English, with links to the original scholarly articles.  We encourage the use of analogies to explain complex concepts.  Take the Higgs boson, also known as the god-particle.  The discovery made major headlines, and people were up in arms about its discovery.  But could you explain what the Higgs boson means in our everyday life?   We ran a story on the possible discovery of a anti-matter counterpart of the Higgs boson predicted by a group of South African researchers, and explained the Higgs boson as follow:</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><font color=""blue""><i>""Various analogies exist to explain the Higgs boson, however, we would like to compare it to a body of water, such as a dam or lake, which is filled with drops of water. Each waterdrop can be seen as a Higgs-boson, which together forms a Higgs-field, or in our case a lake. On this lake, various water-sports are practised. Birds are flying over the dam, while a couple are gliding in a canoe. A man is busy swimming, and a woman is running into the water. Each individual explains how different particles interact with the Higgs-field. Photons, the particles that make up light, does not interact with the field at all, and as the birds, they just pass by. The canoe gliding smootly on the water encounters very little resistance from the water, just as electrons do in the Higgs-field. The man swimming encounters more resistance and needs more energy than the gliding canoe, just as the quarks that make up protons and neutrons. The woman running in the water encounters the most resistance, as does W and Z bosons. In this case, the “resistance” encountered equals the mass of the particle, the more “resistance” the more mass the particle has.""</i></font></p>
<p>Even the most complex theories can be explained as easy to understand analogies.  Furthermore, by understanding the latest scientific discoveries, as reported by the scientist themselves, our society can start to question anything and everything, and find answers for themselves. This, in turn, will result in increased numbers of citizen scientists, knowledgeable and up to date with scientific facts.  Plus, just think how awesome it would be to say ""I've recently read a scientific, peer-reviewed paper about that"" the next time you meet a climate change denialist-, anti-vax-, flat-earther avocado-junkie. </p>
<p>Our thirst for knowledge is what makes us human.  Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson is arguably one of the most famous living scientists, and although he's a regular on lots of TV shows and news bulletins, he is also a prolific academic writer.  He sums up the importance of our search for truth in this video:</p>

<h3>But what is in it for the scientist?</h3>
<p>Scientists have a lot on their to-do lists.  They need to apply for research funding, develop methods, publish their findings, develop and train other scientists and try to have a normal social life as well.  Being scientists ourselves (two of our team are currently completing PhDs), we understand the burden placed upon researchers, be it in academia or in the private sector. That is why we developed a business model which would make most business analysts (including our Financial Officer) cringe.  Based on the number of times an article is read or shared on Facebook and Twitter, we will distribute 60% of all advertising revenue generated back to researchers.   As our financial position gets better, we'll increase this up to the point where all income generated by adds are paid back to the scientists. We created this business model to give back to the scientific community for all the hard work done.  These funds will be made available to scientists as vouchers for the open access publishing of their future research.  By paying for open access publishing, we will be creating a society where science is open, responsible and to the benefit of everyone.</p>

</div></div>","How science works...
Every year roughly 2.5 million scientific articles are published by an estimated 7.8 million researchers1.  Now think back to 2017... How many scientific publications did you read? And how often did you read about scientific breakthroughs in popular media? Truth be told, unless you are an active researcher that needs to stay abreast of the latest developments in your field, scientific publications are boring.  Heck, even scientists find most articles boring.  They'll never admit to it, but it is true. Yet this is how science works.  You do sciency things, write it as short as possible without losing too much detail and then rewrite the article a couple of times to please a handful of your peers.  When everybody is happy, you pay the journal a large sum of money to publish the article for you, and then you start hoping that someone else cites your work in theirs. 

There exists a need for scientists to communicate...
Scientists are the investigators of truth in our world, however, few actually get the chance to communicate their results outside of the scientific realm.  We want to change that, by giving scientists a platform to disseminate their results directly to the general public.  After publication in an accredited journal, the scientist then rewrites their article for our audience.  Using our search algorithms, anyone can find articles on their subject of interest, written in easy to understand English, with links to the original scholarly articles.  We encourage the use of analogies to explain complex concepts.  Take the Higgs boson, also known as the god-particle.  The discovery made major headlines, and people were up in arms about its discovery.  But could you explain what the Higgs boson means in our everyday life?   We ran a story on the possible discovery of a anti-matter counterpart of the Higgs boson predicted by a group of South African researchers, and explained the Higgs boson as follow:

<h3>Long and the short of it...</h3>
<p>Hi Everyone,<br/>My name is <strong>Stephen Piccone</strong>, a Boston-based Poet and Writer. To my more-than-generous Social Media following, I'm known as <strong>Spwrites</strong>. As a child of the 80's Metal-Generation, I gained a love for poetry through my passion for music and songwriting. It always felt natural. And through events in my life, some good and bad, my ability for Poetry has come out with a force. </p>
<p><i>Still with me? Good :)</i><br/><br/>I'm launching this campaign to help fund my first book, <i>""The Book of Sorrowful Lies.""</i>  I feel it's important to everyone to have a great sense of self-accomplishment. I get true accomplishment when my words reach so many people around the world through Social Media, and the strangers I inspire. Now I want to join the ranks of 'published' Writers. Which is where you, the contributor comes in.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>Money! :) Even though there are many free services, which are fantastic, I'm choosing to go through a print house that specializes as the all-in-one deal, bookbaby.com. I will be asking for $3000.00 <i><strong>*(I honestly never knew how expensive it was to print a book. <u>Especially </u>Hardcover)</strong></i>  to fund the initial run which cover everything from the cover design, formatting, printing, editing, marketing and everything else I'm forgetting at the moment. Every book on the initial run will be an 'Author's Copy' and will be shipped by my personally since it's my intention to sign every one. Otherwise, everything beyond this campaign, the print house takes care of shipping. Which is good because my closet of an apartment doesn't have a lot of room.</p>
<p>I have alot of fantastic gifts to offer.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Soft and Hardcovers all signed, and shipped by me.</i></li>
<li><i>5x7 Print Cards, also signed.</i></li>
<li><i>Thank you shout by name in the final video to all donors.</i></li>
<li><i>Skype Call.  </i></li>
</ul>
<p>And...for the higher-tier donors....</p>
<ul>
<li>The original, handwritten pages for the construction of this book. These are true one-of-a-kind and not copies.They also have notes that have led to the creation of other works not in this book. My handwriting is unique and isn't learned by the children of today, sadly.        </li>
<li>
<i><strong>*</strong></i><u><i><strong>Note, I still retain all creative rights to all words on the original pages.</strong></i></u>                                                            </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>Books today seem to be fewer all the time. On a personal level, and even though this will be released in digital, I feel it's important for the tangible and physical to remain important. Nothing can ever replace the feel, or smell of an actual book. <br/>I never thought I would ever get to this point. And when I hit <strong><i><u>5,000 </u></i></strong>followers, I started to think,<i> ""Can I really pull this off?""  W</i>hen I hit almost <u><i><strong>30,000</strong></i></u> in a little over two-years,<i> </i>The answer was a resounding, '<i>absolutely.'</i><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Rewards...</h3>
<p>As this is going to be a fixed-funding, and the printing depends on this campaign succeeding, It's an all-or nothing deal. This is a gamble. But I'm confident in my fans and my Social Media presence.</p>
</div><div>
<p><i>Are you still here? Good :)</i></p>
<p>So if you've read this far, I hope you'll consider donating to my campaign. I don't intend to print any of these works in another volume. So every copy bought will be unique. Thank you so very much!<br/><br/>And if you can't, I <i><strong><u>love you</u></strong></i> just the same.<br/>I would so appreciate it if you would share this across your social media's :) TELL YOUR FRIENDS! :)<br/><br/><i>""And what should happen if we exceed funding?""</i> </p>
<p>I'm glad you asked; ALL proceeds will be put towards my second book, and what I hope will be my first Novel. No, I won't spoil the surprise. It's a character who is my alter-ego and something I've been creating and refining in one facet or another for the last 30 years. I wouldn't be surprised if it was optioned for a screenplay. But first things first...</p>

<p>Many months later I was emailed by a resident of the area. I told my Father and he was hesitant, but finally began a conversation with G. DeMarco. He connected my Dad to Linda Moulton Howe. My Father had two very long phone conversations with Linda. She aired his story on Coast to Coast AM.</p>
<p>After the interview he began to recall a lot more of his encounter. I found 2 huge boxes of his paintings and sketches in my garage. They were taped up and stored high on a shelf by my Father decades ago. Some of the art and sculptures have a bearing on his experience that will be noticed as I tell his full updated story.</p>
<p>I need to build a full blown web site with dozens of images he painted and sculpted. I work full time and can only devote part time to the project. I must hire out much of the web site work such as:  Reviewing and typing from my hundreds of pages of notes. Sizing and preparing his paintings and sketches to show on the site and offering copies for sale. It took me a month just to get this far. I fear I will not complete his full story by myself. All those that contribute funds will be offered discounts on copies of the limited editions of his art and a peek at how it is progressing.<br/><br/>My Father describes the incident, ""It was very unusual to see clouds so close to the ground, so small in size and so well defined. They remained in front of me for sometime. The small dark oval clouds were about 400 feet away and appeared to be covering solid images. They were moving slowly up and down behind the trees. I estimated them to be about 20 feet in size and oval shaped.""<br/><br/>""Something in the reservoir water to my right was making an audible rumbling sound and my car was vibrating. I looked and did not see anything in or near the water that was making the sound. I then turned my head straight ahead and was looking thru the windshield at the two small clouds that were slowly beginning to reveal what they were concealing. The continuous fast beeping transmissions on my car's am radio continued. After a few minutes something made a rustling sound in the woods to my left. I could feel the hair on my arm rise straight up. I felt a paralysis over my body. I originally thought out of intense fear that I did not turn my head to my left to look. My car was between that sound and the reservoir water where the rumbling noise was coming from. For many years my mind went blank when I tried to recall that moment up to the time I sped away.

<p>Noemi created her first zine more than 18 years ago</p>
<p>Hi my name is Noemi and I'm a poet and creative from South Texas. My borderlands tongue story begins centuries ago in Puerto Rico and Mexico  and more recently, how my parents met in Chicago. </p>
<p>My dad came to the US as a bracero and was used for his labor. My mom and her family were displaced from Puerto Rico when she was very young.  After living in Chicago we moved to South Texas where the idea of being split biculturally and triculturally was even more pronounced.</p>
<p>I came to zines when I was about 20 and wrote my first zine ""Making of a Chicana."" Influenced by young punk women of color at the time who were making zines, I wanted to document my experience as a young brown crip mother in a little place called the Rio Grande Valley as I dealt with being a single parent, poverty, working/working poor, chronically ill,  depression/anxiety and all the feelings in between. </p>
<p>This zine anthology includes the work I have done since then, beginning with ""Making of a Chicana""  in 2001, the first issue of hermana resist from 2002 as well as other one offs and mini zines I did. </p>
<p><strong>-Including in this anthology:</strong></p>
<p> Hermana, Resist 1-5</p>
<p>-Aged Noise</p>
<p>-Making of a Chicana</p>
<p>-Lines from Acedia to Apatheia</p>
<p>-The blue metal kettle</p>
<p><strong>What's inside this 8x10"" collection: </strong></p>
<p>200 + pages filled with zines I've written in the last two decades. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Funding</strong></p>
<p>The funding of this project will go directly to pay printing costs and other associated fees for a first print run. It will also go towards promotional materials and shipping fees. </p>
<p>Anything above this amount will go towards travel fees and tabling. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Documenting our existence and history is vital and so many queer crip women and nonbinary zinesters and writers work is lost because it is not archived. </p>
<p>The reality is that many presses don't want to take on a zine anthology project because of the cost and size. Many also believe that since zines are a dying lo-fi product, zine anthologies won't sell and won't have traction. Another reality is that collections by women of color and nonbinary zinesters of color just do not get produced. Documenting the existence of our work from decades past is vital to portraying a part of history that we were part of, and a testament that this medium of communication was important for us latinx, grrls, punks, and others trying to find our voice, and each other. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many zines of decades ago vanish without being preserved. The flats are lost or their makers are no longer with us. I strongly believe, and have advocated for ever, that it's necessary to preserve our work both because it's culturally significant and because we are often missing from zine history and history itself. Writing and producing zines is one way of documenting our existence and writing our own history, but so is preserving these written histories. </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are challenges with this getting accepted at traditional indie presses. This is a large collection and comes in at about 200 pages, and after having shopped it around to different presses set a goal to get this printed and ready in 2018. </p>

<p>I'm Kobina, a Ghanaian dad to two rambunctious boys (2 and 7 ) born and raised in the UK. My kids and I love reading, but I quickly found that there weren’t enough books or resources that represented our roots.</p> <p>That's why I write – for young readers who have yet to see themselves represented in a children’s book, and for inquiring world explorers who are ready to discover new worlds and cultures!</p> <p>My call to action came when my son began to ask questions about his identity. He was asking why he was different and, with nothing in the marketplace that represented him, I sprang into action and self-published my first children's book. There are no words to describe the look of excitement and amazement I saw in his eyes when he held the first book in his hands. It made all the late nights and hard work worth it.</p> <p>I realized that day, that I want other Ghanaian children to have that same look in their eyes when they pick up a book. Every child deserves that at least once.</p> <p>This book is one small step closer to adding more representation to the world of children’s literature.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>ONLY 29% </strong>of all children's books feature main BIPOC characters. There are more books about animals than there are about ALL BIPOC combined!</p> <p>Only <strong>11.9% </strong>of children's books in 2019 had Black or African characters, according to We Need Diverse Books.</p> <p>In today's multicultural and diverse world, we believe that is <strong>simply not good enough!</strong></p> <p><strong>Promoting tolerance </strong>requires engaging with ideas, people and cultures that you might not be familiar with and picture books are a powerful way to do that.</p>
<p>With your support, we will be one step closer to creating an inclusive culture among the next generation.</p> <p><strong>You get to make a difference twice!</strong> Your support diversifies bookshelves across the globe AND allows us the funds to print an accessibly priced special edition for Ghanaian children!</p>

<p>Kobina is a Ghanaian father with a vivid imagination. This is his second self-published book. The first self-published title - Rambunctious Kwame is still selling well. Kobina also has a number of traditional children’s book contracts in development with major publishers. He understands self-publishing and has established contacts within the book industry.</p> <p>Kobina has had a love of reading since he was a young boy and now his kids share that same love. His passion for writing was born out of a desire for his kids and others to have a connection to their home continent, see characters that look like them, and read about experiences they can connect with. It‛s also for other kids to experience how other cultures live, their food, and language, whilst showing that after all, we are all alike in our hopes, dreams, and aspirations.</p> <p>Kobina is also a co-founder of two initiatives working to increase Black representation in publishing. The first is BlackCreatorsInKidLit, a ground-roots organization focused on improving the craft of Black creatives and providing opportunities and the second is Haberman+Nerds Press, a wholly African owned publisher focused on finding African creatives with potential and nurturing them to compete on the world stage.</p> <p>When Kobina is not writing, he's working as a Software Engineering Manager at a financial company.</p> <p>Find out more about Kobina <a href=""https://www.booksbybernardkmensah.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>As a child, she was obsessed with reading and would always choose books that invited her in with an exciting book jacket or beautiful illustrations.  Lisa has a vivid imagination and has, for as long as she can remember, used this to write her own stories and illustrate them. As soon as she was able, Lisa picked up a pencil and began to draw and she’s hardly put one down since. She would spend hours as a child creating artworks and was actually probably a pretty annoying kid as when asked what she wanted to do the answer would always be ‘colouring in’.</p>
<p>This love for visual storytelling carried right through Lisa’s education to Loughborough University where she studied for her degree in Illustration with animation. Since graduating she has become a published illustrator. Lisa has also been a children's teacher for 9 years.</p>

You and your child can add another language to your belt! Here are some sneak peeks of the illustrations!

I'm Kobina, a Ghanaian dad to two rambunctious boys (2 and 7 ) born and raised in the UK. My kids and I love reading, but I quickly found that there weren’t enough books or resources that represented our roots. That's why I write – for young readers who have yet to see themselves represented in a children’s book, and for inquiring world explorers who are ready to discover new worlds and cultures! My call to action came when my son began to ask questions about his identity. He was asking why he was different and, with nothing in the marketplace that represented him, I sprang into action and self-published my first children's book. There are no words to describe the look of excitement and amazement I saw in his eyes when he held the first book in his hands. It made all the late nights and hard work worth it. I realized that day, that I want other Ghanaian children to have that same look in their eyes when they pick up a book. Every child deserves that at least once. This book is one small step closer to adding more representation to the world of children’s literature.
 

 
ONLY 29% of all children's books feature main BIPOC characters. There are more books about animals than there are about ALL BIPOC combined! Only 11.9% of children's books in 2019 had Black or African characters, according to We Need Diverse Books. In today's multicultural and diverse world, we believe that is simply not good enough! Promoting tolerance requires engaging with ideas, people and cultures that you might not be familiar with and picture books are a powerful way to do that.
With your support, we will be one step closer to creating an inclusive culture among the next generation. You get to make a difference twice! Your support diversifies bookshelves across the globe AND allows us the funds to print an accessibly priced special edition for Ghanaian children!
 


 


 
Kobina is a Ghanaian father with a vivid imagination. This is his second self-published book. The first self-published title - Rambunctious Kwame is still selling well. Kobina also has a number of traditional children’s book contracts in development with major publishers. He understands self-publishing and has established contacts within the book industry. Kobina has had a love of reading since he was a young boy and now his kids share that same love. His passion for writing was born out of a desire for his kids and others to have a connection to their home continent, see characters that look like them, and read about experiences they can connect with. It‛s also for other kids to experience how other cultures live, their food, and language, whilst showing that after all, we are all alike in our hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Kobina is also a co-founder of two initiatives working to increase Black representation in publishing. The first is BlackCreatorsInKidLit, a ground-roots organization focused on improving the craft of Black creatives and providing opportunities and the second is Haberman+Nerds Press, a wholly African owned publisher focused on finding African creatives with potential and nurturing them to compete on the world stage. When Kobina is not writing, he's working as a Software Engineering Manager at a financial company. Find out more about Kobina here


 

 
As a child, she was obsessed with reading and would always choose books that invited her in with an exciting book jacket or beautiful illustrations.  Lisa has a vivid imagination and has, for as long as she can remember, used this to write her own stories and illustrate them. As soon as she was able, Lisa picked up a pencil and began to draw and she’s hardly put one down since. She would spend hours as a child creating artworks and was actually probably a pretty annoying kid as when asked what she wanted to do the answer would always be ‘colouring in’.
This love for visual storytelling carried right through Lisa’s education to Loughborough University where she studied for her degree in Illustration with animation. Since graduating she has become a published illustrator. Lisa has also been a children's teacher for 9 years.

<p>Well, I'm going to take that a step further, and also make it much less expensive than the $6.99 or so that I slapped down every month to get Mr. King's fine serial. I think that by the time the sixth installment was released, I must have payed over $40 for the whole book.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">From the lips of the creator, ""<i>Last weekend I spent 2 nights in the hospital with my little one as he battled a lung infection; I was graced to meet a teen who was on admission - this was her second failed attempt at excessive self-harm. She'd had a go at self-harm twice in two weeks and almost died in both cases. Her's is a story of acceptance, relevance and a lack of self-love. This encounter re-emphasised once again the reality of the world in which our teen girls find themselves - <strong>there is a constant daily and periodic battle in their minds; a fierce battle for acceptance, love, relevance, perfection and self-love</strong>!</i> </p>
<p>OWN IT! is timely in that there is a growing movement in the Western world and abroad for real, substantive content that helps empower young women. Readers crave information that speaks to their heart and the heart of our society. OWN IT! is a beautiful marriage of inspiring content, clever design, and witty insight. This 2-in-1 book explores the vast landscape of emotions that adolescent girls experience – from tragedy and despair to joy, elatement and self-love. Though it touches on the hardships and mental blocks that many young women face, it more importantly provides a heartfelt look at the other side, the light at the end of the tunnel. This approach was carefully chosen in order to help reduce the allure of loneliness, self-hate, suicide attempts, suicides and self-harm so many adolescent girls experience. </p>
<p>The purpose of this book series is to help revolutionise young female identity and watch as it impacts the wider world; and to continue the trend of empowerment and strength that our girls are feeling. It is my sincere hope that this project will inspire more people to join in the effort to bring dignity and hope to the life of young women across the globe.""</p>

<p>We went out to teen girls across 11 ethnicities and we collected anonymous data on how they genuinely feel about themselves; we came away with more insight than we bargained for. Below you'll find some of the discoveries we came across;</p>

<p>Understanding these statistics underscores the importance of this campaign. A great number of teenage girls feel awful about their bodies, image, character and more. What you see on the outside is a girl who '<i>seems happy and fulfilled</i>', but many teenage girls tell us this is so - they do not love themselves! Guess what, this trend was same across the 11 ethnicities we surveyed. <strong>It is a global trend.</strong></p>
<p>We want to help teen girls learn more about themselves, their mind, their actions and their daily responsibility. We believe that spelling this out in a book is more beneficial and will act as a reference point for them. By contributing to this campaign you will help make this happen for no fewer than 600 teenage girls.</p>

<p>Two books have been combined to create OWN IT! One half is a book of success and empowering explanatory quotes, the second half is a book of mental and emotional challenges, including ideas and a workbook that'll help the young female intentionally  access where she is at presently, where she'd love to be in the near future and how to get there. More importantly, because too many words spoil the pie or get avoided by teenagers, we decided to '<strong>SPEAK UP</strong>' in multidimensional life quotes for girls and to girls who feel powerless, un-loved and ridden with the guilt of their past - we want to make them understand that every stage in life is but a stage and they can absolutely OWN each stage. </p>

Readers crave information that speaks to their heart and the heart of our society. OWN IT! is a beautiful marriage of inspiring content, clever design, and witty insight. This 2-in-1 book explores the vast landscape of emotions that adolescent girls experience – from tragedy and despair to joy, elatement and self-love. Though it touches on the hardships and mental blocks that many young women face, it more importantly provides a heartfelt look at the other side, the light at the end of the tunnel. This approach was carefully chosen in order to help reduce the allure of loneliness, self-hate, suicide attempts, suicides and self-harm so many adolescent girls experience. 
The purpose of this book series is to help revolutionise young female identity and watch as it impacts the wider world; and to continue the trend of empowerment and strength that our girls are feeling. It is my sincere hope that this project will inspire more people to join in the effort to bring dignity and hope to the life of young women across the globe.""
We want to publish our first 600 copies.
Accompanying each Early Bird Special copy of the book will be a beautifully illustrated and well crafted DIGITAL daily Resolution Planner.

We went out to teen girls across 11 ethnicities and we collected anonymous data on how they genuinely feel about themselves; we came away with more insight than we bargained for. Below you'll find some of the discoveries we came across;
 

 
..... And they also kindly shared their inner thoughts with us;


Understanding these statistics underscores the importance of this campaign. A great number of teenage girls feel awful about their bodies, image, character and more. What you see on the outside is a girl who 'seems happy and fulfilled', but many teenage girls tell us this is so - they do not love themselves! Guess what, this trend was same across the 11 ethnicities we surveyed. It is a global trend.
We want to help teen girls learn more about themselves, their mind, their actions and their daily responsibility. We believe that spelling this out in a book is more beneficial and will act as a reference point for them. By contributing to this campaign you will help make this happen for no fewer than 600 teenage girls.

 

This is specifically made for girls age 12-19 years.
Only Teenage girls?
No. Specifically for teen girls, but suitable for pre-teens and young adults.
 

Two books have been combined to create OWN IT! One half is a book of success and empowering explanatory quotes, the second half is a book of mental and emotional challenges, including ideas and a workbook that'll help the young female intentionally  access where she is at presently, where she'd love to be in the near future and how to get there. More importantly, because too many words spoil the pie or get avoided by teenagers, we decided to 'SPEAK UP' in multidimensional life quotes for girls and to girls who feel powerless, un-loved and ridden with the guilt of their past - we want to make them understand that every stage in life is but a stage and they can absolutely OWN each stage. 
All quotes are original and from the heart strings of the Bold Girl laboratory (not a real lab, more like a think-tank space:)

OWN IT! has 60+ multidimensional and explanatory life quotes, emotional and mental scenario challenges plus ideas, and a workbook designed to inform, empower, and motivate girls to take action and OWN their everyday journey in life. Some of the topics covered are;



... including topics on Your Body, Legacy, Foresight, People skills and lots more.


 
 

The money raised from this campaign will enable us to finish and deliver this beautifully illustrated hardcover book to at least 600 girls around the world. The initial funding goal of £8,500 (US$11,800) will help to fund: 

within the timescales below;

Before we send the book to print, we plan to invite teen group subject matter experts, and a few on the ground experts to review the book's content, to ensure fairness and precision of impact. We also are considering using one of the best printing companies in the world (in North America) to produce our book.

Early Bird Specials come with a free downloadable digital OWN IT! Resolution Planner;

Also, as part of the Early Bird Special, we will pay a fraction of the delivery cost - saving you more money!

Combining our strengths together is our little way  of contributing to a greater and better society and world. 
 
Risks & Challenges
This is a low risk project.
While the book is 75% finished, we have worked hard to structure the book's content management; we are collaborating closely with our illustrators, and the full delivery of all illustrations will be complete by the second week in January 2018. We will invite subject matter experts to review the content to make sure that the content and the precision of impact is as should be.
We will do everything we can to meet the timeline. In case of any problems and delays, we will make sure to inform you as soon as they arise.

<h3><i><strong><u>THE STORY</u></strong></i></h3>
<p>Psych City is not what it seems.</p>
<p>Corporations run the city, controlling its citizens through subliminal messages and colour manipulation.</p>
<p>but only a few people are immune to it.</p>
<p>Jay believes that everything is normal as he lives his life. But it isn't until he meets a stranger that he is shown the true side of the city that not only changes his life, but everyone within the city.</p>
<p>When Jay is introduced to people who share his spirit they can help and guide him through his new found knowledge, but the only knowledge they are missing is How and Why as they continue their pursuit for the truth. </p>
<p>With the Insights now carrying another pursuer, their questions are almost answered but their investigation only leads them with more work to do.</p>
<p>Only until the truth is finally revealed do they discover that they are actually protecting them. But that's far from the beginning!</p>
<p>The truth is dangerous, but is far from what they expected. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><u><i><strong>JAMIE HASWELL </strong></i></u></h3>
<p>It has taken a whole two years to complete this novel, in which the time has allowed me to prepare for over 200 more ideas, prepared to place on paper and release into the world so you can read it. </p>
<p>My passion is to write but my passion is also to provide people with not just a story, but a <strong>dimension</strong>, a change. </p>
<p>Books in our modern world have tended to follow a strict and<i> narrow</i> line which only includes a story and in my honest opinion, i have found that they tend to be repetitive where every book i read is exactly the same as the<strong> next book on the shelf. </strong></p>
<p><i><strong>This upsets me</strong>! </i></p>
<p>I love to write about new things -<strong>MY IMAGINATION</strong>- I love to create new worlds, exciting worlds, new creatures. I like to write about the<u> IMPOSSIBLE!</u></p>
<p>A book is not supposed to be something logical. Unless you're reading the <i>dictionary</i> then a book is supposed to be fun, gripping and should not end when you finish it, but ask <strong><u>you</u></strong> to create and <strong><i>wonder</i>!</strong></p>

<h3><u><i><strong>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</strong></i></u></h3>
<p>For the two years in which i wrote, i could not help but think about people reading my book.</p>
<p>Whether I was on my daily commute, i would watch the people who sat on the train, immersed in their pages, the slight mimic their lips made as they read the words their characters spoke within their books as if they were the character themselves. </p>
<p>To see someone reading Psych City on the train. To see someone move their lips as they sat with their eyes locked onto the page, speaking as the character. To see someones life shift, from commuting to work at 7am in the morning, not knowing if they would get home in time to see the sun. Not knowing if they would get to see their children before they hurried into bed that night. To see their life propel into Psych City, to live with Jay as he searched, to explore the colour littered city as the reader alternated into the <u><strong>dimension</strong></u> of Psych City. This would make the 2 years of my life that i poured passion onto pages<i><u><strong> </strong></u></i><u><strong>a dream</strong></u>. </p>
<p>To me <u><strong>YOU</strong></u> are <strong>important</strong>.<u><i> I want to make you smile</i></u>. <strong>I want you to be immersed by<i> <u>Psych City!  </u></i></strong></p>

<h3><strong><u><i>YOUR CONTRIBUTION </i></u></strong></h3>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to raise the word of Psych City.</p>
<p>My passion is writing and my passion is for You and everyone else who wants to or has the opportunity to read Psych City. </p>
<p>You will help me achieve one of my greatest dreams and one of my greatest goals.</p>
<p>I began writing stories from the age of 9. Obviously, they were the ramblings and values of a child as most of them were of either me or another child playing with their friends and eating sweets, nowhere near bestsellers!</p>
<p>From the age of 9, society around me and many others have<u><i> crushed the dreams of people</i></u>.</p>
<p>Dreams began to feel a long way away and like they were <i>never reachable </i>but I know <u><strong>dreams are reachable</strong></u> and from the age of 9 i have wanted nothing more but to show the world that <strong><i>you can reach your dreams</i></strong>, you can accomplish your goal as long as you act on it and do it. </p>
<p>To be able to look at all the 9 year old's or anyone for that matter and be able to tell them that they could accomplish any thing they want to, will be the <u><i><strong>biggest accomplishment of my life. </strong></i></u></p>
<p><strong><u>This is what you will be contributing to.</u></strong> </p>
<p><i><strong>You will be contributing to the rebuilding of childhood dreams and achievement</strong></i>. You will be able to look at yourself and tell yourself that you can do what you. You can look at your children and tell them that they can be whatever they want to be. </p>
<p><u><strong>Dreams are not made to be broken. Dreams are made to be lived.</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong><i>WHAT WE NEED</i></strong></u></h3>
<p>The campaign minimum requirement is £500 / USD / CAD / EURO</p>
<p><u><strong>In all honesty, Every little helps.</strong></u></p>
<p>Any money we receive will go<strong> directly to the book</strong>, There will be <u><strong>no form of profit from contributions!</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><u><i>Fees that include 'going directly to the book' include</i></u>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Advertisement</strong></li>
<li><strong>Extra promotional items, including Hard back copies and Audio book formats.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Writing a book is the cheap part, it costs almost nothing to write. However, when publishing, expenses are incredible. </p>
<p><strong>Editing </strong>is to make sure the book is properly written, including spelling, grammar, punctuation and that sentences and even full paragraphs make sense and are easy to follow. This form is <u><i>expensive</i></u> as it is a <strong>purchasable service</strong> for physical time out of a persons day.</p>
<p><strong>Advertisement</strong> is also an expense as this is the <strong><i>main form of promotion</i></strong>  that Psych City will receive. My aim is to provide readers with a book that will impress them and spike joy within their lives. Even if only a small percentage of people can read it will still bring joy to me. </p>
<p><strong>Extra promotional</strong> items will be a<strong><i> grand addition to Psych City</i></strong> as the more formats, the <i><u>more enjoyable the content!</u></i> This will provide so many more people with the opportunity to acquire Psych City! <strong><u>Whether on the road,</u></strong> an <i><strong>audio book will provide a way so that you can listen to Psych City on the go!</strong></i></p>
<p>Finally, as an author, <strong>my ambition and my passion does not stop</strong>, not at one book!</p>
<p><u><i>My aim will continue</i></u>, even if every person on the planet had a copy of<strong> PSYCH CITY</strong>, that would not stop me from writing.<u><strong> One book will never be enough, which is why i will contribute towards another book. a message is impossible to spread unless repeated. </strong></u></p>
<p><i><u><strong>Funding, no matter the total outcome will be divided accordingly:</strong></u></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i><u>WHAT IF OVER THE MINIMUM IS REACHED?</u></i></strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>Any contribution amount will go towards the book</strong></i>. </p>
<p><i><u>Vary on the total may be accounted for due to editing only being required either once or twice</u></i>, in which case any excess will be divided from the percentage of editing (as shown) into the total of the remaining three percentages.</p>
<h3><i><u><strong>A little bit further</strong></u></i></h3>
<p>Editing is an extremely expensive process.</p>
<p>The minimum authors must pay to have a book reviewed, read and edited for each individual service is over £200. Meaning all three would be £600.</p>
<p>As an individualistic person, i prefer to edit myself and with the help of friends. If the target for the campaign was to be reached the extended funds would go directly to the book, mostly because there would be either little funding left or none at all. There is nothing but passion to push Psych City!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><i><u>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</u></i></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that anyone and anything faces challenges in life. Even if you were a billionaire, mistakes are made, you could knock over a glass of £100 water that was sourced off of the moon whilst sitting on top of the Eiffel Tower as The Queen of England gives you a back rub, but if you knocked over that £100 water, onto the laptop that carries the only bank account connected to your billionaire business, then you have a problem!</p>
<p>Risks and challenges are designed to be overcome, whether you are a billionaire who has just lost connection to his fortune, you can simply go to the bank and recover it. </p>
<p>There are risks and challenges in life, but no one has had to stop. </p>
<p><strong>Our challenges are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul><li>If there is no funding through this page, then it will financially be a struggle to popularise Psych City as the little money that I have to advertise with already, will have to stretch whilst keeping me alive.   <ul><li>Self motivation: Within life many people have great ideas, if not all of us, and many things can put you down. Motivation and emotion are a very severe combination.  As an individual I do all of the work myself: Involving, writing, marketing, purchasing, research, strategies and more. All of this often causes stress and worry, but my ability to push is what keeps me going. The problem here, is that completing a book is a very long process and some days may not see as good of an outcome as i would have wanted. </li></ul>
</li></ul>
</div><div><h3><strong><i><u>HOW TO OVERCOME OUR CHALLENGES</u></i></strong></h3></div><div>
<p>Challenges can sometimes be difficult to get through but they are not problems, no matter how many challenges are thrown at you, there will always be a way to complete what you are tasked to do. </p>
<p>This is how we will overcome these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money is not a rare source but publicity is. If no funding comes through then money will just have to be made! </li>
<li>Motivation is key, and the key is to surround yourself with people that can motivate you, whether that is a team or just your family and friends, people are always there to help you. </li>
</ul>
<p>So far I have found it difficult to FIND ANY challenges! This is mostly due to the fact that i think about them before hand and i find a solution before it even becomes a problem and i plan and prepare in order to keep a clear method to prevent challenge. </p>
<p>Indiegogo ASKS to share what qualifies me to overcome challenges. </p>

<h3><u><i><strong>How you can help without contributing!</strong></i></u></h3>
<p><strong>Money is sometimes hard to come by or sometimes we have to struggle to just to feed ourselves, pay rent or support our families, whether with children or with unable parents.</strong></p>

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
There is no doubt that anyone and anything faces challenges in life. Even if you were a billionaire, mistakes are made, you could knock over a glass of £100 water that was sourced off of the moon whilst sitting on top of the Eiffel Tower as The Queen of England gives you a back rub, but if you knocked over that £100 water, onto the laptop that carries the only bank account connected to your billionaire business, then you have a problem!
Risks and challenges are designed to be overcome, whether you are a billionaire who has just lost connection to his fortune, you can simply go to the bank and recover it. 
There are risks and challenges in life, but no one has had to stop. 
Our challenges are as follows:
If there is no funding through this page, then it will financially be a struggle to popularise Psych City as the little money that I have to advertise with already, will have to stretch whilst keeping me alive.   Self motivation: Within life many people have great ideas, if not all of us, and many things can put you down. Motivation and emotion are a very severe combination.  As an individual I do all of the work myself: Involving, writing, marketing, purchasing, research, strategies and more. All of this often causes stress and worry, but my ability to push is what keeps me going. The problem here, is that completing a book is a very long process and some days may not see as good of an outcome as i would have wanted. 

HOW TO OVERCOME OUR CHALLENGES
Challenges can sometimes be difficult to get through but they are not problems, no matter how many challenges are thrown at you, there will always be a way to complete what you are tasked to do. 
This is how we will overcome these challenges:

Money is not a rare source but publicity is. If no funding comes through then money will just have to be made! 
Motivation is key, and the key is to surround yourself with people that can motivate you, whether that is a team or just your family and friends, people are always there to help you. 

So far I have found it difficult to FIND ANY challenges! This is mostly due to the fact that i think about them before hand and i find a solution before it even becomes a problem and i plan and prepare in order to keep a clear method to prevent challenge. 
Indiegogo ASKS to share what qualifies me to overcome challenges. 
My reply is that i am only human. Together we make mistakes and together we fix those mistakes. 
Together we are human and together we are qualified to overcome any challenge that anyone or anything can throw at us.

How you can help without contributing!
Money is sometimes hard to come by or sometimes we have to struggle to just to feed ourselves, pay rent or support our families, whether with children or with unable parents.

<p>Jordon Greene and Caleb Wygal founded Franklin/Kerr Press, LLC in order to provide currently undiscovered authors another avenue to publish their work. As previously self-published and traditionally published authors, Jordon and Caleb understand that publishing a book isn't just writing the perfect manuscript when you go it alone.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who Was Abram Games? </strong>Abram Games was one of Britain's finest graphic designers, particularly admired for his posters, some of which are among the most recognisable of the 20th century. Always committed to public education, his work led him to be appointed as the Official War Artists for posters in 1942. His output was hugely varied, including advertisements, book jackets and stamps, but every design was informed by his motto, ‘maximum meaning, minimum means'. The results were always striking for their efficiency, directness and humour. Games was awarded an OBE for Services to Graphic Design and appointed Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Art.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Festival of Britain emblem, designed by Games</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>The Celebrated Poster: </strong>Among Abram Games's most admired creations was his design for the emblem of the Festival of Britain in 1951. But his single most widely known poster is the one commissioned for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Centenary Appeal in 1975. To create this design he took the names of all the plays as they appeared in the original 1623 First Folio and fitted them together like a jigsaw puzzle to form the head of Shakespeare (as it appears in Martin Droeshout's engraving that also appears in the First Folio). The effect was inspiring and immediately memorable; it was one of the last posters he designed and has become the most ubiquitous. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529751662/lfvtf93jagg1xqxonmdu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Games's poster, commissioned by the RSC</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><strong>The Unfinished Project:</strong> The poster was hailed a huge success by the RSC and as far as Abram's family knew at the time, he considered the job completed.</p>
<p>But thanks to an exciting discovery we now know that Abram’s intentions for the much-admired image went far further than a poster. </p>
<p>After his death in 1996, Abram's daughter and archivist, Naomi Games, happened upon a mock-up he had made of a flickbook based on the poster image. As she turned the pages of the book Shakespeare's face gradually appeared, one play at a time. From the designs she could see that her father had even experimented with getting Shakespeare to wink!</p>
<p>It was beautiful and ingenious and in that moment Naomi determined not to let the idea go with Abram to the grave but that one day she would publish the flickbook and see the project through to the end.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529751827/jbn0mzjdjamaeuggogf5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A younger Abram Games with the 'Join the ATS' women's recruitment poster of 1941</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the flickbook was not all that she discovered among Abram's papers. In a document headed ‘Shakespeare Title-Portrait Project’, packed in among a number of old designs and pieces of writing, Naomi uncovered a whole list, accompanied by sketches, of further ideas for the poster image. </p>
<p>It quickly became clear that Abram had intended to print the image of Shakespeare's head onto a whole range of objects including mugs, jigsaws and glassware. You can see how carefully these ideas had been thought through by his labelled plans for an umbrella for the RSC, below.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529751954/sx6pkzs1yxm5fmlw4w7x.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>An initial design by Games for an umbrella featuring Shakespeare's face</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Finishing the Project:</strong> Now 22 years on, we at Pallas Athene have worked with Naomi to complete Abram’s plans and bring his buried project to life.</p>
<p>The flickbook has been carefully put together to follow Abram's prototype as closely as possible. The effect is striking; as the pages are turned and the portrait comes into view, Shakespeare's face comes alive through movement, as does the brilliance of the idea behind it. </p>
<p>To accompany the flickbook we are also producing objects featuring the Shakespeare poster image. Excited by the possibilities, we went beyond the ideas which Abram proposed; so as well as the mug, the jigsaw and a decanter, we are producing T-shirts, tea towels, prints and more.  </p>
<p>When choosing the pieces, we put a particular emphasis on quality - it seemed only right that Abram's high-quality designs should be complemented by high-quality products from the finest manufacturers.  </p>
<p>All of the pieces are available as perks - please see details below (and to the right).</p>
</div><p> </p><h2>The Perks</h2><p> </p><h3><i>10% of All Perk Prices Will Be Donated to Shakespeare's Globe</i></h3><p>Ten per cent of all perk prices will be given to Shakespeare's Globe in London (registered charity no. 266916).</p><p>Shakespeare's Globe houses a reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, an Elizabethan playhouse associated with Shakespeare, on the south bank of the River Thames. The theatre invites visitors from all over the world to watch productions ranging from original practices to world premières of new writing.

Who Was Abram Games? Abram Games was one of Britain's finest graphic designers, particularly admired for his posters, some of which are among the most recognisable of the 20th century. Always committed to public education, his work led him to be appointed as the Official War Artists for posters in 1942. His output was hugely varied, including advertisements, book jackets and stamps, but every design was informed by his motto, ‘maximum meaning, minimum means'. The results were always striking for their efficiency, directness and humour. Games was awarded an OBE for Services to Graphic Design and appointed Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Art.

Some of Abram's best-known posters
 

The Festival of Britain emblem, designed by Games
 
The Celebrated Poster: Among Abram Games's most admired creations was his design for the emblem of the Festival of Britain in 1951. But his single most widely known poster is the one commissioned for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Centenary Appeal in 1975. To create this design he took the names of all the plays as they appeared in the original 1623 First Folio and fitted them together like a jigsaw puzzle to form the head of Shakespeare (as it appears in Martin Droeshout's engraving that also appears in the First Folio). The effect was inspiring and immediately memorable; it was one of the last posters he designed and has become the most ubiquitous.

Games's poster, commissioned by the RSC
 
The Unfinished Project: The poster was hailed a huge success by the RSC and as far as Abram's family knew at the time, he considered the job completed.
But thanks to an exciting discovery we now know that Abram’s intentions for the much-admired image went far further than a poster. 
After his death in 1996, Abram's daughter and archivist, Naomi Games, happened upon a mock-up he had made of a flickbook based on the poster image. As she turned the pages of the book Shakespeare's face gradually appeared, one play at a time. From the designs she could see that her father had even experimented with getting Shakespeare to wink!
It was beautiful and ingenious and in that moment Naomi determined not to let the idea go with Abram to the grave but that one day she would publish the flickbook and see the project through to the end.

But the flickbook was not all that she discovered among Abram's papers. In a document headed ‘Shakespeare Title-Portrait Project’, packed in among a number of old designs and pieces of writing, Naomi uncovered a whole list, accompanied by sketches, of further ideas for the poster image. 
It quickly became clear that Abram had intended to print the image of Shakespeare's head onto a whole range of objects including mugs, jigsaws and glassware. You can see how carefully these ideas had been thought through by his labelled plans for an umbrella for the RSC, below.

Finishing the Project: Now 22 years on, we at Pallas Athene have worked with Naomi to complete Abram’s plans and bring his buried project to life.
The flickbook has been carefully put together to follow Abram's prototype as closely as possible. The effect is striking; as the pages are turned and the portrait comes into view, Shakespeare's face comes alive through movement, as does the brilliance of the idea behind it. 
To accompany the flickbook we are also producing objects featuring the Shakespeare poster image. Excited by the possibilities, we went beyond the ideas which Abram proposed; so as well as the mug, the jigsaw and a decanter, we are producing T-shirts, tea towels, prints and more.  
When choosing the pieces, we put a particular emphasis on quality - it seemed only right that Abram's high-quality designs should be complemented by high-quality products from the finest manufacturers.  
All of the pieces are available as perks - please see details below (and to the right).
 The Perks 10% of All Perk Prices Will Be Donated to Shakespeare's GlobeTen per cent of all perk prices will be given to Shakespeare's Globe in London (registered charity no. 266916).Shakespeare's Globe houses a reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, an Elizabethan playhouse associated with Shakespeare, on the south bank of the River Thames. The theatre invites visitors from all over the world to watch productions ranging from original practices to world premières of new writing. The site also includes an educational and rehearsal studio complex and an exhibition about Shakespeare's life and work. Shakespeare's Globe continues to expand their programme of public events, school and university courses, and work with the Southwark Community. The Globe receives no public subsidy, but can be said to have revolutionised Shakespeare production and study - and to have opened the eyes of hundreds of thousands of visitors to the glories of Shakespeare's work.We are proud to be able to contribute to this truly valuable institution. The Shakespeare FlickbookThe flickbook has been made in close collaboration with Abram Games's daughter and archivist, Naomi Games, to ensure that it is as close to Games's original design as possible.  Our only additions have been to complete Abram's sequence of quotations from each play that appear on the left hand pages - for the entertainment of the reader (or flicker!) - as well as a brief introduction by Naomi which explains the story behind the flickbook and how it came to be. All 37 plays are included, in the order they are printed in the First Folio of 1623, ending with Pericles, Prince of Tyre, first included in the Third Folio of 1664. The poems, and some of the plays not published in the Folios have been added for completeness. ***Early bird offer: the first 70 copies to be ordered will be signed by Naomi Games.

I was fascinated by their stories and how much they knew about my country – even more than I did at the time!</p><p>After two years working in a hostel, I learned so much about travelling and discovering new places that I decided to write a guide to my wonderful country, dedicated to those that are travelling in Colombia for a month. At the beginning of 2018, I decided to quit my job to travel through Colombia, discovering the best of the culture, people, landscapes, food, accommodation and festivals, describing in my notebook the things that I wanted to share. Little by little the idea of the book became an idea of micro-enterprise.

<li>The design of our website: This will help us to get closer to cities and small towns of our country with natural paradises that very few people know about.</li>
<li>The physical printing of our book Guide to distribute in different establishments and sell on Amazon.</li>
<li>Advertising our Instagram website with photos and videos of the experiences of travelers by our country.</li>
</ul><p>If we complete the desired budget the total development of our initial project, (which is with the Colombia country) will be possible to carry out all our plans that is why we seek the support of stakeholders to achieve the goal of €5,000.</p><p>Our intention is to create and produce our own brand, i.e. that our guidebooks did not work with any Publisher and everything we produce will be of our company.</p><p><strong>WHERE THE FOUNDS GO?</strong></p><ul>
<li>€500 will go toward Indiegogo and processing fees.</li>
<li>€2500  will go toward compiling and printing an initial run of 1000 books.</li>
<li>€1500  will go toward website design and media publicity.</li>
<li>€500  will go toward translation of the book in English/ French/ German.</li>
</ul><p><strong>WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT TO US?</strong></p><p>While there are many commercially produced tourist guides, GET LOST IN, will focus on producing a guide that promises great travel experiences AND support to local businesses and communities. In developing a travel guide that hopes strike a good balance between local interest and tourism we think we have produced a fun and exciting guide to Latin America that is beneficial to all stakeholders.</p><p>It is important for us to change the image that some Latin American countries, recognizing its shortcomings but highlighting all the magic that can be found once you are there. Each year the number of travelers increases and it is gratifying to know that things are changing. However, I feel that it’s still very important to contribute to this positive change.</p><p>In the process of building my dream and starting my company I've noticed how hard it is for young entrepreneurs to start their own projects and to secure the support to make their ambitions a reality.

I was fascinated by their stories and how much they knew about my country – even more than I did at the time!After two years working in a hostel, I learned so much about travelling and discovering new places that I decided to write a guide to my wonderful country, dedicated to those that are travelling in Colombia for a month. At the beginning of 2018, I decided to quit my job to travel through Colombia, discovering the best of the culture, people, landscapes, food, accommodation and festivals, describing in my notebook the things that I wanted to share. Little by little the idea of the book became an idea of micro-enterprise. My goal is now to make this happen so that I can show the best of my country with visitors from all over the world.WHAT IS, GET LOST IN?GET LOST IN, It is a Colombian micro-company that was born with the intention of showing the best of tourist destinations in four countries in Latin America, with a focus on local culture and experiences. We work with people who, like me, are interested in supporting local organisations and communities.OUR GOAL:Since our company is starting up, our budget is not sufficient to achieve the necessary goals which are:
The design of our website: This will help us to get closer to cities and small towns of our country with natural paradises that very few people know about.
The physical printing of our book Guide to distribute in different establishments and sell on Amazon.
Advertising our Instagram website with photos and videos of the experiences of travelers by our country.
If we complete the desired budget the total development of our initial project, (which is with the Colombia country) will be possible to carry out all our plans that is why we seek the support of stakeholders to achieve the goal of €5,000.Our intention is to create and produce our own brand, i.e. that our guidebooks did not work with any Publisher and everything we produce will be of our company.WHERE THE FOUNDS GO?
€500 will go toward Indiegogo and processing fees.
€2500  will go toward compiling and printing an initial run of 1000 books.
€1500  will go toward website design and media publicity.
€500  will go toward translation of the book in English/ French/ German.
WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT TO US?While there are many commercially produced tourist guides, GET LOST IN, will focus on producing a guide that promises great travel experiences AND support to local businesses and communities. In developing a travel guide that hopes strike a good balance between local interest and tourism we think we have produced a fun and exciting guide to Latin America that is beneficial to all stakeholders.It is important for us to change the image that some Latin American countries, recognizing its shortcomings but highlighting all the magic that can be found once you are there. Each year the number of travelers increases and it is gratifying to know that things are changing. However, I feel that it’s still very important to contribute to this positive change.In the process of building my dream and starting my company I've noticed how hard it is for young entrepreneurs to start their own projects and to secure the support to make their ambitions a reality. This is why all of the places that we recommend in our books are specially selected to support local communities, businesses and farms.In producing the first edition of the guide I’ve had tremendous support from the businesses I’ve talked with.This is because when you use a Get Lost In guide, you are contributing to something greater than just your travel experience.OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTION:

A world of readers & writers continue to be neglected and considered secondary to profit margins! If the total of all stories being written in the world was represented by an iceberg, then the old-fashioned publishers are only publishing the tip, leaving a world of stories lost until now. Nettpress is designed to bring the rest of the stories to the surface allowing ANY author to publish their stories for readers to enjoy. Who knows, we might find the next J.K. Rowling or Shakespeare hidden away.The Nettpress platform is alive and already in use with writers publishing and the feedback so far has been amazing!We are now looking to put the icing on the cake with the world class Nettpress App! This is set to turbo charge the entire environment for all readers and writers to enjoy.

We believe that neither money or executive opinion should block creativity and imagination EVER.The book publishing industry has been a nightmare for writers wanting to get published for way too long. 
Rejection letters

Time & Money involved building your own website
 These are just some of the issues Nettpress solves because publishing just got smarter!We have moved the power of publishing to YOU the writer so, YOU get to decide what, when, where and how to publish your work.

Thank You...We wish to personally thank everyone who contributes, as writers ourselves we have been through the heartaches, struggles, painful submission processes, rejection letters, the huge cost of self publishing and just how unfair the publishing industry can feel.With these funds we can continue to make a huge change in the industry, helping writers achieve their dreams of becoming published authors. Nettpress is for ALL writers from any nationality. Whether you are a complete novice or experienced author, young or old, male or female it doesn't discriminate. See where funds are being allocated and the difference you will be making -This is a breakdown of where the funds will be allocated, everything raised will be used towards the growth of Nettpress to benefit all readers and writers. $18,000 to $20,000 AUD - Custom Built Nettpress App This is the major component of our campaign, we have built the vehicle and this will be like the petrol/gas that will keep it running. We will be building the fully functioning Nettpress App on iOS and Android.This will be connected seamlessly with the main Nettpress platform allowing all the amazing current & future features to be conveniently available with the touch of an icon.Not only creating a writers dream publishing App, combined with the Nibbler also creates a phenomenal reading App connecting writers and readers on any device anywhere around the world.​This is a large task as it will be a stand alone App and not built on a third party platform. After researching and meetings with developers we were also shocked at the cost of a stand alone app however to have the functionality custom built and also be available live in both Apple & Android app stores for downloading this is what's required.We have investigated other cheaper alternatives with 3rd party providers but this comes with limits/restrictions on what is possible. We also foresee that a stand alone app would still need to be built down the track which would only cause further complications when trying to transition into a different app at a later stage.With a custom built app means there will be less restrictions as things grow and we can constantly upgrade and improve the user experience for all involved. This will be a world class App of the highest quality for all to enjoy! $3,500 AUD - Design and Editing Software PackageWe will always be looking for ways to improve Nettpress and offer even more value to writers.

<h3>The Human Nature Tarot</h3>
<p>The Human Nature Tarot deck will be an 80 card deck, with a two extra cards in the Major Arcana, Card 22 - Beyond and a Happy Squirrel Card. The court cards will be gender neutral: Child, Warrior, Ruler and Elder, reflecting the natural cycle of life and a more inclusive gender equality narrative. It will include a 100 page guide book with images of the cards, key words from years of teaching tarot, and special notes from the photographer. Some of the photos have a story of their own!</p>
<p>The Human Nature Lenormand is going to be so much fun. I started reading with playing cards as a kid and the Lenormand format is that simple with more intuitive depth. There will be an extra man and woman card for gender preference and specific questions. Wildlife and landscape photos are a perfect fit for the Lenormand. I can't wait to build the Human Nature Lenormand and see them in action in a Grand Tableau!</p>
<p>The Human Nature Tarot Workbook is a long time coming. My students and friends have asked me for years to write a book on the tarot. Making a workbook speaks to my philosophy of hands on learning. In my classes, I guide students to create their own workbook. The Human Nature Tarot Workbook will draw from handouts and materials I use in my classes, discussions I've had with students and colleagues, and have a few pointers specific to The Human Nature Tarot. I'm partial to a 6"" x 9"" journal size for easier transport, and hopefully a spiral or lay flat binding for easy access. The point is to create an organized place for your  journey with the tarot. </p>
<p>I'm excited to see high quality photos of nature and wildlife in a Tarot deck. Aren't you?</p>

<h3>Something Different</h3>
<p>I'm tired of Rider Waite Smith replays. I'm over tarot decks full of straight white people with mild expressions. I'm tired of cheesy mass produced art. I'm annoyed by decks with awesome major arcana and dead boring number cards. I'm over digital collage cards that are too chaotic to read. I'm so tired of the 6 million Lo Scarebo decks and gilded Angel Oracle cards. I love crazy wild fantasy cards, indie art collective decks and awesome theme style cards but they're not always functional to read with. </p>
<p>I want cards that speak to the heart. I want high quality images of real things. Our world is beautiful and rich with meaning as it is. We don't need archaic representations to get there. The tarot is a living tool. The meanings grow with us. I want cards that have a thoughtful structure and an inclusive worldview. Most Animal and Plant Spirit decks talk about ancient mythology. Nature is not a myth. It's alive now. So is the Tarot. Let the beauty of our world speak for itself. Look the animals in their eyes. Feel the majesty of the tallest trees. Look at nature through these cards and let it speak to you. </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Lisa MoonCat and I love Tarot. I've been reading cards and teaching tarot professionally since 2010. I run a tarot meetup in Portland, OR. I write a blog on tarot and astrology. I've been reading cards since I was a little girl. I want people to fall in love with Tarot and use it to grow as people. I've read stacks of books on the Tarot. I've played with more decks than I can remember. I published a book in 2012 called Energy Magic: A Ritual Guide where I touch briefly on Tarot in nature based Ritual practice. Nature recharges me and inspires my spiritual practice. Bringing the tarot to life through epic natural photography is a dream I've had for years. I'm lucky to know someone who travels far and wide, with a camera and an artistic eye.  </p>
<p>Tony Trupp is a world traveler, photographer, kayak enthusiast and lovely human being. His Spirit for adventure and careful perception are the starting place of The Human Nature Tarot. His lens captures the attitude and actions of wild creatures. The beauty of his landscape and architecture shots hits you right in the third eye. He's hiked and kayaked into some incredible remote places, been careful and patient enough to witness wildlife, and brought home treasures in the form of beautiful photographs. These images are the stuff of inspiration. A perfect body of work to build into a tool for exploring the human soul. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$5000 will get the cards printed. I've found a US based printer that makes quality cards with proper card stock. The smallest print run for a custom project like this is 250 items. Add in shipping and time wrangling cards and the cost creeps up and up. </p>
<p>If we get fully funded or beyond it will move up the ship date. The more funds I have up front, the sooner we get these amazing cards. I'd love to have the Tarot art to the publisher by October 2018. The Lenormand will come next and the Workbook after that. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds will go to printing the cards and getting a website setup for regular orders. The less funding we get, the slower the cards will be in the making, cuz a girl's gotta eat.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've self published before. I know how much time and effort it takes. These cards want to be made. I'm going as fast as I can without compromising intention. The more funding I have, the more time I can devote to turning these images into an amazing Tarot and Lenormand and building the workbook to use them. </p>
<p>Backing this project is pretty low risk. The major arcana of the Human Nature Tarot and a chunk of the minor cards are done. Indiegogo is a great platform to get the word out. I want to see these cards in action. I've started picking  cards electronically from the ones I've finished and they already read with depth and clarity. </p>

</div></div>","The Human Nature Tarot
The Human Nature Tarot deck will be an 80 card deck, with a two extra cards in the Major Arcana, Card 22 - Beyond and a Happy Squirrel Card. The court cards will be gender neutral: Child, Warrior, Ruler and Elder, reflecting the natural cycle of life and a more inclusive gender equality narrative. It will include a 100 page guide book with images of the cards, key words from years of teaching tarot, and special notes from the photographer. Some of the photos have a story of their own!
The Human Nature Lenormand is going to be so much fun. I started reading with playing cards as a kid and the Lenormand format is that simple with more intuitive depth. There will be an extra man and woman card for gender preference and specific questions. Wildlife and landscape photos are a perfect fit for the Lenormand.

<li>Hello. My name is Annette McFarlane, I have many years of experience working with and observing children of all ages. At about age 12, I started working with kids, and have been doing so my entire adult life. I have a passion to teach children the Word of God and teach Sunday school classes. I believe it's crucial for kids to develop their own relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. For the past 20 years, I have kept a journal of poems and short songs the Lord placed on my heart to sing to young children in Sunday school. I also completed a study during college on memorization and rhyme and how they correlate. I won an award for my thesis and study. The book, “Miss Purtell’s Challenge,” illustrates my passion for seeing children come to faith in Christ and live victoriously.  My daughter, Jaime Hilton, has a Christian CD for kids and a butterfly video on youtube. </li>

The publisher’s responsibilities will include handling the cover (the illustrations on this web site are not the ones that will be used for this book) and page design, furnishing the illustrations, facilitating the printing of the book and marketing the book. Plans are for the book to be distributed through national bookstores, including Barnes &amp; Nobel as well as Christian distributors such as Spring Arbor.</li>
<li>A key concept behind “Miss Purtell’s Challenge” is kids reading, memorizing and applying scriptures to issues they face in their daily lives. I used rhyme, rap, songs, and poems to help kids easily memorize key scriptures, which will transform their lives,The poems, songs and raps are all inspired by the Spirit of God. When children read and hear poetry, rap and songs, they are encouraged to be creative as well. Poetry fills the mind with new ways of communicating ideas, thoughts and feelings.

<p>As educators, Alli and Kathleen, create interactive experiences to engage students in K-12 in the work of the world.  Dr. Sawaya is a wildlife researcher studying bears, among other creatures, to try to understand animal behavior.  His fascinating study about bears spending time in ponds, lakes, and stock tanks to cool off in order to conserve fat supplies in late summer prior to denning inspired <strong><i>BEAR IN THE BATHTUB</i></strong>.   Kids LOVE this topic and are hungry to know more about our world, the changes happening, and the impact changes are making on our wildlife.  </p>
<p>Rather than a straight non-fiction book, we invited student voice by opening up an art contest to students across the country, asking them to imagine what bears would be doing in bathtubs.  The relatable fiction story and original artwork about Mia, her adventures, and a bear that resides in her bathtub introduces the concept of bear biology in a creative way.  Then we follow it up with the explanation of bear behavior in Yellowstone National Park from Dr. Sawaya's recent study.</p>
<p>This passion project is an extension of the work the three of us do every day.   It is our life's work, it needs doing, and the positive impact on a generation of children who may or may not have contact with the natural world is extremely important.  If kids are not curious and are not seeking to understand, how can they care and protect?  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Both Inspired Classroom and Sinopah Wildlife Research Associates are small, boot-strapped businesses.  Most of our income comes from projects with clients or grant funding.  In addition, our missions include giving back to our world, so we have determined that part of the proceeds of the sale of <i><strong>Bear in the Bathtub </strong></i>will go to the protection of bear habitat in our neck of the woods.   With distribution and retail costs, that doesn't leave much to pay for printing.  But we didn't want to drop the idea--it is too important to our mission--so the three of us made a commitment to print 3000 books.  To do this, we had to take out a small loan and dip into our personal pockets.  </p>
<p>We are asking for $5,000 to help defray part of the printing costs and pay back the loan. Anything we make from this campaign will go toward those costs. </p>
<p>We would love to have you join us as collaborators on this collaborative project!  If you contribute a minimum of $15, you will receive a copy of <i><strong>BEAR IN THE BATHTUB</strong></i> signed by all three authors!  What could be better?  It is a great addition to your library and a fun way to take a quick trip to the great outdoors, </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Translating the world to kids in a real way is one of the most important responsibilities <u>all</u> adults have.  You can be part of this important work by supporting our crazy project.  The<i><strong> BEAR IN THE BATHTUB</strong></i> project is completed.  It is at the printers, so IT IS HAPPENING.  Other similar collaborations are in the works too.  It is all part of the plan to get authentic information into kids hands--not something nice--SOMETHING NECESSARY! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Again, we have made a commitment to print this book.  It is a stretch for both of our businesses to financially take on.   We want to be sure we can produce passion projects like this that further our missions in the future but need a bit of support right now to minimize the financial pinch.  Anything you can do would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Youths Empowered For Your Success: Take The Right Action Today For Your Success Tomorrow</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>How My Youth Empowerment Mission Got Started</h3>
<p>Growing up, I was always told that I was different because I did not do what everybody else was doing. As I grew older, I realized that youths in general can do much more than what they were doing. I became more conscious of the self-destructive path so many youths were on. </p>
<p>Hence, at 11 years old I asked my parents permission to get on social media with one aim in mind and that was to post inspirational message to reach out to my peers. At 12 years old, I wanted to do more to reach more youths, so I started writing Youths Empowered For success but did not have the means to get out to my peers so I sat on it whilst still giving value to my peers via social media. On my 15th birthday last November, I created 3 journals to help my peers to be more organized and focused. To learn more about me please <a href=""https://youthempowermentpodcast.com/index.php/subscribe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">go here</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>At the start of 2019, I realized that rather than decreasing, bullying and suicide among teens were on the increase so I decided that It was time to get my book Youths Empowered For Success out to youths. As a result, I decided that I would seek your help to get my book out to youths all over because I know the power of youths empowering youths.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>In February, 2019 I launched Youth Empowerment Podcast which inspires, empowers and give business ideas to youths to ensure they take the right action today for the success they want tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Unmask Me"" gives an element of play using opening paper flaps. This activity, combined with easy reading entertains the child with a ""big reveal"" under each mask. The goal is to help children think about their peers in and out of the classroom. What could our face masks be hiding? What are we missing about each other by wearing masks?</p>
<p>I am a caricature artist, as well as a designer/author. I've drawn thousands of faces in my 25 years as a professional caricaturist, and every person's face tells a story. Faces are important. The eyes might be the windows to the soul, but our faces communicate more clearly what the eyes want to express. </p>
<p>I look forward to the day we can stop hiding behind our masks, free to be, and free to see each other again!</p>
<p>I hope very much that if you identify with the message of this book, you will contribute and/or share this campaign on your social media platform.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The funds received from this campaign will cover the following printing/production costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of printing 500 copies (printing by PrintNinja.com) for soft cover books with full color printing and paper flaps inside (16-page interior with 7 paper flap attachments).</li>
<li>Shipping costs of 500 books from printer</li>
<li>Cost for physical proofing from printer</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Book Description:</strong></h3>
<p>The book will be soft cover, saddle stitched, with paper flaps inside which open &amp; close. It is full color, overall. I'm using PrintNinja.com as my printer for production.</p>

<b><br/><h3><b><b>Short Summary</b></b></h3>The Storyline, or actually a Group of Storylines will be Translated into English (from Finnish) when
completing the Startup of the First 10 Books Translation Project all done by me. 
</b>
<p>The First 10 Books Translation Project is a
remarkable starter for publishing all the books of my ""Early Production"" written in Finnish, by completing the first 10 translations out of
over 50 books. <br/></p>
<p>Five book series of the project, the first two books of each series will get continuing publications in the future. Plus the other books and book series of the ""Early Production"" collection as well.</p>
<p>“In an unseen attempt of
literature, facing a phenomenal personal Mission Impossible to translate over
50 books of the ""Early Production"", written in my prior native language, Finnish, and now translated to a current ""native"" language, English, being then completed in two
different languages.”</p>Well... ""How to eat an elephant? One spoonful at a time.""<br/>It means by completing one book at the time. <br/><br/>""I have written all those books so I will translate them too, even so it seems like a Mission Impossible at first, but by the time being, one book at the time, all the books will be completed and published. That's my Big Dream, always has been.""<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455013650/ydblcd928ublbvhyuah5.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 378.597px; height: 505px;""/></p>

<br/>
<h3><b><b>The Story of Storylines</b></b></h3>
<p>“By the way, there is a
unique story about every book, book series and writer personas which belong to the project. And that makes it great, it being a Story of Storylines.”</p>
<p>The Wild Royce character I
created and the Storyline I wrote, 8 books in total for now, were for the Love of my 4 Children, dedicated to them, just like all the
other children’s book series were. </p>
<p>The beginning of the entire Family of the
Book Series was created in the time when we were “Living on the Beach”. An unforgettable wonderful Family Lifestyle of Travelers, Beach-life, the world being our playground, with freedom of playful joyfulness and infinite
fictive creation of stories.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348628/files/20150402024314-Sand_Castle.jpg?1427967794"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WILD ROYCE Series by Will Willeroy</b><br/></p>
<p>Our Kids have always been
interested in animals and been taking care of all kinds of little nature
creatures. They were very interested in crocodiles, lizards, dinosaurs as well as
all the animals and the nature. 

</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348633/files/20150402024456-Dinosaur_Park_1.JPG?1427967896"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That is why I wrote an
adventure where a little child is living and adventuring with animals, Wild Royce with
a Great Crocodile friend called Big Daddy, (a character of a real crocodile we
once met in Spain, one of the biggest and oldest crocodile in the world), among
numerous other animal friends.</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>ROYCE PIROT Series by Will Willeroy</b><br/></p>
<p>The Royce Pirot series is kind a continuing Storyline from the Wild Royce series Storyline. The storyline (10 books for now)
emerges also from my Children being interested in the pirates and the history of them, and also from the seaside
beach-life we were living by our hearts.
</p>
<p>One of the creator’s secrets is that, “Please keep the secret”, Wild Royce and Royce Pirot are actually the same
person, just in at a different age and time.<br/></p>
<p>The Black Beard found a young boy, later named as Royce Pirot,
at the Caribbean Seas drifting with his little wrecked boat...<br/></p>
<p>This finding comes sometime
after Wild Royce finally took the risk to head off from his island,
towards the sea horizon and new adventures, with his little boat in which he had
wrecked onto his Paradian Paradise Island years ago when being a little boy.</p>
<p></p>Royce Pirot's adventures are full of action, living and fighting with pirates, commanding his own pirate ship and a grew of young children, legendary Young Pirates, sailing the Caribbean Seas.<br/><br/><br/><b>REMAX Series by Dino X.</b><br/><br/><p>The Remax Series comes from
my Kids interest to Dinosaurs. I wanted to write a storyline of a young boy
called Max, adventuring in the unpredictable prehistoric world with great and dangerous prehistoric
animals, and especially with a friendship with the great friend of Tyrannosaur
Rex.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>By their actions based on their brave hearts they came to be the
Kings of the Dinoxworld, an adventurous brave partnership, exploring the most
unpredictable and unknown human-prehistoric-dinosaur-world, in a fictional life, at the time as the world was back then when there were the people living with prehistoric
mammals, being the world of dinosaurs, human tribes, ancient civilizations and the
secrets of the Mother Nature.</p>
<p>Once again a creator’s
secret is that, “Please keep the secret”, Wild Royce’s fascinating cave art
findings, when exploring his island and discovering its secrets, were created
and first appeared, long, long time ago, in the storyline of Remax by prehistoric
explorer Max. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>ROYAL Series by Jaron Piroy</b><br/></p>
<p>The Book Series Family
continues with the storyline of Royal. <br/></p>
<p>A creator’s secret is, once again,
“Please keep the secret”, that a huge treasury, very old shipwreck, down at the
sea bottom, deep there in where he was diving with his life in danger, a discovery was made and
riches following from that lucky strike…</p>
<p>The secret is that the
shipwreck Royal discovered, the huge treasury, was actually created by Royce
Pirot’s great efforts and fights, when he was racing against the Black Beard,
their Great Treasury Hunt rallying on the Caribbean Seas, against each other and the other Pirates as well,
when looking for hidden Pirate Treasuries, growing the riches in their ship’s
holds.</p>
<p>With the same rightness and
values as in every storyline, in this Great Story Family of Storylines, is
Royal investing his riches to fight for rightness against injustice,
wrongdoers, criminal organizations and even dictatorial governments, to correct
terrors, abuses, destruction and criminality.</p>

<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348685/files/20150402031128-Jarno_Ahonen_-_Audiobooks_Collection_iTunes.jpg?1427969488"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>I have written
fairly over 50 books with different writer names. Here is why...</p>
<p>I love movies,
books, good stories and visual experiences, as well as real life experiences. I have always been
highly admiring authors as well as movie stars, story creators and producers, characters and actors, especially how brilliantly they can play their
roles as being real. 
</p>
<p>With all of my
appreciation and esteem to all of them…</p>
<p>That is how I
can see my writing creation experience – Living in a real-time-movie.</p>
<p>My way to write
and to create the story is highly intuitive, intensive and interactive. My way is to go
in to a movie-kind of a role play in my mind, being in the scenery of the story, start
creating, exploring in the characters role, as in a movie.
</p>
<p>Experiencing
with the character, in his role, I am experiencing the story creation and
happening as a real-time-experience. For me it is all real, actual experience,
in a present time, everything appearing as new to me, real-time-reality, when
living in my imagination.</p>
<p>My way to
create is highly intensive, as a real 5D visual experience, full-fiction-reality, adventuring in the real-time-story-creation,
being deeply concentrated, sometimes as if in a trance.</p>
<p>Adventuring in
the Creation of my “Fancy Galaxy Imaginarium” I am, at the very moment,
enjoying events, excited about tension, laughing at events out loud when something
sudden and funny happens, sweating when running, rushing on and having as well
sweet as hard times…</p>
<p>And my fingers
are tapping the story happenings down with a high speed typing… Me in, the story creation advancing at the same time when my fingertips are printing it out from the deeps of my creative Imaginarium, fictional infinity, transmitting by a mind-galactic hyper-loop from the Fancy Galaxy, appearing on my computer screen. Later on, so often wondering when reading the story afterwards ""was it me who wrote this?""<br/></p>
<p>Okay, that is
my way to create and experience the stories. I Love It! I really do.</p>
<p>All of the author names of mine, such as Jaron Piroy, Will Willeroy, Dino X., Mirella Magine,
J.J.Trywell and others… are like director roles of the movie-like-story creation to
me. </p>
<p>They are author names, Role Play Characters, everyone specialized to direct with their
specific style and interests... directing the shooting according to the
screenplay of filming.</p>
<p>And as well as
every director, every movie done and the production, is a creation, so are my
Author Role Plays. </p>
<p>In every scene, chapter, play,
shooting, framing and creation I put a big part of me in it, as a director, a main
character and often in some side roles too. As said, I Love It! All, over and
over again...</p>
<p>It’s a Big Deal
to me, giving me Big Times, and I hope you’ll enjoy then too.</p>
<p>“The more real the experience of the story is, the better it is.”</p>

<h3><b><b>Multilingual Indie Author Family<br/></b></b></h3>
<p>All the 50+
books published this far I have published by my own publishing deeds as being an independent
– Indie Author.</p>
<p>The WOWBOOKS is
my publishing brand and the logic is simple…</p>
<p>WoW – World of
Words. A logo has been illustrated to describe the thinking of my creation. And
what’s the best in it, the logo’s design has done by my son Miro when he was 10
years old. A little o in between two capital W letters, ultimate elements ice and fire, is the source of my
Imaginarium called The Fancy Galaxy. That is where I am adventuring when
bursting out stories…</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348687/files/20150402031408-Jarno_Ahonen_-_WoW_-_World_of_Words_Logo.jpg?1427969648"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I Love writing
and creating... That is my principal motive of doing my job. I just love it,
and that is why I keep writing.</p>
<p>But selling,
marketing and promoting, all that is a very tough task for me. I always thought
“if I would just write”. My thinking is that everyone should make what they like the
most, and my choice is very clear.</p>
<p>But, more buts... At the moment I am keen to do more. I want to write, more and more, as much as before in my prior native language Finnish, now in my current ""new native"" language English. But I also
want to do as much as I can for the public works. Still, pro sales and
marketing persons are the best to do their job, but I want to be connected,
cooperate and see the world of literature at its fullest.</p>
<p>""Early 50+ Books” I have written in Finnish, as it was the most comfortable writing language
of mine before… Even though we have been living in France and Spain the most of the time for over 12 years now, traveling, and even though the Family is multilingual
primarily in English and German, with fluent Finnish, well also French and Spanish knowledge
(plus some other languages too). </p>
<p>The reason we
spoke Finnish before was for teaching it to our children, and also it was used for homeschooling partly in
Finnish, and for maintaining it in some practical level. Earlier, we used to
speak Finnish it only being as our home-language and English we spoke with our friends. But then we quit Finnish entirely, using only English, it being more comfortable for us and also practical in every way,
with the use of some other languages of and for our daily living environments and connections.</p>
<p>And now also,
personally, entirely, I have quit writing in my previous native language Finnish too, a few
years ago, transforming step by step to write in English as it being my ""new native” language,
as well for spoken as written and also for expression of my literary arts. Practically, a complete transformation such like
that is quite a big challenge for a pro writer, but I have done my move without a
return… </p>
<p>And I love it,
I always did. Even back then when I wrote in Finnish I was partly thinking in English,
actually complicating and often mixing both languages, being unsure of any,
making it “characteristic”, as kind of English expression in my books in Finnish has been
always recognizable. My books have well been unique and personal in Finnish, and that is how it will be also in English, being the fact I just have to accept. But now and also in the future being, I am only writing with one language, English, making it well comfortable for me. <br/></p>
<p>In Finland,
being a real Pro Indie Author is very exceptional. Principally, almost all the
pro literacy in Finland is supported and done by governmental allowances and
also mostly bought by governmental instances, especially libraries. There are
very limited private markets as a real business, if any at all, when talking about the literature,
simply because the markets are so small within a nation of only about 5 million people.</p>
<p>But even so the
fact is, the only real thing I was ever interested in has been
publishing in English, worldwide, and also internationally in some other main
world languages when it will be possible, I wanted to product and publish a big bunch of my books in Finnish
too<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348689/files/20150402031500-Jarno_Ahonen_iTunes_Books_in_Finnish_1.jpg?1427969700"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As the literacy
in Finland is deeply old fashioned and supported by the government, it is mostly all the money pouring in for insiders, and especially
when being different and extremely productive, the only choice was to make it
all on my own. I have been like that all of my life “very much indie of everything” and
that is how I wanted to product my books too. I wanted to learn the whole chain
of the book production.</p>
<p>I have never
received any penny of any literacy allowances, that being a big difference compared to most of the authors in
Finland, I have done it all by my own money by selling books and in
“indie-artistic” ways. I love being an artist and artistic too. And I am proud of it,
proud of being a pure Indie Author.</p>

<p>Now, when
considering publishing worldwide, in English and perhaps with some other main
languages too, I want to connect and cooperate. I want to “Make It Big” still
being a real Indie Author, but with cooperation with as many as possible.</p>
<p>The most what I
want is to connect with the people among the literature, authors and all the other
working within the same fashion than me. I want to see and experience the World of Words, more and
more.</p>
<p>“Indie Author,
that’s what I’ve always been, I am, and how it will be.”</p>

<h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>When wondering if 
there are other ways you can show your support without contributing? Well, there are! You can help:</p>
<b><ul>
<li>Tell your friends! Share the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or your social media platform of choice. <b>
</b>
</li>

<li>I am also seeking proofreaders (US Eng) 
as all the books will need a proper proofreading to be edited and 
completed for publishing, even so I will publish all the books completed by myself for now, but at once there is an option to have a new edition trimmed by pro editors I will make it. I'm a writer and creator fitted with an enormous 
imagination, and even though I am working only in English nowadays, I definitely need 
cooperation with proofreaders to make it pro.</li>
<li>I am also seeking pro marketers, author's agents or any other helpful cooperation for marketing and to boost sales. ""I am a tool, just need someone to wrench.""</li>
<li>I am 
also seeking cooperation for my new production too to ease my way. It is a very hard job to do it all by myself...
 As fitted with extraordinary productivity (several books a year) 
thanks to my great love of writing, favor of living and experiencing in my 
interactive creation process, in the Fancy Galaxy Imaginarium... Well, I wish I would just write.<br/>

</div></div>","Short SummaryThe Storyline, or actually a Group of Storylines will be Translated into English (from Finnish) when
completing the Startup of the First 10 Books Translation Project all done by me. 

The First 10 Books Translation Project is a
remarkable starter for publishing all the books of my ""Early Production"" written in Finnish, by completing the first 10 translations out of
over 50 books. 
Five book series of the project, the first two books of each series will get continuing publications in the future. Plus the other books and book series of the ""Early Production"" collection as well.
“In an unseen attempt of
literature, facing a phenomenal personal Mission Impossible to translate over
50 books of the ""Early Production"", written in my prior native language, Finnish, and now translated to a current ""native"" language, English, being then completed in two
different languages.”Well... ""How to eat an elephant? One spoonful at a time.""It means by completing one book at the time. ""I have written all those books so I will translate them too, even so it seems like a Mission Impossible at first, but by the time being, one book at the time, all the books will be completed and published. That's my Big Dream, always has been.""


The Story of Storylines
“By the way, there is a
unique story about every book, book series and writer personas which belong to the project. And that makes it great, it being a Story of Storylines.”
The Wild Royce character I
created and the Storyline I wrote, 8 books in total for now, were for the Love of my 4 Children, dedicated to them, just like all the
other children’s book series were. 
The beginning of the entire Family of the
Book Series was created in the time when we were “Living on the Beach”. An unforgettable wonderful Family Lifestyle of Travelers, Beach-life, the world being our playground, with freedom of playful joyfulness and infinite
fictive creation of stories.


WILD ROYCE Series by Will Willeroy
Our Kids have always been
interested in animals and been taking care of all kinds of little nature
creatures. They were very interested in crocodiles, lizards, dinosaurs as well as
all the animals and the nature. 



That is why I wrote an
adventure where a little child is living and adventuring with animals, Wild Royce with
a Great Crocodile friend called Big Daddy, (a character of a real crocodile we
once met in Spain, one of the biggest and oldest crocodile in the world), among
numerous other animal friends.


ROYCE PIROT Series by Will Willeroy
The Royce Pirot series is kind a continuing Storyline from the Wild Royce series Storyline. The storyline (10 books for now)
emerges also from my Children being interested in the pirates and the history of them, and also from the seaside
beach-life we were living by our hearts.

One of the creator’s secrets is that, “Please keep the secret”, Wild Royce and Royce Pirot are actually the same
person, just in at a different age and time.
The Black Beard found a young boy, later named as Royce Pirot,
at the Caribbean Seas drifting with his little wrecked boat...
This finding comes sometime
after Wild Royce finally took the risk to head off from his island,
towards the sea horizon and new adventures, with his little boat in which he had
wrecked onto his Paradian Paradise Island years ago when being a little boy.
Royce Pirot's adventures are full of action, living and fighting with pirates, commanding his own pirate ship and a grew of young children, legendary Young Pirates, sailing the Caribbean Seas.REMAX Series by Dino X.The Remax Series comes from
my Kids interest to Dinosaurs. I wanted to write a storyline of a young boy
called Max, adventuring in the unpredictable prehistoric world with great and dangerous prehistoric
animals, and especially with a friendship with the great friend of Tyrannosaur
Rex.  

By their actions based on their brave hearts they came to be the
Kings of the Dinoxworld, an adventurous brave partnership, exploring the most
unpredictable and unknown human-prehistoric-dinosaur-world, in a fictional life, at the time as the world was back then when there were the people living with prehistoric
mammals, being the world of dinosaurs, human tribes, ancient civilizations and the
secrets of the Mother Nature.
Once again a creator’s
secret is that, “Please keep the secret”, Wild Royce’s fascinating cave art
findings, when exploring his island and discovering its secrets, were created
and first appeared, long, long time ago, in the storyline of Remax by prehistoric
explorer Max. 

ROYAL Series by Jaron Piroy
The Book Series Family
continues with the storyline of Royal. 
A creator’s secret is, once again,
“Please keep the secret”, that a huge treasury, very old shipwreck, down at the
sea bottom, deep there in where he was diving with his life in danger, a discovery was made and
riches following from that lucky strike…
The secret is that the
shipwreck Royal discovered, the huge treasury, was actually created by Royce
Pirot’s great efforts and fights, when he was racing against the Black Beard,
their Great Treasury Hunt rallying on the Caribbean Seas, against each other and the other Pirates as well,
when looking for hidden Pirate Treasuries, growing the riches in their ship’s
holds.
With the same rightness and
values as in every storyline, in this Great Story Family of Storylines, is
Royal investing his riches to fight for rightness against injustice,
wrongdoers, criminal organizations and even dictatorial governments, to correct
terrors, abuses, destruction and criminality.


QUEEN Series by Mirella Magine
The Book Series Family gets
its Queen, when Dynacos, a handsome Frenchman, discovers a Young fascinating
beauty, called Queen, at the streets of the New York. Impressive success
follows when Queen explores her new lifestyle and surges on the top of the Fashion
World.  

By the way, the very first
Queen book, a young beauty’s success with world of fashion elements and
romance, the beginning of the storyline of Queen, was written for, with
dedicated order of my dear companion of life for over 20 years now, “in the whirl
of the life of an artistry”, and a loving mother of our the most loved
Children. 
Queen’s future adventures,
as well as her fascinating ancestry, her eagerness for thrill, taking risks
when facing dangers, and unbelievable happenings within the glamorous Fashion
World, its riches and beauties, and everything related to that, suits so well
together with the principles of charming and captivating Dynacos…
The man with secrecy of his
origins and uncertainty of his powers and wealth sources, with the related
mystery of the other great “invisible” character, Royal…
Author's Role Play


I have written
fairly over 50 books with different writer names. Here is why...
I love movies,
books, good stories and visual experiences, as well as real life experiences. I have always been
highly admiring authors as well as movie stars, story creators and producers, characters and actors, especially how brilliantly they can play their
roles as being real. 

With all of my
appreciation and esteem to all of them…
That is how I
can see my writing creation experience – Living in a real-time-movie.
My way to write
and to create the story is highly intuitive, intensive and interactive. My way is to go
in to a movie-kind of a role play in my mind, being in the scenery of the story, start
creating, exploring in the characters role, as in a movie.

Experiencing
with the character, in his role, I am experiencing the story creation and
happening as a real-time-experience. For me it is all real, actual experience,
in a present time, everything appearing as new to me, real-time-reality, when
living in my imagination.
My way to
create is highly intensive, as a real 5D visual experience, full-fiction-reality, adventuring in the real-time-story-creation,
being deeply concentrated, sometimes as if in a trance.
Adventuring in
the Creation of my “Fancy Galaxy Imaginarium” I am, at the very moment,
enjoying events, excited about tension, laughing at events out loud when something
sudden and funny happens, sweating when running, rushing on and having as well
sweet as hard times…
And my fingers
are tapping the story happenings down with a high speed typing… Me in, the story creation advancing at the same time when my fingertips are printing it out from the deeps of my creative Imaginarium, fictional infinity, transmitting by a mind-galactic hyper-loop from the Fancy Galaxy, appearing on my computer screen. Later on, so often wondering when reading the story afterwards ""was it me who wrote this?""
Okay, that is
my way to create and experience the stories. I Love It! I really do.
All of the author names of mine, such as Jaron Piroy, Will Willeroy, Dino X., Mirella Magine,
J.J.Trywell and others… are like director roles of the movie-like-story creation to
me. 
They are author names, Role Play Characters, everyone specialized to direct with their
specific style and interests... directing the shooting according to the
screenplay of filming.
And as well as
every director, every movie done and the production, is a creation, so are my
Author Role Plays. 
In every scene, chapter, play,
shooting, framing and creation I put a big part of me in it, as a director, a main
character and often in some side roles too. As said, I Love It! All, over and
over again...
It’s a Big Deal
to me, giving me Big Times, and I hope you’ll enjoy then too.
“The more real the experience of the story is, the better it is.”


Multilingual Indie Author Family
All the 50+
books published this far I have published by my own publishing deeds as being an independent
– Indie Author.
The WOWBOOKS is
my publishing brand and the logic is simple…
WoW – World of
Words. A logo has been illustrated to describe the thinking of my creation. And
what’s the best in it, the logo’s design has done by my son Miro when he was 10
years old. A little o in between two capital W letters, ultimate elements ice and fire, is the source of my
Imaginarium called The Fancy Galaxy. That is where I am adventuring when
bursting out stories…

I Love writing
and creating... That is my principal motive of doing my job. I just love it,
and that is why I keep writing.
But selling,
marketing and promoting, all that is a very tough task for me. I always thought
“if I would just write”. My thinking is that everyone should make what they like the
most, and my choice is very clear.
But, more buts... At the moment I am keen to do more. I want to write, more and more, as much as before in my prior native language Finnish, now in my current ""new native"" language English. But I also
want to do as much as I can for the public works. Still, pro sales and
marketing persons are the best to do their job, but I want to be connected,
cooperate and see the world of literature at its fullest.
""Early 50+ Books” I have written in Finnish, as it was the most comfortable writing language
of mine before… Even though we have been living in France and Spain the most of the time for over 12 years now, traveling, and even though the Family is multilingual
primarily in English and German, with fluent Finnish, well also French and Spanish knowledge
(plus some other languages too). 
The reason we
spoke Finnish before was for teaching it to our children, and also it was used for homeschooling partly in
Finnish, and for maintaining it in some practical level. Earlier, we used to
speak Finnish it only being as our home-language and English we spoke with our friends. But then we quit Finnish entirely, using only English, it being more comfortable for us and also practical in every way,
with the use of some other languages of and for our daily living environments and connections.
And now also,
personally, entirely, I have quit writing in my previous native language Finnish too, a few
years ago, transforming step by step to write in English as it being my ""new native” language,
as well for spoken as written and also for expression of my literary arts. Practically, a complete transformation such like
that is quite a big challenge for a pro writer, but I have done my move without a
return… 
And I love it,
I always did. Even back then when I wrote in Finnish I was partly thinking in English,
actually complicating and often mixing both languages, being unsure of any,
making it “characteristic”, as kind of English expression in my books in Finnish has been
always recognizable. My books have well been unique and personal in Finnish, and that is how it will be also in English, being the fact I just have to accept. But now and also in the future being, I am only writing with one language, English, making it well comfortable for me. 
In Finland,
being a real Pro Indie Author is very exceptional. Principally, almost all the
pro literacy in Finland is supported and done by governmental allowances and
also mostly bought by governmental instances, especially libraries. There are
very limited private markets as a real business, if any at all, when talking about the literature,
simply because the markets are so small within a nation of only about 5 million people.
But even so the
fact is, the only real thing I was ever interested in has been
publishing in English, worldwide, and also internationally in some other main
world languages when it will be possible, I wanted to product and publish a big bunch of my books in Finnish
too

As the literacy
in Finland is deeply old fashioned and supported by the government, it is mostly all the money pouring in for insiders, and especially
when being different and extremely productive, the only choice was to make it
all on my own. I have been like that all of my life “very much indie of everything” and
that is how I wanted to product my books too. I wanted to learn the whole chain
of the book production.
I have never
received any penny of any literacy allowances, that being a big difference compared to most of the authors in
Finland, I have done it all by my own money by selling books and in
“indie-artistic” ways. I love being an artist and artistic too. And I am proud of it,
proud of being a pure Indie Author.

Now, when
considering publishing worldwide, in English and perhaps with some other main
languages too, I want to connect and cooperate. I want to “Make It Big” still
being a real Indie Author, but with cooperation with as many as possible.
The most what I
want is to connect with the people among the literature, authors and all the other
working within the same fashion than me. I want to see and experience the World of Words, more and
more.
“Indie Author,
that’s what I’ve always been, I am, and how it will be.”

Other Ways You Can Help
When wondering if 
there are other ways you can show your support without contributing? Well, there are! You can help:

Tell your friends! Share the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, or your social media platform of choice. 


If
 you are a reviewer or reporter, you have a blog or a podcast, consider 
interviewing me during or after the project! It's my pleasure to tell 
the story of anything wanted.

I am seeking cover illustrators as all the books published in the future, by the 
project plus new books coming, will get a new cover design, so please let me know if you know one or 
contact if you are a designer.

I am also seeking proofreaders (US Eng) 
as all the books will need a proper proofreading to be edited and 
completed for publishing, even so I will publish all the books completed by myself for now, but at once there is an option to have a new edition trimmed by pro editors I will make it. I'm a writer and creator fitted with an enormous 
imagination, and even though I am working only in English nowadays, I definitely need 
cooperation with proofreaders to make it pro.
I am also seeking pro marketers, author's agents or any other helpful cooperation for marketing and to boost sales. ""I am a tool, just need someone to wrench.""
I am 
also seeking cooperation for my new production too to ease my way. It is a very hard job to do it all by myself...
 As fitted with extraordinary productivity (several books a year) 
thanks to my great love of writing, favor of living and experiencing in my 
interactive creation process, in the Fancy Galaxy Imaginarium... Well, I wish I would just write.



Thank you so much in advance for backing this crowdfunding campaign! Your support matters!

<p>WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS AIMING FOR :</p>
<p>This campaign aims to collect funds for professional editional and graphic works, writing stories of pre-war Kresy (Polish Eastern Borderlands), editorial office and finally printing at least 1.000 pieces of an album-book, enriched with exclusive archival photographs, documents, biographs, stories and video interviews I've collected during my researches in Poland, England, Scotland and Wales as well as former Kresy COUNTRIES: Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania in past few years. This book is planned to be the first of the series.</p>
<p>YOU CAN HELP TO PRESERVE THIS INCREDIBLE HISTORY TOO!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT IS ""EASTERN BORLDERLANDS - KRESY FOREVER"" PROJECT ABOUT:</p>
<p>“Eastern Borderlands Forever” is a project I call the “Project of my life” I was dreaming of for years. It was developed with the assistance of the Foundation for Help and Polish Connection ""KRESY RP"" as well as the Association of Former POWs of the Home Army at its first (UK) and second (Ukriane, Belarus and Lithuania) stages of realisation and supported by the Senate of the Republic of Poland in 2017 and 2018.  It is mainly directed at Poles abroad, especially Polish children and youth who are living outside the borders of Poland, as well as everyone who holds the traditions and history of the former borderlands close to their hearts.  The project which contain an exhibition, web-portal KresyNieutracone.pl, interactive workshops and multimedia presentations aims to introduce the history and culture of pre-war Poland, in particular that of the former Eastern Borderlands, and their impact on the development of Polish tradition and culture.</p>
<p>The “Eastern Borderlands Forever” project consists of:</p>
<p>Digitizing and preserving scattered and disappearing collections in various national and private archives</p>
<p>Creating modern educational materials, to support the education of Polish youth in Poland and abroad</p>
<p>Disseminating knowledge about Polish history, culture and tradition</p>
<p>Developing a national identity among Polish youth, who are growing up in Poland and abroad</p>
<p>Supporting and building conscious civic outlooks</p>
<p>Creating a generational ""bridge"" between the ""old"" and the ""new"" Polish emigration in the world</p>
<p>Building a cohesive knowledge base concerning the culture, history and traditions of the Polish Eastern Borderlands</p>
<p>Restoring the meaning of the term ""Borderlands"" - their place and role in Polish history and culture - in the minds of young people growing up in Poland and abroad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WAS DONE UNTIL NOW:</p>
<p>This project consists in the digitization and dissemination of archival collections primarily located outside Poland.  In addition to its educational value, it has added value in the form of organizing and digitizing archival materials associated with the Eastern Borderlands which are held in private hands. The owners are primarily individuals who left their homeland during and after World War II and never returned as well as thiose who were left outside Polish borders after WW2 and lived in the USSR and now in independent countries.</p>
<p>The first and second stages of the project (2017 &amp; 2018) covered the territory of the United Kingdom and also - partly - Poland as well as Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. During my researches I was able to find and digitize almost more than 5.000 pre-war documents and photographs, mostly unpublished and in some cases even unseen for more than 70 years. However, in subsequent years, I plan to carry out work in other European and non-European countries to find, digitize, preserve and publish as many as possible of those archival treasures.  Through my work, I want to save and make public these generally-unknown images of the Eastern Borderlands - lost as a result of war and political upheavals, but preserved in the form of archival photographs and documents. This is why my project is called “Eastern Borderlands Forever” or ""Kresy Nieutracone"" in Polish which means ""Kresy Never Lost"".</p>
<p>Until now I was able to produce the following:</p>
<p>- Web-portal named ""Kresy Nieutracone"" (<a href=""http://www.KRESYNIEUTRACONE.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.KRESYNIEUTRACONE.pl</a>) which contain a huge part of my digitizing and archival work since 2000 until now with it's social media support (<a href=""http://www.FB.COM/KresyNieutracone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.FB.COM/KresyNieutracone</a>, <a href=""http://www.INSTAGRAM.COM/kresy_nieutracone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.INSTAGRAM.COM/kresy_nieutracone</a>)</p>
<p>- Mobile multilingual exhibition containing 30 roll-ups (2m x 1m) and presenting the most beutiful photographs and documents from pre-war Eastern Borderlands</p>
<p>- Interactive workshops / presentations</p>
<p>- Movies, interviews with witnesses to the History (oral history project)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHY THIS STORY MATTERS:</p>
<p>The ""Eastern Borderlands Forever"" project combines the features of an archiving and a research project, but its main value is to support the education of Polish youth living far from their native tradition, culture and history.  The Eastern Borderlands were an integral part of Poland for pre-WW2 generations, yet for young people of the 21st century they has often become devoid of meaning.  I also believe that the implementation of this project will contribute to bridging the ""old"" and ""new"" emigration generations, for the benefit of both parties.  Witnesses of history, with extensive and interesting archival materials, can become an inspiration for young people who are slowly losing their Polish roots. This can be an invaluable boost for elderly, and often lonely, people. </p>
<p>The ""Eastern Borderlands Forever"" project has a farther reach than any other digitalization, archival or educational project, becoming a bridge between old and new, between the past and the present, as well as providing support to Poles who have permanently emigrated.</p>
<p>I would also like to emphasize that previous digitalisation of private archives, both in Poland and abroad, has not been conducted on a scale beyond the initiatives of individual non-governmental organizations and within a cohesive project. The effects of these activities have often been wasted, through ineffective promotion, or inadequate sharing of the collected materials with a wider audience.  As these witnesses to history leave us in increasing numbers, there is a threat that these materials will be lost or destroyed after their death.  Consequently, implementing this project now is extremely important, in order to preserve these valuable collections for future generations. </p>
</div></div>","WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS AIMING FOR :
This campaign aims to collect funds for professional editional and graphic works, writing stories of pre-war Kresy (Polish Eastern Borderlands), editorial office and finally printing at least 1.000 pieces of an album-book, enriched with exclusive archival photographs, documents, biographs, stories and video interviews I've collected during my researches in Poland, England, Scotland and Wales as well as former Kresy COUNTRIES: Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania in past few years. This book is planned to be the first of the series.
YOU CAN HELP TO PRESERVE THIS INCREDIBLE HISTORY TOO!
 
WHAT IS ""EASTERN BORLDERLANDS - KRESY FOREVER"" PROJECT ABOUT:
“Eastern Borderlands Forever” is a project I call the “Project of my life” I was dreaming of for years. It was developed with the assistance of the Foundation for Help and Polish Connection ""KRESY RP"" as well as the Association of Former POWs of the Home Army at its first (UK) and second (Ukriane, Belarus and Lithuania) stages of realisation and supported by the Senate of the Republic of Poland in 2017 and 2018.  It is mainly directed at Poles abroad, especially Polish children and youth who are living outside the borders of Poland, as well as everyone who holds the traditions and history of the former borderlands close to their hearts.  The project which contain an exhibition, web-portal KresyNieutracone.pl, interactive workshops and multimedia presentations aims to introduce the history and culture of pre-war Poland, in particular that of the former Eastern Borderlands, and their impact on the development of Polish tradition and culture.
The “Eastern Borderlands Forever” project consists of:
Digitizing and preserving scattered and disappearing collections in various national and private archives
Creating modern educational materials, to support the education of Polish youth in Poland and abroad
Disseminating knowledge about Polish history, culture and tradition
Developing a national identity among Polish youth, who are growing up in Poland and abroad
Supporting and building conscious civic outlooks
Creating a generational ""bridge"" between the ""old"" and the ""new"" Polish emigration in the world
Building a cohesive knowledge base concerning the culture, history and traditions of the Polish Eastern Borderlands
Restoring the meaning of the term ""Borderlands"" - their place and role in Polish history and culture - in the minds of young people growing up in Poland and abroad
 
WHAT WAS DONE UNTIL NOW:
This project consists in the digitization and dissemination of archival collections primarily located outside Poland.  In addition to its educational value, it has added value in the form of organizing and digitizing archival materials associated with the Eastern Borderlands which are held in private hands. The owners are primarily individuals who left their homeland during and after World War II and never returned as well as thiose who were left outside Polish borders after WW2 and lived in the USSR and now in independent countries.
The first and second stages of the project (2017 & 2018) covered the territory of the United Kingdom and also - partly - Poland as well as Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine. During my researches I was able to find and digitize almost more than 5.000 pre-war documents and photographs, mostly unpublished and in some cases even unseen for more than 70 years. However, in subsequent years, I plan to carry out work in other European and non-European countries to find, digitize, preserve and publish as many as possible of those archival treasures.  Through my work, I want to save and make public these generally-unknown images of the Eastern Borderlands - lost as a result of war and political upheavals, but preserved in the form of archival photographs and documents. This is why my project is called “Eastern Borderlands Forever” or ""Kresy Nieutracone"" in Polish which means ""Kresy Never Lost"".
Until now I was able to produce the following:
- Web-portal named ""Kresy Nieutracone"" (www.KRESYNIEUTRACONE.pl) which contain a huge part of my digitizing and archival work since 2000 until now with it's social media support (www.FB.COM/KresyNieutracone, www.INSTAGRAM.COM/kresy_nieutracone)
- Mobile multilingual exhibition containing 30 roll-ups (2m x 1m) and presenting the most beutiful photographs and documents from pre-war Eastern Borderlands
- Interactive workshops / presentations
- Movies, interviews with witnesses to the History (oral history project)

<h3>In Short: The Novel</h3>
<p><strong>'Durga Noir'</strong> is a pulp style detective noir thriller set in an alternative history world that the author is building.</p>
<p>The main action takes places in 1970s Calcutta where a down at heel private eye is hired to help find the missing wife of a billionaire industrialist, a small catch being the that the vanished spouse is an old flame of the dysfunctional detective.</p>
<p>Why has the wife gone missing? Who is responsible? Who is the mysterious ‘Irishman’? What is the connection with a seemingly catastrophic event in the prologue?</p>
<p>The Calcutta of this world is a teeming metropolis with a seething underbelly as you would expect in one of the major cities of the vast and powerful Bharat Empire.</p>
<p>A second narrative thread covers a longer period from the early days of The Second World War through to the mid-1950s and explores the intertwined histories of the principal characters. Further this thread gives the chance to explore many of the unique differences between our universe and the alternative history presented here.</p>
<p>As the plot progress it will become clear that the past of the protagonist and the major supporting characters are intimately intertwined with the current mystery.</p>
<p>The detective will discover that he is in fact a pawn in a large-scale conspiracy that threatens the stability of the Empire, being manipulated by a fundamentalist faction who wish to blame the Catholic minority for a planned terrorist atrocity, thus enabling the suppression of that religion.</p>
<p>Though as a 'pulp' style novel the character's may seem initially to be cliche'd and stereotypical there will be significant character development, particularly via the secondary narrative thread which will fully flesh out the characters, their motivations, and provide them with satisfying narrative arcs.</p>
<p>This novel is intended as the entry point to a new fictional world developed by myself, the world of The Bharat Empire, a universe where the India Empire still exists, but is ruled mainly by Indian Babus.</p>
<h3>In Short: The Series</h3>
<p>With a successful launch of the debut novel the aim then is to fully flesh out the history this storied world over two or three subsequent novels.</p>
<p>In the World of the 'Bharat Empire' the British Indian Empire still exists and rivals the United States for dominance across the World. This isn't the British Raj as we know it however; this is an Indian Raj ruled principally by Desi statesmen since the days of the Bengali Renaissance in the 1800s.</p>
<p>The author is a British citizen who has spent many years living and working in India and who has a great respect for the history and culture of both nations. This valuable perspective has led to a unique setting with a fusion of our modern World and the Bengal of the Babus.</p>
<p>Later novels in the series will cover the history of the Empire, how it diverged from our own history, why it did so, and who is responsible. The author is keen to explore as many facets of the setting as possible and expects that future works will defy standard genre descriptions. The range of the narratives will cover ancient history through to the far future and involve science fiction, historical drama, time travel, romance, adventure, and yes, more thrillers.</p>
<h3>In Short: The Author </h3>
<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Robert Owen</strong> a first time novelist who's been an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction works since first picking up 'The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe' around the age of seven.  It's been my dream to become a published novelist pretty much since I could read, however like most folks that dream disappeared under the relentless grind of modern life.</p>
<p>Recently however life threw me a curve ball as my marriage disintegrated, and through those smoking ruins, I suddenly realised that I had actually been presented with a reset moment. It was now or never, try and maybe fail, but at least I had chance to finally give it  a shot. </p>
<p>If I can successfully build the 'Bharat Empire' my eventual aim is to make this an 'open universe' where other writers and contributors can add to the mythos, this way the world can be enjoyed by as many people as possible, in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>I'm conscious that for most of my life I've been a consumer only, however this is my opportunity to finally create something and get it out there in the great big wide World to be enjoyed by others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I plan to self publish the novel initially via Quignog a specialist in the Indian market, who offer a very comprehensive package including intensive marketing on Amazon and in 'brick and mortar' stores. I intend utilising their 'Hurricane' package which can be found here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.quignog.com/plans-and-supplements/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.quignog.com/plans-and-supplements/</a></p>
<p>Funds then will be used to fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package from Quignog which will cost circa £3,100 ($4,100 or INR 289,000).</li>
<li>Professional editing for the novel before submission to the publisher (Quignog offer one round as part of their package but I would prefer this is done beforehand for expediency).</li>
<li>Proof reading - as above for the editing with the same rationale.</li>
<li>Costs to promote  'Durga Noir' via author signings and book store events - these aren't included in the Quignog package and will require additional funding - I intended promoting the novel myself in both India and the UK.</li>
<li>Mailing and shipping costs for copies that are provided as perks to contributors. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>I'll be offering a range of perks for my valued contributors:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will all receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>A signed limited edition (100 units) hardbound copy will also be available.</li>
<li>Online access for all contributors to early chapters.</li>
<li>Online access for all to the audio book of 'Durga Noir' as and when I release chapters.</li>
<li>The opportunity to be mentioned in the acknowledgements alongside my family and heroes. </li>
<li>The opportunity to be included in the book (or one of your loved ones if you so choose) as a minor character.</li>
<li>The opportunity to be included in the book (or one of your loved ones if you so choose) as a minor character, and then as a recurring supporting character throughout the series (whom I, cross my heart, will absolutely will not kill off, honest guvnor). </li>
<li>The opportunity for all to contribute ideas and stories to the world of the 'Bharat Empire'.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Buy contributing you will help me fulfil a lifelong ambition to become a published author, and by getting this first novel off the ground together we can launch a whole new series and develop a whole new world.</p>
<p>By reaching the 10,000 sales mark the publisher will automatically kick the book upstairs to their parent company Pirate Publishers who will offer a book deal, and I feel likely a deal for the entire series.</p>
<p>Given the commitment to marketing in the publisher's proffered package I believe this is a realistic target with online and physical sales taken into account.</p>
<p>Once a deal for a series is achieved I can continue to lay down the history of the 'Bharat Empire' and I will invite other authors to contribute to the world. If I can help others cut their teeth in writing via this approach I would be extremely proud.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with the writing of any book the main risk must be not getting a finished product to the reader, however as the book it self is nearly finished the main risk with this project is getting the publication right. </p>
<p>Quignog have a good reputation in India and I have physically and independently verified the existence of their published units prominently displayed in proper bookshops in some of the largest cities in India. </p>
<p>Further they guarantee a strong on-line presence and marketing via Goodreads and Amazon Kindle.</p>
<p>More than anything I believe the marketing support from Quignog will make this publication a success.</p>
<p>A further challenge maybe the prospect of the book failing to find a readership. I've written the book as a fusion between Western and Desi (Indian) culture and history, with the idea that it will appeal to readers from both of those worlds. The danger though is that it might 'fall between' two stools so to speak and appeal to neither. In mitigation of this risk I have lived and worked in India for several years, and was married to an Indian lady for seven years - during these years I devoured Bengali food, films, literature, and culture with a healthy dollop of Hindi films and serials thrown in for good measure.  I feel that I have sufficient grasp of both the Desi and Western worlds to make the novel work in both,</p>

<p>This book I originally wrote for my daughter who had many problems with food. They did not want to eat vegetables that were unknown to her.<br/>I started cooking with her and made up stories with the ingredients</p>
<p>As she has learned more and more about them, she started to eat everything I put on the table in front of her. This experience has led me to make a children's book in the hope that I can help others with it</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you can find in the Book</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The book has 15 little stories of 15 different vegetables.</p>
<p>All stories have 2 illustrations and a summary where you can find the hidden facts from the tales about the vegetables with some extra child friendly information and an extra drawing of how the vegetables look like in real life.</p>

<h3>Why is there so many Language?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I wrote the book for my daughter at the beginning. We raise our children in three languages. I'm from Hungary my partner from Portugal and we live in Germany. I wanted her to share the book with anyone who was close to her without any language problems</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For what exactly I need fundation?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As I said my mother tongue is not English, and I'm sure after several checks can still find grammatical errors in my project, so I definitely need grammatical correction and of course the translations for the different languages.</p>
<p>But where I want to invest the most money is the drawings and illustrations. I want to have this book very colorful. The more support I can have the more design I can put in.</p>
<p>what has the same priority with me is the general quality of the book. Thicker pages for easy scrolling and high quality printing for the colored images</p>

The book has 15 little stories of 15 different vegetables.
All stories have 2 illustrations and a summary where you can find the hidden facts from the tales about the vegetables with some extra child friendly information and an extra drawing of how the vegetables look like in real life.

 

 
Why is there so many Language?
 
As I mentioned above, I wrote the book for my daughter at the beginning. We raise our children in three languages. I'm from Hungary my partner from Portugal and we live in Germany. I wanted her to share the book with anyone who was close to her without any language problems
 
For what exactly I need fundation?
 
As I said my mother tongue is not English, and I'm sure after several checks can still find grammatical errors in my project, so I definitely need grammatical correction and of course the translations for the different languages.
But where I want to invest the most money is the drawings and illustrations. I want to have this book very colorful. The more support I can have the more design I can put in.
what has the same priority with me is the general quality of the book. Thicker pages for easy scrolling and high quality printing for the colored images

<p>Howdy, folks! I'm Matt Spencer, a passionate storyteller with a dark sense of humor and long history of short stories and novellas published in various magazines and anthologies over the years, as well as several novels. Of late, I've gotten fed up with the traditional publishing world, after the current publisher was bought out by new management who've all but run the company into the ground and dragged my up and coming writing career to a crawl. So here I am, learning the business of independent publishing as I go, and finding out that the old saying ""You have to spend money to make money"" must have been coined for this racket. So for my first foray into independent publishing, I've decided to assemble a collection of some of my best short fiction. By ""best"", I mean both stories that have received the strongest responses from readers over the years, and those that mean a lot to me. By contributing to this campaign, you'll not only be helping me assemble a handsome, professionally assembled volume, but also giving me a jump promoting the hell out of it, getting it in front of the largest audience possible.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What People Are Already Saying:</h3>
<p>Of the stories to be included in this collection, here's what readers have already had to say about a few of them<br/><br/><strong>""Just Chew Your Way Out"":</strong></p>
<p>""Cassias isn’t in the best place in his life. His princess-girlfriend is in a magic coma and he’s stuck out in the hinterlands finding the bits and pieces of magic he hopes will bring her back to him. He’s a got a magic sword he’s bonded to his body and a head full of black magic tricks to put him one up on anyone else around. But after one betrayal too many, he’s out for revenge… but once he starts on that path he loses control of where it takes him.</p>
<p>Spencer writes great grimdark fantasy, and Cassias is a great trickster character I hope the world gets to see a lot more of. He’s more trickster than a straight up blood-and-guts barbarian, and trends more toward anti-hero than traditional hero. That said, if you are looking for a quick bite of fiction, you can do a lot worse than this and not a lot better."" - Matthew Gomez, editor at <i>Broadswords and Blasters</i></p>
<p>""When stand-up comedian/mage/sword-swinging badass Cassias falls for an up-and-coming princess, he'll stop at nothing to make sure they're together, even if it means wandering the countryside and making bad deal after bad deal. This time, the bad deal may have been a step too far, as Cassias has thrown his lot in with a Priest King, who has his own plans for using Cassias, and they may or may not involve his famed skills with blade or magic.</p>
<p>I'll be honest in that the voice took some getting used to for me, what with a very modern sensibility from Cassias mashed up with a rather formal old-school fantasy tone from surrounding characters, especially the Priest King. But after a page or so I forgot all about those concerns and just let myself enjoy the unfolding story. Spencer writes pulp fiction in a voice that is irreverent and fun. This story is well worth the time I spent reading it."" - Cameron Mount, editor at <i>Broadswords and Blasters</i></p>
<p><strong>""Lambs of Slaughter In Blue And Gold""</strong></p>
<p>""What’s a ghost to do when his lover is reborn in the same small town where they were killed so many years ago by the cult that controls it? What can he do when he sees her living her life, but his body is all razor blades and sharp ends? And what will happen if she ever wakes up to her life before?</p>
<p>More horror and urban fantasy, Spencer hits all the right notes of a could-be toxic relationship and how the real monster might be the last person you expect it to be. My biggest regret for this piece is that it isn’t a bit longer, doesn’t get a little more into the meat of the character, but all the rage and impotence of being able to see the world, of being close to a person you love without being able to fully be with them is well executed. <br/>If you are looking for a quick sharp jab of a story, Spencer has you covered."" - Matthew Gomez, editor at <i>Broadswords and Blasters</i></p>
<p>""What sort of life can you lead if you and your lover have been sacrificed by an ancient cult? How about when your lover is reborn without the memories of her passing, and she unintentionally summons your spirit to hover in her wake? Matt Spencer explores the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, and vengeance in this short urban fantasy. This story engenders the right level of disjointed questioning on the part of the reader to really sink home the same sort of disjointed questioning in the narrator. He knows just as much as we do, which might be frustrating for some readers, but students of unreliable narrators should be okay.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> I'd like to see more of this couple, possibly in a series of linked stories or perhaps in a longer short story or novella."" - </span>Cameron Mount, editor at <i>Broadswords and Blasters</i></p>
<p><strong>""Island of Skulls""</strong></p>
<p>""This extended fantasy short story is a real treat. In my experience, good fantasy writing is difficult to achieve, one reason being that I'm always comparing such stories to the sheer inventiveness, masterful descriptions and original world building of Martin, Tolkien and Howard. But Matt Spencer comes close—extremely close. After just a few sentences, you are immersed in this world. People and place names sound like they 'fit', rich prose puts you in the scene with descriptions involving all 5 senses.<br/>The story has a Conan or King Kull vibe to it. Two youngsters happen upon a mystical girl on one of their daily forays in the territory surrounding their home village located in the land of Deschemb. She tempts them with barely concealed lascivious overtures, and the enigmatic phrase “We shall all dance the Dance of the Rising, in the House of Schrias, on the Island of Skulls.”<br/>The two protagonists learn more about the mythological nature of the island and its nearest habitation, Rothollow, from the village wise woman or 'blender'. To say more about the plot will deprive you of your enjoyment reading it; but suffice it to say, when you reach the end-page and read the words 'to be continued' then you can be sure you'll want to buy the next issue on the strength of this story alone."" - from Amazon review of <i>Broadswords and Blasters</i> #1, where the story first appeared.</p>

""What’s a ghost to do when his lover is reborn in the same small town where they were killed so many years ago by the cult that controls it? What can he do when he sees her living her life, but his body is all razor blades and sharp ends? And what will happen if she ever wakes up to her life before?
More horror and urban fantasy, Spencer hits all the right notes of a could-be toxic relationship and how the real monster might be the last person you expect it to be. My biggest regret for this piece is that it isn’t a bit longer, doesn’t get a little more into the meat of the character, but all the rage and impotence of being able to see the world, of being close to a person you love without being able to fully be with them is well executed. If you are looking for a quick sharp jab of a story, Spencer has you covered."" - Matthew Gomez, editor at Broadswords and Blasters
""What sort of life can you lead if you and your lover have been sacrificed by an ancient cult? How about when your lover is reborn without the memories of her passing, and she unintentionally summons your spirit to hover in her wake? Matt Spencer explores the cycle of birth, death, rebirth, and vengeance in this short urban fantasy. This story engenders the right level of disjointed questioning on the part of the reader to really sink home the same sort of disjointed questioning in the narrator. He knows just as much as we do, which might be frustrating for some readers, but students of unreliable narrators should be okay. I'd like to see more of this couple, possibly in a series of linked stories or perhaps in a longer short story or novella."" - Cameron Mount, editor at Broadswords and Blasters
""Island of Skulls""
""This extended fantasy short story is a real treat. In my experience, good fantasy writing is difficult to achieve, one reason being that I'm always comparing such stories to the sheer inventiveness, masterful descriptions and original world building of Martin, Tolkien and Howard. But Matt Spencer comes close—extremely close. After just a few sentences, you are immersed in this world. People and place names sound like they 'fit', rich prose puts you in the scene with descriptions involving all 5 senses.The story has a Conan or King Kull vibe to it. Two youngsters happen upon a mystical girl on one of their daily forays in the territory surrounding their home village located in the land of Deschemb. She tempts them with barely concealed lascivious overtures, and the enigmatic phrase “We shall all dance the Dance of the Rising, in the House of Schrias, on the Island of Skulls.”The two protagonists learn more about the mythological nature of the island and its nearest habitation, Rothollow, from the village wise woman or 'blender'. To say more about the plot will deprive you of your enjoyment reading it; but suffice it to say, when you reach the end-page and read the words 'to be continued' then you can be sure you'll want to buy the next issue on the strength of this story alone."" - from Amazon review of Broadswords and Blasters #1, where the story first appeared.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute personally, hey, that's understandable. Times are tough. You could still do me a solid by spreading the word around to anyone who likes to kind of stories I have tell, thirsty for a fresh voice, who might have the spare cash to help make it happen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Hello, it's me.</h2>
<p>Hi. It's me, Brooks. I'm a writer. I love ideas and stories, which both feel the same, as they are most of the time marching through my mind space. </p>
<p>I've used this mighty handy part of myself (my mind space) doing standup comedy, (over thirty years), writing three popular books, <i>Clutter Busting,</i> and <i>Clutter Busting Your Life, </i>and <i>Better Late Than Dead!, a</i>s well as three television show pilots.</p>
<p>This campaign for <i>Brooksisms!</i> is important to me because I lovingly wrote this book to make fun of the human condition. I don't think there's anything better than writing humorously and drawing simple cartoons to illustrate and coalesce our amazing foibles, as well as our daring dos. I ""courageously"" use myself as the role model for both.</p>
<p>When you contribute towards <i>Brooksisms</i>! seeing the light of day, you help the world laugh at itself and take things more lightly. When we laugh at ourselves and the world, we create peace of mind. What a great thing to do! Think of this book as people's personal Jester that lightens the loads of their lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for <i>Brooksisms!</i> to see the light of day, I need you to help me raise $1490. Here's where the money is going:</p>
<p>1. $350 for editing, which involves trimming any excess, and helping make sure the stories are tight and communicating. The editor will also fix the multitudes of my grammar and spelling mistakes. (Hey, I heard George Lucas is terrible at both, too!)</p>
<p>2. $690 to pay for page layout and front and back cover design by the brilliant Colleen Sheehan from Write Dream Repeat Book Design. </p>
<p>3. $450 for copies of <i>Brooksisms!</i>. These will be sent out for publicity and marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Perks!</strong></p>
<p>A $25 contribution to my campaign will get you a signed copy of <i>Brooksisms! (Indiegogo will charge you a $7 shipping fee in the U.S.)</i></p>
<p>A $50 contribution to my campaign will get you a signed copy of <i>Brooksisms!</i>, as well as a special cartoon designed and drawn especially for you in the front of the book. <i>(Indiegogo will charge you a $7 shipping fee in the U.S.)</i></p>
<p>A $150 contribution will get you the signed copy of <i>Brooksisms!</i>, as well as the specially designed cartoon just for you, <strong>and </strong>an original 14"" x 17"" oil pastel painting by myself made especially for you. <i>(Indiegogo will charge you a $7 shipping fee in the U.S.)</i></p>
<p><i>A $200 contribution will </i>get you the signed copy of <i>Brooksisms!</i>, as well as a one-hour Skype Clutter Busting session in which I will help you find and remove the clutter in your home, office, or life. <i>(Indiegogo will charge you a $7 shipping fee in the U.S.)</i></p>
<p>If I don't reach the goal, the money will go into a savings account meant only for the purposes of publishing the book. As more funds come in from other sources, they will be combined and the book will come together that way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you contribute towards the editing, design, and marketing of <i>Brooksisms!</i> you help make my day! Imagine me jumping around smiling. (I actually do that when good things happen.) I love this book and I would love to see it come to life, and to be read and enjoyed by many, many people.</p>
<p>It's impossible to do things on our own. It takes many villages (at least 12) to make anything happen. I can't afford to make <i>Brooksisms!</i> happen on my own. Which it turns out is a good thing, because when I do something like this with your help, it's more fun! We're doing it together. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>It can be a noisy world. It takes a lot of work to get heard. First you have to hear yourself. It took me a long time to come up with these stories and cartoons. It often felt like mining for gems. A lot of stories and cartoons were rocks not diamonds and didn't make it into this collection. The ones that shone, did. Luckily I love mining!</p>
<p>The next step is to have the editors do their polishing. It's great to have their help. They can see the things I can't. I'll take what they recommend, and do one last edit of my own. I have the lust for stories carrying me through this long but fruitful process.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>I understand if you can't contribute financially towards <i>Brooksisms!</i> at this time. But if you can, I would love it if you would spread the word about my campaign to others. That would be a great gift to me and to my book. Thanks!</div></div>","Hello, it's me.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Azania is a speculative science fiction novel based in a parallel(?) African dimension. The characters are modern, edgy and African. This project has been a year in the making and now we seek your help to make it complete.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you may have noticed, we are seeking to raise 5000 USD to make this project an overwhelming success worldwide. </p>
<p>About 3500USD will go directly into the publishing costs which will be about 500 books in total.</p>
<p>1500 of the funds raised will go towards the media campaign as this is a self-published, crowdfunded project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Azania is book 2 of the Mashu oMusha series. Seeing the impact of the first book motivated me to reprint it and also to work on this second book. Africans, young and old, have been thirsty for stories told from their point of view and even in their language. Azania uses a hybrid of Zulu and English to give Africans higher dreams. The talks and panels I have been a part of have shown that work like this is truly needed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As Afrofuturism as a movement grows, it becomes hard to separate the real from the fake. As an African in particular, I find myself wading through mountains of American content when researching the subject. But Azania is true Afrofutirism. It is high speculative Science Fiction literature and needs support to make it through the interfering noise. Your support would make the difference.</p>

<p>Last year, I set out to identify a media platform dedicated to telling the story of under-served African startups. A platform that they can call their home. One they can use to identify and leverage opportunities for funding, mentorship, reaching out to new customers and users. Unfortunately, I failed to identify any.</p>
<p>As it is currently, it is hard for African startups - especially the homebred - to get publicity from mainstream media such as radio, TV, and newspapers. It is only startups that win a competition or raise a round of funding that may stand a chance. The other category is that of startups that can afford to pay for the service. Or, those that know an editor, producer or someone influential at a media house.</p>
<p>But, the question remains; How about those that do not know anyone? Those that don't have the money? Where should they go? Who will tell their story?</p>
<p>Because media is a very critical catalyst in UNLOCKING opportunities for startups. Especially those struggling to raise funding or get mentorship.</p>
<p>That's why, on the 1st of March 2017, I decided to launch Startup Digest Africa. Since then, I am happy to say that we have been able to UNLOCK some opportunities for the startups we have featured.</p>
<p>In 7 months, over 10 angel investors have contacted us from within and outside Africa about the featured startups. We have also got requests to help with identifying more startups. This made us realize that there is a lot of untapped opportunities for African startups that do not get to media.</p>
<p>That is why, as Startup Digest Africa, we decided to be the HOME &amp; VOICE for African startups. Especially those that are currently under-served. Yet, with the current financial resources, we are unable to achieve this at scale.</p>
<p>This is why we have launched a crowdfunding campaign. We are seeking to raise $25,000 by close of 2017. This will enable us to tell more stories of African startups throughout 2018.</p>
<p>We need your financial support, however small. Even though you are unable to contribute, you can help us spread the word by sharing this.</p>
<p>Uganda is among the under-served startup ecosystems on the continent. Thus, the funds will go towards helping us tell more stories of startups in Uganda by covering regions beyond Kampala. We will also carry out a comprehensive survey of the funding landscape in the country, compile an exhaustive database of startups in the country, as well as carry out a survey of all the stakeholders in the Ugandan startup ecosystem.</p>

& Travel…!
I am Zara Chan, an architectural designer from Hong
Kong.  Travelling has always been my best
part of life.  Apart from going to a new
place and see new things, I also enjoy meeting new people and share my
life.  Therefore a lot of time I prefer
travelling for a long period: to visit places apart from famous tourist spot;
to enjoy both cityscape and nature; to meet local people and to have a taste of
living a life that they are living.
So, I want to record all my experience, feelings, and
also my travelling tips through the media of photobooks.  This is not only a record, but also a sharing
for all of you who love travelling as much as I do.
The Campaign was set up to raise fund for my
publication of the travel photobook series, Set Sail & Travel, and most
importantly, for my upcoming trip to Italy. 

Rock the
Rockies – My first book
The first travel photobook would be recording my previous 3-week
trip to Canada – mainly to the Rockies.  The book is structured with time and place sequence:
The adventure was recorded by passages and photos:
Useful tips provided especially for transportation if you are
planning to go, also some side topics related to the places found during the
trip or when I did my research before head.
If you are worried about the content of the book, you can check them
out first at http://setsailandtravel.blogspot.hk/ (ongoing update) or from our facebook
site Set Sail n travel
The content would be more or less the same but you would certainly
get more passages, photos and tips in the book.
Next stop – Italy

After the trip to Canada, I am planning a
2-month trip to Italy, which would be in June 2015, and I would do the same
sharing through writing another travel book. 
I need your support on the trip and the publication of the books.RewardsShipping is not included. The exact amount of shipping fee would be advise later.Hidden

<h3><u>Why?</u></h3>Over the years I have fitted thousands of shoes on little feet. I know what is needed, and I also know that many parents are not being properly advised in lots of shoe shops – even some of those <i>well-known</i> shops that offer a fitting service. Parents frequently come in with their children wearing shoes bought elsewhere and ask me to check them. Quite frankly some of the fittings I have seen have been <b>shocking</b>. Those kids must be so uncomfortable in their shoes – wouldn't your feet be sore if you were in one or even two sizes too small and the wrong width? It happens, believe me. I am not on a crusade, I won't be naming brands or retail outlets and I am not looking to discredit anyone, but I believe every parent has the <b>right</b> to make the correct choice of footwear for their child. Many parents genuinely have not got a clue what to look for – and why should they? That’s why they go to proper shoe shops, isn’t it? But unfortunately you cannot rely on the advice that many staff, retailers and manufacturers offer. Granted, they are in business to make money, but that doesn’t mean that what they say and do is right. Follow the advice in this guide and you will have a clearer understanding of how to choose shoes to give your child healthy feet for life.<br/>

<h3>О проекте</h3>
<p>Сколько себя помню, я собираю и пересказываю всевозможные забавные житейские истории, да и со мной они регулярно случаются. Ну, и сочиняю, конечно. Прошло уже много лет с тех пор, как я опубликовал в интернете первую из них. За эти годы было создано и закрыто несколько блогов, что-то расползлось по сети, что-то сгинуло в недрах архивов. Это - наиболее полное собрание моих нелитературных сочинений.</p>
<p>Этот сборник - ответ сразу на несколько вопросов:</p>
<p>- Где почитать все?</p>
<p>- Как там было в истории про этого... ну, который...?</p>
<p>- Я это как-то пропустил /а. Где можно почитать?</p>
<p>- Мне срочно нужны десять минут здорового смеха. Расскажешь что-нибудь?</p>
<p>- Когда следующая книга? (Тут важно подчеркнуть, что книга с литературными произведениями тоже выйдет в этом году, но с ""#Мемориз"", кроме автора и иллюстратора, у нее ничего общего не будет)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Где почитать отрывки для ознакомления?</h3>

<h3>Почему краудфанд?</h3>
<p>Создание книги стоит денег - верстка, вычитка, корректура, оформление, печать и прочее.</p>
<p>Типичная ошибка современного автора - сначала издать книгу за свой счет, а потом уже искать, куда бы ее пристроить. Кроме того, не каждый, кто во время подготовки уверяет, что собирается купить книгу, действительно ее покупает. Предзаказ решает все эти проблемы.</p>
<p>Поскольку это уже не первый такой проект, можно довольно точно предсказать, сколько денег на что пойдет. Я планировал бюджет с небольшим запасом на всякие непредвиденные случаи (изменение тарифов издательства и типографии, падение валют, переход в другое издательство и т.д.).</p>
<p>Для выхода печатной книги понадобится порядка $1500. В цели кампейна указана $500, т.к. часть денег поступит напрямую от тех, кто не хочет или не может использовать Indiegogo и электронные кошельки.<br/><br/>Это сумма не покрывает дерзкого намерения снабдить каждую из более, чем сотни историй, небольшой иллюстрацией-комиксом в том же стиле, что и заглавная картинка кампейна. Чтобы осуществить эту мечту хотя бы частично, в предзаказы добавлена опция ""Покровитель искусств"", позволяющая спонсировать создание одной иллюстрации. На сколько грантов хватит - столько и оформим.</p>
<p>Грант не предусматривает для спонсора возможности вмешиваться в работу иллюстратора, но его замечания о том, что именно и как именно иллюстрировать, будут, где это возможно, приняты к сведению. Сумма гранта покрывает только создание картинки и 1-2 незначительных правки(обычно больше и не требуется, иллюстратор надежный), но никак не переделку или долгие споры о деталях и исполнении . Во избежание лишних споров, никакой привязки картинок к конкретным грантам не будет.</p>
<p>Все, что останется после издательских расходов, будет распределено следующим образом:</p>
<p>- если останется $1500 и более - проиллюстрировано будет всё</p>
<p>- остаток будет поделен между автором и героями историй. Возможно, нам даже хватит на мороженое.</p>
<p>Публикация будет проходить в 3 этапа.</p>
<p>1. Официальная презентация с раздачей книг</p>
<p>2. Рассылка экземпляров (включая электронные) тем, кто воспользуется привилегированными перками:</p>
<p>- Покровитель искусств</p>
<p>- Спонсор</p>
<p>3. Рассылка оставшихся экземпляров и размещение электронной версии в онлайн-магазинах</p>
<p>Между этапами может пройти несколько дней.</p>
<h3>Если вдруг не наберется достаточно</h3>
<p>На создание электронной версии хватит порядка $200. Если наберется больше этой суммы - все получат по электронной версии.<br/><br/>Для заказавших бумажные экземпляры в этом случае предусмотрены три варианта:</p>
<p>- полный возврат денег за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем</p>
<p>- электронный вариант и возврат оставшейся суммы за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем</p>
<p>- переоформить как заказ моей следующей книги, которая близка к завершению и гарантированно увидит свет. К сожалению, привелегированные заказы перенести не получится. Разница будет возвращена за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем</p>

Сколько себя помню, я собираю и пересказываю всевозможные забавные житейские истории, да и со мной они регулярно случаются. Ну, и сочиняю, конечно. Прошло уже много лет с тех пор, как я опубликовал в интернете первую из них. За эти годы было создано и закрыто несколько блогов, что-то расползлось по сети, что-то сгинуло в недрах архивов. Это - наиболее полное собрание моих нелитературных сочинений.
Этот сборник - ответ сразу на несколько вопросов:
- Где почитать все?
- Как там было в истории про этого... ну, который...?
- Я это как-то пропустил /а. Где можно почитать?
- Мне срочно нужны десять минут здорового смеха. Расскажешь что-нибудь?
- Когда следующая книга? (Тут важно подчеркнуть, что книга с литературными произведениями тоже выйдет в этом году, но с ""#Мемориз"", кроме автора и иллюстратора, у нее ничего общего не будет)
 
Где почитать отрывки для ознакомления?

Почему краудфанд?
Создание книги стоит денег - верстка, вычитка, корректура, оформление, печать и прочее.
Типичная ошибка современного автора - сначала издать книгу за свой счет, а потом уже искать, куда бы ее пристроить. Кроме того, не каждый, кто во время подготовки уверяет, что собирается купить книгу, действительно ее покупает. Предзаказ решает все эти проблемы.
Поскольку это уже не первый такой проект, можно довольно точно предсказать, сколько денег на что пойдет. Я планировал бюджет с небольшим запасом на всякие непредвиденные случаи (изменение тарифов издательства и типографии, падение валют, переход в другое издательство и т.д.).
Для выхода печатной книги понадобится порядка $1500. В цели кампейна указана $500, т.к. часть денег поступит напрямую от тех, кто не хочет или не может использовать Indiegogo и электронные кошельки.Это сумма не покрывает дерзкого намерения снабдить каждую из более, чем сотни историй, небольшой иллюстрацией-комиксом в том же стиле, что и заглавная картинка кампейна. Чтобы осуществить эту мечту хотя бы частично, в предзаказы добавлена опция ""Покровитель искусств"", позволяющая спонсировать создание одной иллюстрации. На сколько грантов хватит - столько и оформим.
Грант не предусматривает для спонсора возможности вмешиваться в работу иллюстратора, но его замечания о том, что именно и как именно иллюстрировать, будут, где это возможно, приняты к сведению. Сумма гранта покрывает только создание картинки и 1-2 незначительных правки(обычно больше и не требуется, иллюстратор надежный), но никак не переделку или долгие споры о деталях и исполнении . Во избежание лишних споров, никакой привязки картинок к конкретным грантам не будет.
Все, что останется после издательских расходов, будет распределено следующим образом:
- если останется $1500 и более - проиллюстрировано будет всё
- остаток будет поделен между автором и героями историй. Возможно, нам даже хватит на мороженое.
Публикация будет проходить в 3 этапа.
1. Официальная презентация с раздачей книг
2. Рассылка экземпляров (включая электронные) тем, кто воспользуется привилегированными перками:
- Покровитель искусств
- Спонсор
3. Рассылка оставшихся экземпляров и размещение электронной версии в онлайн-магазинах
Между этапами может пройти несколько дней.
Если вдруг не наберется достаточно
На создание электронной версии хватит порядка $200. Если наберется больше этой суммы - все получат по электронной версии.Для заказавших бумажные экземпляры в этом случае предусмотрены три варианта:
- полный возврат денег за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем
- электронный вариант и возврат оставшейся суммы за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем
- переоформить как заказ моей следующей книги, которая близка к завершению и гарантированно увидит свет. К сожалению, привелегированные заказы перенести не получится. Разница будет возвращена за вычетом процентов Idiegogo и платежных систем

<h3>FROM FIELD TO FIELD</h3>
<p>The BOOK offers architectural, urban planning and spatial IDEAS and SOLUTIONS which support the realisation of BETTER LIVING CONDITIONS for REFUGEES. We aim to INSPIRE and ENCOURAGE architects, urban planners and stakeholders to action; outline the NEEDS and POSSIBILITIES on offer; and bring TOGETHER all stakeholders, providing alternative spatial solutions, better infrastructure and more livable spaces for refugees. </p>
<p>EXPERTS from the field of ARCHITECTURE and URBAN PLANNING will SHARE their extensive EXPERIENCE on everything from organising a UNHCR refugee camp in Jordan to developing a communal space and community in Greece. The BOOK includes PRACTICAL INFO on topics like organising conferences, documenting and sharing knowledge, evaluation of past projects and positive feedback, developing projects in the present and formulating future interventions and strategies, educating students, how to act on site, how to map refugee settlements, … and not only HOW? but also WHY? And WHAT? </p>
<p>Bringing KNOWLEDGE and PRACTICAL experience TOGETHER as a basis for further developments means that we don’t always have to start from zero. Rather we use the experience and KNOW-HOW gained from previous successful interventions which can be SCALED and ADAPTED to provide EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS in other contexts. We create a KNOWLEDGE HUB and a PLATFORM for DISCUSSION between the different STAKEHOLDER GROUPS, encouraging more and more architects and urban planners to be active and to develop new strategies and solutions.</p>

<h3>IMAGINE...</h3>
<p>Can YOU imagine having to FLEE your home, your land, your country or even your own continent in order to SURVIVE and PROTECT your family? There are currently around sixty-five million refugees across the world who have had to do just this (UNHCR – June 2016). And then having made the long journey to SAFETY, imagine finding yourself in a refugee camp or settlement with very basic and inadequate facilities, services and infrastructure. Many refugees end up in just this situation, living in refugee camps and settlements which further compound their suffering. They are often left in limbo in these situations, for around seventeen years on average.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>ARCHITECTURE FOR REFUGEES - WHAT WE DO</h3>
<p>Architecture for Refugees provides an informational platform, educational resources, projects and collaborations which link refugees, refugee settlements and camps with architects, urban planners and designers, NGOs, government and UN agencies, refugee host communities and social and grassroots organisations. </p>
<p>By facilitating collaboration between the different stakeholders in each case, by directly involving refugees in these processes and by harnessing and sharing innovative solutions, approaches and intervention models we aim to improve facilities, infrastructure and living conditions for refugees across the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>KNOWLEDGE IS POWER</h3>
<p>The key to our approach and mission is through the SHARING of KNOWLEDGE and expertise which EMPOWERS and inspires CHANGE. </p>
<p>Architecture for Refugees is compiling this From Field to Field BOOK as an overview and guide, sharing information and experiences of different refugee contexts, projects, responses, intervention models, strategies, approaches and collaborations as well as experiences and perspectives from refugees themselves. </p>
<p>Through this project we aim to INCREASE AWARENESS both of existing refugee situations and also of the range of POSSIBLE OPTIONS and INTERVENTIONS which are available and which can be ADAPTED and APPLIED in each particular case and context. </p>
<p>This information and global knowledge exchange and transfer is crucial in CATALYSING further ACTION and improving our response capacity, especially in contexts of LIMITED RESOURCES. This book outlines different architectural, urban planning and design aspects, BEST PRACTICES, ideas and intervention strategies for improving and developing refugee settlements. </p>
<p>We are collecting the KNOW-HOW, compiling experiences from a diverse range of organisations, academics, architects, NGOs, refugees and representatives of government and international agencies in order to provide a broad and comprehensive range of perspectives and visions. The BOOK will be PUBLISHED OFFLINE and ONLINE in order to maximise diffusion of the information and we hope that it is the spark for further involvement and actions from architects and the general public as well as from the diverse range of stakeholders already involved.</p>
</div><h3>BRINGING US TOGETHER</h3><p>We invited PROFESSIONALS from a range of different FIELDS of expertise and organisations as well as seeking EXPERIENCES and PERSPECTIVES from refugees. The book introduces their approaches, projects and EVALUATES the effectiveness of the intervention strategies and their advantages and disadvantages. What can we LEARN from the PAST and PRESENT and how can we DEVELOP and build better SOLUTIONS TOGETHER? </p><p>The book HIGHLIGHTS the diversity of architectural and urban planning responses to the refugee crisis and compiles PERSPECTIVES from different STAKEHOLDERS and a range of APPROACHES. From shelter projects to community spaces to large refugee camps, the book discusses, details and analyses the practical efficacy of interventions in diverse countries on different continents as well as including perspectives and strategies from conferences, discussions, exhibitions, workshops, research, participatory processes, inclusive social projects and short and long-term projects. </p><p>This knowledge TOOLKIT provides EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION MODELS and strategies, project monitoring, best practices and practical examples of diverse and complex problems with diverse and complex answers and solutions. Collaboration with partners in this book allows for collective development of improved short and long-term strategies. </p><p>We believe that introducing and contrasting different approaches can encourage architects and urban planners to actively collaborate with development of infrastructure for refugees. Together we can share better and more sustainable solutions!</p><h3>BE PART OF SOMETHING SPECIAL!</h3><p>Your contribution can make a big difference to making the book a success and to improving the lives of refugees around the world. </p><p>There are a range of amounts which you can contribute and which will support the publication of the book. Depending on your contribution, in addition to the book itself, you will also receive other thank you items in recognition of your kind support. </p><p>We would also be very grateful if you could share this campaign on social media (facebook - twitter) and with any organisations who might like to contribute to or support the project or get involved. By supporting the compilation and publication of the book you will also be contributing to the long-term work of Architecture for Refugees in support of refugees. </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for your kindness and solidarity, sincerely,</p><h3>THE TEAM - ARCHITECTURE FOR REFUGEES</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483905993/f9eicqwhhp1essknosy4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Dennise Castillo, Nasr Chamma, Michael Evans, Zsófia Glatz and Bence Komlósi</p><p><a href=""http://www.architectureforrefugees.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.architectureforrefugees.com</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Architecture-for-Refugees-111099509256699/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> - <a href=""https://twitter.com/a4refugees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a></p><p><a href=""http://architectureforrefugees.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d38c7770def6918ea652a0e4f&amp;id=34a485d4d1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">For our NEWSLETTER click HERE!</a></p></div>","WELCOME

<li>not being able to draw,</li>
<li>not having contacts in the animation industry</li>
<li>not being Japanese</li>
<li>not having millions of dollars</li>
</ul><p>... that not only can I not make an anime. I don't want to make one anymore.  </p><p>You see along the way I learned some important lessons about how anime comes to life. Anime is created by wealthy companies in Japan (and increasingly elsewhere) coming together to form a Production Committee. That committee spends millions of dollars often to create even one season of high quality animation that is viewed and licensed globally. The chances of getting your concept or short animation funded and produced this way are slim to none. Even if you are picked up your creativity suffers because your storytelling is limited by your budget. How many animes never see a season 2? What happened to the story? How poorly are animators and others paid to produce the works we love? Why is there such hatred for anything inspired by anime that is not from Japan? How does legal and illegal streaming affect traditional economic models for anime?</p><p>I had these questions on my mind when I launched the trailer for MultiFacet (<a href=""http://www.themultifacet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.themultifacet.com</a>) in the fall of 2016 but the number one question people asked me was ""when is the series coming out?""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485963998/ykvkeckg4fonur2e73ne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I grew frustrated and tired of trying to explain the realities of being an independent who put every penny and moment of time they had for seconds of animation.

What if I can't fund during the campaign?</h3><p>Each of Rydin's Reflections will take a maximum of 1100 people (3300 total). So if there are spots left at the end, I will keep this page going as an Indiegogo In-Demand page (same page just no time-limits and assuming we hit our listed goal) where you can still join a Reflection and start your 60 day period in the private platform for $34.</p><p>So join when you can. However, as life goes the earlier you join something emerging that more you get that feeling of being part of something at the ground floor and get to shape it. Also I am keeping the numbers manageable so their can be a real community experience. It's why it is capped and in a closed networks. Too often people just see dollar signs and forget about the individuals. Not happening here because I need more than your money, I need your brilliance. I take that seriously.</p><p>Who knows what this looks like next year...</p><h3>Question.Who is on your team?</h3><p>I have a core team around me of animators, thinkers, writers, and just great people who have helped me for years. But I am a lot to deal with on my own. So to protect their time and sanity and my current working relationships (won't be asking them to work for free), they will be introduced to anyone who is part of this project and wants to grow with it by collaborating inside the Workplace by Facebook Platform for MultiFacet. </p><h3>Question. Why can't the collaboration be free?</h3><p>So as a Creator I see the world of content, intellectual property, and collaboration evolving. We live in a world of fanfics, remixes, and multiple interpretations. Yet that needs to be balanced with the very real need of creators and producers who literally spend each and every minute (yes even while sleeping) and dollar trying to bring something to life. </p><p>So by putting this project inside a place that is not free to join, I sort of get to find out who wants to struggle through this as I have. It also allows me to keep a level of concentration on this new concept instead of being scattered all throughout social media where attention is so fragmented. I am so serious that when this campaign is over I will be limiting my activities exclusively to the new community, and not engaging on social media anymore.</p><p>One of the advantages of not being a giant corporation is that while I want to make money, I am not solely motivated by shareholders. There is a world of creative people out there who if you treat them fairly and compensate them can do amazing things. We will be creating guidelines around the community to navigate these issues, and by we I mean you as well.

Make an anime.Reflecting on four years of trial and error l have accepted that when you start from a position of.... 
not being able to draw,
not having contacts in the animation industry
not being Japanese
not having millions of dollars
... that not only can I not make an anime. I don't want to make one anymore.  You see along the way I learned some important lessons about how anime comes to life. Anime is created by wealthy companies in Japan (and increasingly elsewhere) coming together to form a Production Committee. That committee spends millions of dollars often to create even one season of high quality animation that is viewed and licensed globally. The chances of getting your concept or short animation funded and produced this way are slim to none. Even if you are picked up your creativity suffers because your storytelling is limited by your budget. How many animes never see a season 2? What happened to the story? How poorly are animators and others paid to produce the works we love? Why is there such hatred for anything inspired by anime that is not from Japan? How does legal and illegal streaming affect traditional economic models for anime?I had these questions on my mind when I launched the trailer for MultiFacet (www.themultifacet.com) in the fall of 2016 but the number one question people asked me was ""when is the series coming out?""I grew frustrated and tired of trying to explain the realities of being an independent who put every penny and moment of time they had for seconds of animation. For months I wallowed in the frustration of not seeing a path forward. I didn't have the resources to even produce another high quality trailer let alone a series.In English ""Nadir"" means to be at the lowest point of something.

Confessions have been around for almost 96 years and are still a favorite among many readers. I would like to once again, tap into this forgotten genre market. However, this time around I would like to not only publish the stories as a single ebook, but I would like to also publish confessions in paperback format. Chicken Soup). In order to do this, I will need around $10,000 to start-up. The monies will be used to pay Editors, Graphic Designers, Marketing, Advances, and printing.  It will also give Authors a place to showcase their work. They can write as many stories as they would like.  Even if, I do not reach my goal of $10,000.

<h3>THE ALIEN THEMED TAROT CARD DECK</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580650421/copieimahrklhidfz1n6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Why support Inspiring Alien Tarot?</p>
<p>This is an alien themed tarot deck and guidebook set for starseeds, highly sensitive people and those who love colorful art as well as tarot collectors.</p>
<p>If you care about the quality of your tarot decks, this is the campaign to support!</p>
<p>Also if you care about the specialness and uniqueness of your tarot decks and want to support and independent artist, deck creator, tarot reader and a small business owner, this is the campaign to support.</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Alvia Crescens and I've grown up in an average family in an average town, not too many privileges and even less so as I've grown up and discovered who I really was all along. I'm a professional artist and tarot reader with a determinate spirit, so where I've lacked I've always made up in my existing resources. I'm an artschool graduate and this began in the time I attended artschool and did my degree work as I was also getting deeper into tarot.</li>
<li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580651048/tplju4ron6gqlwl80uz6.png"" src=""""/></li>
<li>This campaign celebrates the 3 year journey that the Inspiring Alien Tarot deck and upcoming guidebook has travelled so far - it has desired to be spread wider, so I shall respect its' (and YOUR) wishes to do so. This is the <strong>MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN!</strong> This deck has 11 reviews, all 5 stars which you can find here: <a href=""https://inspiringalien.wixsite.com/inspiringalien/inspiring-alien-tarot-deck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://inspiringalien.wixsite.com/inspiringali...</a> </li>
<li>Spreading it wider, however, means that it will need more funding. While my family background is certainly not the richest nor poorest, they cannot support me forever nor can they whip up a few 10s of grands to support my business with these decks. That should be obvious, but as there are some that this is not obvious to, I had to say that.  Ultimately, the funding will allow the deck to reach wider as well as me to live a more fulfilling lifestyle. Therefore this campaign does play a large role in my professional growth as well.</li>
<li>To be upfront, my journey so far with selling the collectors edition with less funds has not been easy - <strong>I had to learn the hard way</strong> on how to properly price the deck in which I was discounting on my talent as well as how to work around the expenses as I didn't want to<i> discount the quality</i> as well. I often had to buy individual decks before I was able to do the box designs and ship them to buyers, making the process very slow and even more expensive to me. I want to finally do it better and gather the funds first so that the production and shipping can go so much more smoothly and effortlessly, and to actually make some money from my craft instead of sacrificing my financial wellbeing for doing what I love.</li>
<li><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581345479/igd5fdhhyviz1tmnuhhk.png"" src=""""/></li>
<li>When the necessary funds have been gathered, the larger scale production will be begin and this will help more people to enjoy hand made artwork in form of tarot cards that are printed in a quality <strong>cardstock of 350gsm, foiled mint green edges </strong>and a beautiful box that fits the A5 guidebook which has <i>coloured imagery</i>. When you think about the full effect in practical terms, in my personal life, this will allow me to keep creating for a living, have more quality in my life, and build my business by outsourcing tasks that don't bring me joy and lessen my workload (this does not mean i'm going to turn lazy - it means i'm able to work smarter and not harder without sacrificing the results).</li>

<p>This deck will thus reach its' full circle from being a collectors piece of an artwork, an only 100 copies printed limited edition, to a wider spread amazing quality tarot readers edition divination tool. I'll also be able to print more guidebooks and decks at once so that I can cut down on production costs.

<p>I left etsy for ethical reasons - they were being unreasonable for international sellers, and have since sold it on my online store, which I do have to pay more for but at least I don't have to support a platform that doesn't reflect my values.</p>
<p>Also, this deck will not be sold to traditional publishers such as LoScarabeo, Llewellyn, Hay House.. I have my reasons not to do this and so to assure you that this deck will be at it's cheapest right now with this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE GOALS, IN MONEY TERMS</h3>
<p>So here's the raw numerical aspect of producing this quantity of decks and guidebooks.</p>
<ul>
<li>To print out +1000 copies we'll need at least 12598$, for the guidebooks to limited editions 4700$, limited edition decks (50 copies) 1160$. We'll also need to pay 24% taxes for the Finnish government - let's not forget that!</li>
<li>This will total out production costs to 18458$ + 4429,92$ taxes = 22877,92$. To minimise any losses we raise this goal to 35000$, that way money won't be an issue in case something happens. Indiegogo will also hold a little percentage of this money for possible refunds and cancellations.</li>
<li>Then we consider profit - because we all deserve to be paid. Especially when ""we"" is just one person, me, Alvia. If there's no problems in the production and aftermath of that, I already have about 13000$ according to these calculations - however, I'd like to put that money onto quicker delivery. I also want to pay myself 15000$ on top of that as I've barely made any money on my decks previously because of my lack of business knowledge and pricing the deck very low in the beginning. I want to reward myself for making this far with this deck that truly came from my heart and having it reach yours as well. Some of the profit will go back into production such as quicker delivery, so the more we make, the quicker you'll receive the deck!</li>
<li>Lastly, I want to give back, so per each backer I'm giving 3$ as donations - 1$ for a charity (likely human rights, environments, poverty etc), 1$ for my family and 1$ for holding an Alien Party I wanna gift to my in person friends. I've thought that this Alien Party might even end up being an art show at the same time.</li>
<li>In case we don't get to 50000$, we'll print out as much as we can with the funds. I'm also opting in for the InDemand service to keep raising the funds after - that way the production would be delayed but it will still happen! Keep this in mind - the quicker the money gets raised, the quicker the decks will be delivered.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p><strong>How will this campaign impact the creator?</strong></p>
<p>This campaign will give me a much needed fresh start financially - you'll be supporting an independent artist, business owner and tarot reader.</p>
<p>Someone who's done it all on their own so far.</p>
<p>Someone who loves creating artwork, decks, youtube videos, creating in general.</p>
<p>You're giving me a chance to enjoy the fruits of my labour as well as put my money into what truly matters to me, such as ethical sourcing and offering workplaces for freelancers and those who want to help small businesses run their show.</p>
<p>This campaign will ripple into so many things other than decks and artwork. </p>
<p>This will mark my first successful campaign and prepare me for the following ones to come - not only will I learn a lot, but I'll also feel a sense of achievement like NEVER BEFORE. It's satisfying!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how it can possibly impact YOU:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your decks will be beautifully produced and amazing quality - cardstock matters to me way too much. For the collectors edition, you'll receive a hand decorated product signed and numbered - you'll literally hold a piece of art in your hands.</li>
<li>You'll be updated throughout the campaign on what's happening with the book, decks and other designs as well as my life.</li>
<li>You'll allow so many tarot readers across the globe to receive this deck at less of an investment and not having to worry about the preciousness of the collectors edition. There's also a fantastic guidebook packed with information about starseeds, astrology, numerology and the reasons for my artistic choices. </li>
<li>You can dive into the world of the inspiring little aliens - these aliens surprise you with their depth and love found in the vast cosmos. Many people feel drawn to this deck due to it's color and cuteness, but feel surprised of how mature and empowering these aliens can be. As a creator, they get even more straightforward with me and they directly connect to my higher self and starseed guides.</li>
</ul>

<h3>RISKS</h3>
<p>This is my first campaign on crowdfunding and I've only done things the hard way by being self-resourceful with little funding, from my own pocket... So how can we combat the risks?</p>
<ul>
<li>I know what it takes to put my work out there and I'm more and more knowledgeable of marketing and business at this point so I'll work my butt off to spread the word - and your help with this is BEYOND appreciated so keep sharing! <strong>If you've helped me share this - thank you to the moon and back!!</strong>
</li>
<li>In the case of funding being unsuccessful, I'll keep running the campaign and promoting it as well as keep you updated on what happens to the deck - I've explained to you above, where the funds go, so the more we raise the more we can produce.</li>
<li>The last and <strong>most likely risk</strong> is production and shipping delays - this is very real and has happened to many other deck creators before, so I want you to keep this in mind as you choose to back.</li>
