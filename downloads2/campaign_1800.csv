<div>Why, you ask?<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>It is important that my campaign get funded because I have and  continue to work on progressing my performance career. But there is only so  far I can go with no agent, no manager, and little access. <br/> But with a SAG-AFTRA membership, I get access to castings, events, and  other resources to perfect my craft and make new connections for more work  with good wages.

Why, you ask?


It is important that my campaign get funded because I have and  continue to work on progressing my performance career. But there is only so  far I can go with no agent, no manager, and little access.  But with a SAG-AFTRA membership, I get access to castings, events, and  other resources to perfect my craft and make new connections for more work  with good wages. Being a Union member tells the world that you are serious  about going to the next level. With that access, I plan to use the opportunity to promote great causes  that I believe in- youth, education, art, culture, and connecting people to  resources.
My funders can virtually come along for the ride. Instead of a  tech project for instance, where it comes to market and that's it, with me  you can see the progress I will continue to make as time continues and I  will share the experience with my supporters- events, live tweets,  broadcasts, etc.see full story: www.leslieolabisi.com/currentprojects

<p><b>Check out our Gallery Page to see some images! </b></p>
<p> <span>Hosted by <i>Floating
Lotus</i>, <b>EVOLUTION</b> examines the
undeniable growth and transformation that often follows in the aftermath of
both internal and external, public and private destruction. Contemplation of
this universal, natural law of the universe allows for the continued, ever changing
cycle of death &amp; birth, with the surrendering away of the old and clearing space
for the new.  Change. </span></p>
<p>This Installation invites the viewer to
contemplate their own feelings surrounding destruction and expansion. By
pairing art with sensory aligning modalities such as music, physical movement,
aromatherapy, related pieces of writing, and first hand personal stories of
growth, this installation will carve out space for the viewer to experience a
guided multidimensional sensory experience, and confront the related and
changing nature of their own Mind, Body, &amp; Spirit, for a full spectrum,
integrative, transformational experience. </p>
<p>Amanda Shafran’s surrealist, figurative
paintings are inspired by the relationship between the anatomy of the body and
the anatomy found in all forms of nature. Amanda, an artist, costume designer, and Fibromyalgia survivor, realized
during the healing process that the act of mapping her body in a sketchbook
allowed a visual and mental, neuroplastic relationship to develop between her
anatomy, and the naturally occurring patterns found in all forms of life. </p>
<p>Now for the second time Amanda has a
chance to show her work. This is installation is aimed at empowering men &amp;
women to reflect on their own stories, and unapologetically face the wisdom
within themselves. By sharing our stories, we heal universal wounds. </p>

<p>HI!
I’m Amanda Shafran. </p>
<p>I’m an international costume designer, yogi, and
artist living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, with my amazing husband of
six years.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Long Island, NY, though
I've always been a city girl at heart. I love art, nature, history, yoga, and a
good conversation. In college I studied English and Theater. I went on to pursue the language of clothes and
construction while getting an M.F.A. in Design for Stage and Film at NYU's
Tisch School of the Arts, with a concentration in costume design. There, I
spent three years studying illustration, fashion history, clothing
construction, drawing &amp; painting, and dramaturgy. I learned how to channel
the technical language of color, form, shape, and texture through the lens of a
story. </p>
<p>After graduating, A series of assistantships
directly after earning my M.F.A prepared me to stand on my own two feet as a
designer, but my body began to quickly deteriorate with the hard physical
demands of carrying heavy bags of fabric around the clock, while under the
tense constriction of unrelenting stress.</p>
<p>It was at this point I
learned that I also have Fibromyalgia and PTSD, two complicated neurological
and mind/ body disorders that simply didn’t fit into my otherwise on track
lifestyle or life plan. </p>
<p>My
mind wanted to keep working at warp speed, however I couldn’t change the hard
facts of my body. I decided to invest in myself. Somehow, this ended up in
finding a way to use my skills with color, form, shape, and texture as a lens
to communicate my own story. I devoted everything I had to self-care,
ultimately finding healing in a combination of hands on massage treatments,
acupuncture, Yoga, Meditation, medication, and journaling to be the ultimate
aid on both a physical, psychological, and spiritual level. (And A LOT of
therapy!)</p>
<p>Now,
in addition to theatrical design, I create drawings and paintings as a lens
into my story, with the aim of empowering other women and men to take ownership
of and love their own personal minds, bodies, and spirits. I also share what I
have learned by teaching private, group, and corporate Yoga &amp; Meditation. </p>

</p><p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, we're Sundress Publications, and we're in the process of building a new barn at Firefly Farms, our forty-five acre instructional, residency, and outreach center. Much of the equipment we have for our visiting artists and staff—including a drafting table, antique letterpress, and specialized tools—must share space with livestock feeds and farm equipment in our basement. This barn will allow us to reclaim the space and transform it from a general-purpose storage area to a workspace for visiting artists and writers.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And now, a political advertisement from Jayne the Donkey:</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It's that time again,
where the best and brightest of our country come together to talk
about the important issues that affect all American citizens in order
to move our nation forward. Where the unbiased media discusses and
weighs the best ideas and informs us, the citizens, who we could
democratically elect for our next leader.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>JUST KIDDING!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's time for a bunch of
grown human beings—let's be honest, mostly straight white males—to
yell at one another on stage! It's time for gaffes, sound bites, and
the general denigration of social progress!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why not just skip to
the chase and vote for a REAL jackass this election season?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's right. Jayne, the
<a href=""http://www.sundressacademyforthearts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sundress Academy for the Arts</a> donkey, is throwing his hilarious donkey-sized hat into the
ring to be the new leader of the free world.  Because he's an ass,
but an ass you can trust!<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445374744/xreyewcvrrrqieth9xzh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>What We Need and What
You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get Jayne's
political career started, we need to construct his campaign
headquarters, a 
</p>
<p>16' x 32' barn that will
shelter him and his herd through the silly season and right into the
primaries! With plenty of covered seating for Jayne and his staff of
six sheep and a cranky goat who serves as his social media
coordinator, this space will keep them working strong all throughout
the cold mountain weather.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445374838/p25cuzwtslcg6o8awqrv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>Not only will this space
be able to house a small herd, but it will also serve as their
personal pantry, housing a hayloft that will keep them in the grain
all winter!  This space will also help to free up room in the
basement so that visiting residents—I mean, VIPs—will have more
space for painting, woodworking, and more! 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Donate now in order to
help us raise the $5,000 we need to buy the lumber, roofing, siding,
paint, and trimmings for this fantastic new campaign space, and you
will receive any number of excellent perks—your own “Jayne for
President” buttons, bumper stickers, mousepads, plus lots of swag
from Jayne's good friends over at <a href=""www.sundresspublications.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sundress Publications</a>!<br/><br/>All donors will be invited to a spring barnraising shindig to celebrate the campaign's success!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All donations for this
campaign are tax-deductible and go to support Jayne's number-one
cause—the arts! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445374853/o9pyx1akubfd8fk0hnco.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>  <br/>
<p>
</p><p><b>Other Ways to Help</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't support Jayne
financially, be sure to tell your friends about this campaign on
social media and be sure to Like Jayne's supporters at the<a href=""http://www.sundressacademyforthearts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Sundress Academy for the Arts</a> over on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SundressAcademyForTheArts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook </a>and follow Jayne on Twitter

Hi, we're Sundress Publications, and we're in the process of building a new barn at Firefly Farms, our forty-five acre instructional, residency, and outreach center. Much of the equipment we have for our visiting artists and staff—including a drafting table, antique letterpress, and specialized tools—must share space with livestock feeds and farm equipment in our basement. This barn will allow us to reclaim the space and transform it from a general-purpose storage area to a workspace for visiting artists and writers.And now, a political advertisement from Jayne the Donkey:It's that time again,
where the best and brightest of our country come together to talk
about the important issues that affect all American citizens in order
to move our nation forward. Where the unbiased media discusses and
weighs the best ideas and informs us, the citizens, who we could
democratically elect for our next leader.

JUST KIDDING!

It's time for a bunch of
grown human beings—let's be honest, mostly straight white males—to
yell at one another on stage! It's time for gaffes, sound bites, and
the general denigration of social progress!

So, why not just skip to
the chase and vote for a REAL jackass this election season?

That's right. Jayne, the
Sundress Academy for the Arts donkey, is throwing his hilarious donkey-sized hat into the
ring to be the new leader of the free world.  Because he's an ass,
but an ass you can trust!


What We Need and What
You Get

In order to get Jayne's
political career started, we need to construct his campaign
headquarters, a 

16' x 32' barn that will
shelter him and his herd through the silly season and right into the
primaries! With plenty of covered seating for Jayne and his staff of
six sheep and a cranky goat who serves as his social media
coordinator, this space will keep them working strong all throughout
the cold mountain weather.

Not only will this space
be able to house a small herd, but it will also serve as their
personal pantry, housing a hayloft that will keep them in the grain
all winter!  This space will also help to free up room in the
basement so that visiting residents—I mean, VIPs—will have more
space for painting, woodworking, and more! 


Donate now in order to
help us raise the $5,000 we need to buy the lumber, roofing, siding,
paint, and trimmings for this fantastic new campaign space, and you
will receive any number of excellent perks—your own “Jayne for
President” buttons, bumper stickers, mousepads, plus lots of swag
from Jayne's good friends over at Sundress Publications!All donors will be invited to a spring barnraising shindig to celebrate the campaign's success!

All donations for this
campaign are tax-deductible and go to support Jayne's number-one
cause—the arts!   

Other Ways to Help

If you can't support Jayne
financially, be sure to tell your friends about this campaign on
social media and be sure to Like Jayne's supporters at the Sundress Academy for the Arts over on Facebook and follow Jayne on Twitter
@SundressPub. You can also find out more about how to volunteer at
Firefly Farms here!

support, your vote, and your belief in a transparent political system

The Book

I am honored to have been asked to publish a second book with Daylight Books distributed by D.A.P Distributed Art Publishers, release date, spring 2016. This campaign will help finance the creation of Collections: Birds Bones Butterflies, a hardback 128 page book of photographs with text by ornithologist John Fitzpatrick, Ph.D.and curator Xandra Eden. 



Birds from the North Carolina museum of Natural Sciences 


The What

Collections is a series of photographs of bird skins,
bleached bones, tattered shoes and fragile butterflies that I have unearthed from
the dark drawers of national park museum collections. Plucked from their
original context, I illuminate them with sun and light, giving them new
definition. The subject matter of each series I create is dictated by my discoveries, bridging past to present, honoring both the specimens I works
with and the medium of photography.


Bones from the Everglades National Park


The Why
Collections is
particularly timely during this centennial year of national parks service when
climate change, and funding allocations for museums threaten indigenous species and
artifacts into extinction. My focus on the parks is a way of preserving these
fragile specimens that represent American history. This body of work sheds
light on the importance and significance of the collections and their impact on
science, history, the humanities and the hundreds of thousands of visitors – current and future – who leave their
footprints on our national parks.

The Who


Fine art: My combined immersion in art and anthropology shaped my love of
stories and gave me the tools to artfully map and investigate history -- my own and others. I primarily work in 19th century photographic
processes intertwined with 21st century digital technology. In addition to my work being held in private and public collections across the country, I also exhibit nationally in galleries, museums and public spaces. 
Books and publications: I was one of the core photographers for Bull City Summer, along with Alec Soth, Hank Willis Thomas and Hiroshi Wantanabe, a collaborative documentary project that explores the Durham Bulls AAA baseball team. The book, published by Daylight Books, was released in 2014, and is one of their top sellers. My images have appeared in numerous publications including The New Yorker, the Paris Review Daily and Slate.com.
Community Art: Along with Lynn Bregman Blass, I am co-founder of the Visual History Collaborative.  We work with individuals, families, communities and organizations to create custom art through stories and artifacts– memories and mementos.
Educator: I received an MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute (where I also taught) and a BA in Anthropology and Sociology from Guilford College. I am a visiting assistant professor at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro,  North Carolina. I also teach at Duke University's Center for Documentary Studies and have also taught at the Maine Photographic Workshops.

</h3>
<i>How it all started...<br/></i> In 2007 I studied in India as part of a year-long, multi-country study abroad program called Rethinking Globalization. One afternoon I found myself sitting in a tent listening to a well-known local activist berate me and my classmates for our complicit role in what he called genocide - the thousands of farmer suicides committed every year, many of them by cotton farmers from the Vidarbha region. <a href=""http://chrgj.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Farmer-Suicides.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Every 30 minutes</a>, a farmer in India, overwhelmed with debt, commits suicide. I was a consumer and citizen of the United States, a country that heavily subsidizes cotton, making the competition for non-US farmers next to impossible. Over the next few days I visited farms and heard several farmers tout Bt cotton, a genetically modified seed introduced by the St. Louis-based multi-national corporation, Monsanto. But these farmers who praised Bt had not seen an increase in productivity or profit, as was promised by Monsanto’s advertising. The contradiction that lies at the kernel of this encounter was the question that led me to return to India: Why do farmers promote the modernization of agriculture when it does not always serve their interests?<br/><br/><p>In 2011 I received a Fulbright research and language grant to spend a year working with cotton farmers and studying cotton farming in Maharashtra, India. A myriad of social, economic, and environmental factors play into this epidemic. In an effort to shed more light on this tragedy and gain a better understanding of the situation, I spent 7 months in Mulgavan, a village in central India that is primarily comprised of small-scale cotton farmers living below the poverty line. My research culminated with two projects: a body of photographs and <a href=""https://amcmullin.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog posts</a> documenting cotton farmers' experiences, and a <a href=""https://amcmullin.wordpress.com/2014/04/14/invisible-hands-voices-from-the-global-economy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">narrative of a widow of a cotton farmer</a> which was included in the <a href=""http://voiceofwitness.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voice of Witness</a> book <a href=""http://voiceofwitness.org/labor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Invisible Hands: Voices from the Global Economy</a>. Through both of these projects I strive to take viewers beyond the statistics and consider the complexity of the lives of cotton farmers and their families.  I portray universal characteristics of humanity, hoping to, by doing so, narrow the gap between consumers of cotton and cotton farmers. Due to the time constraints my Fulbright and research visa, I had to leave India prior to the end of the cotton season and was unable to document the  final stages of the cotton season, including the harvest. My research felt incomplete, and although I had found two wonderful and creative outlets to share the work with audiences back in the US, I wanted to do more. <i><i><br/><br/>Since returning to St. Louis... <br/></i></i>I have timidly dreamt of creating some large-scale installation art piece that would play with the overwhelming number of farmer suicides in a way that had a more lasting and meaningful impact than hearing ""Over 250,000 farmers have suicided…"" My journals from the last few years are littered with questions like, How can I use cotton products like q-tips, tampons, t-shirts, bed sheets, gauze, etc. to represent the overwhelming number of Indian farmers that have taken their lives due to the pressures of debt that they've undertaken in order to grow cotton?

My work in the art community in St. Louis has opened up my process to be one that is more collaborative. This has inspired me to think of ways that I can work with cotton farmers that I met in India on this body of work, tentatively titled ""100% cotton."" The exact details of the forms that ""100% cotton"" can take are in progress. How the work unfolds is largely up to the farmers that I will be working with when I go back to India in October.

I'll be working on creating some art pieces with cotton farmers about their lives and their experiences as farmers. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<i><i>Funding for... <br/></i></i>I received a grant from the <a href=""http://racstl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regional Arts Commission</a> in St. Louis to help fund this project. I also recently won <a href=""http://www.stlsloup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sloup</a>, a monthly soup dinner that crowdfunds arts and community impacts projects in St. Louis, MO. I'm quitting my job and committing all of my time to this project. While the funding from RAC and Sloup is enough to cover the basic bare-necessities of my project, I need additional funds to <br/><ul>
<li>cover costs of materials</li>
<li>extend the period during which I will have a translator helping me (my Marathi is a bit rusty!)</li>
<li>give myself a cushion for in-country expenses while in India</li>
<li>have time to work on finishing the project and installing in gallery(ies) when I return. </li>
</ul>
<p>The $5,500 that I am aiming to raise with this Indiegogo campaign includes my funding needs as well as the cost of the Indiegogo fee, costs of printing/shipping for rewards, etc. Regardless of whether I reach my goal of raising $5,500, I will be going to India! The additional funding will help broaden the scope and possibility of the project and enable me to dedicate all of my time and energy to this project rather than, say, waiting tables!<br/></p>
<p><i><i>Why does this even matter?<br/></i></i>We all use cotton every day, whether it's in the t-shirt we're wearing, the kitchen towel we dry our dishes with, the cotton ball we take our makeup off with, the dollar bill we spend at the gas station… St. Louis is the home of Monsanto, which, like it or not, plays a role in this story. I feel that we all have a responsibility to know the far reaching impact of this multi-national corporation that prides itself in having such a positive impact on our city through its grant programs that support the arts and sciences. <br/></p>
<p>This project is a meaningful opportunity for me to take a leap in my journey as an artist and build on past projects like a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP069VLhSLQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance art piece</a> I created in 2009 and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtr9lWK9pM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">children's book</a> I wrote and illustrated in 2010. It will allow me to continue my research on cotton farming and find more creative ways to bring the issues to audiences that might be, like I was in 2007, ignorantly complicit. At every step in this process I hope that my passion for this issue and my desire to use art to envision alternatives to the dire situation that cotton farmers are in shines through and that people like you are already learning something. With your help, I can have a wider impact and reach more people in more powerful ways! </p>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Times are hard... Money is tight... I get it! But there are several ways you can help out without getting your wallet out:</p> <ul> <li>Share my project with your friends and family - maybe one of them can make a donation and the more people learning about this, the better! <br/>

Alberto Aguilar, Edra Soto and Christa Donner at the first Antiquarian Luncheon.<br/><br/><h3><i>SHoP (Southside Hub of Production) was founded in 2010 by Laura 
Shaeffer, Mike Phillips and John Preus.  SHoP’s main aim is to stimulate
 local cultural activity and to foster 
artistic and cultural enrichment in the neighborhood, with the aim of 
reclaiming the commons and the networks of interdependency that create a
 fulfilling economy. </i></h3><br/><h3><i>SHoP serves as a platform for artists young and old, writers, film-makers, 
craftspeople and educators and local civic organizations to gather and 
exchange resources and expertise, curate exhibits, host events and 
workshops, and provide space for local groups to meet. </i></h3><p><br/></p><h2>
<i><b>SHoP Now:</b></i><br/>
</h2><h4><i>In
 the spring of 2015, Top Studios, our former benefactor, invited 
SHoP to run the  project space in a 
beautiful storefront in Hyde Park, formerly occupied by the inspiring 
and beloved O'Gara and Wilson Antiquarian Bookstore. <br/></i></h4><p>Our vision for the current space is to set up a shared studio and production hall in the back, with makers units and tables for bookbinding, sewing and design, and self -publishing as well as other creative workshops and after-school arts activities. The studio would be well organized and flexible enough to accommodate events, film screenings and weekly salon nights as well to provide space for writer's groups, and other communities of practice. <br/></p><p>The front display area would be used to showcase the objects made in the back production hall as well as provide space for self-published works from all over Chicago and beyond, feature editions and objects of interest and usefulness from local designers and, as well as objects of curiosity in keeping with the curatorial tradition of the former bookstore.</p><p>We plan to curate a series of large-scale exhibits that are participatory in nature, lasting 3 months each that would provide an atmosphere of reflection and community interest. <br/></p><h4>
<i>Since May of 2015, we have offered art 
classes to all ages; held film
 screenings, ran two </i><i>intensive </i><i>summer camps and hosted literary events 
and 
public forums on a variety of topics. Our first exhibit, curated by Jorge Lucero was <a href=""http://www.jorgelucero.com/Pages/BARACKOBAMAPRESIDENTIALLIBRARY.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Barack Obama Presidential Library</a> it opened June 5 <a href=""http://www.jorgelucero.com/Pages/BOPLPRESS.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>and was featured in DNAInfo, the Sun-Times,  WTTW's Chicago Tonight <a href=""http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2015/06/11/other-obama-library"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">

 would like to continue to curate exhibits and offer shared studio 
space for workshops, performances and events that foster a sense of art and human possibility outside of existing commercial and 
institutional venues. But in order to achieve this we 
need your help. </i></h3><p><b>We have been generously given a window of 
reduced 
rent allowing us to establish a proof of concept.  Due to Top Studios’ 
sudden financial withdrawal, we need 
to raise a minimum of $6,000 to cover 
operational costs and rent through the end of the calendar year, and 
$15,000 is our ultimate goal to stay beyond that time and invest in 
shared resources such as a large film screen, sound system, mic, tables, 
and rolling cabinets for our workshops and classes. We will continue to 
research grants

Alberto Aguilar, Edra Soto and Christa Donner at the first Antiquarian Luncheon.<br/><br/><br/><h4><b>A brief history of The Op Shop and SHoP</b></h4><p>The Op Shop, the precursor project to SHoP, was initiated by Laura Shaeffer in 2009. Inspired by a long tradition of magical curiosity shops that have appeared for centuries in fiction and in real life, she imagined using some of the many vacant storefronts in Hyde Park on a temporary basis to create sites of independent cultural exchange. The Op Shop occupied four different storefront locations on 55th street between Lake Park and Cornell, at 53rd and Lake Park in Harper Court and finally at 53rd and Ellis,  before morphing into its next, more ambitious project: SHoP: the Southside Hub of Production. The Op Shop asked these questions: What do we have, what do we lack, and how do we use what we have to create the world we need?. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440281728/hpllp7zgmfd0pzx65g47.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Op Shop 1, 2009.

</div></div>","Alberto Aguilar, Edra Soto and Christa Donner at the first Antiquarian Luncheon.SHoP (Southside Hub of Production) was founded in 2010 by Laura 
Shaeffer, Mike Phillips and John Preus.  SHoP’s main aim is to stimulate
 local cultural activity and to foster 
artistic and cultural enrichment in the neighborhood, with the aim of 
reclaiming the commons and the networks of interdependency that create a
 fulfilling economy. SHoP serves as a platform for artists young and old, writers, film-makers, 
craftspeople and educators and local civic organizations to gather and 
exchange resources and expertise, curate exhibits, host events and 
workshops, and provide space for local groups to meet. 
SHoP Now:
In
 the spring of 2015, Top Studios, our former benefactor, invited 
SHoP to run the  project space in a 
beautiful storefront in Hyde Park, formerly occupied by the inspiring 
and beloved O'Gara and Wilson Antiquarian Bookstore. Our vision for the current space is to set up a shared studio and production hall in the back, with makers units and tables for bookbinding, sewing and design, and self -publishing as well as other creative workshops and after-school arts activities. The studio would be well organized and flexible enough to accommodate events, film screenings and weekly salon nights as well to provide space for writer's groups, and other communities of practice. The front display area would be used to showcase the objects made in the back production hall as well as provide space for self-published works from all over Chicago and beyond, feature editions and objects of interest and usefulness from local designers and, as well as objects of curiosity in keeping with the curatorial tradition of the former bookstore.We plan to curate a series of large-scale exhibits that are participatory in nature, lasting 3 months each that would provide an atmosphere of reflection and community interest. 
Since May of 2015, we have offered art 
classes to all ages; held film
 screenings, ran two intensive summer camps and hosted literary events 
and 
public forums on a variety of topics. Our first exhibit, curated by Jorge Lucero was The Barack Obama Presidential Library it opened June 5  and was featured in DNAInfo, the Sun-Times,  WTTW's Chicago Tonight 
local ABC news, and WBEZ, among other media. BOPL Press

Opening night of The Barack Obama Presidential Library, June 5, 2015.Top Studios had committed to a three-year lease beginning this past May, but abruptly withdrew its funding in July.We
 would like to continue to curate exhibits and offer shared studio 
space for workshops, performances and events that foster a sense of art and human possibility outside of existing commercial and 
institutional venues. But in order to achieve this we 
need your help. We have been generously given a window of 
reduced 
rent allowing us to establish a proof of concept.  Due to Top Studios’ 
sudden financial withdrawal, we need 
to raise a minimum of $6,000 to cover 
operational costs and rent through the end of the calendar year, and 
$15,000 is our ultimate goal to stay beyond that time and invest in 
shared resources such as a large film screen, sound system, mic, tables, 
and rolling cabinets for our workshops and classes. We will continue to 
research grants 
and other forms of funding to help us become sustainable. Your donations
 are tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, the Resource Center, http://www.resourcecenterchicago.org/

Thank you for your time and continued support. All contributions are appreciated and we look forward to seeing you soon!Thank you to all who have participated in SHoP projects, past, present, and future.

For two years, 
with support from the First Unitarian Church of Hyde Park and supporter 
and philanthropist Dr. Ken Schug, we were housed in a 16-room mansion 
in Hyde Park called the Fenn House.

After
 leaving the mansion at the end of our scheduled tenure there, we 
continued to program events and classes, and curate exhibits in other 
venues, one example is Ben Hecht's House Party, curated by Laura Shaeffer and Paul Durica: Ben Hecht's House Party.

Alberto Aguilar, Edra Soto and Christa Donner at the first Antiquarian Luncheon.A brief history of The Op Shop and SHoPThe Op Shop, the precursor project to SHoP, was initiated by Laura Shaeffer in 2009. Inspired by a long tradition of magical curiosity shops that have appeared for centuries in fiction and in real life, she imagined using some of the many vacant storefronts in Hyde Park on a temporary basis to create sites of independent cultural exchange. The Op Shop occupied four different storefront locations on 55th street between Lake Park and Cornell, at 53rd and Lake Park in Harper Court and finally at 53rd and Ellis,  before morphing into its next, more ambitious project: SHoP: the Southside Hub of Production. The Op Shop asked these questions: What do we have, what do we lack, and how do we use what we have to create the world we need?. Op Shop 1, 2009. Window painting by Anders Nilsen: Swamp Trees.

Co-founder and co-creator of the Bronx Latin American Art Biennial, Founding member of BxArts Factory. I've curated exhibitions and art projects at the Bronx Museum of Art, NY; Museum of Piraguasu Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil; Museum of Satu Mare, Romania; The Point, Bronx, NY; Bronx Art Space, Bronx, NY; Boricua College Art Gallery, New York, NY; Union College, Schenectady, NY; Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, NY; and at The Mexican Cultural Institute, NY. I am also the author of books such as: “Latin America, The Culture and the New Men”; “Objective Reference of Painting: The work of Ismael Checo, 1986-2006”; Reflections: The Sensationalism of the Art from Cuba. All three published by Wasteland Press; and Rigo Peralta: Revelaciones de un Universo Mistico, published by Argos Publications, Dominican Republic.
Our goal with this campaign is to raise fundings to continue bringing to our community high quality exhibitions and art projects. We started this great art project in 2008 and every two years we present 5 to 8 art exhibitions as well as urban installations and art performances by artists from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela.
Your contribution is very important to us, your support will help us to provide education and cultural information for everyone. All the events and art exhibitions are family oriented. It’s an event that celebrates not only the richness of the Latin American Art but also the diversity of our community. This event offers the community the opportunity to access people from diverse cultural backgrounds, languages and ethnicity.

<p><strong>IN FLIEDEN </strong></p>
<p>When she visited the former Synagogue in Flieden in 2013, Marie Ariel of Cambridge, MA met the pastor of the Church, Holger Biehn. She told Pastor Biehn that her father had his bar mitzvah in the Synagogue in 1899. Pastor Biehn told Marie  that he and members of the Church are committed to keeping in memory Nazism’s horrific ending of Jewish life in Flieden. But they are equally determined to honor the 500 years of Flieden's Jewish community and the years of Jewish worship in the Synagogue.  They want that history to be illuminated in the building.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470364488/ao9dd4w9f7zd3ibzhsba.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Pastor Biehn told Marie he wanted help finding a Jewish artist to create stained glass windows for the Church. Marie told Pastor Biehn about <strong><a href=""http://www.bzeitz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barney Zeitz </a></strong>of Martha’s Vineyard, an artist who had for many decades created exceptional stained glass for churches and synagogues and had also created striking sculptures like The Holocaust Memorial at R.I.

<p>The Evangelische Kirche is one of 4 or 5 churches now housed in former synagogues in Germany. It will be the first church to do more than mount a plaque to commemorate the Jewish history of the building and of the Jewish congregants.</p>
<p>The Church did a fundraising campaign for their building restoration which included a portion for the stained glass windows. Flieden is a small town. The residents are not wealthy by any means but the State Church agreed to double the money they raised, so they are able to pay for the first three windows.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Ronnie Kroell</strong>, <i>actor</i> | <i>producer </i>| <i>model</i> | <i>activist</i>. You might remember me from <i>BRAVO's</i>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1159605/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>""Make Me a Supermodel""</strong></a> in 2008, where I was the <i>runner-up</i> and had my television ""Bromance"" with Ben DiChiara. Some of you may have picked up my 2010 issue of <a href=""http://www.playgirl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>PLAYGIRL Magazine</strong></a>, watched me in films like <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833845"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>EATING OUT DRAMA CAMP</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1986871"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>INTO THE LION'S DEN</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262073"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SCROOGE &amp; MARLEY</strong></a>, or perhaps you have generously supported my efforts to prevent and heal the effects of bullying by celebrating friendship with <a href=""http://www.friendmovement.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>FRIEND MOVEMENT</strong></a>. </p>

The highs have been high, the lows have been low, and the in-betweens have been so over the top that I couldn't make them up if I tried! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Ronnie Kroell, actor | producer | model | activist. You might remember me from BRAVO's, ""Make Me a Supermodel"" in 2008, where I was the runner-up and had my television ""Bromance"" with Ben DiChiara. Some of you may have picked up my 2010 issue of PLAYGIRL Magazine, watched me in films like EATING OUT DRAMA CAMP, INTO THE LION'S DEN, SCROOGE & MARLEY, or perhaps you have generously supported my efforts to prevent and heal the effects of bullying by celebrating friendship with FRIEND MOVEMENT. 
This campaign is important to me because I have SO much to share with you about what has transpired in my life to date. Seriously, I feel like I've lived 100 years in only 33. The highs have been high, the lows have been low, and the in-betweens have been so over the top that I couldn't make them up if I tried!

You can see more about that specific project <a href=""https://haileyguzik.ca/Beach-Feast-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. ""Beach Feast"" aims to explore the dissonance between a truthful ""retelling” of my own memories and the fictionalized experience that is the installation itself.

<h2>So back to the campaign:</h2>
<h3>Let me break things down as simply as possible...</h3>
<p>By ordering a perk, your money will fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>merch costs including apparel, printing and packaging;</li>
<li>materials to produce new artwork for my exhibition (including paint, canvas, hardware materials, etc);</li>
<li>and travel-related costs (shipping or air-travel) to Saint John for the installation and opening of the exhibition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>I'm offering many perks from clothing and stickers, to original artworks! Choose from individual items and add-ons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Die-cut Sticker Sheets (4 x 6 inches)</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://haileyguzik.ca/Loud-Places"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loud Places</a> Landscape Stickers (3 x 4 inches)</li>
<li>Kwikway T-Shirt</li>
<li>Lupine Long-sleeve Shirt</li>
<li>Tantramar Tote Bag</li>
<li>Framed landscape studies</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Note on Orders &amp; Shipping</h3>
<p>Orders will be placed with the printer based on quantities ordered through this campaign. There will be limited merch available AFTER the campaign deadline, so be sure to place your order asap!</p>
<p>There are two PICK-UP options:  MONTREAL or SAINT JOHN</p>
<p>For those of you in Saint John, your orders will be available at <a href=""http://shopvisitors.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shop Visitors</a> for the opening of the exhibition, so you will be able to pick them up then! Montreal pals, I will be in touch to arrange pick-up times after the campaign has ended.</p>
<p>If you reside in other areas of Canada, shipping to your location can be arranged by following the shipping prompts at check-out. I will be in touch after the campaign ends to confirm shipping information and additional shipping fees if necessary. </p>
<h3>My Personal Contribution</h3>
<p>I know it's a lot to ask for your help in making this happen, but I hope providing you with exciting new merch will make it all worth it! In addition to your contribution, all sales on artwork outside of this campaign in the next two months will go directly to this project. If we don't reach the entire goal, your money will still count! Orders for merch will still be placed, but it is unlikely that I will be able to travel to Saint John to install my work. The money would instead be directed to shipping the work to <a href=""http://shopvisitors.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shop Visitors</a> and studio costs in Montreal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My first indiegogo campaign back in 2018 was a huge success. As a young artist, I believe in the importance of accessibility, so my decision to make printed apparel is a tangible next step. It is equally as important to connect with my peers, as it is to connect with experienced collectors. This process has been an amazing way to get to know you all, and has given me the confidence to move forward in new directions that I never thought possible!</p>
<p>With your help, this project will afford me the opportunity to grow my practice in new ways, which I hope to share with you every step of the way!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing this merch is equally as important to me as my upcoming exhibition. Time management and organization are tasks that I am constantly working to improve. Every time I take on a new project I learn things about myself, my expectations, your expectations, and my ability to deliver the ideas I propose. Each new project brings its own set of challenges and obstacles, but ultimately I am committed to learning, listening, and doing my best to make it all happen. Over the next few months, I will work diligently to make sure everything gets done. If there is a hiccup in the plan, I'll be sure to keep you updated. All I ask is for your patience since it's a one woman show! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometime you just can't contribute, and I completely understand. Instead, please consider sharing my campaign with your friends and family - or anyone you think might be interested in my project!</p>
<p>Spread the word through social media or word of mouth, I am grateful for it all!</p>

I am humbled to be a part of this creative group of people who has made time to collaborate together under my name.I have been playing drums since I was a toddler, under the influences of my father (also a musician) and his stellar jazz record collection. I have devoted much my life to the understanding and practice of music. Countless music teachers and experiences have brought me to where I am today.This campaign ""African Skies"" is important to me because, for the first time in my life I feel I have reached a level I believe people want to listen to and could recognize as my sound. With so many examples of great jazz music before us, it is easy to get lost copying other peoples sound. Your contribution will enable us, the Jemal Ramirez Group to continue reaching people with our recorded music and also in live concerts and shows. The unfortunate truth is, Jazz music is not profitable under the old music making model.

The memorial will form the finale to Transport for London and London Transport Museum’s 18-month programme Transported by Design, establishing Pick’s reputation as a pioneering visionary and highlighting the transformative effect excellent design has had on our Capital. WHAT WE WILL ACHIEVEBAFTA-winning and Turner Prize nominated artists Langlands & Bell have been commissioned to produce the Frank Pick memorial, a public sculptural installation.Located in Piccadilly Circus station, iconic for its circular design and its location at the centre of London, it will bring together the most enduring and immediately recognisable components of the London Transport design identity commissioned by Pick – Edward Johnston’s typeface, Charles Holden designed stations and crucially the roundel – the circular logo of the London Underground that is recognised the world over.The installation will incorporate Frank Pick’s name in neon light, on the familiar and much loved roundel, and Pick’s own words will be presented adjacent in polished cast bronze letters using the Johnston font. Our memorial will be unveiled on the 7 November 2016 to mark the 75th anniversary of Pick’s death and the centenary of the Johnston typeface. ABOUT LONDON TRANSPORT MUSEUMLondon Transport Museum is the world’s leading museum of urban transport. We use the story of transport to encourage, enrich and inspire all Londoners and those who love this city to get the most out of London.In summer 2015 Transport for London and London Transport Museum launched an 18-month programme of events and exhibitions highlighting how transport has shaped London and, through good design, made life in the Capital better. The Frank Pick memorial located in Piccadilly Circus Underground station will conclude the programme, illustrating the innovative ways good design has transformed the transport network and helped London to grow into a world class city.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>An escape room is a physical adventure game in which players solve a series of puzzles using clues, hints and strategy to complete objectives revealed in the course of action. Players are given a set time limit to unveil the secret plot which is hidden within the rooms.  There are secret codes, hidden messages, riddles, mazes, gears, levers, and pulleys. The rooms are often set in imaginary locales like a prison, a hotel, a dungeon etc.</p>

<p>We have asked our friend, a great artist, Cindy Panella, if she would be interested in helping us make some art public by adding a mural to the side of our building.  We thought of Cindy first because of her attitude toward art and because her work has heart.</p>

<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will help us to realize our dream of bringing a large-scale public art project to a small community in the Adirondacks.  Not only will it make a statement about art being everywhere, and in unexpected places, but it will bring joy to the thousands who see it.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $4800 to cover the cost of painting supplies and equipment. And to pay Cindy for her time and talent.  This will also help to offset the cost of printing the poster we are using as an incentive.</p>
<p>We are offering two main levels of support.  At the $25 level we are offering a beautiful poster depicting one of Cindy's paintings, ""Berries of Blue"".</p>

</div></div>","Who we are...what we want to do....
We are the Weal Family: Dave, Linda and Paula Weal.

We own Gallery 3040, and art gallery and gift shop in Old Forge, NY.

We love art.  We think art is for everyone, and we want everyone to have access to great art.  
There is a wall on the outside of the gallery...right now a pretty boring wall...we think this wall is a great opportunity to bring some art to the community of Old Forge.

We have asked our friend, a great artist, Cindy Panella, if she would be interested in helping us make some art public by adding a mural to the side of our building.  We thought of Cindy first because of her attitude toward art and because her work has heart.

Cindy is primarily known for her work in ceramics, but what sets here apart in all media is her imagination.

By contributing to our campaign, you will help us to realize our dream of bringing a large-scale public art project to a small community in the Adirondacks.  Not only will it make a statement about art being everywhere, and in unexpected places, but it will bring joy to the thousands who see it.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $4800 to cover the cost of painting supplies and equipment. And to pay Cindy for her time and talent.  This will also help to offset the cost of printing the poster we are using as an incentive.
We are offering two main levels of support.  At the $25 level we are offering a beautiful poster depicting one of Cindy's paintings, ""Berries of Blue"".

At the $100 level we are offering 4 copies of the poster (one for you and three to share with your friends) as well as your name painted on an inside wall of Gallery 3040 thanking you for supporting our project.

The painting supplies alone cost $1800.  All additional proceeds will go toward paying the artist.  
Should we raise more money than needed additional funds will go to support additional public art projects in this community.

 

Art Inspires...
Art enhances our lives and it beautifies our communities.  It inspires people to think and to try and to grow and to wonder.  We think this mural will demonstrate to visitors and residents alike that this is a community that appreciates the arts and all the benefits art brings.

<h2>Who Are We and What Do We Want?</h2>
<p>We are a group of highly skilled individuals, also known as ""SuperStars""! We are merging together this year to create a unified vision of excellence and community building. With the joint forces of 2016 projects such as The Octopussy art car, Radically Adequate sound and theme camp (Apo), Camp Lackadaisical (Apo) and the Colorado Guild of Mile Higher Knowledge (BM), we are honored to now bring you; Event Horizon Colorado! </p>
<h3>Some of the people on our team, and what they plan to contribute to our village, Event Horizon:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Guthrey and Kitty - </strong><b>Octopussy Mutant Vehicle</b></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491162961/rhy5yiekjnbxjpgtwnf4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>The Octopussy is a mutant vehicle that explores the depths of space and time.  As an octopus/cat hybrid creature, she has ears and nose like a cat, eyes and tentacles like an octopus; all perched atop a Geo.  The Octopussy is able to change color on the fly thanks to being radically illuminated with 6000 sound reactive LEDs.  The Geo is decorated to appear as a rock in the interstellar ocean and the interior is a plush underwater lounge where Apogaeans can rest their weary fins.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">At Apogaea 2016, basking in the glow of the Octopussy during her inaugural festival celebration, Guthrey proposed to Kitty. This night we were overwhelmed with joy to see how much Apogaeans loved the Octopussy. This project was just a dream before we started dating and through the literal blood, sweat, and tears, we found that there is nothing that could ever separate us or stifle our drive to bring the Octopussy to life. Sharing this art piece with people brings us so much satisfaction, we want to continue to bring this interactive art piece to the Apogaea community.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In order to realize the dreams of sharing this art, we a small amount of funding.  This will go towards upgrading the visual appearance of this project in multiple ways, including the addition of fiber optic whiskers, as well as improving the interactivity of this art piece.  For Apogaea 2017, we plan on hosting stationary/imaginary driving tests and issuing Octopussy driver's licenses.  We also plan on crafting little tentacle babies to give away to lucky Apogaeans!  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Learn more about the Octopussy at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tentaclesforall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/tentaclesforall</a> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In addition to building the Octopussy, Kitty has worked with 3 different production companies over the past 7 years.  Through this she has hosted an uncountable number of shows and helped fundraise for many different causes.  In addition, she has created 3 different community groups including: Cooking for a Cause (which brings healthy, nutritious food to people in recovery), Crunk Cookbook Club, and the Denver Art Car Collective.  Kitty has a passion for organizing and orchestrating and brings all of that energy and focus to her work with the Octopussy and Event Horizon!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jay Wood (Dubwood) – Warp Drive Beacon</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Last year, confusion plagued the wandering spirits of Apogaea. Where are the event boundaries? Where are camps located? How do I get back to center camp? What did I step in? Our camp is located in a remote area. The problem was that you had travel down a dark road that looked like it was off limits, or led to a seedy van marked “free candy”.  We want to solve this problem by erecting a bright ass beacon that can be seen from nearly every vantage point, especially from center camp.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The beacon will be a free-standing structure with an arrangement of the LED’s at the top in the fashion of a Supercluster. This representation of multiple galaxies within galaxies, is in sync with our camp theme, and the purpose of having a navigational tool up in the sky for the community to utilize.  This project serves one purpose; to establish a point of reference. Apogaea is located on such a vast piece property, and much like the burn, people get lost.  Kick ass. Help us get this warp drive beacon off the ground (pun intended), and contribute to our Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Jay Wood (Dubwood) – Sound Engineer and Fabricator of OVRSOUND</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491449523/y6qqazqzixzvrfltw6kg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Several years ago, OVRSOUND was created. OVRSOUND’s goal was to create a medium sized, high powered, 5 way sound system that excelled in a festival type environment. The man behind this lofty project is Jay Wood (Dubwood).  With other sound companies like Funktion 1, and Void, the demand for high performing touring and club audio rigs has raised the bar for audio quality. Not only prime sound companies like these have raised the bar, but the music produced today covers such a wide spectrum of frequencies that a finely tuned sound rig is essential.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Run of the mill sound rigs you buy from a retail outlet don’t cut it anymore. Sure you can buy something that is adequate, but who want’s that. You really need a rig that can be tuned on the fly, cover the most desired frequencies, designed to perform a certain way at a certain power level, and each cabinet has a particular function, and digitally processed to achieve crystal clear sound within those desired frequencies, all the while consuming minimal power.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Enter OVRSOUND.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Jay Wood (Dubwood) strives to not only build a highly functional, crystal clear, transportable sound rig, but also construct a work of art. With a striking red and black design, and a very custom look, this amazing rig not only gets rave reviews on the sound quality, but also gets compliments on the visual impact.  Using the best construction techniques, latest enclosure designs, latest technology, and the correct drivers paired with proper enclosure, OVRSOUND is accomplishing a tremendous amount of sound with relatively little power. This is engineering a system that is highly efficient. This is ideal.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As OVRSOUND strives to accomplish pure audio perfection, the second version of the rig is under development (OVRSOUND 2.0). Striving to achieve even greater efficiency, adding more cabinets, and the introduction of LIVE audio tuning through Digital Sound Processing, OVRSOUND needs donations to evolve and keep blowing minds at our events.  OVRSOUND is reserved for Event Horizon events. OVRSOUND is not a PA rental company. The rig is not for hire, sale, or structured as a “for profit” business. We bust out this bad boy for you to enjoy at our events and at Apogaea. A custom, high fidelity sound rig that keeps people coming back time and time again to experience.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Help us get achieve audio perfection. Donate today!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><b>Mary Hall aka Malia</b></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mary has been building theme camps since her first year on the playa! After buying her Burning Man tickets on a whim back in 2011, she jumped in full force and organized a 32 person theme camp in 7 weeks. Since then she has built more than a handful of theme camps at both Apogaea and Burning Man, as well as participating at a high level in several community projects &amp; events over the last years including being on the board of directors for Colorado's regionally sanctioned decompression in 2012. In 2016 Mary attended the Burning Man Global Leadership  Conference which helped further her knowledge and skills within the Burning Man community. Mary owns a production company and has been building her reputation as a top notch event producer in Denver. Her strengths are in people management, organization, finance and overall event production. Malia is her ""artist/DJ""  alias. Please check out some of her work on Soundcloud! <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/maliawhomp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/maliawhomp</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><b>Brandon DeRosa - Phoenix Cluster Shade Structure</b></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Brandon is excited to be apart of this project because he feels it's a huge stepping stone for making our little village stand out and become more comfortable. He also feel that the ""Phoenix Cluster"" is a perfect place to house future entertainment projects and also become a key gathering spot for the village.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Our Hopeful Budget</strong><br/>Our overall village budget is $8,750, while our IndieGoGo goal is only $2500. We've raised, and plan to raise the rest of our budget with local events and further fund raising!! While each of our main projects did apply for Apogaea art grants, none of them received funding during the first round. We are hopeful that some funding will be granted during round two, however the maximum that we may receive is &lt;$599 per project. Due to our lack of funding we had to reduce our original budget of $16,000 to ensure we could cover the most pertinent items while still offering an all encompassing community experience! Our village will include a custom built stage, large sound rig, quality lighting scheme, shaded dance floor and chill area, interactive art projects &amp; the Octopussy art car! We will offer community gatherings &amp; workshops along with will hosting daily/nightly events that highlight the wide scope of talented performers in our group! The vision is to create a place in spacetime that once you pass through, you will not be able (or want) to escape! </p>

<h3>The Impact!</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are a collective of artists, musicians, performers, builders, organizers, event producers, healers, and teachers. We create spaces for people to thrive! We offer a welcoming home base for people new to the artist/burner community, while helping them channel their passions and expand their knowledge! We have a team of seasoned burners who wish for nothing more than to share our experience &amp; know-how to achieve one grand vision of unity and radical collaboration. We value the 10 principals and upholding the Burning Man culture. Anyone involved in our project will be encouraged to push beyond their comfort zones and explore what they are truly capable of. With the help from professionals in various trades, we offer a stage for others to reach their highest potential!</li>
<li>Our group of lovers, thinkers, builders, creators, and do-ers have also participated in many successful community projects including camps Radically Adequate (Apo 2016), the Octopussy (Apo 2016), Attachment Unavailable (non-Apo 2015), Geological Point of Interest (GPOI) (Apo 2014), Panopolis (Apo 2013), Atom and Eden (Apo 2012), the Dubmarine (Apo 2012), as well as the Temple Build at Apo 2014 in honor of Jenny Kush. </li>
<li>We seek to partner with our wide spread artist community and create a culture of radical inclusion, participation &amp; radical support by offering our time, talents and knowledge both monetarily and energetically to other camps and projects! We believe in abundance and that when we work together, we can further extend our reach to other like-minded artists and visionaries!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Being our first year as a collective and having a name unknown to the community at large, we are working diligently as a group to get the word out about our vision. Our first fundraiser was a HUGE success due to the hard work of everyone on our team! However, we have many challenges to face due to the lack of funding received from Apogaea and the short amount of turn around time we have to first get funded and then physically build our projects. We have a large vision but not a lot of wo/man power to make it come alive! </li>
<li>Through individual conversations within our friends, family and community members, we hope to inspire others to join our grand vision. You know what they say, ""It takes a village"" :-)</li>
<li>We will be having 1-2 additional fundraisers to help raise money &amp; spread awareness. We also value participating in other camps and projects so that we can show our support on behalf of the bigger picture, the Apogaea Regional Burn. With our community outreach and dedicated crew, we hope to share common ground and find ways to work towards a united vision. </li>
</ul>

In order to realize the dreams of sharing this art, we a small amount of funding.  This will go towards upgrading the visual appearance of this project in multiple ways, including the addition of fiber optic whiskers, as well as improving the interactivity of this art piece.  For Apogaea 2017, we plan on hosting stationary/imaginary driving tests and issuing Octopussy driver's licenses.  We also plan on crafting little tentacle babies to give away to lucky Apogaeans!

In addition to building the Octopussy, Kitty has worked with 3 different production companies over the past 7 years.  Through this she has hosted an uncountable number of shows and helped fundraise for many different causes.  In addition, she has created 3 different community groups including: Cooking for a Cause (which brings healthy, nutritious food to people in recovery), Crunk Cookbook Club, and the Denver Art Car Collective.  Kitty has a passion for organizing and orchestrating and brings all of that energy and focus to her work with the Octopussy and Event Horizon!
Jay Wood (Dubwood) – Warp Drive Beacon
Last year, confusion plagued the wandering spirits of Apogaea. Where are the event boundaries? Where are camps located? How do I get back to center camp? What did I step in? Our camp is located in a remote area. The problem was that you had travel down a dark road that looked like it was off limits, or led to a seedy van marked “free candy”.  We want to solve this problem by erecting a bright ass beacon that can be seen from nearly every vantage point, especially from center camp.  
The beacon will be a free-standing structure with an arrangement of the LED’s at the top in the fashion of a Supercluster. This representation of multiple galaxies within galaxies, is in sync with our camp theme, and the purpose of having a navigational tool up in the sky for the community to utilize.  This project serves one purpose; to establish a point of reference. Apogaea is located on such a vast piece property, and much like the burn, people get lost.  Kick ass. Help us get this warp drive beacon off the ground (pun intended), and contribute to our Indiegogo campaign.
Jay Wood (Dubwood) – Sound Engineer and Fabricator of OVRSOUND

Several years ago, OVRSOUND was created. OVRSOUND’s goal was to create a medium sized, high powered, 5 way sound system that excelled in a festival type environment. The man behind this lofty project is Jay Wood (Dubwood).  With other sound companies like Funktion 1, and Void, the demand for high performing touring and club audio rigs has raised the bar for audio quality. Not only prime sound companies like these have raised the bar, but the music produced today covers such a wide spectrum of frequencies that a finely tuned sound rig is essential.
Run of the mill sound rigs you buy from a retail outlet don’t cut it anymore. Sure you can buy something that is adequate, but who want’s that. You really need a rig that can be tuned on the fly, cover the most desired frequencies, designed to perform a certain way at a certain power level, and each cabinet has a particular function, and digitally processed to achieve crystal clear sound within those desired frequencies, all the while consuming minimal power.
Enter OVRSOUND.
Jay Wood (Dubwood) strives to not only build a highly functional, crystal clear, transportable sound rig, but also construct a work of art. With a striking red and black design, and a very custom look, this amazing rig not only gets rave reviews on the sound quality, but also gets compliments on the visual impact.  Using the best construction techniques, latest enclosure designs, latest technology, and the correct drivers paired with proper enclosure, OVRSOUND is accomplishing a tremendous amount of sound with relatively little power. This is engineering a system that is highly efficient. This is ideal.
As OVRSOUND strives to accomplish pure audio perfection, the second version of the rig is under development (OVRSOUND 2.0). Striving to achieve even greater efficiency, adding more cabinets, and the introduction of LIVE audio tuning through Digital Sound Processing, OVRSOUND needs donations to evolve and keep blowing minds at our events.  OVRSOUND is reserved for Event Horizon events. OVRSOUND is not a PA rental company. The rig is not for hire, sale, or structured as a “for profit” business. We bust out this bad boy for you to enjoy at our events and at Apogaea. A custom, high fidelity sound rig that keeps people coming back time and time again to experience.
Help us get achieve audio perfection. Donate today!

Brandon DeRosa - Phoenix Cluster Shade Structure
Brandon is excited to be apart of this project because he feels it's a huge stepping stone for making our little village stand out and become more comfortable. He also feel that the ""Phoenix Cluster"" is a perfect place to house future entertainment projects and also become a key gathering spot for the village.

What We Need & What You Get
Our Hopeful BudgetOur overall village budget is $8,750, while our IndieGoGo goal is only $2500. We've raised, and plan to raise the rest of our budget with local events and further fund raising!! While each of our main projects did apply for Apogaea art grants, none of them received funding during the first round. We are hopeful that some funding will be granted during round two, however the maximum that we may receive is <$599 per project. Due to our lack of funding we had to reduce our original budget of $16,000 to ensure we could cover the most pertinent items while still offering an all encompassing community experience! Our village will include a custom built stage, large sound rig, quality lighting scheme, shaded dance floor and chill area, interactive art projects & the Octopussy art car! We will offer community gatherings & workshops along with will hosting daily/nightly events that highlight the wide scope of talented performers in our group! The vision is to create a place in spacetime that once you pass through, you will not be able (or want) to escape! 
There are additional expenses required to build a village such as transportation, consumables, equipment rentals, tools, fuel, waste disposal,  general outdoor supplies & space/storage fees.

The Impact!

We are a collective of artists, musicians, performers, builders, organizers, event producers, healers, and teachers. We create spaces for people to thrive! We offer a welcoming home base for people new to the artist/burner community, while helping them channel their passions and expand their knowledge! We have a team of seasoned burners who wish for nothing more than to share our experience & know-how to achieve one grand vision of unity and radical collaboration. We value the 10 principals and upholding the Burning Man culture. Anyone involved in our project will be encouraged to push beyond their comfort zones and explore what they are truly capable of. With the help from professionals in various trades, we offer a stage for others to reach their highest potential!
Our group of lovers, thinkers, builders, creators, and do-ers have also participated in many successful community projects including camps Radically Adequate (Apo 2016), the Octopussy (Apo 2016), Attachment Unavailable (non-Apo 2015), Geological Point of Interest (GPOI) (Apo 2014), Panopolis (Apo 2013), Atom and Eden (Apo 2012), the Dubmarine (Apo 2012), as well as the Temple Build at Apo 2014 in honor of Jenny Kush. 
We seek to partner with our wide spread artist community and create a culture of radical inclusion, participation & radical support by offering our time, talents and knowledge both monetarily and energetically to other camps and projects! We believe in abundance and that when we work together, we can further extend our reach to other like-minded artists and visionaries!

Risks & Challenges
People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.

Being our first year as a collective and having a name unknown to the community at large, we are working diligently as a group to get the word out about our vision. Our first fundraiser was a HUGE success due to the hard work of everyone on our team! However, we have many challenges to face due to the lack of funding received from Apogaea and the short amount of turn around time we have to first get funded and then physically build our projects. We have a large vision but not a lot of wo/man power to make it come alive! 
Through individual conversations within our friends, family and community members, we hope to inspire others to join our grand vision. You know what they say, ""It takes a village"" :-)
We will be having 1-2 additional fundraisers to help raise money & spread awareness. We also value participating in other camps and projects so that we can show our support on behalf of the bigger picture, the Apogaea Regional Burn. With our community outreach and dedicated crew, we hope to share common ground and find ways to work towards a united vision.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>We are a team of dreamers and builders who love having fun. I spent several months drafting art installation ideas and chose 1up as the one that would best fit our vision. I am an avid gamer and an artist, so the concept behind 1up is very personal to me.</p>
<p>The art at Burning Man has always been one of my favorite parts of the event and finally in 2018 I took the leap at building a small scale placed installation. I had such an amazing time with the process that I knew I wanted to go bigger and  better for 2019, so I'm extremely excited and passionate about this project. The 8bit style graphics we're using is one of the most recognized of all vintage gaming and one that will easily invoke smiles in all ages.  </p>
<p>1up will be made of wood and will glow at night with retro 80's style lighting. The piranha plant center piece will be the largest element, reaching a height of around 16'. Other smaller pieces will be waist high, giving you the real feel of being Mario-sized. </p>
<p>Being a small artist with big dreams means we need your help. No matter how great or small your contribution is, every dollar helps and goes directly to this project. We won't be able to make this happen without You!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $6,000 to bring 1up to Black Rock City. Our funding will be split between material costs for items such as wood, electronics, paint, batteries, solar panels, and tools. It will also cover transporting the art to and from the event. If we exceed our initial goal, we will post a stretch goal so we can get a more kick ass sparkly LED lighting setup!</p>
<p>We are thankful for any amount you are willing to donate to us, and every little bit helps. We have created perks as offerings for our supporters at different levels, and if you are interested in redeeming a perk, please click on the ""claim this perk"" button underneath it to donate at that level. You can also choose to donate any amount without claiming a perk. Thank you for your support! </p>

advisor Joy Miller is a long-time resident of Las Cruces. The sunshine and blue
skies brought her here nearly twenty years ago. Joy received her Master’s of
Fine Art from Kent State University and has worked as a curator at university
and city museums ever since. She is also an active community member and has
been on the board of directors for the Las Cruces Downtown Revitalization
organization, the Las Cruces Spay &amp; Neuter Action Program, the Las Cruces
Friends of Chamber Music, and the American Adoption Congress. </p>
<p>Andrianna Natsoulas recently moved to
the area from Southeast Alaska – to a desert from a rainforest. After
graduating with a Master’s of Science in Ecosystems Analysis and Governance from
the University of Warwick in Coventry, England, she landed a job in Washington,
DC. Stayed there for ten years, working for non-profit organizations, including Greenpeace, Public Citizen and Food &amp; Water Watch. She has also helped start or re-launch non-profit groups across the country. In 2009, she took
a break to write a book (Food Voices) and now consults for various organizations locally, nationally and internationally. </p>
<p>Eric Brown has been working in clay for 30
years.  He creates hand built and wheel thrown sculptural and functional
pieces and his work has been featured in galleries and museums across the
country.  Eric earned a bachelor’s of fine arts from Syracuse University
and a master’s of fine arts from New Mexico State University. Eric currently teaches
at New Mexico State University at Alamogordo and maintains a studio in Las
Cruces, New Mexico. Eric will be
overseeing our ceramics program, as well as providing ceramics classes.</p>

<p>We need to get ArtWorks New Mexico off the ground and this campaign contributes to our seed money! In
all, we are looking for about $60,000 for the first months. That will go towards
organizational development, programs, and rent for the physical space. We aim
to raise $10,000 here on IndieGogo, $15,000 through local business support and
$20,000 from generous individual donations and the remainder through start-up
grants. Even if we don’t reach 100%, every cent will go to the initial start-up
expenses. </p>
<p>One of our top goals is to secure a
physical space for two studios, the classroom, gallery and office.
Specifically, we need rent money for our location and costs to develop the first programs. We also have several initial costs, such as the equipment, website,
promotional materials and various fees and licenses. The break-down looks like
this:</p>
<p>$3,000/4 months on Rent &amp; Utilities
(Total: 12,000)</p>
<p>$10,000/4 months for Organizational and Program Development (Total: 40,000)</p>

<span style="""">I grew up in Austin, Texas until I moved to Berlin, Germany just before my 21st birthday. My whole life, I've been surrounded by all kinds of artists and their work.

I grew up in Austin, Texas until I moved to Berlin, Germany just before my 21st birthday. My whole life, I've been surrounded by all kinds of artists and their work. Perhaps through osmosis I've gained an appreciation and love of art as well, and have been working towards this goal for several years. I’ve spent the last month working on a collection of prints made with black India ink and water. Essentially, it's black and white watercolor. I call the style in particular macabre-pop.
This campaign is only the beginning of a vast experience I hope to create for the world. My ultimate goal is to use my art to make people feel things that maybe they have never felt before, while appealing to individual perspectives at the same time. I want to create an experience worth remembering...an experience that will inspire others to create as well and in turn make the world that much more beautiful. With your donation, you become part of that experience.My ultimate dream is to venture into all facets of art and beyond - two-dimensional and three-dimensional work, film, photography, music, performance, etc. Accomplishing this project will be the first step into achieving that dream by allowing me to get my little store off the ground and to financially support myself while I work to create more art. By donating, you will be helping an aspiring artist move past simply dreaming and onto actually creating.What We NeedMy financial goal for this campaign will be $2000. In order of importance, here is a breakdown of where this money will go:

$400 for a used computer to edit my images and manage my online stores 
$100 for a scanner to scan my art into said computer 
$200 for insurance so that I can legally stay here in Berlin! 
If I don't reach my ultimate goal by the end of my campaign, the funds will be put towards each need by order of importance. 
What You GetAt this point you're probably asking yourself, ""What's in it for me?"" Well, this is what you'll get in return for a your donation;If you claim a perk, you can email me at meadows.s23@gmail.com to specify which image you'd prefer.
$10 for a small print of your choice

Opening up the possibilities and exploring new ways of Being. Now we are taking the Next Steps of our Journey.</div>
<div>Our artwork includes Mandalas, Stone paintings, Visionary Symbolic Art. Making music together we span a wide spectrum from psychedelic pop to more meditative instrumental. </div>

came from the busyness and stress I experienced from graduating art school,
having my first child and starting my working career all within three months.  As an artist and woodworker i responded by making a chair that served as a sanctuary during my day to recharge and take 10-15 minutes to gather my thoughts and center my mind on what really mattered. That chair has evolved into what I now call Sabbath.</span></div><div><b>Studies Show-the stats are in</b></div><div><ul>

</div></div>","The IdeaThe idea for Sabbath
came from the busyness and stress I experienced from graduating art school,
having my first child and starting my working career all within three months.  As an artist and woodworker i responded by making a chair that served as a sanctuary during my day to recharge and take 10-15 minutes to gather my thoughts and center my mind on what really mattered. That chair has evolved into what I now call Sabbath.Studies Show-the stats are in

In the U.S, 85.8 percent of males and 66.5 percent of females work more
than 40 hours per week   


Americans work 260 more
hours per year than British workers. 


According to the New York Times Americans left an average
of 9.2 vacation days unused in 2012 

Working in 90-minute intervals turns out to be a prescription for maximizing productivity




Sabbath is For?

Mothers and fathers who wake up at 3 am to crying babies.

CEO's who work 80 hour weeks and need to set new work habits for themselves and their entire company
The general contractor who feels the need to answer emails after 5pm
The hard working auto mechanic
 Executive assistants who find themselves sleeping under their desk
Anyone seeking to balance work and home life
That friend of yours who needs to be told, ""you deserve a break""
Your local coffee shop
Your office

About the Perks
My perks exclusively feature the Sabbath collection itself.  All the perks are priced at a level significantly lower than what Sabbath will retail for once it enters full production.  Now is your chance not only to be among the first Sabbath owners, but also get your Sabbath collection at a crazy discount.


Details about the Sabbath collection
Chair


The Sabbath prototypes are made from ash and feature 2"" wide blue cotton webbing.  The chair is the flag ship, so to speak, of the sabbath collection.  I used steam to bend the backrest, arms, and legs into their curved shape.  The process, called steam bending, involves using a steaming chamber and several bending molds to achieve the strong arches that make for a elegant and sturdy design.  Every joint in the furniture uses mortise and floating tenons to create quality joints like they did it in the old days, but with modern tech that makes the process efficient.
Table

The end table's primary function is to provide a place to stash away your tech device.  Smart phones and the like are essential tools to get the job done, but they can also be a huge distraction when trying to meditate and disconnect for 20 minutes during your work day.  Put your iphone to bed in the end table's leather lined drawer.  The legs like the chair are steam bent and the top features a sliding dovetail on either end, a mark of quality.

Privacy Screen

The privacy screen is intended for folks with large offices or open concept homes.  It allows you the versatility to cut out a little niche in your space.  The arc from the chair and table legs is repeated here and creates a negative space unique to the privacy screen and reminiscent of a pastoral setting.  Escape from the work day, get refreshed and get back to work.  

Wall Hanging ""A Break in Time""


The wall hanging is a beautifully simple work of art I call a ""break in time"".  It's made on the wood lathe where it is turned into a disc.  It is a simple exhibition of wood grain grown over the course of many years and serves as a simple reminder for you to take regular breaks to recharge.
Custom Coaster

There are no two custom coasters alike.  Unlike the rest of the collection the coasters are made from a variety of found wood species.  Each one is inspired by the material itself.  I use my creativity to make a special place for you to have a little ""me"" time with your personal coaster to set your coffee on.
Candle Holder

The candleholder, like a ""break in time"" is made on the wood lathe. There are no two exactly alike.  It features the natural edge of the log bringing a touch of rustic beauty to your meditation space.
Production Coaster

The production coaster is made on a limited scale and features a crack through the growth rings of the wood reminding you to take a break.  I make each one by hand.

I have experienced many ups and downs in the past year, and have recently found solace and inspiration from within. With Persona Somnia, I want to create a tableaux vivant that one can physically step into, as if they were entering into the chaos and beauty of a dream. 
I appreciate your support as I endeavor to bring this project to life. This will be my most cathartic work to date. It is through people like you who support me that my work has a voice.


BIO:

She creates narratives through the manipulation of space and form. It is primal, and transcends language. It’s the most immediate form of communication.

Her work has been featured in national advertisements, fashion editorials, music videos, live performances, television and film. Her costumes have been showcased at national art museums and galleries, including the Guggenheim Museum, Museum of Modern Art in New York, The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and Location One gallery in New York.

what you love best: create your art!
You will never feel alone in growing your art career again!

A wide range of one-on-one personal coaching is available.
Selling your art will become a life-altering, exciting adventure!



We will help you master unstoppable confidence as an artist.




We will be there every step of the way to help your art career grow.




Learn what they haven't taught you...

They did teach you how to use your creativity and
talent to produce unique, wild, and beautiful things. The problem is that
we were never exactly taught how to sell our work to the public. We are dedicated to helping you with these elements of the business
end, which is the stuff that most artists dread. Properly planned and executed,
marketing and branding can be exciting and fun. Knowing how to brand and market your name will direct you down the path
that leads us as artists to that comfort zone that allows us enough time and
money to do what we love the best...creating art.
At ARTOOGLi.com, one statement says it all: WE LOVE HELPING ARTISTS SUCCEED. It is paramount that everyone on our
team understands our mission, believes in it totally, and employs it daily. Assisting you in finding the art career that you desire is our main goal.
And now, after twenty years of designing, employing, and proving our methods...the time is now!
After more than two decades of
art marketing experience and over three years of planning our school, we are
now ready to polish, finalize, and launch the first phase of an educational system that
will significantly help any artist who wishes to join our community.There are two ways that you can help us through this campaign:1.  As a Financial Angel and art lover, your generous support will aid in our first year of life as a school. You have the ability to help us build hope for thousands of artists struggling to find their way in their chosen
career.or
2.  We welcome you as a student (an OOGL), no
matter what level your career is at today. Your membership/tuition is available through Indiegogo for a mere $97. By joining now, today's price is protected for
the first 2 years of membership. As
an added incentive: although you get all of the regular membership benefits
available (effective immediately), the meter on your tuition term will not kick in until our formal
launch later this fall.

ARTOOGLi brings you a future filled with
hope!
The art
markets of the world have shifted drastically in the past few years and as
always, the available educational sources of finding out exactly what you need to
become a professional artist are outdated, unreliable, and generally
impossible to track down.
That is exactly why the ARTOOGLi
community has been created. We are here as an ever-improving art marketing education, coaching and management venue for your betterment. As a registered member of
our community–an ""OOGL""–it is our honor to help you achieve success in
every aspect of the art marketing, talent branding, artistic refinement, and business
education you need.
Whether you're an aspiring artist or a highly accomplished veteran of the industry already, we will endeavor to help you meet
your goals and live your dreams.
What will your aid in funding allow us to do?
After three years of planning and designing our school and systems, we have now begun to gather highly qualified worldwide
experts who will produce or offer hundreds of exclusive ARTOOGLi.com courses and tutorials. Many of these have already been designated to our curriculum. Here are just a few of many categories you will be able to access and employ at your own chosen pace:


MARKETING & SELLING YOUR ART

BRANDING & DEVELOPING YOUR UNIQUE PERSONA
ARTISTIC CONFIDENCE DEVELOPMENT

ONE-ON-ONE ART CAREER CONSULTING

FIRSTHAND MANAGEMENT IN ANY BUSINESS AREA YOU CHOOSE 

HUNDREDS OF PROMO & EVENT IDEAS
BUILDING A POWERFUL PORTFOLIO
EFFECTIVE LETTER-WRITING & EASY-TO-USE TEMPLATES

BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATION PLANNING & SIMPLIFIED TEMPLATES
INFORMATIVE REAL-LIFE CASE STUDIES
LEGAL, COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
& COMMISSION CONTRACTS



These categories will set the direction for the huge inventory of exciting learning tools you'll have within your grasp
to use while building your career.  Each category will
be comprised of easy study courses, tutorials, and services that will meet any artist's
career needs.
What if we don't meet our goal?Don't worry! If we don't reach our entire goal, it will only temporarily hinder the speed at which we are able to add more expert advisers, courses, tutorials, and teachers. ARTOOGLi's foundation has been already built, and it's a solid one. In the end, nothing will stop us from moving forward to aid those artists in need!What you get just for helping us.

Our goal in this campaign is to raise $90,000, which will allow us to form a professional tutorial team. This team will produce 100 of the first and most important art marketing and branding courses in our curriculum. These courses in turn are offered for free to any artist who joins on as a student of our school.
Check out our cool perks, and please keep in mind that you can purchase student memberships for your favorite artists. Just think: you can help a family member or friend find their future and fulfill their dream of becoming a professional artist!
Membership gifts are wonderful because the effect is two-fold: they simultaneously help someone you know personally and our school!
What makes us so unique?Our founding group of artists and art marketers have worked together for over two decades as a team. Over the years, we have found that there is absolutely no single source learning institution that focuses on what an artist needs after they have learned their trade.We know through the hundreds of artists who have approached us over many years that the act of 'doing business' is probably the most intimidating position that they can be put in.That is why we at ARTOOGLi.com, we are 100% committed to producing a school that takes care of these very needs. Even more importantly, we wish to create a community where any artist can find everything they need to gain the confidence necessary for success. We also want to directly extend the help that will enable them to form a career and life-plan that will help them accomplish their goals.With your help, we will be on our way to the second step in a much bigger goal of helping 10,000 artists gain the knowledge that they are not offered anywhere else in a single location: how to be successful in their chosen field.
Risks and challenges.
Aiding ARTOOGLi.com in our quest comes at a very low risk because our school is already in existence and our team is in order. If it should happen that we only reach a portion of our goal we will simply adjust the amount of courses we complete over the next few months. We know our service is in high demand, and we have a tremendous inventory of knowledge and wisdom at our command. We simply want to get it out there just as quickly as we can!
Other ways you can help.
We realize some
people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean we couldn't use your help! So, if you like what we are doing you can help in other ways:

Help us by getting the word out. Tell all of your artist friends or any people you know who have artists in their circles about this Indiegogo campaign and our school, ARTOOGLi.com.

<h3>Whose
lives does art touch?</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As
my studio in LA is outdoors next to a street, I meet people on a daily basis
who stop to tell me about their lives while I am painting or let me know
through a car window that seeing me painting inspires them. Beyond all of the
reasons that I paint for myself, it is exciting to know that the work I do
lifts other people’s spirits and makes them curious about expressing themselves
or brightens their day. Receiving this feedback only fuels me to paint more. There
is a lot of junk going on in the world that most of us </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">can’t</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> fix or change alone and it’s sad …yet we can each be the best
version of ourselves and let that rub off on others.  I get to stand in the sunshine with organic dog treats nearby for the neighbor dogs and make paintings from my
heart and soul. </span><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277282/files/20150308000743-margaret_n_jamie_s.jpg?1425802063"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>(above: Jamie and the late Margaret who visited my studio daily...)</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Not
only is this an amazing project for me, it has opened up opportunities for artists and those in the art community around me. This exhibit has become part of a several exchanges between Italian
and American artists. Alfio is passionate about cross cultural education
through sharing art and has several projects in the works to bring Italian
artists to exhibit in galleries in Los Angeles
and to bring more American artists to Italy.  </span></p>
<h3>What
are the Risks &amp; Challenges?</h3>
<p>I have agreed to
make a lot of paintings that fit together in a cohesive exhibit in a relatively
short amount of time in a country where I <i>don’t</i>
speak the language...yet</p>
<ul>
<li>I have had a weekly
     Italian tutor since January who has been teaching me to read and speak. We
     are working on phrases specific to art and the logistics
     necessary to prepare for the exhibition and reception. </li>
</ul>
<p>In
LA, I cut and build all of the wooden frames that I stretch canvas around and
this takes time and strength. </p>
<ul>
<li>I will plan all of
     the paintings before leaving LA with dimensions in metric so that it will
     be easier to communicate with whoever helps me build the
     frames to stretch the canvas when I arrive.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277280/files/20150308000616-building_s.jpg?1425801976"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since
I work in a series of layers, the time it takes to create a painting varies
from days to months (<i>not </i>including
the planning/inspiration stages).  What
takes the longest amount of time is for the thick textured oil paint to dry
between layers. I often go through several 150-200ml tubes of oil paint on the larger paintings. It is difficult to see the thickness of the texture in a photo. Here is a close up:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277297/files/20150308003536-Detail_on_Avalon-thick_oil_paint_over_acrylic___ink_s.jpg?1425803736"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p>It is crucial that the paintings which need more layers and dry
time get started and finished first as the paintings will need to dry before
being transported to the gallery.  As Italy is more
humid than LA, this could affect the dry time. </p><ul>
<li>In the event that I
     have any difficulty with help, I have the skills to build everything
     myself. It is preferable to have help so that most energy goes towards
     painting. I will have a plan of what tools will get shipped, borrowed or
     obtained when I arrive. My dad got me a portable light weight drill for my birthday to
     take with! Woot woo!!! Look how cute the little drill is! <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1279035/files/20150308161025-new_dril_s.jpg?1425856225"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/></div>","About the Art Project:
There is a potential in
art to lift people’s spirits and connect them to themselves. Help me spread
messages of joy, freedom, and expression through inspiring people with art
internationally! 
I am an artist based
     in Los Angeles.  I create cityscape and coastal paintings
     inspired by the way people’s lives intersect. There is a natural collaboration
     between people that I pay attention to in my work that may on the surface
     look like a depiction of a place.  Yet the energy and layers of hidden
     stories and possibilities in any setting remind us that we all contribute
     to a bigger picture through every action we take and thought we make. 

After years of
     painting and sharing my work in Southern California, I am so honored and
     grateful to be recognized by Alfio Borghese, a prominent art
     critic/curator and artistic director of galleries throughout Italy. He
     has selected my work for a solo exhibition to include 20 or more of my
     paintings at the Villa Comunale di Frosinone. I will go to Italy from May-September 2015 to create and
     exhibit paintings inspired by Los
       Angeles and US scenes to share with Italian
     audiences.  My exhibit, An Eclectic Perspective or in
     Italian Una Prospettiva Eclettica from
     August 24-September 6, 2015 is part of The Festival of Visual Contemporary
     Arts in Frosinone near Rome. 
(above photo: with Alfio Borghese upon meeting at the Oceanside Museum (OMA) opening reception in December 2014 for the touring international exhibit, California Dreaming: An International Portrait of Southern California juried by LA art critic/curator Peter Frank, and museum directors Daniel Foster & Drew
Oberjuerge.  My painting is one of the 54 artworks that traveled to Italy in October of 2014 and has returned to exhibit at OMA and the Riverside Museum of Art)
  
As navigating the
     logistics of constructing and creating this many paintings in unique
     dimensions in another culture away from my studio is such a HUGE undertaking...It
     would mean so much to me to have your support with additional expenses so
     that I can focus energy towards painting and representing LA and the US well.

Art Gift Certificates!

Do you see brightening your home or office with an original painting? Investing in an Art Gift Certificate now gets you a bonus towards your future selection! Art Gift Certificates includes the Art Adventure Combo Fun Pack! You can choose art on-line or if you are in the Los Angeles area arrange a studio visit. This is an exception as most art must be purchased through a gallery, art dealer, retail location or interior designer.

This is valid for available paintings that I have created or intend to create.   Paintings represented by galleries in exhibitions or slated for an exhibition do Not apply while the painting is in the care of a gallery. Certificate  may Not be used towards shipping or sales tax costs.What will happen with the funds if I don't make the goal on Indiegogo?
This project has been announced in the Italian newspaper and I
     bought my plane ticket…so this project will happen! 
In whatever amount, your contributions will make this project happen! When the logistics get covered I can focus more creative energy towards making the paintings. When I return to LA without having incurred debt, there will be more time to make paintings to share with the world and your energy will be in those paintings too!The below article speaks of  the artists who will be featured in The Festival of Visual Contempory Arts at Villa Comunale di Frosinone. Do you see see my painting?
How will funds be used if the initial goal is exceeded?


Satellite trips in Italy or Europe to promote this exhibit and gain inspiration for NEW paintings to make upon returning to the US (this will include making live sketches & taking photos)


Transportation for potential opportunities to exhibit the works
     further throughout Italy or Europe as my host is the artistic director for several other galleries. If I wish to bring the paintings back to the US, the cost is estimated over $13,000.  As of yet the plan is to leave the paintings from this exhibit in Europe under Alfio's care for further exhibits in Italy. 

Editing together images and video footage or stills of the painting adventure in Italy 


Creating a coffee table book of my paintings upon returning with a special section featuring the paintings created in the Italian exhibit





Whose
lives does art touch?
As
my studio in LA is outdoors next to a street, I meet people on a daily basis
who stop to tell me about their lives while I am painting or let me know
through a car window that seeing me painting inspires them. Beyond all of the
reasons that I paint for myself, it is exciting to know that the work I do
lifts other people’s spirits and makes them curious about expressing themselves
or brightens their day. Receiving this feedback only fuels me to paint more. There
is a lot of junk going on in the world that most of us can’t fix or change alone and it’s sad …yet we can each be the best
version of ourselves and let that rub off on others.  I get to stand in the sunshine with organic dog treats nearby for the neighbor dogs and make paintings from my
heart and soul. (above: Jamie and the late Margaret who visited my studio daily...)Not
only is this an amazing project for me, it has opened up opportunities for artists and those in the art community around me. This exhibit has become part of a several exchanges between Italian
and American artists. Alfio is passionate about cross cultural education
through sharing art and has several projects in the works to bring Italian
artists to exhibit in galleries in Los Angeles
and to bring more American artists to Italy.  
What
are the Risks & Challenges?
I have agreed to
make a lot of paintings that fit together in a cohesive exhibit in a relatively
short amount of time in a country where I don’t
speak the language...yet

I have had a weekly
     Italian tutor since January who has been teaching me to read and speak. We
     are working on phrases specific to art and the logistics
     necessary to prepare for the exhibition and reception. 

In
LA, I cut and build all of the wooden frames that I stretch canvas around and
this takes time and strength. 

I will plan all of
     the paintings before leaving LA with dimensions in metric so that it will
     be easier to communicate with whoever helps me build the
     frames to stretch the canvas when I arrive.


Since
I work in a series of layers, the time it takes to create a painting varies
from days to months (not including
the planning/inspiration stages).  What
takes the longest amount of time is for the thick textured oil paint to dry
between layers. I often go through several 150-200ml tubes of oil paint on the larger paintings. It is difficult to see the thickness of the texture in a photo. Here is a close up: It is crucial that the paintings which need more layers and dry
time get started and finished first as the paintings will need to dry before
being transported to the gallery.  As Italy is more
humid than LA, this could affect the dry time. 
In the event that I
     have any difficulty with help, I have the skills to build everything
     myself. It is preferable to have help so that most energy goes towards
     painting. I will have a plan of what tools will get shipped, borrowed or
     obtained when I arrive. My dad got me a portable light weight drill for my birthday to
     take with! Woot woo!!! Look how cute the little drill is! 
I also like to wear an empty tool belt...
The tool belt is too heavy with the tools in it...but it amuses me to wear the tool belt. I feel like such a tough worker... debating whether to take an empty tool belt to Italy...it is part of my process.


This is the first project I have taken on of this scale
overseas…although I have completed hundreds of works and promoted many art
exhibits in a variety of settings. I have a good deal of experience living and
working overseas in other capacities.

In 2012, I went to Dongguan, China for a commission of one painting, which taught me that making art in another culture requires being patient, resourceful and equipped with a spirit of enthusiasm & adventure…which I have! There is also a mental attitude of flexibility that is needed because it is not possible to go through the day in one’s normal routine…There is so much to learn along the way. (above: I had a following of security guards who visited me each day to check the progress of the painting.  I met probably a hundred people a day as I was situated next to a busy intersection.) 
In college and right after I had the opportunity to live and work with children on U.S.
     Military bases in Okinawa, Japan, Vicenza,
     Italy (luckily, I got to enjoy the pizza & gelato before I had food sensitivities) and Wiesbaden, Germany.  I also participated in various theatre
     projects in Gdansk, Poland and worked for U.S. Embassies in Tokyo, Japan
     & Bejing, China.
     I welcome reconnecting with the part of myself that thrives in another
     culture.

$400 will go to stickers and a logo tee that will be used for both the rewards and a table items, also a banner and business cards. 
The remaining $200 will cover Indiegogo fees. 
Awesome rewards for every donation made!
This is a massive step forward in pursuing a career in art. For me it's not about becoming rich or famous but instead about striving to survive with my passion to create. There are no guarantees in the art world and the struggle of an artist is real, but we do it for the love of it. I sincerely thank anyone who read this far, even if you can't help with funds sharing this campaign on the social media outlets with your friends or anyone you think might have an interest could make all the difference in helping to reach this goal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This style of photography has never been tried before, although Gigapixel photography has been around for a while and large panoramic photos of crowds have been seen before. FibonARTcci is different: we are taking aerial portrait photographs on a global scale.</p>
<p>We have teamed up with one of the best Gigapixel photographs in the world, Tom Mills.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">How you can Help</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We need your help to raise <b>£17,000</b> to complete the next 5 FibonARTcci photos. These photos <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">cannot happen without your support both in attendance and </span>financially.</p>
<p>To kick-start the next phase of the project, the money raised from this campaign will go towards four vital pieces of the puzzle:</p>
<p>1. The entrance fee to the Bristol International Ballon Fiesta 2015.</p>
<p>2. The services of a world class Gigapixel photographer who will take the FibonARTcci portrait photographs.</p>
<p>2. An aerial platform (cherry picker/crane) (3 days hire) from where the photographs will be taken.</p>
<p>3. 1500 coloured T-Shirts with printed FibonARTcci logo.  </p>
<p>Every picture is colour coordinated and to guarantee the success of the photos, everyone has to be wearing the same coloured top, however any variation of the base colour for that particular photo is fine.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Perks</h1>
<div>Our Perks are a big part of FibonARTcci and we would like to share them with you on our FibonARTcci YouTube Channel. </div>
<div>Any money raised above the total for this event will be used to help the next photos. </div>
<br/>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>There are some associated risks for this type of photography, the main risk is cost. The amount we need to raise is for a 2-day photo shoot, which means hire rates for 3-days, this includes setting up the crane and the cameras on the Friday. If for some reason we do not reach the £17,000 target and we only attended the festival for one day, we would still be able to able to take some photos, just not all of them. The important thing to remember is, we will take as many photos as possible.</p>
<p>The second risk is the Great British Weather. Rain will not stop play, but thunder and lightning most definitely will, as well as high winds. Our photographer will be in a crane<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> 30 - 40 metres above the crowd, so stability is very important. If for some reason the weather turns bad, we will still use the money raised to take the photos, but it will be at another event during the summer.</span></p>

</div></div>","What does a MILLION look like?

or to be more precise what does
 ONE MILLION people look like?

FibonARTcci will answer that question.

The overall aim of the project is to take a portrait photograph of ONE MILLION people. 
How?

It would be almost impossible to just go out in the world and take this photo, so we are going to use a staged approach to help use reach our target and build the world's largest art project along the way.


We are taking a series of 31 gigapixel photographs, the number of people in each photo increases in size following the first 31 numbers the Fibonacci sequence - from 1 person, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... until we reach the first number over one million people! 1,346,269 people.  

In total, with the completion of the 31st image,
3.5 million people from around the world would have helped make The FibonARTcci
Spiral. 

     FibonARTcci will connect people from different sporting events and festivals across the world by involving the audience in a completely new concept of entertainment. 

As well as having a great time with family and friends, these people will share in the technology and innovation of Gigapixel portrait photographs. FibonARTcci aims to  travel the world to take these photographs as we want to include as many people as possible from Europe to Africa, from the Americas to Asia, New Zealand and Australia.                               The viewing platform for the photos will be web based. This will allow the viewer to ZOOM into the photos to see individual faces, as if you are still standing right next to them!  That is the  power of Giga Pixel Technology! When the final photo has been taken, we will exhibit the whole FibonARTcci Spiral on a massive digital wall, with interactive consoles, that will allow the viewer to enter a name or number linked to a geo-tag and zoom straight into that person.
Each FibonARTcci photograph will be added and stitched around the very first photo to form a spiral image that will ultimately form ‘The FibonARTcci Spiral’. 



Each person will become part of a unique community of over 3.5 million people from around the world. The people in the FibonARTcci photos will belong to an exclusive club of World Record Breaking Photography.
The Plan
We have just received the news that FibonARTcci has been accepted into the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta 2015, 6 - 9 August. An estimated 500,000 are expected to attend over the 4 days of the festival. This is a massive boost to the project and we are very confident in achieving our goals.

Our Goals
We are  planning to take the next Five Gigapixel portrait photographs from 89 to 610 people at the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. These photographs will help us complete 15 of the 31 FibonARTcci photographs.

       


FibonARTcci is the Largest 
Art Project in the World!
FibonARTcci is all about people, it's all about you! Innovation is also key to this ambitious project:
This style of photography has never been tried before, although Gigapixel photography has been around for a while and large panoramic photos of crowds have been seen before. FibonARTcci is different: we are taking aerial portrait photographs on a global scale.
We have teamed up with one of the best Gigapixel photographs in the world, Tom Mills. Tom already has world record breaking Gigapixel photos under his belt and was part of the team that took the record-breaking 320 Gigapixel interactive picture of London. 








Our Achievements

I self funded the first 10 photos at the launch event in Cardiff. The event was an amazing success and I can honestly say that everyone who took part had an awesome time.
      
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everybody again for helping me create FibonARTcci Cardiff and I hope you can join us at our next event, FibonARTcci Bristol. 

How you can Help

We need your help to raise £17,000 to complete the next 5 FibonARTcci photos. These photos cannot happen without your support both in attendance and financially.
To kick-start the next phase of the project, the money raised from this campaign will go towards four vital pieces of the puzzle:
1. The entrance fee to the Bristol International Ballon Fiesta 2015.
2. The services of a world class Gigapixel photographer who will take the FibonARTcci portrait photographs.
2. An aerial platform (cherry picker/crane) (3 days hire) from where the photographs will be taken.
3. 1500 coloured T-Shirts with printed FibonARTcci logo.  
Every picture is colour coordinated and to guarantee the success of the photos, everyone has to be wearing the same coloured top, however any variation of the base colour for that particular photo is fine.
Perks
Our Perks are a big part of FibonARTcci and we would like to share them with you on our FibonARTcci YouTube Channel. 
Any money raised above the total for this event will be used to help the next photos. 


Risks

There are some associated risks for this type of photography, the main risk is cost. The amount we need to raise is for a 2-day photo shoot, which means hire rates for 3-days, this includes setting up the crane and the cameras on the Friday. If for some reason we do not reach the £17,000 target and we only attended the festival for one day, we would still be able to able to take some photos, just not all of them. The important thing to remember is, we will take as many photos as possible.
The second risk is the Great British Weather. Rain will not stop play, but thunder and lightning most definitely will, as well as high winds. Our photographer will be in a crane 30 - 40 metres above the crowd, so stability is very important. If for some reason the weather turns bad, we will still use the money raised to take the photos, but it will be at another event during the summer.



Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just cannot contribute financially, but that does not mean they cannot help:
We are looking for FibonARTcci Ambassadors and Event Volunteers.

Without a function, the pools had slowly, over four decades turned into ruin and became covered in litter.

This year along with the amazing music program and the mural art we are putting a strong focus on raising awareness about environmental protection. We are organising  lectures and a play for kids with a goal to educate the youth about the importance of protecting our environment. With our team of volunteers we will be conducting the removal of the litter from the surrounding areas. Our vision is to further develop this area and become a cultural hub with many events organised throughout the year.</p><h3>How you can help us and what we offer</h3><p>Our two main priorities this year are safety for all our visitors and environmental protection. Most of the funds collected this year will be invested in those two priorities. Since this year the greatest number of visitors of all ages is expected, maximizing the safety and security is very important. The swimming  pools are up to 3m deep and without water they must be fenced off. Some of the collected funds will be invested in renting a fence that is necessary to provide safe access to 1st festival. According to the assessment, we will need 600m of fence at a 5 $ per m price which leads to a calculation of $ 3000. In addition to entertainment, our second priority offers educational activities. Lectures about environmental protection will be held by some eminent Serbian instructors and conducting Eco - activities will educate young people about very important matter nowadays. Required sum of money for the overall implementation of the ecological part of the project is $ 2000.</p><ul></ul><p>We made a lot of presents for our donors with festival’s logo. We have perks of 10, 25, 50, 100, 485 and 900$, and every of them is hiding surprise. We will find the best way to thank you, and we will do that maybe even personal! Support us because every support is priceless.</p><p> If the funds, received through this campaign, overcome our goal it will go towards renting the fence, hiring extra staff and adequately compensating performers and artists. </p><h3>Our goals</h3><p>The key to the festival’s success has been the development of a strong brand identity, and unique large-scale commissions that have driven word-of-mouth with a focus on quality and experience. Importantly, the choice and shape of the program is designed to have elements that will appeal and reach out to different audience demographics – from ‘culture vultures’ to people who would not usually attend arts events.</p><p>We are slowly building a strong reputation  and every year we are receiving larger grants and more generous sponsorships. Our goal for Lost &amp; Found festival is to become a recognisable brand with a big community where we can present all the potentials our region have to offer.  </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527541679/k6s81ruz0sxqp5dqmnrc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Risk and challenges</h3><p>In our first two years, one of the biggest challenges meant listening to two impulses: our own dreams for what the festival might become, and the desires of our audiences and artists. Sometimes those two ideals conflict. Most of the time they’re hard to deliver and it’s always chasing that perfection.  Accepting you’ll never get there is what keeps you getting better and accepting “The Long Game” (alternative title: You’ll Never Get Rich Doing This) means not adopting smash and grab policies, not treating people as income streams, and always honouring the intention. We are constantly reminding ourselves why are we doing this and that is what keep us going toward perfection.</p><p><br/>We are on a good path to achieve our goal however we need your help.

Less is known about our regions great natural gems such as Mountain Stol ( 18km), Lazar's Canyon and its surrounding caves ( 16km ), Lake Bor ( 18km ) and hot springs in Brestovacka Banja where our festival is located.  http://www.borizvazduha.rs/In a  town without an established annual event a group of like minded friends had recognized a great  potential for tourism and made a brave decision to organize a festival in 2016.As a location the organizers have chosen the abandoned swimming pools that where in use for only 3 years. Without a function, the pools had slowly, over four decades turned into ruin and became covered in litter. The name  for the event came naturally from the idea of converting this area.  After two successful events in 2016 and 2017, the swimming pools have been transformed in to an open air art gallery that welcomes guests all year round. This year along with the amazing music program and the mural art we are putting a strong focus on raising awareness about environmental protection. We are organising  lectures and a play for kids with a goal to educate the youth about the importance of protecting our environment. With our team of volunteers we will be conducting the removal of the litter from the surrounding areas. Our vision is to further develop this area and become a cultural hub with many events organised throughout the year.How you can help us and what we offerOur two main priorities this year are safety for all our visitors and environmental protection. Most of the funds collected this year will be invested in those two priorities. Since this year the greatest number of visitors of all ages is expected, maximizing the safety and security is very important. The swimming  pools are up to 3m deep and without water they must be fenced off. Some of the collected funds will be invested in renting a fence that is necessary to provide safe access to 1st festival. According to the assessment, we will need 600m of fence at a 5 $ per m price which leads to a calculation of $ 3000. In addition to entertainment, our second priority offers educational activities. Lectures about environmental protection will be held by some eminent Serbian instructors and conducting Eco - activities will educate young people about very important matter nowadays. Required sum of money for the overall implementation of the ecological part of the project is $ 2000.We made a lot of presents for our donors with festival’s logo. We have perks of 10, 25, 50, 100, 485 and 900$, and every of them is hiding surprise. We will find the best way to thank you, and we will do that maybe even personal! Support us because every support is priceless. If the funds, received through this campaign, overcome our goal it will go towards renting the fence, hiring extra staff and adequately compensating performers and artists. Our goalsThe key to the festival’s success has been the development of a strong brand identity, and unique large-scale commissions that have driven word-of-mouth with a focus on quality and experience. Importantly, the choice and shape of the program is designed to have elements that will appeal and reach out to different audience demographics – from ‘culture vultures’ to people who would not usually attend arts events.We are slowly building a strong reputation  and every year we are receiving larger grants and more generous sponsorships. Our goal for Lost & Found festival is to become a recognisable brand with a big community where we can present all the potentials our region have to offer.    Risk and challengesIn our first two years, one of the biggest challenges meant listening to two impulses: our own dreams for what the festival might become, and the desires of our audiences and artists. Sometimes those two ideals conflict. Most of the time they’re hard to deliver and it’s always chasing that perfection.  Accepting you’ll never get there is what keeps you getting better and accepting “The Long Game” (alternative title: You’ll Never Get Rich Doing This) means not adopting smash and grab policies, not treating people as income streams, and always honouring the intention. We are constantly reminding ourselves why are we doing this and that is what keep us going toward perfection.We are on a good path to achieve our goal however we need your help. Please share our idea with your friends, everyone who donates can expect an authentic gift as a thank you for your support.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Andrea Tsang Jackson is an award-winning quilter, textile artist and designer; Meaghan Smith is an award-winning songwriter and musician. Together we've created <i>Our Song, Your Reflection</i> to celebrate community through music and craft. The project gets to the core of what makes us tick as creatives — connecting people and connecting with people through our art. The campaign invites contributors to be a part of the ""Your Reflection"" music video, to increase offerings associated with the release of the song and the quilt pattern, and to celebrate the ""us"" in our communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is $20,000 CAD to cover the project costs. These include the music, video, and photography production; quilt design, sample making, pattern development and testing, sourcing 34 different fabrics to make fabric kits; marketing photography and extra campaign perks. We want to ensure that every person that is a part of the process is compensated for their efforts.</p>
<p>Through the campaign, you can get the song and pre-order the pattern and/or fabric kit. Other special campaign perks include a limited-edition enamel pin, a lyric art print, coffee dates with Andrea and quilting retreat instruction. These offerings will not be available to the public after the campaign ends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>When Andrea entered the quilting world in 2016, she found a community of supportive and generous people who find joy in their work and through connecting with other quilters. She wanted to draw that out and highlight what that means to her to find a place where you belong. Through this collaboration with Meaghan, she is able to celebrate it in a unique way — with words, music and a design that expresses exactly the sentiment that many people feel. The unique aspect of the project is the way that people can share images of their own community through the music video. We want to hear your stories about how being part of a community has impacted you — your quilting guild, your sewing friends, your hockey team, your running club, your family, whoever your people are.</p>
</div><div><h3>Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Gift the song or another perk to your friend, your quilty aunt, your crafty BFF, your people. Share the campaign with people outside the quilting world. We know that they have similar feelings about their communities and would love to hear their stories, too.</p>
<p>Finding a place where you belong is not an everyday thing. Let's celebrate the ""us"" in our lives.</p>

It resonates passion, beauty and intensity beyond words. Centred around the concept of creation and the act of creating. Like in religious tradition the one that creates is divine and of divine intention. Strictly focusing on inspiration, symbolism, philosophy, creativity and imagination. </p><p>The double crosses symbolise the void or the abyss.<br/><strong>""If you look long enough into the abyss, the abyss begins to look back through you."" </strong><br/>- Friedrich Nietzsche</p><p>The abyss is a kind of monster, the monster of complete cynicism and true nihilism - the empty man that post-modernism seems to favour. Pursuing an utter lack of beauty, life values and aesthetics leaves one empty, and perhaps incapable of recovering one's artistic nature.

It resonates passion, beauty and intensity beyond words. Centred around the concept of creation and the act of creating. Like in religious tradition the one that creates is divine and of divine intention. Strictly focusing on inspiration, symbolism, philosophy, creativity and imagination. The double crosses symbolise the void or the abyss.""If you look long enough into the abyss, the abyss begins to look back through you."" - Friedrich NietzscheThe abyss is a kind of monster, the monster of complete cynicism and true nihilism - the empty man that post-modernism seems to favour. Pursuing an utter lack of beauty, life values and aesthetics leaves one empty, and perhaps incapable of recovering one's artistic nature. 'Arte Divina' greatly values beauty as an essential virtue of art. The double cross is a symbol that rebels against the apathy and the defeatist culture and post-modernism gave birth to this trend. When I was at University studying art and design we were taught how to deconstruct and to break down values, leaving no room for aesthetics or emotions with no appreciation for beauty.""In an age of ugliness, a work of beauty is an act of defiance. At any time between 1750 and 1930, if you asked educated people to describe the aim of poetry, art or music, they would have replied “beauty.” And if you had asked for the point of that you would have learned that beauty is a value, as important as truth and goodness.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Abbey Hunter and ever since I graduated with a degree in metalsmithing, I've wanted to open a public metals studio for artists. I saw the need for it while in college and wanted to find a way where other artists can continue having a space with not only access to tools but also a great community for support. We had an incubation period at a local community space for a few years but we needed to branch out and get our own building!</p>
<p>The Hot Spot is incredibly important to myself as well as our growing number of metalsmiths here in Grand Rapids, MI. This campaign will help bring our new space to completion now that we have our own brick and mortar location. It will finish our lower level which is currently down to the studs. We can then officially open our doors to the public and maintain business studio hours where folks can rent a bench and have complete access by the hour or monthly memberships. Classes and workshops will be available for those wanting to learn the basics of jewelry making or expand upon more advanced techniques. Finally, this will be a place where we offer gallery space to show off the work of our studio artists and outside metalsmiths as well.</p>
<p>It is my absolute goal to make this the perfect community space for metalsmiths and creatives to gather, network, and learn. This is a space to hone in on the business side of being a professional artist. Access and education to the business side of being an independent artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $20,000 to get this space proper and up to code. Our lower level is completely gutted down to the stud frames. A lot needs to be done but we have many helping hands.</p>

<li>Electrical for all walls ($3,000)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've had my studio growing since 2012. In that time we've grown in members and those interested in learning more about metalsmithing. It's time now for our studio to have an even greater place in the community of arts here in Grand Rapids. This is the first major leap to a start of something better. Making it a success here means that our studio can have the driving force down the road for new avenues of education by having our studio support local initiatives with the youth through the arts. Our studio wants individuals to gain momentum and knowledge for setting their career as an artist. This will involve working with other programs in the community for business education and the arts such as GROW, Avenue for the Arts, The Creative Many, UICA, GRAM, WMCAT, Michigan Small Business Development Center and others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As an artist and entrepreneur, I've had to take on a lot of roles to maintain and grow my businesses. I've gone through local programs for business education and events put on through the Avenue for the Arts that cater specifically towards artists who want to learn marketing, accounting, and procuring the ideal business plan. It's frightening to always take the next step, especially ones as risky as starting up a brick and mortar business. Luckily, I have great mentors that keep me informed and also a fantastic support team that wants to see myself and this studio succeed. A lot of makers rely on this space and what I offer to make a living and loving career of their own with what they create.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best way to help if you can't donate is by spreading the word! We would love it if everyone could spread the word of our campaign and our studio. This includes email lists, Facebook, Instagram, word of mouth, even Twitter. </p>

</div><p>Hello to all the beautiful people who have taken the time to watch my video and scroll down to read this page. Thank you for the time you've already invested!</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><h3>With your help</h3><p>In October 2015, I will travel 4,000 miles to Chicago where I will travel to Detroit by bus. The journey will take us down to Detroit to meet with Detroit locals and artists/photographers who are currently investing time and energy and love and passion into a new vision of Detroit. In January 2016 I will fly, again by myself, to Chicago and travel down to Detroit to conclude the work after 8 months of collaboration and engaging with Detroit artists, musicians and innovators. The book will be printed and sent out to backers in April/May 2016.</p><p>I am going to be shooting images that will show Detroit as the inspiring hub of creativity that it is. Did you know that Detroit houses a park that is bigger than Central Park and is on an island between two countries?! And the Eastern Market that caters for 45,000 people each Saturday. Yes 45 THOUSAND! The Detroit institute of Arts beckons as it houses the 6th best art collection in the world. The architecture is something that should be celebrated, yes there are ruins everywhere but there is also the Guardian building, a 40-floor classic art deco skyscraper, the Fisher Building - built almost entirely out of marble and granite and the Grand Army of the Republic castle!</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>I'm a photographer, gaffer, film maker and visual artist.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433867232/abc8yadofikiawo8b8r0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 404.8469601677149px; height: 404px;""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><h3><br/></h3><p>A brain injury and broken back almost took my life in December of 2011. My injury has left me with a seriously diminished ability to retain memory or to multi task. In fact I was released from the care of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Centre after more than three years of care and support just a few months ago and that was a huge and scary step for me. </p><p>I have spent months talking to other artists and photographers and purveyors of positive action in Detroit and am super excited to meet all of them and see a side of Detroit that would be closed to me without these beautiful connections.</p><p>Just one example of the amazing connections that this work has made happen is the music on the video. During my last trip to Milwaukee I met some amazing creative people, whilst looking for music for this work one of my new wonderful friends from Milwaukee suggested this band Lights Alive who are from Chicago. After talking to Devon Carson about my work the band generously offered me use of this track which is just perfect for the project in Detroit. A million Thank You's to them for this! You can find them at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/detroit-the-fight-within/edit/lightsalive.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LightsAlive</a>.<br/></p><p><b>If this campaign reaches £4,300 acclaimed photographer and videographer Lawrence Wheeler will be flying out with me in January and along with the footage that I take in July we will be making a short documentary film that we will enter into film festivals. All backers will be given the opportunity to see this film exclusively before it reaches the public domain!</b><br/></p><p>Detroit is so well known for its demise, for its collapse and for its degradation and ruins but my photographs will be showing the inspiration, positivity and true grit soul of Detroit and will include the production of a gallery exhibition of photographs, a photo book, aerial photography and a lasting collaborative relationship between the London and Detroit Art scene.</p><p><b>WHY Detroit?</b></p><p><b><b>I see many parallels between my recovery and the beauty in Detroit. People love to dwell in negativity-it seems to be the human condition. I was told I might not walk again, I didn't believe it and here I am. Yes I was broken but now I am living my life albeit in a new way but life is AMAZING! And Detroit is home to a hub of positive and strong people who love their city for good reason.</b></b></p><p><b>I hope that my journey will inspire other people, especially survivors of TBI who are grappling with their own versions of a ""new normal.""</b></p><p>After my injury I never really lost faith that I would continue to explore the world with my camera. I still connect to the world through a camera – I just have a different perspective, a perspective that proves positivity and hope can be found in any situation.</p><b>Every day is therapy: Some days my hands shake too much to drive and photograph-on these days I edit. Some days editing takes me two or three times the amount of time it would have taken me before the injury-on these days I learn patience.</b><br/><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I’ve worked extraordinarily hard since my accident to not only recover physically but to relearn how to live daily life as a single mum to my two children, I had to relearn how to do the shopping, how to cook a meal and how to plan food for a week. </span><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433868515/yvfiq19zlrdbvq7lkb9b.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 290.43689320388347px; height: 193px;""/></p>Me and my children a year and a half after the accident.<div>

<p>This link is great for some medical information <a href=""https://www.headway.org.uk/About-traumatic-brain-injury.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">about traumatic brain injury</a>.</p>
<p>After the injury my initial focus was on walking again, then on being able to deal with every day life by myself. It sounds simple but even making phone calls or writing a shopping list was enough to cause my brain to shut down resulting in psychogenic seizures for the first few years. I can’t do everything that I could do before the injury but I have overcome obstacles that I never would have thought I would encounter in my life.<br/></p>
<p>This link is a great introduction to the effects of a brain injury and could be a good place to start for anyone looking for more information or support. <a href=""https://www.headway.org.uk/Effects-of-brain-injury.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Headway</a>.</p>

<p>I am fiercely passionate about my freedom to be creative and about my right to live my life with a huge amount of positivity. These two desires are the reason I am still a photographer, film maker and artist today. With your support I can follow my dream to document a Detroit that is fighting back to live again with hope and creativity and through this I can inspire other survivors of brain injuries. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My work really only stopped for a year or two, since the injury I have been back to Paris to photograph for some photo stories on culture, London and Milton Keynes for some work with youth and I have most recently spent time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where I have started a body of work that will be ongoing for a few years and focuses on juxtaposing the visual state of disrepair  (Rust. Rust EVERYWHERE. Dilapidated houses. Bad Graffiti. Cars that are shot to bits...)  with the elevated scenes of pure beauty in landscape on the lake and finding joyous moments of humanity.</span><br/></p>

I have put all of my time and money into this project for many months now.</div>

<div>It is through the support of generous donors, voluntary help and sponsors that this journey will be possible. The funds raised through this campaign will be used to cover expenses for my flights from the UK, gas, a driver and a photo assistant for 21 days, plus a little towards food and lodging for the crew-we have some wonderful offers of accommodation in Detroit for the July part of the trip and I’m planning on eating as cheaply as possible in the spirit of supporting growth in Detroit. In reality the cost of the two trips could become pretty high, I am funding all equipment myself and am not taking a single penny for my time or work at any point over the next 8 months, so I am hoping for some in-kind donations to fill the gap. I know that this work is the beginning of something huge and I feel utterly blessed to be able to give my time and energy to this body of work. I’m truly excited to use my unique perspective as an English/Irish bred artist who has survived a traumatic injury and I’m honoured to be making this book of images showing Detroit as a city to look towards for emerging innovation and soulful belief in the Arts.<br/>

<p>Access to the blog will be via an email list where I will be writing several times a month, each week for some of the project.

I will also be investing in the students that I work with. Not only will they get to spend a day with me and see my working practise (which is by far the quickest way to learn anything) but they will also sit with me while I edit and I will stay in touch with them after I leave Detroit in July and be on hand to answer questions they might have beforeI come back in January when they will have the chance to meet up with me again.

<p></p>
<div><div>The book design could take longer than scheduled, I am entirely basing my book cover image choice on a voting system that all of my backers will be a part of.<p></p>
<p>There are many challenges that I may face when coming to photograph any areas of decay in Detroit, the areas are dangerous, the situation in Detroit means that people make money where they can and that can include literally cutting out the metal work from the structures of buildings. I plan on doing most, if not all, of my urban exploring with local artists and residents who know the area well. I have done a lot of urban exploring here in England, navigating unsafe structures and have learned to do the unsafe things as safely as possible. As with everything in life there are risks and always will be - anything that can be done without a risk is not going to reap as rich a reward and I’m happy to take on board these risks. Telling this story is so important to me and making excellent images has been my life for a very long time now.</p>
<p>Artists are mercurial and while I have many liaisons lined up already I am very open to the willow like nature of life and if things change then I will change too. There is a steady stream of conscious artistic people who are open to connecting and sharing their view with me. All of this will be documented in the email updates.</p>
<p>Equipment could break. It happens - more than some people realise when you are taking on urban exploration. I have a second line of equipment and very good insurance. </p>
<p>The whole project could be slowed down if I get caught with brain fog or other post brain injury symptoms like seizures (less likely as I know how to look after myself - but it could still happen) or if I (more likely) try to do too much too fast. I am ready for this, I deal with the symptoms every day of my life - dealing with it while I’m on this project will be much the same. If I do get caught up with symptoms I will take a little longer, simplify the way I’m doing things and tackle it gently, I will also be very honest about this in my updates.</p>

</div></div>","Hello to all the beautiful people who have taken the time to watch my video and scroll down to read this page. Thank you for the time you've already invested!With your helpIn October 2015, I will travel 4,000 miles to Chicago where I will travel to Detroit by bus. The journey will take us down to Detroit to meet with Detroit locals and artists/photographers who are currently investing time and energy and love and passion into a new vision of Detroit. In January 2016 I will fly, again by myself, to Chicago and travel down to Detroit to conclude the work after 8 months of collaboration and engaging with Detroit artists, musicians and innovators. The book will be printed and sent out to backers in April/May 2016.I am going to be shooting images that will show Detroit as the inspiring hub of creativity that it is. Did you know that Detroit houses a park that is bigger than Central Park and is on an island between two countries?! And the Eastern Market that caters for 45,000 people each Saturday. Yes 45 THOUSAND! The Detroit institute of Arts beckons as it houses the 6th best art collection in the world. The architecture is something that should be celebrated, yes there are ruins everywhere but there is also the Guardian building, a 40-floor classic art deco skyscraper, the Fisher Building - built almost entirely out of marble and granite and the Grand Army of the Republic castle!I'm a photographer, gaffer, film maker and visual artist.A brain injury and broken back almost took my life in December of 2011. My injury has left me with a seriously diminished ability to retain memory or to multi task. In fact I was released from the care of the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Centre after more than three years of care and support just a few months ago and that was a huge and scary step for me. I have spent months talking to other artists and photographers and purveyors of positive action in Detroit and am super excited to meet all of them and see a side of Detroit that would be closed to me without these beautiful connections.Just one example of the amazing connections that this work has made happen is the music on the video. During my last trip to Milwaukee I met some amazing creative people, whilst looking for music for this work one of my new wonderful friends from Milwaukee suggested this band Lights Alive who are from Chicago. After talking to Devon Carson about my work the band generously offered me use of this track which is just perfect for the project in Detroit. A million Thank You's to them for this! You can find them at LightsAlive.If this campaign reaches £4,300 acclaimed photographer and videographer Lawrence Wheeler will be flying out with me in January and along with the footage that I take in July we will be making a short documentary film that we will enter into film festivals. All backers will be given the opportunity to see this film exclusively before it reaches the public domain!Detroit is so well known for its demise, for its collapse and for its degradation and ruins but my photographs will be showing the inspiration, positivity and true grit soul of Detroit and will include the production of a gallery exhibition of photographs, a photo book, aerial photography and a lasting collaborative relationship between the London and Detroit Art scene.WHY Detroit?I see many parallels between my recovery and the beauty in Detroit. People love to dwell in negativity-it seems to be the human condition. I was told I might not walk again, I didn't believe it and here I am. Yes I was broken but now I am living my life albeit in a new way but life is AMAZING! And Detroit is home to a hub of positive and strong people who love their city for good reason.I hope that my journey will inspire other people, especially survivors of TBI who are grappling with their own versions of a ""new normal.""After my injury I never really lost faith that I would continue to explore the world with my camera. I still connect to the world through a camera – I just have a different perspective, a perspective that proves positivity and hope can be found in any situation.Every day is therapy: Some days my hands shake too much to drive and photograph-on these days I edit. Some days editing takes me two or three times the amount of time it would have taken me before the injury-on these days I learn patience.I’ve worked extraordinarily hard since my accident to not only recover physically but to relearn how to live daily life as a single mum to my two children, I had to relearn how to do the shopping, how to cook a meal and how to plan food for a week. Me and my children a year and a half after the accident.


I’ve been a photographer since I was 18 years old.  I was a busy working photographer at the time of the accident - a business that I ran with my very small son River often in a sling on my back during shoots.



                  
(I was in this brace 24 hours a day for 4 months before I started rehabilitation.)

This link is great for some medical information about traumatic brain injury.
After the injury my initial focus was on walking again, then on being able to deal with every day life by myself. It sounds simple but even making phone calls or writing a shopping list was enough to cause my brain to shut down resulting in psychogenic seizures for the first few years. I can’t do everything that I could do before the injury but I have overcome obstacles that I never would have thought I would encounter in my life.
This link is a great introduction to the effects of a brain injury and could be a good place to start for anyone looking for more information or support. Headway.

              
I am fiercely passionate about my freedom to be creative and about my right to live my life with a huge amount of positivity. These two desires are the reason I am still a photographer, film maker and artist today. With your support I can follow my dream to document a Detroit that is fighting back to live again with hope and creativity and through this I can inspire other survivors of brain injuries. 
My work really only stopped for a year or two, since the injury I have been back to Paris to photograph for some photo stories on culture, London and Milton Keynes for some work with youth and I have most recently spent time in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where I have started a body of work that will be ongoing for a few years and focuses on juxtaposing the visual state of disrepair  (Rust.

 I've included a brief vocabulary section at the bottom!
I'm Rebekah Rosen, I'm a video game artist and recent college graduate. I've been making dolls for about a year now utilizing skills I learned in college (five years of 3D digital art experience as of 2015). 
Last year I went in search of a ball jointed doll (bjd) that was fat like me, and while I found hundreds of gorgeously sculpted dolls- they were all thin. I'm passionate about this project because I am not the only person out there seeking a doll with a bigger body type. I've received lots of positive reactions to my dolls and have at least 10 people that are serious about ordering one. I personally want this doll to shell one of my own characters who I've had since the mid 2000s!


Mature Face on BeechKiss Body!

Baby Face on BeechKiss Body!

   What We Need & What You Get  Funding pays for:



Early prototypes (approximately $200 worth of 3D sls prints)
Full size MSD prototype (approx. $650 worth of 3D sls prints)
Casting estimate (approx. $2250 worth of resin casting fees) for 20 dolls [If goal is not met, I will downsize to an order of 10 dolls]

Shipping of prototype from the US to Korea for casting (unknown cost right now) by Haru


 There are no other companies producing fat/plus size ball jointed dolls quite like mine. The few other plus size BJDs that exist are mostly YoSDs or tinies, or one of a kind (OoAK) original artist dolls (OADs). 
Most ball jointed dolls (bjds) are slim/thin, my dolls represent a breadth of bigger body types of which BeechKiss is the first, showing off an ""apple"" shape. This will be the first of my collectible resin bjds on the market and this is the first launch of being able to pre-order one of these dolls. 

There is also an option to get original artwork by me, which is customized for the individual of one of their own characters or dolls! And a desk figurine! And Jewelry!

Stainless Steel Butterfly Key necklace


If I don't reach my goal I will still be getting the order of dolls, I just may need to down size how many dolls I order at first or will just find a way to pay the difference myself.

Doll Package comes with:



1 set of 14mm eyes + eye putty (random color)
1 original oakbottom doll bag
1 original oakbottom pillow
1 face protector
1 Birth Certificate of Authenticity
1 beginner doll care tips page
1 handwritten thankyou note
1 blank light skin (""normal"" color) OR light tan color OR dark tan color OakBottom BeechKiss doll


The Impact   
You'll get a doll that looks like you or one of your characters or maybe can make a new character around the doll! 
Having dolls that show positive representations of bigger bodied people can help break down prejudicial barriers and help build the confidence of fat people that we are beautiful and natural.
    Risks & Challenges
Overall BJDs are a hobby of waiting for customizable dolls, I am expecting a much faster turn around then is commonly had in the doll community so I expect many of you will be satisfied regardless of small delays.

It's possible the original prototype could be damaged in shipping to Korea, and may delay the process of getting her cast- but never fear, I can print replacement parts and go through the sanding, priming, and modifying stage again if needed.
It's possible the casting company may need to do some extreme modifications to get BeechKiss to be cast-able. This would also act as a small delay to production.    Other Ways You Can Help



Get the word out and make some noise about OakBottom Dolls if you like what I do. 


Send me a message if you have any questions about my first doll or later dolls. 


If there's a doll you'd like to see that isn't out there- contact me and I can maybe make it for you (and 9 of your acquaintances)!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $4700 to help cover the costs of the production of 
  a nice show. This covers things like tents, police security, barricades and 
  signage, electricity, insurance and other infrastructure (all the boring stuff 
  that makes these events happen). Any additional money will go for more live 
  performances, as well as enhancements to the infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a <strong>thank you</strong> to our donors, we have enlisted the talented 
  <a href=""http://aquarelasabol.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Aquarela Sabol</strong></a> to create 
  a special piece of art for the event. From her work, we are making some exclusive 
  merchandise just for our donors, including stickers, posters, t-shirts and even 
  signed, limited edition prints. This will be the ONLY place you will be able 
  to get this exclusive merchandise, it will not be for sale at the event or anytime 
  afterwards. We are also offering special thank you posts on our websites and 
  social media. In addition, we have artist booth spaces and larger sponsorship 
  packages available, up to and including having the event named after you!</p>
<h3><strong>Artists</strong></h3>
<p>If you would like to exhibit at the show, please choose the $100 ""<strong>Artists 
  Booth</strong>"" option. This is ONLY available to artists located in South 
  Florida. We encourage you to split the booth with one or more artists. Each 
  booth space is 10x10 and comes with a pavilion tent and electricity. You will 
  need to bring all your own display materials, easels, tables, chairs, lights, 
  etc. All products sold in artist booths must be made from original work by the 
  artists, but may include prints, t-shirts and other merchandise. See this link for the <a href=""http://lifeisartfest.org/life-is-art-official-call-for-artists-for-dwntwn-arts-fair-deadline-august-17-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fine print</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Sponsors</strong></h3>
<p><strong>For details on all the benefits available to each sponsorship level, 
  <a href=""http://lifeisartfest.org/life-is-art-sponsor-opportunities-dwntwn-arts-fair/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">please click here</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are creating the Dwntwn Arts Fair in order to allow more artists and organization 
  participate in the big DWNTWN Art Days that is produced by the Downtown Development 
  Authority and includes dozens of arts organizations located around Downtown 
  Miami. By creating a pop-up street festival, we create a temporary space where 
  artists and organizations that may not be located in downtown can take advantage 
  of the massive media coverage surrounding the exciting weekend.</p>
<p>In addition, a family-friendly street festival engages the community in a special 
  way. By placing art in the public space, we create an opportunity for residents 
  to accidentally encounter culture and culture builds communities.</p>
<p>Life Is Art has over a six year track record of creating wonderfully engaging 
  events designed to bring the community together around local art. We have produced 
  well over one-hundred events of all shapes and sizes. For this show, we have 
  teamed up with some other exciting organizations who bring their own unique 
  experience to the programming.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> Of course, as any outdoor event in South Florida, we face weather challenges; 
    however, we have never let that stop us in the past. We have tents for all the artists 
    and programs. Should it get too bad, we can adjourn to the numerous restaurants 
    along the street with whom we are partnering.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We can definitely use some <a href=""http://lifeisartfest.org/volunteer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>volunteers</strong></a>, 
    especially to help set up Saturday morning and clean up Sunday night. Just 
    fill out <a href=""http://lifeisartfest.org/volunteer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>this 
    form</strong></a> and mention you want to help with Dwntwn Arts Fair!</p>
<p>Of course, we would love if you can help promote our fundraiser. Use those 
    Indiegogo share tools to let your friends know.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise $4700 to help cover the costs of the production of 
  a nice show. This covers things like tents, police security, barricades and 
  signage, electricity, insurance and other infrastructure (all the boring stuff 
  that makes these events happen). Any additional money will go for more live 
  performances, as well as enhancements to the infrastructure.
As a thank you to our donors, we have enlisted the talented 
  Aquarela Sabol to create 
  a special piece of art for the event. From her work, we are making some exclusive 
  merchandise just for our donors, including stickers, posters, t-shirts and even 
  signed, limited edition prints. This will be the ONLY place you will be able 
  to get this exclusive merchandise, it will not be for sale at the event or anytime 
  afterwards. We are also offering special thank you posts on our websites and 
  social media. In addition, we have artist booth spaces and larger sponsorship 
  packages available, up to and including having the event named after you!
Artists
If you would like to exhibit at the show, please choose the $100 ""Artists 
  Booth"" option. This is ONLY available to artists located in South 
  Florida. We encourage you to split the booth with one or more artists. Each 
  booth space is 10x10 and comes with a pavilion tent and electricity. You will 
  need to bring all your own display materials, easels, tables, chairs, lights, 
  etc. All products sold in artist booths must be made from original work by the 
  artists, but may include prints, t-shirts and other merchandise. See this link for the fine print.
Sponsors
For details on all the benefits available to each sponsorship level, 
  please click here.
The Impact
We are creating the Dwntwn Arts Fair in order to allow more artists and organization 
  participate in the big DWNTWN Art Days that is produced by the Downtown Development 
  Authority and includes dozens of arts organizations located around Downtown 
  Miami. By creating a pop-up street festival, we create a temporary space where 
  artists and organizations that may not be located in downtown can take advantage 
  of the massive media coverage surrounding the exciting weekend.
In addition, a family-friendly street festival engages the community in a special 
  way. By placing art in the public space, we create an opportunity for residents 
  to accidentally encounter culture and culture builds communities.
Life Is Art has over a six year track record of creating wonderfully engaging 
  events designed to bring the community together around local art. We have produced 
  well over one-hundred events of all shapes and sizes. For this show, we have 
  teamed up with some other exciting organizations who bring their own unique 
  experience to the programming.
Risks & Challenges
 Of course, as any outdoor event in South Florida, we face weather challenges; 
    however, we have never let that stop us in the past. We have tents for all the artists 
    and programs. Should it get too bad, we can adjourn to the numerous restaurants 
    along the street with whom we are partnering.
Other Ways You Can Help
We can definitely use some volunteers, 
    especially to help set up Saturday morning and clean up Sunday night. Just 
    fill out this 
    form and mention you want to help with Dwntwn Arts Fair!
Of course, we would love if you can help promote our fundraiser. Use those 
    Indiegogo share tools to let your friends know.

</div></div>","Reading ""Jitterbug Perfume"" catapulted a dream where I can now create art within a business context and make perfumes that help people feel good. 

The creative process is all about interpreting sounds, timbre, pitch, harmonies, melodies, tone and tempo into perfume. Wearing these perfumes is all about changing your perception of yourself and others. 
It's all for art, from the heart. 

What's the project?
This indiegogo campaign will help me purchase the supplies necessary for a new perfume that I have created. The concept is ready, the formula is ready, the artwork is ready. All the supplies just need to be ordered and put into production. 
The idea behind the perfume is sweet and genuine. It contains notes of ginger, turmeric, osmanthus, benzoin, castoreum and musk. It is meant to be worn by both men and women, letting the skin tell the rest of the story. I have been working on the perfume for a year and a half and have already tested it on many different skin types and colours. 
There are no parabens or additional chemicals added. It's raw materials, alcohol to dilute, straight to the bottle. 
Where will the funds go?Supplies include:

Raw Materials (wait till you smell this stuff.... sooo good)
Bottles 
Boxes 
Marketing (social media, photography) 

I would also like to better equip the lab so as to be able to produce larger batches. This requires the purchasing of:


Scales 
Beakers
Funnels
Filters

Overall, your contributions will help my business grow exponentially.

What's in it for you?

 All the perks to the right are all handmade. (sent out by December approx) -->
Each perfume has been created and thought out, hand poured, as well as labeled and boxed individually.

Why is this project worth supporting?
1. Let's face it, there aren't a lot of scent/olfactory related projects out there. 
2. Scent & Music...what?! Cool! Let's take things to the next level. Being conscious of our senses and how they work together helps us look at our world differently. Why aren't we focusing on poly sensory experiences more?
3.  The connection between scent & sound can be replicated and appreciated at concerts and at art exhibits.    (think of the extensions!)
4. Using our sense of smell more consciously, being aware of it's role in our day-to-day.
5. Your contribution will not only be helping create a new perfume, it will help set in motion more projects. Some of which include:

I am originally from Mexico and this opportunity would allow me to reconnect with my roots. With your help, I will be able to make my way down to Michoacan and participate in this residency which will help me evolve personally and professionally. This opportunity will help me fuel new work and help me focus on my concepts of Identity politics and its relationship to the Cosmos (spacetime, theory of relativity). </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/kindred-spirit-for-burning-man-2016/www.facebook.com/kindredspiritcar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kindred Spirit</a> will be 30-feet of audio-visual stimulation designed to 
spark conversation about the American Bison's complicated past, present,
 and future. Our art car will provide a lens through which we can explore 
the majestic mammal that's an intrinsic part of our collective history.</p>
<p>Our
 baby will be visually stunning, with a brown fur base meant to mimic 
the real animal by day, then glowing in a custom overlaid geometric 
color-changing LED pattern by night. Our furry sound-stage will host 
artist, live musician, and DJ performances throughout the week, and will
 feature an upper deck to dance, lounge, and catch great views of the 
Playa!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462765993/2016-04-14_09.05.31-1_bnd8ys.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Millions of bison once grazed the continent, serving as a major resource for the people who lived here for centuries.
 As ranching, farming, and mass hunting expanded in the 17-1800's, the 
bison's natural habitat became increasingly compromised. At the turn of 
the twentieth century and after decades of near-extermination, fewer 
than 1,000 bison remained alive. Through conservation and re-population 
efforts, there are now around 500,000 bison in North America, including 
some in Nevada. Very few of these animals, however, are cut from the 
same genetically-pure, free-ranging cloth of their ancestors. President Obama just signed a bill making the American Bison our official ""national mammal!"" <br/>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>How we're bringing Kindred Spirit to life...</h3>
<p>Our flatbed truck is being transformed into a two level mutant 
vehicle. The ground level will feature all of Kindred Spirit's inner 
workings, and the upper deck will be open to anyone and everyone to 
enjoy!
</p><p>Kindred Spirit's centerpiece will be an 11 feet high, 8 feet wide 
custom-designed steel bison's head, mounted to the front of our vehicle 
and visible from far away. Custom-built 3D panels will be mounted along 
the sides of the vehicle, creating the bison's shoulders, back, and 
hips. The panels will all be covered in different shades and lengths of 
brown fur to mimic those of a bison.
</p>
<p>The entire vehicle will be covered in a geometric lighting pattern. 
The head and each of the above-mentioned panels will have individually 
addressable LED light strips pre-installed, creating an endless number 
of visual pattern possibilities.
</p><p>The upper deck will be illuminated by a combination of par can lights, blacklights, and more LED strips.</p>
<p>We'll be bumpin' beats late into the night through our finely tuned 
sound system. It will be elevated between 3 and 11 feet off the ground, 
creating a top quality music experience for all desert dwellers. The 
upper deck will also feature its own sound set-up.
</p><p>Kindred Spirit is a collaboration between a bunch of different 
crews...we would absolutely love and appreciate your help to make it 
happen!</p>

<h3><b>Here's where your help will go...</b></h3>
<p>We have spent the last eight months conceptualizing, designing, and 
funding our creation. All of the pieces are in place to execute on every
 aspect, and your contributions are directly helping us cross the finish
 line and deliver our gift to the Playa...</p>
<p><b>Metalwork: </b>The major metalwork is happening at Metal Inc in 
Philadelphia. They've done awesome work for several other art cars on 
the Playa. For Kindred Spirit, they are building our storage room (where
 generators, subwoofers, cabling, etc will be housed), internal 
stairwell, upper deck, railings, DJ booth, and many other details. It's a
 massive undertaking, and we're grateful that Metal Inc is taking on a 
huge part of the project. 

</p><p><b>Bison head:</b> We've teamed up with Ian Liljeblad to construct 
our centerpiece, the Bison head that will cover the front of the 
vehicle. Ian is the man behind the famous reggae-inspired <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MovementofJahPeopleBM/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Movement of Jah People art car</a>. His metal fabrication work is fantastic, and we couldn't be happier to have him on board.</p>
<p><b>Lighting:</b> Our in-house design team is busy mapping our LED 
strips to fit the bison's head and body. They are also meticulously 
writing lines of computer code so we can melt as many faces as possible.
 We've figured out exactly how many strips + components we need, and 
your donations will help us unlock higher levels of visual stimulation. </p><p><b>Transportation:</b> It's gonna be quite the journey to get KS from 
New York City to Black Rock City.  The rear storage room will house all 
of our gear, eliminating the need for additional vehicles, but the 
cross-country trip won't be free!
<br/><br/>Everything you contribute will be distributed to these crucial elements of Kindred Spirit's existence!

<h2><b>Fun perks!</b></h2>
<p>Aside from limitless on-Playa debauchery, your contributions will get you some awesome perks:</p>

<p><i>Stainless Steel Bottles</i> - Stay hydrated on the Playa (and in the default world) with a custom-printed Kindred Spirit logo stainless steel water bottle!
</p><p><i>T-Shirts</i> - Show your Bison-inspired pride in a fresh Kindred

 the words ""Kindred Spirit"" printed between the shoulders.
</p><p><i>Hoodies</i> - Stay warm and fuzzy on the Playa or at home in our Kindred Spirit hoodie! It features our Bison head logo on the front.
</p><p><i>Pendants</i> - Look your absolute Playa freshest with our 
customized Kindred Spirit logo pendants. These are hand-crafted pieces 
that will look great on a chain or as a stand-alone pendant.

</h2>Burning Man 2016 is the first phase of a long-term plan for Kindred 
Spirit. We hope our time on the Playa this year will put smiles on your 
faces and that we'll watch the sunrise on our upper deck together while 
jamming to some deep-brain-stimulating music. We also hope our car will 
spark thought and conversation about our nation's complicated 
relationship with the bison. <br/>In the future, our goal is to become a 
stage for historians, environmentalists, conservationists, and other 
groups and organizations who are passionate about the bison and seek to 
spread knowledge and awareness. <br/>And of course... we'll be organizing
 music-focused get-togethers so we can dance together and make new 
memories outside of Black Rock City.<br/><h2></h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462778308/2016-04-14_09.05.33-3_aigimx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Kindred Spirit will be 30-feet of audio-visual stimulation designed to 
spark conversation about the American Bison's complicated past, present,
 and future. Our art car will provide a lens through which we can explore 
the majestic mammal that's an intrinsic part of our collective history.
Our
 baby will be visually stunning, with a brown fur base meant to mimic 
the real animal by day, then glowing in a custom overlaid geometric 
color-changing LED pattern by night. Our furry sound-stage will host 
artist, live musician, and DJ performances throughout the week, and will
 feature an upper deck to dance, lounge, and catch great views of the 
Playa!

Millions of bison once grazed the continent, serving as a major resource for the people who lived here for centuries.
 As ranching, farming, and mass hunting expanded in the 17-1800's, the 
bison's natural habitat became increasingly compromised. At the turn of 
the twentieth century and after decades of near-extermination, fewer 
than 1,000 bison remained alive. Through conservation and re-population 
efforts, there are now around 500,000 bison in North America, including 
some in Nevada. Very few of these animals, however, are cut from the 
same genetically-pure, free-ranging cloth of their ancestors. President Obama just signed a bill making the American Bison our official ""national mammal!"" 
  How we're bringing Kindred Spirit to life...
Our flatbed truck is being transformed into a two level mutant 
vehicle. The ground level will feature all of Kindred Spirit's inner 
workings, and the upper deck will be open to anyone and everyone to 
enjoy!
Kindred Spirit's centerpiece will be an 11 feet high, 8 feet wide 
custom-designed steel bison's head, mounted to the front of our vehicle 
and visible from far away. Custom-built 3D panels will be mounted along 
the sides of the vehicle, creating the bison's shoulders, back, and 
hips. The panels will all be covered in different shades and lengths of 
brown fur to mimic those of a bison.

The entire vehicle will be covered in a geometric lighting pattern. 
The head and each of the above-mentioned panels will have individually 
addressable LED light strips pre-installed, creating an endless number 
of visual pattern possibilities.
The upper deck will be illuminated by a combination of par can lights, blacklights, and more LED strips.
We'll be bumpin' beats late into the night through our finely tuned 
sound system. It will be elevated between 3 and 11 feet off the ground, 
creating a top quality music experience for all desert dwellers. The 
upper deck will also feature its own sound set-up.
Kindred Spirit is a collaboration between a bunch of different 
crews...we would absolutely love and appreciate your help to make it 
happen!



Here's where your help will go...
We have spent the last eight months conceptualizing, designing, and 
funding our creation. All of the pieces are in place to execute on every
 aspect, and your contributions are directly helping us cross the finish
 line and deliver our gift to the Playa...
Metalwork: The major metalwork is happening at Metal Inc in 
Philadelphia. They've done awesome work for several other art cars on 
the Playa. For Kindred Spirit, they are building our storage room (where
 generators, subwoofers, cabling, etc will be housed), internal 
stairwell, upper deck, railings, DJ booth, and many other details. It's a
 massive undertaking, and we're grateful that Metal Inc is taking on a 
huge part of the project. 

Bison head: We've teamed up with Ian Liljeblad to construct 
our centerpiece, the Bison head that will cover the front of the 
vehicle. Ian is the man behind the famous reggae-inspired Movement of Jah People art car. His metal fabrication work is fantastic, and we couldn't be happier to have him on board.
Lighting: Our in-house design team is busy mapping our LED 
strips to fit the bison's head and body. They are also meticulously 
writing lines of computer code so we can melt as many faces as possible.
 We've figured out exactly how many strips + components we need, and 
your donations will help us unlock higher levels of visual stimulation. Transportation: It's gonna be quite the journey to get KS from 
New York City to Black Rock City.  The rear storage room will house all 
of our gear, eliminating the need for additional vehicles, but the 
cross-country trip won't be free!
Everything you contribute will be distributed to these crucial elements of Kindred Spirit's existence!



Fun perks!
Aside from limitless on-Playa debauchery, your contributions will get you some awesome perks:
Stickers - Stylize with a Kindred Spirit sticker featuring our Bison head logo and Burning Man 2016 insignia. It looks good on anything!
Stainless Steel Bottles - Stay hydrated on the Playa (and in the default world) with a custom-printed Kindred Spirit logo stainless steel water bottle!
T-Shirts - Show your Bison-inspired pride in a fresh Kindred 
Spirit t-shirt. The front features our Bison head logo, and the back has
 the words ""Kindred Spirit"" printed between the shoulders.
Hoodies - Stay warm and fuzzy on the Playa or at home in our Kindred Spirit hoodie! It features our Bison head logo on the front.
Pendants - Look your absolute Playa freshest with our 
customized Kindred Spirit logo pendants. These are hand-crafted pieces 
that will look great on a chain or as a stand-alone pendant.

 




Kindred Spirit's Impact...
Burning Man 2016 is the first phase of a long-term plan for Kindred 
Spirit. We hope our time on the Playa this year will put smiles on your 
faces and that we'll watch the sunrise on our upper deck together while 
jamming to some deep-brain-stimulating music. We also hope our car will 
spark thought and conversation about our nation's complicated 
relationship with the bison. In the future, our goal is to become a 
stage for historians, environmentalists, conservationists, and other 
groups and organizations who are passionate about the bison and seek to 
spread knowledge and awareness. And of course... we'll be organizing
 music-focused get-togethers so we can dance together and make new 
memories outside of Black Rock City.
  The Kindred Spirit Team The Kindred Spirit team
 is a diverse bunch from the East Coast, with a healthy blend of Burning
 Man veterans and virgins filling the ranks. We're a crew of builders, 
artists, programmers, DJ's, musicians, entrepreneurs, and dreamers. 
Several of our folks have been members of art car crews in the past and 
have well-rounded knowledge of what it takes to build a project of this 
scale.
We all bring different skills, passions, and areas of expertise to 
the table, and we're all committed to seeing Kindred Spirit shine... 
 Other Ways You Can Help Kindred Spirit is our gift to the Burning Man community...
You
 can always help us by spreading the word about the car and sharing this
 campaign among your friends! For more information please check out our Facebook page, and follow us on Instagram!
Stay tuned for more updates from the Kindred Spirit crew as the Burn gets closer!
<3 THANK YOU AND SEE YOU IN THE DUST! <3

   I am a qualified Architectural and Decorative glass artist.  Since graduating in 2005 I have run my small business. Attending craft events and doing events such as country living show.   I love what I do and currently work with several different techniques to make one off pieces of glass art.

   I have recently moved to a larger studio space, which will allow me to expand and develop in new areas. Such as silk screen printing on glass and perhaps even another kiln to allow me to do more casting work.  making my own molds to cast glass into I would like to offer small group workshops. Working with them to make a small stained glass panels, during a weekend workshop  I will provide materials, tuition, lunch and refreshments.  

  However this will require some cash input in order for me to expand.  I will need to by safety equipment for pupils, extra sets of tools and soldering irons.  materials  and a light box. I currently have no heating, which I can handle and work through the cold.  But its west coast Scotland it is cold and wet.  I hope to put in some heating for my pupils but also to keep the studio damp free.
  A new medium size kiln and some modelling and mold making supplies.  Along with a small silk screen printing table, screens and possibly a UV exposure unit. 
Some fixtures and fittings to keep space safe and uncluttered.




How can you help?

 
Im hoping to raise £2000 to help me on my way.
£500 will be used for workshop tools and materials
£500 to set up silk creen printing 
£400 to help fit out studio with shelving and heating
£600 will go towards a new kiln and mould making equipment.  Along with any extra finance that I will create due to expanding in new avenues.
   Community impact-
  Living in Argyll, Scotland we are surrounded by beauty.  I would love to help people within the community use that inspiration to make there own little piece of glass art.  
I have worked with children before to design a stained glass window for our local hospital, which I went on to make and install.  It was a wonderful project and enjoyed by all. And still a much admired piece of community art.



So why help?


   Sometimes everyone needs a little help along the way.   I have been working in glass for 10 years now and I love what I do.  My head is full of ideas and new things to try.  But with day to day business overheads I struggle to get to that next stage to progress the business and ideas.

Even if you cant help financially then maybe help spread my cause. And help get me and A Touch of Glass Studio out there!!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Tania and I am on a mission to help the underprivileged women of Delhi by providing them with a sustainable and respectful income through my Clay Studio. I also want to reduce the use of fresh flowers which when disposed improperly can bleed fertilisers and waste into the land and create havoc with the groundwater. The clay flowers Tania Clay Studio makes are photo-real, customised, exquisite and forever! We invite you to be part of our journey.</p>
<p>The women in the studio were working as daily labourers and maids in Delhi and are from troubled backgrounds. But now they are proud staff in the studio. They have worked hard to learn the art of making beautiful, customised clay pieces. Each piece they create adds a special touch to the clients magic moments and helps them provide for their families. We welcome you to view them through the video and personally if ever you are in Delhi.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Some Product Examples</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The image shows the flower pots we have made. Each flower pot is a gift as part of a wedding.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572081168/vqqhu3xiolwlm3bly1fi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Studio has made a good start and I am proud of what we have achieved in the last 7 years. But we are barely scratching the surface. There is a lot more to do and we need funds for this. Funds from this campaign will be used for PR &amp; Marketing and to provide gainful employment for more underprivileged women.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need <strong>$2500</strong> per month to run a sustained SEO, Advertising and PR campaign to be able to advertise at the various trade fairs, magazines, events and retail outlets. Cost for 6 months is <strong>$15,000</strong> which is the minimum time required for the campaign to show results.</li>
<li>We would like to get each of our present employees certified by Deco Clay Japan. It will cost us <strong>$500</strong> per person to get them certified. We need <strong>$7500 </strong>to complete this.</li>
<li>Finally we need to increase the number of orders to be able to employ more women. We are looking to invest the remaining <strong>$13,500</strong> to employ at least 10 more women to take the total staff to <strong>25 women</strong> by end of this year.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Since this money will be going towards the expansion of the studio, I will be running a flexible campaign and whatever money I am able to raise will go towards uplifting more women and generating a positive buzz about the studio, its women, our mission and our beautiful products.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We are excited to offer you great perks which will go towards these goals. Take a look at the amazing perks we are offering and grab them as stocks last.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There are real world impacts of this campaign. Some of the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are an all women studio working towards empowering other women in Delhi, India.</li>
<li>Every woman we hire is from the slums of Delhi and working in difficult conditions as daily labourers or maids in the extreme weather. Their lives are immeasurably improved by your contributions which will allow us to train them and hire more of them.</li>
<li>Your contributions will allow us to get more orders, hire more women. These women in turn are able to work in safe, secure and comfortable conditions earning a reasonable wage which allows them to <strong>educate their children</strong> and live with their heads held high.</li>
<li>Tania Clay Studio has more than <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/taniasclaystudio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">90,000 likes and followers on Facebook</a>. </strong>This is a real business with loyal, engaged customers. Your contribution will help us to do more for them and you.</li>
<li>We work with NGOs like <a href=""https://protsahan.co.in/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Protsahan</a> in Delhi to ensure we create the maximum impact when we hire new staff.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Hi, I'm Tania and I am on a mission to help the underprivileged women of Delhi by providing them with a sustainable and respectful income through my Clay Studio. I also want to reduce the use of fresh flowers which when disposed improperly can bleed fertilisers and waste into the land and create havoc with the groundwater. The clay flowers Tania Clay Studio makes are photo-real, customised, exquisite and forever! We invite you to be part of our journey.
The women in the studio were working as daily labourers and maids in Delhi and are from troubled backgrounds. But now they are proud staff in the studio. They have worked hard to learn the art of making beautiful, customised clay pieces. Each piece they create adds a special touch to the clients magic moments and helps them provide for their families. We welcome you to view them through the video and personally if ever you are in Delhi.
 
Some Product Examples
 
The image shows the flower pots we have made. Each flower pot is a gift as part of a wedding.

An example of a wreath used for a wedding decoration.


Some marigolds for the festive season. Looks as real as it can be.. and no waste!

 
What We Need & What You Get
 
The Studio has made a good start and I am proud of what we have achieved in the last 7 years. But we are barely scratching the surface. There is a lot more to do and we need funds for this. Funds from this campaign will be used for PR & Marketing and to provide gainful employment for more underprivileged women.

We need $2500 per month to run a sustained SEO, Advertising and PR campaign to be able to advertise at the various trade fairs, magazines, events and retail outlets. Cost for 6 months is $15,000 which is the minimum time required for the campaign to show results.
We would like to get each of our present employees certified by Deco Clay Japan. It will cost us $500 per person to get them certified. We need $7500 to complete this.
Finally we need to increase the number of orders to be able to employ more women. We are looking to invest the remaining $13,500 to employ at least 10 more women to take the total staff to 25 women by end of this year.

 
Since this money will be going towards the expansion of the studio, I will be running a flexible campaign and whatever money I am able to raise will go towards uplifting more women and generating a positive buzz about the studio, its women, our mission and our beautiful products.
We are excited to offer you great perks which will go towards these goals. Take a look at the amazing perks we are offering and grab them as stocks last.

 
The Impact
 
There are real world impacts of this campaign. Some of the main ones are:

We are an all women studio working towards empowering other women in Delhi, India.
Every woman we hire is from the slums of Delhi and working in difficult conditions as daily labourers or maids in the extreme weather. Their lives are immeasurably improved by your contributions which will allow us to train them and hire more of them.
Your contributions will allow us to get more orders, hire more women. These women in turn are able to work in safe, secure and comfortable conditions earning a reasonable wage which allows them to educate their children and live with their heads held high.
Tania Clay Studio has more than 90,000 likes and followers on Facebook. This is a real business with loyal, engaged customers. Your contribution will help us to do more for them and you.
We work with NGOs like Protsahan in Delhi to ensure we create the maximum impact when we hire new staff.
We would like to get the word out to reduce the use of fresh flowers. Waste from the improper disposal of fresh flowers is an issue worldwide and causes damage to the groundwater as chemicals and fertilisers leech into the water.

 
We welcome visits to our studio and are happy to link you with our staff to let you get a firsthand feel of the impact of your contribution.

 
Risks & Challenges
 
There are always risks in every campaign. But as you are funding a business that has been running for 7 years already, they are relatively low in this case. Some of them would be:

Regulation changes which make it difficult to import Japanese clay into India. This could be mitigated by shipping them through our Singapore offices.
We partner with rural artisans in Indian villages for our boxes and packaging. These might be stretched as we expand. We will have to diversify our sources of these materials.
Prices are rising and the Indian economy is witnessing a slowdown. Hence we are looking at such campaigns to expand globally and diversify our client base.
Tania Clay Studio has always had a controlled, yet strong growth. However, we need to market aggressively in the future without which we see our growth plateauing. Thus the need for funds so we can grow and create a larger impact in the world.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Thanks for taking a look at this crowdfunding campaign! I am Daniel Amaya a circus &amp; tech artist originally from Bogotá, Colombia. </p>
<p>I am willing to become a professional circus artist and take my skills to the next level. That is why I am joining the Centre Régional des Arts du Cirque Piste d’Azur, a circus school in the south of France, at the end of September 2019. </p>
<p>The hardest part is done! After an intense three days audition, I have got selected out of among one hundred participants together with 6 other skillful acrobats, aerialists and jugglers to receive a 2 years training in ‘Circus and Movement artist’ degree. </p>
<p>I did my bet. I risked everything to be where I am right now. I quit the comfort of a predictable future, I quit my social status, I quitted the safe zone and I quit the expectations of others over myself. Everything to follow this dream. Now I am asking you to join this bet and help me to reach the next goal. I am asking for donations to help cover the basic expenses for starting this trip. It is the visa and tuition fees and the transport expenses.</p>
<p>I would be super thankful if you help me to make this dream possible! Any money you donate will contribute directly to my development as a circus professional, and enable me to give more back to the circus community in Latin America, Europe and all around the world!</p>

<h3>My story</h3>
<p>There are some things in life that we don’t choose, but rather discover. That was my case with circus. Since always, I felt a genuine love for mathematics, which brought me to study Mechatronics Engineering at the National University of Colombia, a place where everything is possible as it is a crossroad for  scientists, artists, athletes, politicians, activists and even tourists. During my studies, I early discovered circus thanks to a group of young people that I used to see juggling and jumping around every single day, through my classroom window. It took me some time the let my curiosity lead me and go. ‘Could you teach my how to juggle?’ I asked them one day. That was the moment I truly discovered a passion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564614100/kgktm0qra76lbozigddg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>In the back, the Science &amp; Tech building where I used to take classes. In the front, me training with friends and failing a trick! </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>2013. Bogotá, Colombia.</i></p>
<p>Fast enough I became part of the unpredictable and fervent phenomenon of latin american street circus! In less than three years my circus hunger took me to visit half of Colombia and other four countries in South America! Of course... during the university’s vacations. For several years, I kept on studying engineering alongside circus on a separate empirical path until I found out that I could join them to create mind blowing universes and go where no one had gone before! At the end jugglers are ""practical mathematicians"" and that is exactly what I am looking for when I juggle: using the balls as brushes to paint every sort of ephemeral shapes in the air.</p>

</div></div>
<p>In 2018, I had the opportunity to join <a href=""http://www.hivers.fr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the HIVE</a>, a six month residency program in the south of France getting together 20 young creatives from all around the world in order to offer the set of conditions to let their imagination come true through a tangible project. I co-created the project Wearkit: interactive costumes for performing arts.</p>
<p>Take a look to this reportage that France 3 did about us (in french) at the very beginning of the residency: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBHVTjL8ANs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youtube.com/watch?v=vBHVTjL8ANs</a></p>
<p>This was a very challenging experience that questioned me in every sense, since the very professional layer until the most personal fibers. During the time our residency lasted, we had the opportunity to collaborate with other artists to create two interactive performances while trying to take a glimpse at the future of performing arts. It was like swimming into the darkness. We didn’t know where we were going, but I was really enjoying this new creation way. I was feeling glad of living this new version of myself that was not looking for the good answers but rather for the good questions. Nowadays, I think it was a really growing experience for my artistic being.</p>
<p>You can take a look to our creations during the residency here:<br/>CTRL: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/282113627"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vimeo.com/282113627</a><br/>Intome: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/267872243"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vimeo.com/267872243</a></p>
<p>This was the inflexion point. During the development of Wearkit, I have understood what I really wanted to work for: looking for the encounter of the three key points of my life: my body, math, and technology all around the circus language. </p>
<p>I was only missing one thing: reaching the high level set of skills to clearly settle my departure point as a professional circus artist. So, I decided to join a circus school where I could receive training and get the set of tools to start my professional creation path. That is why you are reading this right now!<br/> </p>

<h3>About the school</h3>
<p>At the core of the Côte d’Azur region, the Centre Régional des Arts du Cirque PACA - Piste d’azur stands as high level contemporary circus preparatory and professional school. It is a member of the European Federation of Professional Circus Schools (FEDEC). It is also part of the ProCirK network together with the circus schools Arc en Cirque, in Chambéry, and Balthazar, in Montpellier; schools which issues a Level III “Circus and Movement Artist” qualification registered with the French National Register of Professional Certifications.</p>
<p>It is the place where I will try many ideas, and fail, and try again, and fail again, and eventually find something amazing, and then I will research again, and find something even more impressive and at some point I will find something really mind blowing, and beautiful, and clever and poetic at the same time and then I will say ‘Yeah!’.</p>
<p>The audition was a super intense experience! I was the very first one arriving to the school that day as I passed the night in my tent on the beach under a huge shiny full moon, which was a beautiful moment, until the seagulls woke me up at 5 am. We performed a super intense physical test for the first filter and at the next day we were less than half of the initial group. Then we were tested in acrobatics, dance, theatre, music, creative writing and of course in our disciplines. That was how I got to met the school from inside: the atmosphere, the tent, the nature around it, the students, the teachers and my future partners! I loved the idea of becoming part of it. Even though I didn’t really love the idea of living in Cannes (I prefer cities like Marseille or Medellín). I actually feel that the school is one of those few things that make the city worth it to visit. It is one of those kind of things that you don't find anywhere else.</p>
<p>I am so excited and thankful of being chosen out together with Thaïs, Juan Pablo, Lucie, Angela, Grégoire and Marie-Ange with whom I will share this two years adventure! I am looking forward to start this new path with you guys!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>I am asking for donations to help cover the basic expenses for starting this trip. It is the visa and tuition fees and the transport expenses.</p>
<p>As a colombian citizen I have to start a student visa demand process directly in Bogotá which implies several administrative expenses. As this procedure has to be done in Bogotá, I need also to cover my round trip France - Colombia. Finally I have to cover the tuition fees and a bunch of bureaucratic expenses (if you live in France you might know what I mean).</p>
<p>For the last year I have been working hard to get savings to cover a year full-time studying. I have been performing, giving workshops and doing other random jobs like translations, event logistics and even offering personalized math classes! However it is not enough. The <a href=""https://co.ambafrance.org/estudiante"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">french embassy</a> estimates that living expenses (location, food, transportation, etc) for students over one year are not less than 7380 euros (615 euros per month). But this campaign is focus specifically on the departure expenses. </p>
<p>That is why I am extremely grateful for any donation or support you can provide to this goal, and I accept all the responsibility that comes along with your generosity investing the resources collected in this campaign exclusively on my circus development.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>I have created a series of rewards that express pretty well who I am and what my artistic project is about. I hope they will mean something to you and you can keep a nice souvenir, from a piece of artwork to a set of juggling knowledge or even an immersive circus short film!</p>
<p>I do a small parenthesis about the poster ‘Mi circo, pixel por pixel’ because I think you will enjoy it more when you understand what is going on here and also because I think it is super cool! So, to built this poster, I wrote an algorithm that takes the average pixel of every single photo of myself juggling since 2012 until today. Then I took a photo of Eureka, the act I performed during the school audition and I replace my costume by all the pixels that resulted from the previous algorithm. No Photoshop, only code lines! You see that little yellow spot? that was a juggling training day at the beach. Or you see the green one? It was a performance in a park of Bogotá.</p>
<p>In other words, this is my entire circus life resumed in one single image! Literally.</p>

<h3>Giving back</h3>
<p>Some of you might know about my engagement with circus as a tool for social change. A major axis of my artistic project is to keep on sharing my knowledge and spreading opportunities for others to be able to dedicate their lives to the arts. </p>
<p>I truly believe in the power of circus to change lives, and that is why I have worked hard together with the circus community since the very beginning. I started with the creation of festivals and meeting places in popular neighborhoods of Bogotá and Chía. Then I volunteered in many pedagogical processes using circus as the main tool in Dominican Republic, Haiti, Ecuador, Brazil and several isolated regions of Colombia from Tumaco until La Guajira. And most recently I volunteered at circus festivals and conventions like the French Juggling Convention and the European Juggling Convention. </p>
<p>I have always thought that this is a path that we build all together.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564614005/w0hgsvdlac7uevtzoxng.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The very first juggling workshop I offered to kids of my hometown. This was the departure of a series of events and workshops during several years in Chía and Bogotá.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>2013. Chía, Colombia.</i></p>
<p>The most recent pedagogical experience I had, was a one week intense workshop in Tumaco, Colombia. After 6 years of traveling while performing or teaching circus techniques, I felt I had seen almost everything. Nothing so far from the true. Working together with the Centro Afro to bring some circus to this guys was one of the most charging experiences I have ever had. Thank you guys.</p>

That is why I am extremely grateful for any donation or support you can provide to this goal, and I accept all the responsibility that comes along with your generosity investing the resources collected in this campaign exclusively on my circus development.
 
Rewards
I have created a series of rewards that express pretty well who I am and what my artistic project is about. I hope they will mean something to you and you can keep a nice souvenir, from a piece of artwork to a set of juggling knowledge or even an immersive circus short film!
I do a small parenthesis about the poster ‘Mi circo, pixel por pixel’ because I think you will enjoy it more when you understand what is going on here and also because I think it is super cool! So, to built this poster, I wrote an algorithm that takes the average pixel of every single photo of myself juggling since 2012 until today. Then I took a photo of Eureka, the act I performed during the school audition and I replace my costume by all the pixels that resulted from the previous algorithm. No Photoshop, only code lines! You see that little yellow spot? that was a juggling training day at the beach. Or you see the green one? It was a performance in a park of Bogotá.
In other words, this is my entire circus life resumed in one single image! Literally.

Giving back
Some of you might know about my engagement with circus as a tool for social change. A major axis of my artistic project is to keep on sharing my knowledge and spreading opportunities for others to be able to dedicate their lives to the arts. 
I truly believe in the power of circus to change lives, and that is why I have worked hard together with the circus community since the very beginning. I started with the creation of festivals and meeting places in popular neighborhoods of Bogotá and Chía. Then I volunteered in many pedagogical processes using circus as the main tool in Dominican Republic, Haiti, Ecuador, Brazil and several isolated regions of Colombia from Tumaco until La Guajira. And most recently I volunteered at circus festivals and conventions like the French Juggling Convention and the European Juggling Convention. 
I have always thought that this is a path that we build all together.

The very first juggling workshop I offered to kids of my hometown. This was the departure of a series of events and workshops during several years in Chía and Bogotá.
2013. Chía, Colombia.
The most recent pedagogical experience I had, was a one week intense workshop in Tumaco, Colombia. After 6 years of traveling while performing or teaching circus techniques, I felt I had seen almost everything. Nothing so far from the true. Working together with the Centro Afro to bring some circus to this guys was one of the most charging experiences I have ever had. Thank you guys.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Courtney Ehn. My performing name is Rainbow Flyte. I am the sole proprietor of Rainbow Flyte Aerial Arts. I am an aerial silks performer and aerial arts instructor. I’m hired to attend and perform at festivals, weddings, reunions, park parties, company picnics, social events, birthday parties, anywhere entertainment is needed. As an insured instructor, I teach people everywhere I go when my tripod rig and silks are set up. I also have aerial students who come to my home for their one on one private lessons. I’ve been doing aerial silks since 2013 as a student myself, then in 2016 decided to go to circus school, the New England Center for Circus Arts in Vermont to receive my aerial teacher training certifications in aerial silks, hammock, lyra/aerial hoop and trapeze. <i><strong>My absolute passion in life is to teach people magic they never thought they could experience.</strong></i> Circus was a huge part of american history, as time moves forward we have moved away from that imagination play. I think it is important for children and adults to still have an interactive imagination through circus arts. To expand their minds and experience it rather than just observe the superhuman, amazing hand eye coordination of circus performers.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where you come in...</h3>
<p>I would like to expand Rainbow Flyte Aerial Arts into not just performance and instruction, but to inspire movement, exercise and fun through object manipulation dance. I want people to get excited about moving their bodies. I believe it is important for everyone old and young to connect with their inner child and most healthy, happy selves. I want to be the person to show them how fun it is to learn new things especially between the brain and body. Though I need to increase my material list and have a larger option of activity for these workshops. Hence why I am here.</p>
<p>I’m asking the Indiegogo community to help Rainbow Flyte Aerial Arts share this experience. I wish to create a larger selection of objects to manipulate, dance toys and aerial equipment to encourage everyone to expand their idea of movement and dance. </p>
<p>Your donations will help me get all materials necessary to continue my dream inspiring and encouraging people to follow their dreams, learn about the history and future of circus arts, pay my  Rainbow Flyte Attendants (second hand and booth operator) and help with future travel expenses so I can spread the word and share dance play with people around the country. Like the creation of circus itself, I live to spark imagination in the minds of all who wonder how I make a living being myself, sharing my creativity, dreams and motivation with everyone anywhere I go.</p>
<p>Costs of Materials:</p>
<p>Custom Rainbow Silk: $300</p>
<p>Custom tie dye aerial hammock: $175</p>
<p>Custom children’s aerial hoop: $150</p>
<p>Aerial Rope: $200</p>
<p>Aerial Ladder: $100</p>
<p>Contact Staffs: $35 x 3= 105</p>
<p>Veil Fans: $10 each x 20 = 200</p>
<p>Poi balls: $2ea x 10 = 20</p>
<p>Veil poi: $10ea x 10= 100</p>
<p>Endo Board: $275</p>
<p>Weighted flags: $118/set</p>
<p>Dance wings: $10 x 10= 100</p>
<p>Travel Trailer for all equipment: $1000-2000</p>
<p>I will also purchase extra rigging materials, thicker protective mats for the ground, gymnastics rosin, Rainbow Flyte motivational t shirts and any other accessories I may need along with shipping all these awesome gifts out.</p>
<p>One day I  would like to open my own center for circus arts but for now I enjoy traveling and meeting  all the people from all areas of the united states.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Expanding Minds...</h3>
<p>I descend to invite those willing, to step up and learn firsthand what aerial silks is all about on the silks, a hammock or the lyra. Since aerial yoga is more common these days, I include instruction on how to use an aerial hammock for those who have or wish to have one at home. I enjoy sharing my talents with those brave enough to test their strengths or who just want to try new ways of exercise, dance or just to have a laugh.</p>
<p>But what about those people who don’t believe in themselves? The grounded ones. I meet so many people who shy away from attempting aerial arts because they don’t trust themselves. I want to cater to them as well. Strength and courage come in different varieties. I wish to be their encouragement for new experiences even if it isn’t off the ground. I want to open their minds to new things. So, I introduce my “circus toys” and teach those around me how to find their groove with whatever object in my toy box catches their eye. The goal is to expand, improve and experience their eye hand coordination, mind body connection, PATIENCE and artistic abilities, while controlling that object in order to create their own form of art.</p>
<p>Object manipulation is a form of mastery play or skilled performance in which a person or people physically interact with one or more objects. These skills are commonly recognized by CIRCUS, sports, magic and other everyday practices. Finding connections in one’s self builds confidence.</p>
<p>My small collection of objects I currently share with others are aerial silks, aerial hammock, aerial hoop, poi balls (LED color), contact staff, weighted flags, endo board, juggling balls, dance ribbon, veil poi, dance wings, veil fans, finger poi. I simply play and dance with these things so I can inspire others to try. AND THEY DO!  I love to teach, inspire and dance with men, women and children of all ages as a beginning to their own journey of obman dancercising (object manipulation dance exercising.)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and Challenges of my project are not meeting my goal by the time my campaign ends. This project is something I will never give up on so as long as I believe in myself and my dreams, I will overcome any obstacles. Circus is expensive so if my campaign doesn't work out, I will continue doing as I have done the last two years. Working to save and buy materials needed little by little. </p>
<p>As my touring season comes to an end, I will have four months of winter to raise money and grow my interactive circus before travels begin again in March. </p>

<h3>The Robert Henri Roadtrip and Residency</h3>
<p>When I came across signs for the <a href=""http://roberthenrimuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robert Henri Museum</a> driving with my wife on Highway 80 from Julesburg to Lincoln, I said ""We have to stop!"". When I learned they have a residency program I said ""I gotta apply!"". When I got word that I was selected for 2018 I immediately thought ""Lets make a documentary of this!""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532283235/enrhwxctabbtbnglwxck.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's going to be a whirlwind roadtrip painting the way from LA to Cozad in the first place. Then the residency itself: 21 days of all painting all teaching and getting people excited for paint, life, art and spreading the word about all things painting and plein air. We want to teach Nebraska to paint, and then teach the world. It will be the best Art School Painting Education they may ever get and dedicated in name and Spirit to it's native son Robert Henri.</p>
<h3>And We Wanna Film It!</h3>
<p>I want to be able to remember this and share it with more than just the people experienced on the journey, so I the need to fund another artist to join me, a filmmaker and documenter who I have worked with before, Luke Homay productions. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4uzv4piW3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first roadtrip documentary</a> we made years ago was amazing, and with all we've learned since then, this will be even better!  We are on a mission</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I think this is going to be a film-worthy journey and I need a professional to make a quality video of this once in a lifetime experience. I hope to have a positive impact on the people I meet in Nebraska, and I want everyone who watches the documentary to feel some of that too!</p>
<p>That's where Luke Homay comes in, the ideal travel partner. First off he is an excellent artist with gear and expertise in all aspects of film making. Secondly we are friends and have collaborated before on similar projects so we get along great. Third he is as excited about the documentary as I am for the residency so we are both GEARED UP!</p>
<p>Reality sets in pretty quick and you realize time is money which explains this fundraiser. There are some things that are covered by the program when we get to Cozad, but there are always expenses all the time and part of your donation will go toward costs of the road and ensuring we don't have to worry about anything but the residency and the film. Luke would like to get a few pieces of needed gear for his setup as well, such as drone camera, good sound and a variety of camera rigs. I need lots of tubes of color and art supplies and we all know they aren't cheap.</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","The Robert Henri Roadtrip and Residency
When I came across signs for the Robert Henri Museum driving with my wife on Highway 80 from Julesburg to Lincoln, I said ""We have to stop!"". When I learned they have a residency program I said ""I gotta apply!"". When I got word that I was selected for 2018 I immediately thought ""Lets make a documentary of this!""

It's going to be a whirlwind roadtrip painting the way from LA to Cozad in the first place. Then the residency itself: 21 days of all painting all teaching and getting people excited for paint, life, art and spreading the word about all things painting and plein air. We want to teach Nebraska to paint, and then teach the world. It will be the best Art School Painting Education they may ever get and dedicated in name and Spirit to it's native son Robert Henri.
And We Wanna Film It!
I want to be able to remember this and share it with more than just the people experienced on the journey, so I the need to fund another artist to join me, a filmmaker and documenter who I have worked with before, Luke Homay productions. The first roadtrip documentary we made years ago was amazing, and with all we've learned since then, this will be even better!  We are on a mission


What We Need & What You Get

<p>Our names are Selina and Justine Latour. We are twins originating from Ottawa, Ontario, now living in Montreal and Berlin respectively.  We’ve been accepted at the <a href=""https://buinho.pt/residency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buinho Creative Residency Program</a> in Messejana, Portugal, for the months of January and February 2019! This two month period is something we’ve been greatly looking forward to, as it will enable us the time towards developing our collaborative art practice after spending the last 6 years apart.</p>
<p>As identical twin sisters, we have grown up learning and absorbing each other’s ways of thinking. After studying separately in different fields (Selina in Fine Arts and Justine in Fashion Design), our ideas have continued to reflect one another’s, but our individual practices have expanded into different forms. With this residency opportunity, we are now looking forward to discovering ways to combine our skills to create works that are doubly strong.</p>
<p>In the last year, we worked from afar to start up a textile collaboration. Through this work, we spoke to our experiences of twinhood - intuitively working together to form images about femininity, togetherness and intimacy. We began to make clothing that combined Selina’s illustrations and textile designs with Justine’s pattern drafting and sewing skills. We named our collaboration <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/burnt.design/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burnt Design</a>, and we organized a couple of pop up shops in Toronto to begin funding this residency.</p>
<p>We are excited about this opportunity at Buinho, not only to continue our work in textiles, but also to finally share the time and space together to nurture a collaborative multidisciplinary practice. The Buinho Creative Residency Program offers a <a href=""https://buinho.pt/fablab/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fab Lab</a> facility, giving us access to innovative technologies (laser cutter, 3D printer, Arduino boards) that can help us to develop our mutual interests in creating installation and performance work.</p>
<p>Your help in funding this residency will help us to cover material costs in the projects we envision making, some basic living costs (food, lodging) as well as the travel costs to get us there. Any little bit helps - whether it’s a few dollars here or there to cover a grocery bill, pay for the bus from Lisbon to Messejana, or fund our analog photography expenses. Primarily, your financial support will allow us to achieve our creative projects!</p>
<p>We have a few perks to offer to express gratitude for your support: a small print (photo/watercolour or the like) for $15.00, a publication we intend to make from our photography in Messejana for $35.00, a Burnt hat design for $40.00, and/or a mystery piece for $55.00.</p>
<p>We are so excited to arrive in Messejana to begin expanding on this collaboration!  We look forward to making work and sharing it all with you!</p>

<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p><i>How does someone become who they are (and who they think they are)</i><i>?</i><br/><br/>My current project is a large-scale (7ft x 24ft), multi-layered tapestry piece that involves audio interviews as a ""soundtrack"" to the piece. The project seeks to question how growth occurs while a person is affected by environments, decisions, circumstances, and the intersection between self and others. Using ecological/botanical metaphor for human growth in a social environment, it will take the form of an embroidered/painted/collaged image of a forest to create an anthropomorphic character. Due to the variety of concepts that find their meeting point in the piece, I have been conducting different forms of research in artist residencies this year. I began with botanical/environmental research at Manassas National Battlefield Park, in addition to studying the primary source letters of Confederate soldiers written during the first battles of the Civil War. I then conducted personal one-on-one interviews during my residency at the Sheen Center For Thought &amp; Culture in Manhattan. During these sessions, I sat down with the interviewees and asked questions pertaining to their personal experiences and self-identity while sketching their portrait. Audio segments from these interviews will be played from behind the tapestry during exhibitions and remain completely anonymous. Interview participants came from a NYC area open-call I created, as well as alumni from Rehabilitation Through The Arts, and Year Up New York (an organization that works to close the opportunity divide for young adults from underprivileged backgrounds). As a form of gratitude for participating, each interviewee received a portrait lithograph print created from the sketches made during their session. Prints from these editions are also available as a perk for contributions on Indiegogo.<br/><br/>At each venue that the piece is exhibited in, a recording booth will allow visitors (two at a time) to sit and ask one another one of the interview questions. The booth will be a simple wood structure fitted with an iPad that will use an app to randomly select one of the questions used in the interviews and then record the response. Their recorded responses will be incorporated into the tapestry's audio at the next exhibition venue. <strong>The show will be on view in the Sheen Center gallery (18 Bleecker st, New York, NY, 10012) from September 13-October 12th, with an opening reception on September 13th (6-8 pm).</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong><br/><br/>I'm a NYC-based artist and educator originally hailing from Port Chester, NY. Through variety of texture and use of extensive layering, my work investigates the intersection between the specificity of our world—of a face—and the depth of the unknowable in reality. My pieces take form in tapestry, sculpture, painting, and installation—sometimes involving audio components. Isolation, aging, vulnerability, and the ways in which all of these factors affect our ability to know one another serve as just a few themes in my work. In an effort to understand what it means to honestly be ""moved,"" many of my pieces address viewers individually, sometimes imposing themselves or calling to viewers in a way that physically establishes an almost private relationship between the piece and its visitor.<br/><br/>I received a Bachelor of Science in Visual Arts from SUNY Purchase School of Art + Design. I've exhibited in various New York venues and have been awarded Artist-in-Residence positions at the Sheen Center For Thought &amp; Culture in Manhattan, NY and Manassas National Battlefield Park in Manassas, VA. My works can be found in the National Parks Foundation’s public collection and in private collections within the United States and Europe. I have most recently joined the governing body of Openings Artist Collective. I am currently an Art Educator with the New-York Historical Society, providing Art programs to students throughout NYC. I have previously taught Art in Brooklyn PreK-8 private schools, worked as a Teaching Artist for the NARS Foundation, and will be teaching High School art in the Fall. I have also assisted in art forensic and conservation projects for collections at the Hispanic Society of America Museum, PepsiCo Sculpture Garden, and TONDO Art Forensics Lab in Budapest, Hungary.</p>

<h3><strong>Funds Will Be Used For:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Equipment necessary for projecting the fragments of the interview audio. The individual voices will be on individual tracks in the audio file, and will be output to individual speakers placed in various locations in between the layers of the tapestry, creating another sense of depth in the piece. To achieve this, a laptop will need to feed the audio into two audio interface boxes that will control the output to each of the 15+ miniature speakers. This equipment constitutes the majority of the funding needs for this project. </li>
<li>Materials for building the physical tapestry piece, including large-scale fabrics, thread stock, wood, epoxy, paints, hanging equipment, etc...</li>
<li>Materials for constructing the recording booth and purchasing iPad for booth.</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, there are some cool perks, including private tours of the exhibition in NYC in September and wood lithography prints from those created during the ""Who Are You?"" interviews! Some of the prints can be found at the <a href=""https://www.saatchiart.com/art-collection/Printmaking/Who-Are-You-Interview-Prints/1101409/243030/view"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saatchi Art Page</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project seeks to allow the voice of those traditionally excluded by the ""jargon"" of the Art world to narrate and inform my work directly. The oral history volunteered by participants in this project will be engaged with in communities outside their own as the piece travels to various exhibition locations. Those who have already served as interviewees have communicated their surprise and gratitude for the experience of discussing the specific questions asked about themselves and their experiences. I hope the tapestry piece and recording booth can encourage such conversations to happen within everyday relationships, and not only exist in social art projects. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>It's a tight time frame that I have to finish the piece before its exhibition in September, but production is on schedule, and with your help I'll be able to spend less time finding thrifty ""work-arounds"" and will instead be able to purchase the right materials and devices to ensure the project can do what it is meant to do.</p>
