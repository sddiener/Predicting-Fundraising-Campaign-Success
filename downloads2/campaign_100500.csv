Joel Simpson, about to take a ‘round-the-world trip with a fabulous companion,
writer, professor, environmental NGO director Dr. Barbara Brodman, focusing
mainly on Asia. We’re both adventuresome travelers, with lots of experience
under our belts. I’ve lived in four European countries, speak French, Italian
and German, and she speaks Spanish and Portuguese. My Ph. D. is in comparative
literature, but I also have a masters in music, and I’ve done travel writing,
and music and art reviewing. I’m no stranger to large-scale projects. I
produced the <i>Dick Hyman Century of Jazz Pinao </i>CD-ROM in 1999, which sold world-wide; and <i>Sun Pictures to
Mega-Pixels, </i>a exhibition of archaic
process and digital process photography in 2007, that involved 125 artists. </p>
<p>I’ve been a serious photographer since I was 13, a
professional for the past 12 years, with publications and shows of my work in
the US, France, Australia, and Spain. Barbara and I have planned this trip to
visit some lesser known destinations as well as some better-known ones. We want to
show that it can be done at our age (she’s 70, I’m 67), and that you can go by
yourself, without a group, picking your own destinations, balancing serendipity
with planning, and keeping the freedom to  explore with maximum contact
with local people. </p>
<p>  With
both my wonderful Canon 5D Mark III full-frame digital SLR and the Noblex
Panoramic (film) camera, I’ll be photographing spectacular geology and
landscapes, flora and fauna, and above all the people we encounter:
“environmental” portraits (in the context of their lives), where they live,
shop, and conduct their spiritual and recreational lives. Plus, I’ll be
interviewing many of them with the 5D Mark III and an external microphone,
asking about the changes they’ve seen in their lifetimes, the problems they
foresee in climate change, agriculture, water management, the role of global
corporations, and how they view the Unite States. I’ve always made lots of
friends when I traveled, and we will certainly be good-will ambassadors for the
US, showing people that we thought it was worth it to visit them, and that
we’re interested in their problems and perspectives.</p>
<p>  In
70 days from March 31 to June 10, of this year we plan to visit the following:</p>

<p><span>  •JORDAN: Petra, Wadi Rum, Shobak and Karak Crusader castles<br/></span></p>
<p><span>  •KENYA: Nairobi
wildlife park and city</span></p>
<p><span>  •MADAGASCAR: Isalo
and Ranomafana National Parks, plus the cities of Antsirabe and Fianarantsoa</span></p>
<p><span>  •INDIA: the Ghats of
Varanasi on the Ganges, the erotic temples of Khajuraho, and Panna wildlife
park</span></p>
<p><span>  •NEPAL Kathmandu,
villages, Himalayas, culture </span></p>
<p><span>  •TIBET: Llahsa, the

to produce a photography book of the best images, my own tribute to Richard
Halliburton’s 1938 <i>Book of Marvels</i> which
gave me the travel bug when I was a teenager: Marvels 2014. I’ll be keeping a

We have the full support of the manufacturer and fulfilment has already been planned.</p>

This is our fifth crowdfunding campaign in just over 2 years. The real challenge starts after the campaign ends and the funds are released. We know that with our experience we will be able to produce the bag and have it shipped to backers by April – 2019. We have the full support of the manufacturer and fulfilment has already been planned.
Even though we do not see any direct risks, there are always unforeseen circumstances that may present themselves during production and fulfilment. If this were to occur, we will always be 100% transparent with you and communicate this to you right away. Our goal is to get you an awesome, high-quality bag you are excited about, and we will do everything we possibly can to make that happen.",20.0,2,"9 Campaigns

<p>The idea of Owly Packs emerged during a trip in Australia. Truth is: we were broke and thus forced to sleep in parks while waiting for our seasonal job to begin. With nothing but our backpack, we had no protection from the weather and would always wake up soaked from morning dew. We hoped that our backpack could magically transform into a shelter. As magic apparently would not do it, WE did. Since then, the concept has evolved tremendously. We went from a transformable backpack to an horrible brown tent and finally, after dozens of rounds of prototypes, to these fantastic products we are so proud to present you today!</p>

<p><strong>CREATIVE PROCESS AND PRODUCTION</strong></p>

<p>Trails, roads, mountains and even slow rides with our kids. We spend more on our bikes than we do on our cars. When it comes to bikes, there's a solution for almost every rider and ride. Tyres range from the width of your finger, to the width of your face. Frames are all sorts of shapes and lightweight carbon lay-ups are not designed to be clamped. Securing you bike for the adventure is getting harder and harder. Over a year ago, we set ourselves a mission, to get our bike to the trailhead regardless of which bike we choose. We went back to first principles of design, back to the drawing board to search for a secure, fast and gentle solution. We wanted less hassle, more riding... <strong>and we did it!!</strong></p>
<p>Stefan &amp; Sean started this mission with a fantastic complement of skills and quickly enlisted/recruited some truly amazing people who have taken this project to another level. Collectively we have designed and implemented for Bentley, Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Buik, Holden, ARB, Nissan, Toyota, Vauxhall, Yarra Trams, NS Bikes and Antidote Bikes. In addition, we have delivered more than $1.1 billion dollars in capital and operational projects over the past decade for organisations such as Public Transport Victoria, Transdev, MTR, KD, Defence Materiel Organisation and Siemens.</p>

<p><strong>Sean</strong> is passionate about all things on two wheels. His obsession with bikes is matched only by his love of challenging assumptions. </p>
<p><strong>Stefan</strong> believes anything is possible with the right team, passion and mindset. His preoccupation with product perfection is never ending. </p>
<p><strong>Waldek</strong> is an aerospace engineer with a passion for cars and mountain biking. His engineering team of 30 people serve the likes of BMW, Audi and Volkswagen. His favourite saying is ""Impossible tasks right away. For miracles, you have to wait one day"". </p>
<p><strong>Igor</strong> is a bike-nut, off-roading enthusiast &amp; problem solver. He's most at home with an ultra-powerful laptop, 4WD and a mountaintop for an office. No technical problem, workshop or late-night CAD session scares him. </p>
<p><strong>Jurek</strong> is a mountain bike freak, designer and co-owner of Antidote Bikes. Designing and riding are the most important things in his life. </p>
<p><strong>Troy</strong> has 25 years in the bike industry and an extreme passion for anything off-road. Attention to detail, loyalty and accountability in life and work are his trademarks.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Can I fit more than 1 bike?</strong></p>
<p><i>Absolutely, you can fit 2-5 if you 'head to tail' them. How many depends on the width of your roof bars, width of your handlebars and if the roof bars extend out beyond the mounting brackets. So with road bikes (narrow handlebars) on a wide rack you could fit 6 (using the three cross rails like Sean's white Landcruiser in the GIF). On a small car with mountain bikes (wide handlebars) you may be limited to two.</i></p>
<p><strong>Does it lock?</strong></p>
<p><i>It does now.... we have worked really hard to create a solution we can be proud of. An electronic lock has been included in ALL versions of the rack. Check out the updates sections for some insider info on the lock mechanism and how it all happened.</i></p>
<p><strong>Is it a problem to have my suspension forks upside down?</strong> </p>
<p><i>Having your suspension forks upside down is actually a good thing. It keeps the internal components like the foam rings and wiper seals lubricated. This helps to cut down on static friction (stiction) in use. When oil seals and foam wipers dry out they drastically increase friction inside the fork. Depending on the lower leg bath oil levels and service intervals, just riding and compressing the fork may not provide the optimal lubrication for the seals. <br/>It is for this reason that some suspension manufacturers and professional riders recommend storing your bike upside down. <br/>You'll have no problem with leaks unless you have a seal failure already. Compressing the fork on uneven trail surfaces as you ride produces far more pressure on the seals than turning the bike upside down. Many forks (like the current most popular fork on the market) have no air inside the damping system. <br/>They use a closed system with a bladder to compensate for temperature and variations like some hydraulic brake systems. In this case the position of the system makes no difference to its function.</i></p>
<p><strong>Will turning my bike upside down get air in the my hydraulic brakes?</strong></p>
<p><i>Correctly bled and operational hydraulic brakes have NO air inside the system. Air is present only in the bladder behind a rubber membrane in the lever. It is designed so that air cannot escape the bladder and enter the system even if upside down. <br/>Its function is to compensate for variations in temperature since fluid slightly expands when its temperature increases. It also allows for the change in volume of the fluid system as brake pads wear. <br/>Before riding, brakes should always be tested whether the bike has been upside down or not. If your brakes are not fully operational, there is an issue in the system and the brakes should be serviced. <br/>Check out the following link for a great explanation of how a hydraulic brake system works:<br/><a href=""http://www.epicbleedsolutions.com/blog/how-hydraulic-brakes-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.epicbleedsolutions.com/blog/how-hydraulic-brakes-work/</a></i></p>
<p><strong>Won't spinning wheels wear out my bearings?</strong></p>
<p><i>Wheel bearing wear is generally a result of both cycles and load combined. The wear rate increases dramatically with load. There is a detailed equation in the link below calculating the life of the wheel bearing based on these inputs. But more simply put, the key things to know about spinning wheels in transport are as follows: <br/>- Doubling the load on the wheel bearing reduces the life to one tenth. Reducing the load by half increases the life by ten. <br/>- Doubling spin speed reduces wheel bearing life by one half. Reducing speed by one half doubles the life. <br/>- When the load reduces to zero, wheel bearing life extends to infinity.</i></p>
<p><i>Ok, we know a wheel doesn’t weigh zero. But compared to a bike and rider, the load and <br/>therefore wear on a wheel bearing while spinning in transport is negligible. <br/>We have carried out some initial test runs at 100km/hr and the wheel spin is negligible compared to wind force whilst the vehicle is stationary, there is some science saying the windforce on top an bottom of the wheel would prevent any crazy spin speeds. We are definitely going to test further and will offer a simple strap to secure it, if it proves to be an issue.</i></p>

<p><strong>Will it put too much stress on my seat-post / seat rails / handlebars / headstem?</strong></p>
<p><i>We deliberately take advantage of bicycle design (including carbon and alloy material characteristics) to provide a strong, secure and gentle grip of your bike.</i></p>
<p><i>The design of the rack ensures the load on the seat is up/down, which is the same as when ridden. There is no twisting load on the seat post as the handlebars take that load which is also the same as when riding. Clearly the weight of the bike is considerably less than the lightest rider, so if it is ok for the ride it will definitely be ok for the Upside Rack.</i></p>
<p><i>When it comes to testing for stresses and any vibration impacts, we are relentless. We have a grueling test plan to complete, testing for durability of the rack and protection of your bike.</i></p>
<p><strong>Will it effect my dropper post?</strong></p>
<p><i>The design of the rack ensures the load on the seat post is up/down, which is the same as when ridden. There is no twisting load on the seat post from the installed position, so any loads would be exactly what seat posts are designed to take in use. <br/>Regarding dropper posts, the load of the actual bike on the post will obviously be significantly less than a rider. <br/>We drop our posts before installation as well, but it's not necessary. We have tested on our dropper posts (Sean's is the Norco in the vids, Stefan's is the Stumpjumper) without any issues but have a plan in place to purchase the major models and test them further.</i></p>
<p><strong>Testing .... what is environmental testing, and why do it?</strong></p>
<p><i>The environment we live and ride in is harsh. Salts, ultraviolet light and other weathering impacts damage materials during their life. These impacts can be rapidly accelerated in laboratory conditions to understand lifelong impacts in normal use. <br/>The Upside Rack has been carefully designed using long-lasting and weather resistant materials such as anodized aluminium, which provide years of reliable use while maintaining the appearance you expect from a top-quality brand.</i></p>
<p><strong>Testing .... what is vibration and rough road exposure testing, and why do it?</strong></p>
<p><i>We come from the land of long, rough, harsh corrugated roads that seem to disappear over the horizon. So we know more than a little about durability and brutal, rugged roads in both professional and recreational capacities. <br/>So, when it came to producing the Upside Rack we combined our experience with the benefit of real world testing. The end result is an extensive test plan in place for the prototypes and first production units. This means that by the time you get your own Upside Rack, we will have tested it for more miles on rougher roads than you ever will.</i></p>
<p><strong>Static testing, what and why?</strong></p>
<p><i>Testing went well beyond seeing what it takes to 'rattle' the Upside Rack. We have analysed every joint, component and operation for any sharp edges, pinch points, squeaks and rattles to make sure you have nothing but an enjoyable experience getting to, and from your ride. That’s our goal. A rack that’s intuitive, unobtrusive and always reliable.</i></p>
<p><strong>The City crash test and other load tests.... what and why?</strong></p>
<p><i>Put simply, they ensure safety in the event you have to brake or swerve suddenly, to ensure the bike doesn't simply 'fly off the roof'. Our prototype has passed testing exceeding these conditions, testing will be replicated on the production unit to ensure certification is achieved before the first unit is sent out.</i></p>
<p><i><u>City Crash Test </u><br/>This is an international standard as part of ISO 11154 for roof load carriers on vehicles. It involves simulating a low-speed crash in which the rack with a bike installed is exposed to eight times its weight (commonly known as 8g). <br/>The rack passes this test if the bike remains fixed to the rack and car, and no part weighing more than 10 grams comes loose off the rack. This same standard applies to roof bars to ensure they don’t move under crash conditions so we recommend use of only ISO approved roof bars.</i></p>
<p><i><u>Other load tests </u><br/>Additional parts of ISO 11154 include pushing, pulling and lifting the bike as it is fixed to the rack and measuring any movement to ensure a secure fit. Forces of over 60kg are applied to simulate hard braking, braking while cornering, side wind load and aerodynamic lifting affects.</i></p>

Trails, roads, mountains and even slow rides with our kids. We spend more on our bikes than we do on our cars. When it comes to bikes, there's a solution for almost every rider and ride. Tyres range from the width of your finger, to the width of your face. Frames are all sorts of shapes and lightweight carbon lay-ups are not designed to be clamped. Securing you bike for the adventure is getting harder and harder. Over a year ago, we set ourselves a mission, to get our bike to the trailhead regardless of which bike we choose. We went back to first principles of design, back to the drawing board to search for a secure, fast and gentle solution. We wanted less hassle, more riding... and we did it!!
Stefan & Sean started this mission with a fantastic complement of skills and quickly enlisted/recruited some truly amazing people who have taken this project to another level. Collectively we have designed and implemented for Bentley, Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Buik, Holden, ARB, Nissan, Toyota, Vauxhall, Yarra Trams, NS Bikes and Antidote Bikes. In addition, we have delivered more than $1.1 billion dollars in capital and operational projects over the past decade for organisations such as Public Transport Victoria, Transdev, MTR, KD, Defence Materiel Organisation and Siemens.

Sean is passionate about all things on two wheels. His obsession with bikes is matched only by his love of challenging assumptions. 
Stefan believes anything is possible with the right team, passion and mindset. His preoccupation with product perfection is never ending. 
Waldek is an aerospace engineer with a passion for cars and mountain biking. His engineering team of 30 people serve the likes of BMW, Audi and Volkswagen. His favourite saying is ""Impossible tasks right away. For miracles, you have to wait one day"". 
Igor is a bike-nut, off-roading enthusiast & problem solver. He's most at home with an ultra-powerful laptop, 4WD and a mountaintop for an office. No technical problem, workshop or late-night CAD session scares him. 
Jurek is a mountain bike freak, designer and co-owner of Antidote Bikes. Designing and riding are the most important things in his life. 
Troy has 25 years in the bike industry and an extreme passion for anything off-road. Attention to detail, loyalty and accountability in life and work are his trademarks.

A massive thank-you to the awesome people that helped us along this journey, answering a thousand questions and always with a smile.

FAQs
Can I fit more than 1 bike?
Absolutely, you can fit 2-5 if you 'head to tail' them. How many depends on the width of your roof bars, width of your handlebars and if the roof bars extend out beyond the mounting brackets. So with road bikes (narrow handlebars) on a wide rack you could fit 6 (using the three cross rails like Sean's white Landcruiser in the GIF). On a small car with mountain bikes (wide handlebars) you may be limited to two.
Does it lock?
It does now.... we have worked really hard to create a solution we can be proud of. An electronic lock has been included in ALL versions of the rack. Check out the updates sections for some insider info on the lock mechanism and how it all happened.
Is it a problem to have my suspension forks upside down? 
Having your suspension forks upside down is actually a good thing. It keeps the internal components like the foam rings and wiper seals lubricated. This helps to cut down on static friction (stiction) in use. When oil seals and foam wipers dry out they drastically increase friction inside the fork. Depending on the lower leg bath oil levels and service intervals, just riding and compressing the fork may not provide the optimal lubrication for the seals. It is for this reason that some suspension manufacturers and professional riders recommend storing your bike upside down. You'll have no problem with leaks unless you have a seal failure already. Compressing the fork on uneven trail surfaces as you ride produces far more pressure on the seals than turning the bike upside down. Many forks (like the current most popular fork on the market) have no air inside the damping system. They use a closed system with a bladder to compensate for temperature and variations like some hydraulic brake systems. In this case the position of the system makes no difference to its function.
Will turning my bike upside down get air in the my hydraulic brakes?
Correctly bled and operational hydraulic brakes have NO air inside the system. Air is present only in the bladder behind a rubber membrane in the lever. It is designed so that air cannot escape the bladder and enter the system even if upside down. Its function is to compensate for variations in temperature since fluid slightly expands when its temperature increases. It also allows for the change in volume of the fluid system as brake pads wear. Before riding, brakes should always be tested whether the bike has been upside down or not. If your brakes are not fully operational, there is an issue in the system and the brakes should be serviced. Check out the following link for a great explanation of how a hydraulic brake system works:http://www.epicbleedsolutions.com/blog/how-hydraulic-brakes-work/

Reducing speed by one half doubles the life. - When the load reduces to zero, wheel bearing life extends to infinity.
Ok, we know a wheel doesn’t weigh zero. But compared to a bike and rider, the load and therefore wear on a wheel bearing while spinning in transport is negligible. We have carried out some initial test runs at 100km/hr and the wheel spin is negligible compared to wind force whilst the vehicle is stationary, there is some science saying the windforce on top an bottom of the wheel would prevent any crazy spin speeds. We are definitely going to test further and will offer a simple strap to secure it, if it proves to be an issue.

<p>It was June 9, 2007 that Rob and I finally said I do in front of family and friends. We've been together happily since 2001, so we recently celebrated 15 years of our relationship (which is quite the feat nowadays in and of itself). <br/>FUN FACT:  The song playing in the video just happens to be appropriate..  it was the song that played at our wedding in Vegas. </p>
<p><br/>It was only recently that we realized... wait, we never had a honeymoon! When we first got hitched in 2006, it was in front of the clerk of the court, then we went back to our household duties immediately after. When we finally had our  ACTUAL wedding in 2007, it was in Vegas, but the day after the nuptials? We returned home and resumed our usual life (work and responsibility called). We never really thought much about it. </p>
<p><br/>As most of you know, we have raised some amazing kids. And while we've made attempts to save up for a trip for just ourselves, well, as John Lennon once said, ""Life is what happens when you get busy making other plans.""<br/>We've accepted this pearl of wisdom. Just when we think we have enough, something happens with one (or a couple) of the kids (of course they always come first). We stopped traveling for conventions (most of which the kids come with us, and let's face it, those aren't vacations), so we'd have more money to do things. Then emergency home repairs swooped in. Then my health began to decline, so yay medical bills. This isn't a sob story, it's just life. We've accepted that's how things are, and we accept it as is. Adulting always comes first, and that's just fine.</p>
<p>Most of you know just how hard we both work to provide our family with a more comfortable childhood and adolescence than we had, and personally?  I have watched Rob sacrifice a number of things to make sure that happens. And, as most of you know, Rob is far more supermegaresponsible than one man should ever  be. He's much more of the ""adult"" than I am in that fashion. I want to do this for him, especially. </p>
<p>There have been a number of factors recently that made us stop and think, ""You know, MAYBE,  just maybe, after 16 years, we'd get our first trip alone together, just to focus on us, and live a little... wouldn't that be cool?"" </p>
<p><br/>So,  what the hell... life is short, so we're giving it a shot. With the research help of some close friends (and my wonderful oldest daughter), we're budgeting a trip to my motherland.

Here are some downsides you should be aware of before you buy Snowfeet:</p><ul><li><strong><span>Do all ski resorts allow the use of Snowfeet on their slopes?</span></strong></li></ul><p>Snowfeet are a new winter sport and you might come across people who are skeptical of them. That might also happen in a ski resort. However, the base of Snowfeet is made of the exact same metal ski edges as all the other skis. Our experience is that if you act as if you were skiing with your traditional skis, no one will bother you. And if that happens anyway, argue that Snowfeet are safe and contain metal ski edges, which is the most common requirement of ski resorts. Most importantly don't forget to stay positive and friendly, which helps the most.</p><ul><li><strong><span>Is it hard to learn?</span></strong></li></ul><p>Learning to use Snowfeet is as hard as learning to ski. So it takes some time and you will definitely fall now and then, but that’s part of the fun? Don't forget that learning is effortless if you enjoy the ride. </p><ul><li><strong><span>Can I use them in powder?</span></strong></li></ul><p>You can use Snowfeet on snow that is not deeper than +/- 20 cm. Snowfeet are best on ski slopes, snow parks, forest paths and off the slopes too, just not in deep powder. Of course, Snowfeet are best on a groomed snow.</p><ul><li><strong><span>Can I use them on very steep slopes?</span></strong></li></ul><p>Because of their size and weight, it might not be as easy to stop and turn with Snowfeet as it is with regular skis. However, it's not really difficult either. You can stop the same way that you stop with skis or skates. It's also called a hockey stop. Additionally, you can also slow down with a heel brake, like with inline skates.

Snowfeet attach right to your winter shoes or snowboard boots.  They fit into a  backpack, so you can take them anywhere.  Join us and get on board with the next big winter sport!   
 
 
  In order to buy one of these coloured models, choose a specific reward. 
 




 
 
 
 
   
 We’ve already delivered thousands of pairs to our customers around the world, and the positive feedback has been overwhelming!    
 
 Snowfeet are made of highly durable and lightweight fiberglass reinforced material. Metal ski edges enable easy stopping. Heel brake lets you slow down. Adjustable bindings let you attach Snowfeet to any shoe.  
 Use them for downhill on and off the slopes, in snowparks, through forest trails, and even for cross-country skiing. 
   
 
    Just attach Snowfeet to any winter shoes or snowboard boots with bindings. We recommend waterproof shoes with ankle support for protection. 
  One size fits all. We recommend Snowfeet for shoes of size: 5-13 US / 37-47 EU (men's).  
 
 So many people are excited about this new winter sport, it is going to take the world by storm. Some even assume it will be the next Olympic sport. 

  
 
 
  We’re ready to ship the first 2000 pairs to our supporters before the end of this winter! That way, you'll get to try Snowfeet this snow season! 
 
 Snowfeet are extremely light and small, so they fit into any bag and are easy to carry around. You don’t need ski boots or any other heavy and expensive equipment. 
 
 
 

   

  Compared to skis or snowboard with all the gear, Snowfeet is super inexpensive while keeping durability, aesthetically pleasing design and overall quality. Saving money has never been easier!  

    Of course, Snowfeet are not perfect and we're not scared to admit that, because most of our customers are super delighted with their purchase anyway. Here are some downsides you should be aware of before you buy Snowfeet:Do all ski resorts allow the use of Snowfeet on their slopes?Snowfeet are a new winter sport and you might come across people who are skeptical of them. That might also happen in a ski resort. However, the base of Snowfeet is made of the exact same metal ski edges as all the other skis. Our experience is that if you act as if you were skiing with your traditional skis, no one will bother you. And if that happens anyway, argue that Snowfeet are safe and contain metal ski edges, which is the most common requirement of ski resorts. Most importantly don't forget to stay positive and friendly, which helps the most.Is it hard to learn?Learning to use Snowfeet is as hard as learning to ski. So it takes some time and you will definitely fall now and then, but that’s part of the fun? Don't forget that learning is effortless if you enjoy the ride. Can I use them in powder?You can use Snowfeet on snow that is not deeper than +/- 20 cm. Snowfeet are best on ski slopes, snow parks, forest paths and off the slopes too, just not in deep powder. Of course, Snowfeet are best on a groomed snow.Can I use them on very steep slopes?Because of their size and weight, it might not be as easy to stop and turn with Snowfeet as it is with regular skis. However, it's not really difficult either. You can stop the same way that you stop with skis or skates. It's also called a hockey stop. Additionally, you can also slow down with a heel brake, like with inline skates. To help you stay safe, we don't recommend using Snowfeet on extremely steep slopes.      Be careful! Chinese counterfeits of Snowfeet are being sold on the internetby a group of criminals. Some of them only take your money and don’t deliver the product. Buying counterfeits is dangerous and illegal. The material is very low-quality and the metal edges do not work. We’re doing everything we can to make these criminals stop the illegal activity. Please help us by reporting the counterfeits sellers on Amazon, eBay, Alibaba, Aliexpress and other platforms. We are still too small to defend ourselves alone. We highly appreciate your help!

No other portable purifier rivals the ease, speed, and versatility of the GRAYL® GEOPRESS. In only seconds, GEOPRESS makes 24oz of clean, purified drinking water – anywhere in the world! Designed for international travel, it provides complete protection by removing all waterborne pathogens (virus, bacteria, protozoan cysts) and filtering pesticides, chemicals, heavy metals, and even microplastics.
 
 Highly capable and intuitive, GEOPRESS™ is packed with innovative features to maximize utility, versatility and performance, while not sacrificing form and function. The result is a purifier that delivers unprecedented, unrivaled results.
 
 We take water safety very seriously and rigorous quality control and testing process is thorough, intensive, expensive and worth every dime. Each batch of purifier cartridges we make are thoroughly tested and meet or exceed United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Drinking Water Standards. GEOPRESS removes 99.99% of virus (e.g. Rotavirus, Norovirus, Hepatitis A), 99.9999% of bacteria (e.g. E coli, Salmonella, Dysentery), and 99.9% of protozoan cysts (e.g. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Amoebae).
 

 
 Essential tools you carry should look as good as they work. Our color lineup is inspired by locations, environments, and specific user tastes. Whether you like to lay low, or stand out, we designed a color palette that offers an attractive option for anyone.

 
 Water makes for a slippery environment. That's why we equipped GEOPRESS with TopoGrip™ technology and strategically placed it on all heavy-use surfaces needing to be grasped. It's non-slip, tactile, durable and really grippy in the heat, cold and when wet.
 
 
 The SimpleVent™ Spout Cap allows you to 'press and purify' water with the cap on. It keeps the spout clean, and protects clean water from the threat of cross-contamination (when near dirty water). During the purification process, simply twist the SimpleVent cap 1/2 turn to allow for air to escape.
 

 
 
 
 The versatility and ease-of-use of GEOPRESS is ideal for international travel and outdoor adventures. The convenience, efficiency and complete effectiveness of Fill. Press. Drink.™ is unmatched by any other water purifier (or filter). Allows anyone, anywhere, to drink from hotel sinks, beachside taco stands, public bathrooms and spigots, as well as rivers and lakes. 
 
 When we set out to design GEOPRESS, delivering on portability and convenience was integral and something we wouldn't compromise. It's perfectly sized at 24oz (710ml), and it's easy to pack, clip or carry. You'll be self-reliant, and just seconds away from making clean drinking water, anywhere. 

 
 For travelers, adventure junkies, survivalists, backpackers, hikers, campers, fly fishermen, survivalists, and anyone living in countries who have on-the-go lifestyles that demand hydration.
 

 
 
 
 Sometimes drinking from a river can be scary, even after dirty water has been purified. With GEOPRESS, you can rest assured that you can drink freely, from any freshwater source. It will remove all waterborne pathogens, and deliver clean, great tasting purified drinking water.  
 
  Virus is present in drinking water in virtually all developing countries. It's also wasteful and a burden on the planet to purchase water bottles for international adventure travel. With GEOPRESS, anyone can tap into the world’s water sources and safely drink from sketchy spigots, hotel sinks, murky rivers, wells or lakes.

trailers. Using modern design, intelligent technology, and better materials. But The Next
Generation is a project to develop a camping trailer YOU want to live
in.  More stunning than any camping trailer you have seen before, the

different?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Next Generation camping trailer
will have a fully molded fiberglass monocoque body, with axleless
suspension, lavish fittings, and smart technology.</p>
<p>The majority of camping trailers are
manufactured using a method called “vacuum laminating”, in which
sheet building materials, made up of insulation and supporting
materials, are formed using pressure. Four walls, a floor and roof are
attached together from this sheet material to build the camping
trailer.</p>
<p>Our monocoque body is one single piece
of molded fiberglass, designed to improve durability and strength,
and to weigh less than traditional models. There are no seams or
joints to suffer from water damage, which means we can make the walls
thinner, while maintaining insulation and maximizing interior space.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/423089/files/20140310004013-13.jpg?1394437213"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>Who are we?</b></h3><p>We are a group formed by enthusiasts for luxurious, intelligent and sustainable living, with a thirst to experience the amazing world around us.

GenerationThe trailer you want to go
camping in!What’s this campaign all about?
It's about YOU!Yes, we have a dream and see a new future for camping
trailers. Using modern design, intelligent technology, and better materials. But The Next
Generation is a project to develop a camping trailer YOU want to live
in.  More stunning than any camping trailer you have seen before, the
Next Generation will combine your imagination with advanced
manufacturing methods and smart technology.What makes the Next Generation
different?
The Next Generation camping trailer
will have a fully molded fiberglass monocoque body, with axleless
suspension, lavish fittings, and smart technology.
The majority of camping trailers are
manufactured using a method called “vacuum laminating”, in which
sheet building materials, made up of insulation and supporting
materials, are formed using pressure. Four walls, a floor and roof are
attached together from this sheet material to build the camping
trailer.
Our monocoque body is one single piece
of molded fiberglass, designed to improve durability and strength,
and to weigh less than traditional models. There are no seams or
joints to suffer from water damage, which means we can make the walls
thinner, while maintaining insulation and maximizing interior space.Who are we?We are a group formed by enthusiasts for luxurious, intelligent and sustainable living, with a thirst to experience the amazing world around us. Our ambitious leader Matt Attenborough has formed a team of professionals who between them have amassed more than 75 years in the RV industry.
We are also working in collaboration with academic and industry partners, including the College of Engineering at Qatar University, to help us bring your ideas to reality.We would like to thank heating
technology company Alde, which has come onboard as a partner with the
Next Generation to help us create a prototype of the RV you want to live in. We want to also thank Timbren our newest project sponsor!  Using these great Axle-Less suspension systems we know we will be setting the new standard for Caravans.Thetford is our newest sponsor!  One of the biggest providers of RV appliances and systems in the world, we are very excited to have them as a sponsor on our project!For more details check out our updates page.How will we use your support?
We want to build a prototype camping
trailer based on your suggestions and our own ideas. We have set down
$50,000 of our own hard-earned cash towards this, but we still need
to buy more materials and manufacturing molds to bring the best ideas
to life.We need a total of $125,000 to make this dream a reality, we have put up $50,000 now we need your help for the other $75,000!
As well as financial support through
this campaign, we want to give you the chance to become the designer.
Take part in high-level management meetings, discuss ideas with our
engineers and make your mark on the Next Generation all the way
through the project of building our prototype.
Come see it in person and join the partyWe invite you to join us to visit the
prototype which will be completed in time to display at the Motorhome
& Caravan Show, which takes place from 15 - 20 October 2014 at
the National Exhibition Centre, in Birmingham, UK.Then come see it at the Florida RV SuperShow from the 14 - 18 of January 2015 at the Florida State Fairgrounds, in Tampa FloridaWhat happens if we don't reach our goal?Well, we are committed to bringing this project to life!  So if we cannot reach our goal, Team Leader Matt will be heading to the bank to take out the biggest loan of his life!

<p>We take Bibles in the form of solar powered MP3 players to communicate the truth and love of Jesus Christ.  </p>
<p>We take Bibles to fight lies that are rampant in the culture which keep people mired in poverty.  One of these lies is fatalism.  Fatalism says that there is nothing I can do about my circumstances therefore why should I try to change them.</p>
<p>Another lie is that Christians cannot own a business because business is evil.  In Genesis 1, God tells us to subdue the earth.  Business is one way that we can subdue the earth.  Businesses provide goods and services necessary for people to live well.</p>
<p>We take Bibles so the Congolese Christians will know the truth.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Longer Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>On the surface, Congo Blessings is an initiative to help
relieve crushing poverty in DR Congo by teaching and encouraging people to
start and grow businesses that are capable of employing other people.  Since people in that culture share money but
not information, there is little of either to help people start
businesses.  The World Bank ranks Congo
at the sixth worst place to do business in the world which means the Congolese
government does not promote business formation. 
The result:  few jobs, per capita
GDP of $300 per year and hunger, despite incredibly fertile farm land and
natural resource wealth that exceeds $100,000 per capita.</p>
<p>A fundamental reason for poverty is that Congolese
Christians have a worldview characterized by fatalism.  Fatalism mixed with bad Christian theology says that I just have to wait
for God's blessings to appear.</p>
<p>Congo Blessings teaches the Congolese people a different
worldview while helping them start and grow businesses.  We take American business
people on short term trips to teach important concepts out of the book of
Genesis, including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">God created us in His image; therefore, we are
created to create.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">God has commanded people to subdue the earth or
use the earth’s resources for the benefit of people.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">God has designed us to work and that our work
can bring Him glory.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also teach people important business concepts like market
research, pricing, marketing, budgeting, customer service and cash
management.  These concepts are foreign
to most Congolese.  Between trips, we
continue to train and encourage people through monthly Skype calls.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we encourage people to seek Jesus
Christ, a loving, personal and powerful Savior who desires to provide for His
people.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Progress.  Americans love progress.  I love progress.</p>
<p>In the Congo, we have made great progress.  You just need a microscope to see it.  I have come to realize that worldviews change slowly and cultural change takes generations.</p>
<p>But what is the alternative?  </p>
<p>To do nothing?  </p>
<p>Not.</p>
<p>In the past five years, we have taken over 1500 Bibles to Congo.  Our strategy is to pray that God will lead us to faithful leaders who can distribute the Bibles effectively.</p>
<p>We hear stories, and they are good.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact in Stories</h3>
<p>In part, we give Bibles to effective leaders because they know where the Bibles are most needed -- often places difficult for us to reach.</p>
<p>One leader gave a Bible to a pygmy pastor who is evangelizing on a large island surrounded by Lake Kivu. The island has villages of pygmies, and is well known for its witchcraft and its witch doctors.  Their power is real. The people are victimized.  The Word of God, particularly in recorded form, is a great light.  Truth can reign.</p>
<p>We met a young Congolese filmmaker who fled Congo as a kid and walked all the way to South Africa to avoid becoming a child soldier.  When you see him, you wonder why he is short.  Then you realize he is short because he did not have enough to eat when he was young and fleeing the violence.  Now he shares the gospel as he makes a film about the tragedy that is Congo.  He visits remote villages and interviews women who have been raped by soldiers in the war that has spanned two decades.  We gave him many Bibles so that the women could hear the good news of Jesus Christ and the present hope that we have in Him.  </p>
<p>And there are more stories that we do not know.  Our prayer is that the Bibles will be an answer to the prayers of the Congolese people who receive them.  It gives me great joy to be used by God in that way.  How about you?</p>
<p>One of our effective leaders sent this picture.  There is so much in this picture. Observe and enjoy.</p>

<p>You can sponsor a Bible by doing one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">agreeing to PRAY for the recipient of the Bible and his/her ""listening group""  (just email <a href=""mailto:greg@congoblessings.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">greg@CongoBlessings.org</a>)</span></li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We personalize a ZipLoc bag that contains the Bible Player with your name and a statement that you are praying for the recipient. Your name on the ziploc bag shows the Congolese people that you hear their cry and believe they can succeed. </p>
<p>On most of the Indiegogo sites, you can get something now for a certain level of donation.  We are not offering those conventional rewards.  Instead, we remind you of a great passage in Luke 16.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Luke recorded Jesus speaking about a business manager who was about to lose his job and decided to use his rich master’s money to gain personal advantage before it was too late.  Jesus commends him for acting shrewdly, but the lesson was really for us.  Our time is limited and Jesus implies that it would be shrewd for us to use money to gain friends for eternity in heaven.  When you sponsor a Bible for someone in the Congo, you will have an opportunity to enjoy that person’s friendship in heaven forever.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>I want more people to go, to encourage the Congolese people and to experience the great joy of being used by God.</p>
<p>There are opportunities for business people, educators and others.  Two people with a passion for video have gone to teach the Congolese how to create short films.  One of them created the video on this page.  I didn't know there was a need, but God did.  He called them.  Is God calling you?</p>

Most importantly, we encourage people to seek Jesus
Christ, a loving, personal and powerful Savior who desires to provide for His
people.   The Impact Progress.  Americans love progress.  I love progress.
In the Congo, we have made great progress.  You just need a microscope to see it.  I have come to realize that worldviews change slowly and cultural change takes generations.
But what is the alternative?  
To do nothing?  
Not.
In the past five years, we have taken over 1500 Bibles to Congo.  Our strategy is to pray that God will lead us to faithful leaders who can distribute the Bibles effectively.
We hear stories, and they are good.  

The Impact in Stories
In part, we give Bibles to effective leaders because they know where the Bibles are most needed -- often places difficult for us to reach.
One leader gave a Bible to a pygmy pastor who is evangelizing on a large island surrounded by Lake Kivu. The island has villages of pygmies, and is well known for its witchcraft and its witch doctors.  Their power is real. The people are victimized.  The Word of God, particularly in recorded form, is a great light.  Truth can reign.
We met a young Congolese filmmaker who fled Congo as a kid and walked all the way to South Africa to avoid becoming a child soldier.  When you see him, you wonder why he is short.  Then you realize he is short because he did not have enough to eat when he was young and fleeing the violence.  Now he shares the gospel as he makes a film about the tragedy that is Congo.  He visits remote villages and interviews women who have been raped by soldiers in the war that has spanned two decades.  We gave him many Bibles so that the women could hear the good news of Jesus Christ and the present hope that we have in Him.  
And there are more stories that we do not know.  Our prayer is that the Bibles will be an answer to the prayers of the Congolese people who receive them.  It gives me great joy to be used by God in that way.  How about you?
One of our effective leaders sent this picture.  There is so much in this picture. Observe and enjoy.



What We Need
We ask people to sponsor a French/Swahili Bible (a solar powered MP3 player).
You can sponsor a Bible by doing one or more of the following:

agreeing to PRAY for the recipient of the Bible and his/her ""listening group""  (just email greg@CongoBlessings.org)
contributing $30 to cover the cost of the Bible
contributing additional money to cover the other costs of the trip

         
What You Get

We personalize a ZipLoc bag that contains the Bible Player with your name and a statement that you are praying for the recipient. Your name on the ziploc bag shows the Congolese people that you hear their cry and believe they can succeed. 
On most of the Indiegogo sites, you can get something now for a certain level of donation.  We are not offering those conventional rewards.  Instead, we remind you of a great passage in Luke 16.
Luke recorded Jesus speaking about a business manager who was about to lose his job and decided to use his rich master’s money to gain personal advantage before it was too late.  Jesus commends him for acting shrewdly, but the lesson was really for us.  Our time is limited and Jesus implies that it would be shrewd for us to use money to gain friends for eternity in heaven.  When you sponsor a Bible for someone in the Congo, you will have an opportunity to enjoy that person’s friendship in heaven forever.


Other Ways You Can Help

I want more people to go, to encourage the Congolese people and to experience the great joy of being used by God.
There are opportunities for business people, educators and others.  Two people with a passion for video have gone to teach the Congolese how to create short films.  One of them created the video on this page.  I didn't know there was a need, but God did.  He called them.  Is God calling you?

Mesh is not suitable for outdoor activities, as it cannot transmit data stably when it is outdoor.goTele's use of a unique advanced algorithm allows our 1W device to function over the equivalent transmission distance of a 5W walkie talkie device.     Which perk is right for you?        Thanks to our years of industry experience, we already have testing and production of our goTele units well underway. You can be confident we'll deliver your goTele units at the highest quality and on schedule!   The birth of goTele was a result of our founder’s outdoor experiences. He found that without cell service or wifi, it was extremely difficult to communicate his location to fellow adventurers. Walkie talkies were not cutting it and he strongly believed there was a better way to communicate when off the grid. That’s why he formed the team behind goTele.  Thanks to the team’s experience working in radio R&D, as well as extensive prototyping, we discovered three core requirements for an off-grid tracker: It must have great battery life, it must be completely independent of phones, and it must be able to resist the elements. goTele is IP67 rated, has a built in GPS module so it can work completely independently of your phone, and uses low power consumption and intelligent power saving technologty for excellent battery life.  We decided to bring goTele to crowdfunding because we want to share the technology with people who need it. Through crowdfunding, we will be able to gain feedback and suggestions from backers. This early feedback is extremely valuable for us. Crowdfunding also helps with mass production, logistics, and bringing our product to the market.   What is goTele?goTele is an off-grid tracker that uses GPS and long range radio technology to help you and whoever you’re with share location, communicate and stick together no matter where you are, keeping your group safe.

Boiling is the best way to make water safe. You can't always get a fire, but if you can get a boil you can greatly increase your chances of survival. -- Mykel Hawke (Host of Man Woman Wild and One Man Army, former Green Beret, and survival expert)Why We are hereThe Cauldryn team is a group of experienced outdoor industry professionals that have years of experience bringing products to life. Cauldryn represents us stepping out on our own. We know how to get a product produced and into consumer's hands, but it takes capital to start up production and to finance product in the beginning. We have the brain capital, and need your help with the financial capital. All of our prototyping you see here is fully functional, and final tooling for the product is already being produced. However, we still need to be able to pay for our first run of production. We are far enough along in the development process that I can guarantee that if this project is successfully funded you will get your rewards. In fact, we have completed all of the design work, and pre-production prototyping. We have one more round of prototypes to be produced. These will be produced on the the final production tooling (currently being built). As soon as we verify that the production samples meet our quality standards, we will launch into full production. That production will start in July. Please help us bring this awesome product across the finish line.  We are excited to be featured on BackerClub this week!

<p><strong>Q. What is the waterproof performance of the Ninebot Gokart? Can I ride in the rain? </strong></p>
<p>A: The Ninebot Gokart Kit has a waterproof grade of IPX4.  For your personal safety, outdoor riding is not recommended in unfavorable weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Why is my </strong><strong>miniPRO</strong><strong> unbalanced after I detach it from the Gokart? </strong></p>
<p>A: The miniPRO does not self-balance during Gokart Mode. To activate miniPRO for riding, riders should exit Gokart Mode on the mobile app, or manually turn off the Gokart Mode under the Setting tab.</p>

Get ready to experience the coolest electric Gokart ever with 2 motors with 800w maximum power each, 15 MPH top speed, and adjustable steering. 

  
Why have just one fun product to ride when you can have two? Instead of creating an electric gokart from scratch, we've designed the Ninebot Gokart Kit to work with the Ninebot by Segway miniPRO. Attach your miniPRO to work as the gokart's motor, or detach it and ride it hands-free.  When it comes to performance, the Ninebot Electric Gokart seeks for vehicle benchmarks beyond gokarts. The Gokart can sprint from 0 to 12mph within seconds, which matches or even outpaces the acceleration of many automobiles on the market that is well known for their outstanding performance. 
 The Ninebot Electric Gokart features a mechanical handbrake. In the unlikely event that the electric brake fails, the handbrake can be used to stop the vehicle abruptly.

The handbrake is much more than a mere braking alternative to the foot brake. The Ninebot Electric Gokart is the first gokart in the karting history that is made to drift with an equipped handbrake. Once they get familiarized with riding the Gokart, riders can challenge themselves with the drifting tail by making use of the handbrake. 

The Ninebot Electric Gokart was designed with an adjustbale frame and steering wheel to fit riders between 4' 5"" to 6' 3"" (130 cm - 190 cm). The Gokart has a maximum payload of 220 pounds (100 kg).
The adjustable frame makes the Ninebot Electric Gokart suitable and playable for people of different ages. You can create memorable experiences by driving the Gokart alongside with your family. 
The Ninebot Electric Gokart has a steering ratio of 2.1:1, allowing for precision steering and the ability to make the very tight turns.  
                                            
The Ninebot Electric Gokart comes with three driving modes for riders to choose based on their expertise. Novice mode has a top speed of 5 MPH (8 km/h), the Standard mode has a top speed of 10.8 MPH (18 km/h), and Sport mode has a top speed of 15 MPH (24 km/h).

Since the Ninebot Gokart has been designed for both children and adults, we want to make sure its being driven at a safe speed for everyone. Parents have the ability to limit the top speed of the Gokart for child riders.  
 The battery life of the Ninebot Electric Gokart varies across the different driving modes, with a maximum range of 12.4 miles (20 km). It takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge the battery.


Unlike most gokarts, the Ninebot Electric Gokart comes equipped with the ability to go in reverse. Once at a complete stop, quickly tap the brake pedal twice and the gokart is now in reverse. When stopped, tap it twice again to go back to forward.  

The Ninebot Electric Gokart is collapsible to fit in most trunks, allowing you to take it wherever you want to go.

Connect your Gokart to the app via Bluetooth to display driving speed, cruising range, and fault reminders of the Gokart in real-time. You can also access the new rider tutorial, control lighting, set driving modes, update firmware, and more.
  With our commitment to product development and manufacturing, every aspect of the Ninebot Gokart was meticulously designed and developed to ensure a high-quality product.
  

The Ninebot Electric Gokart comes with the Gokart Kit and a miniPRO320. The Gokart Kit contains a steering wheel, seat, front bumper, and front wheels. The Gokart Kit is fitted over the miniPRO320, which functions as the rear wheels and powertrain for the Gokart.
The package size of Ninebot Gokart Kit is GIGANTIC! To give you a better idea about the packaging size, we compare it with a 29-inch luggage and a 13-inch MacBook Pro in the image above. Since we are shipping all orders from the United States, it is too hard for us to cover the extra shipping cost to the rest of the world for such a huge item. We thank you for your support and hope you can understand why there is an extra charge for orders outside the United States.


For those riders looking to go a bit farther in their travels, the Ninebot by Segway miniPRO320 offers extended range thanks to its 310Wh battery. With its unique knee control bar, the miniPRO allows you more interaction with your environment than any other two-wheel ride.

Update: To all backer from Indemand, due to lack of stock, we can only send the new version of Ninebot S to replace miniPRO320. 
 
Easily retrofit your miniPRO with the Gokart Kit: disassemble the knee control bar on the miniPRO; attach the Gokart Kit to the miniPRO; adjust the frame; adjust the steering wheels; insert batteries.Electric Gokart Exclusive Offer $1299 (MSRP $1450)

Q. What is the waterproof performance of the Ninebot Gokart? Can I ride in the rain? 
A: The Ninebot Gokart Kit has a waterproof grade of IPX4.  For your personal safety, outdoor riding is not recommended in unfavorable weather conditions.
Q. Why is my miniPRO unbalanced after I detach it from the Gokart?

<h3>About This Campaign</h3>

<p>Roman and Snow are some of the most genuine and caring people I
know. Totally in love with each other, they decided to get married this fall on September 14.
However, no honeymoon is planned because of their present financial
circumstances.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Typically selfless, Roman and Snow initially planned to spend the little money
they have to organize a joint-honeymoon for their parents, which they hope will
bless their parents' marriage. But due to lack of resources, their kind thought
didn't come to fruition. As Roman’s coworker, I know personally that he’s been
working VERY HARD in the past few months by juggling a few jobs at once to pay
for his wedding and prepare for his marriage. All these are on top of his
practice and performance schedule with the church's worship team - what a
dedicated man of God he is!</span></p>

With PESU you’ll find that extra power to go even further. Go beyond the end of the trail and explore a new path. Finally, a true, no-compromise, electric powered mountain bike that is unbelievably fun and undeniably practical.Electric bikes expand your boundaries. Do more and see more. Incredibly fun, unquestionably practical. With extra power and pedal assistance, every ride will be pure joy. The PESU Team will be exhibiting at two of the world’s largest bike exhibitions, the Eurobike and Interbike. Learn more about our e-bikes and other products there -- you’ll get to try them too!   Our mission is to make an e-bike that is truly fun. One that will enhance your riding experience and help you expand your boundaries, to go further, while not making your legs sore next day. We want to create an e-bike that inspires you to explore further, go off the beaten path and most importantly -- keep moving forward. In order to do that we had to push boundaries and look beyond the standard procedure.An industry first approach - our PESU e-bikes are designed in conjunction with our drive unit. Every detail has been redefined so our drive unit matches our bikes and vice versa, which all match our mission perfectly.Fastest Motor Response Time As mentioned -- our mission is to create an e-bike that is truly fun. We weren’t satisfied with the other drive unit’s response time on the market right now, so we went and created our own. From 2015, we decided to self-develop and patent our own torque sensor. The torque sensor is a type of throttle that determines how much juice to feed the motor based on how hard you are pedaling.With our own patented torque sensor, our drive unit response time has been reduced to just10ms. Other drive unit brands like Yamaha or Bosch have a response time of around 50ms. Having a quicker response time allows for a more intuitive riding experience. Just pedal and go.Highly Efficient Drive UnitTweaked and designed in conjunction with our PESU e-bikes, it is a match made in heaven. In the manufacturing process of the motor body, we adopted an advanced automation equipment, achieving a fully automatic winding, magnetic paste, and through high-temperature curing and radial magnetization technology, greatly improves the consistency of the motor body to ensure that the motor is efficiently output.This is why our drive unit is quicker, lighter and faster than even the industry leaders.  Powerful, With Natural Assist Characteristics 
Don't be fooled by its compact size, our drive unit can conquer 40-degree inclines with ease. Most other drive units on the market can only ride up to 30-degree hills.  With a total of four outputs, the PESU is suitable for every ride. Whether you’re riding to work (sweat-free!), climbing a steep hill or going downhill, or even when you’re walking the bike (we’ve developed a walking assistance mode), the PESU makes the ride easier than any other bike on the market.Go Beyond The End of Trials  Having a good e-bike and a drive unit is not enough. In order to let you enjoy as PESU as much as possible - we had to redefine on how we optimize the battery.With our e-bike you can go up to 100 miles on a single charge. We've spent days and nights optimizing the battery, using professional approaches found in other major industries. With us, you can go further, do more, see more.Read Your Speed. Intuitive & ClearEasily read the data you need through our connected cycling computer. Featuring a clear 3-inch screen, which makes it visible under all circumstances. Our cycling computer is directly connected to the battery and with our built-in sensors you'll be able to read: • Battery level• Speed (current, average and max)• Distance (total, and current interval)• Output modeDesigned for Fun Current e-bikes are bulky and heavy. We wanted to build a true, no-compromise, e-powered mountain bike that is unbelievably fun and undeniably practical. Turn every ride into a pure enjoyment. Ride to places where you couldn’t go before.The Shortest Chainstay on any electric bikes A huge part of why the PESU e-bikes are fun to ride is because of the short chainstay design. A shorter chainstays increases maneuverability, which makes handling the PESU easier and more fun. We tested 20 different chainstay iterations before we were satisfied with the design. Our final design has a chain stay length of only 43.5cm, which makes it one of the shortest chainstays on an electric mountain bike. This makes you better to handle the bike and makes it more playful. As your weight is naturally farther back in the bike, you can even pop wheelies easier.Designed to absorb shockEvery detail matters. Our frame was specifically designed for shock absorption. For more specific details check this out: 1. Our tapered headtube allows you to absorb more shocks and gain more control. 2. We’ve selected suspension forks to give you total control and comfort. The damping needs to work with the spring action and give you a consistent feel. 3. With an extra reinforced tube into the top tube and seat tube, it’ll give you and the frame extra strength when you need it. Do more and handle more.  4. We know that riding bikes extensively, you may need to replace the cables and parts sometime. That is why we opted-in for internal cable routing, which allows you to easily replace the brake/gear cables, while protecting it against dirt and tangled cables.5. Our short chainstay design also fixes another problem: tangled chains. We’ve reduced the possibility of getting your chains tangled by moving the chainstay into a position that is protecting the chains, rather than hindering it.6. Our frame is designed to provide easy access with a low-step over. Quickly jump on your PESU electric bike and ride away. This does not mean our frame has less strength: our reinforced tube will give you the strength when needed.We made two models of PESU e-bikes - VOLADOR and MONSTER - to suit everyone’s need. These two models are different in frame design, component choice, and motor system. We developed two models to suit different needs.Unleash the power with PESU MONSTER PESU MONSTER is a 27.5"" cross country electric mountain bike. You can choose to go with either 250W (Efficient EX) or 350W drive unit (Efficient ET). The MONSTER frame features a tapered head tube to enhance more stability and absorb shocks. Designed with a low step top tube, it gives you easy access and more convenience. We’ve chosen for the SR SUNTOUR XCM 100mm suspension fork, together with 180mm disc brakes.The TTIUM Efficient mid-driving system offers 4 modes of power output within 10ms, cyclists will have full control of the bike. MONSTER is suitable for mountain bike trails, paved surface, and roads.Conquer mountains with PESU VOLADOR PESU VOLADOR is a 27.5"" all mountain electric bike with the 350W TTIUM Powerful PT drive unit.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As many lake-goers at Conesus know, weather is pretty random all of the time. It rains,
    it gets windy, sometimes
    you get the thunderstorms - All of which you can just look at a normal forecast for. But what about the water?
    Is is rough out, maybe too rough to boat safely? Is the water freezing or just right for swimming? All of which
    is privately monitored or not monitored at all. Thats where building and placing a weather buoy would come
    in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I'm Zachary DuBois. My main hobby is
    problem solving, coding, and
    building things to make life easier. I am going to be teamed up with my cousin to build a data-logging weather
    buoy that will monitor over 30 different water and air sensors and report to a website that will be publicly
    available for everyone. This includes, water turbidity (clarity/color), temperature, wave data (amplitude,
    frequency, direction), and many others listed below.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All of this data is useful for fishing, checking to see if it would be good to go
    boating, swimming, letting you
    know if the water rises above your dock, and checking if it is a good swim day. And of course, it can be used
    for scientific research of the lake to find more trends and possibly predicting as we gather more data. But
    collecting the amount of data we want requires quite a bit of equipment which is where you can help us out. A
    lot of the equipment is out of a high schooler's price range - Hence the campaign.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">What We Need</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We need contributions to be able to afford to build this buoy. We estimate it to be
    $5,000 but
    have made our goal to be $7,500 to account in the a safety price incase a component breaks or we need to make a
    major change while we are building it. Any excess money that cannot be put towards a stretch goal below will be
    donated to the Conesus Lake Association and/or a charity. A full price breakdown with all the parts and their prices
    will be available in a few days of the campaign going live.</p><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Supporting our project will definitely place you permanently as someone who help this
    project happen on the
    website and you will receive a thank you email from me to show my thanks. You also receive what is indicated on
    the perk you select. Perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Your name on the website and an email from me thanking you.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">A personal thank you letter from me sent to you.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Meeting and a full tour of the buoy before it is put in the water.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">You signature on a permanent sign in clear view on board the buoy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Code will be fully open-sourced and available on GitHub.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Design and wiring diagrams will also be published and open-source (All the hardware
        is not open-source however).
    </li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Sensor data is live every minute and will available for everyone publicly.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">User accounts can set up alerts for temperatures, no swim advisories, no boating
        advisories, bad weather
        conditions, and water depth warnings.<br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Indefinite data history allowing for the creation of trends and looking back at
        weather patterns.
    </li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Developer friendly with a JSON API and web hooks.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">All power comes from the solor panels leaving no power costs or pollution.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Power is stored in two on-board 250AhSLA (Sealed Lead Acid) batteries which
        provides enough power for the entire buoy to run for more than two days receiving no power from the solar
        panels.

As many lake-goers at Conesus know, weather is pretty random all of the time. It rains,
    it gets windy, sometimes
    you get the thunderstorms - All of which you can just look at a normal forecast for. But what about the water?
    Is is rough out, maybe too rough to boat safely? Is the water freezing or just right for swimming? All of which
    is privately monitored or not monitored at all. Thats where building and placing a weather buoy would come
    in.
I'm Zachary DuBois. My main hobby is
    problem solving, coding, and
    building things to make life easier. I am going to be teamed up with my cousin to build a data-logging weather
    buoy that will monitor over 30 different water and air sensors and report to a website that will be publicly
    available for everyone. This includes, water turbidity (clarity/color), temperature, wave data (amplitude,
    frequency, direction), and many others listed below.
All of this data is useful for fishing, checking to see if it would be good to go
    boating, swimming, letting you
    know if the water rises above your dock, and checking if it is a good swim day. And of course, it can be used
    for scientific research of the lake to find more trends and possibly predicting as we gather more data. But
    collecting the amount of data we want requires quite a bit of equipment which is where you can help us out. A
    lot of the equipment is out of a high schooler's price range - Hence the campaign.
What We Need
We need contributions to be able to afford to build this buoy. We estimate it to be
    $5,000 but
    have made our goal to be $7,500 to account in the a safety price incase a component breaks or we need to make a
    major change while we are building it. Any excess money that cannot be put towards a stretch goal below will be
    donated to the Conesus Lake Association and/or a charity. A full price breakdown with all the parts and their prices
    will be available in a few days of the campaign going live.What You Get
Supporting our project will definitely place you permanently as someone who help this
    project happen on the
    website and you will receive a thank you email from me to show my thanks. You also receive what is indicated on
    the perk you select. Perks include:

Your name on the website and an email from me thanking you.
A personal thank you letter from me sent to you.
Meeting and a full tour of the buoy before it is put in the water.
You signature on a permanent sign in clear view on board the buoy.

Features

Code will be fully open-sourced and available on GitHub.
Design and wiring diagrams will also be published and open-source (All the hardware
        is not open-source however).
    
Sensor data is live every minute and will available for everyone publicly.
User accounts can set up alerts for temperatures, no swim advisories, no boating
        advisories, bad weather
        conditions, and water depth warnings.

Indefinite data history allowing for the creation of trends and looking back at
        weather patterns.
    
Developer friendly with a JSON API and web hooks.
All power comes from the solor panels leaving no power costs or pollution.
Power is stored in two on-board 250AhSLA (Sealed Lead Acid) batteries which
        provides enough power for the entire buoy to run for more than two days receiving no power from the solar
        panels.
    

Sensors & Equipment

Stretch Add-ons
If we exceed our goal, we want to create a few other small projects to go with this
    buoy. They are listed below.

Weather kiosk in the boat launch.
Another buoy? :)

What Happens If We Don't Reach The Goal?
If we were to not reach our goal we have a few fallback plans detailed below.

If we don't reach our goal but have enough raised to create parts of the buoy
        (including the buoy itself), we
        will send out a vote to all the backers of the project on what sensors are most important to them. With the
        selected items, we will build the buoy.
    
If we don't reach our goal and don't have enough to create the buoy, we will send
        out a vote to the backers to
        pick a charity that the money will be donated to.
If we exceed the goal by enough to invite backers to a cookout, we will plan and
        set everything up.
    
If we reallyexceed our goal, we will throw a cookout for the backers
        and include a lot of extra
        sensors and features. Any excess after this will be donated to a charity after a vote.
    
Then there is the possibility we have enough to build two or a few and place them
        around the lake to gather even
        more trends and improve the accuracy.
    

Risks & Challenges
As with any project of this scale, there are some major risks and challenges that we
    will have to overcome.
    Some of our risks are:

Not getting enough interest to be funded.
The buoy getting damaged by watercraft, lightning, sinking from being flipped, or
        even stolen (GPS will be
        equipped on the buoy).
    

And our challenges:

Creating a buoy that will be stable enough not to flip from extreme winds and
        wake.
    
Ensuring a safe and dry environment for the non-waterproof equipment.
Create accurate and calibrated measurements.
Keeping no carbon footprint by using solar to keep an on-board rechargeable battery
        or super-capacitor bank
        charged.
    
Keeping the buoy modular to ensure that parts can be replaced easily and ensure for
        easy maintenance.
    
Ensuring the sun cannot damage our equipment through the use of UV radiation
        shields.
    
Attempting to get the buoy recognized as a data collector for several weather
        services.
    
Ensuring that the only power can withstand multiple days without getting sunlight -
        Also ensuring the entire
        buoy does not draw too much power.

contents is undeniably justified especially when luggage is left unattended <b>in airport,

valuable items, often travelers left with little option but to subject themselves hand-carrying
heavy multiple-bags choking up limited flight cabins spaces and jamming up aisles during

<b>LOCK = SECURITY</b>. <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Locks essentially means '<b>SECURITY</b>'. A luggage lock that is easily cracked or <b>FAILS</b> to secure your belongings while integrating with many other secondary features like remote unlocking, GPS tracking, weighting scale etc. just does not SOUND right to be categorized as a lock - <i>it is simply a 'tech gimmick or toy' at best! </i> </p>
<p></p>
<p>We believe that as a lock or locking device for a luggage, its vital <b>PRIMARY</b> function is to ensure <b>security/protection</b>. Therefore, we focus on perfecting its PRIMARY functions while integrating other secondary functions such as ease-of-use, vicinity tracking etc. to enhance users' travel experience.  </p>
<p>In line with that, we have chosen Near Field Communication (NFC) as our PRIMARY unlocking/access technology. Unlike Bluetooth or RFID, <b>NFC</b> is designed with vital focus in <b>security</b> and has been well-known as the <b>De Facto technology</b> for <b>mobile secured cash payment/transaction</b>. eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is optimized for proximity access with the accompanied <b>Smart</b> <b>NFC-driven </b>Fobs/Tags. </p>
<p>Proprietary communication protocol and encryption technologies are deployed to prevent unauthorized attempts to extract stored access codes and an electronic luggage tag containing luggage owner's information.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is implemented in eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock mainly for the Displacement/Locational <b>vicinity</b> <b>tracking</b> (<i>patented feature)</i> allowing travellers to be alerted when their unattended luggage/travel bags have been moved/displaced unknowingly in scenario such as; when resting/taking a catnap or having a meal during airport transit while waiting for boarding etc. </p>
<p>Bluetooth is also incorporated here as a <b>SECONDARY</b> (alternative) access method to accommodate those users who <b>prioritize convenience</b> over high access security depending on personal unique preference and individual circumstances. </p>

</div><div>eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is powered by 2 standard LR44/A76 button batteries easily available in the market. Who needs a rechargeable battery when yours can last for <b>2000-3000</b> locking/unlocking cycles or approx. <b>3 years </b>depending on your usage? Assuming 9 months of continuous usage in a
year and every day turn on/off 3 times i.e. (9/12)x 365days a year x 3 (times
daily) x <b>3 years</b> = <b>2463</b> times. Simply change the batteries when they run out which only takes you a couple of minutes. In the event when batteries die despite notification from App, you may still use a standard <b>external USB mobile power source</b> (e.g. your Laptop PC or USB power bank) to power up eGeeTouch® smart lock via the USB terminal provided, and then proceeds with unlocking as usual.</div><div><br/></div><div>In fact, rechargeable batteries are typically more expensive, while cheap rechargeable batteries often has low life-span that resulted to shorter operating life for lock as well.</div><div> </div><div>

Response was overwhelming and we won the 2016 CES Innovation Award once again under Tech for Better World category for 2 years consecutively sustaining our position as a prolific innovator in smart locks. We exhibited at Tech West: Sands Expo, Hall G, Level 1, Booth No.: #81019.   WHAT is eGeeTouch® SMART TRAVEL PADLOCK?eGeeTouch® Smart Travel Padlock is a World's-1st, Patented & 2015 CES Award-winning innovation embedded with DUAL state-of-art proximity access and vicinity tracking technologies to deliver the Ultimate Peace of Mind & Hassle-Free experience in securing your personal belongings in your luggage and/or travel bags; requiring No Key, No Digit-Wheels Dial & No Code Memorizing. Simply One-Touch to unlock using your preferred method from any of these available convenient choices such as encrypted NFC-enabled AND Bluetooth-enabled smartphones, smart wearable/devices including smart watch/sport-bands, NFC Fobs/Tags/Sticker and others. This TSA-accepted eGeeTouch Travel Padlock with smart identification is optimized for access with Smart NFC Fobs/Tags. It also works with iOS & Android smart devices (via Bluetooth mode) such as smartphones, Sportbands etc. in conjunction with an App.
Coupled with proprietary authentication
protocols generating over 100-million user's defined encrypted
IDs, Audit Trails recording WHO,
WHEN and WHERE access were made, and Vicinity tracking (patented features) to alert users when there is unwanted displacement of their luggage and/or travel bags; users are assured of ultra-high security
protection.  
Winning the 2015 CES innovation award and being granted the USPTO patent validate eGeeTouch® as the pioneer for introducing world's first Smart Luggage Lock to the travel industry. Our radical innovation has essentially transformed an isolated piece of conventional hardware lock into
an interconnected leading-edge Internet of Things (IoT) for luggage. This smart luggage lock is strategically created based on the concept of Disruptive Innovation that deliberately seeks to replace those out-dated and cumbersome conventional luggage padlocks.
In essence, its a ""FREAKING AWESOME"" smart lock. C'est parfait, oui?









Lock is well known as an indispensable component and integral part of a luggage or travel bag
providing its owner most basic form of securing personal belongings during a trip. However, its functionality is indisputably cumbersome and security
performance is unquestionably low as have not been keeping up with changes of modern
society of increasing highly mobile travelers. Further, concerns over the security of luggage’s valuable
contents is undeniably justified especially when luggage is left unattended in airport,
train, ferry compartments or hotel concierge area. To avoid anxiety of losing checked-in
valuable items, often travelers left with little option but to subject themselves hand-carrying
heavy multiple-bags choking up limited flight cabins spaces and jamming up aisles during
boarding. These were unfortunate tradeoffs and unnecessary anxiety experienced by many frequent travelers and holiday makers. 
eGeeTouch team sets to address these constrains/limitations with the ultimate aim to enable travellers to have a truly hassle-free & peace-of-mind  experiences. We relentlessly refine of our patented invention and strongly believe that we have the BEST solution (with RIGHT priority) to address critical common problems faced by millions of travellers who are still using conventional key/digit-wheel travel locks on their luggage: 


Conventional travel lock is low in security and can be easily cracked in seconds. YouTube videos on 'how to crack conventional combination and keyed locks' are readily available online and millions of people are watching.

Unnecessary stress over remembering & forgetting password/code. Resort to using easily cracked password like ""123"" that compromised the security.

Hassle over handling many keys, missing or misplaced keys due to infrequent usage of luggage.
Anxiety and strain over dialling those cumbersome tiny digit-wheels of combination locks, particularly challenging for elderly in dimly illuminated room.
Would be nice to have other functions that allows better travel experience such as: Access traceability, Vicinity tracking & Location searching, and more.


Over 7 years of in-depth research and development has resulted in a PCT utility patent filed in 2010 and publicised at WIPO in 2012 covering over 100 countries worldwide & USPTO granted in 2015 - US Pat. No. 9,121,199 B2 and a design patent - US D721, 261 S. The legal intellectual property right is owned by DIGIPAS USA LLC. Numerous patents were further filed to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and extending national phase to many countries to reach wider jurisdictions.

MIND-BLOWING FEATURES:






LOCK = SECURITY. 

Locks essentially means 'SECURITY'. A luggage lock that is easily cracked or FAILS to secure your belongings while integrating with many other secondary features like remote unlocking, GPS tracking, weighting scale etc. just does not SOUND right to be categorized as a lock - it is simply a 'tech gimmick or toy' at best!  

We believe that as a lock or locking device for a luggage, its vital PRIMARY function is to ensure security/protection. Therefore, we focus on perfecting its PRIMARY functions while integrating other secondary functions such as ease-of-use, vicinity tracking etc. to enhance users' travel experience.  
In line with that, we have chosen Near Field Communication (NFC) as our PRIMARY unlocking/access technology. Unlike Bluetooth or RFID, NFC is designed with vital focus in security and has been well-known as the De Facto technology for mobile secured cash payment/transaction. eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is optimized for proximity access with the accompanied Smart NFC-driven Fobs/Tags. 
Proprietary communication protocol and encryption technologies are deployed to prevent unauthorized attempts to extract stored access codes and an electronic luggage tag containing luggage owner's information.
Bluetooth is implemented in eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock mainly for the Displacement/Locational vicinity tracking (patented feature) allowing travellers to be alerted when their unattended luggage/travel bags have been moved/displaced unknowingly in scenario such as; when resting/taking a catnap or having a meal during airport transit while waiting for boarding etc. 
Bluetooth is also incorporated here as a SECONDARY (alternative) access method to accommodate those users who prioritize convenience over high access security depending on personal unique preference and individual circumstances. 




If you prefer to access the smartlock using your own smart devices, you are required to download an eGeeTouch® iOS & Android app (via Bluetooth mode).






Share usage of the lock and/or luggage/travel bags with greater peace of mind. These smart travel padlock keeps a record of the access history for traceability which can be sync with the mobile devices providing accountability and added security. 




eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is the World's 1st & Only Smart Travel Padlock accepted by the Transport Security Authority (TSA) allowing travelers to pass through mandatory security checkpoints without the risk of having their luggage and/or travel bags forced/cut open by custom officers during security checks at airports. TSA Custom officers are authorized to cut and/or force open any luggage/travel bags that cannot be unlocked using the TSA Master Keys for inspection. 


In addition, eGeeTouch® Travel Padlocks are also compatible with worldwide major transport regulatory requirements for safety and security, and in compliance with the standards of International Air Transport Association (IATA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) that has stringent on-board requirements on Lithium Battery and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) RF Emission. Furthermore, the smart lock is also in the process of being tested by accredited 3rd party independent test providers, TUV SUD and SGS for conformance to FCC, CE and RoHS safety regulatory standards. its earlier generic version has been tested and passed all stated regulatory standards.

Truly enjoy your CATNAP or MEAL in peace thanks to the embedded Bluetooth vicinity sensor that will alert you through your mobile app when your luggage and/or travel bags get moved/displaced from you beyond a certain distance.



Now that we have taken care of the main security features,  let's see how we have taken care of broad spectrum of users' unlocking choices/options and amazing convenient we have made it available for you.
eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is optimized for access via Smart NFC Fobs/Tags/Sticker/Cards. Users may also unlock using their Android & iOS smartphones via Bluetooth and other NFC and/or Bluetooth-enabled wearables or devices such as smart watch/sport band etc. With so many options and choices, there must be a way or two to cater to everyone's liking/preference from the young to the senior.
The following videos demonstrate how easily various unlocking choices are performed. Check out Video on other eGeeTouch products HERE.









eGeeTouch® Travel Padlock is powered by 2 standard LR44/A76 button batteries easily available in the market. Who needs a rechargeable battery when yours can last for 2000-3000 locking/unlocking cycles or approx. 3 years depending on your usage? Assuming 9 months of continuous usage in a
year and every day turn on/off 3 times i.e. (9/12)x 365days a year x 3 (times
daily) x 3 years = 2463 times. Simply change the batteries when they run out which only takes you a couple of minutes. In the event when batteries die despite notification from App, you may still use a standard external USB mobile power source (e.g. your Laptop PC or USB power bank) to power up eGeeTouch® smart lock via the USB terminal provided, and then proceeds with unlocking as usual.In fact, rechargeable batteries are typically more expensive, while cheap rechargeable batteries often has low life-span that resulted to shorter operating life for lock as well. 




eGeeTouch® smart travel padlocks are not waterproof. They are IP 43 water resistance which essentially means withstanding a slashing water or a few minutes of rain. Its electronic board is coated with a layer of water resistance material. Likewise to most electronic products, when prolonged splashing with or completely submerging into water, the batteries drain out quickly. Simply ensure the lock is completely dry and then install new batteries to regain its function. This travel smartlock operates in wide humidity environment (20% to 90%) as well as broad range of operating temperature (-20°C to +50°C). 




These Smart Travel Padlocks are rigorously tested in our lab and factory facility in according to ISO9002 and ISO14001 to deliver high quality and durability to withstand a broad range of road, sea and air travel conditions. These smart locks undergoes drop/impact, humidity, temperature & thermal shock tests. They are designed and tested with rigour to perform within the stated specification.

Imagine a fishing lure that behaves just like a real bait fish, but without you having to constantly jig it or retrieve it to keep it moving. Well now there is... eMinnow is a preprogrammed fully motorized fishing lure that mimics the swimming movements and patterns, of REAL bait fish, including pauses, speeding up, slowing down and regular live action.

eMinnow is a preprogrammed FULLY motorized fishing lure.   
eMinnow lures are perfectly balanced and designed to attract predator fish not only by the realistic swimming action but also by the vibration and harmonic frequency of the constantly moving motor. Game fish like, Bass, Pike, Muskie, Trout, Walleye, Perch, Crappie, even Salmon simply can’t resist  eMinnow. We have extensively tested eMinnow over the past 2 years and its has proved to be devastatingly effective.   
Fishing is an awesome pastime, but the fun can often be quite drawn out when there is nothing biting your line. You can only be patient for so long, until you are ready to pack up and call it a day. eMinnow is the solution! It's ""the most effective lure EVER, lasts MUCH longer that live bait"", makes a modulated harmonic clicking sound that predator fish simply can't ignore, and keeps a realistic movement to lure the target fish in. In fact, live bait fish often expire or stop moving after 10 or 15 minutes, eMinnow keeps going ! The design and materials are state of the art and the battery operated movement is timed perfectly.
eMinnow automatically starts as soon as it hits the water and stops when its taken out of the water. The water completes the circuit (see below). 

Using eMinnow is very easy.    You simply attach it to your line instead of a regular lure or bait.  As soon as the eMinnow hits the water, it begins to SWIM and make a unique clicking sound that catches the attention of the target fish.

<p>My name is John Steck Jr. and I am a visual artist, with a focus in photography. Originally from Chicago, I have lived in Boston, San Francisco, and currently reside in Reykjavik, Iceland. This summer, I started two large bodies of work on the island of Iceland while at both the Gullkistan Residency for Creative People and the SIM Residency. These projects focus on two different experiences of the bodies of water in and around Iceland, both as a meditative and visceral experience. Due to the high cost of my travels and the high ambitions of these projects, I am asking for your help in supporting these projects in return for a unique piece of my experience here in Iceland.</p>
<p>Growing up in the city of Chicago, right off of Lake Michigan, I felt as though I lived alongside an ocean because of the horizon line. I always wondered what other world existed on the other side of this lake. This idea took on greater meaning for me during the 8 years I spent in Boston, off the coast of the Atlantic, and two years spent in San Francisco, next to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the concept of the sublime and its relationship to the physical aspects of the the horizon became apparent in the images I was making for a series I called Horizo. These images, while offering contemplation of the worlds that exist beyond them, focused on the physicality of the horizon line itself, and how it’s possible to collapse that space we often feel is gigantic and treat it as something much more tactile and smaller.</p>
<p>I was always extremely fascinated with the idea of going to Iceland. In my mind, it is a place unlike the rest of the world with experiences I could never imagine. I feel that while I have been on this island, surrounded on all sides by the ocean, that there is nowhere else but here. Nowhere to reach out or imagine.</p>
<p>The previous ideas in my work, along with my experiences in Iceland, led me to these two new projects. The first project is in the same manner as my Horizo series, of photographing the horizon line of the ocean. I wish to do so from as many coastal towns of Iceland as possible, to have a complete 360 view of this grand spatial exterior. Composing these scenes thus far has allowed me to turn around and look inward with more focus on the details of the interior of Iceland, with more understanding of scale and significance.</p>
<p>This idea has led to the second section of images I have pursued, which focuses on the lakes of Iceland. It is my goal to photograph as many lakes as I can on the island, to show a different kind of connection of land and water, how the scale shift can reverse, and how the land can be more powerful and, at times, overbearing.</p>
<p>I like to think of these projects as a meditative way to lead me through the entirety of what has been a new space and experience for me, and where that will lead within my work.</p>
<p>I have decided to stay here in Iceland for a third month to complete these two projects, along with several other smaller ones. Because these residencies are independently run and not funded through the government, they are not able to help financially support the projects that their residents pursue. Due to the financial costs of boarding, transportation, photography expenses, and other various travel needs, I cannot complete these projects alone.</p>
<p>The importance of this project to me, both as a visual study that I feel is a relevant way to interpret a space and the spiritual journey this continues to be for myself, is great. I hope you will consider sharing this adventure with me. In return, as a way to express my gratitude, I offer six different rewards for you in return. They range from custom-made mixed cds of Icelandic music, one of a kind prints, and handmade artist books. There is something for everybody. I hope you will join me in this journey.</p>

These images, while offering contemplation of the worlds that exist beyond them, focused on the physicality of the horizon line itself, and how it’s possible to collapse that space we often feel is gigantic and treat it as something much more tactile and smaller.
I was always extremely fascinated with the idea of going to Iceland. In my mind, it is a place unlike the rest of the world with experiences I could never imagine. I feel that while I have been on this island, surrounded on all sides by the ocean, that there is nowhere else but here. Nowhere to reach out or imagine.
The previous ideas in my work, along with my experiences in Iceland, led me to these two new projects. The first project is in the same manner as my Horizo series, of photographing the horizon line of the ocean. I wish to do so from as many coastal towns of Iceland as possible, to have a complete 360 view of this grand spatial exterior. Composing these scenes thus far has allowed me to turn around and look inward with more focus on the details of the interior of Iceland, with more understanding of scale and significance.
This idea has led to the second section of images I have pursued, which focuses on the lakes of Iceland. It is my goal to photograph as many lakes as I can on the island, to show a different kind of connection of land and water, how the scale shift can reverse, and how the land can be more powerful and, at times, overbearing.
I like to think of these projects as a meditative way to lead me through the entirety of what has been a new space and experience for me, and where that will lead within my work.
I have decided to stay here in Iceland for a third month to complete these two projects, along with several other smaller ones. Because these residencies are independently run and not funded through the government, they are not able to help financially support the projects that their residents pursue. Due to the financial costs of boarding, transportation, photography expenses, and other various travel needs, I cannot complete these projects alone.
The importance of this project to me, both as a visual study that I feel is a relevant way to interpret a space and the spiritual journey this continues to be for myself, is great. I hope you will consider sharing this adventure with me. In return, as a way to express my gratitude, I offer six different rewards for you in return. They range from custom-made mixed cds of Icelandic music, one of a kind prints, and handmade artist books. There is something for everybody. I hope you will join me in this journey.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

All New Collapsible LANTERN Diffuser-S
In a continuing effort to improve our products, we have taken the feedback received from our first LANTERN Diffuser and created this next generation of diffuser. Many of you told us the original diffuser was amazing and worked great, but it was bulky and hard to pack or store.
Our new silicone collapsible LANTERN Diffuser brings all the benefits of our original diffuser but with minimal bulk. This diffuser collapses to a small size and is light weight, making it super easy to pack and store. You can now take the LANTERN Light and diffuser with you anywhere.

the problem
Everyone knows how agonizing it is to hold that untouchably hot metal utensil handle, how frustrating it is to see that wooden handle with scorch marks and how ugly your melted plastic utensil handle looks because its been resting on the edge of the pan that has been on the stove for too long. Not to mention the melted plastic from spatula heads getting into your food! Also, does the spoon slipping into the serving dish sound familiar? How about those messy drips when you move your spoon from the pot to the spoon rest? Arghh.. the nifty solutionThese problems are ubiquitous and have been existing in our kitchens for ages. Looking at these common problems, we conducted a survey and we were not at all surprised by the feedback. Every single person who took the survey faced the same exact problems and was eager for a solution. 

This is when we started drawing the picture of a simple yet elegant gadget in our mind, this one single solution, that will take care of all the above problems. After months of brain storming, mechanical and industrial design, several iterations of prototypes, feedback from trial groups and intense testing, we came up with an optimally engineered, aesthetically seductive and Patent Pending innovation – The Snug.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Less than two years ago, I started the Love and London Youtube channel so that I could help visitors to London to have the trip of a lifetime here in my city. It's turned into even more than that, with a community of over 30,000 people that are my motivation to keep creating useful videos, email newsletters, and social media content every day.</p>
<p>In response to hundreds of questions from our community and over 600 responses to my recent viewer survey, it's time for me to finally create what you guys have asked for-- a one-stop-shop guide to London, of all of my local recommendations.</p>

<h3>What's going to be in the guide?</h3>
<p>If you think that this is going to similar to one of those guides you can find online for free, or can pick up at the bookstore, you'll be disappointed (in a good way).</p>
<p><u><i>This guide includes:</i></u></p>
<p>1. A <strong>mega-PDF</strong> with every single one of the recommendations that I give my own family and friends when they come to London-- my favourite places in London. This includes food spots for all budgets, a few of my favourite bars to sip a cocktail, and the things to do around the city that gives you more of a ""local"" experience. </p>
<p>2. My irk with traditional travel guides is that they don't tell you how close a recommendation is to where you are at the moment. London is MASSIVE and you shouldn't be traveling 45+ minutes across the city every time you want to eat a good meal. So you'll get my <strong>Google Map with all of my recommendations pinpointed on it</strong>, so whenever you feel hungry or need something to do, you can pull out your phone and see what's closest to where you are at the moment, and get directions too.</p>
<p>3. Getting the guide also gives you membership to a <strong>private Love and London Facebook group</strong>, where you can connect with other future visitors to London, ask each other questions, and essentially be a part of a ""London visitor support group"".</p>
<p><u><i>Consistent updates</i></u></p>
<p>Another think that irks me about traditional guides is that you have to buy brand new ones every year in order to make sure you've got up-to-date information. Even if you find information online, you might not be able to tell how recently it was written.</p>
<p>So if you purchase my guide, you'll be sent an updated guide every six months. I'll ensure I'm only recommending things to you that are still open, that have up-to-date opening hours and information, and I'll also be adding all of the cool new spots I discovered over the last six months.</p>

<p></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Without People</h2><p></p>
<p>I am
journalist and magazine editor from East Europe but what really makes me tick
is photography. I travel a lot and make all sorts of photos, however I am
especially passionate about a handful of my favorite motives. One of them is the eerie solitude of
empty, abandoned places. Locations that were formerly inhabited or used by
people, but now lie abandoned.</p>
<p>I would like to publish a book of my best photographs of abandoned places from all over the world. Some of them are not abandoned in the strict sense, just dehumanized enough for my taste :-) These are not just your regular ""run of the mill""
abandoned houses - each and every location in the book has a story to tell. Some of these places are easy to get to, some required long preparations, meticulous planning, considerable cost and significant risks.</p>
<p>The
book is under the working title Without People, and it looks like some weird
postscript to human civilization. <strong>It's a great gift for travellers, introverts, loners, zombie afficionados or survival freaks.</strong> It's
incomplete but it looks absolutely great, so far only on my PC though. </p>
<p>Without
People is just the first part of a planned photo book trilogy. The second
book in the series has the working title Expiations: Stairway to Heaven, and it will feature my
favorite photos of religious temples from, well, basically all major (and some
minor) world religions. The third book in the trilogy will be about the sea.
Everybody loves the sea... but to get there I need to make my first two books
successful. </p>
<p>And
for that, I need your help!</p>
<p><b>What I Need and What You Get</b></p>
<p>By streamlining the production process I
managed to cut cost considerably, and can do a beautiful book for a relatively modest sum. I need money to cover the production costs – DTP, proofreading,
printing... I would also like to feature some locations I haven't photographed
yet.</p>
<p><strong>I can't do this without your valuable
contribution. By pledging your support for this project, you get to participate
in what will be a unique photographic document of places and locations
that are changing basically every day, and some of them may be lost forever
sooner than you think.</strong> </p><p>5% of the money I raise I will donate to a local east european animal charity of my choice. </p><p><strong>The book ""Without People"" will feature a selected passage from the book ""Eaarth"" by the famous author, academic and environmentalist Bill McKibben, as the foreword! Many thanks to Bill for the special permission to use his text in the foreword - if you like it, please, buy Eaarth by Bill McKibben on Amazon. <a href=""http://www.billmckibben.com/eaarth/eaarthbook.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.billmckibben.com/eaarth/eaarthbook.html</a></strong></p>
<p>In return for your help you get photographic
prints, books, e-books and.... You can see more details in the
funding options on the right.</p>
<p>Well that's it folks! Thanks for reading, many
MANY thanks for your contribution. Please, contribute, share, like
and do everything else people do on this fine thing called Internet... while
it's still there... you never know when the apocalypse might strike ;-)</p>

The stretch goal for this campaign is.... ta daaam....10.000 USDI will use funds for my NEXT book. IF I reach this goal, everyone, EVERY participant, the OLD and the new ones, will get following perk for free:- Perk ""The Next One"" where you get FREE Digital Copy of my NEXT book - the one about religious temples, with the working title ""Expiations"".I am not going to list this perk in the column to the right, with other perks, because IF I REACH the STRETCH goal the perk will be free for all supporters. So, nothing groundbreaking so far, but I hope these are nice incentives for existing supporters to try to attract new ones, to try to reach the new stretch goal, and for those on the proverbial fence to decide to support the campaign.

Without People
I am
journalist and magazine editor from East Europe but what really makes me tick
is photography. I travel a lot and make all sorts of photos, however I am
especially passionate about a handful of my favorite motives. One of them is the eerie solitude of
empty, abandoned places. Locations that were formerly inhabited or used by
people, but now lie abandoned.
I would like to publish a book of my best photographs of abandoned places from all over the world. Some of them are not abandoned in the strict sense, just dehumanized enough for my taste :-) These are not just your regular ""run of the mill""
abandoned houses - each and every location in the book has a story to tell. Some of these places are easy to get to, some required long preparations, meticulous planning, considerable cost and significant risks.
The
book is under the working title Without People, and it looks like some weird
postscript to human civilization. It's a great gift for travellers, introverts, loners, zombie afficionados or survival freaks. It's
incomplete but it looks absolutely great, so far only on my PC though. 
Without
People is just the first part of a planned photo book trilogy. The second
book in the series has the working title Expiations: Stairway to Heaven, and it will feature my
favorite photos of religious temples from, well, basically all major (and some
minor) world religions. The third book in the trilogy will be about the sea.
Everybody loves the sea... but to get there I need to make my first two books
successful. 
And
for that, I need your help!
What I Need and What You Get
By streamlining the production process I
managed to cut cost considerably, and can do a beautiful book for a relatively modest sum. I need money to cover the production costs – DTP, proofreading,
printing... I would also like to feature some locations I haven't photographed
yet.
I can't do this without your valuable
contribution. By pledging your support for this project, you get to participate
in what will be a unique photographic document of places and locations
that are changing basically every day, and some of them may be lost forever
sooner than you think. 5% of the money I raise I will donate to a local east european animal charity of my choice. The book ""Without People"" will feature a selected passage from the book ""Eaarth"" by the famous author, academic and environmentalist Bill McKibben, as the foreword! Many thanks to Bill for the special permission to use his text in the foreword - if you like it, please, buy Eaarth by Bill McKibben on Amazon. http://www.billmckibben.com/eaarth/eaarthbook.html
In return for your help you get photographic
prints, books, e-books and.... You can see more details in the
funding options on the right.
Well that's it folks! Thanks for reading, many
MANY thanks for your contribution. Please, contribute, share, like
and do everything else people do on this fine thing called Internet... while
it's still there... you never know when the apocalypse might strike ;-)
Check out some of the featured photos below! All photos are subject to change (these are working versions!), and captions are short, just to give you some idea - most captions in the book will be more substantial. Child-sized gas masks in elementary school, Pripyat, Chernobyl zone of exclusionGhost town, Nevada, USASince this is the cover photo for my campaign, I'll leave the proper caption for the book itself ;-) City of the Dead, Cairo, EgyptCasa  Academiei, Bucharest, Romania (and yes, there are actually people in some photos)Spring in full swing in one of the depopulated villages in the Chernobyl Exclusion ZoneNaissaar island, Estonia, former Soviet naval mine factoryFormer NSA listening post, Teufelsberg, Germany

<h3>Feel the Thrill, the Old &amp; Slow Way . . .</h3>
<p>When you find yourself over the hill, it doesn’t automatically mean to slow down. In my case it meant, “<em>go faster</em>”! Turning 50 didn’t suggest I needed to abandon my dream of racing motorcycles – it was the opposite. Racing doesn’t require you to be young, rich, have the best equipment, be the fastest or to win every time. It’s about doing what you love and having the drive and determination to get in the game and be thrilled with just getting to the starting line. It’s about living your dream.</p>
<p>As a kid I raced everywhere I could from Motocross, to hill climbs, to desert races. Over the years I continued to ride, but family and profession consumed most of my time. So when I reached the 50-year mile marker I realized it was time to get serious. Wanting to be the fastest in whatever form of racing I entered. I put together a motorcycle that no one was using for racing and asked my old college friends to join me at the Bonneville Salt Flats. </p>
<p>Since that first race and over the last 8 seasons, the Old and Slow Team has managed to become the “World’s Fastest KLR” while racing for the world land speed record. We took a 93 mph bike and made it go more than 122 mph, very fast for a common dirt bike. With each new racing season, we continue to tweak and modify these bikes with the anticipation of breaking our own records year over year.</p>
<p>World Land Speed Racing is becoming one of the most exciting, most watched and dangerous sports in motorcycle racing. Because we have a very different looking type of motorcycle, the interest we get from fans, spectators and reporters is overwhelming.  We are constantly talking to people or reporters about the bike, showing off the modifications we’ve done and explaining why we race a Kawasaki KLR Enduro bike.  The team’s number two rider, Bob Canestrini of Tooele, Utah; who also has seen 55 in his rear view mirror, is looking to set a land speed record in 2012 on his newly restored and modified 1980 Honda CB750. Being different is good and has helped set us apart as a racing team.</p>
<p>Our mission is to inspire other people to live their dreams. Its never too late, you’re not too old, and you can afford to do it! Last year at Bonneville, a rider told us it had been his dream to race a motorcycle on the Salt Flats and he was inspired when he saw us race.  Finally at the age of 76, he brought his old Triumph out and raced down the white line.  “It made me feel alive again,” he said.</p>
<p>We won’t win every race or set a new record every year, some races we won’t even finish.  As long as we start we’re happy and living our dream. It is very satisfying to know our efforts have had an impact on people and racing in general.  We welcome you to become part of this unique and special team. Help support this fast growing sport and get your brand or business name noticed by performance enthusiasts at these international events. Thank you for your help and support.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Eight years ago this started with one bike and one race. We've added two bikes, and three races since then. We run a lean operation, but four races or more a year with 2-3 bikes the costs can add up. Our sponsors have been great, but the economy has hit them hard as well. They donate parts and equipment when they can. What we need is cash to cover the essentials; entrance fees, transporting, food, lodget and gear. Anything above that helps maintain and repair the bikes. We have the need for speed so we are always looking and new modifications and that costs money.</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>We understand that some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help. Get the word out! Let your family, friends, collegues know about us. Share the request on FaceBook and your email list.</p>

<p>Matt Narel</p></div>","My name is Matt Narel and I am currently going into my senior year at Quinnipiac University. I am an aspiring cyclist and have been working my way up the ranks. Cycling has become my life and its my way to give back to the help others in need.
Over the past few years I have parterned up with Golden Oppurtunities (http://www.goldenopps.org/) who assist with those that battle isolation, depression and loneliness. On August 4,5,11, and 12 I will be holding bike races for all levels of skill and experience. It doesnt matter if you are a first time rider or a seasoned pro, we are all coming out to have a good time and raise money for a great cause. 
100% of the money raised will go straight to Golden Oppurtunities where it will be used to purchase items such as magazines, books, televisions, and help it become more affordable for a caretaker. 
If anyone is in the Tri-state area or would be interested in coming out racing/riding please email me at mvnarel@quinnpiac.edu
This is a great event with photos being taken, t-shirts and other prizes along the way!
If you know anyone who would be interested in either helping our cause or coming out and riding please spread the word
Thank You

There are so many options: gift to yourself or that someone special, or even a group of people. All that’s left is to say thank you for having read this all the way through. Whatever you choose as a reward for your generosity, please share my page with others. Getting the word out far and wide is the only way to make a difference. It might seem absurd, but to make a solo journey around the world you really need a big crew!",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Geek Field Guide is going to Europe!</h3>
<p>We have received enough funding via this Indiegogo campaign and outside sources that we will be proceeding on the project.</p>
<p>Now any additional funding we get lengthens the duration of the trip, and improves our ability to provide more photos and reference material for you.</p>

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What is Geek Field Guide?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>We want to create a comprehensive texture, reference photo, video, audio, and photogrammetry library of locations throughout Europe. </strong></h3>
<p>We will be working with Indiegogo individual backers, game studios and outsource shops, writers, artists, and more to create a massive media library of Europe.</p>
<p>As an example of what we will create for you, we made a two-hour trip to Duke Chapel, in Durham, NC.</p>

<p>We also plan to blog, video blog, provide audio commentaries, and otherwise document the journey from a narrative standpoint for writers and designers.

<h3><strong>How will backers be involved?</strong></h3>
<p>All backers at the $10 or higher level will get access to private forums where we will discuss our itinerary.</p>
<p><strong><em>We do not know which locations we are going to yet. That is up to our backers. (You!) </em></strong></p>
<p>Lower-level backers get to provide requests for where we go. We’ll run polls to see the most popular suggestions and help us decide our route.</p>
<p>Backers at the director or studio levels get a full day of our time (subject to legal, political, safety, and other restrictions. See the FAQ for further details).</p>
<p><strong>What does Geek Field Guide offer that isn’t attainable through a photo texture site?</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of really high-quality texture sites out there. We do not feel that we compete with them, but actually complement their offerings.</p>
<p>They offer a wide variety of art for an equally-diverse number of settings.</p>
<p>We offer focused packages of a region that is documented so that you can know that you are accurately replicating the environment you create (whether for games, writing, art, or any other creative project you work on) with certainty.</p>
<p>Europe is our first destination. We plan to provide our services on-demand in the future.</p>
<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
<p>We looked at the current offerings for content creators, and found that while there are many offerings of high quality texture photos available, we found no evidence of providing a full set of reference materials on demand for specific locations.</p>
<p>We both have a passion for learning and sharing that knowledge with others, whether it is via photography, storytelling, or writing. For a number of years, I have considered a project like this, but the costs to run it properly were prohibitive for a small company. Modern technology allows a team of two to travel across the globe and provide customized information to supporters with rapid iteration and feedback with high fidelity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why video blogs and focus on Adventure in the promotional video?</strong></h3>
<p>There are a lot of things that you miss about an environment by simply taking photos of it.</p>
<p>We could simply write terse, analytical notes about the location, or we could show you and tell you. We decided on a travel documentary format, in the vein of Michael West, would be far more useful to our supporters. By mixing written, video, and audio commentary, we are able to show you what it means to walk down the streets of some ancient place, or engage in a martial art from a first-person perspective. (See the video for a demonstration.)</p>
<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, at 30 frames per second, that’s a lot of words.</p>

</h2><p>The Skillzboard is a versatile tool for rock climbers that provides a portable, weight-bearing solution for <strong>learning, practicing, and teaching rope systems</strong> and anchor techniques in a realistic and safe environment.</p><p> </p><h3>The Problem</h3><p>Rock climbing, especially indoor climbing, has seen an explosion in popularity recently, and the sport’s eventual Olympic debut is likely to make a substantial contribution as well. If you are someone who has never rope climbed outdoors, you may just get the desire to do so at some point (it’s pretty cool). Before you get too excited though, it is important to realize that the safety of yourself and others relies on additional skills that aren't typically learned by climbing indoors.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597624996/uodoqlcr4xtjezkm7kas.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597625124/qxotblyvmjwfqklsovau.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In the past, these skills have typically been passed down by a mentor, but YouTube is definitely a thing, and it’s pretty neat. However, watching a video doesn’t automatically translate to proficiency of a skill without a bit of discipline.

The Skillzboard is a versatile tool for rock climbers that provides a portable, weight-bearing solution for learning, practicing, and teaching rope systems and anchor techniques in a realistic and safe environment. The ProblemRock climbing, especially indoor climbing, has seen an explosion in popularity recently, and the sport’s eventual Olympic debut is likely to make a substantial contribution as well. If you are someone who has never rope climbed outdoors, you may just get the desire to do so at some point (it’s pretty cool). Before you get too excited though, it is important to realize that the safety of yourself and others relies on additional skills that aren't typically learned by climbing indoors.In the past, these skills have typically been passed down by a mentor, but YouTube is definitely a thing, and it’s pretty neat. However, watching a video doesn’t automatically translate to proficiency of a skill without a bit of discipline. Practicing rope systems and anchor techniques is also difficult without being able to access an actual wall equipped with climbing hardware. The SolutionThe Skillzboard simulates a typical bolted anchor found at the top of many climbing routes, and can be fully weighted by the user anywhere from their humble abode to the crag. This realistic experience creates a better learning process and increases retention of knowledge. The Skillzboard is a useful tool for new and experienced climbers alike, and can be used to teach and practice a large variety of skills: cleaning a sport anchor, building a top belay system, escaping the belay, self-rescue methods, big wall techniques, and much more. Mounting CapabilitiesOur patent pending mounting systems allow you to easily set up the Skillzboard in just a minute or two - no tools required! Over-The-DoorIf you own or rent a door, you can practice your technical skills. Using the CHOCKBOARD, simply drape the daisy strap over the door, close the door, and get practicing! Pull-up BarYou can also use your handy-dandy doorway pull-up bar to easily mount the Skillzboard using the daisy strap or a pair of carabiners or quickdraws. Tree / PoleSling a strong, happy tree (or pole) anywhere from your backyard to the crag and get practicing! Just tighten the strap around the trunk, clip the Skillzboard to the daisy loops, and you’re on your way to mastery. VehicleUsing a similar setup to the over-the-door mount, turn your rad vehicle into a mobile practice station! Padded strips on the back protect your windows from scratches. Other Features Got some spare holds lying around? Throw ‘em on the Skillzboard and get stronger! A center jug is also nice for weighting/unweighting your personal anchor.   the CHOCKBOARDDon't let good looks fool you, this sidekick has your back on every step of your training journey. Use the SKILLZBOARD hardware and our Fast Straps to mount over any door and practice anchors from the comfort of the home, or the convenience of your car.  Slots / HolesThis multipurpose accessory helps you hang your SKILLZBOARD from any door, and doubles as a hangboard and pinchblock when you're ready to trade the classroom for the gym. When you're done hitting the books, the CHOCKBOARD easily converts to the strength training tool with surprising versatility.   SustainabilityWe have partnered with a local manufacturer in Wisconsin to make our products.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">~ About the Badger App ~</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Badger uses electronic badges as a reward system for goal-oriented incentives designed by an administrator of their social network - for </span><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">FREE</strong><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. The User Interface makes creating a group, designating point values to badges and their respective tasks for earning those badges, fun and easy! Badger turns everyone into a winner based on their own merit. Share your badges with you friends, brag about it, send positive comments, and grow as an individual or as a community.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>The idea first came from a desire to improve the involvement of high school students in academic and extracurricular activities.  The concept of <em>progressive accomplishment assessment </em>uses electronic based reward systems that are implemented through a mobile application such as the iPhone, Android, or other popular devices.  The concept of reinforcing a student’s achievements through reward based systems is nothing new.  In fact the use of physical trophies to reward children, teens, tweens, and young adults within various organizational structures of academic and extracurricular activities are common practice.  At one point the distribution of trophies were only issued for “winners” (1st, 2nd, or 3rd places), then the perspective on issuing trophies only to selected few were believed to foster negative undertones so then <em>everyone became winners</em>.  </p>
<p>In the Millennia generation trophies are given to all, but that might not be such a bad thing. The Badger is slightly different from awarding the youth for winning or losing, but uses awards as markers of progress towards a greater prize where the definition of <em>the prize </em>is self-generated or by an administrator.  In this case, everyone by definition can still be <em>winners</em> by earning “badges”.  The badges can become useful tools to identify more specific moments of deviation or excelling progress during a journey towards becoming a <em>winner</em> and not just recognize individuals for final outcomes.  The concept attempts to incorporate the stimulation received from trophy-like indicators that measures progress, whether they are physical trophies or electronic badges, as <em>steppingstones</em> for encouraging ritualistic good-behavior driven by an ultimate prize.  </p></span></div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Okay, here's the breakdown.  The production of the application will begin on Monday - 8.18.2014.  The cost of development on the iPhone is priced at $19,500. Thus far the funding has all been through me.  There's nothing like putting my money where my mouth is, and in this case I have and will continue to put about 85%<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> of my pay check into the development of this application.  Not to mention the 60+ hours spent on designing each screen.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I am asking for $30,000.  Below are the different uses of the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Phase 1 is the execution of the application to ensure that it is easy to navigate and intuitive.  The application is estimated to be completed in 16 weeks from the date above.  At the time of this presentation, I have already placed $3,900 to start the application and have a payment plan with the developers at Sunflower Labs LLC of $2,000 every 4 weeks.  (Using math) At this rate, there will be no way I can fund this project alone without delaying the release into the iPhone app store for an additional 16 weeks.  But if that is what it takes then that is what will be done.  At week 16, I will have funded $11,900 myself leaving me with an outstanding balance of $7,600.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">After Phase 1: $30,000 - $7,600 = $22,400.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Phase 2 will be to market the application, build the badge library, and expand onto the iPad ($5,000) and Android phones and tablets ($8,000) to allow all mobile users access to the application.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">After Phase 2: $22,400 - $13,000 =  $9,400.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Phase 3 will include a 3-d printer.  A major part of the business is create a market for electronic badges but to not simply limit it to digital.  The badges that are earned by the user's own merit holds a personal value that symbolizes a step within a journey.  The same joy that is received from holding a trophy, can be brought to life by providing users the option to 3-D print the badges.  Imagine the possibilities and co-creative work that could derive from it!  The remaining $9,400 balance will be used to purchase a 3-D printer and create a foundation for the delivery system to the valued users and cover unexpected costs of running new business.  </span></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>~ Varying Uses ~</h3> <p></p>
<p>The following section will list the various scenarios for the use of the application with varying participant size:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Individual use:</strong></li></ol>
<p>Suppose a user sets up a profile and within it is a section for personal use.  For this example, the goal will be called “Lose Weight/Gain Strength.”  The user designates a badge for every 100 push-ups, another badge for completing 100 sit-ups, and another for completing 50 pull-ups.  For a month, the user honestly awards himself /herself badges based on their performance and the application keeps track and conceptualizes their earnings for tracing and motivational purposes.  At the end of the month, the user sees that they have earned 40 total badges (20 push-badges, 15 sit-up badges, and 5 pull up badges).  The badges translate to a measurable action where in this case within a month’s time, the user performed:</p>
<p>20 badges   x   100 pushups   = 2,000 push-ups</p>
<p>15 badges    x   100 sit-ups   = 1,500 sit-ups</p>
<p>5 badges   x  50 pull-ups   = 250 pull-ups</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of my favorite example that I would use this app for is
exercise.  Everywhere there is a major
push to promote healthy lifestyle by incorporating exercise as part of your
daily routine.  Among your friends you
create a group, and put down the various steps to becoming fit by issuing a
task to a badge, in this case you would earn a badge for completing different
exercises routine that your group decides on. 
The thing that makes it special is when it becomes social. So now, for
every time an individual complete an exercise, everyone in that group will
receive a notification that hey one of their friends just did one of the
exercises.  This could potentially
motivate a minimum of 1 other person to out beat or match that.  And so what could happen is that once 1 other
person competes, others may join and be miles away from each other.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Small groups:</strong></li></ol>
<p>Consider a scenario where a family of parents and their children uses the application.  The parents set up their account then after they set up a group called “Family.”  Within that group are the tasks where for this example, the administrators (the parents) create a goal called “Disney World Trip.”  The application would then prompt the administrators to distinguish how the goal to go to Disney World can be achieved by designating points that are linked to real-life tasks and activities.  Here is the distribution of points:</p>
<ol><li><ol>
<li>Clean Room:    2 points</li>
<li>Practice your Instrument:  3 points</li>
<li>Read a book:  15 points</li>
<li>Get 1 A in the semester:  15 points</li>
<li>Get 2 A’s in the semester:  30 points</li>
<li>Get 3A’s in the semester:  80 points</li>
<li>Get 4 A’s in the semester:  200 points</li>
</ol></li></ol>
<p>In this example, let’s say that in order for the kids to go to Disney World, they must earn 200 accumulated points and the administrator decided that for every 20 points, the group members (in this case the kids), will receive an electronic badge.  This allows for the individual group members to pick and choose how they will achieve the 200 points where one child can do it by cleaning their room 100 times, or receiving straight A’s in the semester or a combination of the in-betweens.  The badges that are awarded mark their progression towards the ultimate prize- <em>“Go to Disney World”.</em></p>

Badger uses electronic badges as a reward system for goal-oriented incentives designed by an administrator of their social network - for FREE. The User Interface makes creating a group, designating point values to badges and their respective tasks for earning those badges, fun and easy! Badger turns everyone into a winner based on their own merit. Share your badges with you friends, brag about it, send positive comments, and grow as an individual or as a community.

The idea first came from a desire to improve the involvement of high school students in academic and extracurricular activities.  The concept of progressive accomplishment assessment uses electronic based reward systems that are implemented through a mobile application such as the iPhone, Android, or other popular devices.  The concept of reinforcing a student’s achievements through reward based systems is nothing new.  In fact the use of physical trophies to reward children, teens, tweens, and young adults within various organizational structures of academic and extracurricular activities are common practice.  At one point the distribution of trophies were only issued for “winners” (1st, 2nd, or 3rd places), then the perspective on issuing trophies only to selected few were believed to foster negative undertones so then everyone became winners.  
In the Millennia generation trophies are given to all, but that might not be such a bad thing. The Badger is slightly different from awarding the youth for winning or losing, but uses awards as markers of progress towards a greater prize where the definition of the prize is self-generated or by an administrator.  In this case, everyone by definition can still be winners by earning “badges”.  The badges can become useful tools to identify more specific moments of deviation or excelling progress during a journey towards becoming a winner and not just recognize individuals for final outcomes.  The concept attempts to incorporate the stimulation received from trophy-like indicators that measures progress, whether they are physical trophies or electronic badges, as steppingstones for encouraging ritualistic good-behavior driven by an ultimate prize.  
   What We Need & What You Get Okay, here's the breakdown.  The production of the application will begin on Monday - 8.18.2014.  The cost of development on the iPhone is priced at $19,500. Thus far the funding has all been through me.  There's nothing like putting my money where my mouth is, and in this case I have and will continue to put about 85% of my pay check into the development of this application.  Not to mention the 60+ hours spent on designing each screen.  
I am asking for $30,000.  Below are the different uses of the funding.
Phase 1 is the execution of the application to ensure that it is easy to navigate and intuitive.  The application is estimated to be completed in 16 weeks from the date above.  At the time of this presentation, I have already placed $3,900 to start the application and have a payment plan with the developers at Sunflower Labs LLC of $2,000 every 4 weeks.  (Using math) At this rate, there will be no way I can fund this project alone without delaying the release into the iPhone app store for an additional 16 weeks.  But if that is what it takes then that is what will be done.  At week 16, I will have funded $11,900 myself leaving me with an outstanding balance of $7,600.  
After Phase 1: $30,000 - $7,600 = $22,400.
Phase 2 will be to market the application, build the badge library, and expand onto the iPad ($5,000) and Android phones and tablets ($8,000) to allow all mobile users access to the application.
After Phase 2: $22,400 - $13,000 =  $9,400.
Phase 3 will include a 3-d printer.  A major part of the business is create a market for electronic badges but to not simply limit it to digital.  The badges that are earned by the user's own merit holds a personal value that symbolizes a step within a journey.  The same joy that is received from holding a trophy, can be brought to life by providing users the option to 3-D print the badges.  Imagine the possibilities and co-creative work that could derive from it!  The remaining $9,400 balance will be used to purchase a 3-D printer and create a foundation for the delivery system to the valued users and cover unexpected costs of running new business.  

  ~ Varying Uses ~ 
The following section will list the various scenarios for the use of the application with varying participant size:
Individual use:
Suppose a user sets up a profile and within it is a section for personal use.  For this example, the goal will be called “Lose Weight/Gain Strength.”  The user designates a badge for every 100 push-ups, another badge for completing 100 sit-ups, and another for completing 50 pull-ups.  For a month, the user honestly awards himself /herself badges based on their performance and the application keeps track and conceptualizes their earnings for tracing and motivational purposes.  At the end of the month, the user sees that they have earned 40 total badges (20 push-badges, 15 sit-up badges, and 5 pull up badges).  The badges translate to a measurable action where in this case within a month’s time, the user performed:
20 badges   x   100 pushups   = 2,000 push-ups
15 badges    x   100 sit-ups   = 1,500 sit-ups
5 badges   x  50 pull-ups   = 250 pull-ups

One of my favorite example that I would use this app for is
exercise.  Everywhere there is a major
push to promote healthy lifestyle by incorporating exercise as part of your
daily routine.  Among your friends you
create a group, and put down the various steps to becoming fit by issuing a
task to a badge, in this case you would earn a badge for completing different
exercises routine that your group decides on. 
The thing that makes it special is when it becomes social. So now, for
every time an individual complete an exercise, everyone in that group will
receive a notification that hey one of their friends just did one of the
exercises.  This could potentially
motivate a minimum of 1 other person to out beat or match that.  And so what could happen is that once 1 other
person competes, others may join and be miles away from each other.
Small groups:
Consider a scenario where a family of parents and their children uses the application.  The parents set up their account then after they set up a group called “Family.”  Within that group are the tasks where for this example, the administrators (the parents) create a goal called “Disney World Trip.”  The application would then prompt the administrators to distinguish how the goal to go to Disney World can be achieved by designating points that are linked to real-life tasks and activities.  Here is the distribution of points:

Clean Room:    2 points
Practice your Instrument:  3 points
Read a book:  15 points
Get 1 A in the semester:  15 points
Get 2 A’s in the semester:  30 points
Get 3A’s in the semester:  80 points
Get 4 A’s in the semester:  200 points

In this example, let’s say that in order for the kids to go to Disney World, they must earn 200 accumulated points and the administrator decided that for every 20 points, the group members (in this case the kids), will receive an electronic badge.  This allows for the individual group members to pick and choose how they will achieve the 200 points where one child can do it by cleaning their room 100 times, or receiving straight A’s in the semester or a combination of the in-betweens.  The badges that are awarded mark their progression towards the ultimate prize- “Go to Disney World”.
Larger groups:
For this example the organization that will represent a large-group scenario will be a Community Service Program in a high school.  At Teaneck High school, a silver sash titled “Community Service Honor” is awarded to graduates that complete a certain number of community service hours in their senior year.  Professional organizations that participate by allowing High School seniors to donate their services and are responsible for signing off on those hours can alternatively use the Badgeus App to designate badges that measure completed service hours.  Teaneck High school can use this system to better control how and where their students complete their community service hours that in many cases take place outside of the school.  Collectively the badges that are awarded mark their progression towards the ultimate prize- “The Silver Sash-Community Service Honor”.  Another example of how the application can be adopted by existing organizations is the boy’s and girl’s scout where the issuance of badges is modernized to an electronic form.
The above example scenarios for the use of the Badgeus App are all different in scope and usage.  This is very important for the success of the application because it must be adaptable for various situations and the users are given customizable freedom to decide their individual or community goals.  The use of electronic badges can help to assess, but are not limited to, academic and extracurricular activities.  It can also be implemented in existing systems simply by having all involved parties download it on their mobile device.  
  Risks & Challenges A major challenge is finding the funding that will help to sustain the growth of the application without putting it to a halt between developments to other devices.  By only supplying the application on the iPhone as it currently stands, can potentially jeopardize the goal to integrate the use of electronic badges in organizations such as schools because simply not everyone has an iPhone.  It limits the social component of the application that would make is successful.  If at the very least I would like to see the application be developed on the Android Mobile phone as soon as the iPhone development is done, or even simultaneously would be awesome!

We've started planning a longboarding mountain/park and we're launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to speed up the process.www.vallumcompany.comBackground: Longboarding PopularityGoogle trends shows Longboarding searches at their highest since 2004, growing at an annual rate of 21% since '08. The NY Times, LA Times, and USA Today have written articles on the growing trend of longboarding as a form of transportation.These boarders hail from across the globe. They skate in their neighborhoods and travel across the globe to skate. They teach others to skate. It's not just transportation, it's also recreation.Snowboarders have mountain. Surfers have surf parks. And there's not one mountain for longboarders−novice and experienced−to skate.
The MountainWe've designed and sketched a mockup of how the Mountain would be laid out−courses, roads, skate store, apparel store, and food. We've designed this based on various commercial real estate in the most popular skate zones−NorCal & SoCal, Tristate, and New England. But we wanted to hear from The Boarders first−where do you want this Mountain?The CrowdfundWe've planned the success of the Vallum Venture right down to how many combinations of boards, tees, hoodies, and Mountain passes we would need to succeed.

<p>Our goal has been to design a highly functional pocket knife that can be carried everywhere you go (except the airport security) without the unnecessary weight and size of a full-sized pocket knife. Additionally, we wanted to design the micro blade to look appealing on your key chain, so you can carry it discreetly and comfortably. </p>
<p><strong>Blade:</strong> The design of the blade is carefully selected to maximize cutting edge area while making it an “all-purpose” pocket knife that is perfect for everyday uses. Drop point blades are the most popular blade shapes on tactical and survival knives. With a strong point that is sharp and controllable, it is a perfect blade shape to have on your key chain every single day to take on any difficult situations, expected or unexpected. </p>

<p><strong>Sizing:</strong> One of the most important factor for us. We wanted a pocket blade that is not too large for everyday carry but not too small for everyday use. As you make a pocket knife smaller, the functional aspect is also diminished. For this reason, we created a perfect balance. At closed position, the blade is only 2.48 inches and in open position, it is 4.1 inches. </p>

<p><strong>Flipper:</strong> The flipper is perfect to initiate the blade opening with very little effort. Additional purpose of this feature is to serve as a hand guard. When closing the blade, it protects the index finger from getting in contact with the sharp blade. Lastly, the flipper design allows you to use as a flat head screwdriver.</p>
<p>Thumb Stud: In addition to the flipper, we added a thumb stud to enhance blade opening. Allows quick one-handed opening of the blade.</p>
<p><strong>Locking Mechanism:</strong> We chose to go with frame lock mechanism because it’s sturdy, reliable and dependable. It uses the strength of the handle/frame to lock the blade in place while minimizing any play. When the blade is fully open, it perfectly SNAPS in place and prevents accidentally closing when in use. With tight tolerance spec and excessive testing, we can ensure there is no wiggle room. </p>

Thanks to its incredible range, large battery, efficient hub wheels, and regenerative braking you’ll never have to worry about running out juice while on a long cruise.

 

Get everywhere you need to go faster than you thought possible with Pomelo Pro’s dual 200W motors and 4 nm of torque.
Pomelo Pro offers multiple riding modes to accommodate any rider no matter their skill, whether you are a beginner, seasoned veteran, or a casual cruiser. 


 

Pomelo Pro’s advanced battery and dual Hub motors let you make easy work of hard hills. Reach speeds of 25km per hour on 17° inclines and hills and never break a sweat again.

 

Built to be long lasting and endure whatever you put it through, Pomelo Pro has a high structural strength thanks to its Fiberglass and Bamboo deck. It has been tested against high compression, temperature, water resistance, and collision to ensure the highest grades of safety.

 


 
 

Go the distance with Pomelo Pro’s 5700mAh easily swappable polymer battery. Its high capacity is guaranteed to last you for any trip or daily commute you need to make.

Fast ChargingIt also is capable of fast charging, meaning you can charge your Pomelo Pro battery to 100% in just 2 hours and be back on the road in no time.
USB ChargerThe battery has a built-in USB output so you can charge your devices on-the-go using your Pomelo Pro as a power bank.

 

Pomelo Pro uses dual changeable Hub motors with 200W of power and 4 nm of torque for quick acceleration and braking. They are also easily interchangeable, so you can swap out the polyurethane tire around your Hub motors when they wear down. 

 

Pomelo Pro uses an intuitive remote trigger so you can control every aspect of your board with one hand. Change the direction, speed, or check the battery with a simple press of a button.

 We aim to make every Pomelo Pro with precision and care. Check out some pics of our workshop where our team is hard-at-work building and testing the electronic longboard with the world’s longest range!

How to keep a perfectly organized luggage and not to forget the essentials for traveling when packing so many different things?Vasco smart packing cubes and bags will allow you to keep your luggage in order and help you quickly find what you need. 7 unique bags with the highest number of valuable features will make your trip incredibly easy.     The Clothes bag lets you compactly pack your clothes in a luggage, which will also help save space in the luggage. There are three bags with different sizes (small, medium, large). The bags have a special design that will keep your clothes from getting wrinkled and will keep your belongings in a perfect condition. Unique compression zippers help reduce space in the luggage by 60%. Your shoes can travel neatly separated from clothes and other things. Special material absorbs odors.Vasco cosmetic's bag compactly encloses personal care products for traveling. Sometimes we do not have enough space to put all the personal care products we take with us, using the hook found on the inside the bag is easy to place even in the smallest bathroom. Waterproof material will keep moisture from getting in and accumulating in the bag.When traveling, we often carry a large number of wires, charging devices, headphones, SIM cards, etc. And they often end up in the same bag and get tangled up. With our Electronics bag you no longer need to worry about how to pack the cables, and you won’t have tangled or torn cables from now on. The cables will be easy to pack, to find and to use. The wallet has a special anti-theft RFID technology. You don't need to search for your ticket, passport or the boarding pass anymore. Now all the travel documents are in one place, and you won’t need to search for them. The bags have a special waterproof fastener that will protect your documents from water and rain. Vasco Laptop SleeveWe use a special soft material that will protect your laptop and add a pocket for notebooks or cables. We always have to remember to take so many things on a trip that sometimes we forget the very important ones: a toothbrush, deodorant, chargers, etc. You won’t have to worry about that anymore: multiple pockets in Vasco bags will remind you to fill them in with travel essentials.We responsibly chose material for Vasco bags and picked a high-quality and durable fabric for each bag that fits its purpose. Our material is waterproof and durable. We chose high-quality, stylish and water resistant fasteners.Our team specializes in design, technology and marketing. We are enthusiasts who love their craft and love to create innovative products that help people simplify, organize and improve their lives. Founder of the company - Artur Stelmakh have launched successful campaign earlier (including Leveraxe - The Smart Axe) and succeeded in get products to Lowe’s and QVC after crowdfunding campaigns, even failed once.We believe that our product will benefit everyone, and we are glad to give you the ability to quickly and easily go on a trip or an unforgettable journey. Enjoy your travels!Risks and challengesWe spent many months working on the origin of the idea and creating the first samples of our products.We have found a partner for the production of our bags, who has more than 20 years of experience working with leading brands.We are already in close contact with the manufacturing plant, and they are fully prepared and are awaiting the start of the production.Our team also has an opportunity to personally verify each shipment to make sure that every customer receives their order without any defects.We have established the entire process and have prepared the team that will handle all the matters upon the end of the project.We are hoping to be able to deliver the products even prior to the deadline.",54.0,0,"5 Campaigns

</center> <h4>What's New and Innovative About Treem Hammock?</h4>
<p>Treem hammock is not an ordinary bridge hammock. It may even need a new classification (let's propose ""tension hammock""). Unlike other bridge hammocks, it is not its shape but tension that gives the hammock flat lay. Shape just improves it further. Treem hammock hangs from 2 trees but has 4 connection point suspension system, which makes it exceptionally stable and impossible to flip over. It's likely the most comfortable hammock for side sleeping and its very small packed size is also unmatched.</p> <h4>The Beginning</h4>
<p>It all started a few years ago when my sister gave me a Brazilian hammock. I wasn’t into hammock camping at that time but I gave it a try. Despite a warm summer and having a 3-season sleeping bag I still felt surprisingly cold by the morning and the sleeping position wasn’t great either (I’m a side sleeper).</p>

 The Future

The very next addition to the hammock will be a bug net because many people have asked for it.I have prototyped a cover that fits and looks really good on the hammock. The bug net will likely look similar to this and will fit to current Treem hammocks.
 

 You can already use a pop up bug net on the hammock, such as ""Catoma Adventure Shelters IBNS (Improved BedNet System)"" or similar.  Why am I doing all this?

<p><strong>                                     We build world's first solar powered family car.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who are we?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>We are the students from Eindhoven University of Technology and we form Solar Team Eindhoven. Eindhoven University of Technology is known for creating some of the newest technologies. Why not use this knowledge and bring our sustainable future a step closer? Last year we decided to form a team with some of the best students from six faculties. We’ve put our studies on a hold for a year to make our dream come true.</p>
<p><img alt=""Team member"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://gallery.mailchimp.com/fb0b6cf9c7b9f4169282f3c07/images/Solar_Team_Eindhoven_groepsfoto_900x600_1_of_1_.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Team members of Solar Team Eindhoven""/></p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Participating in the ‘Cruiser Class’ of the World Solar Challenge 2013®</span></em></strong></p>
<p>To show the capabilities of the car, our team will participate in the famous Australian solar car competition. The organization of this event has launched a new class this year for solar cars that are capable to be used in a practical way. Judgment will be based average speed, number of passengers, energy usage and practicality. In October this yea</p>
<p>r, we’ll meet teams from all over the world to compete on being the best practical solar car.</p>

<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">More than the competition</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Our goal is not only to win the World Solar Challenge 2013®, we really want to take it a step further and bring solar cars to the consumer. That’s why we’re aiming to obtain a license plate and we’ll continue to show the world our concept after the challenge. Visiting the Dutch embassy of Australia, the Singapore International Energy Week, the Electrical Vehicle Exhibition in Barcelona and many secondary schools are already on the program.</p>
<p>In the end, a research will be conducted to investigate the possibilities of up calling the production and bringing the car to the market.

Imagine a car which produces more energy than it uses. How great would it be if it is your car that powers your house? It's possible when you choose for a car powered by nature’s free energy: solar energy.
                                     We build world's first solar powered family car.

Who are we?
We are the students from Eindhoven University of Technology and we form Solar Team Eindhoven. Eindhoven University of Technology is known for creating some of the newest technologies. Why not use this knowledge and bring our sustainable future a step closer? Last year we decided to form a team with some of the best students from six faculties. We’ve put our studies on a hold for a year to make our dream come true.

Participating in the ‘Cruiser Class’ of the World Solar Challenge 2013®
To show the capabilities of the car, our team will participate in the famous Australian solar car competition. The organization of this event has launched a new class this year for solar cars that are capable to be used in a practical way. Judgment will be based average speed, number of passengers, energy usage and practicality. In October this yea
r, we’ll meet teams from all over the world to compete on being the best practical solar car.

More than the competition
Our goal is not only to win the World Solar Challenge 2013®, we really want to take it a step further and bring solar cars to the consumer. That’s why we’re aiming to obtain a license plate and we’ll continue to show the world our concept after the challenge. Visiting the Dutch embassy of Australia, the Singapore International Energy Week, the Electrical Vehicle Exhibition in Barcelona and many secondary schools are already on the program.
In the end, a research will be conducted to investigate the possibilities of up calling the production and bringing the car to the market. You can already start thinking about what to do with your car. Why not connecting the car to your house and provide it with electricity? Or what about delivering electricity to malls when parked instead of paying for your parking spot? 
Your support is crucial
We want to give you the opportunity to contribute to the creation of this incredible car. With your help we’ll be able to buy the solar panels which will be mounted on the roof of the car and provide us with energy. These panels really are the heart of the car, and you can make it happen!
Let’s do it together

<p>I figured I'd give this route a chance to see I can get the finances together to buy a bike outright for myself.

<p>Here is my pitch, Look at it as a tax write off or a donation to a good cause. I have spent the last 2 years as a behavioral health specialist in the Army and will be heading back out again to do the job that I love for 1 more year, helping soldiers find a way back home from injuries that can't be seen. Mental trauma for these men and women who have volunteered to serve our country is still going untreated or undiagnosed. I have seen first hand the destruction it can have on relationships and military careers. Sometimes its draining and stressful to do what I do, but I do believe I was put on this earth to help. For me, a motorcycle would be an amazing stress relief for the days I have to absorb alot of bad energy and help my battle buddies sort through the fog that is civilian life.</p>
<p>My goal is 10K so that I can buy something nice and hopefully have enough left over for taxes, tags, title and riding equipment.</p>

So much so, that he once received a message from his favorite airline, stating: “Congratulations! You have more flying hours than our pilots!!!”</p><p>But, with having a family, he faced a hard task. How could he feel closer to his children and elderly mother, while also keeping an eye on his belongings and the mischievous pets back at home? And how could his wife feel safer when she was at home alone with the children?</p><p>He started by buying several webcams to connect at home, but the router configuration, DDNS problems and invasive firewalls were always so troublesome.</p><p>When he discussed his troubles with Link Union IT Designer, the idea was born. Why not create a hybrid SmartCam by combining 3G-4G technology with an internal battery to solve any connectivity problems?</p><p>So link-U was born, and a design team was created in San Jose, California.</p><p>Taiwan-based technical partner guaranteed the feasibility of the project, and now link-U needs your support to reach production.</p><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>We need your help to bring link-U to the world</strong></h3><p>We love link-U and have worked hard to make a working prototype. We’ve put countless development and testing hours into link-U’s software. To make it available to everyone for a reasonable price, we need your contribution. Help us reach our goal and bring the link-U Hybrid SmartCam to the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/900782/files/20141003022854-line.jpg?1412328534"" src=""""/> </p><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p> </p><h2> </h2><p><b>Do I need to setup my router and firewall to connect link-U with my smartphone?</b></p><p>No. Thanks to its Hybrid configuration, link-U can find the best way to establish the connection between itself and your mobile device automatically.</p><p><b>Where are my video files stored? Is my privacy safe?</b></p><p>We take storage and privacy very seriously. That’s why we created link-U to store and encrypt all data in its internal memory, so you are the only one who can access its files. Nothing is stored on our servers. </p><p><b>Does link-U consume a lot of data on my 3G/4G plan?</b></p><p>link-U will try to use your LAN to send data to mobile devices. If LAN is unavailable, it will switch to its 3G/4G internal modem. Data consumption is very low in down streaming and it will only consume the data necessary for pinging your request. </p><p><b>Will one or several link-U Hybrid SmartCams in the same home consume a lot of bandwidth on my LAN?</b></p><p>No, all video data is stored in the internal SD memory card, and video streaming will be launched only when required by the user from a mobile device.</p><p><b>Can I easily move my link-U from one place to another?</b></p><p>link-U has an internal battery and an internal 3G/4G modem, so it can work anywhere with or without power, and with or without LAN or Wi-Fi for approximately 8 hours.</p><p><b>Can link-U work without the 3G/4G connection or without a SIM card?</b></p><p>Yes, but then you need to properly setup your router and firewall configurations in the same way you would for most other webcams and home monitoring devices.</p><p><b>What kind of Bluetooth Smart home devices will my link-U connect to?</b></p><p>We are compiling a list of them, but basically all the BTLE devices which run in an ON-OFF environment are compatible. For example gas or fire detectors, sirens, windows intrusion sensors, door or garage remote locks, lighting fixtures and switches are all compatible. More complex devices like thermostats are not compatible right now, but we will work hard to make them compatible in a future App upgrade.</p><p><b>Can link-U accept several smartphone logins? Can one smartphone access several link-U Hybrid SmartCams?</b></p><p>Yes, both are possible up to 10.</p><p><b>When will link-U be available?</b></p><p>October 2015.</p><p><b>Does link-U setup require a computer?</b></p><p>No, the App installed on your mobile device gives you access to all configuration settings.</p><p><b>Is link-U compatible with Android?</b></p><p>Yes, link-U works with both Android and Apple<b> </b>iOS mobile devices.</p><p><b>Do I need to set up a DDNS service?</b></p><p>No, link-U will use the 3G/4G modem to define the proper IP address, then switch to LAN. Your link-U is ready to use from the second you open the box; just set a data SIM card inside the bay and you're ready to go.</p><p> </p><p><b>Does link-U allows for different mounting positions?</b></p><p>The round base is screwed to the link-U with a standard camera screw. This makes it easy for to customize a mounting position with any standard camera mounting arm.</p><p><b>What is the video sensor's definition?</b></p><p>The link-U<b> </b>video sensor  has a resolution <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> up to 1920x1080 at 30fps.</span></p><p><b>How good is the quality of link-U night vision?</b></p><p> </p><p>link-U has  LED Infrared (IR) night vision , so  you can see up  to a guaranteed 25 feet (8 meters).

With traditional IP cameras, you must have a PC, and you have to know how to configure DDNS, Ports and Firewalls. Or you have to pay big bucks for costly installations. Not anymore!      No PC required. With 3G/4G or Wi-Fi Connects Directly to Your Mobile DevicesWith link-U there’s no need to connect to a PC. Instead, link-U connects directly to your smartphone or mobile device via its built-in 3G/4G cellular modem or Wi-Fi. Thanks to this flexible ‘hybrid’ configuration, link-U finds the best way to establish the connection between itself and your mobile device automatically.    
       Why it’s different.  Link-U makes sure you are always in touch, even when you move link-U to another location. Move it upstairs or downstairs, take it outdoors, to your motorhome, to the park, to the pool… anywhere you want to monitor! And link-U comes with two sources of power: standard Power over Ethernet (PoE), and a backup 8-hour battery — so link-U is available even when the power goes out.   Remote Control from IPhone and Android Use the link-U mobile app to control up to ten link-U devices from your iOS or Android smartphone or mobile device. Receive alerts, connect to your home, interact with people remotely (video chat), or retrieve past events recorded in the internal memory. Using the link-U app is simple. Set the ‘events’ that should trigger the sensor to start automatic video recording, and the alerts you want to receive. When you receive an alert, use link-U to see what triggered the sensors. You can access video recorded at the time of any event. Or you can check on what is happening live, with full control over the video camera, including pan and zoom. On board speakers and an internal microphone allow you to video chat with people right through the link-U app.        Bluetooth Smart Hub. Control Your Other Smart Home Devices Link-U includes a Bluetooth Smart hub that allows you to remotely monitor and control up to ten Bluetooth Smart Home devices, directly from the app interface installed on your smartphone.

     Our story
 Andy is link-U’s founder, and he is always traveling for business. So much so, that he once received a message from his favorite airline, stating: “Congratulations! You have more flying hours than our pilots!!!”But, with having a family, he faced a hard task. How could he feel closer to his children and elderly mother, while also keeping an eye on his belongings and the mischievous pets back at home? And how could his wife feel safer when she was at home alone with the children?He started by buying several webcams to connect at home, but the router configuration, DDNS problems and invasive firewalls were always so troublesome.When he discussed his troubles with Link Union IT Designer, the idea was born. Why not create a hybrid SmartCam by combining 3G-4G technology with an internal battery to solve any connectivity problems?So link-U was born, and a design team was created in San Jose, California.Taiwan-based technical partner guaranteed the feasibility of the project, and now link-U needs your support to reach production.  We need your help to bring link-U to the worldWe love link-U and have worked hard to make a working prototype. We’ve put countless development and testing hours into link-U’s software. To make it available to everyone for a reasonable price, we need your contribution. Help us reach our goal and bring the link-U Hybrid SmartCam to the world.    FAQ  Do I need to setup my router and firewall to connect link-U with my smartphone?No. Thanks to its Hybrid configuration, link-U can find the best way to establish the connection between itself and your mobile device automatically.Where are my video files stored? Is my privacy safe?We take storage and privacy very seriously. That’s why we created link-U to store and encrypt all data in its internal memory, so you are the only one who can access its files. Nothing is stored on our servers. Does link-U consume a lot of data on my 3G/4G plan?link-U will try to use your LAN to send data to mobile devices. If LAN is unavailable, it will switch to its 3G/4G internal modem. Data consumption is very low in down streaming and it will only consume the data necessary for pinging your request. Will one or several link-U Hybrid SmartCams in the same home consume a lot of bandwidth on my LAN?No, all video data is stored in the internal SD memory card, and video streaming will be launched only when required by the user from a mobile device.Can I easily move my link-U from one place to another?link-U has an internal battery and an internal 3G/4G modem, so it can work anywhere with or without power, and with or without LAN or Wi-Fi for approximately 8 hours.Can link-U work without the 3G/4G connection or without a SIM card?Yes, but then you need to properly setup your router and firewall configurations in the same way you would for most other webcams and home monitoring devices.What kind of Bluetooth Smart home devices will my link-U connect to?We are compiling a list of them, but basically all the BTLE devices which run in an ON-OFF environment are compatible. For example gas or fire detectors, sirens, windows intrusion sensors, door or garage remote locks, lighting fixtures and switches are all compatible. More complex devices like thermostats are not compatible right now, but we will work hard to make them compatible in a future App upgrade.Can link-U accept several smartphone logins? Can one smartphone access several link-U Hybrid SmartCams?Yes, both are possible up to 10.When will link-U be available?October 2015.Does link-U setup require a computer?No, the App installed on your mobile device gives you access to all configuration settings.Is link-U compatible with Android?Yes, link-U works with both Android and Apple iOS mobile devices.Do I need to set up a DDNS service?No, link-U will use the 3G/4G modem to define the proper IP address, then switch to LAN. Your link-U is ready to use from the second you open the box; just set a data SIM card inside the bay and you're ready to go. Does link-U allows for different mounting positions?The round base is screwed to the link-U with a standard camera screw. This makes it easy for to customize a mounting position with any standard camera mounting arm.What is the video sensor's definition?The link-U video sensor  has a resolution  up to 1920x1080 at 30fps.How good is the quality of link-U night vision? link-U has  LED Infrared (IR) night vision , so  you can see up  to a guaranteed 25 feet (8 meters). Image quality is pretty awesome (we are using a new type of LED IR which is really powerful), but please note that in most cases, final video quality is mainly related to connection  strength more than the video sensor’s capability. Does the 130 degree lens creates distortion? The level of distortion is related to distance. Objects very near the lens will be  slightly distorted, but from a distance of 4 feet or more, distortion is unnoticeable.Does my link-U come with a power adaptor? How many devices can it support?link-U come with a PoE injector of 24W which can power one unit only. If you use power from a standard PoE Hub, each port can serve only one link-U unit (PoE standard  IEEE 802.3at).Can I record the video streaming directly to a computer or a video recorder server?At this moment link-U can only record to its internal SD card memory only. One of the key-design points from the beginning was to avoid any LAN bandwidth occupation.Can I install link-U outside? No, link-U is not IP-66 rated, so it cannot be installed outside and should not come in contact with water. Of course its 4G internal modem and back-up battery allow you to use it outside for a limited time (up to 8 hours) and in normal weather conditions.    We need your help to bring link-U to the worldWe love link-U and have worked hard to make a working prototype. Now we need your help to make it available to everyone for a reasonable price.

<p>Hi! My name is Nolan Baker and I'm in the eighth grade at Edvisons Off Campus and I have been offered an opportunity to travel to London for 10 days in March as part of a school trip to study the art and history of this large city. I will be traveling with 18 other students and I'm excited to learn the history as I experience the city firsthand! We will spend the entire time in the city of London visiting  Windsor and Stonehenge. I think this trip will be a great experience for me as I get ready to enter high school next year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $1,500 to cover travel, supplies and meals.  I know that you will want to see how your donation is contributing to my trip so every donor will get access to a Vimeo link where I will be uploading pictures from my travels so you can see the sights and follow along.  Donations of any amount are welcome and greatly appreciated.  For a $25 donation, you will receive an original linoleum print there are twenty of these items that you can claim by donating. For those that can contribute $75, you will receive one of four framed photos from the trip and for the first donor to contribute $100 or more will receive a one of a kind framed original sketch of one of the places we are going to visit in London.  It would be really helpful if you could share the link so I can get the word out and reach my goal. </p>

What is goTele?   goTele is an off-grid outdoor tracking device specifically for outdoor enthusiasts and their friends, families, and pets to experience safe and exciting adventures. Everyone can check all (at most 30) group members' real-time positions and trajectories in one map, communicate with each other by sending SMS texts, send SOS signals in an emergency, etc – all without using any smartphone service and data! goTele was developed and continuously optimized by our hard-working R&D team who has been spending countless days and nights working on its unique DS-SS technology since 2013.When to Use goTele？Besides common outdoor activities, goTele can also be widely used in the following scenarios:*Skiing and Snowboarding*Camping, Hiking and Hunting*Children and Pets Supervision*International Travels or Family Vacations*Team Activities, e.g. Road Trips*Outdoor Games, Cross Country Races, Cycling, Motorcycling*Festivals and Concerts*Emergency, Rescue and Disaster Relief*Boy/Girl Scouts Acitivies*Water Sports, e.g. Kayaking, RaftingHow Does goTele Work? Mesh and Our Core DS-SS TechnologyMesh requires fixed team formations to support its transmission network, therefore it is only suitable for military use. However, team formation is random in outdoor activities, making it difficult to form an effective Mesh transmission network; people always lose connection with each other even when they are apart in short distances. In addition, Mesh's high power consumption and short continuous working time proves that it is not the best choice for outdoor activities.In order to improve all these defects, goTele adopts revolutionary DS-SS technology because of its advantages in low power consumption, strong anti-interference ability, and high sensitivity of receiving signals. goTele's transmission distance is enhanced by 5 times, which is 3-5 times stronger than Mesh's. 1W of goTele's transmission distance is equivalent to 5W of a walkie-talkie. Furthermore, goTele has a unique communication protocol, which can easily support networking of up to 30 users.Independent Built-in GPS ModuleAfter a year of outdoor testing and intensive research, we decided to build a cutting-edge GPS module with the highest precision into goTele despite its high cost.goTele effectively tracks your position stably and continuously under any troublesome and emergent situation. It saves on smartphone power consumed by GPS positioning and greatly improves team safety in outdoor adventures, furthermore, the precision is higher than GPS inside the phone.Main FeaturesAll thoughtful functions of goTele are deliberately designed for the easiest and most convenient operation for your outdoor adventures, and we will introduce the main features for you as follows.Real-time TrackinggoTele app enables you to view and compare real-time locations and trajectories of all 30 teammates directly in the same map without sending requests to each other. Whether you’re watching the personalized avatar icon of your friends in the map during your trip or reviewing the saved trajectories record after trip, you’ll feel goTele rather interesting, and it can really bring more fun and happy memory for your trip.SOSOne SOS button is specifically designed on goTele device to enable its owner in trouble to send out SOS signals and real-time location to your teammates in case of emergencies (e.g. smartphone lost or with no power).Geo-FenceThe Geo-Fence function lets you monitor and protect your loved ones by simply setting a safety distance in the app (100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 meters). When the goTele device is carried by your kids or pets, the app will alert you once they exceed the safety distance.Off-line MapgoTele provides the free using and downloading of the top 5 common high-definition off-line maps, which includes Google Satellite, Google Map, Google Relief, Open Cycle and Open Street.MessageYou can send messages, emojis, and real-time locations to your group members even when your smartphone is out of service. It makes sure that each group member gets connected at any time under any situation.Three ProofingsgoTele is a high-quality product that is designed with 3 types of protection.

<b>- Is the helmet crash certified?</b> - Yes. The T1 and T2 are CPSC and CE certified and will become AS/NZS certified once funding has completed. This makes the helmet safe for use in North America and South America, Europe, and soon to be ready for Australia and New Zealand. </div>
<div>
<b>- Are the lights bright enough to light my path? </b>- No. The lights of the T1 and T2 are meant to make the rider visible to motor traffic, not to light the road way. The lights are visible from all angles and large enough to draw attention to the rider in order to prevent collisions with motorists. The lights are however, bright enough to light reflective signs, a map or be useful when changing a flat tire in the dark. </div>
<div>

Some 1500 people sought medical care, and 7200 buildings were damaged. If the asteroid had entered the atmosphere at a higher angle, many people would probably have died.</p><p>Many asteroids (Near Earth Objects or NEOs) are in orbits around the Sun that bring them very close to Earth. Many have hit the Earth in the past, and continue to do so. Even small NEOs can pose a threat to your life and our civilization.</p><p>Congress has not provided the funding to build enough telescopes to track all the NEOs discovered; we will help address this issue with your help. Using funds raised through this campaign, we will purchase a telescope and camera to follow NEOs after discovery. Every clear, dark night, we will use this telescope to track NEOs and report our data to the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, MA, which computes orbits and determines if an NEO will hit Earth, along with its colleagues at NASA/JPL and Italy. We have an experienced team in place and a committee of project advisors with the talent and expertise to ensure success.</p><p>Our goal is to make life safer for you -- and all of us! Let's not go the way of the dinosaurs, which were probably wiped out by an impact from an asteroid only a few miles across.</p><p>Note: Some photos below have a link to a larger, more detailed version indicated by a blue caption.

</ul><h3>Project Description</h3><p><i><b>1.	Why Should We Track Near Earth Objects (NEOs)?</b></i></p><p><i><b>According to some estimates, you have about the same chance of dying from an asteroid hitting the Earth as you have in dying in an airplane crash! This could impact YOU and your family's future.</b></i></p><p>Each year, Congress gives $15 Billion to the FAA to keep airline travel safe, and more to the Dept. of Homeland Security to prevent airline terrorism. But Congress gave NASA only $30 Million last year and about $4 Million per year for the last decade to fulfill Congress’s mandate to NASA to discover and track Near Earth Objects or NEOs, asteroids and comets whose orbits around the Sun bring them close to Earth. This is barely enough to fund the professional surveys, and insufficient to build a new telescope to track the fainter NEOs that Congress has mandated NASA to discover and follow.</p><p>The Winer Observatory in southeastern Arizona has teamed with faculty members in two departments of Texas A&amp;M University to build a telescope to help keep track of these NEOs, especially the ones posing the greatest threat to Earth. We have no formal agreement with Texas A&amp;M yet; first, we need to raise enough money to get the project under way before agreeing on who does what in a partnership.</p><p>The problem with getting Congress to fund NEO discovery and tracking at a level appropriate to the risk is that asteroid impacts on Earth are rare. This makes people think the risk of dying from an NEO impact is lower than it is. This is an example of a low probability but high consequence event -- something that human nature prevents us from taking seriously enough.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322074/files/20140121132950-moon-small.jpg?1390339790"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/moon-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fig 1: Image of Moon showing impact craters</i></a><br/><p></p><p></p><p>A glance at the Moon shows hundreds of impact craters.

If it did, we would not be appealing to the general public for funds.</p><p>Large corporations use risk management experts to alert senior management to things they should do to protect their organizations from threats. Members of this risk management community have declared NEOs a <i>moderate</i>, not low, risk worthy of increased funding.</p><p>If we are able to track both the new discoveries and those that have made one or more orbits around the Sun, our team may be able to give NASA sufficient early warning that they can launch a space mission to move the asteroid away from its collision path from Earth.</p><p>There are several ways NASA could do this, for example: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(a) a space tug using gravity to pull the asteroid just enough to divert it from Earth, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(b) nuclear weapons to create jets of matter to propel the asteroid off its collision course, or (c) nuclear weapons to disintegrate the asteroid into small enough pieces that they pose no further harm. This requires long-term tracking of the asteroid, to ensure we know its orbit well enough that we are sure it poses a threat, and to give us sufficient time to act. It takes years to design a new space mission, and a year or more to reach the NEO after the mission is launched from Earth. The larger the telescope we can purchase, the more time we will have to save ourselves.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are part of a small community dedicated to tracking NEOs after the surveys discover them. As the surveys discover the larger ones (one estimate is that 96% of all NEOs a kilometer across and larger have been discovered, and none threaten Earth for the next century), it becomes harder to keep track of the smaller ones. We are hoping to add to the existing resources a telescope optimized for NEO tracking of </span>sufficient<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> size to improve our ability to weed out the NEOs that pose no threat and to focus on the ones that do.</span></p><p><i><b>2. Why Should We Build a New Telescope Now?</b></i></p><p>Professional surveys are very efficient at discovering new Near Earth Objects (NEOs). The Catalina Sky Survey (one of two of their telescopes is shown below) located north of Tucson in the Catalina Mountains, discovers up to 2/3 of all new NEOs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327809/files/20140124140624-CSS-60-small.jpg?1390601184"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/CSS-60-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i></i></a><i><a href="""" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/CSS-60-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fig 8: Catalina Sky Survey 60-inch telescope, which discovers up to 70% of all new NEOs</a></i><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What the discovery surveys often do not usually have are the telescopes and staff to continue observing their new discoveries to reduce the errors in their orbits. What is lacking is telescopes to track newly discovered NEOs months after initial discovery to reduce the errors in their orbits. Far too often, we don't know which NEOs pose a serious threat and deserve our attention, and which we can safely ignore. That is the problem your generous donation will help solve.</span></p><p>Discovery usually occurs when the NEO is at its brightest, when the Sun, Earth, and NEO are in nearly a straight line. Within days to weeks, the NEO dims rapidly. The errors in the initial discovery points on the sky are large enough to allow thousands or even a million different orbits to be fit to the data points. By observing the NEOs months later, the NEO is further along in its orbit about the Sun, and our observations then reduce the errors.</p><p>All of the hundreds of NEOs we have observed usually start out with large errors, sometimes with a possible orbit that makes it hit the Earth. Our observations reduce these errors, and limit the number of possible orbits you can draw through all the data points, often removing an NEO from the list of those that could strike the Earth.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327816/files/20140124141402-KPNO-2m-small.jpg?1390601642"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/KPNO-2m-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fig 9: US national observatory 84-inch telescope, due to be closed August 2014</i></a><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our situation is that the telescope we use at the US national observatory pictured above will be closed August 1, 2014. The US astronomy community wants to build some very large and expensive telescopes to probe the fundamental nature of the universe (but will not be useful for our purpose), and we fully support these projects. But Congress has not given the National Science Foundation enough money to both build these new telescopes and to keep the ones we use open.</span></p><p>If our project is fully funded, we will purchase a telescope that will help us to pay attention to the NEOs that are the most dangerous.</p><p><i><b>3.	Why Isn't the Government Doing This?</b></i></p><p>The two major funding agencies for astronomy and planetary science are the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA. The NSF operates a variety of national and international facilities and awards research grants to individual scientists, but funds astronomy programs with a focus outside the solar system. Congress amended the ""<i>National Aeronautics and </i><i>Space Act of 1958</i>,"" Public Law #85-568, 72 Stat., 426 to include discovering and tracking of NEOs as a fundamental NASA mission.</p><p>Congress appropriates a small amount each year for this purpose, and NASA wisely uses it to upgrade existing telescopes and to support the building of new ones. However, the current NASA budget is insufficient to build the number of new telescopes dedicated to tracking NEOs that we need. As part of its recent budget cutting, Congress reduced the budgets of both the NSF and NASA, making funding of this telescope using Federal funds impossible. Although the funding of NASA's NEO Observation program has increased recently, they still do not have the funds necessary to build telescopes capable of finding all the targets Congress has mandated that they find.</p><p>So the federal government does not have the money to support our program. We now turn to the general public, you, who will be most affected if an asteroid hits the Earth to fund the telescope we need to continue this important work.</p><p><br/><i><b>4.

Our goal is to procure a telescope and camera to be placed at Winer's site in southeastern Arizona, where the weather provides over 200 clear nights per year. Most of the group members plan to use their time on the telescope to work with their students to improve the orbits of Near Earth Objects (NEOs), asteroids or comets whose orbits about the Sun bring them very close to (or in collision with) the Earth. Other students will be involved in the design and construction of the camera and possibly the telescope itself, and in using the telescope for a variety of projects during the part of the month that the Moon makes the sky too bright to see faint NEOs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327844/files/20140124142736-MT-2m-small.jpg?1390602456"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/Mark-2m-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><p></p><a href=""http://www.projectasteroid.org/CF/MT-2m-large.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fig 10: Project Manager Mark Trueblood, Director of Winer Observatory, at the controls of the US national observatory 84-inch telescope</i></a><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mark Trueblood holds a BS in physics from Brown University and an MS in astronomy from the University of Maryland. Early in his career, he worked in the aerospace industry near Washington, DC where among other assignments, he was the Program Manager for the contract to build the original Hubble Space Telescope control center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. After moving to Tucson, AZ in 1990 after Hubble was launched, he worked for the US national observatory for 22 years, first as a programmer in charge of developing a large database for the National Solar Observatory, then for 18 years overseeing instrument development for the two Gemini Observatory 8-meter (320-inch) telescopes and for the national observatory’s two 4-meter (160-inch) telescopes. These instrument projects ranged in value from $4 million to $30 million, so he knows how to manage both large and small projects.</span></p><p>Since 2008, he has led a team to track and measure NEOs, first at Winer Observatory, then by competing with other astronomers to use national observatory telescopes on Kitt Peak. His team has consistently received high scores from outside review committees, sometimes receiving more nights than requested. The result is 90 publications covering 264 individual NEOs the team has tracked. Trueblood received two NASA grants to support his team’s NEO observations.

Reducing orbit errors means we can ignore the NEOs that pose no threat to Earth, and focus on the ones that might hit the Earth.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If we do not reach our goal, we will evaluate what funds we do receive and consult with our partners and advisors to determine how best to use the funds.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">No matter what size telescope we are able to buy, the observing technique is the same.

Each month, the surveys discover dozens or even 100 new NEOs, but about 20% (mostly the fainter ones) are not re-observed after discovery well enough to get an accurate orbit. For practical purposes, they cannot be recovered in the future unless just by luck a survey re-discovers them. That means we do not know their orbits well enough to know whether or not they will hit the Earth.</p><p>Our telescope will be imaging NEOs every clear night when the Moon does not interfere by lighting up the sky. We will be keeping track of the newly discovered objects and tracking them to reduce errors in our understanding of their orbits. We will diligently report our measurements to the Minor Planet Center so that everyone in the NEO community can make use of our observations. With your help, we will provide that ""collision insurance"" for the Earth.</p><p>Since our telescope will be used for educating students as well as tracking NEOs, on nights too bright (when the moon lights up the sky) to work on NEOs, we will schedule student observations of variable stars, stars that might have planets going around them, and other objects of interest. This is the educational part of our project.</p><p>People are interested in many things: training for the Olympics, finding a cure for cancer, the activities of Hollywood stars, their own family and friends, and so on.

<li>If you want a digital image of a celestial object (at a qualifying backer level), just give us the name of the object by email after the campaign ends. Or specify the celestial coordinates. We will figure out the exposure time, what time of year to observe your object, etc. We will take the image and email it to you.</li>
<li>When taking pictures using our telescope, please remember that as a ground-based observatory, we are subject to the weather. Our location provides a large number of clear nights each year, but we have a summer monsoon season July through September when we close down to prevent lightning damage. If the weather louses up your photo, we will reschedule it for a later time, with the date depending on demand and your donation level. Professional astronomers do not get this service -- if they are clouded out, they are out of luck and have to submit another proposal for a time when their target is visible. And the second time around, they might not get the time they request. For our project, you will get your time.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to schedule your image on our public outreach 14-inch telescope. First, it may be better suited to what you want to photograph (if you want a photo of Mars, you probably do not want a tiny dot in the middle of a large picture of zillions of stars). Second, it can take 2 to 4 years to purchase and install a new telescope, as most of the telescopes the size we wish to purchase are custom designed and built after the order is received. We want to get you the reward you are due as quickly as possible, but we also want to make it as high quality as possible.</li>
<li>Some objects are very faint. If you choose a contribution level with only a few minutes of time, if we believe you could not get a good image in the time available, we will let you know, so that you can either change your contribution or change your target. The Moon can be imaged in about a second, planets can be imaged in a few minutes, while galaxies tend to take a half hour or more.</li>
<li>Not all celestial objects are visible every night of the year. As the Earth goes around the Sun, different parts of the sky become visible in different seasons. For example, the constellation Orion is visible in the early evening during northern hemisphere winter, but at different times during the night or not at all in other seasons. We will attempt to give each donor personalized service in scheduling their telescope time.</li>

<p></p></div>","Quick OverviewJust a year ago, a city of 1 million people in Russia had an asteroid cause injury and destruction. Some 1500 people sought medical care, and 7200 buildings were damaged. If the asteroid had entered the atmosphere at a higher angle, many people would probably have died.Many asteroids (Near Earth Objects or NEOs) are in orbits around the Sun that bring them very close to Earth. Many have hit the Earth in the past, and continue to do so. Even small NEOs can pose a threat to your life and our civilization.Congress has not provided the funding to build enough telescopes to track all the NEOs discovered; we will help address this issue with your help. Using funds raised through this campaign, we will purchase a telescope and camera to follow NEOs after discovery. Every clear, dark night, we will use this telescope to track NEOs and report our data to the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge, MA, which computes orbits and determines if an NEO will hit Earth, along with its colleagues at NASA/JPL and Italy. We have an experienced team in place and a committee of project advisors with the talent and expertise to ensure success.Our goal is to make life safer for you -- and all of us! Let's not go the way of the dinosaurs, which were probably wiped out by an impact from an asteroid only a few miles across.Note: Some photos below have a link to a larger, more detailed version indicated by a blue caption.

Project Description1.	Why Should We Track Near Earth Objects (NEOs)?According to some estimates, you have about the same chance of dying from an asteroid hitting the Earth as you have in dying in an airplane crash! This could impact YOU and your family's future.Each year, Congress gives $15 Billion to the FAA to keep airline travel safe, and more to the Dept. of Homeland Security to prevent airline terrorism. But Congress gave NASA only $30 Million last year and about $4 Million per year for the last decade to fulfill Congress’s mandate to NASA to discover and track Near Earth Objects or NEOs, asteroids and comets whose orbits around the Sun bring them close to Earth. This is barely enough to fund the professional surveys, and insufficient to build a new telescope to track the fainter NEOs that Congress has mandated NASA to discover and follow.The Winer Observatory in southeastern Arizona has teamed with faculty members in two departments of Texas A&M University to build a telescope to help keep track of these NEOs, especially the ones posing the greatest threat to Earth. We have no formal agreement with Texas A&M yet; first, we need to raise enough money to get the project under way before agreeing on who does what in a partnership.The problem with getting Congress to fund NEO discovery and tracking at a level appropriate to the risk is that asteroid impacts on Earth are rare. This makes people think the risk of dying from an NEO impact is lower than it is. This is an example of a low probability but high consequence event -- something that human nature prevents us from taking seriously enough.Fig 1: Image of Moon showing impact cratersA glance at the Moon shows hundreds of impact craters. Earth would look the same way, except 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, and Earth's surface is constantly changing, due to earthquakes and erosion. It was not until Earth survey satellites were launched that we found many craters that were right there under our noses.Fig 2: Barringer Crater caused by impact from a 60 foot NEO about 50,000 years ago, recent by geologic standardsMost of the craters seen on the Moon (and Earth) were formed by impacts by asteroids and comets millions or billions of years ago, though several are more recent. One of the most recent was in 1908, when a large meteor exploded over the Stony Tunguska River in Russia. Fortunately, the affected area was largely unoccupied by people, but 80 million trees were flattened over an area of 830 square miles. The explosion is rated at about 10-15 megatons, 1000 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan in World War II.Fig 3: Tunguska event in 1908, felling trees over 100s of square milesAbout a year ago in a single day, February 15, 2013, Earth had two warning shots across the bow. One was a previously discovered NEO, 2012 DA14, which is about 100 feet across. It flew between Earth and our communications satellites that are located about 1/10 the distance from Earth to the Moon. A second NEO we didn't know existed, about 60-feet across (small by NEO standards) exploded 20 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, sending 1500 people to seek medical help and damaging over 7200 buildings.Fig 4: Chelyabinsk, Russia event on February 15, 2013A video of the Chelyabinsk event, compiled from car dashboard cameras in the area at the time, as well as other sources, shows the NEO entering the atmosphere, exploding, and creating havoc. The damage to the buildings in the video was caused by the shock wave of the explosion of the asteroid about 20 miles up in the atmosphere.The Chelyabinsk asteroid exploded with a force of about 400 kilotons of TNT, more than the 300 kilotons (1/3 of 1 megaton) of the W87 warhead shown below that was on our missiles during the Cold War. One of these warheads could devastate Manhattan. These are tiny numbers compared to the millions of megatons a very large NEO could generate to wipe out the dinosaurs – or us! If the Chelyabinsk asteroid had come in at a steeper angle, it would have exploded closer to Earth, and besides injuring people, it could have killed much of that city's population of 1 million people.Fig 5: W87 MIRV warheads, each with an explosive power on the low end of NEO sizesFigure 6 below shows the equivalent yield in megatons of TNT versus the size of an NEO in meters (1 meter is about a yard). Please note that we have extreme difficulty discovering NEOs less than 100 meters in size using current telescopes, yet something smaller than this could wipe out an entire city.Fig 6: Equivalent yield in megatons of various NEO sizes, and the damage they can do. Based on Table II, D. Morrison et al. (1994), Hazards Due to Comets and Asteroids, pp. 72-73.How does this relate to your chances of dying from an NEO impact with Earth? Ignore the Interval in Years column of the table in Figure 6. These events do not occur precisely every 4000 years, for example. Instead, they can happen at any time, and the interval and equivalent explosive power of each size of asteroid are used to calculate the probability you face each day in dying from an event of that magnitude.Fig 7: There were TWO ""500 year"" floods during the decade of the 1990s of the Mississippi River basin including the Missouri River shown hereA key point is that we have the SAME chance, each and every day, of dying from an asteroid. Remember there were TWO “500-year” floods of the Mississippi River in the 1990’s – rare events can happen any time, and in bunches.To help understand the serious nature of the threat posed by NEOs to humanity, here is a table ranking threats to humanity (from 1994; more recent figures indicate the risk of death from a large asteroid is reduced, but the risk from smaller ""city-killers"" is larger than calculated a few years ago):Today, most NEO experts believe that the risk of dying from an asteroid impact is about  1/10 that of an airplane crash. Recently, the estimate of impacts the size of Chelyabinsk has gone from every 100 years to every 40 years. Increased knowledge of NEOs brings with it changes in the risk estimates. This is the nature of science. Even if your risk of death is 1/10 that of an airliner crash, Congress does not spend 1/10 of the roughly $20 billion for the FAA and DHS to keep airports and airplanes safe, or $2 billion, on NASA's NEO Observation program. If it did, we would not be appealing to the general public for funds.Large corporations use risk management experts to alert senior management to things they should do to protect their organizations from threats. Members of this risk management community have declared NEOs a moderate, not low, risk worthy of increased funding.If we are able to track both the new discoveries and those that have made one or more orbits around the Sun, our team may be able to give NASA sufficient early warning that they can launch a space mission to move the asteroid away from its collision path from Earth.There are several ways NASA could do this, for example: (a) a space tug using gravity to pull the asteroid just enough to divert it from Earth, (b) nuclear weapons to create jets of matter to propel the asteroid off its collision course, or (c) nuclear weapons to disintegrate the asteroid into small enough pieces that they pose no further harm. This requires long-term tracking of the asteroid, to ensure we know its orbit well enough that we are sure it poses a threat, and to give us sufficient time to act. It takes years to design a new space mission, and a year or more to reach the NEO after the mission is launched from Earth. The larger the telescope we can purchase, the more time we will have to save ourselves.We are part of a small community dedicated to tracking NEOs after the surveys discover them. As the surveys discover the larger ones (one estimate is that 96% of all NEOs a kilometer across and larger have been discovered, and none threaten Earth for the next century), it becomes harder to keep track of the smaller ones. We are hoping to add to the existing resources a telescope optimized for NEO tracking of sufficient size to improve our ability to weed out the NEOs that pose no threat and to focus on the ones that do.2. Why Should We Build a New Telescope Now?Professional surveys are very efficient at discovering new Near Earth Objects (NEOs). The Catalina Sky Survey (one of two of their telescopes is shown below) located north of Tucson in the Catalina Mountains, discovers up to 2/3 of all new NEOs.Fig 8: Catalina Sky Survey 60-inch telescope, which discovers up to 70% of all new NEOsWhat the discovery surveys often do not usually have are the telescopes and staff to continue observing their new discoveries to reduce the errors in their orbits. What is lacking is telescopes to track newly discovered NEOs months after initial discovery to reduce the errors in their orbits. Far too often, we don't know which NEOs pose a serious threat and deserve our attention, and which we can safely ignore. That is the problem your generous donation will help solve.Discovery usually occurs when the NEO is at its brightest, when the Sun, Earth, and NEO are in nearly a straight line. Within days to weeks, the NEO dims rapidly. The errors in the initial discovery points on the sky are large enough to allow thousands or even a million different orbits to be fit to the data points. By observing the NEOs months later, the NEO is further along in its orbit about the Sun, and our observations then reduce the errors.All of the hundreds of NEOs we have observed usually start out with large errors, sometimes with a possible orbit that makes it hit the Earth. Our observations reduce these errors, and limit the number of possible orbits you can draw through all the data points, often removing an NEO from the list of those that could strike the Earth.Fig 9: US national observatory 84-inch telescope, due to be closed August 2014Our situation is that the telescope we use at the US national observatory pictured above will be closed August 1, 2014. The US astronomy community wants to build some very large and expensive telescopes to probe the fundamental nature of the universe (but will not be useful for our purpose), and we fully support these projects. But Congress has not given the National Science Foundation enough money to both build these new telescopes and to keep the ones we use open.If our project is fully funded, we will purchase a telescope that will help us to pay attention to the NEOs that are the most dangerous.3.	Why Isn't the Government Doing This?The two major funding agencies for astronomy and planetary science are the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA. The NSF operates a variety of national and international facilities and awards research grants to individual scientists, but funds astronomy programs with a focus outside the solar system. Congress amended the ""National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958,"" Public Law #85-568, 72 Stat., 426 to include discovering and tracking of NEOs as a fundamental NASA mission.Congress appropriates a small amount each year for this purpose, and NASA wisely uses it to upgrade existing telescopes and to support the building of new ones. However, the current NASA budget is insufficient to build the number of new telescopes dedicated to tracking NEOs that we need. As part of its recent budget cutting, Congress reduced the budgets of both the NSF and NASA, making funding of this telescope using Federal funds impossible. Although the funding of NASA's NEO Observation program has increased recently, they still do not have the funds necessary to build telescopes capable of finding all the targets Congress has mandated that they find.So the federal government does not have the money to support our program. We now turn to the general public, you, who will be most affected if an asteroid hits the Earth to fund the telescope we need to continue this important work.4.	Who Are We?We are a group consisting of Mark Trueblood (Director, Winer Observatory; http://www.winer.org) who will be the Project Manager, Prof. Darren DePoy (Physics and Astronomy Dept., Texas A&M University) who will lead the development of the camera, and Prof. David Hyland (Aerospace Engineering Dept., Texas A&M University) who will provide scientific guidance on how the telescope should be optimized to observe NEOs.Winer Observatory was incorporated in 1983 and is recognized by the IRS under Section 501(c)(3) as a non-profit public charity (contributions are tax deductible). Our goal is to procure a telescope and camera to be placed at Winer's site in southeastern Arizona, where the weather provides over 200 clear nights per year. Most of the group members plan to use their time on the telescope to work with their students to improve the orbits of Near Earth Objects (NEOs), asteroids or comets whose orbits about the Sun bring them very close to (or in collision with) the Earth. Other students will be involved in the design and construction of the camera and possibly the telescope itself, and in using the telescope for a variety of projects during the part of the month that the Moon makes the sky too bright to see faint NEOs.Fig 10: Project Manager Mark Trueblood, Director of Winer Observatory, at the controls of the US national observatory 84-inch telescopeMark Trueblood holds a BS in physics from Brown University and an MS in astronomy from the University of Maryland. Early in his career, he worked in the aerospace industry near Washington, DC where among other assignments, he was the Program Manager for the contract to build the original Hubble Space Telescope control center at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. After moving to Tucson, AZ in 1990 after Hubble was launched, he worked for the US national observatory for 22 years, first as a programmer in charge of developing a large database for the National Solar Observatory, then for 18 years overseeing instrument development for the two Gemini Observatory 8-meter (320-inch) telescopes and for the national observatory’s two 4-meter (160-inch) telescopes. These instrument projects ranged in value from $4 million to $30 million, so he knows how to manage both large and small projects.Since 2008, he has led a team to track and measure NEOs, first at Winer Observatory, then by competing with other astronomers to use national observatory telescopes on Kitt Peak. His team has consistently received high scores from outside review committees, sometimes receiving more nights than requested. The result is 90 publications covering 264 individual NEOs the team has tracked. Trueblood received two NASA grants to support his team’s NEO observations. He was honored when the international association of professional astronomers voted to name asteroid 15522 “Trueblood”.Fig 11: Image of asteroid 15522 TruebloodSo not only can Trueblood lead the project to build the telescope, he can lead the team to use the telescope to track NEOs.Fig 12: If we surpass our goal, we will buy a telescope large enough that two professors at Texas A&M University have expressed interest in joining our projectThere are two professors at Texas A&M who are interested in joining our project if we are able to raise enough money. Prof. Darren DePoy of the Physics and Astronomy Department builds instruments, including serving as the Dark Energy Camera project scientist. Before moving to TAMU, DePoy was the Vice Chair of the Astronomy Department at The Ohio State University, where he led the development of two large spectrographs for the world’s largest telescope, located in Arizona. DePoy is interested in building a wide-field camera for our project.The other TAMU researcher is Prof. David Hyland of the Aerospace Engineering Department, where he is a noted researcher in the field of NEOs.Fig 13: Our Project Advisory Committee is composed of experts in NEOs and asteroids, technical project management, and an astronaut who is a leading advocate for NEO researchWe have an Advisory Committee consisting of the following experts in asteroids and comets, technical management, and sound business principles (left to right in Fig 13 above):Dr. Clark R. Chapman, NEO impact risk expertDr. Alan R. Harris, asteroid orbit and photometry expertMr. Wayne Rosing, former VP of Engineering, Google, Inc. and founder of the Las Cumbres ObservatoryMr. Russell L. Schweickart, Apollo 9 astronaut, Chairman of the B612 Foundation which advocates for a strong coordinated NEO programDr. David H. Levy, successful comet hunter, former Parade Magazine science editor, and proponent of astronomy eduction and public outreachAll members of the Advisory Committee have endorsed our project.Furthermore, we have an encouraging letter from Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Director of the Rose Center at the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. Dr. Tyson appeared on the PBS television science series NOVA, the History Channel's series The Universe, and several other shows, including one giving the Top 10 threats to human existence (Dr. Tyson presented the No. 4 threat, NEOs). Dr. Tyson cannot endorse our project or any other, but he does support NEO research in general.Fig 14: Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium, encourages NEO research5. You Can See the Positive Effect of Your ContributionFirst, we have a website (http://www.projectasteroid.org) that describes NEOs in more detail, where we will post our progress from time to time. Currently, that web site is geared to larger telescope projects. We will modify that website when our fundraising is complete, and we have determined what size telescope we will be able to afford using your generous donations.When the telescope and camera are installed and working, we will begin observing NEOs. Typically, we reduce our observations that night, and submit them to the Minor Planet Center (MPC) in Cambridge, MA, where they are published in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular (MPEC). We invite you to follow along (http://www.winer.org/Science/MPEC.php) and monitor our progress as our observations are published in MPECs.Fig 15: Image of Messier 33 (M33). You can take a picture like this using our telescope!But most important, you, our donors, can have access to our telescope to take your own pictures of space -- the planets, the Moon, asteroids, clusters of stars, beautiful clouds of dust and gas, and other galaxies outside our own. We will give you access to an imaging system capable of producing detailed electronic images in color, if you donate $100 or more. Check out the rewards -- there is a level of telescope use with every level of donations. Take a ""selfie"" of you at your computer displaying the image you took using the telescope you helped fund!6. What Your Money BuysFig 16: Project budgetPlease note that we plan to contribute $70,000 of our own funds to this project. We see this as a partnership, with both you and us participating.7. How This Telescope Can Save Planet EarthFig 17: If we meet our goal, we would purchase a telescope such as the one pictured hereWe will purchase a telescope, such as the one pictured above, if we meet our goal. Such a telescope will enable us to follow up on new discoveries a few days after discovery and to help determine which objects reported by the surveys are indeed NEOs.Fig 18: If funding permits, we will buy a larger telescope, enabling us to track fainter (smaller, but still lethal) NEOsIf we exceed our goal by a substantial amount, we will purchase a larger telescope that allows us to track smaller objects that could destroy entire states. Such a telescope can track brighter NEOs further along their orbits, reducing the errors in their calculated orbits. It would also permit us to track fainter NEOs for longer than otherwise. Reducing orbit errors means we can ignore the NEOs that pose no threat to Earth, and focus on the ones that might hit the Earth.If we do not reach our goal, we will evaluate what funds we do receive and consult with our partners and advisors to determine how best to use the funds.No matter what size telescope we are able to buy, the observing technique is the same. We take 3 to 5 pictures of the same area of the sky, shift them so the stars line up, and the asteroid motion is readily apparent, as shown here.We are tied to planet Earth as it orbits the Sun in what is effectively a giant pinball machine, yet, like driving your car without collision insurance, we do not have in place an adequate network of telescopes large enough to track all the objects being discovered that could threaten our home planet. Each month, the surveys discover dozens or even 100 new NEOs, but about 20% (mostly the fainter ones) are not re-observed after discovery well enough to get an accurate orbit. For practical purposes, they cannot be recovered in the future unless just by luck a survey re-discovers them. That means we do not know their orbits well enough to know whether or not they will hit the Earth.Our telescope will be imaging NEOs every clear night when the Moon does not interfere by lighting up the sky. We will be keeping track of the newly discovered objects and tracking them to reduce errors in our understanding of their orbits. We will diligently report our measurements to the Minor Planet Center so that everyone in the NEO community can make use of our observations. With your help, we will provide that ""collision insurance"" for the Earth.Since our telescope will be used for educating students as well as tracking NEOs, on nights too bright (when the moon lights up the sky) to work on NEOs, we will schedule student observations of variable stars, stars that might have planets going around them, and other objects of interest. This is the educational part of our project.People are interested in many things: training for the Olympics, finding a cure for cancer, the activities of Hollywood stars, their own family and friends, and so on. This is the way it should be – we should each be pursuing our own happiness. But NONE of this matters if an asteroid hits Earth and ends your life. All the centuries of human endeavor, from walking across a field in the Rift Valley in Africa to walking on the Moon, all of human history could be obliterated by a large asteroid impact.Fig 19: Please help us prove humans are smarter than the dinosaurs, who had no space programPlease help us prove we are smarter than the dinosaurs, which were wiped out by an NEO impact 65 million years ago.

Please make your contributions through this Indiegogo web site, up to their limit of $10,000 (for larger amounts, you may need to make multiple contributions at the levels that sum to your desired donation). We need your support through Indiegogo. If we fail to meet our campaign goal, the service fees we pay are considerably higher, the additional costs possibly amounting to $10,000 or more. After our campaign ends, feel free to use the Donate button on our own website.
If you want a digital image of a celestial object (at a qualifying backer level), just give us the name of the object by email after the campaign ends. Or specify the celestial coordinates. We will figure out the exposure time, what time of year to observe your object, etc. We will take the image and email it to you.
When taking pictures using our telescope, please remember that as a ground-based observatory, we are subject to the weather. Our location provides a large number of clear nights each year, but we have a summer monsoon season July through September when we close down to prevent lightning damage. If the weather louses up your photo, we will reschedule it for a later time, with the date depending on demand and your donation level. Professional astronomers do not get this service -- if they are clouded out, they are out of luck and have to submit another proposal for a time when their target is visible. And the second time around, they might not get the time they request. For our project, you will get your time.
We reserve the right to schedule your image on our public outreach 14-inch telescope. First, it may be better suited to what you want to photograph (if you want a photo of Mars, you probably do not want a tiny dot in the middle of a large picture of zillions of stars). Second, it can take 2 to 4 years to purchase and install a new telescope, as most of the telescopes the size we wish to purchase are custom designed and built after the order is received. We want to get you the reward you are due as quickly as possible, but we also want to make it as high quality as possible.
Some objects are very faint. If you choose a contribution level with only a few minutes of time, if we believe you could not get a good image in the time available, we will let you know, so that you can either change your contribution or change your target. The Moon can be imaged in about a second, planets can be imaged in a few minutes, while galaxies tend to take a half hour or more.
Not all celestial objects are visible every night of the year. As the Earth goes around the Sun, different parts of the sky become visible in different seasons. For example, the constellation Orion is visible in the early evening during northern hemisphere winter, but at different times during the night or not at all in other seasons. We will attempt to give each donor personalized service in scheduling their telescope time.

<h2>Testimonials about earlier ceremonies</h2>
<p>There are lots of testimonials on the ceremonies in German. Some examples translated into English: </p>
<p>""I felt very powerful energies. I also noticed a formerly unknown amount of physical energy in my body and sitting still is very difficult for me!"" Gabriela D'Amico</p>
<p>""I felt a lot of energy in my body, soft, warm, very subtle. But the strongest effect i noticed was in the Solarplexus, where I felt an anchoring in the deep being of my true self. I felt so deeply, how much power I have there. I'm still feeling this"" Martin Engler</p>
<p>""During this ceremony I felt lots of very soft and subtle energies (not meaning this was weak at all!) They worked especially on my lower back, where I have a huge scar. The energy was working there and in my left hip. I still noticed hours later! Then my pelvis got very warm and the energy rose quite a bit up my spine! I felt so fantastic the next day and the scar feels different since then!"" Ilka Mischak</p>

Ever wonder if your loved one is riding with an optimal tire pressure?  When FOBO Share is in use, the owner can view the tire pressures on his or her very own smartphone even when the Sharee is riding far away.  Likewise, when the owner is riding far away on the motorcycle, the Sharee can view the tire pressures on his or her very own phone.  This is done through FOBO's patented technology.

 
 


The patented CrossPair technology enables a seamless swap from one smart device to another to monitor FOBO Bike 2. This feature is useful when changing to a new phone or just simply swapping to a different phone.  All installed FOBO Bike 2 profiles will be transferred to the new device, without the need to individually pair and install again. 
 
 

The first level of deterrent is done with proprietary nuts and wrench.  In the event that the sensor is still stolen, it cannot be installed again.   This second level of deterrent removes the economic value of the sensor.   For ownership transfer, the original owner must release the sensors from his profile using the app.

WE ARE IN PRODUCTION

  Risks and challenges We challenge ourselves to produce a wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring System(TPMS) for motorcycles that is inconspicuous and yet robust and reliable. We want it to be like no other TPMS in the World today.  We had to choose the latest and right technologies in hardware, squeeze many components onto a tiny PCB, produce the most reliable antenna performance into a small mechanical enclosure. The FOBO Bike 2 uses Bluetooth 5 technology for wireless communication with smart devices(such as smartphones, smart watches and Bluetooth headsets) and automotive grade award winning pressure sensor that reads fine resolution of pressure.  We challenged the convention of design rules to attain waterproof standard and tested the product against stringent international mechanical & environment testing standards.  The app had to connect flawlessly with the firmware of the components and work with Android and iOS devices using Bluetooth 5, even when the vehicle is traveling at high speed!We had overcome all these challenges and we are ready to take this product into mass production and commit to delivery.   About UsWe are a group of enthusiastic engineers with passion in design and creation.  With extensive experience with designing products based on Bluetooth wireless technology, we created the FOBO brand, an acronym for For Our Better wOrld.  FOBO carries a mandate to help enhance mankind’s daily living through innovative and smart products. FOBO products get in tune with Nature, by monitoring key environmental elements that interact with our daily livings or things/loved ones that we care so much about; FOBO is Sensing with Sense TM.We had successfully launched three Indiegogo campaigns in the past, namely FOBO Tire and FOBO Bike and FOBO TAG and accomplished timely delivery to our backers.  We are confident to delivery again a high quality and reliable product in this campaign.   
Shipping & Logistics for FOBO Bike 2

<p>The C57 is unlike any other flashlight.  We start with an aluminum body then wrap the light in rugged, light-weight, high-end materials resulting in an extremely durable and strong flashlight.    </p>
<p><b>Titanium</b></p>
<p>Titanium is the strength of steel, but nearly half the weight and unaffected by the environment.</p>
<p><b>Carbon Fiber</b></p>
<p>The carbon fiber provides an added layer of protection to the aluminum core, acts as an insulator, and keeps the handle at a moderate temperature in extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><b>Aluminum</b></p>
<p>6061 aircraft aluminum creates a lightweight, strong core.</p>
<p><b>Coatings</b></p>
<p>For the aluminum we use Hard Coat Anodizing and Chromium Tungsten for the titanium. </p>
<p> **Cerakote titanium end cap, heat shield and button is limited to the Snow Trooper model.</p>
<p><b>Lens</b></p>
<p>Sapphire provides an extremely hard and scratch resistant lens.  </p>

<p>Utilizing the latest technology in engineering, rapid prototyping and manufacturing allowed us to quickly innovate, prototype and test various designs.  With a team member on the ground in Asia, we were able to find high-quality strategic partners that could produce the required precision we needed to manufacture a superior product- from the premium finishes to the precision machining down to the potted electronics.  </p>

The C57 is the ultimate high performance light. Constructed of titanium, carbon fiber and aluminum. An efficient LED produces up to 20 days of constant run-time. Four light settings cater to every occasion — from moonlight to high burst.
The C57 is IPX-8 water submersible. Chromium tungsten and hard anodized coatings produce a rugged, durable finish.
The C57 is the most color customizable flashlight on the planet. From the carbon tubes to the anodizing color options. Also, the LED emitter can swapped out to allow even greater customization.

What is Cerakote?
Cerakote is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote products remain at the foreforont of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications. - NIC Industries

The C57 is unlike any other flashlight.  We start with an aluminum body then wrap the light in rugged, light-weight, high-end materials resulting in an extremely durable and strong flashlight.    
Titanium
Titanium is the strength of steel, but nearly half the weight and unaffected by the environment.
Carbon Fiber
The carbon fiber provides an added layer of protection to the aluminum core, acts as an insulator, and keeps the handle at a moderate temperature in extreme temperatures.
Aluminum
6061 aircraft aluminum creates a lightweight, strong core.
Coatings
For the aluminum we use Hard Coat Anodizing and Chromium Tungsten for the titanium. 
 **Cerakote titanium end cap, heat shield and button is limited to the Snow Trooper model.
Lens
Sapphire provides an extremely hard and scratch resistant lens.

<p>You found us! Thank you for that, and for helping us build our dream! We are creating Wasatch Bike Park, Utah’s first indoor mountain bike and BMX park. We’re looking to take some vacant warehouse space close to downtown Salt Lake City, and convert it to become an indoor mountain bike and BMX park.</p>
<p>Wasatch Bike Park will have tracks, obstacles and jumps for mountain bike and BMX riders of all skill levels. We’ll also have retail sales, a full-service repair shop, a lounge, bike and equipment rentals, and more.</p>
<p>Utah is known as a mountain biker’s paradise, and it’s our goal to allow people to bike year-round, in a fun and challenging environment. But, the Wasatch Crew also plans on being heavily involved in the local bike race scene, as well as trail-building and advocacy efforts.</p>
<p>In short, we want to help make mountain biking in Utah as good as it can be, both inside and out!</p>
<p>We believe in this project whole-heartedly because we’re providing what the Utah outdoor community has asked for. As Salt Lake City has worked to re-develop is warehouse and granary districts over the past decade, the conventional wisdom has undergone a shift from wanting a fancy-new-place to “buy” stuff, to wanting open &amp; public space to “do” stuff.</p>
<p>Through your generosity, it will allow the Wasatch Bike Park crew to build the park over the summer, and get it ready to open next fall—just when Utah’s winter is kicking in!</p>
<p><strong>Why indiegogo!?</strong></p>
<p>We’re asking for a good chunk of money. We’re doing this for two huge reasons: First, like you, we want this project up and running, and 100% complete, as fast as possible.  Second, we want our community, and other like-minded individuals, to be able to reap the rewards and share in our successes.</p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise the capital needed to catapult the project to the next level. We’re aggressively pursuing funding from multiple resources, and this will help speed up the process! It will also help facilitate park design, and the purchasing of materials to help build the park.</p>
<p>The breakdown of campaign funds we’re attempting to raise will be spent as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% will be spent on materials such as 2x4s, plywood, nails, and other things that build a bike park.</li>
<li>20% of funds asked will go toward building out the bathroom areas, and adding a women's bathroom (it's a warehouse built in the 60s--what did you expect?).</li>
<li>The remaining 10% will be used to build-out our shop and lounge areas.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Our Gifts to You!</strong></p>
<p>If you chose to help us raise money, we will show our overwhelming thanks with gifts of gratitude! From fun little things to things that just rock, we are offering up the following perks to our generous benefactors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tee-Shirts and Stickers with our pretty sweet logo!</li>
<li>Day, Month, and even Season Passes to the bike park!</li>
<li>Free Tune-Up (a $40 value)!</li>
<li>Naming rights for specific sections of track!</li>
<li>Your name on our future Sponsor Wall!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>It’s because mountain biking in Utah is amazing! And people want to do it year-round.  Utah’s snow is amazing too, but mountain biking and BMX riding in it is pretty hard (if you can even access the trails and pump tracks). </p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to weave education and recreation together, while providing access to diverse experiences throughout all four seasons along the Wasatch Front.</p>
<p><strong>Not All Contributions Need to be $!</strong></p>
<p>We are excited and thankful that you’ve read this far. We are immensely grateful if you chose to donate to our vision. If you can’t, we’re very grateful for your interest – and we ask you to please help us spread the word about Wasatch Bike Park!</p>

Utah is known as a mountain biker’s paradise, and it’s our goal to allow people to bike year-round, in a fun and challenging environment. But, the Wasatch Crew also plans on being heavily involved in the local bike race scene, as well as trail-building and advocacy efforts.
In short, we want to help make mountain biking in Utah as good as it can be, both inside and out!
We believe in this project whole-heartedly because we’re providing what the Utah outdoor community has asked for. As Salt Lake City has worked to re-develop is warehouse and granary districts over the past decade, the conventional wisdom has undergone a shift from wanting a fancy-new-place to “buy” stuff, to wanting open & public space to “do” stuff.
Through your generosity, it will allow the Wasatch Bike Park crew to build the park over the summer, and get it ready to open next fall—just when Utah’s winter is kicking in!
Why indiegogo!?
We’re asking for a good chunk of money. We’re doing this for two huge reasons: First, like you, we want this project up and running, and 100% complete, as fast as possible.  Second, we want our community, and other like-minded individuals, to be able to reap the rewards and share in our successes.
Our goal for this campaign is to raise the capital needed to catapult the project to the next level. We’re aggressively pursuing funding from multiple resources, and this will help speed up the process! It will also help facilitate park design, and the purchasing of materials to help build the park.
The breakdown of campaign funds we’re attempting to raise will be spent as follows:

70% will be spent on materials such as 2x4s, plywood, nails, and other things that build a bike park.
20% of funds asked will go toward building out the bathroom areas, and adding a women's bathroom (it's a warehouse built in the 60s--what did you expect?).
The remaining 10% will be used to build-out our shop and lounge areas.
Our Gifts to You!
If you chose to help us raise money, we will show our overwhelming thanks with gifts of gratitude! From fun little things to things that just rock, we are offering up the following perks to our generous benefactors:

Tee-Shirts and Stickers with our pretty sweet logo!
Day, Month, and even Season Passes to the bike park!
Free Tune-Up (a $40 value)!
Naming rights for specific sections of track!
Your name on our future Sponsor Wall!
Why?
It’s because mountain biking in Utah is amazing! And people want to do it year-round.  Utah’s snow is amazing too, but mountain biking and BMX riding in it is pretty hard (if you can even access the trails and pump tracks). 
Ultimately, our goal is to weave education and recreation together, while providing access to diverse experiences throughout all four seasons along the Wasatch Front.
Not All Contributions Need to be $!

<p>My name is Melissa {Midge} Rebholz and I've been involved in cooking, growing and promoting local food for the past 10 years.  I began with a love of local ingredients and a weekly volunteer spot at my neighborhood<a href=""https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Greenmarket </a>in Brooklyn, NY.  I woke early every Saturday to do a local foods cooking demonstration at the market using ingredients fresh from each farmer's field.  This involvement with <a href=""https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenmarket</a> led me to a management position the following year while I also attended the <a href=""https://naturalgourmetinstitute.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Natural Gourmet Institute</a> and received my culinary degree. </p>
<p> After spending 2 years talking to farmers almost daily I decided I could no longer live as a ""groupie"" and wanted to go experience farm life for myself. I moved to a certified organic farm on Long Island  for one year with plans to return to the city in the late fall.  It's currently 8 years later I've never looked back.  I fell in love with rural life and farming.  In 2015, the Urban Exodus project came by to get the full scoop on my transition from city to county and you can read all about that <a href=""https://www.urbanexodus.com/melissa-rebholz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>. </p>
<p>I traveled from New York City to California taking different seasonal apprenticeships and farm hand positions.  In 2013, I landed a Farm Manager position with a small non-profit in East Tennessee.  I packed up my truck in Northern California and made the cross-country trek once more.  </p>
<p>I found a beautiful house and property to lease on the Nolichuckey River while I managed the farm down the road and fell in love with a farmer across the mountains in North Carolina.  I have hosted AirBnB for the past 3 years as well as taking on catering gigs, held farm to table dinners on the property and taught cooking classes to at-risk teenagers in my community.  </p>
<p>In 2016 I took a risk and left my management position to operate my own farm, River House Farm, with my partner.  It was a challenging year and we were living in 2 different states and farming 3 different properties to make ends meet.  We started the farm on a shoestring budget and probably had the hardest year of both of our lives.   We started 2017 freshly relaxed from  a winter vacation and starting selling CSA Shares to fund our Spring expenses.   Unfortunately due to irreconcilable differences in our personal and working relationship, 2017 will be my last year working this land. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we leased this land and now it's time for me to move on.  Time to explore what is out there and in the process maybe find my very own forever farm.   </p>
<h3>What's the Money for?</h3>
<p>I am crowdfunding to raise $10,000 to purchase a small travel trailer and a truck to tow it.  I have been looking at 14 - 18 ft. trailers which I believe can be procured for roughly $2,000-$3000 leaving $7000 for a dependable truck to pull it.  My current trusty Ford F150 has a number of repairs including replacing the rear end that I'm not able to invest in.  It also doesn't have the capacity to tow the type of trailer  I am looking for. </p>
<p>Where am I going in this trailer?  To a local farm NEAR YOU!  I started an Instagram account 5 years ago and my first photo was of a direct sown patch of greens on Cannard Farm in Sonoma in April of 2012.   It got 3 ""likes"".  5,500 photos and 14,000 followers later there is such a strong online community of small farms connecting worldwide through this app on our phones.  We've traded stories via photos of our success, failure, heartache and resiliency.  Farmers who I've never met in person feel like family.  Folks have walked me through mechanical issues, disease and pest identification, sent me brand new rain pants, products from their farms, even money during hard times.  Most importantly this community has acted as a sound board and a shoulder to cry on in the tough times which can be ever so more intensified in an isolated rural area.  </p>
<p>I'd like to hit the road now to meet this vast community of farmers across our country.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I will reach out to farms I have followed online and folks I know from previous farms to come up with a schedule for my year long journey.  I am looking for work-trade and paid farming opportunities as well as the ability to teach cooking classes and host a series of farm to table dinners.</p>
<p>I'm a hard working woman and just because I won't have land of my own to farm anymore, I still want to spend the year doing what I love.  I see this as an opportunity to help others to do good work and hope there is a mutual learning opportunity there as well.  I have much to offer and I have much to learn from what other farmers are doing, young and old. </p>
<p>Home to me is really more about doing what you love everyday and inner peace rather than a specific place or piece of furniture. </p>
<p>I'll be starting a YouTube channel during this trip as a documentation of what living off the land and growing food for your community looks like across the USA.  Documenting recipes, farm hacks, growing practices and avenues of distribution.  I would love the final outcome of this journey to be a travelogue/cookbook project resulting from the farm to table dinners and of exploring the beauty of American's Farmland. </p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The challenge for me personally lies within re-organizing how work gets done and the balancing act of trying to do everything at once. </p>
<p>For that reason, I am looking for a trailer sooner rather than later so that during this season when I have a rainy day or a few hours to myself I can incrementally begin modifying it and preparing for this journey. </p>
<p>While moving around and farming in different places has been eye opening and exciting I have realized that I have put so very much of myself into places that I've had to leave.  I am raising the funds for this transportation hoping that it will allow me to later save the money I make this last year in Tennessee towards making the next land that I pour my heart and soul into, my forever land.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that its a lean time for a lot of people.  Especially farmers.  If you don't have the ability to help make this trip a reality please share this campaign wherever you can!  Social media, email....etc.  Every little share helps.  </p>
<p>Thank You in advance for helping make this dream come true.  I truly believe the documentation of this journey will be wide-reaching and eye-opening and I can't wait to share it all with you. </p>
