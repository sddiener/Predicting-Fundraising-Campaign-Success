The Impact


Imagine you just bought a Ready to assemble TV Stand to watch the Superbowl [or awesome movie] with your friends and/or love ones. You have to prepare the snacks, clean the house, suit up, etc. But wait you still need to put the furniture together (here is were the drama begins).

You notice there are instructions and grab them, after another 5 minutes you finally understand the ancient hieroglyphs and then realize that the figures do not look anything like the furniture parts.


 You start wondering if you should return the furniture... But Oh My Gosh the show just started!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm starting a campaign to produce soybean &amp; canola biofuel for the Green and Libertarian parties. I'm planning on producing both conventional GMO vegetable oil, as well as food-grade certified organic soybean oil. How much of each depends on your contributions.</p>
<p>I need $55,000 to do this, and here's how I'll spend it: (click image for details)</p>

<p>I am starting with 1000 bushels of conventional GMO soybeans as a baseline, that will produce a little over 1000 gallons of biodiesel. This would turn out to provide enough fuel to run a campaign bus at about 6mpg from Maine to California, and then back again. (6000 miles). If you want to see some of those 1000 bushels as organic, please select the Organic Green Oil perk or the Libertarian Oil Independence perk.</p>
<p>Any money raised after we pay expenses in October will be donated to the two alternative party campaigns for a final advertising blitz before election day on November 6. Unlike most other political organizations, budgets and expenses for this effort will be posted for public review. If it is not possible to deliver fuel directly to the third party campaigns, then all funds will be used to produce biodiesel that will be sold into the regular market as an offset.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Supporting the Department of Green Energy is going to create local jobs, make America more secure, and reduce our collective carbon footprint</li>
<li>Help us make energy policy, and the hard choices about food vs fuel something that we can all participate in again, instead of partisan hacks and big corporate interest lobbyists</li>
<li>Bring some direct accountability and transparency to fuel and energy issues</li>
<li>Raise awareness about third parties</li>
</ul>
<p>We have the ability to ensure a safe, reliable, abundant, and cost-effective energy supply that puts carbon back in the ground, with no new legislation or policy.

<h3>IGNITION INTERLOCK | TRACKING | BREATHALYZER</h3>
<p>Our device gives parents peace of mind knowing their loved one is operating their vehicle in a safe and sober manner as well as tracking their whereabouts. Our product also protects the vehicle from unauthorized use and/or theft. The car will not start if the interlock device does not recognize the cell phone - as in the case of a stranger's cell phone -  thus preventing theft of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>SMARTPHONE APPLICATION</h3>
<p>Our device is accompanied by a smartphone app that allows you to customize its features to best suit your child. Imagine the relief of knowing your child is safe while on the road!</p>

<p>With the smartphone app, you can choose to track your child's location and receive speeding alerts enabling you to monitor your child's safety. Geofences and points of interests can also be set by the parent/authorized user, therefore if the driver enters such places as a bar or is crossing state or province lines -for instance- an alert will be sent to the parent. </p>

<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>

<li>Download the Not Your Child app and pair the device with your phone.</li>
<li>Connect the breathalyzer to your vehicle.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the breathalyzer detects any impairment after the driver provides a breath sample, the interlock system will block the ignition from starting and you will receive a notification. Now, you have potentially saved the life of a loved one as well as others on the road. However, if you're not concerned about impaired driving, you may remove this particular feature.</p>

The walnut model is available in a totally brand new version! Bright alluminium top ring and translucent white safety filter.


ZEBRAWOOD VERSION WITH BRASS TOP RING

AMARANTH WITH STUNNING CORTEN TOP RING


WHY THE NAME FEBO? 
Phoebus (/ˈfiːbəs/ fee-bəs; Φοῖβος, Phoibos, literally ""bright""), which was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans in Apollo's role as the GOD OF LIGHT.





Febo is a simple tool which allows you to draw with the sun. It focuses its rays onto your chosen canvas to create a uniquely personal design. It was designed with the aim of turning nature into beautiful, creative and permanent works of art. Due to its simplicity you can personalize your favorite belongings in minutes!
Febo is fun for all ages and skill levels!







Beautiful illustration #MADEWITHFEBO by the illustrator Francesca Padovan






Febo is much more than a regular magnifying glass, it is a proper tool designed to make your drawing experience really unique. 
Its wooden body is precisely calibrated in order to immediately focus the sun's rays once you place Febo on the object of your choice. Its size makes it super comfortable to hold, making your creative projects easy and enjoyable. 




IT WILL LAST FOREVER: batteries are not required



SKILL LEVELS: stencils are included to make your first project easy and successful!

We designed 8 different stencils suitable for a broad range of applications. They are divided into 3 different categories:
• Icons, including foods, animals and other useful shapes • Letters and numbers, including, well, letters and numbers






CONNECT WITH NATURE: spend more time outdoors, creating and personalizing your projects! 




IT STARTS WORKING INSTANTLY: personalize your favorite belongings in minutes! If you trace your drawing with GRAPHITE it starts work instantly




UNIQUE TRACES: every trace will be unique depending on the strength of the sun and the objects you choose to personalize. 



MAKE AN ORDINARY OBJECT YOUR OWN: the possibilities are endless! 




CRAFTED WITH LOVE IN ITALY: the combination of wood and glass make it refined and durable



Each FEBO comes with a pair of rollable lenses one size fits all, automatically adjusting to the contours of each individual's face. 
They provide 100% UV PROTECTION with only 6% to 8% visible light transmission.  




Always wear your sunglasses before using Febo. Place Febo on the surface you want to customize. Wood, plywood, cork, leather and cardboard are all compatible materials. Keep the sun behind your back and tilt the surface perpendicularly to it. Thanks to the special design of the sphere on Febo's base you are able to keep track and see clearly your design. Once you have removed the safety filter, the lens absorbs the sun's rays precisely onto the selected material. Now the fun begins, start engraving! The density of the stroke depends on the weather, every cloud will produce a different kind of trace, with different thickness and intensity making it unique.


Febo can be used in any season of the year, even in winter after a snowfall: all you need is a clear sky! 




• 1 Trace the drawings with the pencil  • 2 Always wear sunglasses • 3 Remove the colored safety filter• 4 Place the drawing surface (wood, cork, leather...) at a 90° angle• 5 Start engraving and have fun!

I would have to say the biggest hurdle is getting high quality stainless steel at a reasonable prices. And we will not compromise on quality.

Stell dir vor du hättest die Möglichkeit mit einer kleinen Investition großes zu bewegen.Du könntest beim Autofahren bis zu 30% Kraftstoff sparen  - und nicht nur das -gleichzeitig würdest du 50 - 80% weniger Schadstoffausstoß produzieren.Das hilft der Umwelt und kommt gleichzeitig deinem Geldbeutel zugute.
DER UMWELT ZULIEBE -

ULTIMATE CELL
Wie das gehen soll ???

Ganz einfach:Mitte November starten wir die Markteinführung von ULTIMATE CELL in Deutschland, einem  Gerät das für Benzin und Dieselmotoren gleichermaßen geeignet ist.
ULTIMATE CELL wird in PKW, LKW, Bussen, Generatoren , Booten, Land-und Baumaschinen, Diesellokomotiven ..., kurz Verbrennungsmotoren bis zu 40 Liter Hubraum, verbaut.
Ultimate Cell produziert geringe Mengen an Wasserstoff, gibt diese über den Luftansaugtrakt des Fahrzeugs in den Brennraum des Motors ab und dient dort als Katalysator für eine bessere, effektivere Verbrennung.Das Gerät ist Wartungsfrei. Eine Füllung reicht für 70.000 km Laufleistung beim KFZ oder 2.000 Stunden Dauerbetrieb bei Booten und Generatoren .Danach lassen sie es einfach von ihrerm Ultimate Cell Fachhändler auffüllen und fahren die nächsten 70.000 km.Wenn sie ihr Fahrzeug verkaufen möchten, bauen wir ihnen ihre Ultimate Cell einfach aus und in ihr neues Fahrzeug wieder ein.-VERBRENNUNG OHNE ULTIMATE CELL

VERBRENNUNG MIT ULTIMATE CELL

Der Einbau von ULTIMATE CELL führt nachweislich zu einerKraftstoffeinsparung von bis zu 30 % bei gleichzeitiger Reduzierung des Schadstoffausstoßes von bis zu 80 % .
Partikelfilter und Katalysatoren setzen sich nicht mehr so schnell zu - das bedeutet weniger Regenerationsfahrten.Keine Carbon und Teflonablagerungen mehr im Motor - ihr Motor läuft ruhiger und lebt länger.
Ultimate Cell wird schon in vielen Ländern der Welt mit wachsendem Erfolg vertrieben und wird nun nach ausgiebigen Tests die E - Zertifizierung erhalten und somit auch in Deutschland verkauft werden dürfen.HURRA ES IST GESCHAFFT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SEIT 17.10.2014 HABEN WIR DAS INTERNATIONALE E-PRÜFZEICHEN !!!DAS BEDEUTET, DASS WIR AB MITTE NOVEMBER MIT DEM VERKAUF VON ULTIMATE CELL BEGINNEN KÖNNEN !!!!!!!!!Wir werden in Kürze ein Händlernetzwerk, verteilt auf die gesamte Bundesrepublik etablieren, dass aus ca. 1000 Distributoren bestehen wird.Die Distributoren werden von uns speziell im Einbau von ULTIMATE CELL  geschult und diese dann in ihrer jeweiligen Region verbauen.

Through our extensive user interview, we realized that people want to selectively send some of his or her calendar events to digital.Here is how the daily planner treated with your paper privacy.

 
If you want to send the event to digital. you can tick the calendar icon. it will be on your digital calendar magically.
 
 
 
3.3Répondez s'il vous plaît - let's keep you posted
Synchronizing the digital calendars isn't the only thing you can do with this system.  Tick on the share icon enable your event to send to your family and friends.

 
3.4Share your idea The planner has plenty of pages where you can jot down your thoughts and ideas.

A memo page is divided into four and each section can be separated shared to your favorite destination. 
3.5Instant Google search Throughout our user interviews and analytics, we realized many people use the pen while the pen is connected to the App; Neo Studio. They are using a phone as a mirroring device of their paper. So we decided to add features that help them to focus on their work.

When you have your own ideation or co-creation session with your teammates, you probably have your pen in your fingers and write something down.  All of sudden, if you want to search for something from the web. you need to switch back & forth the app. We were thinking what if we add an icon that triggers to pop up Google search. Voila, this is the icon short-cutting Google search.
 
3.6Hashtag to organize better
In the same manner, you can also evoke the Hashtags menu of Neo Studio. 

4. Plan and control your way
4.1 Plan your monthsHere's what the monthly page looks like. We add special functions to each section of the monthly layout. You can even share the entire month of your plan. 

4.2 Plan your weeksWe spent lots of time to design this weekly layout which contains;

Weekly goal tracker
Calendar event - 3 slots for each day. 
Memo area


As you can see, when you open up the planner you see the entire week at once. There are lots of control points where you can make it digitally doable. Moreover, a large portion of memo space gives you a day-to-today memo in your weekly spread.
 
4.3 Cope with your thoughts and ideas
Your ideas come with any notice.  Pen and paper will be the best tools to record your thoughts and idea. We prepared four types of memo layouts to meet your occasions.

But, there was one problem they didn’t anticipate… how to carry both their coffee and water around at the same time. Carrying two bottles was a hassle.</p><p>Over the years, as the coffee got consumed, their new addiction gave Dorothy an idea… “someone needs to invent a bottle that holds coffee and water at the same time”.</p><p>They didn’t exactly jump on a solution, but by 2017, Dorothy’s patience was running out. “Are we going to develop this coffee/water bottle or not?

You need your delicious hot coffee to stay awake and get you through the day, and you need your water to, well, stay healthy and live. But bringing both your coffee mug and water bottle is a huge hassle.That’s why we created H2Joe. We wanted a bottle that allowed us to carry coffee AND water without having to juggle between bottles.The coffee had to stay hot, and the water had to stay cold. And there had to be enough to keep us hydrated and energized.To drink your coffee, flip open the cap and drink from the sip friendly opening. To drink your water, unscrew the cap and drink from the traditional water spout.Sip or swig? With H2Joe, you get both.Not only does your coffee stay hot and water stay cold, you’ll be able to sip your coffee AND swig your water comfortably and exactly the way it was meant to be - without any hassle!The water and coffee compartments are isolated and insulated to ensure their temperatures don’t affect each other.H2Joe’s patent-pending lid comes with two distinct openings. One for coffee. And another for water.The coffee opening pops open to allow for easy and safe sipping. While the water cap unscrews to allow for a quick swig.H2Joe is easy to fill. Each compartment has its own large mouth opening with a leak-proof seal to prevent unwanted spills.The coffee holder unscrews from the bottom to reveal the mouth opening. The water container is simply filled by removing the top lid. Our coffee compartment is a 12oz container on the bottom half of the bottle. The compartment is vacuum sealed with double walled insulation and is made from 304 Food Grade Stainless Steel. Best of all, it keeps your coffee hot for up to 6 hours.To refill, simply unscrew the compartment and fill through the large opening. Screw it back on and you’re ready to go!Our water compartment is a 12oz container on the upper half of the bottle. The compartment is triple-insulated to keep your water cold for 8 hours and is made with BPA-Free Food Safe Polypropylene.To refill, unscrew the top lid and fill through the large top opening. Screw it back on and stay hydrated throughout your day!Because each compartment can be easily detached and provides a large mouth opening, cleaning the H2Joe is extremely easy and effective.Simply unscrew the coffee holder to wash it out.The water compartment can be easily accessed through the large mouth opening after you unscrew the top lid.H2Joe is also completely dishwasher safe! Take apart the different compartments, put them in the dishwasher, and you’re good for your next workday!
 We made H2Joe so we could stay on top of our hydration and health as we powered through our work day. So naturally, we made H2Joe with only the safest, highest quality food grade materials such as 304 food-safe stainless steel and BPA-free plastics.From the upper lid & exterior shell to the water container & insulation, H2Joe is completely 100% BPA Free.The coffee compartment is made from 304 food-grade stainless steel - the same material used in professional and industrial cookware and kitchens.This means your coffee is not only safe from toxic elements but will maintain its original taste. Whether you’re commuting to work, hopping between trains, or simply powering through the day, H2Joe lets you stay hydrated and energized, without compromise.Get your morning kick before your 9 am call, take a refreshing swig before a meeting, and do it all from one bottle.
      Founders: Dorothy, Brett, and John.While starting a family company back in 2012, Brett and his wife, Dorothy, fell in love with drinking coffee. But, there was one problem they didn’t anticipate… how to carry both their coffee and water around at the same time. Carrying two bottles was a hassle.Over the years, as the coffee got consumed, their new addiction gave Dorothy an idea… “someone needs to invent a bottle that holds coffee and water at the same time”.They didn’t exactly jump on a solution, but by 2017, Dorothy’s patience was running out. “Are we going to develop this coffee/water bottle or not? I need this thing in my life!”It was then that Brett introduced the idea to John, his longtime friend, and colleague. Between them, they share more than 50 years of product and marketing success, having sold $1B+ in products at wholesale for various companies. This, however, was an opportunity to build a product for themselves they were personally passionate about!The vision of creating the ultimate coffee and water bottle started in May of 2017, and after countless “cups of joe”, late nights and prototypes, has finally become a reality. On behalf of our team, we want to thank you for your support and can’t wait for you to meet H2Joe.We want to say ""Thank You"" to the following coffee fanatics who supported us along the way, helping make H2Joe a reality. We couldn’t have done it without you!",66.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are working on the ruler and the customized blade. Perfect Cut Specs More Examples Thank You for Your SupportTo everyone who backed and feedbacked the project – thank you. Your support and constructive feedback make Perfect Cut and Polarlab a reality, has changed my life, and now changing others’. The project started in Dec 2014 when I was a design student and was one of my degree projects. Moreover, now Perfect Cut got a chance to be real after years of developing and refining.This campaign is about more than designing and backing a project. It’s a business model and a good way for designers or anyone who has an idea to be evaluated and realized as a product. In term of business, crowdfunding allows us not to compromise the functionality and creativity of the product, and in this case, we could treat our communities, backers, partners and our team (of 2 people) as peers.Once again, thank you for your occupation, and we will continuously look to you, our community, for feedback and direction. Enjoy cutting :) About PolarLab  We are makers, designers, and engineers. We explore the intersection of function, beauty, and intelligence of products. We investigate how products are conceived, made, traded, and used. We believe there are ample opportunities off the well-trodden paths of design and we are out to explore them. Our process is underpinned by intellectual rigor and direct research. We are crowdfunded in 2017 after we did our 1st campaign in Taiwan. Risks and ChallengesOur team have done a crowdfunding project and successfully delivered. Although there was a delay of a month, we did give our backers full transparency into the issues and how we solved them, and we will continue doing so.However, this is our first time to make an aluminum extrusion component, and we can predict that unexpected issues can happen, so we have set some buffer on our schedule. But we are sure that we will deliver and keep you updated.",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p align=""center""><strong>Introducing Mirror Mimic:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Your Video Presentations and Training with Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>At Fused Realities, Inc. we strive to create software that increases your productivity and your capabilities. With Mirror Mimic, we want to put the power of Augmented Reality to work on your video presentations and training. This program gives you the tools to quickly and easily insert yourself into any video on Windows or Android platforms. Videos can come from a local source saved to your device or from an internet URL. All you need is a webcam and Mirror Mimic will do the rest.</p>
<p>Once your videos and webcam are added, your webcam stream will be superimposed over the video. At this point you can adjust the transparency of the webcam so that either you or the background is more visible. You can play the video back windowed or in full screen and directly follow along. Mirror Mimic also comes with an alignment tool to precisely match yourself up with a location in the video. </p>
<p>By overlaying yourself onto videos, you can give presentations that are far more personal, interactive and understandable. A great deal of human communication comes from facing who you are speaking and making eye contact with your audience. With Mirror Mimic, you can easily achieve this as you can see the presentation information yourself while still looking directly into the camera. You can point to and highlight important points while never getting in the audience’s way. Text and visuals in the background video are still clearly visible at all times while you are presenting semi transparently.</p>
<p>This transparent overlay can also bring benefits to using instructional and training videos. Mirror Mimic’s video alignment tool allows you follow along with expert videos and walkthroughs. After a short sequence where you line up the instructor in the background video with yourself in the webcam. Mirror Mimic will automatically adjust and scale the background video so that you are directly imposed over the expert in the video. Now you can mimic their movements and learn directly from a pro with instant feedback about how closely you can match their technique.. Mirror Mimic training can bring benefits to sports training, yoga, karaoke, learning sign language, dancing and almost anything else you can find with an expert video.</p>
<p><strong>The Development Campaign</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, Mirror Mimic already has a lot of functionality and benefits to bring users. The software is already developed for use on Windows and Android, and with your support we hope to bring it to iOS devices as well. Contributing to this campaign will bring the benefits of Mirror Mimic to even more people and allow you to claim some exciting rewards. All donation options include Mirror Mimic Pro. This pro version comes with all the functionality and useful features discussed with the addition of the watermark removed from the video screen. You can claim a copy for yourself for just $2, or get multiple copies for friends, family or coworkers for $10 or $20. Additionally, very generous donations will get you associated with the development and release of Mirror Mimic. A $500 donation will get you named in the program credits as an official backer. A donation of $2,000 that fully funds the campaign will make you an official sponsor and your company logo will be added to the Mirror Mimic brand as thanks for your significant contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Going Forward</strong></p>
<p>Any sort of contribution to this campaign will get even more people using and seeing the benefits Mirror Mimic brings to training and presentations. Even if you can’t donate directly, taking a few seconds to share this campaign with friends, coworkers or on social media would be essential to its success. Your support will allow us to continue developing our project with new functionality to help even more users. Even if our donation goals aren’t met in full, any funds received will go towards moving Mirror Mimic to new platforms and improving the existing software. Thanks for your time and attention, and we hope you’ll consider supporting and using Mirror Mimic.</p>

<h2>History and Future Aims</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Development of the mille-feuille system began in the summer of 2014. While receiving requests for prototypes as a hardware engineer, we noticed that a lot of time was being lost as a result of change after change being made to the design. Communicating back and forth with software engineers also took up a lot of time, and software engineers were inevitably forced to wait for operation verification on the hardware side. We realized that the speed of development could be greatly increased if the process all the way up to operation confirmation could be conducted by software engineers on their own.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">When it comes to development, speed is everything. We also believe that making things should be as simple and easy as possible. Having to read large volumes of data sheets and sample schematics in order to realize an idea will always take up more time than you have, requiring measures like the hiring of additional employees, and constitutes a huge barrier to development. It is very sad that most ideas will disappear without ever having been concretely implemented because of a lack of the funds and knowledge needed to pursue their development. We hope that people will use mille-feuille to make at least some of these ideas that would otherwise be lost a reality. We want to usher in an era in which any programmer can make their own hardware.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p>We want to develop mille-feuille into something that can be applied to education and used <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">in research institutions and industrial settings. We are eager to hear from anyone who </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">would like to collaborate with us to make this happen!</span></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">At present we are building prototypes in preparation for mass production. We have completed negotiations with a production factory, and have nearly reached the point at which mass production is possible. One risk is that, as a result of factors such as one of the parts included in the library used to generate schematics being discontinued, the development of some devices will be delayed. In such cases we will look for a replacement part and update the library, but there is a possibility that shipping will be delayed for several months.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When the schematics generated by mille-feuille are used to create a PCB layout, factors such as noise make it impossible for exactly the same signal to be input and output, and so some differences may arise depending on the person doing the PCB artwork.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A Raspberry Pi A+, B+ or 2 is not included. You should also download EAGLE CAD yourself according to your own use case. The automatic schematic creation tool can be used free of charge by those who purchase mille-feuille.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This campaign will take us as far as developing the schematic creation tool. Going forward, we plan to let users develop and sell original device boards that other users can connect to mille-feuille. We are also working towards including address numbers for use by third parties issued by mille-feuille on the ROM, and making it possible to register schematics on the mille-feuille server.</span></p>

<p>ハードウェア制作に必要なプロセスをmille -feuilleひとつで<br/></p>
<p>mille-feuille（ミルフィーユ）はハードウェアの知識がなくても、ハードエンジニアのように回路図と専用ファームウェアまで自動生成できるサポートツールです(生成される回路にはmille-feuille自体の回路は含んでいないため、普通に配線したような回路図が生成されます)。Raspberry
Pi A+、B+、2に接続して使います。</p>
<p></p>
<p>自動配線機能により半田付けの作業はなく、ハードウェアを動かすためのファームウェアもすべてmille-feuilleがやってくれます。ユーザーは簡単な動作のPHPやpythonプログラムを書くだけ<a href=""http://www.mille-feuille.mcugear.com/phpSample.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[PHP sample]</a>　<a href=""http://www.mille-feuille.mcugear.com/phpSample.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.mille-feuille.mcugear.com/pythonSample.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[Python sample]</a>。最後は回路図自動生成ツールを使ってmille-feuilleに接続されているデバイスの情報をサーバーにアップロードします。サーバーで生成されたEagle CAD Script データをCADにインポートすれば、mille-feuille独自の回路を取り除いた、Raspberry Pi とデバイスを普通に配線したような回路図が自動で生成されます。</p>
<p>mille-feuilleが皆さんのハードエンジニアとして、試作開発をスムーズにします。</p>

[PHP sample] 　[Python sample] 
Complete all processes necessary to produce hardware using only mille-feuille. Mille-feuille is a support tool that allows even someone with no previous knowledge of hardware to automatically create electronic schematics and specialized firmware (The created schematic does not contain the circuits of the mille-feuille device itself). It is used in connection with a Raspberry Pi A+, B+ or 2.With its automatic wiring function, mille-feuille sets up everything for you without any need for soldering – including firmware used to operate your hardware. All the user has to do is write an simple operation program in PHP or Python without difficult firmware.[PHP sample] 　[Python sample] The last step is to use the automatic schematic creation tool and upload information about the device connected to mille-feuille to our server. A schematic for wiring the Raspberry Pi and device, without the mille-feuille’s own circuits, is then created when you import the EAGLE CAD Script generated by the server into your CAD application.Mille-feuille serves as your hardware engineer, and makes prototype development easy for everyone.

Components



15 types of device board

To begin with there will be 15 types of device board:



Open source software and open hardware (Device board)

Automatically generated schematics that do not include mille-feuille’s automatic wiring function can be freely used as open hardware and open source software.PatentsA patent on the mille-feuille system has been obtained in the United States. Applications for patents in other countries have been filed.
Target




For WEB programmers
 Mille-feuille makes it possible for programmers to create prototypes just by layering circuits, and since it also lets them automatically generate custom schematics and specialized firmware, mille-feuille enables programmers to quickly complete pre-production prototypes without having to involve hardware engineers.For hardware engineers: Speed up hardware design
Mille-feuille enables hardware engineers to respond to design changes just by replacing modules. It also makes it easy to output schematic outlines.

Development example


Detail of mille-feuille boards







Automatic wiring function
1. When mille-feuille is initialized, it establishes what devices are connected and where based on the ID number saved on the device board’s ROM and the confirmation signal from the module boards.

2. Multiple multiplexer* circuits (digital swtches) are installed on mille-feuille’s baseboard for wiring switching. Wiring can be carried out in accordance with the device board being used.(*Multiplexer is just digital switches, Users do not use like FPGA Verilog. It is completely different. )
3. The mille-feuille module board is equipped with a quad bus switch. By opening a bus, a connection to the designated device can be wired. This makes it possible to connect to only the designated device even when multiple module boards are vertically stacked.





Automatic Schematic Creation Tool
This tool creates a schematic and corresponding firmware (fixed wire) that does not include any of the circuits involved in mille-feuille's own automatic wiring function.
The mille-feuille software application determines what devices are connected. This information is then uploaded to the mille-feuille servers. An optimal schematic and corresponding firmware are then automatically generated on the server. The schematic can then be automatically drawn once it is imported into EAGLE CAD. It is possible to do the PCB artwork corresponding to the board you want to use on the completed schematic yourself, and since the schematic can be used as a specification it is also possible to have someone else do the PCB artwork for you.



The created schematic does not contain the circuits of the mille-feuille device itself.

History and Future Aims
Development of the mille-feuille system began in the summer of 2014. While receiving requests for prototypes as a hardware engineer, we noticed that a lot of time was being lost as a result of change after change being made to the design. Communicating back and forth with software engineers also took up a lot of time, and software engineers were inevitably forced to wait for operation verification on the hardware side. We realized that the speed of development could be greatly increased if the process all the way up to operation confirmation could be conducted by software engineers on their own.
When it comes to development, speed is everything. We also believe that making things should be as simple and easy as possible. Having to read large volumes of data sheets and sample schematics in order to realize an idea will always take up more time than you have, requiring measures like the hiring of additional employees, and constitutes a huge barrier to development. It is very sad that most ideas will disappear without ever having been concretely implemented because of a lack of the funds and knowledge needed to pursue their development. We hope that people will use mille-feuille to make at least some of these ideas that would otherwise be lost a reality. We want to usher in an era in which any programmer can make their own hardware.

Collaborators welcom


We want to develop mille-feuille into something that can be applied to education and used in research institutions and industrial settings. We are eager to hear from anyone who would like to collaborate with us to make this happen!

Risks & Challenges

At present we are building prototypes in preparation for mass production. We have completed negotiations with a production factory, and have nearly reached the point at which mass production is possible. One risk is that, as a result of factors such as one of the parts included in the library used to generate schematics being discontinued, the development of some devices will be delayed. In such cases we will look for a replacement part and update the library, but there is a possibility that shipping will be delayed for several months.
When the schematics generated by mille-feuille are used to create a PCB layout, factors such as noise make it impossible for exactly the same signal to be input and output, and so some differences may arise depending on the person doing the PCB artwork.
A Raspberry Pi A+, B+ or 2 is not included. You should also download EAGLE CAD yourself according to your own use case. The automatic schematic creation tool can be used free of charge by those who purchase mille-feuille.
This campaign will take us as far as developing the schematic creation tool. Going forward, we plan to let users develop and sell original device boards that other users can connect to mille-feuille. We are also working towards including address numbers for use by third parties issued by mille-feuille on the ROM, and making it possible to register schematics on the mille-feuille server.



The system design requires multiple addresses to be prepared when the same type of device boards are connected to a single baseboard. At present we are not sure how many devices of the same type it will be possible to connect.


FAQ
Q: What about the shipping fee and customs duties?

We plan to use EMS for overseas shipping. Within Japan we will ship using Japan Post.Please confirm in advance whether EMS delivery to your location is possible using the website below. If delivery is not possible, please specify another location for EMS delivery to be received.Japan Post (https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/ems/country/all_en.html)

In some countries customs duties may be required in addition to the shipping fee. In such cases you are responsible for following the customs procedures in your country and paying any duties owed.
Shipping fee:  Worldwide $15 , Japan $5

要約

[PHP sample] 　[Python sample]
ハードウェア制作に必要なプロセスをmille -feuilleひとつで
mille-feuille（ミルフィーユ）はハードウェアの知識がなくても、ハードエンジニアのように回路図と専用ファームウェアまで自動生成できるサポートツールです(生成される回路にはmille-feuille自体の回路は含んでいないため、普通に配線したような回路図が生成されます)。Raspberry
Pi A+、B+、2に接続して使います。

自動配線機能により半田付けの作業はなく、ハードウェアを動かすためのファームウェアもすべてmille-feuilleがやってくれます。ユーザーは簡単な動作のPHPやpythonプログラムを書くだけ[PHP sample]　[Python sample]。最後は回路図自動生成ツールを使ってmille-feuilleに接続されているデバイスの情報をサーバーにアップロードします。サーバーで生成されたEagle CAD Script データをCADにインポートすれば、mille-feuille独自の回路を取り除いた、Raspberry Pi とデバイスを普通に配線したような回路図が自動で生成されます。
mille-feuilleが皆さんのハードエンジニアとして、試作開発をスムーズにします。
構成


15種類のデバイスボード
最初は15種類のデバイスボードを用意します。

デバイスボードはオープンハードです。自動生成されたmille-feuilleの自動配線機能が含まれていない回路図はオープンハードとして自由に使えます。ファームウェアはオープンソースです。
特許
mille-feuille の仕組みは米国特許を取得しました。また、各国に出願中です。
ターゲットWEB プログラマ向け
プログラマにとっては回路を重ねるだけで試作ができて、さらにカスタム回路図と、その専用のファームウェアまで自動生成できるので、ハードエンジニアとのやり取りがなくても量産前の試作回路図までスピーディーに完成します。
ハードウェアエンジニアにとって: ハードウェア設計のスピードアップハードエンジニアにとってはモジュールを入れ替えるだけで仕様変更がすぐ対応できます。また、簡単に回路図のアウトラインが出力できます。（今回はRaspberry Pi 用ですが追々増やしていきたいと思います。）

開発例

mille-feuille board　の詳細


自動配線機能
1. mille-feuilleは初期化の時に、Device boardのROMに保存されているＩＤ番号と、モジュール基板からの確認信号を基に、どこにどのデバイスが存在するのかを把握できます。

2. mille-feuilleのBaseboardには配線をスイッチングするための複数のMultiplexer回路*が搭載されています。使うDevice boardに合わせて配線することができます。(*Multiplexer はただのデジタルスイッチです。ユーザーがＦＰＧＡの複雑なVerilogなどを使って書き換えなどの操作はありません。多くのハードウェアエンジニアが勘違いしやすいです。)
3. mille-feuilleのModule board にはQuad bus switchが搭載されています。バスを開くことで、特定のデバイスに配線を接続することができます。これにより、複数のModule Boardを縦に積み重ねても、特定のデバイスだけに接続することができます。



回路図自動生成ツール
このツールはmille-feuille の自動配線機能を省いた回路図と、それに合わせたファームウェア生成されます。
専用アプリケーションを使い、どのデバイスが接続されているかを把握します。その情報をmille-feuille専用サーバーにアップロードします。サーバーではその時の最適な回路図と、それに合わせたファームウェアを自動的に生成してくれます。　生成されたデータをEAGLE CADにインポートすれば回路図が自動で描かれます。完成した回路図を作りたい基板に合わせて自分でアートワークをすることも可能ですし、回路図を仕様書としても使えるので、誰かにアートワークをしてもらうこともできます。



生成される回路にはmille-feuille自体の回路は含んでいないため、普通に配線したような回路図が生成されます。

small but enthusiastic group of professionals passionate about the endless possibilities our digital era provides us.
We all work in different areas but are ultimately united by a single idea, to share our knowledge and experience in the easiest way possible. For us this is:
–we believe
that words are definitely important, but when everything else around us is constantly moving at volatile speeds, words themselves may become a less efficient frequency of sharing information. 

And sometimes less words means more meaning.  So thus we say:


“Less Words – More Design”


This guidebook is 100% intended to be only the greatest of help to anyone and everyone wanting to design an iOS application.


It will help you to verify the app structure and lead you through the stages of designing your very own app.  



– What kind of skills do you need? – None!
In fact, Less Words – More Design is our abiding motto that aims to teach both beginners and experts giving all both basic level and advanced design knowledge used by professionals. 

Even the most average of Joes can create and design with our guidebook, as we provide you with a kit of all components, including: 



You can change the size, color and maintain image quality required for Retina screens.




And no fret concerning the new iOS8, as our book will include all innovations of it.




And here’s just one more useful tidbit:







Our book is formatted and available for your computer, tablet and smartphone! 


This gives you the opportunity to learn anywhere and everywhere, from Timbuctoo to any given underground subway, or right from your very own home! 


How can you help?



Contribute.Any contribution amount makes a huge difference. Just check out our perks and find the one that best suits you. 


Spread the word.Sharing links takes a few seconds and helps to raise awareness dramatically. The more people that know about us, the more they will be willing to contribute. 



Why do we need your help?
We have already started our work. 
We gathered information and systematized it. We have even found designers to 
compose this guidebook and prepare its complementary kit with components. 


So now all we need is your help to make it all happen and come to life!

With your contributions, we will be able to fund and plan accordingly, so that our team can rise to excellency, and most importantly,

Discounted for a limited time and shipping in November! Introducing Sketchboard Pro, an iPad stand designed for artists by artists!   Modeled after the classic illustration sketch boards we all know from art school, this stand cradles your iPad to create a totally flat drawing surface around the screen and allow for more comfort and support while drawing. Draw Better and Feel BetterThe Sketchboard Pro can be used flat on a drawing table or propped against a desk, or in your lap on the couch and in bed, and it has legs that fold out to create a comfortable 20-degree incline on any flat surface in landscape or portrait orientation.   
The flat surface surrounding the screen creates a resting space for hands and maximizes canvas space.
 

 
No longer having to hold the iPad with one hand while drawing frees up tension and relaxes your body allowing you to pour more energy into your creativity!
 

 
Flat, paper-like surface provides smoother transitions for elegant line work.

Rather than confining your drawing to one small portion of the screen where you aren't resting your hand, you now have the entire canvas to work with!
 

 
And not only will you start to DRAW bigger, but you'll begin to THINK bigger!
  Draw and paint wherever you are most comfortable and love to work and for longer periods of time without punishing your body! What Our Backers Are Saying ""I'm quite excited for this...I can't wait for this board to make my constant working experience even better.

 Just Like Drawing on Paper
 With the Sketchboard Pro, your iPad is nestled into a form-fitted cradle that creates a smooth surface for your hand to glide across. For the first time, this enables you to utilize the complete canvas when drawing on your iPad, rather than resting your hand on areas of the screen where you could be drawing. 
 
 Bring Your Drawings to Life! 

 Combine what you love about drawing on iPad with the traditional physical experience of making art. You are able to use your full arm while drawing to achieve a more elegant, flowing look to your lines and bring your drawings to life. 
 Sketchboard Pro offers wonderful support for arms so you can rest 'em when you need to and store that energy for when you need crazy arm motion in your lines. 
 We have found that many artists who draw on their iPads for extended periods of time hold a lot of tension in their bodies from the positions they have to maintain while drawing. Thanks to the Sketchboard Pro, your whole body can relax and that positive feeling translates to your art.  It's Got a Magnetic Personality 
 Magnetic plates embedded in the Sketchboard Pro help to lock your iPad Pro in place to prevent it from accidentally falling out when you need to move from one spot to the next. Charge While You Draw  Although our earlier prototypes do not show it, our final Sketchboard Pro has a port for your charging cable so you can keep your iPad happy and powerful during long drawing sessions! Stand in Landscape or Portrait Orientation
 Additional fold-out legs enable Sketchboard Pro to stand in portrait or landscape orientation with flat resting surfaces for righties and lefties! Available for Most Apple Pencil Supported iPads! Sketchboard Pro models are available for all iPads with Apple Pencil support except for the iPad Mini. Supported models:

These artists are drawing on their iPads with the Apple Pencil for several hours a day. We gave each of them a prototype to test drive for several weeks and were so happy to learn that they now can't live without Sketchboard Pro.

The shipping costs you are seeing there now are the best rates we could find for a box with the dimensions for the Sketchboard Pro to your country. We will continue to develop our fulfillment relationships and if we are able to get a better rate at the time of shipment, we will refund you the difference.  Production Update! May 2020 Our large moulds are finally finished tooling and delivered to the factory. Production samples are being produced! June 2020 Untextured production samples received! 

 

July 2020 Final production models received and products are being prepared for shipment to the states! ABOUT US  Braintreehouse is an art studio where we make art and games. We successfully Kickstarted a card game last year that is now being published by Chronicle for worldwide distribution and we’re hard at work on our first video game. We developed the Sketchboard Pro by necessity while making art for our games. Our engineering partner is Rocketship. They are a team of excellent industrial designers who have developed products in dozens of industries. Their clients include Blendtec, Pelican, Philips, Nalgene, and Easton. Rocketship has guided us throughout our design and prototyping phases and will continue to help us through our DFM and manufacturing phases.  *All royalty-free music in our videos provided by Bensound*",31.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Productivity is not about managing your time as much as it is about managing your mind. Often we intend to work on a task, but distractions and interruptions scatter our focus. <i>hellomindful.me </i>app offers a solution.</p>
<p><strong>The solution?</strong> To bring mindfulness to the workplace.</p>
<p><strong>How? </strong>With a mindfulness at work method.</p>
<p><i>hellomindful.me </i>sharpens your focus on the present. The application puts into practice a method of mindfulness at work which involves setting intentions, knowing what you are doing at all times, and focusing on one task for sustainable increments of time.</p>
<p>This method of mindfulness at work has been in design for more than several years by Pierre Khawand, productivity and leadership thought leader and founder of <a href=""http://www.people-onthego.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">People-OnTheGo</a>. Khawand trains and coaches working professionals on how to navigate today’s fast-paced workplace and how to manage the constant interruptions and information overload that leaves professionals scattered and stressed. He draws from 15 years of experience and research in workplace productivity in creating this method.</p>
<p>Just last year Khawand released the journal and pen “analog” version of the method, published as <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-15-Minute-Day-Managing-Thoughts/dp/1532783817"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Perfect 15-Minute Day Method (PDM)</a>. It received great reviews. Users asked for a mobile version, so Khawand began developing what is now the prototype of the <i> </i><i>hellomindful</i><i>.</i><i>me</i> web app.</p>
<p>Funding for this campaign will go towards building out both the mobile and web applications of <i>hellomindful.me </i>in order for both apps to have more comprehensive features.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The App: Mindfulness at Work</h2>
<p>So, how will the <i>hellomindful.me </i>app bring mindfulness to your workday? The app will help you to do the following:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Focus on the NOW  </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518049187/bhoofdn6cx72of7uqz5r.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518049239/yebp0dwbu7pfvizzrihj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>NOW is where you and the app live.</p>
<p>Make an intention for what you want to do during the next 15 minutes (or a time increment of your choice), and do it! This will help you work assertively rather than reactively for a concrete amount of time.</p>
<p>The NOW screen will remind you of your current task in case you get distracted or interrupted. A gentle sound will mark the end of your focus session and will provide you with a checkpoint and options to continue or switch your current task or take a mindful break.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Take Mindful Breaks</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518049268/mah4epe6ydh7spqsm6qs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A Mindful Break is a moment to recharge your mind and body so you can stay engaged and avoid burning out at work. It is similar to the NOW page, but both the activity name and timer are optional as you may or may not want your break to be timed.</p>
<p>A goal for the new iteration of the <i>hellomindful.me</i> app is to remind the user to take a Mindful Break after a given number of focus sessions and suggest activities of your choice. For instance, if you’re at the desk for long hours, it could regularly prompt you to stand, stretch, or take a walk.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Reflect on Your Day </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518049463/l4t0ng82f6b5aq0s6uua.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>hellomindful.me</i> keeps a record of your activity so you can honestly evaluate and reflect on how you spend your time. You can see completed or incomplete tasks as well as how you approach your work. Do you tend to jump back and forth between tasks or do you work on a single task for hours and forget to take breaks? Maybe you spent longer than expected on certain tasks, or devoted too much time to less important tasks.</p>
<p>A stretch goal for the new iteration of the <i>hellomindful.me</i> app is to report insightful analytics that show larger user trends, such as how long certain repeated tasks take to complete, what time of day or day of the week you seem least or most focused, how long on average you work without breaks, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Capture Stray Thoughts and Interruptions</strong></h3>
<p>Capture is a place to capture stray thoughts and ideas so that you can return to the task at hand, the NOW. Having an in-app place to take notes helps the user avoid risking further distraction from opening other apps. Plus, with the intention of minimizing distractions, Capture will always provide a blank space so that previous captures don’t distract you either.</p>
<p>Capture will be a new feature of the app that your contributions will help make real.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Set Goals for Each Day </strong></h3>
<p><i>hellomindful.me</i> is all about taking on each day one day at a time, 15 minutes at a time. While we set intentions for each focus session, we also need to set goals for the day to remind us where to spend our focus and energy. The Today page allows you to list these goals. It’s not intended to be an exhaustive to-do list, but a small list of your top tasks to accomplish with room for the unexpected. Checking off these Today tasks will be specially noted in your activity log.</p>
<p>The Today feature will be also be a new feature of <i>hellomindful.me </i>thanks to your contribution.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Acknowledge Your Accomplishments and Rate Your Engagement</strong></h3>
<p>So often we accomplish one thing and immediately look towards the next task to do. To find satisfaction in our work it’s important to acknowledge our accomplishments, no matter how small. <i>hellomindful.me</i> app gives you a hoorah whenever you check off a task as completed.</p>
<p>A stretch goal for <i>hellomindful.me</i> is a feature that allows you to rate your engagement and energy level in tasks. Inspired by Bill Burnett and Dave Evan’s book <i>Designing Your Life</i>, keeping track of your engagement and energy level throughout your workday will reveal what you truly enjoy about your job and allow you to seek more of that in your daily work.</p>
<h2><strong>What Makes the <i>hellomindful.me </i>App Unique</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike many of the productivity apps available in stores that help you manage your time, <i>hellomindful.me </i>helps you manage your mind by allowing you to quickly capture your internal distractions (a.k.a. thoughts); by reminding you to acknowledge your accomplishments and take breaks to recharge; and by facilitating your practice of setting goals and intentions each day, throughout your day. This way you can be not only productive but also happy at work.</p>
<p>The <i>hellomindful.me </i>app stands on a tried and true mindfulness at work method. The app will facilitate the practice of the method, with the added advantage of being digital -- it can remind you to recharge and reflect, it can track your activities and inform you of your work habits, and it can follow you away from the desk.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Our Budget</h2>
<p>Your contributions will go towards funding the first release of the <i>hellomindful.me</i> app for both web and mobile. With your help we will improve the current web-app prototype (seen in the above screenshots), as well as build out the cross-platform mobile version, Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Our goal for this first release of the <i>hellomindful.me</i> app is to have all the basic features, as described above, functioning smoothly. Our funding goal of $20,000 is our budget to accomplish this (front-end, back-end, database, UI/UX design, testing, etc.). There are, however, several features and functionalities we would love to include, and could, given extra funds. These are our stretch-goals.</p>
<h3><b>Stretch Goals</b></h3>
<p><b>If We Reach $25,000</b></p>
<p>We will add the Rate Your Engagement feature that allows you to rate your engagement and energy level in tasks to reveal what you truly enjoy about your work and encourage you to seek more of that in your daily work.</p>
<p><strong>If We Reach $35,000</strong></p>
<p>We will be able to sync the app and user data across devices.</p>
<p><strong>If We Reach $45,000 </strong></p>
<p>We will add more advanced analytics that informs the user of their work habits, such as how long certain repeated tasks take to complete, what time of day or day of the week you seem the least or most focused, how long on average you work without breaks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>If We Reach $50,000+</strong></p>
<p>We will integrate the app with other productivity apps such as e-mail and calendar apps.</p>

The only issue that may present a challenge -- a challenge we hope to have -- is the issue of scalability of the app to support heavy user demand. This we hope to mitigate through extensive beta testing assisted by our campaign contributors.

</h3><p>Okay, think about what goes wrong in your average brainstorm:</p><p>- People act politically correct, and don't say what comes to mind first.<br/>- There's too little time<br/>- Quiet people are afraid people are going to shoot off their ideas<br/>- People seem to get stuck at the same ideas.<br/>- The brainstorm becomes a drag, and you settle for an okayish idea in the end.</p><p>Our 100 Brain Fuel cards let you look at your problem from a totally different perspective. This makes brainstorming fun again, but most importantly: Brain Fuel will break through your standard thought patterns, so it will be easy to come up with unusual associations. You will gain access to a whole new range of solutions, and your okay ideas will turn into great ones!   </p><h3><strong>Tell me more about the cards!</strong></h3><p>Okay, you asked for it! Brain Fuel has 4 categories:</p><p>1. Animals, 2. Characters,  3. Objects,  4. Locations</p><p>Some categories work perfectly with one brainstorm technique, some categories work well with others.

Okay, think about what goes wrong in your average brainstorm:- People act politically correct, and don't say what comes to mind first.- There's too little time- Quiet people are afraid people are going to shoot off their ideas- People seem to get stuck at the same ideas.- The brainstorm becomes a drag, and you settle for an okayish idea in the end.Our 100 Brain Fuel cards let you look at your problem from a totally different perspective. This makes brainstorming fun again, but most importantly: Brain Fuel will break through your standard thought patterns, so it will be easy to come up with unusual associations. You will gain access to a whole new range of solutions, and your okay ideas will turn into great ones!   Tell me more about the cards!Okay, you asked for it! Brain Fuel has 4 categories:1. Animals, 2. Characters,  3. Objects,  4. LocationsSome categories work perfectly with one brainstorm technique, some categories work well with others. Maybe we will add even more categories in the future (at least we hope so: see our first stretchgoal).Choose your brainstorming methodWe added ten brainstorming-methods that ignite your imagination, so you can come up with new solutions for your problems. Some of the methods are golden oldies and others are brand new. We even developed some of them on our own (don't worry, we have a brainstorming expert in our team)! The methods differ in difficulty and the amount of creativity needed.Because there are countless possibilities we want to add two new methods with each and every stretch goal!Proof of conceptOne simply doesn’t develop a tool out of thin air. Research, testing, more research, more tests, and so forth and so on! As of now, more than 1250 people have tested Brain Fuel. Most of them live in our homeland, the Netherlands, but we were also very honoured that people from all over the world helped to test our product. <3 They gave us new insights on the design, the card choice, techniques etc. We used their feedback to improve Brain Fuel to what is now in front of you!  Choose between an app or the cards (or use both)We are there for lovers of technology and lovers of paper! The card game is tailormade for brainstorms with a group of people and with the app (iOS and Android) you'll always have Brain Fuel nearby for a quick and powerful brainstorm.  Help us helpWhen we came to the conclusion that we invented something that did not exist yet and in which we truly believe, we thought: why keep this to ourselves? Our industry? Of even our country? Why not share it with as many people as possible? And that is exactly what we are planning to do. Why do we need your moneyWe've already had a succesful Kickstarter campaign where we reached 140% of our goal. And that's fantastic! Because with that money we are able to print the first batch of cards and produce the packaging. (Those are being pressed right now). But for us it's not just about the cards, we're trying to build an entire Brain Fuel community. And that's why we came to Indiegogo. We need your help people! With your money we will be able to:+ Finish the apps we are building + Get the webshop ready to sell Brain Fuel + Make sure everything is ready to reach an international audienceLike we said: we already managed to raise more than 11KAfter this, Brain Fuel will be ready for our webshop and we will do our best to get Brain Fuel available in stores. The estimated retailprice will be $32,- for one deck of Brain Fuel, the short cut instructions and 10 step-by-step worksheets. The app will be available for free with selected categories and a couple of methods. Extra categories and methods will be available through in-app purchases.RewardsBecause we really want to do something extra for the people that give us something extra.. we decided to reward higher perks with some nifty gifts! So besides the app, the cards and our unconditional love you'll receive:+ Idea Generator Poster. This poster is one of the extras you'll receive when you buy a perk of $42 or more. This awesome piece of paper helps you with brainstorming when you don't have the cards or the app nearby. Or just hang it in your office to show off.+ Step-by-step Worksheets.+ A (digital) Brain Fuel Masterclass. + Your own personalized card in the Brain Fuel deck (not in the app). + Together with us, you design a new card for Brain Fuel. We add this to the deck so every users can use your card!We also offer three perks that are specifically compiled for facilitators/trainers, teachers, and business(wo)men.

<p>Torchlight Intelligence is an A.I. company with the goal of bringing the power of modern articifial intelligence to you. Our premiere service, Emberlight, is an A.I. that is designed to write your reports, papers, speeches, essays, and other creative works for you. Emberlight will be the cornerstone for our work, bringing modern A.I. to the home and workplace for everyday use — and we have made it simple enough that anyone regardless of age or technical skill can use it. Given 2 or 3 sentences of context, the A.I. is capable of understanding the intent of what you want to say and elaborates on it.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As it stands, Emberlight is too powerful to run on anything less than a supercomputer. We have built a service using supercomputer resources to serve Emberlight in the cloud. While these cloud resources are not prohibitively expensive, there is a significant cost associated with them that inevitably translates to a higher price in the final product. With your support, we can build our own machines and serve Emberlight ourselves for little more than the price of electricity. This would allow us to dramatically reduce the cost to our users.</p>
<p>The successful launch of Emberlight is our top priority. Once launch has been guaranteed, we seek to offer our service at the most affordable price possible. This means building infrastructure with our own hardware that performs well under high demand.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal: $12,000.00. This would allow us to build a minimally serviceable network capable of delivering a consistent stream rate of 7-20 words per second to our clients.</li>
<li>Stretch Goal: $80,000.00. This would provide the financial bedrock needed to perform independent research and development to expand beyond our base service. Furthermore, we would be able to construct a truly top-of-the-line network. With this kind of power, we could serve rapid-fire responses to large numbers of users simultaneously.</li>
<li>Monthly expenses: We will need to rent a secure space for our hardware, insure that hardware, pay for electricity, cloud-based processing (as needed), and maintain a high-bandwidth, symmetric internet connection.</li>
<li>If our goal is not reached, we still intend on attempting to bring the project forward, but on an extended release timeline and at a higher cost to users.</li>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Torchlight Intelligence is an A.I. company with the goal of bringing the power of modern articifial intelligence to you. Our premiere service, Emberlight, is an A.I. that is designed to write your reports, papers, speeches, essays, and other creative works for you. Emberlight will be the cornerstone for our work, bringing modern A.I. to the home and workplace for everyday use — and we have made it simple enough that anyone regardless of age or technical skill can use it. Given 2 or 3 sentences of context, the A.I. is capable of understanding the intent of what you want to say and elaborates on it.
 


 
What We Need & What You Get
As it stands, Emberlight is too powerful to run on anything less than a supercomputer. We have built a service using supercomputer resources to serve Emberlight in the cloud. While these cloud resources are not prohibitively expensive, there is a significant cost associated with them that inevitably translates to a higher price in the final product. With your support, we can build our own machines and serve Emberlight ourselves for little more than the price of electricity. This would allow us to dramatically reduce the cost to our users.
The successful launch of Emberlight is our top priority. Once launch has been guaranteed, we seek to offer our service at the most affordable price possible. This means building infrastructure with our own hardware that performs well under high demand.

Goal: $12,000.00. This would allow us to build a minimally serviceable network capable of delivering a consistent stream rate of 7-20 words per second to our clients.
Stretch Goal: $80,000.00. This would provide the financial bedrock needed to perform independent research and development to expand beyond our base service. Furthermore, we would be able to construct a truly top-of-the-line network. With this kind of power, we could serve rapid-fire responses to large numbers of users simultaneously.
Monthly expenses: We will need to rent a secure space for our hardware, insure that hardware, pay for electricity, cloud-based processing (as needed), and maintain a high-bandwidth, symmetric internet connection.
If our goal is not reached, we still intend on attempting to bring the project forward, but on an extended release timeline and at a higher cost to users.

<h1><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">What is it?</span></strong></h1>
<p>The NeuroScienceAccelerator is an online service for brain science researchers which will help them find cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia, Parkinson’s and other brain illnesses <strong>faster</strong>. The NeuroScienceAccelerator is for EEG researchers initially and provides them with five valuable time and money saving  services:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Data cleaning</strong> (all EEG data must be cleaned and the NeuroScienceAccelerator provides an automated process for this.)</li>
<li> <strong>Proprietary artifact removal  validation model</strong> (so that it can assure only noise was removed and not brain function data)</li>
<li>
<strong>Brain function model</strong>. (Our revolutionary brain function modeling system MOST can produce models of brain function that researches have never had available prior to the launch of the NeuroScienceAccelerator.</li>
<li>
<strong>Load</strong> algorithms into the system. (The NeuroScienceAccelerator will enable researchers to upload their algorithms and data so that other researchers have access to them for <strong>experimental replication</strong> which is key to finding clues to cures)</li>
<li>
<strong>Brain Function Library</strong> (The NeuroScienceAccelerator acts as a brain function library with an ever growing brain function data set classified by stimulus to enable large data set research).</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center""><strong>It’s all about cooperation, sharing and crowd sourcing!</strong></p>
<br style=""color: #ff6600;""/><p>The Neuroscience Research Accelerator is an new way of addressing brain science research challenges through using an Internet data processing portal. Existing research procedures for extracting information from data and then organically having multiple labs do replication studies is a slow process. We need to move faster to address the growing global crisis in brain health. We're using advanced technology and the Internet to help.

<p><strong>How the NeuroScienceAccelerator helps find cures and treatments FASTER:</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""NeuroAccelerator process"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abvsciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/12-steps-to-brain-health.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""How It Works""/></p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<h1><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Your Contribution</span></strong></h1>
<p>When you make a contribution we give you data processing time on the Neuroscience Research Accelerator at the rate of one minute per dollar donated. You can assign your new Neuroscience Research Accelerator processing time to the investigation of your choice or use it for your own research project.  The following projects: </p>
<p>(1) Alzheimer's,</p>
<p>(2) Schizophrenia/Bipolar disorder,</p>
<p>(3) Auditory Processing Disorders</p>
<p>are investigations are awaiting time on the NeuroAccelerator. For more information about contributions, see our video describing <a href=""http://youtu.be/iKQrQsBnWxA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">how you fund a project of your choice</a>.</p>
<p>After your contribution we will send you a request so you can specify to which investigation you would like to give your processing time.</p>
<p>The average experiment contains between 2000 and 5000 minutes of data that must be processed.</p>
<p><strong>1. Alzheimer’s Disease</strong></p>
<p>Canadian researchers in Montreal at a research institution called the INRS in conjunction with researchers at the University of Victoria are collaborating on a project to combine promising new Alzheimer’s detection methods with data mining methods developed at the University of Victoria. Their goal is to create a sensitive, selective, and reliable detector for identifying early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. These researchers will be using the NeuroscienceAccelerator to remove artefacts from their data and to determine what brain function characteristics best reveal mild cognitive impairment leading to Alzheimer’s. Once they have built their detector, the NeuroscienceAccelerator will be used to make the detector easily available to other Alzheimer’s researchers to do replication studies to ultimately determine the reliability of the detector. Researchers doing replication studies will submit their data, test the detector, and publish their results. New data will be aggregated on the NeuroScienceAccelerator, the detection algorithm will be improved based on new data, and new replication studies can take place to test new versions of the algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>2. Schizophrenia/Bipolar disorder</strong></p>
<p>Established researchers at the University of California, Irvine, USA have collected data in a study to reveal markers for two types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from a group of healthy individuals.  These researchers are currently awaiting time on the NeuroScienceAccelerator to remove artefacts from their data, use the new data they have collected to test a marker detection idea they created in prior research, and to enhance their marker detection idea using a procedure of brain source localization to improve the selectivity of their marker detection process in distinguishing between types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from healthy individuals.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Auditory Processing</strong></p>
<p>Researchers in the UK are looking for ways that EEG methods might be used in a standard procedure to identify auditory processing dysfunction in children early.</p>
<p>In a pilot study assessing auditory processing disorders, they found that children with suspected auditory processing issues had different brain activities relating to auditory processing than age-matched controls. Their sample size for the study was small and they need a larger replication study to increase confidence in their finding.  Researchers who choose to replicate this study will use the data cleaning and peak detection algorithms available on the NeuroScienceAccelerator and can enhance the original methodology using the data mining capabilities of the accelerator.</p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Did you know:</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2012, the direct costs of caring for those with Alzheimer’s to American society will total an estimated $200 billion, including $140 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>Unless something is done, the costs of Alzheimer’s in 2050 are estimated to total $1.1 trillion (in today’s dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid will increase nearly 500 percent.</p>
<p>AND that's only one disease! Globally, brain-related illness generates more healthcare related costs and lost income than any other area of health: an estimated $2.0 trillion annually worldwide and $1.3 trillion annually in the U.S.</p>
<p>We believe there is a role for crowdsourcing brain health research and we're putting our technology on the line, so to speak, to work with global researchers, and funders like yourself who view innovation in healthcare as a route to discovering causes, cures, and treatments. So far a significant amount of neuroscience and healthcare research has been slow to find implementation, and become main-stream processes. We believe it is time to bring promising brain science out of the closet and to use new techniques and technologies to accelerate the processes.</p>
<p>The Neuroscience Research Accelerator is an online portal which will enable brain science researchers using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain function data to access state of the art data cleaning, validation processes and analysis techniques so that they can get the most from the data they collect and do it in as short a time as possible. Not only are we crowd funding this portal, but we're going to crowd source brain science research data from around the globe by providing a useful service to researchers for as *low a cost as possible and for many of them for free.</p>
<p>(*A small fee per use will be required outside of special free service arrangements for us to maintain the infrastructure and support a sustainable business model.)</p>
<p>In this new paradigm for research, we can do research faster and smarter by using these new technologies.</p>
<p>We have a road-map of milestones to build the remaining technology to help us help researchers and eventually our health systems to identify dementias, diseases, and disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, and Epilepsy early. Early detection will help researchers investigate cures and potentially understand causes.</p>
<p>We can do this with your help.</p>
<h1><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">The Impact</span></strong></h1>
<p>The Neuroscience Research Accelerator (that we've nicknamed the NeuroScienceAccelerator<sup>TM</sup>) will help the neuroscience research community in their search for better treatments, better pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies for the major brain related illnesses of our day.</p>
<p>It does this through: providing a centralized method for data cleaning and processing, adding data to a central brain function library, containing data-driven models of how our brains transfer and process information which all researchers can share. This assists neuroscience research by bringing crowd data to advanced technology for understanding the brain and combining this with learning algorithms that process large amounts of data.</p>
<p>This new approach to neuroscience research will:</p>
<p>(1) provide online easy-to-use sophisticated brain function analysis tools to neuroscience investigators who would normally have to hire a technology expert,</p>
<p>(2) support replication of major brain illness research by making custom data analysis available in an easy-to-use automated form to new researchers doing replication studies,</p>
<p>(3) aggregate data collected from multiple researchers to generate robust data-driven brain function models and statistics, and identify weak but relevant findings in the data, and</p>
<p>(4) make it possible to build a growing aggregate data library for building brain function models which will be available for use in research.</p>
<strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">How Your Money Will Be Used</span></strong>
<p>For the 1st round, these funds will enable us to transform our current Alpha-stage portal into our NeuroAccelerator portal and make it accessible to researchers across the globe. The funds will be used for writing software, purchasing additional hardware, and contacting and promoting the service to the neurosciences community. Your contribution will provide in-kind neuroscience research accelerator processing time to a brain disease or dysfunction researcher.  </p>
<p>The Neuroscience Research Accelerator will have the capacity to host multiple simultaneous users to: (1) clean their research data, (2) model their data and contribute to our brain function database which will be used to better understand brain function, (3) allow researchers to use and experiment with existing marker detection algorithms for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and new markers for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p><strong>If Our First Round is Successful We Will Raise Additional Funds To:</strong></p>
<p>(1) receive data from Alzheimer's disease researchers so that we can apply our enhanced algorithms to identify markers, (2) develop a consumer level data gathering system for massive crowd sourcing of relevant brain data for enhancing the brain function library for global researchers, (3) gain regulatory approval for these algorithms to be used outside the research field and in medical applications, (4) to more actively engage global medical doctors in using this system for healthcare applications.</p>
<h1><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Background</span></strong></h1>
<p>Dr. Philip Zeman founded Applied Brain and Vision Sciences to give non-technical researchers access to the latest technical tools and methodological innovations to investigate their research problems. The key technology was created while Dr. Zeman was doing his Ph.D. work at the University of Victoria. The key technology, called MOST (Multiple-Origin Spatio-Temporal) modeling, is designed for looking at brain function in a deeper more holistic way, so that we can see brain function as a working system, which can significantly aid in understanding how our brains work and be incorporated into the early detection of major brain disease and dysfunction.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Kuntz</strong></p>
<p>Executive Director, Montana chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Matt Kuntz was born and raised in Helena, Montana. Matt received his bachelor’s degree from West Point and his law degree from the University of Oregon. Matt served as an infantry officer in the Army and was recognized as Distinguished Member of the Thirty Fifth Regiment for his service. Matt was practicing corporate law in Helena when his step-brother, a Montana National Guardsmen who suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, committed suicide. Spurred on by his step-brother’s death, Matt began advocating for effective screening and treatment of post traumatic stress injuries of our returning service members. Senate Bill 711 was the culmination of these efforts. It required multiple, face-to-face mental health screenings throughout America’s fighting force. Senator Ted Kennedy attached the bill to the Defense Authorization Act of 2010 and was signed into law on October 8, 2009.</p>
<p>In June of 2008, Matt took on the role of the National Alliance on Mental Illness for Montana’s (NAMI Montana’s) Executive Director in order to support, educate, and advocate for all Montanans suffering from serious mental illness and their families. Matt’s advocacy efforts on behalf of Montana’s service members and their families were documented in the book, Faces of Combat: PTSD &amp; TBI by Eric Newhouse. Matt was recognized by President Obama in his inauguration festivities as one of eighteen Ordinary Americans Who Have Made An Extraordinary Difference. Matt was also recognized as an Everyday All-Star by People Magazine and Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Matt is partner at Boyar &amp; Kuntz, PLLC. Matt is a member of the Board of Directors of the Uganda Rural Fund USA, Inc. and Rocky Mountain Development Council. He just released his latest book: Looking for Answers Through Dirty Glasses: Finding the Divine in a Challenging World.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stephen Neville, PhD, PEng (BC)</strong></p>
<p>Founder and Director of the Centre for Advanced Security, Privacy, and Information Systems Research (ASPIRe Centre), Faculty of Engineering, University of Victoria.</p>
<p>Dr. Neville has over 20 years of experience in the application, development, and use of high technology solutions by commercial companies. This includes: direct in-industry experience gained primarily in the San Francisco Bay area, first as a consultant on a $200M USD software redevelopment project focusing on applying expert systems technologies to a financial industry consumer loan processing systems, and then as the Principal Analyst on a U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR). This was a Security/Information Warfare Defense funded industry-collaborative advanced cyber-security project. This project focused on the development of a real-time computing cluster-based decision support system to support senior cyber-security analysts, with a target deployment environment being the mid-sized (~5,000 computer) non-secure computing networks of U.S. aircraft carriers. Throughout his career, Dr. Neville’s focus has been on industry and government-applied research and development, where this now also includes active involvement in the Alacrity Foundation of Canada’s supported Entrepreneurial Engineering Masters Program at the University of Victoria.</p>
<p>Dr. Neville’s research expertise spans a composite set of areas including statistical signal processing, statistical paper recognition, artificial intelligence and machine learning, larger-scale software systems-of-systems engineering, cluster and cloud computing, cyber-security, and cyber-privacy. The common underlying theme within Dr. Neville’s research and expertise is in the rigorous analysis of large-scale data sets obtained from operational engineering or business systems to develop quantitative assurances around these systems’: operational performances, their cyber-security, and/or their ability to appropriately protect private and proprietary information, particularly as required under the relevant privacy laws and regulations.</p>

<h1><strong><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Technical Details</span></strong></h1>
<p>For those of you interested in the details of how the Neuroscience Research Accelerator will help to move brain research forward, we have provided some additional information below.</p>
<p>(1) easy to access and easy-to-use sophisticated brain function analysis tools</p>
<p>Many of the new methodologies for processing EEG data that contain hints about how our brains work and malfunction in the presence of disease require a sophisticated technical background to use them correctly and efficiently. We have been implementing these tools in such a way as to make them easy to use by the non-technical neuroscience expert so that: (i) extra technical experts do not have to be hired to support the neuroscientist, and (ii) so that the neuroscience expert can focus on the science rather than writing software and learning analytical methods. The NeuroScienceAccelerator provides these tools so the user does not have to purchase expensive specialized software packages.</p>
<p>(2) leading research data analysis scripts and custom software available for replication of leading research</p>
<p>It is a necessity to replicate findings of an experiment to increase the certainty that an effect found in one experiment is real. This requirement for replication is actually a requirement that slows the research field significantly because replicating prior research isn’t sexy. It is however a necessity in learning about a research field, advancing the field, and is a good way for researchers to add to their publication record. It is to the advantage of leading researchers to make their methods available on the Neuroscience Research Accelerator because it will make it easier for others to follow in their footsteps and cite the peer-reviewed publications in which the methods were first published and any other related publications. For example, we can use this to help in the replication research for brain disease/dysfunction markers such as those related to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>(3) Aggregating data collected in multiple locations makes it possible to extract information from data that we could not otherwise find</p>
<p>This allows us to: (i) build realistic models describing how our brains process information and how our brains begin to fail in the presence of a disease or disorder, and (ii) find rarely occurring markers in the data that could be key in understanding important details about how our brains work and about brain-related disease and dysfunction.</p>
<p>(4) anyone can send us data for processing and contribute to our project</p>
<p>We will receive data from medical, research, and consumer grade EEG systems and incorporate these data into our processes to help us understand brain function. We will provide access to the system so as many people as possible can process data for their own needs and also contribute their data for processing as aggregate data to build sophisticated brain function models to better understand brain function and brain-related disease.</p>

What is it?
The NeuroScienceAccelerator is an online service for brain science researchers which will help them find cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia, Parkinson’s and other brain illnesses faster. The NeuroScienceAccelerator is for EEG researchers initially and provides them with five valuable time and money saving  services:


Data cleaning (all EEG data must be cleaned and the NeuroScienceAccelerator provides an automated process for this.)
 Proprietary artifact removal  validation model (so that it can assure only noise was removed and not brain function data)

Brain function model. (Our revolutionary brain function modeling system MOST can produce models of brain function that researches have never had available prior to the launch of the NeuroScienceAccelerator.

Load algorithms into the system. (The NeuroScienceAccelerator will enable researchers to upload their algorithms and data so that other researchers have access to them for experimental replication which is key to finding clues to cures)

Brain Function Library (The NeuroScienceAccelerator acts as a brain function library with an ever growing brain function data set classified by stimulus to enable large data set research).

It’s all about cooperation, sharing and crowd sourcing!
The Neuroscience Research Accelerator is an new way of addressing brain science research challenges through using an Internet data processing portal. Existing research procedures for extracting information from data and then organically having multiple labs do replication studies is a slow process. We need to move faster to address the growing global crisis in brain health. We're using advanced technology and the Internet to help. Article: The Birth of the NeuroScienceAccelerator. 
How the NeuroScienceAccelerator helps find cures and treatments FASTER:


Your Contribution
When you make a contribution we give you data processing time on the Neuroscience Research Accelerator at the rate of one minute per dollar donated. You can assign your new Neuroscience Research Accelerator processing time to the investigation of your choice or use it for your own research project.  The following projects: 
(1) Alzheimer's,
(2) Schizophrenia/Bipolar disorder,
(3) Auditory Processing Disorders
are investigations are awaiting time on the NeuroAccelerator. For more information about contributions, see our video describing how you fund a project of your choice.
After your contribution we will send you a request so you can specify to which investigation you would like to give your processing time.
The average experiment contains between 2000 and 5000 minutes of data that must be processed.
1. Alzheimer’s Disease
Canadian researchers in Montreal at a research institution called the INRS in conjunction with researchers at the University of Victoria are collaborating on a project to combine promising new Alzheimer’s detection methods with data mining methods developed at the University of Victoria. Their goal is to create a sensitive, selective, and reliable detector for identifying early-stage Alzheimer’s disease. These researchers will be using the NeuroscienceAccelerator to remove artefacts from their data and to determine what brain function characteristics best reveal mild cognitive impairment leading to Alzheimer’s. Once they have built their detector, the NeuroscienceAccelerator will be used to make the detector easily available to other Alzheimer’s researchers to do replication studies to ultimately determine the reliability of the detector. Researchers doing replication studies will submit their data, test the detector, and publish their results. New data will be aggregated on the NeuroScienceAccelerator, the detection algorithm will be improved based on new data, and new replication studies can take place to test new versions of the algorithm.
2. Schizophrenia/Bipolar disorder
Established researchers at the University of California, Irvine, USA have collected data in a study to reveal markers for two types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from a group of healthy individuals.  These researchers are currently awaiting time on the NeuroScienceAccelerator to remove artefacts from their data, use the new data they have collected to test a marker detection idea they created in prior research, and to enhance their marker detection idea using a procedure of brain source localization to improve the selectivity of their marker detection process in distinguishing between types of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder from healthy individuals.
3. Auditory Processing
Researchers in the UK are looking for ways that EEG methods might be used in a standard procedure to identify auditory processing dysfunction in children early.
In a pilot study assessing auditory processing disorders, they found that children with suspected auditory processing issues had different brain activities relating to auditory processing than age-matched controls. Their sample size for the study was small and they need a larger replication study to increase confidence in their finding.  Researchers who choose to replicate this study will use the data cleaning and peak detection algorithms available on the NeuroScienceAccelerator and can enhance the original methodology using the data mining capabilities of the accelerator.


Did you know:
In 2012, the direct costs of caring for those with Alzheimer’s to American society will total an estimated $200 billion, including $140 billion in costs to Medicare and Medicaid.
Unless something is done, the costs of Alzheimer’s in 2050 are estimated to total $1.1 trillion (in today’s dollars). Costs to Medicare and Medicaid will increase nearly 500 percent.
AND that's only one disease! Globally, brain-related illness generates more healthcare related costs and lost income than any other area of health: an estimated $2.0 trillion annually worldwide and $1.3 trillion annually in the U.S.
We believe there is a role for crowdsourcing brain health research and we're putting our technology on the line, so to speak, to work with global researchers, and funders like yourself who view innovation in healthcare as a route to discovering causes, cures, and treatments. So far a significant amount of neuroscience and healthcare research has been slow to find implementation, and become main-stream processes. We believe it is time to bring promising brain science out of the closet and to use new techniques and technologies to accelerate the processes.
The Neuroscience Research Accelerator is an online portal which will enable brain science researchers using electroencephalographic (EEG) brain function data to access state of the art data cleaning, validation processes and analysis techniques so that they can get the most from the data they collect and do it in as short a time as possible. Not only are we crowd funding this portal, but we're going to crowd source brain science research data from around the globe by providing a useful service to researchers for as *low a cost as possible and for many of them for free.
(*A small fee per use will be required outside of special free service arrangements for us to maintain the infrastructure and support a sustainable business model.)
In this new paradigm for research, we can do research faster and smarter by using these new technologies.
We have a road-map of milestones to build the remaining technology to help us help researchers and eventually our health systems to identify dementias, diseases, and disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, and Epilepsy early. Early detection will help researchers investigate cures and potentially understand causes.
We can do this with your help.
The Impact
The Neuroscience Research Accelerator (that we've nicknamed the NeuroScienceAcceleratorTM) will help the neuroscience research community in their search for better treatments, better pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical therapies for the major brain related illnesses of our day.
It does this through: providing a centralized method for data cleaning and processing, adding data to a central brain function library, containing data-driven models of how our brains transfer and process information which all researchers can share. This assists neuroscience research by bringing crowd data to advanced technology for understanding the brain and combining this with learning algorithms that process large amounts of data.
This new approach to neuroscience research will:
(1) provide online easy-to-use sophisticated brain function analysis tools to neuroscience investigators who would normally have to hire a technology expert,
(2) support replication of major brain illness research by making custom data analysis available in an easy-to-use automated form to new researchers doing replication studies,
(3) aggregate data collected from multiple researchers to generate robust data-driven brain function models and statistics, and identify weak but relevant findings in the data, and
(4) make it possible to build a growing aggregate data library for building brain function models which will be available for use in research.
How Your Money Will Be Used
For the 1st round, these funds will enable us to transform our current Alpha-stage portal into our NeuroAccelerator portal and make it accessible to researchers across the globe. The funds will be used for writing software, purchasing additional hardware, and contacting and promoting the service to the neurosciences community. Your contribution will provide in-kind neuroscience research accelerator processing time to a brain disease or dysfunction researcher.  
The Neuroscience Research Accelerator will have the capacity to host multiple simultaneous users to: (1) clean their research data, (2) model their data and contribute to our brain function database which will be used to better understand brain function, (3) allow researchers to use and experiment with existing marker detection algorithms for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and new markers for Alzheimer's disease.
If Our First Round is Successful We Will Raise Additional Funds To:
(1) receive data from Alzheimer's disease researchers so that we can apply our enhanced algorithms to identify markers, (2) develop a consumer level data gathering system for massive crowd sourcing of relevant brain data for enhancing the brain function library for global researchers, (3) gain regulatory approval for these algorithms to be used outside the research field and in medical applications, (4) to more actively engage global medical doctors in using this system for healthcare applications.

Executive Director, Montana chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Matt Kuntz was born and raised in Helena, Montana. Matt received his bachelor’s degree from West Point and his law degree from the University of Oregon. Matt served as an infantry officer in the Army and was recognized as Distinguished Member of the Thirty Fifth Regiment for his service. Matt was practicing corporate law in Helena when his step-brother, a Montana National Guardsmen who suffered from post traumatic stress disorder, committed suicide. Spurred on by his step-brother’s death, Matt began advocating for effective screening and treatment of post traumatic stress injuries of our returning service members. Senate Bill 711 was the culmination of these efforts. It required multiple, face-to-face mental health screenings throughout America’s fighting force. Senator Ted Kennedy attached the bill to the Defense Authorization Act of 2010 and was signed into law on October 8, 2009.
In June of 2008, Matt took on the role of the National Alliance on Mental Illness for Montana’s (NAMI Montana’s) Executive Director in order to support, educate, and advocate for all Montanans suffering from serious mental illness and their families. Matt’s advocacy efforts on behalf of Montana’s service members and their families were documented in the book, Faces of Combat: PTSD & TBI by Eric Newhouse. Matt was recognized by President Obama in his inauguration festivities as one of eighteen Ordinary Americans Who Have Made An Extraordinary Difference. Matt was also recognized as an Everyday All-Star by People Magazine and Major League Baseball.

For those of you interested in the details of how the Neuroscience Research Accelerator will help to move brain research forward, we have provided some additional information below.
(1) easy to access and easy-to-use sophisticated brain function analysis tools
Many of the new methodologies for processing EEG data that contain hints about how our brains work and malfunction in the presence of disease require a sophisticated technical background to use them correctly and efficiently. We have been implementing these tools in such a way as to make them easy to use by the non-technical neuroscience expert so that: (i) extra technical experts do not have to be hired to support the neuroscientist, and (ii) so that the neuroscience expert can focus on the science rather than writing software and learning analytical methods. The NeuroScienceAccelerator provides these tools so the user does not have to purchase expensive specialized software packages.
(2) leading research data analysis scripts and custom software available for replication of leading research
It is a necessity to replicate findings of an experiment to increase the certainty that an effect found in one experiment is real. This requirement for replication is actually a requirement that slows the research field significantly because replicating prior research isn’t sexy. It is however a necessity in learning about a research field, advancing the field, and is a good way for researchers to add to their publication record. It is to the advantage of leading researchers to make their methods available on the Neuroscience Research Accelerator because it will make it easier for others to follow in their footsteps and cite the peer-reviewed publications in which the methods were first published and any other related publications. For example, we can use this to help in the replication research for brain disease/dysfunction markers such as those related to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.
(3) Aggregating data collected in multiple locations makes it possible to extract information from data that we could not otherwise find
This allows us to: (i) build realistic models describing how our brains process information and how our brains begin to fail in the presence of a disease or disorder, and (ii) find rarely occurring markers in the data that could be key in understanding important details about how our brains work and about brain-related disease and dysfunction.
(4) anyone can send us data for processing and contribute to our project
We will receive data from medical, research, and consumer grade EEG systems and incorporate these data into our processes to help us understand brain function. We will provide access to the system so as many people as possible can process data for their own needs and also contribute their data for processing as aggregate data to build sophisticated brain function models to better understand brain function and brain-related disease.

<h3>Help Ottawa's historic Mayfair Theatre buy a Digital Cinema Package (DCP) projector — and stay open for another 80 years!</h3>
<p>Celebrating its 80th anniversary this year, the Mayfair Theatre is one of the oldest independent movie houses in all of Canada. In its eight decades of operation, the Mayfair has never been owned by, or affiliated with, any of the major cinema chains.</p>
<p>We're proud of our indie heritage, and that's why we're turning to Indiegogo now.</p>
<p>By the end of 2012, studios and distributors will no longer be making or shipping film prints — period. To stay in business, the Mayfair needs to buy a Digital Cinema Package (DCP) projector.</p>
<p>It’s a big investment, but we’re committed to making it happen. We’re saving and re-investing every nickel we can, but we could really use your help, too.</p>
<p>Please join us, and help keep the Mayfair open for another 80 years!</p>

<p>Specifically, we need to raise another $15,000.00.</p>
<p>Every penny will go toward the purchase, shipping, setup and installation of the projector.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we beat our goal?</h3>
<p><strong>We upgrade the projector. </strong></p>
<p>Anything extra we raise up to $20,000.00 will be put toward the purchase of a scaler, which will allow us to use the DCP projector to show films from DVD, BluRay, Laserdisc, VHS or other formats. </p>

</div></div>","The University of Utah (commissioned by NEC): Larger Monitors and Dual Screens Help Users Edit Text and Spreadsheets Using a larger monitor or dual monitors helped users complete tasks as much as 52 percent faster, saving up to 2.5 hours a day.   
Many office workers receive the benefit of a 2nd screen while at the office, but this is not always easily available while working from home. 
All the wires and cables needed to connect to power and the computer are unsightly and make moving around to a different room very difficult. And there are never enough sockets to fit all the extras.
A conventional screen is heavy and bulky to carry.  It is a challenge to find plug points, and to connect the screen to the laptop or PC, and to carry around the bundle of wires, plugs etc.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could have a portable totally wirefree second screen to use with your laptop, Mac, iPhone, or Android?  What if you did not need to plug it in or use any cables?
But technology is there to make our lives easier. Introducing OpenScreen!
OpenScreen wirefree touchscreen brings you an advanced touchable multi-touch screen without the cables.
And its easy to use.
Once you switch on the OpenScreen, simplify turn on your phone or laptop.  The OpenScreen device will appear as a device for you to connect to.  Its that easy.
 
   




 
 In 2013 Manoj Chwala, innovator and serial entrepreneur, was doing a lot of business travel and one of his biggest bugbears was how to use a second screen when out of the office.  He needed 2 screens to work efficiently but this was quite difficult as there were lots of interface cables and everything seemed to need a power supply.When working at client offices, remote sites or hotel desks, space & plugs were limited and setup time just took too long.At this time Windows 8 had been launched and the Netgear Widi “wireless dongle” became available. So Manoj began experimenting with his Sony Vaio Duo to develop a portable wireless connection to a monitor using the Widi(Miracast).He eventually succeeded in developing a prototype portable wirefree Monitor. When he showed the product to his friends they all asked if they could buy one and even the patent lawyers ordered some.  In 2016 he approached Flextronic and then in 2018 he went to China and started discussions with Chinese manufacturers. Manoj has a track record in innovation, he has worked for a range of blue chip companies before working on startups.

Simply, we’re going to change lives by providing a safe, clean and anonymous social network for people ages 13+ going through the coming out process. As a startup guided and facilitated by the <a href=""http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/centers-excellence/dingman-center-entrepreneurship"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship</a> at the University of Maryland-College Park, the <a href=""justlikeyou.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">justlikeyou.org</a> network has come a long way from its humble beginnings.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/342726/files/20140201062639-jly_Indiegogo_Image_Team.jpg?1391264799"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Currently working toward 501c3 (not-for-profit) status, our long-term goals are to: develop technology, coordinate LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and ally) competency trainings, and connect users from the network to their local communities for needed support through coming out. The funds we raise will help to accomplish these goals and further support our mission.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Bottom line: <i>We are working to eliminate the burden of coming out.</i></p><ul></ul><h3>How will we accomplish the goal?</h3><p></p><p>Well, that’s as easy as 1-2-3 (for the user!)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/342738/files/20140201064305-jly_Indiegogo_Image_123.jpg?1391265785"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The behind-the-scenes magic, however, is a bit more complicated.<p><br/></p><p>This is how it works:</p><ul>
<li><p>Via a Likert Scale questionnaire that will be filled out during the sign-up process, like the one below, the justlikeyou.org staff—backed by a team of clinical psychologists and LGBTQ professionals—has developed a tool to quantify over-arching emotions commonly felt during a user’s coming-out process. </p></li>
<li><p>Then, leveraging a justlikeyou.org’s algorithm, we’ll match the new user to other users and JLY (justlikeyou.org) volunteers who have documented similar responses. </p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the users will be able to share and communicate their experiences in a safe and supportive environment through secure messaging.</p></li>
</ul><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/342743/files/20140201064742-jly_Indiegogo_image_likertscale.jpg?1391266062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This idea is actually very simple at its core: users who have felt similar emotions during their coming out process can share their own personal stories in order to encourage comfortable and helpful dialogue. While this will be accomplished initially through individual inbox messages, we look forward to introducing additional secure chatting features once we grow our membership.</span><br/></p><p>As you might imagine, the matching process is not an exact science. If any users aren’t looking to speak to someone who is feeling the same way they are, that user will also have the option to interact with JLY volunteers who have been through coming out or search for users based on their own criteria.</p><p></p><h3>Great, is this actually safe?</h3><p><span><span></span></span></p>
<p></p><p>Before the core justlikeyou.org team decided to move forward with this venture, safety and anonymity for all users was the top priority.  As such, we’ve incorporated several features that maximize safety. We’ll restrict the exchange of personal information such as:</p><ul>
<li><p>Pictures</p></li>
<li><p>Videos</p></li>
<li><p>Street address</p></li>
<li><p>Derogatory/defamatory language</p></li>
</ul><p>Remember, this is a resource that connects real people with real experiences. We are looking to have the personal narrative guide the conversation around coming out, not someone’s physical appearance.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Though we DO NOT provide any in-crisis, medical, and/or mental health advise we would like to be able to provide users with resources for other organizations that operate for those purposes.</p>
<p></p><h3>
<span><span></span></span>So, why are we doing this?</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p>Every staff member who is working with the <i>justlikeyou.org </i>network has
experienced in one way or another the complexity of emotions associated with
the coming out process – even when surrounded by trusted supporters. We
identify with the struggles and anxieties associated with coming out. We want
to help rid the burden of coming out by providing a safe space for LGBTQ and allied individuals to talk about
their experiences with one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is why we’ve employed a global approach to our business

<p></p></div>","We really are justlikeyou!Just take a peek below!We’re twenty-one students and professionals across five countries with varied and intersecting identities. Simply, we’re going to change lives by providing a safe, clean and anonymous social network for people ages 13+ going through the coming out process. As a startup guided and facilitated by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland-College Park, the justlikeyou.org network has come a long way from its humble beginnings.Currently working toward 501c3 (not-for-profit) status, our long-term goals are to: develop technology, coordinate LGBTQA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning and ally) competency trainings, and connect users from the network to their local communities for needed support through coming out. The funds we raise will help to accomplish these goals and further support our mission.Bottom line: We are working to eliminate the burden of coming out.How will we accomplish the goal?Well, that’s as easy as 1-2-3 (for the user!)The behind-the-scenes magic, however, is a bit more complicated.This is how it works:
Via a Likert Scale questionnaire that will be filled out during the sign-up process, like the one below, the justlikeyou.org staff—backed by a team of clinical psychologists and LGBTQ professionals—has developed a tool to quantify over-arching emotions commonly felt during a user’s coming-out process. 
Then, leveraging a justlikeyou.org’s algorithm, we’ll match the new user to other users and JLY (justlikeyou.org) volunteers who have documented similar responses. 
Finally, the users will be able to share and communicate their experiences in a safe and supportive environment through secure messaging.
This idea is actually very simple at its core: users who have felt similar emotions during their coming out process can share their own personal stories in order to encourage comfortable and helpful dialogue. While this will be accomplished initially through individual inbox messages, we look forward to introducing additional secure chatting features once we grow our membership.As you might imagine, the matching process is not an exact science. If any users aren’t looking to speak to someone who is feeling the same way they are, that user will also have the option to interact with JLY volunteers who have been through coming out or search for users based on their own criteria.Great, is this actually safe?
Before the core justlikeyou.org team decided to move forward with this venture, safety and anonymity for all users was the top priority.  As such, we’ve incorporated several features that maximize safety. We’ll restrict the exchange of personal information such as:
Pictures
Videos
Street address
Derogatory/defamatory language
Remember, this is a resource that connects real people with real experiences. We are looking to have the personal narrative guide the conversation around coming out, not someone’s physical appearance.Though we DO NOT provide any in-crisis, medical, and/or mental health advise we would like to be able to provide users with resources for other organizations that operate for those purposes.

So, why are we doing this?
Every staff member who is working with the justlikeyou.org network has
experienced in one way or another the complexity of emotions associated with
the coming out process – even when surrounded by trusted supporters. We
identify with the struggles and anxieties associated with coming out. We want
to help rid the burden of coming out by providing a safe space for LGBTQ and allied individuals to talk about
their experiences with one another.

This is why we’ve employed a global approach to our business
model. Coming out is not uniquely American; it's a global issue and geographically
unique. As a flattened world, we can glean many insights from people throughout
the world. Thus, we’ve designed the network to be centered on that will connect
users and volunteers with a unique focus outside the 50 states. Why we need YOU!
We are hoping you will contribute to the cause. By financially backing the creation of this online community, you are directly helping to eliminate the burden of coming out.You’re funding a community, a safe space for people looking to become more comfortable with their identity. You’re increasing an individual’s confidence and you will be a driving force behind the LGBTQA movement.Please help us out!
We need to raise $50,000. Sounds like a lot because it is.This money will be used immediately to enhance our volunteer training curriculum, training new JLY volunteers, increase site functionality, and develop a mobile app extension to take JLY worldwide.We realize not reaching our goal is a possibility, but
funding will still go proportionately toward mobile technology development,
enhanced site functionality, composing an education curriculum for volunteer
trainings, and the costs of volunteer training. Obviously, if we weren't able to reach our goal, funds will be
allocated at lower amounts.Are there perks for donating?
Of course! We have perks that we've divided into two categories: Store Incentives and Experience Incentives. Below, you’ll see a list of these perks; to the right, you can see a more in-depth description of these perks.Store Incentives: 
($5) JLY Supporter Status

Une application (web ou smartphone) pour booster votre potentiel et générer la réussite de vos projetsDans cette application, vous confrontez votre réalité avec les comportements avérés des personnes qui ont réussi et ressortez avec une identification rapide de vos talents, de vos faiblesses et des recommandations concrètes d’amélioration.Après un test préalable, l’application vous proposera sous un format simple et convivial des clés d’amélioration (liens, formations, lectures,…) et des programmes adaptés à votre situation particulière.Avec le soutien et sous la supervision de l’Université de Liège, la conception de cette application se fonde sur des théories bien connues et éprouvées relatives au succès mais également sur un travail d’observations d’experts dans l’accompagnement de dirigeants. 3 arguments qui rendent SuXess indispensables Sortir l’entrepreneur/manager de son isolement, l’amener à réfléchir autrement et à booster sa motivation.En 2018, plus de 10.000 entreprises faisaient faillite en Belgique, des plus grosses aux plus petites. Si les circonstances économiques y sont pour beaucoup, l’absence de remise en question des dirigeants est également un facteur prédominant. Mais c’est difficile. Le manque de temps, l’habitude, les finances ... le doute font que recourir à un coach ne semble pas toujours une option. Il en résulte une perte d’énergie qui percole directement dans la société.En proposant une application qui permet à chacun de s’auto-évaluer rapidement, en toute discrétion, vous allez enfin prendre votre destin en main. Avec l’appui de SuXess, vous disposerez très simplement d’un regard extérieur sur vos propres talents (à cultiver) et sur vos faiblesses (à travailler). Faire prospérer nos entreprises en rendant accessible au plus grand nombre des connaissances éprouvées sur le dynamique du succès.De tout temps, des entrepreneurs et managers de même qualité, de même formation, placés dans des circonstances similaires ont obtenu des résultats bien différents.La réussite à long terme n’est pas le seul fruit du hasard. Il est démontré que celle-ci relève d’un processus, d’un état d’esprit et de comportements qui, s’ils sont appliqués de façon constante, alimentent le cercle vertueux de la réussite.C’est cette connaissance que nous voulons partager au plus grand nombre par une application web simple, et conviviale qui vous permettra de savoir où vous en êtes.Apporter des solutions adaptées au vécu de chacun, à portée de main…L’application va plus loin, non seulement elle vous donnera une idée claire de votre potentiel à générer la réussite mais elle vous donnera des clés d’amélioration précieuses grâce au travail réalisé par nos experts, coachs de dirigeants et coachs personnels. Vous disposerez de liens, de formations, de diverses suggestions pour booster votre potentiel là où c’est le plus nécessaire. Ne perdez plus de temps. La campagne de Crowdfunding : une occasion unique de soutenir un projet positif et faire gagner nos entreprisesNotre ambition est de lever 50 000 € pour financer le développement de SuXess .Dès 20 €, vous pouvez nous apporter un soutien. N’hésitez pas.  Ne dit-on pas : « les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivières »…Votre soutien n’est pas obligatoirement assorti d’avantages particuliers. Cependant, pour remercier ceux qui le souhaitent, nous avons élaboré un programme d’avantages attractif :
20 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique,
50 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique + une bougie de massage bio,

100 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique + une bougie de massage Bio + un webinaire sur la gestion du temps,
250 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique + une bougie de massage bio + un webinaire sur la gestion du temps + 4 conférences inspirantes,
700 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique + une bougie de massage bio + un webinaire sur la gestion du temps + 4 conférences inspirantes + un Audit flash à choisir parmi 9 thématiques,
1250 € = notre gratitude et un arbre planté en Belgique + une bougie de massage bio + un webinaire sur la gestion du temps  + 4 conférences inspirantes + un Audit flash à choisir parmi 7 thématiques + SuXess

Les descriptifs complets des contreparties sont ici.Dans le choix de passer par un crowdfunding pour financer cet outil, il est évident que nous avons pris en considération d’autres objectifs:
Mobiliser notre réseau dans un projet positif,
Faire passer un message sur l’ADN d’XPrience : l’humain et le développement durable,

Créer un lien avec des personnes qui nous veulent du bien au travers de rencontres à l’occasion par exemple de conférences inspirantes ou l’envoi de petits cadeaux de remerciement…

<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">We all use smartphones, PC’s and tablets and we do like if the same documents and pictures are available from several sources – that’s why we use Cloud systems. However, because of certain security issues that came to light recently, we started thinking about what will happen to the contents uploaded by us. How can we prevent unauthorised persons to have access to our data and files? As we know, some employees of online storage providers do have the rights to look into the contents uploaded by us, and providers have a duty to submit all requested data and content to the authorities. A good example here is Facebook, who not only looks into and trades with our content, but we constantly face problems where we don’t know who has access to our photos, data, and it’s uncertain whether the data deleted by us has really been deleted or if it will only be inaccessible for us in the future.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">The digital era always held opportunities for merging tried and tested technologies, to make them better. With ever increasing technological advances, the different file sharing, cloud and social media users have ever increasing expectations towards developers. These expectations are more and more difficult to meet, as merging of different technologies is not an easy task. I would like to stress the importance of security, which is in the online world is becoming somewhat “exotic”.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">I would like to introduce a revolutionary new technology that merges the benefits of social networks and Cloud systems, and by excluding the disadvantages it could create a user surface that satisfied both our social media and file sharing needs, without having to worry about security and accessibility.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">People rightly expect to have access to their data anywhere, and anytime. The Cloud system was developed to serve this purpose. With the help of this system we can easily synchronise our data and devices connected to the Cloud, and also share it with our friends.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">I will briefly explain the current technology, very simplified.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">When we upload a document, photo or any data into the cloud from our PC, our file gets transferred onto the chosen cloud provider’s server. As soon as it is there it will be visible on our other devices, and it can be downloaded manually or synchronised automatically. If we share a file with our friends, it will be visible and accessible from their device as well.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">The problem with this system is that we are at the mercy of the provider. If we don’t encrypt our content, everyone who has access to the server will have access to it. The other problem is that providers can cooperate with various authorities, who can have access to our data anytime.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">If authorities see it fit, they can confiscate the providers’ servers, as it happened in the case of Megaupload. Hundreds of users have lost their files and documents.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">Our technology works on a completely different basis. Our idea is to encrypt and split the data into pieces on the user’s PC. Because of the splitted and encrypted file doesn’t get uploaded onto any user’s PC in full, only one piece. There is no central server, no central control, so the user’s details can’t be obtained by overtaking those. Bitcoin works on a similar basis. The user however can access his data with his password anytime, from anywhere.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western""><span style=""font-size: x-large;""><strong>How does it works?</strong></span></p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">The program encrypts and splitting the content to be uploaded, one by one. After the splitting process the system uploads the bits of the content onto PC’s in the cloud at random. The receiving PC’s forward the data, until each piece is saved in at least 3 locations in the cloud.</p>

<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">The pieces of the user’s content could be saved anywhere, scattered around the world. The client software can track each piece of the content with the user’s username and password, even when installed onto a new device.</p>
<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">When the user wants to access his data again, the software instantly collects the pieces from the storage PC’s and unites them, then using the decryptor it eliminates the encryption, thus making the file readable again.</p>

<p align=""JUSTIFY"" class=""western"">A huge advantage of this system is that we are not dependant on any providers. The system is secure as no authorities can track what content each user has uploaded, and what PC’s the pieces of the data are on.

<p>Qrezy is small company out of Northern Virginia that bridges the gap between the digital and personal world. Qrezy was formed in 2011 with the goal of enhancing the aesthetics of QR codes. Over the years we have pivoted and re-focused on creating interactive experiences and storytelling tools. We’ve spent a year and half developing our first product and we’re proud to present, Qrezy Cards. </p>

<h1>What is a Qrezy Card?</h1>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>Qrezy Cards are interactive cards that can connect people to digital content and receive updates at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Each card is a tool that will enhance the way you interact with people. They are ideal if you’re looking to share a new app, a song, presentation, a new product, documents, your portfolio, and so much more.</p>
<p>Qrezy Cards unitizes Near Field Communication (NFC) and Quick Response (QR) Codes.<br/><br/>- NFC or near field communication is a low power, short range communication between two devices. Smartphones with nfc, can simply interact with other nfc enabled devices to share data or information. <br/></p>
<p>- QR codes are 2d dimensional bar codes that can hold data and can be scanned from practically any smartphone with a camera to connect to that data.</p>
<p><b>NFC Example:</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/933460/files/20141015131725-nfc-gif.gif?1413404245"" src="""" style=""width: 621.621621621622px; height: 345px;""/></p>
<p>With NFC, no need to scan, simply tap the card and it will send people immediately to your digital content. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>QR Code Example:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/933464/files/20141015131846-qr-gif.gif?1413404326"" src="""" style=""width: 628.656716417911px; height: 351px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>By adding the code, anyone with at least a camera phone is capable of scanning the code to access the digital content.<br/><br/></p>

<p><i>Apple’s new iPhone 6 has NFC, but unfortunately Apple has locked it from developers for the time being to focus on Apple Pay. Once they unlock the NFC capabilities the cards should be able to easily interact with the phones, but we will make an announcement and release a video once we can confirm.</i></p>

Qrezy is small company out of Northern Virginia that bridges the gap between the digital and personal world. Qrezy was formed in 2011 with the goal of enhancing the aesthetics of QR codes. Over the years we have pivoted and re-focused on creating interactive experiences and storytelling tools. We’ve spent a year and half developing our first product and we’re proud to present, Qrezy Cards. 







What is a Qrezy Card?


Qrezy Cards are interactive cards that can connect people to digital content and receive updates at anytime.


Each card is a tool that will enhance the way you interact with people. They are ideal if you’re looking to share a new app, a song, presentation, a new product, documents, your portfolio, and so much more.
Qrezy Cards unitizes Near Field Communication (NFC) and Quick Response (QR) Codes.- NFC or near field communication is a low power, short range communication between two devices. Smartphones with nfc, can simply interact with other nfc enabled devices to share data or information. 
- QR codes are 2d dimensional bar codes that can hold data and can be scanned from practically any smartphone with a camera to connect to that data.
NFC Example:

With NFC, no need to scan, simply tap the card and it will send people immediately to your digital content. 

QR Code Example:




By adding the code, anyone with at least a camera phone is capable of scanning the code to access the digital content.



Compatible Devices:

Apple’s new iPhone 6 has NFC, but unfortunately Apple has locked it from developers for the time being to focus on Apple Pay. Once they unlock the NFC capabilities the cards should be able to easily interact with the phones, but we will make an announcement and release a video once we can confirm.

Card Design:
We offer two design options, our designed presets or a custom design that you can submit!
Qrezy Card Design Presets:



4 colors to choose from
Add your logo or name on the front
Information on the back
Badge: a small image that describes the digital content (Optional)
We'll add a QR code on the back to connect to your content. The code will be the same color as the card. 
Qrezy Code™ (Optional Upgrade*) - We can create a beautiful Qrezy Code in replace of the QR Code, to better reflect your brand.










Can't believe it? Try scanning them.

Custom Qrezy Card Design:You can submit your own custom design by downloading and following our simple guidelines. At the end of the campaign you will send us the guideline with your design and we will begin production!

<p><strong>Aren't there more Ultima Dragons items available? </strong></p>
<p>There are! We'll have a handful of additional prints and coins plus t-shirts, pins, keychains, and more. All items will be offered on the UDIC Stuff Store after initial orders are fulfilled. (Or <a href=""mailto:ultimadragons25th@gmail.com?subject=UDIC%20Loot&amp;body=I'm%20interested%20in%20additional%20loot%20items%20beyond%20what's%20offered%20through%20IndieGoGo."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">write in</a> for the list if you can't wait!) Some are few in quantity or were produced in limited-edition 25th Anniversary colors, so this is a chance to acquire some of these rare collectible items!</p>
<p><strong>What if I miss the fundraiser?</strong></p>
<p>We'll produce a few extra spinners, so if the campaign is over, you'll still be able to buy one. They'll run for $6 for a single spinner either way. The discounts and bundles offered here are exclusive, however!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What are the Risks?</h3>
<p>The only real risk is not raising enough funds to have the initial order made. Beyond that, there is a chance the amount produced won't be enough to cover future demand, so pledge now to ensure you will get yours!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if a spinner isn't for me? Can I still help?</h3>
<p>From what we've seen, nearly <i>everyone</i> who picks up a spinner becomes a convert - the steady whir and gyroscopic feel are addicting! Even if you decide it's not your bag, share this campaign on your personal Facebook, Twitter, Reddit or other social medium of your choice - anywhere there may be Dragons lurking who might enjoy this nifty gadget.</p>

What if I want more than one loot item?
Contact us to buy loot items separately! We can combine shipping for you too.
Aren't there more Ultima Dragons items available? 
There are! We'll have a handful of additional prints and coins plus t-shirts, pins, keychains, and more. All items will be offered on the UDIC Stuff Store after initial orders are fulfilled. (Or write in for the list if you can't wait!) Some are few in quantity or were produced in limited-edition 25th Anniversary colors, so this is a chance to acquire some of these rare collectible items!
What if I miss the fundraiser?
We'll produce a few extra spinners, so if the campaign is over, you'll still be able to buy one. They'll run for $6 for a single spinner either way. The discounts and bundles offered here are exclusive, however!
 
What are the Risks?
The only real risk is not raising enough funds to have the initial order made. Beyond that, there is a chance the amount produced won't be enough to cover future demand, so pledge now to ensure you will get yours!
 

What if a spinner isn't for me? Can I still help?
From what we've seen, nearly everyone who picks up a spinner becomes a convert - the steady whir and gyroscopic feel are addicting! Even if you decide it's not your bag, share this campaign on your personal Facebook, Twitter, Reddit or other social medium of your choice - anywhere there may be Dragons lurking who might enjoy this nifty gadget.
 
Thanks for supporting this effort to bring joy to the UDIC!

<p> </p>
<p>Modeled on the Periodic Table of Elements, the Periodic Calendar uses a previously ignored dimension within our conception of time to reveal the full landscape of possible days and become a fully functional perpetual calendar capable of exploring the past, present and future!</p>
<p>While the best way to get to know the Periodic Calendar is to have a 16""x38"" print of it right in front of you, there are a number of ways for you to acquaint yourself with it now, including below with <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/periodiccalendar/x/1790626#taste"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Taste of the Periodic Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over at <a href=""http://www.PeriodicCalendar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.PeriodicCalendar.com</a> you will always find the latest news and research into this new calendar system, including a copy you can <a href=""http://periodiccalendar.com/learn-more-about-the-periodic-calendar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zoom</a> into for a closer look and the first episode of our Quick Start Series: <a href=""http://periodiccalendar.com/2012/12/will-the-real-fourth-of-july-please-stand-up/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will the Real Fourth of July Please Stand Up?</a>  Finally, on a daily basis we will be covering each element as they appear on the <a href=""http://periodiccalendar.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">P-Cal Blog</a>, along with discussions on how holidays and other <a href=""http://periodiccalendar.com/category/observances/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">observances</a> should be handled in the Periodic Age. </p>
<p>The Periodic Calendar is new to us all and I hope you join in as we explore this new way to look at time...</p>

<h2>The ""Who?"", ""What?"" and ""Why?""</h2>
<p>My name is Joey Sellers and I'm a writer and conceptual artist originally from Memphis, TN, who currently lives in San Francisco by way of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Ape Con Myth is a conceptual art think tank I started in 2007.  It's far more difficult to explain than the calendar, but if you are interested, <a href=""http://www.ApeConMyth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ApeConMyth.com</a> is always waiting for you with new wonders. </p>
<p>Suffice to say, one tradition that has developed over the years is <a href=""http://www.apeconmyth.com/00006-the-ape-con-myth-calendar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Ape Con Myth calendar</a>.  Usually a less than functional variation on the traditional wall calendar, this year's offering blows all of its predecessors off the wall.</p>
</div>
<div>Why should you contribute to the first major calendar debut of the 21st century?  </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Whether you use it or not, it will look great on your wall 365 days a year.  Sometimes even 366.</li>
<li>When was the last time someone offered to unlock a new dimension of time for you?</li>
<li>As a perpetual calendar, it pays for itself in one year, yet can be passed on for generations to come. </li>
</ul>
<p>This is the last calendar anyone needs until we leave Earth and start orbiting other suns! </p>

<h2>The ""How Much Do I Need?"" and ""What's In It For You?""</h2>
<p>The basic goal of this campaign is to raise $1,000 to cover some of the printing costs of the first edition.  It's not the full amount, it's just how much I'm short, so your contribution will go directly to paying the printer and keeping Ape Con Myth and myself out of debt.</p>
<p>In return, there are some great perks available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Top among them are prints of the calendar itself.  Don't miss the early bird special!</li>
<li>With the Personal Party Pack, you get a calendar, a commemorative magnet for your fridge, a button AND magnet featuring your very own Birth Element, plus a personal Thank You for your generous support!</li>
<li>Only three sets are available, but if you hurry, you could get ""The Archive"", which features all 5 Ape Con Myth calendars ever produced, covering 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and now with the Periodic Calendar, forever! </li>

<h2>The ""Please Spread the Word"" and ""Stay Tuned""</h2>
After three long months of development, including two or three weeks now (I can’t remember) of working 10-14 hour days to get the Periodic Calendar’s 13,008 individual little pieces just so, making sure all the numbers check out and getting it ready for press, I’m sliding/collapsing into day one of this campaign with a video, a one page website and a hope that YOU will help me get the ball rolling these first few days by spreading the word!   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are sharing buttons in every direction, so please, take a moment and locate <del>the closest exit</del> your favorite social network.</div>
<div>
<p>Meanwhile, stay tuned because there will be steady updates here and over at <a href=""http://www.PeriodicCalendar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.PeriodicCalendar.com</a> throughout this campaign.  </p>

<div> </div>
<div>Years can begin on any of the seven days of the week, which is why your birthday falls on different day of the week from year to year.  Whatever day the year begins on creates a distinct layout of days, weeks and months that the Periodic Calendar refers to as the seven Year Types. </div>

Modeled on the Periodic Table of Elements, the Periodic Calendar uses a previously ignored dimension within our conception of time to reveal the full landscape of possible days and become a fully functional perpetual calendar capable of exploring the past, present and future!
While the best way to get to know the Periodic Calendar is to have a 16""x38"" print of it right in front of you, there are a number of ways for you to acquaint yourself with it now, including below with A Taste of the Periodic Calendar.
Meanwhile, over at www.PeriodicCalendar.com you will always find the latest news and research into this new calendar system, including a copy you can zoom into for a closer look and the first episode of our Quick Start Series: Will the Real Fourth of July Please Stand Up?  Finally, on a daily basis we will be covering each element as they appear on the P-Cal Blog, along with discussions on how holidays and other observances should be handled in the Periodic Age. 
The Periodic Calendar is new to us all and I hope you join in as we explore this new way to look at time...

The ""Who?"", ""What?"" and ""Why?""
My name is Joey Sellers and I'm a writer and conceptual artist originally from Memphis, TN, who currently lives in San Francisco by way of Brooklyn.
Ape Con Myth is a conceptual art think tank I started in 2007.  It's far more difficult to explain than the calendar, but if you are interested, www.ApeConMyth.com is always waiting for you with new wonders. 
Suffice to say, one tradition that has developed over the years is the Ape Con Myth calendar.  Usually a less than functional variation on the traditional wall calendar, this year's offering blows all of its predecessors off the wall.

Why should you contribute to the first major calendar debut of the 21st century?  


Whether you use it or not, it will look great on your wall 365 days a year.  Sometimes even 366.
When was the last time someone offered to unlock a new dimension of time for you?
As a perpetual calendar, it pays for itself in one year, yet can be passed on for generations to come. 

This is the last calendar anyone needs until we leave Earth and start orbiting other suns!

The ""How Much Do I Need?"" and ""What's In It For You?""
The basic goal of this campaign is to raise $1,000 to cover some of the printing costs of the first edition.  It's not the full amount, it's just how much I'm short, so your contribution will go directly to paying the printer and keeping Ape Con Myth and myself out of debt.
In return, there are some great perks available:

Top among them are prints of the calendar itself.  Don't miss the early bird special!
With the Personal Party Pack, you get a calendar, a commemorative magnet for your fridge, a button AND magnet featuring your very own Birth Element, plus a personal Thank You for your generous support!
Only three sets are available, but if you hurry, you could get ""The Archive"", which features all 5 Ape Con Myth calendars ever produced, covering 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012 and now with the Periodic Calendar, forever!

The ""Please Spread the Word"" and ""Stay Tuned""
After three long months of development, including two or three weeks now (I can’t remember) of working 10-14 hour days to get the Periodic Calendar’s 13,008 individual little pieces just so, making sure all the numbers check out and getting it ready for press, I’m sliding/collapsing into day one of this campaign with a video, a one page website and a hope that YOU will help me get the ball rolling these first few days by spreading the word!   
 
There are sharing buttons in every direction, so please, take a moment and locate the closest exit your favorite social network.

Meanwhile, stay tuned because there will be steady updates here and over at www.PeriodicCalendar.com throughout this campaign.  
Your support is greatly appreciated!!!
Thank you for your time and consideration!
Sincerely,
Joey Sellers

A Taste of the Periodic Calendar
 With the Periodic Calendar, you can explore the past...
 

 
... jet into the future...
 

 
...or dig right into the present.
 

 
Below you can see that 2013 is orange...
 

 
...which matches right up with the color-code you’ll find at every level of the Periodic Calendar...
 

 
...and tells us that 2013 is a Tuesday Year. That is, 2013 begins on a Tuesday, which brings us to the idea at the heart of this calendar. 
 
Years can begin on any of the seven days of the week, which is why your birthday falls on different day of the week from year to year.  Whatever day the year begins on creates a distinct layout of days, weeks and months that the Periodic Calendar refers to as the seven Year Types. 
 
Here’s our Tuesday Year, with active elements in color and inactive ones in gray...
 

 
... and now to bring it all together!
 

Don't worry if it all doesn't make sense the first time.  It might take a few years or even decades to get the hang of The Periodic Calendar, (I mean, it's going to take seven years to get through all the Year Types once) but that's just one of the reasons that this is the last calendar you will ever need!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>An idea to revolutionize how people visit archaeological sites</p>
<p>I'm Maya Exploration Center’s Director, Archaeologist Dr. Ed Barnhart, and I plan to develop a new series of apps for mobile devices that will allow tourists to hold a world class tour guide right in the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>These site specific travel apps will use the GPS capability of all mobile devices to guide their users around the ruins in a fun and interactive way.  Users will be able to ask, “where am I?”, or “bring me to this temple”, or “where should I go from here?”.  The app will have a whole host of information about each building or feature of the site available as text or audio files narrated by my voice.  Is a temple roped off and access restricted?  This app will have photos of what’s inside!  Interactive features such as incorporating a user’s own photos and videos will make the app a valuable scrapbook long after the visit and social media sharing features will let users share their experience in real time.</p>
<p>The first of these apps to be developed will be called TULUM and it will focus on the Maya Riviera ruins of the same name.  Advertised with a billboard in front of the ruins and brochures in Maya Riviera resorts and hotels, TULUM will be downloaded and used by a significant percentage of the over one million people who visit the site annually.  Distributed through Apple’s ubiquitous iTunes online Store, access will be easy and available from virtually anywhere on the planet.  Tulum’s 4G cellular data coverage and free wifi at the visitor center will make downloading the app a snap.</p>
<p>And by the way, you don't need to visit Tulum to enjoy this app.  It will be so full of information that it will be a like a whole e-book about Tulum in your pocket.</p>
<p>If you would like to see the full business plan, just email me at <a href=""mailto:edbarnhart@mayaexploration.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">edbarnhart@mayaexploration.org</a></p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I've already contributed two months of research and $1000 to get the app developers I hired started. The development schedule is a short 9 weeks, so TULUM should be ready to launch by April.</p>
<p>The start up costs I need total $15,200.  That includes $9,000 for the app developers I've hired to build the app, $500 to buy the rights to specific photos and drawings, $2400 for three logistics trips to Tulum (scouting, mid-beta test, and final launch test), and $3300 for the first two months of advertising through brochures, tourist magazines and a rented billboard.  After the first two months of sales, the app will be able to pay the advertising costs on its own.</p>
<p><br/>If we over shoot the funding goal, I will use it to increase the advertising scope with another billboard and more ads in tourism info magazines.  Anything left from the campaign after that will be donated to Maya Exploration Center. </p>
<p>If we under shoot the funding goal, I'll take what we've been able to raise and find another way to fund the rest.  Anyone who knows me knows that I will find a way to make this app a reality.</p>
<p>The start-up costs for developing TULUM are modest, the upkeep of the product is minimal and the distribution is virtually free.  Once launched, proceeds from app sales will go to developing more site specific apps and Maya Exploration Center, a non-profit research and education institution that’s been teaching the general public about the ancient Maya and supporting the modern Maya communities for a decade.  When you contribute to the development of the TULUM app, you’re contributing to the appreciation of Maya civilization - past, present and future.</p>
<p>You can contribute as little as $1 and help get the buzz going, but the more you contribute the more you get.  I've made the contribution levels all important Maya numbers just for fun.  If you wonder why that number is important, contribute it and ask me to explain! </p>
<p>I'm offering my 2013 Mayan Calendar wall calendar, MEC t-shirts, Maya astronomy books, and MEC annual memberships as some of the perks, but the largest contributor category will recieve an expenses paid adventure to Tulum to help me test the app live for the first time!  Their feedback will go into the final version and they will be named in the app as its patrons.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>The average tourist who visits Tulum with a desire to learn about its temples and history currently has two options.  They could walk around by themselves or hire a guide.  If they walk around by themselves, they can read the few weather-worn plaques in front of the major structures but they end up leaving with the impression that Tulum is an interesting pile of rocks.  They could hire a guide, but that will cost them $70 for two hours and they’ll hear mostly stories and myths about the site.  The TULUM app will be a third alternative, one that costs only 99¢ and provides them with more information than they could find anywhere else.</p>
<p>The TULUM app will also serve as a pilot program, to find out what works and what its users would like to see more or less of.  The next site specific apps will incorporate those suggestions to make an even better product.  Ultimately, the goal is to make an entire series of apps, letting people be their own guide in a multitude of archaeological sites!</p>

<h1><strong>What makes the Legacy engine Revolutionary?</strong></h1>
<p>The Legacy engine offers tremendous benefits over any existing or development stage engines, and has the potential for significant global impact from:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>• Better fuel economy</em></strong><br/>- 20% More efficient than ANY conventional engine<br/>- Innovative Combustion Geometry<br/>- Saving the average family<strong> $800 per year </strong>in fuel expense</p>
<p><strong><em>• Less Pollution</em></strong><br/>- 20% less fuel is needed to make the same power <br/>- Reduce the amount of carbon emitted by<strong> 8 tons</strong> per vehicle per year for a  long haul tractor trailer. <br/>- Alternative Fuels: Can operate on any fuel including biodiesel, natural gas and hydrogen</p>
<p><strong><em>• Small, lightweight, and powerful </em></strong><br/>- <strong>1/4th</strong> the size and weight of a conventional engine<br/>- Nine combustion cycles per rotation of the drive shaft<br/>- A single rotor Legacy is equivalent to an 18 cylinder four-stroke engine</p>
<p><strong>• Lower Cost </strong><br/>- Cost<strong> 50% less</strong> to manufacture<br/>- Only 12 major components<br/>- No eccentric or reciprocating motion; less vibration &amp; wear<br/>- Simple and adaptable design</p>
<p>These predicted benefits are based on testing, simulation and analysis of the Legacy engine.</p>

<h1><strong>Why is this important to you?</strong></h1>
<p>If you're willing to help us then one day in the not too distant future you might have a Legacy engine in your car. This will effect you in several ways. First your car will cost you a lot less because the Legacy engine cost less than 50% of a current engine. Second, it will save you at least 20% every time you go to the pump, which is about $800.00 a year for a typical family. Third, you will be able to buy a hybrid car that has plenty of power when you need it and plenty of truck room because the Legacy engine is so small and lightweight that the batteries will fit under the hood where they belong! Last but not least, <strong>you will produce a great deal less pollution when you drive a car with a Legacy engine powering it.</strong></p>
<h1>
<strong>Why is this important to everyone</strong>?</h1>
<p>The commercial Legacy engine would provide the marketplace with a more efficient engine.  <strong>The benefits of Legacy’s efficiency would a drastic reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions</strong>, as well as lowering the demand for oil.  In a broader sense, it could reduce the United States’ dependency on foreign oil, provide a technological advantage in a critical market, and lead to the creation of <strong>“green”</strong> jobs.  The core technology and its deployment uses existing infrastructure which will reduce the cost and time of implementation into the marketplace.</p>

<strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong>:</h1>
<p><strong>We need your help to build the GEN002.5X prototype!</strong> This is the next and most critical step in getting the Legacy engine to market. Over the past few years we have successfully addressed many of the technical challenges related to the Legacy engine. Now we need to bring it all together. The GEN002.5X will leverage everything we have learned and will result in a prototype that can be tested for long periods of time. To do this we need to design and fabricate a new housing that can keep the engine cool during these tests. We can do this in less than a year but we need you help to make it happen!</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Fluid flow and heat transfer analysis of Gen002.5X housing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/272/259/d90898105df6eb1843d3307214e4417e_large.jpg?1353442965"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<h1><strong>The Legacy engine technology:</strong></h1>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/169/937/6a43c79da6f32d602fc1c3f95eb3d732_large.jpg?1348159903"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
<p> This animation shows the basic operation of the Legacy engine as well as it major components and how they function.</p>
<div class=""template oembed""> </div>
<p>The Legacy engine is <strong>low speed </strong>high torque planetary engine, comprised of a central rotor and orbiting elements, named rotons. The figure below depicts the Legacy engine configuration, with major components labeled. It also illustrates the combustion processes occurring symmetrically on the three faces of each of the three rotons. These processes enable the Legacy engine to execute nine complete thermodynamic cycles in a single revolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/169/982/84786421a463cd7015811bcbae86511b_large.jpg?1348162447"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Innovative Combustion Geometry: The geometry of the Legacy engine increases the volume of the combustion chamber with shaft rotation differently than conventional piston/crankshaft engines. This yields increased efficiency from the air standard model (described below), by generating higher pressures during the expansion process.</p>
<p>Beyond the gains in efficiency predicted by the air-standard models, the engine geometry also provides a unique combustion chamber and unique combustion process. As the roton reaches the minimum volume position, the working combustion volume is divided into: 1) the leading volume; and 2) the trailing volume, as shown in the adjacent figure.</p>
<p>Fuel is injected into the leading volume after volume division, continuing as the roton moves across the housing peak. The trailing volume contains only compressed air, forced into the leading volume as the roton continues past the housing peak. The compressed air is highly turbulent, being forced through the narrow clearance between the roton and the housing.</p>
<p>This Legacy engine combustion process is enhanced in two ways: 1) the fuel/air mixture in the leading volume is closer to the stoichiometric requirement, enhancing ignition, while the overall operating mixture remains lean (typical of compression ignition); and 2) the highly turbulent air, forced from the trailing volume, promotes mixing, resulting in more efficient combustion.</p>
<p>Inherent Rotary Motion<strong>:</strong> The Legacy engine forces combustion pressure to be applied directly to the output shaft as torque, eliminating the reciprocating-to-rotary mechanism in conventional piston/crankshaft engines. This increases efficiency by avoiding friction loss from thrust loading of the pistons. It also yields improved vibration characteristics and reduces the engine part count.</p>
<p>Aspiration Simplicity: Aspiration of the Legacy engine is accomplished with ports rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, lowering cost and improving reliability.</p>
<p>Engine Component Simplicity: Many Legacy engine components have simple design geometry, surfaces of revolution or extruded profiles. These simple shapes allow the application of advanced ceramic and composite materials, which are less easily used in the complex geometry of conventional engines. The Legacy engine can be configured as “shaft-horizontal” or “shaft-vertical”, increasing design latitude of downstream power transmission components, and packaging options.</p>
<p><strong>Thermodynamic Analysis</strong><br/>The University of Tennessee has performed a thermodynamic analysis using an air-standard cycle with Wiebe function heat addition. This analysis of the Legacy engine was also compared to a crankshaft engine with the same displacement and compression ratio and operating with the same emissions-compliant fuel calibration.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/171/371/ff2dd0657b4034a7f142cec678bb1e63_large.jpg?1348241766"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><br/>The figure above shows modeling results for this comparison. We predict an increase in efficiency of approximately sixteen percent (16%). <br/>Conclusion<br/>Thermodynamic analysis of the Legacy engine predicts – <br/>• An increase in thermal efficiency of approximately 16% over an equivalent crankshaft engine<br/>• Enhanced mixing of the fuel and air due to the unique combustion chamber and unique combustion process should increase the overall efficiency gain to <strong>greater than 20%</strong><br/>• Additional increases in efficiencies can be achieved through continued development and by employing state-of-the-art subsystems currently available.</p>

<br/><strong>Development Efforts To Date</strong>
</h1>
<p>PST has maintained a scientific approach throughout the research and development efforts pertaining to the Legacy engine. To date we have designed, fabricated and tested four iterations of the Legacy engine and have successfully addressed many of the primary technical challenges we face in commercializing the technology. Additional technical challenges exist, but are typical of challenges that must be addressed in any internal combustion engine development programs, and are considered to represent a low level of risk. The following outlines the progress to date. <strong>Testing and evaluation of the Legacy engine are conducted at the University of Tennessee’s Advanced Powertrains, Controls &amp; System Integration (APCSI) automotive research laboratory</strong>.</p>
<h1>
<br/><strong>GEN001 Proof of Geometry</strong>
</h1>
<p>The GEN001 was tested at a rotational speed of 250 rpm, less than typical cranking speed, to avoid damaging the prototype. The data confirmed that seals can function across pressure boundary dividing combustion chamber.</p>

<br/><strong><br/>GEN002.5 Advanced Concept Demonstrator</strong>
</h1>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2010, PST entered into a contract with the National Transportation Research Center, Inc. (NTRCI) to investigate an asymmetric tip seal system and a flush mount fuel injector nozzle for use in the Legacy engine. This effort, funded by the Department of Energy, has validated the functionality of the asymmetric tip seal system as well as the flush mount fuel injector nozzles. The asymmetric tip seal provides a simple solution that will make the Legacy engine easier to manufacture and lower the cost of production. Continued R&amp;D is required to optimize the design but the test results indicate the design is sound and provides the solution to this technical challenge.</p>

<p><strong>The Gen002.5 was tested at the University of Tennessee’s APCSI Test Cell.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions: </strong><br/>•Testing has validated the functionality of the asymmetric tip seal system <br/>•This provides a simple solution that will make the Legacy engine easier to manufacture and lower the cost of production<br/>•Continued R&amp;D is required to optimize the design but the test results demonstrate the design is sound thus removing it as a barrier to market entry<br/><br/><strong>Flush-mount fuel injector nozzle </strong></p>
<p>Conventional fuel injectors protrude into the combustion chamber of a conventional piston engine. This protrusion cannot be accommodated in the Legacy engine since the rotor and rotons pass the fuel injector while in contact with the housing. A flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was designed to address this issue. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/171/400/9ce85921097e3bb76411d2036915b7a3_large.jpg?1348242357"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><br/>The flush-mount nozzle could be readily manufactured by a fuel injector manufacturer, modifying existing conventional injector nozzles was a cost effective way to demonstrate the viability of the concept. This modification required welding additional material onto the existing nozzle, machining the resulting nozzle to the required size and contour to match the housing, and producing the small holes to the size and orientation required for the GEN2.5B.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/171/401/5fdf93904484f2571726c12b6f3b1480_large.jpg?1348242390"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was successfully developed and demonstrated at a fuel pressure of 12000 psi. Further development in combustion optimization requires continued research and development of the fuel injection system.</p>
<p><strong>Induction and exhaust system optimization</strong><br/>The Legacy engine relies on scavenging of the exhaust to introduce the fresh charge, similar to a two-stroke conventional engine. Aspiration of the Legacy Engine is accomplished with ports, in an aspiration plate, rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, which lowers cost and improves reliability. To realize these benefits of port induction and exhaust, optimal intake and exhaust port design are absolutely critical to the performance of the engine.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/171/402/4bc27a09b646a311ce7b8add555373b9_large.jpg?1348242416"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>PST has evaluated induction and exhaust performance of three aspiration plate designs to develop optimal inlet and exhaust port geometry for the Legacy GEN2.5 Advanced Concept Demonstrator. This effort was funded by NTRCI through a Department of Transportation grant awarded to PST. This effort resulted in an aspiration plate that optimizes the induction and exhaust for the GEN2.5B Legacy engine prototype, allowing for development and commercialization efforts to move forward. Further development is required; however, the results demonstrate that there are significant opportunities to increase the performance of the Legacy engine.</p>
<h1><strong>Next Steps – GEN002.5X Stand Alone Demonstrator</strong></h1>
<p>The next steps in the development process will leverage the existing GEN002.5 prototype. This will minimize both time and investment required to move the commercialization effort forward. The GEN002.5B can be modified to incorporate all the features necessary for “stand alone” operation. The first step is to produce a new housing with built in cooling feature and then integrating the subsystems such as a radiator, turbo/super charger, etc... into Gen002.5X. This will provide the information that will guild the design of the GEN003 prototype.</p>
<p><br/><em>Thermal Management</em><br/>Increased cooling demands are integral with unparalleled power density and high power to volume ratios. Providing the required cooling for such a compact engine design is a challenge that requires an innovative approach to both the cooling system and the various materials in the engine.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/170/393/1e90a0e473dd3112f39a8256dc65bfab_large.jpg?1348175971"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><em>Combustion Optimization</em></p>
<p>Combustion optimization is the key to the increased efficiency predicted by our modeling and simulation. The unique geometry of the Legacy engine introduces thermodynamic processes that are unlike any other engine. This provides the opportunity to optimize the combustion processes and gain additional efficiencies beyond what is possible in a conventional engine. This is due to the manner in which the working volume changes as a function of the rotation of the engine.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/171/746/49c399423fb0ebd66ca2ed031d822953_large.jpg?1348255613"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>The images (above) illustrate the unique thermodynamic processes of the Legacy engine. </strong></p>
<p>Additionally, the combustion chamber is divided into two separate volumes, shown in the figures below. Fuel is injected into the leading volume and as the engine rotates, air is forced from the trailing volume into the leading volume creating high turbulence and improved mixing. Improved mixing will result in improved combustion and lower emissions. Software exists for conventional diesel engines, and it will be modified and enhanced for the unique geometry of the Legacy engine. The model will be calibrated, based on empirical data obtained from dynamometer evaluation of the prototypes, throughout the development phases of the project.  Because the software and expertise currently exist to address these issues, combustion optimization does not pose a risk to commercialization.</p>

<p><strong><em>Controls</em></strong></p>
<p>The prototype engine control system used thus far is fairly simple. It is capable of controlling the fuel injection parameters at single operating points. The injection timing and duration are real-time user inputs to the control software. For continued development of the Legacy engine, a more production-like control system must be developed that calculates and changes the control parameters based on sensor inputs.</p>
<p>However for the purposes of near term continuation of the development program the current engine control system can be used for the initial calibration of the proposed GEN002.5X.</p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>The GEN002.5X will leverage everything we have learned and will result in a prototype that can be tested for long periods of time. To do this we need to design and fabricate a new housing to cool the engine cool during these tests. If we meet our stretch goals we will also package all of the subsystems making it a “stand-alone” prototype engine. The work that will be completed in this project will consist of bringing together the technologies that we have already validated, designing and fabricating a cooling jacket and integrating it into the Gen002.5B. The next step will be integrating “off the shelf” subsystems such as a radiator, turbo or super charger to make the Legacy Gen2.5X a ""stand alone"" prototype. This effort represents a lower technical risk than our previous projects because it does not involve the development of new technologies. However as with all research and development efforts, there is the risk of unforeseen challenges that may impede the effort. The commercialization of a new technology, in particular a new engine technology, is a very expensive and time consuming endeavor. It is a difficult task for the largest of companies and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in bringing the Legacy engine to market. This is why we have spent years developing a team of experts (See Bios above) and a research and business network (see above) that are second to none. We felt this was the perfect project to share because we are not working on proprietary designs so it will allow full disclosure of information in real time which will let our backers to have a front row seat throughout the project.</p>
<p>Future Technical Challenges: <br/>The development of a functioning stand-alone engine is a critical step in the development of the Legacy engine, however there are additional challenges that must be addressed in order to commercialize the technology. These identified technical challenges will be addressed in the development of the Gen 003 and 004 prototypes. The development and testing of the Gen002.5X is critical to the design of the Gen003 and is the necessary next step.</p>
<p>Numerous other challenges exist but are typical of challenges that must be addressed in any internal combustion engine development program. <br/>Key areas of required research and development include:</p>
<p>Induction and exhaust optimization <br/>o The Legacy engine relies on scavenging of the exhaust to introduce the fresh charge, similar to a two-stroke conventional engine. Aspiration of the Legacy Engine is accomplished with ports rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, which lowers cost and improves reliability.

<p>Combustion Optimization <br/>o Combustion optimization is the key to the increased efficiency predicted by our modeling and simulation. The unique geometry of the Legacy engine provides the opportunity to optimize the combustion processes and gain additional efficiencies beyond what is possible in a conventional engine. Additionally, the combustion chamber is divided into two separate volumes as illustrated in Figure 36 on page 27. Fuel is injected into the leading volume and as the engine rotates air is forced from the trailing volume into the leading volume creating high turbulence and improved mixing. Improved mixing will result in improved combustion and lower emissions.</p>
<p>Thermal management <br/>Increased cooling demands are integral with unparalleled power density and high power to volume ratios. Providing the required cooling for such a compact engine design is an extreme challenge that requires an innovative approach to both the cooling system and the various materials in the engine.</p>

<p>Fuel injection: While the flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was successfully developed and demonstrated on this project, further development in combustion optimization requires research and development of the fuel injection system. Particularly, emissions compliance for compression ignition engines depends heavily on optimizing the injection parameters (timing, duration, pressure, orifice size, etc.).</p>
<p>Conclusions <br/>Successful completion of research and development in the listed areas will lead to validation of the predicted improvements in efficiency and will provide the foundation necessary for commercialization the Legacy engine.</p></div>","The Legacy engine is a revolutionary new type of internal combustion engine. 


Legacy Gen002.5B Prototype Assembled

Legacy Gen 002.5B Prototype at the University of Tennessee’s Advanced Powertrains, Controls & System Integration (APCSI) automotive research lab
What makes the Legacy engine Revolutionary?
The Legacy engine offers tremendous benefits over any existing or development stage engines, and has the potential for significant global impact from:
 
• Better fuel economy- 20% More efficient than ANY conventional engine- Innovative Combustion Geometry- Saving the average family $800 per year in fuel expense
• Less Pollution- 20% less fuel is needed to make the same power - Reduce the amount of carbon emitted by 8 tons per vehicle per year for a  long haul tractor trailer. - Alternative Fuels: Can operate on any fuel including biodiesel, natural gas and hydrogen
• Small, lightweight, and powerful - 1/4th the size and weight of a conventional engine- Nine combustion cycles per rotation of the drive shaft- A single rotor Legacy is equivalent to an 18 cylinder four-stroke engine
• Lower Cost - Cost 50% less to manufacture- Only 12 major components- No eccentric or reciprocating motion; less vibration & wear- Simple and adaptable design
These predicted benefits are based on testing, simulation and analysis of the Legacy engine.



Why is this important to you?
If you're willing to help us then one day in the not too distant future you might have a Legacy engine in your car. This will effect you in several ways. First your car will cost you a lot less because the Legacy engine cost less than 50% of a current engine. Second, it will save you at least 20% every time you go to the pump, which is about $800.00 a year for a typical family. Third, you will be able to buy a hybrid car that has plenty of power when you need it and plenty of truck room because the Legacy engine is so small and lightweight that the batteries will fit under the hood where they belong! Last but not least, you will produce a great deal less pollution when you drive a car with a Legacy engine powering it.

Why is this important to everyone?
The commercial Legacy engine would provide the marketplace with a more efficient engine.  The benefits of Legacy’s efficiency would a drastic reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions, as well as lowering the demand for oil.  In a broader sense, it could reduce the United States’ dependency on foreign oil, provide a technological advantage in a critical market, and lead to the creation of “green” jobs.  The core technology and its deployment uses existing infrastructure which will reduce the cost and time of implementation into the marketplace.

The GEN002.5X will leverage everything we have learned and will result in a prototype that can be tested for long periods of time. To do this we need to design and fabricate a new housing that can keep the engine cool during these tests. We can do this in less than a year but we need you help to make it happen!

Fluid flow and heat transfer analysis of Gen002.5X housing
The following shows the design and fabrication of the Gen2.5B housing. This is similar to our project but much more simple. The Gen2.5X housing design will incorporate information from our fluid flow and heat transfer analysis (shown above) to insure it can dissipate the heat created during combustion testing.

The Legacy engine technology:

How Does it Work?
 This animation shows the basic operation of the Legacy engine as well as it major components and how they function.
 
The Legacy engine is low speed high torque planetary engine, comprised of a central rotor and orbiting elements, named rotons. The figure below depicts the Legacy engine configuration, with major components labeled. It also illustrates the combustion processes occurring symmetrically on the three faces of each of the three rotons. These processes enable the Legacy engine to execute nine complete thermodynamic cycles in a single revolution.
 

Innovative Combustion Geometry: The geometry of the Legacy engine increases the volume of the combustion chamber with shaft rotation differently than conventional piston/crankshaft engines. This yields increased efficiency from the air standard model (described below), by generating higher pressures during the expansion process.
Beyond the gains in efficiency predicted by the air-standard models, the engine geometry also provides a unique combustion chamber and unique combustion process. As the roton reaches the minimum volume position, the working combustion volume is divided into: 1) the leading volume; and 2) the trailing volume, as shown in the adjacent figure.
Fuel is injected into the leading volume after volume division, continuing as the roton moves across the housing peak. The trailing volume contains only compressed air, forced into the leading volume as the roton continues past the housing peak. The compressed air is highly turbulent, being forced through the narrow clearance between the roton and the housing.
This Legacy engine combustion process is enhanced in two ways: 1) the fuel/air mixture in the leading volume is closer to the stoichiometric requirement, enhancing ignition, while the overall operating mixture remains lean (typical of compression ignition); and 2) the highly turbulent air, forced from the trailing volume, promotes mixing, resulting in more efficient combustion.
Inherent Rotary Motion: The Legacy engine forces combustion pressure to be applied directly to the output shaft as torque, eliminating the reciprocating-to-rotary mechanism in conventional piston/crankshaft engines. This increases efficiency by avoiding friction loss from thrust loading of the pistons. It also yields improved vibration characteristics and reduces the engine part count.
Aspiration Simplicity: Aspiration of the Legacy engine is accomplished with ports rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, lowering cost and improving reliability.
Engine Component Simplicity: Many Legacy engine components have simple design geometry, surfaces of revolution or extruded profiles. These simple shapes allow the application of advanced ceramic and composite materials, which are less easily used in the complex geometry of conventional engines. The Legacy engine can be configured as “shaft-horizontal” or “shaft-vertical”, increasing design latitude of downstream power transmission components, and packaging options.
Thermodynamic AnalysisThe University of Tennessee has performed a thermodynamic analysis using an air-standard cycle with Wiebe function heat addition. This analysis of the Legacy engine was also compared to a crankshaft engine with the same displacement and compression ratio and operating with the same emissions-compliant fuel calibration.

The figure above shows modeling results for this comparison. We predict an increase in efficiency of approximately sixteen percent (16%). ConclusionThermodynamic analysis of the Legacy engine predicts – • An increase in thermal efficiency of approximately 16% over an equivalent crankshaft engine• Enhanced mixing of the fuel and air due to the unique combustion chamber and unique combustion process should increase the overall efficiency gain to greater than 20%• Additional increases in efficiencies can be achieved through continued development and by employing state-of-the-art subsystems currently available.


Development Efforts To Date

PST has maintained a scientific approach throughout the research and development efforts pertaining to the Legacy engine. To date we have designed, fabricated and tested four iterations of the Legacy engine and have successfully addressed many of the primary technical challenges we face in commercializing the technology. Additional technical challenges exist, but are typical of challenges that must be addressed in any internal combustion engine development programs, and are considered to represent a low level of risk. The following outlines the progress to date. Testing and evaluation of the Legacy engine are conducted at the University of Tennessee’s Advanced Powertrains, Controls & System Integration (APCSI) automotive research laboratory.

GEN001 Proof of Geometry

The GEN001 was tested at a rotational speed of 250 rpm, less than typical cranking speed, to avoid damaging the prototype. The data confirmed that seals can function across pressure boundary dividing combustion chamber.

GEN002 Proof of Concept
The GEN002 validated the viability of the Legacy engine and provided a clear path forward. Lessons learned guided further development.

GEN002.5 Advanced Concept Demonstrator

In the fourth quarter of 2010, PST entered into a contract with the National Transportation Research Center, Inc. (NTRCI) to investigate an asymmetric tip seal system and a flush mount fuel injector nozzle for use in the Legacy engine. This effort, funded by the Department of Energy, has validated the functionality of the asymmetric tip seal system as well as the flush mount fuel injector nozzles. The asymmetric tip seal provides a simple solution that will make the Legacy engine easier to manufacture and lower the cost of production. Continued R&D is required to optimize the design but the test results indicate the design is sound and provides the solution to this technical challenge.


Data Aquisition

Fuel pump and Injectors
The roton tip seal represented the key technical challenge to the commercialization of the Legacy engine however; a solution to this challenge has been developed and successfully tested. 

The asymmetric tip seal system was integrated into the GEN002, now designated the GEN002.5A & B.


The Gen002.5 was tested at the University of Tennessee’s APCSI Test Cell.
Conclusions: •Testing has validated the functionality of the asymmetric tip seal system •This provides a simple solution that will make the Legacy engine easier to manufacture and lower the cost of production•Continued R&D is required to optimize the design but the test results demonstrate the design is sound thus removing it as a barrier to market entryFlush-mount fuel injector nozzle 
Conventional fuel injectors protrude into the combustion chamber of a conventional piston engine. This protrusion cannot be accommodated in the Legacy engine since the rotor and rotons pass the fuel injector while in contact with the housing. A flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was designed to address this issue. 

The flush-mount nozzle could be readily manufactured by a fuel injector manufacturer, modifying existing conventional injector nozzles was a cost effective way to demonstrate the viability of the concept. This modification required welding additional material onto the existing nozzle, machining the resulting nozzle to the required size and contour to match the housing, and producing the small holes to the size and orientation required for the GEN2.5B.

The flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was successfully developed and demonstrated at a fuel pressure of 12000 psi. Further development in combustion optimization requires continued research and development of the fuel injection system.
Induction and exhaust system optimizationThe Legacy engine relies on scavenging of the exhaust to introduce the fresh charge, similar to a two-stroke conventional engine. Aspiration of the Legacy Engine is accomplished with ports, in an aspiration plate, rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, which lowers cost and improves reliability. To realize these benefits of port induction and exhaust, optimal intake and exhaust port design are absolutely critical to the performance of the engine.

PST has evaluated induction and exhaust performance of three aspiration plate designs to develop optimal inlet and exhaust port geometry for the Legacy GEN2.5 Advanced Concept Demonstrator. This effort was funded by NTRCI through a Department of Transportation grant awarded to PST. This effort resulted in an aspiration plate that optimizes the induction and exhaust for the GEN2.5B Legacy engine prototype, allowing for development and commercialization efforts to move forward. Further development is required; however, the results demonstrate that there are significant opportunities to increase the performance of the Legacy engine.
Next Steps – GEN002.5X Stand Alone Demonstrator
The next steps in the development process will leverage the existing GEN002.5 prototype. This will minimize both time and investment required to move the commercialization effort forward. The GEN002.5B can be modified to incorporate all the features necessary for “stand alone” operation. The first step is to produce a new housing with built in cooling feature and then integrating the subsystems such as a radiator, turbo/super charger, etc... into Gen002.5X. This will provide the information that will guild the design of the GEN003 prototype.
Thermal ManagementIncreased cooling demands are integral with unparalleled power density and high power to volume ratios. Providing the required cooling for such a compact engine design is a challenge that requires an innovative approach to both the cooling system and the various materials in the engine.

Combustion Optimization
Combustion optimization is the key to the increased efficiency predicted by our modeling and simulation. The unique geometry of the Legacy engine introduces thermodynamic processes that are unlike any other engine. This provides the opportunity to optimize the combustion processes and gain additional efficiencies beyond what is possible in a conventional engine. This is due to the manner in which the working volume changes as a function of the rotation of the engine.

The images (above) illustrate the unique thermodynamic processes of the Legacy engine. 
Additionally, the combustion chamber is divided into two separate volumes, shown in the figures below. Fuel is injected into the leading volume and as the engine rotates, air is forced from the trailing volume into the leading volume creating high turbulence and improved mixing. Improved mixing will result in improved combustion and lower emissions. Software exists for conventional diesel engines, and it will be modified and enhanced for the unique geometry of the Legacy engine. The model will be calibrated, based on empirical data obtained from dynamometer evaluation of the prototypes, throughout the development phases of the project.  Because the software and expertise currently exist to address these issues, combustion optimization does not pose a risk to commercialization.
 


Controls
The prototype engine control system used thus far is fairly simple. It is capable of controlling the fuel injection parameters at single operating points. The injection timing and duration are real-time user inputs to the control software. For continued development of the Legacy engine, a more production-like control system must be developed that calculates and changes the control parameters based on sensor inputs.
However for the purposes of near term continuation of the development program the current engine control system can be used for the initial calibration of the proposed GEN002.5X.

Risks and challenges
The GEN002.5X will leverage everything we have learned and will result in a prototype that can be tested for long periods of time. To do this we need to design and fabricate a new housing to cool the engine cool during these tests. If we meet our stretch goals we will also package all of the subsystems making it a “stand-alone” prototype engine. The work that will be completed in this project will consist of bringing together the technologies that we have already validated, designing and fabricating a cooling jacket and integrating it into the Gen002.5B. The next step will be integrating “off the shelf” subsystems such as a radiator, turbo or super charger to make the Legacy Gen2.5X a ""stand alone"" prototype. This effort represents a lower technical risk than our previous projects because it does not involve the development of new technologies. However as with all research and development efforts, there is the risk of unforeseen challenges that may impede the effort. The commercialization of a new technology, in particular a new engine technology, is a very expensive and time consuming endeavor. It is a difficult task for the largest of companies and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in bringing the Legacy engine to market. This is why we have spent years developing a team of experts (See Bios above) and a research and business network (see above) that are second to none. We felt this was the perfect project to share because we are not working on proprietary designs so it will allow full disclosure of information in real time which will let our backers to have a front row seat throughout the project.
Future Technical Challenges: The development of a functioning stand-alone engine is a critical step in the development of the Legacy engine, however there are additional challenges that must be addressed in order to commercialize the technology. These identified technical challenges will be addressed in the development of the Gen 003 and 004 prototypes. The development and testing of the Gen002.5X is critical to the design of the Gen003 and is the necessary next step.
Numerous other challenges exist but are typical of challenges that must be addressed in any internal combustion engine development program. Key areas of required research and development include:
Induction and exhaust optimization o The Legacy engine relies on scavenging of the exhaust to introduce the fresh charge, similar to a two-stroke conventional engine. Aspiration of the Legacy Engine is accomplished with ports rather than valves. This eliminates a complex subsystem, which lowers cost and improves reliability. To realize these benefits of port induction and exhaust, optimal intake and exhaust port design are absolutely critical to the performance of the engine.
Combustion Optimization o Combustion optimization is the key to the increased efficiency predicted by our modeling and simulation. The unique geometry of the Legacy engine provides the opportunity to optimize the combustion processes and gain additional efficiencies beyond what is possible in a conventional engine. Additionally, the combustion chamber is divided into two separate volumes as illustrated in Figure 36 on page 27. Fuel is injected into the leading volume and as the engine rotates air is forced from the trailing volume into the leading volume creating high turbulence and improved mixing. Improved mixing will result in improved combustion and lower emissions.
Thermal management Increased cooling demands are integral with unparalleled power density and high power to volume ratios. Providing the required cooling for such a compact engine design is an extreme challenge that requires an innovative approach to both the cooling system and the various materials in the engine.
Subsystem Development Controls: The prototype engine control system used thus far is fairly simple. It is capable of controlling the fuel injection parameters at single operating points. The injection timing and duration are real-time user inputs to the control software. For continued development of the Legacy engine, a more production-like control system must be developed that calculates and changes the control parameters based on sensor inputs.
Fuel injection: While the flush-mount fuel injector nozzle was successfully developed and demonstrated on this project, further development in combustion optimization requires research and development of the fuel injection system. Particularly, emissions compliance for compression ignition engines depends heavily on optimizing the injection parameters (timing, duration, pressure, orifice size, etc.).
Conclusions Successful completion of research and development in the listed areas will lead to validation of the predicted improvements in efficiency and will provide the foundation necessary for commercialization the Legacy engine.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p></figure></div><p>The Input Club Keystone Mechanical Keyboard is an unparalleled leap forward in typing and gaming technology. It combines two new features — High Definition Analog Control and per-key Hall Effect (magnetic) sensing — for supreme performance. Put simply, each key can indicate how far it has been pressed down. This pressure sensitivity enables remarkable flexibility in games, artistic programs, and general computing tasks. Its underlying hot-swap SILO switches allow for near-infinite customization, billion-press durability (20x the industry standard), and HD Analog Control for everyone.</p><p>Fully programmable Open Source firmware and advanced RGB lighting help the Keystone stand out. We expect this technology stack (and open source adaptations) to show up in all high-quality keyboards over the next few years.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""25818949""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566496807/koqn5rjjy8mot8dhmd8l.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""25792291""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566496808/txud5cyfwjwfazufm7lh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>Hall Effect switches use magnetic field strength to track key movement. This is substantially better than traditional bent-metal contacts in every way. You can adjust how far a key must be pressed to output a letter, sense a key like an analog game controller stick, and gain better overall physical performance (see <a href=""https://sensing.honeywell.com/hallbook.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>this technical document</strong></a> from Honeywell, an original patent holder). You can even have an action tied to a half-press or bottom out — anything in between works too!</p><p>Low friction Hall Effect switches can last for billions of presses. Their astonishing longevity and smoothness can be traced to one design element: the lack of physical electrical contacts, which continuously degrade in normal switches. Cost, old sensor designs, and lack of innovation kept Hall Effect switches out of modern keyboards until a few months ago.

<p> </p></figure></div><p><strong>Analog tech offers a better, more feature rich future.</strong> Standard keyboards use digital sensing, which results in an ON or OFF signal (1 or 0). Analog technology is more like a gas pedal — it reads every position between those extremes. CAD applications, games involving movement, and drone controls are just a few of the infinite applications of analog technology. Our Open Source firmware means that the Keystone can be adapted to practically any purpose, which is why it’s so groundbreaking.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/780/150/68ebae178b5028e4e1a72e482761c3c7_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1562886902&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2cad281628c54fc8667a2a8af5481850"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""25780150""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><p>We expect video games to receive the most immediate attention. Console games make heavy use of analog input for variable movement, which hasn’t always translated well to mouse and keyboard setups. Most PC gamers have been stuck with digital input — a fairly unnatural way to play (like a toggle for run, or pressing the W key multiple times to move at less than full speed). The Keystone’s analog switches do away with that jittery movement while outperforming existing analog tech across the board.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""25828803""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566496812/vber1oi9jlchcrsi9h62.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>Artists, creators, and engineers also have an opportunity to engage with HD Analog Control. An API extension would allow brush size changes, variable timeline scrolling speeds, and 3D object control. Analog keyboards will make pressure-sensitive input accessible for the first time, unlocking a new world of human-computer interaction. We’ve created a few powerful use cases, but the most important thing we’re doing with the Keystone is open sourcing its software code so anyone can build on our work.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/781/128/6cd57b8ed1d6a04fa90a9633e0c7e440_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1562894571&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8e65f3feb8ca57bf3778c93007a74182"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""25781128""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""25818995""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566496813/hhw0xtevqcvcq1abvs89.png"" src=""""/></p>

Unfortunately, interface hardware tends to have frustrating limitations that ruin immersion — the ability to shift your mind into a game’s reality. Analog keyboards remove many of those pain points. Analog keys can control player speed, intuitively stack build options in games like Fortnite, or control stand/crouch/prone positions via a single key. The tech offers so many benefits that digital keyboards will inevitably die out (at least for gamers).  </p><p> </p><div data-id=""25819006""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1566496817/xye1kcw5yslwcrsulkqf.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/780/712/7b042e3310bbb04885ec4b9570c01d32_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1562890924&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=fc08a1ff6992aeb8f1c1e44f63925523"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Artists and creators always struggle with computers.

Generic models look cheap, lack modern features, and wear down easily — they’re passive plastic bricks. Your next keyboard should actively work with you to improve speed, performance, and accuracy. It should use AI to augment your typing style, offer per-key analog control in games, and contain the absolute best technology available.Input Club’s Keystone brings the future to your desk. Comfort, durability, and beauty complement its compatibility with all major operating systems. Keystone will grant you precise control and usher in a new era of keyboarding.

 The Input Club Keystone Mechanical Keyboard is an unparalleled leap forward in typing and gaming technology. It combines two new features — High Definition Analog Control and per-key Hall Effect (magnetic) sensing — for supreme performance. Put simply, each key can indicate how far it has been pressed down. This pressure sensitivity enables remarkable flexibility in games, artistic programs, and general computing tasks. Its underlying hot-swap SILO switches allow for near-infinite customization, billion-press durability (20x the industry standard), and HD Analog Control for everyone.Fully programmable Open Source firmware and advanced RGB lighting help the Keystone stand out. We expect this technology stack (and open source adaptations) to show up in all high-quality keyboards over the next few years.  
 Hall Effect switches use magnetic field strength to track key movement. This is substantially better than traditional bent-metal contacts in every way. You can adjust how far a key must be pressed to output a letter, sense a key like an analog game controller stick, and gain better overall physical performance (see this technical document from Honeywell, an original patent holder). You can even have an action tied to a half-press or bottom out — anything in between works too!Low friction Hall Effect switches can last for billions of presses. Their astonishing longevity and smoothness can be traced to one design element: the lack of physical electrical contacts, which continuously degrade in normal switches. Cost, old sensor designs, and lack of innovation kept Hall Effect switches out of modern keyboards until a few months ago. A few vintage keyboards used limited implementations of the tech in mission critical computers, but that’s about it. 
 
 Hot-swappable SILO switches make it easy to change your keyboard’s sound and feel. They’re contactless, so you can pull them out and replace them with different SILO switches at will. There’s no real limit to the number of times you can swap between switches — this is a significant advantage over delicate contact based hot-swap sockets. Linear (Red Slider), Quiet Tactile (Tan Slider), and Clicky Beam Spring (Blue Slider) switches will be available — to see a visual representation of our prototypes’ feel, check out their force curves on Kono’s Keystone page. Please note that we’re targeting light to medium spring resistance numbers; there will be some adjustments. SILO switches support Cherry MX-mount keycaps from all manufacturers. You will configure your Keystone and select your switch on Kono Store after the campaign closes. If you’re not sure which one to get, take a look at this short guide to switch selection.  
 Analog tech offers a better, more feature rich future. Standard keyboards use digital sensing, which results in an ON or OFF signal (1 or 0). Analog technology is more like a gas pedal — it reads every position between those extremes. CAD applications, games involving movement, and drone controls are just a few of the infinite applications of analog technology. Our Open Source firmware means that the Keystone can be adapted to practically any purpose, which is why it’s so groundbreaking.  We expect video games to receive the most immediate attention. Console games make heavy use of analog input for variable movement, which hasn’t always translated well to mouse and keyboard setups. Most PC gamers have been stuck with digital input — a fairly unnatural way to play (like a toggle for run, or pressing the W key multiple times to move at less than full speed). The Keystone’s analog switches do away with that jittery movement while outperforming existing analog tech across the board. 
 Artists, creators, and engineers also have an opportunity to engage with HD Analog Control. An API extension would allow brush size changes, variable timeline scrolling speeds, and 3D object control. Analog keyboards will make pressure-sensitive input accessible for the first time, unlocking a new world of human-computer interaction. We’ve created a few powerful use cases, but the most important thing we’re doing with the Keystone is open sourcing its software code so anyone can build on our work.  
 Adaptive Typing AI offers significant comfort improvements for typists. Everyone has different wrist, hand, and finger sizes — even when comparing their own appendages. The Keystone keeps track of how hard and far you tend to press each key using HD Analog Sensing. After a few hundred presses, your keyboard can automatically tweak how far you need to push a key down before sending a signal to your computer. This accounts for all typing styles, whether you bottom out or float over the keys, and puts less stress on non-central fingers like the pinky. It will also sync well with AI-Driven Autocomplete systems; you could hold a key down to complete a word or sentence once those integrations become more common.    Video games allow us to interact with the digital world in ways that delight and amaze us. Unfortunately, interface hardware tends to have frustrating limitations that ruin immersion — the ability to shift your mind into a game’s reality. Analog keyboards remove many of those pain points. Analog keys can control player speed, intuitively stack build options in games like Fortnite, or control stand/crouch/prone positions via a single key. The tech offers so many benefits that digital keyboards will inevitably die out (at least for gamers).     Artists and creators always struggle with computers. Countless peripherals attempt to address input limitations, but none of them really add value to the base keyboard and mouse system. Tablets and other devices are useful, but macros and hand movements are still a unique mess across most professional software suites.Input Club creates programmable keyboards, like the Keystone, to ensure that any key can be assigned any function or macro on multiple layers. The Keystone expands those capabilities with analog control. Creating a layer for your program can be useful, but half-hold macros and pressure-sensitive brush sizing (or playhead scrubbing) keys are entirely possible. This simplifies workflow and brings you closer to your end product. 
 Our team of keyboard enthusiasts is dedicated to pushing the keyboard industry forward, and we’ve been doing so for the last 4 years with Kono Store (our distributor). We released and shipped two crowdfunding campaigns — Kira and WhiteFox — which led us to Keystone.This is the keyboard that we’ve been waiting to make; it’s the reason we formed Input Club. Our work with Kaihua (Kailh), a major switch manufacturer, connected us with the factories, engineering resources, and economies of scale necessary to make Keystone.

Do you strive to keep track of your master pieces scattered among a huge pile of sketch books? How can you share your ideas without carrying your whole art portfolio?A typical school uses 2000 sheets of paper a day and an art school can easily triple the amount of waste. You know practice makes perfect but you are also worried about the waste you produce and how it could damage the environment. It’s time to go digital.Getting a digital drawing tablet will solve all the problems said. No more paper sketches, no more carrying of big backpacks and a lot less waste. However, here comes a new problem – a good graphic tablet costs hundreds of dollars. Where to you find the funding as a student? Simbans has a solution for you - PicassoTab. We are creating the world’s first budget Android drawing tablet that is compatible with active pen and has palm rejection.  The light-weight tablet operates on its own and does not require connection with the computer when you draw so there is no need to worry about buying a powerful computer device in addition to paying for the graphic drawing tablet. In addition to its drawing capability, PicassoTab functions like any other Android tablets. You can use it for notes-taking, entertainment, games, photo-taking, presentations and more! --  What is special about Simbans pen? -- An active pen is an input device that includes electronic components and allows users to write directly onto the LCD screen surface of a computing device. This means that you will see a cursor on the screen when you hover over the pen on the screen. An active pen is NOT a passive stylus, which only work when actually touching the screen.Simbans active pen supports 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity, differentiates between pen and finger touch and detects the pen hovering above the display. Moreover, PicassoTab surface has palm rejection feature, i.e. finger/ hand touch will be ignored when the pen is in range. Other FeaturesAndroid 7.0 NougatRunning Android 7.0 Nougat, you can download and install as many games and tools as you want on the PicassoTab.

<p class=""big_type"">Using patented MIMICS technology, the Inner Voice app gives individuals with autism the opportunity to speak for themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class=""full-description"">
<h1><strong>We Need Your Help!</strong></h1>
<p>We've spent years designing, researching and developing MIMICS: mobile interactive mirror neuron-stimulating improvisational cueing system. We're working on developing an advanced prototype, which can be developed into a product, targeted at the millions of people worldwide who have autism. Despite all of our clinical successes with initial prototypes, we now need your help to bring this amazing technology to national and international markets so that larger populations may benefit from this exciting development.</p>
<h1><strong>Why We're Doing This</strong></h1>
<p>The worldwide market is very robust for apps targeting autism, due to a 289.5% increase in the disorder. In fact, one in 50 children is being diagnosed on the spectrum.  An estimated 40% of individuals diagnosed with autism will be non-verbal and 75%-85% of people on the spectrum will struggle with echolalia or repetitive speech.  The need for cost-effective therapies, apps, and other interventions will continue to grow rapidly worldwide. We believe that creativity, science, and unconventional thinking are keys to providing tools that will improve communication and socialization skills for people on the spectrum. Both of us noticed that the autism app market is filled with conventional products -- most involve touching an icon, which produces speech. </p>
<p>So we asked a question: what if we could animate images of users so that they could teach themselves how to communicate and interact socially with others? The answer is we can -- and it works!</p>

<h1>Product Details </h1>
<p>By incorporating photograph-based avatars into a conversation, the computer device’s screen could encourage people with autism to attend to faces for social-communicative cues. In fact, current research shows video modeling is an effective tool for teaching people with autism. But MIMICS is different: it features <em><strong>interactive</strong></em> video self-modeling, using animated self-avatars (digital characters which incorporate the user’s face). In our invention, the avatars serve as electronic diplomats – which pique the interest of people with autism and, thus, stimulate dialogue between neurotypical and autistic individuals.</p>

We Need Your Help!
We've spent years designing, researching and developing MIMICS: mobile interactive mirror neuron-stimulating improvisational cueing system. We're working on developing an advanced prototype, which can be developed into a product, targeted at the millions of people worldwide who have autism. Despite all of our clinical successes with initial prototypes, we now need your help to bring this amazing technology to national and international markets so that larger populations may benefit from this exciting development.
Why We're Doing This
The worldwide market is very robust for apps targeting autism, due to a 289.5% increase in the disorder. In fact, one in 50 children is being diagnosed on the spectrum.  An estimated 40% of individuals diagnosed with autism will be non-verbal and 75%-85% of people on the spectrum will struggle with echolalia or repetitive speech.  The need for cost-effective therapies, apps, and other interventions will continue to grow rapidly worldwide. We believe that creativity, science, and unconventional thinking are keys to providing tools that will improve communication and socialization skills for people on the spectrum. Both of us noticed that the autism app market is filled with conventional products -- most involve touching an icon, which produces speech. 
So we asked a question: what if we could animate images of users so that they could teach themselves how to communicate and interact socially with others? The answer is we can -- and it works!
How Your Contribution Will Help Us
·Create a MIMICS app for multiple platforms and develop a prototype, which features mobile cueing technology
·Obtain Bluetooth and facial recognition software licenses
·Translate InnerVoice for international markets
·Offer the products on Google Play and iTunes
·In exchange for your support, we have a number of unique perks!

<p>In the field of ABA (applied behavior analysis), treatment decisions are driven by data. In order for our clients to receive optimal treatment -  to make growth in the areas of communication, social skills, academics, and overall independence - we spend countless (often unpaid) hours reviewing research, updating goals, creating data sheets, graphing and interpreting session data.</p>
<p>ABAdesk came to be when my significant other, a developer, and I joined forces to solve a problem that many others in my field face - overextending ourselves in order to do right by our clients. I thought, ""There must be an easier way to provide optimal treatment; I'd love to put my energy where it belongs - my client interactions.""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>ABAdesk has been in development for over a year and is currently in Beta Testing. We are getting closer to launch, but underestimated the cost of being HIPAA compliant. We  are planning to go live by the New Year (January 1st, 2019). As we get our code up to code to ensure that ABAdesk exceeds performance and security standards, we are saving our money and gathering funding to pay for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Login Service</li>
<li>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Record Storage </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>ABAdesk going live will help professionals all over the country make lasting change in the lives of their learners. They'll be able to quickly set up and collect data, and make treatment decisions based on the facts. Additionally, they will save time with program updates, as most of the work is done during the setup process, and automation does the rest!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Launching software from the ground up has its challenges. Although we are almost certain we will be ready to launch by January 1st, 2019, and will work our very hardest to meet that deadline, unanticipated hurdles may occur. We will keep you updated every step of the way.</p>

The idea is simple.  Disrupt mass surveillance by creating enormous amounts of data.  Data will be disguised to be indecipherable from actual conversations.  Disruption will occur over all primary forms of communication:
Email
Phone Calls

Text Messaging
Web Browsing
The organization will be structured similar to a non-profit.  We are are not here to profit.  Our goal is to disrupt and put an end to the violation of our rights.What We Need 

All funding will go towards application development.  

If we do not reach our goal funds will go towards developing applications to disrupt at least one communication method.

Should ample funds remain they will be used to enhance distribution.
Should funds still remain we'll work on enhanced features. Such as playing customizable mp3s during phone calls to maximum resemblance to real phone calls.

What You GetHow this helps you:
If using our app you'll have plausible deniability because you'll have a huge number of unknown contacts and conversations.
Privacy through disinformation.  Your actual interests, contacts, etc will be mixed in with things your not interested in and people you don't know.
Unknown relationship map.  It'll be much more difficult for those surveilling you to establish relational maps of your contacts.

The assurance that your contributing towards the fundamental human right of privacy.

<b></b><p>SQUIZZ was created by Chris Oar. Aussie by birth, Chris has been a marketing and advertising consultant in the Bay Area for over 20 years.  When researching a digital signage systems for a client, he discovered they were all complicated and expensive!  You needed special hardware, custom installation and then you had to learn how to use software that was limited as to what content you could create. That's when he came up with the idea for SQUIZZ.  </p>
<p>Chris hired the development team at <a href=""http://www.getboundless.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GetBoundless,</a> to create the Squizz App.  It was designed to work on any Android device which means the need for expensive hardware and custom installation were eliminated. Next the team developed a cloud based content management software that could convert almost any type of video, image or document file for use as digital sign content.  </p>
<p>The first SQUIZZ prototype was put into service in late 2013.  SQUIZZ has been proven under daily use since then. <b>Right now we are developing an enhanced version of the system called SQUIZZ Pro and preparing for a large scale roll-out of both products.</b> There are so many ways to use SQUIZZ, in almost any business and even at home, we're sure you're going to want one!<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

</div></div>","What is SQUIZZ?

           

It's the easiest digital media display system ever invented!
(And we'll prove it...before you fund it!)  
After more than a year of daily use, in dozens of businesses, we've proven that SQUIZZ is the easiest digital signage system ever invented. That was our goal and now we have two new goals. Share it with the world and make it even better. With your help we can spread the word and continue to develop new features and capabilities. You're going to love how easy SQUIZZ is to use. In fact, we're going let you see how easy it is right here on Indiegogo..... before you fund it!

           THE SQUIZZ SYSTEM




The SQUIZZ system uses an Android stick loaded with the Squizz App. Slightly bigger than a flash drive, The Squizz Stick plugs into any TV with an HDMI port. Once connected to WI-FI, it's ready to display HD quality images, videos and documents immediately!  It's easy to install, light, portable and runs continuously!         
 SQUIZZ's Cloud-Based Content Manager is the key to it's simplicity. Accessible from any device, the drag-and-drop interface does everything. Upload any file and SQUIZZ makes it work. We want you to see how simple it really is. (See Below)

                     TAKE THE CONTENT MANAGER FOR A TEST DRIVE!
There are very few products, if any, on Indiegogo that provide the opportunity to try it before you fund it.  We are so confident you'll love the simplicity of Squizz, we're going to do give you that opportunity.

The Squizz Monitor / Timeline 





     


In the beginning...


SQUIZZ was created by Chris Oar. Aussie by birth, Chris has been a marketing and advertising consultant in the Bay Area for over 20 years.  When researching a digital signage systems for a client, he discovered they were all complicated and expensive!  You needed special hardware, custom installation and then you had to learn how to use software that was limited as to what content you could create. That's when he came up with the idea for SQUIZZ.  
Chris hired the development team at GetBoundless, to create the Squizz App.  It was designed to work on any Android device which means the need for expensive hardware and custom installation were eliminated. Next the team developed a cloud based content management software that could convert almost any type of video, image or document file for use as digital sign content.  
The first SQUIZZ prototype was put into service in late 2013.  SQUIZZ has been proven under daily use since then. Right now we are developing an enhanced version of the system called SQUIZZ Pro and preparing for a large scale roll-out of both products. There are so many ways to use SQUIZZ, in almost any business and even at home, we're sure you're going to want one! 


Who is using SQUIZZ? 






According to a report published in May 2015, the world-wide digital signage market is nearly $15 Billion, but it's expected to grow to almost $24 billion in just the next five years!  It's clear that delivering information through visual media display is going to play an important role in everyone's daily lives. 
                                                                       What role will Squizz play in the future of digital signage?
SQUIZZ turned to crowd-funding to grow because we believe the future for Squizz is to become an open source platform for developing digital signage concepts. 



Like so many great innovations before, opening the door for developers and designers to improve what we've started will make Squizz exponentially greater than it is today. That's why part of the funds from our Indiegogo campaign will go towards developing the Squizz Pro platform.   Squizz Pro will be designed so that third party contributions can be integrated as easily as downloading a new widget, graphic design template or video and dropping it in the content manager. 


YOUR FUNDING ON INDIEGOGO WILL HELP SQUIZZ DEVELOP THE SQUIZZ PRO PLATFORM AND BEGIN THAT FIRST STEP TOWARDS GREATER INNOVATION. 

                        What We Need From You


We are hoping to raise $250,000 to fund several objectives.What will the funds be use for?


Bulk buy of SQUIZZ Sticks from manufacturer. To date, we have only purchased the SQUIZZ Sticks or dongles in small quantities.

With your funding, we can make a large enough order to have the manufacturer use our specs, load the SQUIZZ app and do all labeling and packaging, driving down the costs and speeding up delivery. You can help make SQUIZZ even more affordable!


Development of SQUIZZ Pro. Squizz Pro will be the platform of the future, but it needs more development first. Your funding will help us develop coding that will accept feature widgets and plugins as easily as a mouse click.   ""SQUIZZIDGETS"" could be used to add useful content to a sign like date, time, weather, web content and more!  Other new features we are developing for Squizz Pro include setting Start & End times for timelines and re-directing timelines from one monitor to another. 


Marketing/Advertising. With your funding, we can grow our internet presence and open new marketing channels to bring offer SQUIZZ to more people.  


SQUIZZ Community Development: Finally, we need to grow our online SQUIZZ Community/Marketplace where users and developers can exchange ideas, sell content templates, download widgets and more.

<h2><strong><em>WATT, OTTO, DIESEL, WHITTEL …. THE CFRV ENGINE</em></strong></h2>
<h2><strong>OUR PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Dr. Roy Hartfield, professor of aerospace engineering at a major research university and the head of the CFRV Engine Project team. Our team is doing something that’s been described as <strong>“ridiculously ambitious”</strong>, yet many of the same people who first had that reaction have joined us because they believe these efforts are nothing short of an attempt to <strong>substantially improve the course of the world’s environmental and economic wellbeing.</strong> Believe me, you want us to succeed, and we need your help.</p>
<p>About ten years ago I had an idea for a greatly improved engine. Gas and diesel engines have, and will continue to suffer poor emissions and efficiency because of the <strong>wreckage left behind from intermittent combustion</strong> “explosions” in the pistons. Continuous combustion gas turbines, while highly efficient and clean (that’s why they produce over 20% of all electricity) can’t operate at slow speeds. They only perform well when running at near full throttle. This is why airline jets burn almost as much fuel taxiing to the runway as they do at altitude and full speed. Plus, they’re darned expensive to build.</p>
<p>There are many barriers to producing <strong>a truly efficient, useful internal combustion engine</strong>. Some of these are combustion control, emissions, wide operating range, fuel efficiency, mechanical efficiency, production costs, size, weight and longevity. Many people have tried many things. Our engine design over-comes most of the operational issues found in piston and gas turbine designs. Theoretically<strong>, the design promises an almost 50% increase</strong> in efficiency over gasoline piston designs and an even greater proportional decrease in emissions. All in a package that will be comparable in manufacturing cost to a piston or gas turbine engine of similar horse power. There are numerous other subtle advantages. Our design is called a continuous flow rotary vane (CFRV) design and while there are some earlier attempts at somewhat similar designs, this design incorporates entirely new concepts. The design has patents issued and pending.</p>

<p>See video for animation of engine operation.</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE DID THAT’S REALLY DIFFERENT. </strong></h3>
<p>The design is based on <strong>continuous, separate combustion in a positive displacement environment</strong>. This key innovation provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combustion control resulting in 99% complete combustion</li>
<li>No throttling needed for proper fuel/air mixture for intermittent (piston) combustion designs</li>
<li>Low emissions without after treatment due to longer and leaner combustion</li>
<li>Low mechanical losses and smooth operation due to the rotary vane compressor and expander</li>
<li>Flexible fuels, including low BTU fuels, just like gas turbines</li>
<li>Low cost manufacturing; no exotic shapes or materials</li>

OUR PROJECT
Hi, I’m Dr. Roy Hartfield, professor of aerospace engineering at a major research university and the head of the CFRV Engine Project team. Our team is doing something that’s been described as “ridiculously ambitious”, yet many of the same people who first had that reaction have joined us because they believe these efforts are nothing short of an attempt to substantially improve the course of the world’s environmental and economic wellbeing. Believe me, you want us to succeed, and we need your help.
About ten years ago I had an idea for a greatly improved engine. Gas and diesel engines have, and will continue to suffer poor emissions and efficiency because of the wreckage left behind from intermittent combustion “explosions” in the pistons. Continuous combustion gas turbines, while highly efficient and clean (that’s why they produce over 20% of all electricity) can’t operate at slow speeds. They only perform well when running at near full throttle. This is why airline jets burn almost as much fuel taxiing to the runway as they do at altitude and full speed. Plus, they’re darned expensive to build.
There are many barriers to producing a truly efficient, useful internal combustion engine. Some of these are combustion control, emissions, wide operating range, fuel efficiency, mechanical efficiency, production costs, size, weight and longevity. Many people have tried many things. Our engine design over-comes most of the operational issues found in piston and gas turbine designs. Theoretically, the design promises an almost 50% increase in efficiency over gasoline piston designs and an even greater proportional decrease in emissions. All in a package that will be comparable in manufacturing cost to a piston or gas turbine engine of similar horse power. There are numerous other subtle advantages. Our design is called a continuous flow rotary vane (CFRV) design and while there are some earlier attempts at somewhat similar designs, this design incorporates entirely new concepts. The design has patents issued and pending.

See video for animation of engine operation.
WHAT WE DID THAT’S REALLY DIFFERENT. 
The design is based on continuous, separate combustion in a positive displacement environment. This key innovation provides:

Combustion control resulting in 99% complete combustion
No throttling needed for proper fuel/air mixture for intermittent (piston) combustion designs
Low emissions without after treatment due to longer and leaner combustion
Low mechanical losses and smooth operation due to the rotary vane compressor and expander
Flexible fuels, including low BTU fuels, just like gas turbines
Low cost manufacturing; no exotic shapes or materials

FAQs
Explain how the engine solves the piston and turbine engine issues.
Will it have expensive component issues like a gas turbine?
Will this fit in a car?
How do you lubricate the engine?
What are those tubes in the engine?
What are the specifications of the prototype engine shown?
What's the thermodynamic cycle?
 
After five years of design refinement, I personally funded the patents and manufacture of a test bed prototype beginning in 2008. A working prototype was built by 2010 and it proved many of the design concepts, but the seals for the engine were not manufactured with the precision needed.

That’s why we’re here on IndieGoGo.
WHAT WE’RE GOING TO DO WITH YOUR HELP. 
The ultimate goal of the IndieGoGo project is to operate the test bed prototype engine on natural gas at a load sufficient to determine final efficiency. After that we realize we’ll need serious, multimillion-dollar efforts to see this through to commercialization. But one step at a time.

The project will entail rebuilding the three sets of seals using new manufacturing techniques and materials, refinishing the compression and expansion chamber and test firing the combustor to full design power. All seals will be statically and dynamically tested prior to engine final assembly.All supporters will be invited to join a private web cast of the testing.

<p>More
often than not the things we do are just <i>random</i>
thoughts that God has laid on one of our hearts. It is fun to pretend that we
are in God’s boardroom strategizing on new ways to show people, God’s love. We
have learned over the years that we can try anything once. We never have much

<p>We have
always been blessed with enough. In all honestly God makes me laugh at how he
puts things in place for us, how he shows up to help us complete the task.
There is nothing special about any of us at the ARK except that we <b>believe</b>, we have imagination &amp;

<h1><b>Why we need you!</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The ARK needs funding to continue our evangelism and acts of random kindness.  Since we are a small but growing Church, we don't have an abundance of funds for our outreach. We believe that these ark's are the Holy Spirit working through our members to bring others closer to Christ.  We recently decided to build the Garden of ARK so to help beautify our place of worship. Since the creation of our Garden, we've realized that our acts of kindness are not limited to our community.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But first, why build a garden? </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Because, the
grass by our parking lot couldn’t look any less like a field.  And because, one Sunday, in a Church meeting
it was laid on our hearts to plant some flowers.  And really how hard can it be to start a
garden? (Harder than you think, did I say it was a field?) This project will
take us several years to get to the point where people say what a beautiful
garden. Right now we are at the stage where people say what is the ARK up to
now? But those who know us shake their heads &amp; say “just you wait… “</span></p>
<p><br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<p>Before the
first flower was ever planted we got an “outdoor chapel” for our garden. Ok, so
it is the bus stop from Riv-r-land (a neighborhood in our community.) But the roof doesn’t leak &amp; it is a
great place to sit &amp; pray. Our “chapel” also, blocks the flashing “Casino,
Liquor” sign on the back of the gas station that faces our church. </p>
<p></p>
<p>So now we
have an open door chapel, how cool is that? We are located on Exit 2 of South
Dakota on I-29, with our location so close to the interstate we don’t keep our
building unlocked. So the open door chapel will be a welcome place for praying
&amp; seeking sanctuary from the elements. “Seeking sanctuary” seems dramatic
doesn’t it? Since this spring we know of several couples who have been
traveling &amp; they did in fact seek sanctuary in our little chapel.</p>
<p>God knows
the needs of his people, God knows how to align ideas, God fulfill the needs of
those who love him. So God was with us in the flood, God was with us in the
recovery, God set in the hearts of the kids of Riv-r-land, that they didn’t
need a bus stop, God gave the idea to use it was a “chapel”, God found a way to
move it, God set it in a place that when his people who had little, were
traveling by foot, they could be kept dry by a roof that was put in the right
place at the right time for this children to sleep in.</p>
<p>And now you
can help us grow our garden, share the warmth of a blanket, know that when the
sun sets in the west that you have helped to keep one of God’s people dry &amp;
warm. That as they lay on the wooden bench looking out the window as the
sunsets that tonight they found sanctuary, at exit 2 in South Dakota. </p>

It's a common belief that there are actually 5 apostles: Matthew, Mark, Luke & John…the 5th is
you.
Many people

Christian then it is our job to tell the world about their words. My favorite

Take notice
of the blessings, & the details God has set before you. Add them to the
sermon of your life & share them with those who may not know, Matthew,
Mark, Luke & John.
Through the
words of our mouth & the meditations of our heart, we can be the 5th
apostle to those we find in our lives…We are just all part of God’s details.

If so, then VisualSaaS is for you!</span></p><br/>VisualSaaS is a service that allows structured applications to be built and run entirely in the Cloud.<br/><br/>VisualSaaS offers a full, visual development environment where developers can build any application based on structured, tabular data, all through a simple point-and-click designer. Collaboration is built in to VisualSaaS, from code control and sharing, through interactive design tools, to immediate availability for end users. It is particularly suited to Agile development. VisualSaaS comes with a hosted, industrial strength PostgreSQL database by default, but through the use of connectors it can be tightly integrated with existing relational database systems.<br/><br/>VisualSaaS is ideal for organisations that want to build and modify applications quickly and reliably - organisations that want to be able to respond rapidly to operating conditions. VisualSaaS offers a range of productivity tools. Template applications can be adapted using these tools and further enhanced with readily-available skills. User training is kept to an absolute minimum.  <br/><br/><h3>What Problem does VisualSaaS Solve?</h3>Many organisations have spreadsheets and databases holding information that is vital to the efficient running of their operations. This information is often held in multiple applications on multiple servers in the office. Users often do not know which version of the information they have. Handling changes to the data is also difficult if extracts or copies of the data have to be sent to users by email, as someone has to merge any changes back into the main source of data.<br/><br/>VisualSaaS solves these problems by providing a set of tools to enable any authorised user to build and enhance applications quickly and easily, while allowing data from the existing spreadsheets and databases to be imported. The data is then immediately available wherever, whenever and however you want. Applications developed by VisualSaaS are easy for users to understand and engage with, and allow organisations to reap the numerous benefits of running services in the Cloud.<br/><br/>VisualSaaS is immediately different from every other web-based business system. It provides a Windows-style interface delivered through a browser allowing users to work the way they want, not the way the system dictates. While the vast majority of web sites display information one page at a time, VisualSaaS allows one or more forms to be displayed simultaneously and dragged around the screen to fit the user's needs – just what users are familiar with on their desktop PC or Mac.<br/><br/><h3>What will the Funds be Used For?<br/>
</h3>We want to raise £45,000 so that we can concentrate on making this a well-rounded product that people can easily use. To do this we need to:<br/><ul>
<li>clear up known issues</li>
<li>complete the documentation for developers, covering help pages, videos, and worked examples</li>
<li>provide more attributes to control UI widgets</li>
<li>support more external database types</li>
<li>implement better separation of applications and re-use of components in libraries</li>
<li>provide a graphical CSS editor for easier styling of applications</li>
<li>build an API so that scripts and programs running remotely can access data within VisualSaaS</li>
<li>link to external file stores, such an Box, OneDrive, and DropBox</li>
<li>and we can always add more widgets and add more flexibility to widgets</li>
</ul>Our plan is to make the service available for public use by 1st October 2014, once the known issues have been cleared up and the documentation has been put in place. After this, we will continue working on the other features while supporting active users of the service.<br/><br/>If we don't get all the funds we are looking for, we will still concentrate on clearing up the known issues and putting the documentation in place, while aiming for a public launch as soon as possible.<br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We have been building systems for people for over 50 years between us, so we have in-depth knowledge about what features VisualSaaS must offer to make it useful to developers. However, neither of us are into (or understand) marketing so getting the message out to the world is something we need help with (see Other Ways You Can Help). Our plan is to use a portion of the service fees, which will come in when VisualSaaS is released to the public, for advertising and marketing.<br/><br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you want to help, but aren't able to contribute, we are looking for volunteers:<br/><ul>
<li>to help with the PR and marketing of VisualSaaS so that we build up our web presence,</li>
<li>with a good eye for design who can help create a set of CSS templates for VisualSaaS so that we can look good as well be good, and </li>

As anyone who has built this type of application is aware, there is a lot of repetition in what is done.<br/><br/>Over the last 15 years we have worked pre-dominantly on web-based applications that have been used to share data amongst workforces that are both geographically dispersed and not employed by a single company.  And we have found that while there are many tools for building amazing looking web sites with all manner of fancy UI controls, when it comes to linking these to a back-end database or two, you are pretty much left to get on with it by yourself.<br/><br/>So we decided to build our own graphical toolkit with integrated UI controls to allow us to build sophisticated web applications that are, most importantly, tightly linked to a fully functional relational database. And it was built in the Cloud so we could jointly build systems and rapidly roll out changes to our customers.

<p>Interest about RovAir is growing. Come join the revolution! </p>
<h2>Why is this campaign important?  ""4 in 5""</h2>
<p>Many resources are not scarce.  However, they can be unattainable.  Mobile broadband is certainly a good example.  We often take for granted just how empowering reliable connectivity can be to our lives; how it can enrich many aspects of our lives.  We also assume that access is everywhere. The fact is, over 119 million persons in the US alone do not have broadband access, 1 in 3 persons.  The world numbers are even more disparate as an astounding <strong>4 in 5</strong> persons do not have reliable access. </p>
<p>There are many reasons why broadband access may be difficult to obtain.  It could be unaffordable or there may be a lack of infrastructure, but in all cases a lack of access puts persons at a competitive, educational, social and market disadvantage.<br/> <br/> We at RovAir thought about what could happen if we could SHARE broadband resources and make them more attainable for all.  The ability to introduce mobile broadband into the Sharing Economy, by allowing those with access to share with others, can bring affordable access to many more persons.  By sharing costs and benefits in a collaborative way, all parties involved can benefit greatly; from the individual to the business to the network carrier.  The opportunity in developing nations is even more staggering.  It is hugely important issue, with a potentially huge impact for millions of people.  RovAir is pioneering mobile broadband into the Sharing Economy.</p>
<h2>What does RovAir do?</h2>
<p>We provide on demand mobile broadband access. Anywhere you can get a cellular signal you can get online, anytime you want.  We call it RovAir OnDemand. </p>
<h2>How does RovAir do it?</h2>
<p>We can turn on mobile broadband devices only when you need it and for any time period.  Then we turn it off when you are finished. We use a <span>Collaborative Consumption platform that lets us share our lines, or other companies', with you, when you want it.</span><strong><br/></strong></p>

<h2>What is a mobile broadband device?</h2>
<p>It is a USB stick or personal wifi hotspot which allows you to connect a laptop, tablet or smartphone to the internet over a wireless data network.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where would I use a device like this?</h2>
<p>Just about anywhere - for your business trip, a weekend getaway, at a tradeshow, at the airport, even the beach.  Anywhere you need quick and convenient access to the internet.  No need to go searching for WiFi.  It can now be in your pocket.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<h2>When would I use a device like this?</h2>
<p>Anytime you require the internet way from your home or office.  The completion of the web-based interface will allow you to connect from any location at anytime.  No need to go searching for WiFi.  It can now be in your pocket, ready to use whenever you need it.</p>
<h2>What does it cost?</h2>
<p>Because we use 100% refurbished devices, we are good for your pocketbook and the environment.  We can usually provide devices for under $50.  You can also rent them.  Or, you can search for a compatible device in a number of online outlets.  The RovAir OnDemand service costs just a few dollars per day, but you connect only when you want and pay for only when you use it.</p>
<h2>What is the project?</h2>
<p>We are seeking to complete a web-based platform which will allow us to provide automatic activations and also provide connections down to the hour or even for just minutes at a time.  It is an interface for you. . . to schedule activations, add time and share with others. </p>
<p>We also want to procure more compatible equipment and get it in your hands so you can use the service whenever you like.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<h2>Why is RovAir different?</h2>
<p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/57099840?autoplay=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Vimeo: Rovair &amp; Tech Goes Home""><img alt=""Rovair - Tech Goes Home"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://beta.rovair.com/media/Rovair-TGH.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 20px;"" title=""Rovair - Tech Goes Home""/></a></p>
<p>We do it through a very cool platform called Collaborative Consumption, part of the emerging Sharing Economy.  Time Magazine called it one of the “<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059521_2059717_2059710,00.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ten Ideas That Will Change the World</a></span>” It allows us to identify unused broadband resources, lines and data, and SHARE it with you, your company, or a program in need.  In fact, we are working with one program in need right now, Tech Goes Home.  Take a look...<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is so cool about Collaborative Consumption?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href=""https://vimeo.com/57099098?autoplay=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Vimeo: Rovair - Collaborative Consumption""><img alt=""Rovair - Collaborative Consumption"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://beta.rovair.com/media/Rovair-CollaborativeConsumption.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 20px;"" title=""Rovair - Collaborative Consumption""/></a></strong></p>
<p>Collaborative Consumption re-imagines how we can access things by sharing them.  It says if we can identify and re-allocate unused resources, we can allow many more people access to these resources, sharing both the cost and the benefit.  RovAir identifies broadband resources, lines and data, and shares it with you.  It’s all part of the new Sharing Economy.  A lot of great companies use the same methodology, Airbnb, ZipCar, TaskRabbit, RelayRides.  See the video. . .</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What else can you do to help?</h2>
<p>We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can forward this link to your network via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet.</p>
<p>We thank you so much for your support.  Only together can we bring mobile broadband and all of the benefits of living, working and interacting in a connected society to many, many more people.</p>

We also want to procure more compatible equipment and get it in your hands so you can use the service whenever you like. 
Why is RovAir different?

We do it through a very cool platform called Collaborative Consumption, part of the emerging Sharing Economy.  Time Magazine called it one of the “Ten Ideas That Will Change the World” It allows us to identify unused broadband resources, lines and data, and SHARE it with you, your company, or a program in need.  In fact, we are working with one program in need right now, Tech Goes Home.  Take a look...
 
What is so cool about Collaborative Consumption?

Collaborative Consumption re-imagines how we can access things by sharing them.  It says if we can identify and re-allocate unused resources, we can allow many more people access to these resources, sharing both the cost and the benefit.  RovAir identifies broadband resources, lines and data, and shares it with you.  It’s all part of the new Sharing Economy.  A lot of great companies use the same methodology, Airbnb, ZipCar, TaskRabbit, RelayRides.  See the video. . .
 
What else can you do to help?
We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can forward this link to your network via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet.
We thank you so much for your support.  Only together can we bring mobile broadband and all of the benefits of living, working and interacting in a connected society to many, many more people.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>When we discovered that other UMPCs in the market still have some drawbacks  it inspired us to develop MiniBook to optimize the customer experience.<br/><br/>From the outset, we collected user evaluation and product data for UMPC devices from different channels. We crunched the numbers and concluded that the core reasons that UMPC owners switched to other devices are dissatisfaction with small screens, memory capacity, appearance,  keyboard and camera.<br/><br/>Since then, our team has devoted itself to creating the best MiniBook possible</p><h3><strong>1. Screen</strong></h3><p>Our experience of the PC industry has taught us that the Windows operating system works far better with an 8-inch and 16:10 screen ratio. How do we know? Our Chuwi Hi8 SE is the most popular Windows tablet, selling more than one million units worldwide.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560938390/sqtzztgtdgwqgv6wxef3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>
<br/><strong>2. SSD expansion slot</strong>
</h3><p>For the first time, our engineers have found a way to fit an M.2 SSD card slot into Minibook, so users can expand their storage.

Plus, if that’s not enough, there’s room for an microSD card to expand even further.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561345930/xjs0b3v9j8dskzlv66lr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>3.

MiniBook is an ultra-tiny laptop (or UMPC)  which measures just 1/4 the size of a traditional notebook - even with its fully integrated keyboard.  The unique 360° flipping YOGA design allows MiniBook to be transformed into laptop, workstation or tablet with a simple twist.Minibook is all about optimal performance. The Intel Core m3-8100Y processor, 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 128GB storage enable you to finish business work, game playing, movie watching and run almost any program as you like. It’s like three machines in one, at a bargain price.

Study
When we discovered that other UMPCs in the market still have some drawbacks  it inspired us to develop MiniBook to optimize the customer experience.From the outset, we collected user evaluation and product data for UMPC devices from different channels. We crunched the numbers and concluded that the core reasons that UMPC owners switched to other devices are dissatisfaction with small screens, memory capacity, appearance,  keyboard and camera.Since then, our team has devoted itself to creating the best MiniBook possible1. ScreenOur experience of the PC industry has taught us that the Windows operating system works far better with an 8-inch and 16:10 screen ratio. How do we know? Our Chuwi Hi8 SE is the most popular Windows tablet, selling more than one million units worldwide.
2. SSD expansion slot
For the first time, our engineers have found a way to fit an M.2 SSD card slot into Minibook, so users can expand their storage. Minibook is the world's first UMPC with expandable storage like this. Plus, if that’s not enough, there’s room for an microSD card to expand even further. 3. Unique YOGA 360° rotating designFeedback from our community tells us that versatility is a big plus for users, so we subverted the traditional UMPC design concept on the MiniBook. The unique 360° flipping bracket can be switched to multiple scene modes such as tablet, notebook and workstation.4. KeyboardThe Minibook will be available in two keyboard layouts - Japanese and US English for maximum productivity.Our brand new keyboard layout fits a full-sized, full-spaced layout in the smallest of form factors. 5. CameraThe UMPC format is ideal for business people to conduct video conferences from anywhere - but only if there is a built-in camera. Most UMPC brands said ‘no’, ignoring user needs. But where they say ‘no’, we say ‘YES!’, so, we decided to add a built-in camera, to let the user connect to the world in the palm of the hand. 
​Appearance  

MiniBook comes in ‘Business Space Grey’ with a unique exterior refinishing technology
Precision CNC cutting craft provides a far better feel in the hand
MiniBook was built as portable as cellphone, with the convenience of single hand operation. 
Slip it into your pocket, take it to work or play anywhere you choose. 
The 8-inch yoga 360° flipping UMPC will bridge the divide between laptop and tablet, you can be sure of that.. It can be switched into diverse modes such as laptop, tablet, or gaming station. With our creative flipping function, every angle degree is under your control. This allows you to work in restricted spaces comfortably, on planes, on trains, in coffee bars. You can also hold the MiniBook and use it with ease standing up or on the bus.
Screen
A 9-inch screen would ruin the portability, but a 7-inch screen struggles with text-heavy applications like Excel. That’s why we’ve chosen  the perfect 8-inch and 16:10 screen ratios devices for Minibook. Small size screens don’t always display standard fonts or will blur images, so we developed our professional display optimization system to bring a vivid photo and clear font.But it’s not just size that matters.

As experienced developers of professional 3D printers, we want to redefine personal 3D printing with Migo.
We thought about 3D printers on the market and asked: How can 3D printers make life simpler and easier? What if they were portable to use when maintaining simplicity, and yet still have a good deal of versatility and connectivity? They could bring your creations to life!
Introducing Migo, the ideal printer!

We started last month with Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter with only English UI; but it's almost updated every 1-2 weeks with more networks and languages. The current version supports sharing to multiple accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Twitter, VKontakte, Xing and Yammer with support for 10 UI languages (Arabic, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Hindi); and this is just a start. Additionally we are working to make it available to almost everyone as soon as possible through the <a href=""http://sharit.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web version</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730111/files/20140719234905-1.png?1405838945"" src="""" style=""width: 300px; height: 470px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730112/files/20140719234920-2.png?1405838960"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 300px; height: 470px; background-color: initial;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730108/files/20140719234800-3.png?1405838880"" src="""" style=""width: 300px; height: 470px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/730113/files/20140719235130-4.png?1405839090"" src="""" style=""width: 300px; height: 470px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><i style=""color: #666666;""><div style=""text-align: center;""><i style=""color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"">screenshots from <a href=""http://i6a.es/sharit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sharit 1.4</a> for WP8</i></div></i><p></p><ul></ul><div>

<p>Meanwhile we can breakdown our plan for the first 6-9 months to the following items</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance the Windows Phone app.</li>
<li>Launch the Web version with mobile version optimized for iOS and Android.</li>
<li>Launch the Windows app.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Launch the native iPhone/iPad app.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Launch the native Android app.</li>

</h3>
</div><div> <p> There are a number of important point that might impact the progress or achievement of our goals.</p> <ul>
<li>
<b>The team size and experience</b> : this is by far the utmost challenge but with your support we could add the best members to the team. We already have an initial list but only waiting for the proper fund.</li> <li>
<b>The networks to integrate</b>: some networks are a must-have like Facebook and Twitter but there is a huge number of could-have and nice-to-have options that you would again play an important role in defining these priorities.</li>
<li>
<b>The features to add</b>: there is no limit to what you can do by mixing all this social power together and Although we have many features in mind, we would always be open to new ideas and suggestions that would enrich your experience in every way possible.</li>

</div> <p><br/></p><p>Thanks.</p></div>","Overview...Our goal is to create the best social/business/productivity tool available on all platforms; to integrate all data from your accounts and make it much more useful and easier to consume, search and relate.The problem!Nowadays we -the internet generations- are heavily dependent on online communities, platforms and tools. There are hundreds and thousands of networks and platforms available and the average user has 6-10 accounts and others may have 50+ accounts. We think this is really annoying for many reasons including -but not limited- to the following list ..
Too many networks means too many credentials to track and update all the time.
Too many networks means too many updates, context switch and apps/tools to keep track of what happens.
Almost each platform acts as an isolated island, the information is redundant, inconsistent and hard to track and relate.
Having many friends with different tastes and preferences would force you to create more and more accounts to stay on touch with all of them.


Project Overview...

We aim to build a cross-platform application on top of existing social networks and platforms. To provide one flexible interface that combines all their individual strengths, discover new and innovative ways to enrich this experience for individuals and businesses.
Just imagine what you can do by connecting all the social power of Facebook, Twitter, Sina Weibo and VK with the business power of LinkedIn, Xing and Yammer; added to the productivity of Pocket, Reddit, Stumble, and Pinterest; mixed with the advantages of Viber, Foursquare, Tumblr and Pinterest; combining all the space available on your PC, Phone, Tablet, One Drive and Box. Imagine all of this work as one platform, managed from one interface, communicating and feeding information to one another at real time.The initial features and services we have in mind are listed below

Unified Social Feeds: a single interface for all social accounts with unique, customizable views across all devices.

Multi Sharing: sharing updates, photos, videos, location info or anything else to all you accounts, pages, groups at once.

Unified Messaging: a new secure messaging service for private communication,


Social Add-ins: a set of new features that can enhance the overall user experience for the existing social networks and platform (adding Dislike to Facebook for example).


Universal Search: visual search using all information available in all your social accounts and devices with info-graphics, statistics and data visualization.


Talent Management: an innovative service to cover the recruitment process from applying and screening to training and performance appraisals.
and this is just the beginning and we continue to add more and more in the future. We are open for any suggestions.

Planned Platform Support!
The initial goal is to release a native application for each of the following platforms at the first 6-9 months.

Android
iPad
iPhone
Web Application
Windows 8
Windows Phone 8
In the future, we may consider other platforms like Mac, Chrome OS and other devices like XBox, Play Station and Smart TVs.The First Steps!It's a long road ahead but we already took our first step by launching Sharit for Windows Phone to enable multi-sharing across multiple social accounts and networks. We started last month with Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter with only English UI; but it's almost updated every 1-2 weeks with more networks and languages. The current version supports sharing to multiple accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Twitter, VKontakte, Xing and Yammer with support for 10 UI languages (Arabic, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Hindi); and this is just a start. Additionally we are working to make it available to almost everyone as soon as possible through the web version.screenshots from sharit 1.4 for WP8
What is Next...
 The final goal is very wide and to achieve it in the specified time, we would need much more resources and team members than we have now. We need to expand the team to include more developers, designers, testers and others to accelerate our progress even more.
Meanwhile we can breakdown our plan for the first 6-9 months to the following items


Enhance the Windows Phone app.
Launch the Web version with mobile version optimized for iOS and Android.
Launch the Windows app.

Launch the native iPhone/iPad app.

Launch the native Android app.

The order above is based on the current state and availability and it might change with new members being added to the team to speed up various platforms.



  
Risks & Challenges!

  There are a number of important point that might impact the progress or achievement of our goals. 

The team size and experience : this is by far the utmost challenge but with your support we could add the best members to the team. We already have an initial list but only waiting for the proper fund. 
The networks to integrate: some networks are a must-have like Facebook and Twitter but there is a huge number of could-have and nice-to-have options that you would again play an important role in defining these priorities.

The features to add: there is no limit to what you can do by mixing all this social power together and Although we have many features in mind, we would always be open to new ideas and suggestions that would enrich your experience in every way possible.

APIs limits: There is a vast number of networks, each with their own APIs and most of APIs have limits in features or usage rates. This might affect our initial plans but with your increased support, we would be able to arrange future deals and provide the best possible experience. 
  

What if the goal is not met!..
It's an important question indeed; so let me explain it a little bit.
I should make it clear that Sharit is already under development and it would continue even if the goal is not met but -of course- in a slower pace. The 250K is estimated to accomplish the whole project vision with all features for all platforms and devices in a maximum of 10-12 months.

If the goal is not met, we would continue the development in the same order mentioned in the ""What is Next"" section above and in the worst case, the app will be available as a Web Application and in Windows 8 during the next 3 months. The perks will be granted as coupons that you can redeem anytime when Sharit is available in your platform and you are ready to start the premium membership.

<h3>Brief summary</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Who are we ? </strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>​</strong>At OutNest, we come from different backgrounds, but we all have one big common trait: we are all students or former ones! From HEC Lausanne to CREA Genève, going through EPFL. Our team is composed of different profiles, with various competencies and experiences that complete each other. </p>
<ul><li><strong>What is OutNest and how did we get the idea ?</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">ON is a mobile app based on two main aspects (information / social) and four sections (academic information + practical information / meetings + recommandations). We designed each section to respond to existing student needs.  We observed most of these needs thanks to a survey sent to hundreds of students on different campuses in the Lausanne area. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Formerly designed to help travelers inspire each others, our concept changed course during the UNIL-HEC Accelerator in 2016. This program, created by the Fondation HEC and supported by the Université de Lausanne, allowed us to see that we needed to change our former idea if we wanted to create something sustainable. It helped us to move on then and focus on a target not too far from travelers: international/exchange students! Driven by their will to study abroad, to discover other cultures and to meet other people, they are travelers too. Besides, we knew a lot of students who left their hometown to explore the world through their studies, and some of us did the same.  Now that we identified the different issues, and after having observed student needs, we decided to find a way to enhance their overall experience abroad. </p>
<ul><li><strong>In what way is OutNest bringing something new into the student life ? </strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our observations allowed us to see what were the major issues for students away from home. It appeared that they often feel lost, or taking way too much time to find the information that they need. Between the tedious administratives procedures, the beginning of the courses, the time to adapt to a brand new surrounding, and so on... Students have a lot to think about. Thus, the best way to help them is to centralize this information, in order to settle quickly and to enjoy their new home as soon as they possibly can! </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To do so, OutNest proposes a mobile app, free and intuitive, that is structured this way: </p>
<ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Information part :  <ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<i>About the University : </i>in this section, the university/school is able to communicate directly to its students through many options (push notifications, news wall, interactive maps, instead of never-checked emails or huge websites...), for the payment of a yearly license. The university can see what kind of information or subsections to be posted. It can be flexible. OutNest will also provide it with monthly stats reports on students' behavior and needs on the app, in order to improve its services. </li></ul>

The highly mirrored finish of the logo perfectly sets the tone for this piece and the added technology of a bespoke magnetic charging cable (also anodised to match the base) gives you the discretion you need.

<li>We use Golden Calcite that is mined in Mexico. We choose only those mines that are sympathetic to the environment and where the material is in plentiful supply.</li>
<li>Each raw gemstone is then washed to prepare for the next stage of processing.</li>
<li>We use high quality diamond edge saws to cut each gemstone into smaller cubes according to the small, medium and large sizes that we offer.</li>
<li>Our craftsmen now shape each cube, by hand, into a sphere using a diamond grit grinding wheel. The shape is achieved by eye and takes the work of a true experienced and dedicated craftsman.</li>
<li>The spheres now go through our grading and measuring process and any that are not perfect are rejected.</li>
<li>A final grinding is used to achieve a final perfect shape, before each stone is polished on a buffing wheel. The individual shine and glow of each stone is now revealed.</li>
<li>We now prepare the bases using a Tungsten tipped cutting tool. We send these for anodising to achieve the Deep Space Grey colour.</li>

It represents life and brings joy into our day. We have recreated this life force with our Sun Mood Lamp. Created using Golden Calcite - prized for its mesmerising texture and clarity - to allow the light to spread within the sphere and to radiate into the room. We create each piece individually, ensuring yours is as unique as you are. We handcraft each set and polish it to perfection. Bring the sun into your home and capture a small part of that power.  A perfect gift for a friend or loved oneThe DeskSpace Sun Mood Lamp is both beautiful and stylish and makes the most wonderful timeless gift that can last a lifetime. The soft glow is ideal for bedrooms, to create an ambient environment in a lounge or a perfect desktop accompaniment to enhance any workspace. Most of us have looked to the sky and marvelled at the natural force that brings us warmth and light - imagine having that offered as a gift? Stylish and sophisticated accessory for the home and officeThe soft and warm light that emanates from our Solar Mood Lamp is ideal for any room or workspace. Without overpowering the senses, this light is visually striking and will create a gentle glow in any room. Perfect as a subtle night light for the bedside table or to capture the beauty of your desk accessories or a row of books on your shelf. It is more than just light - this is a room-enhancing glow that gives a sense of relaxation and peace.   Beautiful and Touchably Smooth - A Long Journey to the Right MaterialHow to capture the beauty and brightness of the Sun? We worked tirelessly to source the exact material that would showcase the unique way that the sun emits light. The material needed to be able to both encase the light and emit it gently and evenly. Our worldwide search resulted in Golden Calcite - a unique crystalline structure with a translucent appearance that has a softness and warmth that we could not find in any other material. When the light is not turned on, this globe is a stunning accessory for your room. However, switch on the light and the gemstone comes to life creating a focal point that will draw the eye and relax the soul. With a smooth surface that simply calls out to be touched, this is a creative gift that will win the hearts of all. DeskSpace: Contemporary - Modern Style for the Modern HomeThe Solar Lamp is the first product in our new contemporary range creating a more modern feel using metal instead of hardwood. The new contemporary range combined with our classic range means DeskSpace can fit perfectly into any style of home or working environment. We started to make this distinction with the base, which uses aerospace grade aluminium that has been anodised to a Deep Space Grey. The highly mirrored finish of the logo perfectly sets the tone for this piece and the added technology of a bespoke magnetic charging cable (also anodised to match the base) gives you the discretion you need. We never want to detract from the gemstone and therefore discrete technology that is as beautiful and minimalist as the piece itself is important to us. We know it is important to you, as well. A DeskSpace Mood Lamp to Meet All Your NeedsWe believe that our products should fit with your lifestyle and be individualised to your requirements. We offer the Solar Mood Lamp in three different sizes to suit any space and each can have the LED lighting adjusted to fit your mood. The illumination can range from a soft mood light to a brighter focal point - but always the Golden Calcite ensures the light is diffused and softened.Large 8cm +/- 0.5cm | Medium 6cm +/- 0.5cm | Small 4cm +/- 0.5cm  Size Comparison between Solar Sun Mood Lamp (S) and Planetary SystemSize Comparison between Solar Sun Mood Lamp (M) and Planetary SystemSize Comparison between Solar Sun Mood Lamp (L) and Planetary System                Build Your Knowledge of the UniverseHere at DeskSpace, we love to offer a little extra. When you buy your Solar Mood Lamp, we also give you a high quality, heavyweight booklet full of interesting and sometimes, intriguing facts about the Sun. Filled with detailed images, this book is the perfect addition to the light. Our base design allows for the book to nestle inside, so you always know where to find it. If you have someone in your life who loves space, this is the perfect combination gift. From Our Minds and Into Your HomeThe Sun was not created overnight and neither is our DesSpace Solar Mood Lamp - in fact we spend a very long time perfecting the shape and the glow so that you can delight in the quality. Our craftspeople hand shape every piece of gemstone into a perfect sphere before carefully polishing it to a glass-like shimmer. This takes time, but getting it right is not worth rushing. 
We use Golden Calcite that is mined in Mexico. We choose only those mines that are sympathetic to the environment and where the material is in plentiful supply.
Each raw gemstone is then washed to prepare for the next stage of processing.
We use high quality diamond edge saws to cut each gemstone into smaller cubes according to the small, medium and large sizes that we offer.
Our craftsmen now shape each cube, by hand, into a sphere using a diamond grit grinding wheel. The shape is achieved by eye and takes the work of a true experienced and dedicated craftsman.
The spheres now go through our grading and measuring process and any that are not perfect are rejected.
A final grinding is used to achieve a final perfect shape, before each stone is polished on a buffing wheel. The individual shine and glow of each stone is now revealed.
We now prepare the bases using a Tungsten tipped cutting tool. We send these for anodising to achieve the Deep Space Grey colour.
Using a special process of polishing, masking and sandblasting we are able to achieve a highly mirrored DeskSpace logo against a modern matte grey finish. 
A Gift That You’ll be Proud to Give We know that the unboxing of any gift is part of the experience and we have designed our presentation box with the unwrapping in mind. We use only the highest quality rigid gift box and we protect every element with layers of EVA foam. The bespoke magnetic cable, information booklet, cleaning cloth and letter of authenticity (including a unique serial number) set off the gift perfectly - allowing the receiver to uncover more and more layers of excitement as they delve deeper.

to help busy parents develop their children into lifelong learners, while also
giving back to those less fortunate.</p>
<p>I have three young nephews and
every time I buy them a gift, I want it to have some sort of educational
component.I never
really thought about it being a part of my job, it was just the kind of aunt,
and eventually parent, that I wanted to be.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years. I was
interning for a tech company and partnered with toy companies to develop a new children’s
product. It was such a rewarding experience and I realized that working in the
children’s industry was my calling.  Then,
when I looked around, I witnessed stressed friends and relatives struggling to
juggle work, life, plus a newborn and trying to learn everything about raising
a child. Often it was just easier for them to grab any toy off a shelf than to
think about what was developmentally best for their child – it was totally
overwhelming. I wanted to help ease the burden on new parents and facilitate
hassle-free learning for their kids. And so the idea for Austin Lloyd™ was
born. </p>
<p>I’ve also always been raised to
know that there were people in this world less fortunate than me. So, I wanted
to provide customers with an opportunity to donate toys to help those who need
it.</p>
<p>I found a way to bring all of
this passion together: to help busy parents select toys that develop their
child's fine motor and cognitive skills, deliver those toys right to their door
every month, and give back to others!<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                 </span></p><p></p><p></p><p>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322233/files/20140121145627-Jess_ball_smile.JPG?1390344987"" src="""" style=""width: 310.5px; height: 207px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why I Need Funding</h3><p></p><p>Austin Lloyd™ is still a newborn.

<p>From the most ancient times, we’ve been attracted by items made with soul, sense and idea. People put a lot of effort into design and technological advances of cars, mechanisms, planes and steam engines. Even after lots of time these items still captivate our minds just like the mechanical automatons of the past and figures by such wizards as Peter Carl Fabergé. Their inventions are presented in museums and exhibited in private collections.</p>
<p>In the modern world, due to modern technologies there is a possibility to become a wizard by yourself and you personally can create something as attractive and innovative.</p>
<p>That’s why we have set the goal to create the most beautiful construction set in the world. The set ,which you can easily assemble into a mechanical piece of art. Time for machine is the first exclusive construction set worth your attention.</p>
<p>We have already had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2017. It was our first step, when we showed our first four models and fulfilled our obligations. Since that time we have fine-tuned our product, removed all shortcomings, reached better results in designing and assembling the models.</p>

<p>Time For Machine is a new perspective in the world of construction sets - unique models made of metal, which you can personally assemble.</p>
<p>Each model has a detailed instruction in several languages. However, the assembling process will be much easier if you watch our video instructions. These video lessons will help you with mechanics and STEM 101.<br/>Inside the package you’ll see the special black envelope divided into sections. Special plates with metal parts will be inside. They're produced by chemical etching method and have smoothed and safe edges. Due to the special connections all parts can be easily separated from the plate. Parts can be easily bent by hands. In special the bottom compartments there are gears made of thick metal and a block with spring . Some models have special plywood moulds which can help to adjust the form of some elements of the model.</p>
<p>Each model can be assembled by using only tiny pliers. Parts are connected with each other with the easy twist of eyering. We also offer a set of professional assembling tools, which include 2 different types of pliers, 2 files and polishing cloth.</p>

<p>All our models are mechanical and have their own story. Movement of a gear wheel is movement of life. Covered in bright armor this mechanism will become a real centerpiece of your interior and a useful gift to a friend.</p>
<ul>
<li>The rapid train moves on the rails by the mechanical spring.</li>
<li>The plane moves propellers from the mechanism in its base.</li>
<li>Cars have clockwork mechanism and a steering system.</li>
<li>You can open the hood and see the way the mechanism works.</li>
<li>The Timer keeps the time.</li>
<li>The Tank overcomes the obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our team consists of engineers, designers and technologists. More than 20 people work for Time for Machine in total.</p>
<p>Time for Machine company was founded in 2016. We have already had one successful kickstarter project in 2017. There were very few people in the team in those years. During the further development and execution of the previous Kickstarter we grew and gained experience. We replaced laser cutting production with chemical etching. This made the models much better and the edges of the parts safer. We redesigned the packaging and made it comfortable and elegant.</p>
<p>Several experienced designers joined our team from my past “Ugears” project. I would like to remind everyone that Time for Machine is a completely new project that has nothing to do with Ugears.</p>
<p>All this has led to the fact that we have a wide range of models and experience in their production.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>What we have:</p>
<p>1) Our own manufacture and many years of experience in business project management. We are confident in our ability to create original assembly models and bring joy to all those who supported us.</p>
<p>2) Experience in delivery and international transportation.<br/>3) We have a well thought out plan how to proceed after the end of the project.<br/>4) Our main marketing strategy is based on a true passion for mechanics and love for our work.</p>
<p>Our team is constantly engaged in developing of natural innovative models. This project is an extension of what we have achieved till now.</p>
<p>Our team is continuously working on new fascinating ideas for metal models. Current project will broaden and develop further what we have already achieved. With the support of Kickstarter – your support – Time For Machine can cross the borders of one country and offer our models to the world.</p>

</div></div>","All models
 

From the most ancient times, we’ve been attracted by items made with soul, sense and idea. People put a lot of effort into design and technological advances of cars, mechanisms, planes and steam engines. Even after lots of time these items still captivate our minds just like the mechanical automatons of the past and figures by such wizards as Peter Carl Fabergé. Their inventions are presented in museums and exhibited in private collections.
In the modern world, due to modern technologies there is a possibility to become a wizard by yourself and you personally can create something as attractive and innovative.
That’s why we have set the goal to create the most beautiful construction set in the world. The set ,which you can easily assemble into a mechanical piece of art. Time for machine is the first exclusive construction set worth your attention.
We have already had a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2017. It was our first step, when we showed our first four models and fulfilled our obligations. Since that time we have fine-tuned our product, removed all shortcomings, reached better results in designing and assembling the models.
It's time to assemble
It’s time to Construct
Time For Machine is a new perspective in the world of construction sets - unique models made of metal, which you can personally assemble.
Each model has a detailed instruction in several languages. However, the assembling process will be much easier if you watch our video instructions. These video lessons will help you with mechanics and STEM 101.Inside the package you’ll see the special black envelope divided into sections. Special plates with metal parts will be inside. They're produced by chemical etching method and have smoothed and safe edges. Due to the special connections all parts can be easily separated from the plate. Parts can be easily bent by hands. In special the bottom compartments there are gears made of thick metal and a block with spring . Some models have special plywood moulds which can help to adjust the form of some elements of the model.
Each model can be assembled by using only tiny pliers. Parts are connected with each other with the easy twist of eyering. We also offer a set of professional assembling tools, which include 2 different types of pliers, 2 files and polishing cloth.

Dazzling Steamliner

All our models are mechanical and have their own story. Movement of a gear wheel is movement of life. Covered in bright armor this mechanism will become a real centerpiece of your interior and a useful gift to a friend.

The rapid train moves on the rails by the mechanical spring.
The plane moves propellers from the mechanism in its base.
Cars have clockwork mechanism and a steering system.
You can open the hood and see the way the mechanism works.
The Timer keeps the time.
The Tank overcomes the obstacles.

The ideal construction set shouldn’t only be attractive but also move beautifully. Heavenly Hercules


 

 

 Dazzling Steamliner
 

Model of a steamliner from universe of steampunk and dieselpunk, which resembles historical steamliners, which were covered in a sleek aerodynamic body.

It's time for team

Our team consists of engineers, designers and technologists. More than 20 people work for Time for Machine in total.
Time for Machine company was founded in 2016. We have already had one successful kickstarter project in 2017. There were very few people in the team in those years. During the further development and execution of the previous Kickstarter we grew and gained experience. We replaced laser cutting production with chemical etching. This made the models much better and the edges of the parts safer. We redesigned the packaging and made it comfortable and elegant.
Several experienced designers joined our team from my past “Ugears” project. I would like to remind everyone that Time for Machine is a completely new project that has nothing to do with Ugears.
All this has led to the fact that we have a wide range of models and experience in their production.
Freedom. Wisdom. Interaction. 
Our team
We develop our models in Ukraine and also now we have a team in the USA.

Risks and challenges
What we have:
1) Our own manufacture and many years of experience in business project management. We are confident in our ability to create original assembly models and bring joy to all those who supported us.
2) Experience in delivery and international transportation.3) We have a well thought out plan how to proceed after the end of the project.4) Our main marketing strategy is based on a true passion for mechanics and love for our work.
Our team is constantly engaged in developing of natural innovative models. This project is an extension of what we have achieved till now.
Our team is continuously working on new fascinating ideas for metal models. Current project will broaden and develop further what we have already achieved. With the support of Kickstarter – your support – Time For Machine can cross the borders of one country and offer our models to the world.",64.0,20,"4 Campaigns

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Can I use other BitMessage clients to read the mails?</h4>
<p>No: FlowingMail is not compatible with BitMessage.</p>
<h4>Can I use BitTorrent clients to read the mails?</h4>
<p>No: While FlowingMail takes a lot of concepts from BitTorrent, it is not compatible with BitTorrent</p>
<h4>Which language do you use to program the API &amp; the clients?</h4>
<p>C++ and C++/Java for Android</p>
<h4>What if I turn off my device? Will I receive the mails sent while it was turned off?</h4>
<p>Yes, your mails are stored on other peers (encrypted) for up to 7 days. The sender also stores the sent mail and will re-announce it after 7 days if you weren’t able to download it.</p>
<h4>Can I send/receive attachments?</h4>
<p>You can send anything that you can send in a regular e-mail, including attachments, HTML formatted emails, etc.</p>
<h4>How does an user’s address look like?</h4>
<p>FM-2D9dmezW8BYTi4EQTy3ncDFJXq2Znkk4mU</p>
<h4>Are the mails encrypted?</h4>
<p>Yes, the mails are signed and encrypted</p>
<p>When a client boots for the first time then it creates two private/public key pairs: the public keys are distributed to other peers and are used to encrypt the messages and to verify the sender’s signature, while the private keys are kept secret and are used to decrypt the received messages and to sign the outgoing ones.</p>
<h4>Why so much time to develop the clients? Once the protocol API is read it should be a walk in the park!</h4>
<p>Well...no. When the beta versions of the client get out of the door then the number of users will increase dramatically and the FlowingMail protocol may crack under pressure: in this case some resources must be dedicated to fix the FlowingMail protocol to address the issues.</p>
<h4>If the source code is available to everybody, what do the perks offer? Can’t I build the clients by myself from the source code?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can build the clients all by yourself from the source code.</p>
<p>The perks allow non-technical users to download the installation packages of the clients and tools, so they don’t need to install compilers, libraries, build and dependency managers, etc...</p>

FlowingMail is an easy to use P2P secure and encrypted email system.


Decentralized: no central server is involved in the transmission of the mail. The mails don't transit through GMail, Yahoo, NSA, etc...
Encrypted: all the messages are always automatically encrypted, without user intervention nor complicated setup operations

Verified: the addresses of the senders and recipients cannot be forged

The most used email systems rely on a central server that receives, stores and forward the messages.
The recent news about PRISM and the closure of Lavabit shown that users cannot rely on such systems for private communications and for an uninterrupted service.
When a central server is involved in the communication then it’s easy to identify the parties that have to be searched, closed down or threatened in order to retrieve the messages that are sent through the network.
The FlowingMail protocol is loosely based on BitTorrent, with some ideas coming from the BitMessage protocol.
The FlowingMail messages are automatically signed and encrypted: only the receiver is able to decrypt the messages.

What We Need & What You Get
Goals
The goals of this project are:

beta version of the FlowingMail protocol by December 2013
produce a reference API, a series of command line tools that test, validate and use the FlowingMail protocol by February 2013
produce a FlowingMail client application for Windows, Linux and Mac by June 2014
produce a FlowingMail client application for Android by October 2014
play with the FlowingMail protocol and fine tune the clients and continuously improve the protocol
install FlowingMail nodes around the world to help the FlowingMail network
develop an SMTP to FlowingMail gateway that convert normal emails to FlowingMail & viceversa before they leave your premises.

The ultimate goal is to boost the adoption of FlowingMail as an email protocol, so all the software will be released under an open source license (Apache or BSD license) while the protocol will be in the public domain
Timeline

December 2013: beta version of the protocol ready
June 2014: Desktop clients ready
October 2014: Android client ready
December 2014: SMTP to FlowingMail gateway ready

What we need
The 100.000 USD will be spent for:

pay full time development for 2 software developers for one year
rent for the office and expenses
rent for bandwidth and servers around the globe
taxes :-(
What if we don’t reach the goal?
Well, plan B is to work on the protocol until we run out of money, then try a new fundraising and hope that the work done will convince more people to donate for the development.
The protocol specifications will be in the public domain to allow anyone to pick up our work and continue the development.

Features of the FlowingMail protocol
Different keys for encryption and signatures


FlowingMail uses two different pairs of RSA private/public keys for encryption and signature. This allow to periodically change the encryption key which will be redistributed automatically to other peers.Addresses cannot be forged
FlowingMail addresses are a human readable representation of 160 bit hashes (SHA-1) of the public key used to verify the signature. Nodes that announce wrong keys (because the SHA-1 hash is wrong) are banned by other nodes.The encryption public key can have expiration date and is signed using the signing private key.Nodes don't need to be always online
Public keys and available mails are always available on the network, even when the recipient node is offline
A variant of the Kademlia DHT stores:

the public keys
the list of available mails for the recipients
the list of nodes that store a specific mail message torrent file
the list of nodes that store specific blocks of an email message
Mails are signed by the sender
Mails are signed using the signing RSA private key and encrypted using the recipient RSA encryption public key.High speed
All the communication between the DHT nodes and the mail transfers happen over UDT protocol (UDP Based Data Transfer), which provides high speed data transfer (with guarantee of delivery) or partial reliability on message delivery.
The transmission of the mails happens in a bittorrent-like fashion: the nodes download the least distributed blocks of the mail from the sender and make it available to the recipient.

FAQ
Can I use other BitMessage clients to read the mails?
No: FlowingMail is not compatible with BitMessage.
Can I use BitTorrent clients to read the mails?
No: While FlowingMail takes a lot of concepts from BitTorrent, it is not compatible with BitTorrent
Which language do you use to program the API & the clients?
C++ and C++/Java for Android
What if I turn off my device? Will I receive the mails sent while it was turned off?
Yes, your mails are stored on other peers (encrypted) for up to 7 days. The sender also stores the sent mail and will re-announce it after 7 days if you weren’t able to download it.
Can I send/receive attachments?
You can send anything that you can send in a regular e-mail, including attachments, HTML formatted emails, etc.
How does an user’s address look like?
FM-2D9dmezW8BYTi4EQTy3ncDFJXq2Znkk4mU
Are the mails encrypted?
Yes, the mails are signed and encrypted
When a client boots for the first time then it creates two private/public key pairs: the public keys are distributed to other peers and are used to encrypt the messages and to verify the sender’s signature, while the private keys are kept secret and are used to decrypt the received messages and to sign the outgoing ones.
Why so much time to develop the clients? Once the protocol API is read it should be a walk in the park!
Well...no. When the beta versions of the client get out of the door then the number of users will increase dramatically and the FlowingMail protocol may crack under pressure: in this case some resources must be dedicated to fix the FlowingMail protocol to address the issues.
If the source code is available to everybody, what do the perks offer? Can’t I build the clients by myself from the source code?
Yes, you can build the clients all by yourself from the source code.
The perks allow non-technical users to download the installation packages of the clients and tools, so they don’t need to install compilers, libraries, build and dependency managers, etc...

I'm excited you are reading this and allow me to share this great development with you! Let's release something spectacular together!</p><p>Having been active in the Oracle industry for close to 15 years, where it's been both my job and my hobby to understand the Oracle database and how it functions; I am totally fascinated by the Oracle database and its immense depth and vast array of features. </p><p>Here's what others have to say about me:</p><p><i>""I am excited about the possibilities that an open framework like zztat is opening up for changing reactive database administration to a proactive and self-healing system. Stefan has been studying Oracle internals extensively and is the perfect guy to drive a project like this forward."" - Bjoern Rost, Oracle ACE Director.</i></p><p>Where complex systems interact, such as is the case with the Oracle database and the applications that run on top of it, unexpected behavior can often be the result. This may be intimidating to administrators, both new and experienced alike. </p><p>In today's fast paced world, where outages can quickly result in financial losses, people are kept awake at night by their pagers and cell phones to ensure systems run stable. I have seen hundreds of different environments throughout my consulting career, and I have witnessed the pressure this type of work can have first hand.</p><p>But it doesn't have be this way.</p><p>More often than not, people are alerted and pulled out of bed for minor issues. For simple issues that could be avoided entirely. For recurring situations that require nothing but a command or two to resolve. </p><p>Things that can be automated.</p><p>And that's why I decided to release this product. </p><p>I'd like you to sleep comfortably. Knowing that your database is in good hands. Log off at night not having to worry about getting called at 3 AM because disk space runs low. Not being paged because someone left his client open and is blocking the nightly batch job. </p><p>I'd like you to have powerful tools at your disposal that make diagnosing issues such as contentions a breeze. You won't have to google around to look for some script of which you are not confident it's safe to run on your production database.</p><p>Those are things of the past. </p><p> </p><h2>The History</h2><p>The original idea of zztat ("" See-Stat"") was born on June 29, 2014, which marked its very first commit on github. It started as a little tool that I wrote myself in order to support a web-application I worked on, which ran on Oracle Standard Edition One: an edition of the Oracle database with limited monitoring functionality. Said application unfortunately had to be abandoned due to Oracle's licensing changes on September 1st, 2015 which made it impossible to fund the immensely increased licensing cost of running the new Oracle Standard Edition 2 as a hobby. This unfortunate turn of events, however, has not stopped the idea of zztat. </p><p>In May 2017 an opportunity presented itself and I decided to work on zztat full-time. I completed the whole framework, added loads more functionality to it and built an array of test cases. And most recently, I started building the wiki to document it all.</p><p>And that's where we stand right now.</p><ul>
<li>The zztat framework is feature-complete and stable.</li>
<li>Basic metrics are in place and supported by gauges and standard reactions.</li>
<li>Sophisticated hi-speed sampling for mutexes, latches and session waits is in place.</li>
<li>The first add-on for audit data management is complete.</li>
<li>Product documentation exists in the form of a wiki; albeit it needs more work to be complete.</li>
<li>... and the entire framework is fully customizable!</li>
</ul><p>What's still needed is a solid range of standard metrics that will ship with zztat by default. And it needs a GUI to be accessible to a wider range of Oracle DBAs. Not everyone likes to type in commands using sql*plus. </p><p>And this is where I need you, potential backers! Running development and sandbox environments costs money. Running massive tests takes a lot of infrastructure and costs money. Software costs money. </p><p>And I'm so close! This is why I have the privilege of asking only for support to see through the beta testing phase and the finishing touches - I don't need to ask people to fund my entire development cycle from start to finish - that's already done and was funded by myself. </p><p> </p><h2>This Campaign and The Future</h2><p>This campaign will deliver the following agenda:</p><h3>September</h3><p>The campaign month. It's your opportunity to get zztat at a discounted price, participate in the direction of the final development stage and say ""Yes! I'd like to run this in my environment""!</p><p>I will continue to work on zztat and provide 2-3 updates each week right here on the campaign page and with way more details over on the zztat blog at <a href=""https://zztat.net/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://zztat.net/blog</a>. If reading a technical blog isn't really your cup of tea, you can follow us on Twitter @zztat_oracle or on Facebook at <a href=""https://fb.me/zztat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://fb.me/zztat</a>. The blog as well as the Twitter and Facebook pages have been created specifically for this campaign. </p><p>The main goal for September is getting the beta version released and allow you all to experience this amazing framework hands-on. </p><h3>October</h3><p>When this campaign officially closes, beta testing will begin with each and every backer receiving their own trial license and a copy of the first beta release of zztat. </p><p>What I expect from beta testing is to get valuable feedback from all of you to learn what works and what doesn't work on your particular environment. What default thresholds are too high or too low. What metrics you find useful, and what benefits you the most. </p><h3>November</h3><p>November is the add-on month. As part of the beta testing, it will be decided based on your feedback, which additional add-ons to focus on for release date. </p><p>The following two add-ons will be included in the final release, and are included in the premium package perks - you will be able to use those add-ons for the full year 2018 if you opt for any of the premium perks as part of this campaign.</p><ul><li><strong>zztat Management GUI Add-on</strong></li></ul><p>While zztat is fully functional, writing a few lines of PL/SQL to control it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It needs a GUI to be able to attract a wider audience of users. I have written applications on Oracle's Application Express (APEX) for many years now and it is the perfect choice for zztat due to its native reporting capabilities and interactive nature. APEX will run on the zztat repository database and allow users to control the entire zztat environment from a centralized interface.</p><p><u>This add-on is guaranteed to be included with zztat's release in January 2018.</u></p><ul><li><strong>Auditing Add-On</strong></li></ul><p>Security and auditing are becoming more and more important in today's industry. This raises a lot of questions on how to manage all that data, and what to do with it. The auditing add-on enables you to automatically collect audit data and analyze it, using the full power of the zztat framework, including automated reactions.</p><p><u>This add-on is guaranteed to be included with zztat's release in January 2018.</u></p><p> </p><p>One of the following add-ons will be chosen by you, the backers, to be included on release date: </p><ul><li><strong>Diagnostics &amp; Tuning Pack Add-on</strong></li></ul><p>Out of the box, zztat runs on any edition of the Oracle database, be it Standard Edition 1 or 2, or Enterprise Edition. Regardless of which options you have licensed for your database. The Diag &amp; Tuning Pack add-on will include specific metrics and gauges tailored for Enterprise Edition databases that have these packs licensed with Oracle. It will include features such as ASH data mining, AWR data mining and archival to preserve the history.</p><p>Ever found out about an issue only to realize the data you needed to diagnose it had already aged out of v$active_session_history? And the archival in dba_hist_active_session_history wasn't precise enough due to it only containing 1/10th of the original data? With this add-on, that will not happen anymore. The data will be available when you need it.</p><p>Oracle 12c now has a built-in AWR warehouse feature. But 90% of that data you are likely to never use. With this add-on you can archive just the data you choose, for as long as you need it.</p><ul><li><strong>Alert log scanner add-on</strong></li></ul><p>Automatically monitoring the database alert log from within the database is the key feature of this add-on. Integrated into zztat's framework, zztat will be able to automatically react to specific messages when they are detected in the alert log. Your feedback during beta testing will be invaluable to determine which messages to prioritize and how to best react to them.</p><p>It's important to note that this will be a fully intra-database solution - there will be no external operating system processes or jobs of any kind involved. As the rest of zztat itself, it will be pure SQL and PL/SQL.</p><ul><li><strong>File-based Synchronization add-on</strong></li></ul><p><strong>​</strong>All data from the target databases as well as internal communication such as metadata synchronization between the repository and the target databases currently happens via a database link. This may not be suitable for some environments, particularly the more security-critical ones. With this add-on, database links are eliminated, and the synchronization is performed through file exchange instead. </p><p>Further add-ons that will be developed <u>after the initial zztat release in Q2-Q4 2018</u>:</p><ul>
<li><strong>RAC Support Add-on</strong></li>
<li><strong>Data Guard Add-on</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cloud Control Plug-in Add-on</strong></li>
</ul><h3>December</h3><p>December is the month to get ready for the release in January. It will be all about polishing the product, squashing any leftover bugs discovered during the beta testing phase, and making sure that you're getting a true Swiss quality software product. </p><p>The final task for December will be to ensure the documentation is 100% complete and documents everything you need to make the most out of zztat. </p><h3><strong>January 10th, 2018: Public release!</strong></h3><h3> </h3><h2>Packages &amp; Licenses</h2><p>zztat can be licensed in various database packages bundled with one of two available support models: basic and premium support. </p><h3>Official zztat Documents</h3><p>The zztat price list: <a href=""https://zztat.net/pricelist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zztat.net/pricelist</a></p><p>The zztat license agreement: <a href=""https://zztat.net/license"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zztat.net/license</a></p><p>The zztat trial license agreement: <a href=""https://zztat.net/trial_license"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://zztat.net/trial_license</a> </p><p>For the duration of the beta testing phase you will receive a trial license which will expire in January 2018. Backers who purchase a full zztat basic or premium package, will receive a full license agreement in January 2018.</p><h3>Basic Package</h3><p>The basic package includes a fully functional copy of zztat with a license that is valid for 1 year, without add-ons. </p><p>If you opt for the basic package you will receive access to technical support:</p><ul>
<li>Direct email contact with zztat support via support@zztat.net.</li>
<li>A guaranteed response via three business days. Likely to be quicker, but never later.</li>
<li>New product versions and patches will be made available to you when they are released.</li>
</ul><h3>Premium Package</h3><p>The premium package includes a fully functional copy of zztat with a license that is valid for 1 year. Additionally, the premium package allows you to customize your zztat installation even further through its various available add-ons. </p><p>If you opt for the premium package you will receive access to technical support:</p><ul>
<li>Direct email contact with zztat support via support@zztat.net.</li>
<li>Response guaranteed within 24 hours during business days.</li>
<li>Priority handling of support requests.</li>
<li>At additional charge, zztat installation &amp; configuration on premises, or remotely. Contact us for details. Please note that this is available in a very limited fashion during 2017 as the focus lies on the crowdfunding campaign and getting zztat released.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2><h3>The Campaign</h3><p><i>Q: Why Crowdfunding?</i></p><p>A: When this project became serious last May I didn't fully anticipate that it would grow to something of this magnitude. But I've had so many ideas that would turn this into the fantastic framework that it is today. And I wanted to deliver the best I possibly could. If you're browsing around on the zztat wiki (<a href=""http://www.zztat.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zztat.net</a>) you will quickly see that the framework is very feature-rich. There's virtually nothing that it can't do in an elegant and integrated fashion.</p><p>Now, with 4 months passed I am running low on resources. Crowdfunding hasn't actually occurred to me as a way forward until a friend of mine pointed it out to me. I have come to love the idea and, well, here we are now!</p><p> </p><p><i>Q: Why $15000?</i></p><p>A: This amount of money will be enough to sustain a full-fledged environment for development and testing of the software to get it ready for release. I have been using Amazon's EC2 for many years now and the cost can quickly grow once you start running read and write-intensive workloads. I expect around 30-40% of the money to go into platform costs. </p><p>Advertising will be another large contributor to the total cost to ensure a successful launch. While I have a fairly large network of contacts thanks to many different consulting engagements for many years, having sufficient funding for advertising will ensure a good global reach to make the product known and available to the people that can benefit from it the most. I'd expect around 30% of the money to go into advertising.</p><p>The remainder of the funds will cover my personal expenses and ensure that I have internet access, a place to live in and food on the table while I work towards release the following three months.</p><p> </p><h3>Licensing</h3><p><i>Q: Why the basic / premium and add-on based licensing model?</i></p><p>A: I believe that this model provides the most flexible pricing model to ensure that you get access to the functionality you really need. If you are a team of tech-savvy DBAs that rarely touch the mouse, zztat basic is really all you need. This allows such organizations to benefit from an extremely low price compared to other professional monitoring solutions in the market today. </p><p>Other environments may be more focused on different database software and be running MYSQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL, etc and may have limited Oracle knowledge. For this type of environment, the GUI-based premium package is more suitable. </p><p><i>Q: Do you offer larger discounted bundles than the 3-and 5-database packages listed here?</i></p><p>A: Yes! If you would like obtain a larger bundle, please do not hesitate to let us know by sending an email to info@zztat.net. We'll be glad to add it to the campaign here, at a discounted rate.

<p><strong>Proximity Detection and Locator </strong></p>
<p>You can extend the maximum distance between the child wearing a <strong>Wootch</strong> and your Smartphone/Tablet up to 20 metres (65 feet). Perfect for when you are in the park/supermarket/shopping centre to avoid those moments when your child does wander off and panic takes over wondering where your child has gone!</p>

<p><strong>Wootch</strong> also has a built-in ‘FindMe’ button your child can press within a 50 metre (164 feet) range. This alerts your Smartphone/Tablet so you are aware your child needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>Through the QL-Find app you will also be able to establish the last seen location via the Maps application on your Smartphone/Tablet.  </p>
<p>There is also a near/far (similar to hot and cold) gauge you can use to assist you with locating your child.</p>

<p><strong>Wootch</strong> also has added security features, such as the ‘<em><strong>Device Lock</strong></em>’. This prevents the <strong>Wootch</strong> from being turned off without your permission.</p>
<p><strong>The Wootch is also perfect for large families, family day outs and child minders as you can have up to ten Wootchs running from your Smartphone/Tablet. You can also rename each individual Wootch to reflect the name of the child within the QL-Find app</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth 4.0</strong></p>
<p>QL-Find is powered using Bluetooth 4.0 technology. The benefit of this is it minimises the battery consumption on both your Bluetooth 4.0 Smartphone/Tablet and your <strong>Wootch</strong>.</p>

<h1>Setting up your Wootch </h1>
<p><strong>Setting up your Wootch is simple.</strong></p>
<img alt=""Wootch Setup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0169/6958/files/Wootch_Setup.png?2164"" src="""" style=""""/>
<h1>Compatibility</h1>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Wootch</strong> is currently compatible with HTC One/One X+, Samsung Galaxy S4/S4 Mini/S3/S3 Mini, iPhone 4S/5, iPad 3/4, iPad Mini, iPod Touch (5th generation).</p>
<h1>Community Source Tracking if you happen to loose Bluetooth Connection</h1>
<p>We want to build a community of Wootch users, as parents, guardians or child minders. Lets help each other out.</p>
<p>If your Wootch looses Bluetooth connection, it will automaticially get picked up by another wootch user in the same area, our server will automatically send you an update location with the GPS coordinates, data charges will be applicable dependant on your network operator. This is an opt in service.</p>
<h1>Where we are at? </h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are approaching the end of development of both the <strong>Wootch</strong> and accompanying app for iOS devices. At present there is no native Android support for Bluetooth 4.0, so we are developing apps using Samsung and HTC’s own Bluetooth BLE APIs. We will also develop an app for Windows Phone 8 devices once Bluetooth 4.0 support is added (expected with release of Windows Phone 8.1).</p>
<p>Upon receipt of Indiegogo funding we will order the final printed circuits boards and plastics housings, that will be used for the testing required for CE, FCC and Bluetooth certification. We will also develop the <strong>Wootch</strong> further and make it rechargeable. We feel these are all the elements missing and once added it will meet parents needs. </p>
<p>CE certification means <strong>Wootch</strong> complies with all safety &amp; environmental requirements to sell the <strong>Wootch</strong> within the European market. FCC certification means <strong>Wootchs</strong> electromagnet interference is within limits required to sell the <strong>Wootch</strong> in the US market.</p>
<p>We (QL London) attended CES 2013 Las Vegas the initial concept was showcased. We have since developed the software and firmware further to include a digital clock, integrate maps for 'last seen', reduced the minimum range from 10m/32ft  to 5m/16ft and added wireless software updates.</p>
<p>The first version of the app that was used for the CES exhibition is already in the app store, under our previous name NearTooth. A new version of the App, re-branded as QL-Find, will be available updated on iTunes and launched on Google Play. . </p>
<h1><strong>Technical specification </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Wootch</strong> uses the latest Bluetooth 4.0 technology to connect to your Smartphone/Tablet. This version of Bluetooth is designed for extreme low power devices to ensure maximum battery life. Dependent on usage, <strong>Wootchs</strong> battery will last up to one month after each time being fully charged.<br/><em>*Based on Wootch being switched on and connected to a compatible Smartphone/Tablet for four hours per day.</em></p>
<p>When the <strong>Wootch</strong> connects to your compatible Bluetooth 4.0 Smartphone/Tablet it synchronises with the time of your phone, so you don’t need to set the time on the Wootch itself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h1>Recommendations</h1>
We strongly recommend you educate your child on the following; <br/>
<ul>
<li>They should not take <strong>Wootch</strong> off unless they tell you prior to doing so.</li>
<li>The panic button which activates the '<em><strong>FindMe</strong></em>' alert should only be pressed when your child/children requires immediate attention.</li>
<li>Your child should remove their <strong>Wootch</strong> before they go into the bath or shower.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1><strong>To Recap, QL Wootch;</strong></h1>
<p>1) Alerts you via your Bluetooth 4.0 Smartphone/Tablet when your child is approx. more than 5 metres/16ft away*</p>
<p>2) <strong>Wootch</strong> has a built-in panic alarm that will, when pressed, send a Find Me alerts to your Bluetooth 4.0 Smartphone/Tablet via the QL-Find App within a 50m/164ft range when pressed by your child. When this is pressed by your child it means they require your immediate attention.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Wootch</strong> also has a built in digital clock to help your child tell the time.</p>
<p>4) <strong>Wootch</strong> is recommended for children 2-11 years old. </p>
<p>5) <strong>Wootch</strong> is rechargeable so you won't have to worry about changing batteries, simply recharge it as you would your Smartphone/Tablet.</p>

<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
<p>The main challenge we have faced has been keeping our production costs as low as possible. Our main objective is to make <strong>Wootch</strong> at an accessible price point so it is affordable for all parents. With the assistance of Indiegogo patriots, we will be able to achieve the target RRP £29.99.</p>
<p>We wanted to make a product that did not use GPS, as we felt we wanted to alert you prior to your child going missing. We believe this is an affordable price point for a parent/guardians peace of mind. We hope you do too!</p>
<p>We already have working samples of <strong>Wootch</strong> and know we can deliver on our promise. Majority of the risks we initially had have already been addressed.

CE certification means Wootch complies with all safety & environmental requirements to sell the Wootch within the European market. FCC certification means Wootchs electromagnet interference is within limits required to sell the Wootch in the US market.

X-Bows was designed to limit the stress on your hands and wrists while also providing a productive and stylish typing experience.</p><div data-id=""18253589""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511801854/nrom9og0tpgsezrzcomc.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>The Normal Keyboard Works Fine. Why Redesign It?</b></p><p>The traditional staggered QWERTY layout was not designed to be comfortable. Its design comes directly from typewriters of the 1800s and very little about it has changed since then.</p><p>The traditional keyboard layout causes our wrists to flex inwards at an unnatural angle while we type. With over-exposure, this wrist angling very often leads to discomfort or injury. We designed the layout of X-Bows to conform to our natural wrist angle and arranged the keys in an ortho-linear fashion (fancy way to say straight line) because that better aligns with the natural extension plane of our fingers. The reason that typewriters originally popularized the staggered key layout was so that their levers wouldn't jam - not exactly a modern concern.</p><div data-id=""18255280""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511801854/twkn6eb9ljyxsjr9hdm9.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1> </h1><h1><b>Design</b></h1><p>X-Bows was designed with three criteria in mind:</p><ul>
<li>Enhancing the comfort and ergonomics of the keyboard</li>
<li>Limiting the learning curve for our new layout</li>
<li>Creating an attractive design</li>
</ul><p>Every decision we made was to fulfill one of these criteria. Here’s what we came up with:</p><p><b>Cross-Radial Design </b></p><p>The most noticeable and unique feature of X-Bows is certainly its key layout. The key columns are angled to promote a more natural angle for our wrists.</p><p>Moving the ENTER, Backspace, SHIFT and ALT keys into the center of the keyboard achieves two things:</p><ul>
<li>First, it limits stress on the pinky, our weakest finger. The thumb is very underused on traditional keyboard layouts so repositioning these keys utilizes it without adding undue stress. </li>
<li>Second, it makes these keys much easier to reach. On traditional typewriters these keys didn’t exist, had limited functionality, or had completely different functions. They were simply tacked onto the side of the keyboard. Making these keys easier to reach allows you to get more done when you’re typing and reduces the need to move your whole hand to reach a key - one of the most fatiguing acts in typing.</li>
</ul><p>We think it looks pretty cool too. </p><div data-id=""18242286""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511801855/pdgraen0omxymfxd6cq4.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Limited learning curve</b></p><p>Do you remember when you were learning to type? It takes a lot of time and practice to develop the muscle memory in our fingers that allows us to type quickly and accurately.</p><p>X-Bows is not the first ergonomic keyboard ever created. Plenty of people have identified that the keyboard layout that we use could be dramatically improved. The biggest impediment to these keyboards gaining broader acceptance is that they require users to learn a whole new layout. Busy people inevitably get frustrated and revert back to their old keyboard when they need to work faster. Despite best intentions, a lot of ergonomic keyboards end up in a drawer never to be used again.</p><p>With X-Bows, we were dedicated to making that learning curve as manageable as possible. The letter keys have not moved from their QWERTY layout. Your right index finger is still hitting “J” and your left ring finger is still responsible for typing “W”. You don’t need to memorize a new key layout, your hands already know where all of the letters are on X-Bows.</p><p>The keys that we did move- ENTER, Backspace, ALT and Control- can also be found on the right side of the keyboard. We call these our “training wheel keys”. While we think that the keys in the middle are more convenient, as you’re beginning to type on X-Bows, it is no problem if you find yourself reaching for the backspace in the top-right. They are there while you adjust. Since X-Bows' keys are fully remappable, once you find yourself no longer needing these training wheel keys, you can program them to become shortcuts or macros; increasing your productivity even further!</p><p>While you won’t be able to take X-Bows out of the box and feel 100% comfortable typing on it immediately. Our testers have all reported adjusting to the new layout in under a week, some in as little as two days. Compared to other ergonomic boards that can take a month or more to adjust to, X-Bows makes ergonomic typing more accessible than ever before.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""18297478""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Johnny, a developer in San Francisco was one of our first Facebook fans.

In his practice, Dr. Wang was seeing a similar injury over and over again. Office workers, writers, and programmers were repeatedly coming to him complaining of pain, weakness, and fatigue in their hands, wrists, forearms and shoulders. These are the easily identifiable symptoms of RSI- repetitive strain injury, caused by stress on joints from typing for prolonged hours on a standard keyboard. Dr. Wang sought to find a preventative solution for his patients. </p><p>Over many months of determining the medical strengths and weaknesses of other ergonomic keyboards both past and present, Dr. Wang began to form his own opinion about the ideal design for a computer keyboard. The problem with ordinary keyboards was obvious to Dr. Wang - they weren’t designed to conform to the natural structure of people’s hands. The problem with the ergonomic keyboards currently on the market was simply that people were not using them. Dr. Wang recognized that the main deterrent of most ergonomic keyboards was the steep learning curve; most workers did not have the free time to spend weeks or months learning how to type on a new, often radically different keyboard layout. </p><p>Raising money on Kickstarter will allow us to manufacture at the scale required to produce X-Bows at a reasonable cost. Our design is finalized and our prototype units are fully functional and have been successfully produced at a small scale. Now, we just need a kickstart to scale up our production.</p><p><b>X-Bows' Team</b></p><div data-id=""18256382""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511801874/pww4fn23atehbw3ntjgj.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><b>...</b></p><div data-id=""18253645""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1511801876/fg3jmrum6sorvfpb12zi.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p></div>","Web Store is Online!Learn more at: https://x-bows.com/
  How Much Time Do You Spend Typing?If you spend your work days in front of a computer, you have likely felt some discomfort after a long day of typing. While spending less time on our computers would be the ideal remedy for this problem, that is not a realistic solution for most people. X-Bows was designed to limit the stress on your hands and wrists while also providing a productive and stylish typing experience. The Normal Keyboard Works Fine. Why Redesign It?The traditional staggered QWERTY layout was not designed to be comfortable. Its design comes directly from typewriters of the 1800s and very little about it has changed since then.The traditional keyboard layout causes our wrists to flex inwards at an unnatural angle while we type. With over-exposure, this wrist angling very often leads to discomfort or injury. We designed the layout of X-Bows to conform to our natural wrist angle and arranged the keys in an ortho-linear fashion (fancy way to say straight line) because that better aligns with the natural extension plane of our fingers. The reason that typewriters originally popularized the staggered key layout was so that their levers wouldn't jam - not exactly a modern concern. DesignX-Bows was designed with three criteria in mind:
Enhancing the comfort and ergonomics of the keyboard
Limiting the learning curve for our new layout
Creating an attractive design
Every decision we made was to fulfill one of these criteria. Here’s what we came up with:Cross-Radial Design The most noticeable and unique feature of X-Bows is certainly its key layout. The key columns are angled to promote a more natural angle for our wrists.Moving the ENTER, Backspace, SHIFT and ALT keys into the center of the keyboard achieves two things:
First, it limits stress on the pinky, our weakest finger. The thumb is very underused on traditional keyboard layouts so repositioning these keys utilizes it without adding undue stress. 
Second, it makes these keys much easier to reach. On traditional typewriters these keys didn’t exist, had limited functionality, or had completely different functions. They were simply tacked onto the side of the keyboard. Making these keys easier to reach allows you to get more done when you’re typing and reduces the need to move your whole hand to reach a key - one of the most fatiguing acts in typing.
We think it looks pretty cool too.  Limited learning curveDo you remember when you were learning to type? It takes a lot of time and practice to develop the muscle memory in our fingers that allows us to type quickly and accurately.X-Bows is not the first ergonomic keyboard ever created. Plenty of people have identified that the keyboard layout that we use could be dramatically improved. The biggest impediment to these keyboards gaining broader acceptance is that they require users to learn a whole new layout. Busy people inevitably get frustrated and revert back to their old keyboard when they need to work faster. Despite best intentions, a lot of ergonomic keyboards end up in a drawer never to be used again.With X-Bows, we were dedicated to making that learning curve as manageable as possible. The letter keys have not moved from their QWERTY layout. Your right index finger is still hitting “J” and your left ring finger is still responsible for typing “W”. You don’t need to memorize a new key layout, your hands already know where all of the letters are on X-Bows.The keys that we did move- ENTER, Backspace, ALT and Control- can also be found on the right side of the keyboard. We call these our “training wheel keys”. While we think that the keys in the middle are more convenient, as you’re beginning to type on X-Bows, it is no problem if you find yourself reaching for the backspace in the top-right. They are there while you adjust. Since X-Bows' keys are fully remappable, once you find yourself no longer needing these training wheel keys, you can program them to become shortcuts or macros; increasing your productivity even further!While you won’t be able to take X-Bows out of the box and feel 100% comfortable typing on it immediately. Our testers have all reported adjusting to the new layout in under a week, some in as little as two days. Compared to other ergonomic boards that can take a month or more to adjust to, X-Bows makes ergonomic typing more accessible than ever before. Johnny, a developer in San Francisco was one of our first Facebook fans. We sent him a pre-production X-Bows and he reported being comfortable with the new layout in under a week StylishWe didn’t want X-Bows to look like something that your doctor prescribed to you. We didn’t want it to look completely alien to the rest of your desk set-up. We designed X-Bows to have a minimalist aesthetic and a manageable profile. You can easily carry X-Bows with you for a day of work on your laptop outside of the office.   Our design has already caught the attention of a lot of media: Want to write about X-Bows?

Expert reviews of Gateron switches are overwhelmingly positive. The switches have an estimated lifetime of 50 million clicks- the highest on the market.With X-Bows you have the option of 6 different switch types ranging from loud and clicky to quiet and linear.Gateron Red switches are quiet with a linear feel and a 45gf actuation force. Gateron Blue switches have a tactile and auditory click when you press them (you can hear it in our video). 55gf actuation force. Gateron Black switches are linear, like the reds. They require a slightly heavier actuation force at 60 gf. Gateron Brown switches offer a tactile bump when pressed but don't have the auditory click that blues have. They require a 45 gf actuation force. These have been our most popular switch in the past.  Gateron Green switches- The Gateron Greens (my personal favourite) are a heavy, clicky switch. They are comparable to the Blues but with a higher actuation force of 80gf. Gateron Silent Red Switches- A brand new switch, released just a few months ago. These are among the most silent mechanical switches on the market. They sound almost the same as typing on a laptop keyboard. They are a linear switch, requiring 45gf actuation force, just like the ordinary reds.

An excellent choice for the office. To order the Silent Black or Brown switches, select a perk that includes the Silent Reds and you will be given the option to change to silent black or silent brown before delivery.  Body ConstructionThe interior of X-Bows features an aluminum alloy plate to prevent board flex and makes for a very solid feel while typing. The bottom of the keyboard is ABS plastic with 5 rubber pads to ensure that the board won't move around while you're typing. X-Bows weighs ~0.8kg. KeycapsX-Bows uses ABS+PC two colour injection molding keycaps. In plain terms: they're nice, durable keycaps and the letters will never fade from them. USB CableX-Bows connects by a USB type C port. We will include a 150cm (just under 5 feet) long USB-C --> regular USB cord in the box.RGB BacklightingRGB backlighting is a controversial issue in the keyboarding community. Often, subpar boards try to make up for their deficiencies with a lot of bright, flashing lights. For this reason, we don’t want to spend too much time on our lighting effects, but c’mon, these are pretty fun.

You can also set specific keys to have designated lighting - gamers might like a glow under WASD (though, we've found that ESDF works best for gaming on X-Bows) or designers might want to highlight their most frequently used shortcuts.  The remapping settings are stored on the keyboard itself - no need to open up the software every time you are typing. You can save 3 key profiles on the keyboard and toggle through them using hot keys. At the moment, X-Bows' software is compatible with WIndows. We are currently working on capatability with Mac and Linux and anticipate it being complete before shipping. A look at the X-Bows software. The interface may change before we ship. Anti-Ghosting“Ghosted keys” occur when several keys (usually 6 or more) are pressed at the same time and one or more strokes is lost because of the abundance of information going to the computer. Most people will never need to press 6 keys all at once, but for those that do, losing one or more of those key strokes is a major problem. X-Bows is 100% anti-ghosting in order to accommodate any key combination that you could possibly throw at it. Optional LayoutsMac KeycapsDue to overwhelming demand, we will be including the option for Mac keycaps. We have reached out to some keycap producers and Mac keycaps are no problem to produce. We will include this as a free option in our backer survey.Apple Layout with Numpad  Regional Layout KeycapsWe will be offering UK, German and Nordic as regional layouts. We apologize to those of you who require other regional layouts as we just don't have enough demand to create the molds for them yet. After our campaign is finished, we will be able to offer additional regional layout keycaps on our web store with a significant discount to our Kickstarter backers. UK Layout German Layout Nordic Layout  X-Bows NumpadOur new numpad is fully programmable and backlit, just like X-Bows. It is standalone and can work on the right or left side of X-Bows, as the connection is magnetic, the numpad should be closely positioned to the keyboard itself. There is also another USB-C connection on the numpad if you would like to use it separate from X-Bows. The numpad's backlighting effects are synchronized with those of X-Bows.
Shells of the first numpads that we produced.
 The numpad will connect to X-Bows via a wireless magnetic transmitter or by a separate USB-C cable. If you use the magnetic transmitter, it will not require the use of a second USB slot on your computer.  Our StoryX-Bows founder, Dr. Sigo Wang, is a medical doctor, specialized in medical imaging. In his practice, Dr. Wang was seeing a similar injury over and over again. Office workers, writers, and programmers were repeatedly coming to him complaining of pain, weakness, and fatigue in their hands, wrists, forearms and shoulders. These are the easily identifiable symptoms of RSI- repetitive strain injury, caused by stress on joints from typing for prolonged hours on a standard keyboard. Dr. Wang sought to find a preventative solution for his patients. Over many months of determining the medical strengths and weaknesses of other ergonomic keyboards both past and present, Dr. Wang began to form his own opinion about the ideal design for a computer keyboard. The problem with ordinary keyboards was obvious to Dr. Wang - they weren’t designed to conform to the natural structure of people’s hands. The problem with the ergonomic keyboards currently on the market was simply that people were not using them. Dr. Wang recognized that the main deterrent of most ergonomic keyboards was the steep learning curve; most workers did not have the free time to spend weeks or months learning how to type on a new, often radically different keyboard layout. Raising money on Kickstarter will allow us to manufacture at the scale required to produce X-Bows at a reasonable cost. Our design is finalized and our prototype units are fully functional and have been successfully produced at a small scale. Now, we just need a kickstart to scale up our production.X-Bows' Team...",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

Why I started this challenge ?
The idea came to me after my different professional experiences in resin formulations, I have been thinking about developing new resins for 3D printer using UV curing technology known as stereolotography (Laser and DLP systems). 

What sets me apart ?
Since I started working in this field, I noticed suppliers sell us photo-polymer resins with medium quality and delivers only poor properties, furthermore they are quite expensive ! 
So, I decided to developed an affordable high resolution photo-polymer resins for 3D printers by myself.

Keys to success ?
During the last years i developed new photo-polymer resins for 3D printing. 
I would like to use and implement my knowledge and technical skills which i have acquired to develop new materials.
I believe that my enthusiasm and my background would ideally match for this new challenge.

 My accomplishments ?
At this date, I succeeded creating the first photo-polymer resins formulation and the target is to make a resinr everyone.
So, I want to bring in the market an affordable resins with high-resolution and good mechanical properties. 


What exactly are the problems ?

low polymerization speed 
bad accuracy 
significant shrinkage 
medium mechanical properties 
low shelf-life 
high viscosity  
limited color range 


How exactly I will address the problems ?



Raw materials: bibliographic search and selection of raw materials as well resins suppliers.

Polymerization speed : the effect of the photoinitiator concentration and the light intensity on cure depth of a polymerized network can be examined to create a theoretical model.
Accuracy: the measure of linear shrinkage in X and Y will enable us to calculate and integrate a compensation linear coefficient shrinkage during the polymerization.
Shrinkage : a model clarifies the relationship between curing depth, the energy dosage and the photoinitiator concentration on the polymerization process.
Mechanical properties: the mechanical properties will be optimized through the materials characterization measurements.

Viscosity : the formulation will allow us to play with the viscosity diversity between the raw materials

Colors : the dyes integration in the resins will allow us to use a palette of colors.
Shelf-life : addition of different stabilizer and study in extreme conditions of temperature and environment.

3D printer tests : during this campaign, i will set up a resins approval period on 3D printers existing in the market.


What I will be doing and why ?


Resin type : For the time being, i am going to only produce acrylate resins. I personally enjoy printing with acrylate resins for his polymerization characteristics (curing-speed), mechanical properties (tough and flexible) and the post-processing ease (iso-propanol cleaning and short UV post-curing).


Polymerization speed : For this, it is important that the spectral emission profiles of the UV-Visible light curing unit match with the absorption characteristics of the photoinitiator. We will adapt the photoinitiator to the wavelength emitted by UV light source of 3D-printers using Laser & DLP systems. The resins polymerize perfectly at the wavelenghts range used by most of 3D printers and for 25 to 100 µm layers thickness.


Accuracy : To have a good printing accuracy we will work to control the resolution in X, Y and Z axis. Futhermore, on the cure depth during the resin polymerization.


Shrinkage : Our resins will have an optimal deep penetration with the lowest energy to avoid the stress polymerization and reduce the shrinkage of the parts.


Viscosity : From my experience in the 3D printing field, it seems that a good viscosity is less than 700 cPs to avoid losses and problems processing.Therefore, i plan to start with a low viscosity resins around 400 cPs.


Colors : We will be offering a palette of colors. This includes white, gray, blue, red, orange and green resins.


Shelf-life : Our resins will have a long shelf-life and could be guarantee between 6 months and 1 year at normal conditions storage.

What I need & what you get ?
I am asking for €20,000 to help cover some of the cost for equipments, raw materials, laboratory space and subcontracting.
In return, you will get a high-resolution resin at a lower cost.
So, you will be helping us to bring these affordable new materials to the 3D printing community.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our shackles are precision investment cast out of Grade 5 (6Al-4V) titanium. Grade 5 (6Al-4V)  titanium is an aerospace alloy that has a yield strength 3-1/2 times greater than 316 stainless steel, while being 44% lighter. Best of all, it is corrosion free in the natural environment, including saltwater!</span><br/></p>
<p>The common misconception is that since it's made out of titanium, it's going to be expensive. If you look through our <a href=""http://www.alliedtitanium.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, you'll see we are making titanium products affordable. And if you help us crowdfund tooling and production runs, we can really get the cost down. As you can see, the rewards are comparable to 316 stainless steel shackles, even though ours are stronger and lighter.</p>
<p>The 5/16 inch version of this shackle has an amazing breaking strength of greater than 8000 pounds (3628 kg), giving it a safe working load of about 4000 pounds (1814 kg).</p>
<h1>The pin locks in place!</h1>
<p></p>
<p>There is a locking mechanism which is engaged when the pin is tightened into the shackle body. Each click further tightens the lock, negating the need for seizing wire to prevent the pin from becoming accidentally unscrewed.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<i>The ridges on the underside of the head of the pin. With the notches it creates a locking mechanism.<br/></i><p></p>

The Design


The Shackles




Our shackles are precision investment cast out of Grade 5 (6Al-4V) titanium. Grade 5 (6Al-4V)  titanium is an aerospace alloy that has a yield strength 3-1/2 times greater than 316 stainless steel, while being 44% lighter. Best of all, it is corrosion free in the natural environment, including saltwater!
The common misconception is that since it's made out of titanium, it's going to be expensive. If you look through our website, you'll see we are making titanium products affordable. And if you help us crowdfund tooling and production runs, we can really get the cost down. As you can see, the rewards are comparable to 316 stainless steel shackles, even though ours are stronger and lighter.
The 5/16 inch version of this shackle has an amazing breaking strength of greater than 8000 pounds (3628 kg), giving it a safe working load of about 4000 pounds (1814 kg).
The pin locks in place!

There is a locking mechanism which is engaged when the pin is tightened into the shackle body. Each click further tightens the lock, negating the need for seizing wire to prevent the pin from becoming accidentally unscrewed.


The notches on the shackle body. The HS designates that it is High Strength titanium.


The ridges on the underside of the head of the pin. With the notches it creates a locking mechanism.
The pin is captive in the shackle body, reducing the chances of dropping or losing it.  Yet it can be completely unscrewed and removed if necessary.
So where do I use my new shackle?
Heavy load lifting:



An old fashioned tire swing!

Chained wallet:



Backpacking:



No lost keys or thieving pickpockets here!



Climbing (Tree, Rock, Mountain, etc.) - Safer and more reliable than a carabiner.



Marine Rigging:


Many more uses!


Safety cables and construction rigging
Logging
Anchors and moorings for boats
Towing (Boats, Cars, Water skiers, etc.)
Tying down race cars to trailers
On and on. . . so. . . How about:

A Titanium Tug of War!


The other designs
We already have a prototype of the 5/16 inch shackle, and because no ""one size fits all,"" we want to produce larger and smaller sizes, too. As the saying goes, ""The right tool for the job!""

I’ve come up with what I feel is the first workable internet micropayment system that will allow just about anyone with a website the ability to make money from their content, without having to rely on advertising, banner ads, or subscription models.</p>
<p>My name is Geoff Hassing, I’ve been a professional cartoonist for over 20 years now.  And like every cartoonist out there, I’ve been looking for a way to make money from my cartoons on the internet.  I’ve tried every way out there, like the methods mentioned above, without much luck.</p>
<p>But then, as I kept researching the problem, I kept coming back to the one method that seems to hold the most promise, and <em>not just for cartoonists, but for everyone</em>…. <strong>Micropayments</strong>.</p>
<p>For those of you not familiar with micropayments, they’re purchases made on the internet for very small amounts, typically for fractions of a penny up to about $1, but usually average only a few pennies.  For example, paying 3 cents to read a cartoon, or 2 cents to read a newspaper article, that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Various micropayment systems have been tried over the years, but kept failing for two primary reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason is credit card processing fees.  With purchase amounts so small, it cost more for credit card companies to process the purchase than the purchase amount itself. And until it can be made practical for the CC companies, any micropayment system will fail.</p>
<p>The second reason is because of the prevailing attitude that everything on the internet is free, which has forced website owners and content providers to rely heavily on advertising models like Google’s Adsense, commercials before videos, data mining or subscription models to generate revenue.</p>
<p>My micropayment process addresses both of these issues, making it both practical for credit card companies to process the micropayments, while also making it possible to generate income from your content without having to rely on advertising or other annoying revenue generators.</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Why should you even care if I get this patent?  Because I would like to make it possible for everyone to have the ability to make money from their website content, whether you’re a cartoonist, musician, poet, mechanic, blogger, make tutorials, a small town newspaper, a niche’ magazine, or movie maker.  It doesn’t matter, If you have content that has value, this will give you the ability to make money from that content.</p>
<p>Anyhow, since there’s not much room on this page, I’ve created a <a href=""http://micropaymentpatentprocessupdates.blogspot.com/2010/08/process-begins.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Micropayment Patent Process Update</a> blog that gives a more detailed explanation of why I’m doing this and what I want to accomplish, where I’ll post updates on my progress, and the whole process of trying to get a patent. Check it out and see what you think, and if you feel my idea has merit, please contribute what you can to support this project.</p>
<p>I know I’m askng for a lot of money, but the patent process, especially for a complex patent like this is very expensive.  But I promise to spend the money wisely and responsibly in the pursuit of making this a reality that everyone can benifit from.</p>

this compression process is complete, Dryzoo then releases a non-toxic gas into
the machine’s chamber. For the final step, Dryzoo introduces plasma that binds together
to create an unbreakable, liquid-repellent layer. This protective shielding is
1,000 times smaller than a human hair, making it invisible to the human eye.
After the Dryzoo process is complete, your device now contains a protective,

<p></p></div>","The
Dryzoo process creates a protective shielding for any electronic device, using
our nano-technology, making your electronics resistant to liquid damage of any
kind. During the first stage of Dryzoo, your device is placed into a secure machine
that removes all oxygen from the device and from the machine’s chamber. Once
this compression process is complete, Dryzoo then releases a non-toxic gas into
the machine’s chamber. For the final step, Dryzoo introduces plasma that binds together
to create an unbreakable, liquid-repellent layer. This protective shielding is
1,000 times smaller than a human hair, making it invisible to the human eye.
After the Dryzoo process is complete, your device now contains a protective,
liquid-resistant layer, completely shielding your device from any type of
liquid damage.


Dryzoo
is a unique process that protects your devices from damage caused by exposure
to water and other liquids. Because of Dryzoo’s process, the fear of destroying
all of your phone’s valuable data and information is eliminated. With Dryzoo,
you no longer have to buy a new replacement device when your electronics are
exposed to liquid damage, making it the affordable solution in today’s economy.
Dryzoo offers affordable and dependable protection at a substantially lower
cost, making it the superior solution to protecting your electronics. At
Dryzoo, we understand the having your electronics is not only a convenience,
but also a necessity for everyday life. When you mail in your phone to our
Dryzoo headquarters, we offer a 24-hour turn around time, eliminating the
inconvenience of being without your device. We also have developed and manufactured
high quality packaging, protecting your devices when they are shipped back to
you. Our packaging has inserted foam that is customized to the exact size
of your device, making it secure during shipping. Your devices are fully
insured, and also include a tracking number, shrink wrap sealing, and require
your signature upon arrival. 
Dryzoo is an entirely unique process that provides superior
protection to your most valuable electronics. Other processes, such as
self-applying spray coatings, do not compare to the consistency and assurance
found in the Dryzoo process. Spray coatings easily come off and do not
penetrate deep into the device, leaving room for user error and inconsistent
protection. With Dryzoo, you never have to worry about having to re-coat your
device, as the Dryzoo process lasts a lifetime. Only with Dryzoo can you to
completely submerge your device in any sort of liquid, not just water, for long
periods of time. Dryzoo is the superior choice when it comes to protecting your
electronic devices for any type of liquid damage.
