Our mission, through the OGarden, is to create a real positive ecological impact on Earth, while bringing more autonomy to individuals.We decided to work on a solution that could bring us fresh and healthy food for cheaper than the store and as well creating a great and positive impact on Earth. We felt it would be our contribution to the improvement of Earth and humanity.How can we get fresh, healthy, non-gmo vegetables, for cheaper than the store? That was THE question. We looked into other hydroponic solutions, but they only allowed us to grow a few herbs in the kitchen and did not really made a difference in our food expense. Everything we grew was gone in 1 to 2 meals.So we started developing our own system that would make a REAL difference in our plate and food budget, and the OGarden was born. We created a super optimized device that grows up to 90 veggies, fruits, and herbs at the same time for about 5 times less expensive than in grocery store. Sustainable, autonomous, and affordable - welcome to the future of gardening! OGarden is a young company based in Quebec, Canada. It was founded in 2016 after our first highly successful crowdfunding campaign. Lead by the vision of a more beautiful world that is ecologically closer to nature, the OGarden team has worked hard to find an innovative solution. We believe we've found it. Our goal is to bring more autonomy to you and your loved ones.",97.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am 41 years old and I come from the Netherlands. I am a father of 2 girls 16 and 9 and live in<br/>Schiedam.(near Rotterdam)<br/><br/>This software has been like my 3rd child since 2012 when we managed to get the first version finished. The further development and re-coding of this software is very important to me as we are still early stages of the Internet and it's development potential.  <br/><br/>Accessing the Internet with through mobile devices continues to grow year on year reaching  unprecedented levels. One result was the development of the revolutionary software  producing QR Codes, a square black box - resembling a jigsaw which contains many different types of information.<br/><br/>I have developed software that takes the QR code to the next stage of the evolution..  No longer does the QR Code have to be that plain, boring black cube sitting on the page  - often un noticed or  worse yet, ignored.  <br/><br/>The features built into my software allow you to create your own QR Code, not only that, you can brand it as well.  <br/>Version 1 was designed so that you can produce your own QR Code - Place your own logo within it &amp; change the settings to appear 3D and include a background.<br/><br/>Even options to produce the QR Code with both textured and coloured background were not enough to satisfy my desire to make this the No. 1 software in it's field. I will continue to support and enhance the software. Though now it is good, I want to ensure that it is the best.<br/><br/>Major companies are using QR code marketing in their business and the end users, those who are scanning the QR code, experience the ease of reaching specific places on the Internet without typing those tedious long urls and change of misspelling them.<br/><br/> Business's experience the ease and profit from getting the visitor  to the place they want with the minimum of time and fuss. Other benefits are the ease with which they can be used for the delivery of coupons - leading to a suburb ROI on the cost of the software.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/325453/files/20140121004701-3dqrgenpro.jpg?1390495805"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>Mobile users can now send/receive:-</b><br/><br/>SMS, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Goggle Map, Telephone No. etc. etc. Just through scanning the QR Code into their mobile device. In this day and age of immediate action/results  is it any wonder this simple but highly effective little square produces such excellent returns.<br/><br/><br/>Re-coding the software and expanding the features even more, will make this software a one of a kind! I aim to make it the market leader as there isn't software like this out there!<br/><br/>That's also the reason I am here, seeking those who see this bigger picture.<br/>I want to keep the head start we have since there isn't a stand alone version of QR generator software doing what this software does.<br/><br/><br/>Features I would like to add in the re-coded version are :<br/><br/><ul><li>Make it run on a MAC computer</li></ul><ul>
<li>Integrate monitoring, tracking and having dynamic 3D Qr Codes(we have this but it's separate from the software now)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li> Create a web based version<br/>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>Instant WordPress connected so software shows batch 3D QR codes on every page or post created inside your WordPress</li></ul><ul><li>Having it connect with all social network out there using API (youtube, facebook, linkedin and so on....) so that it show content on the fly.</li></ul><ul><li>Be able to Import PSD, PDF and other files inside the background, that way we can export printable business cards, flyers, reports and other marketing materials.</li></ul><ul><li>Adding as many layers into the back or foreground of the QR code as you want.</li></ul><ul><li>Being able to drag the background added like a PDF, Image or any other file or text.</li></ul><ul><li>Adding an instant mobile landing page creator with tab to call,tap to email, tap to sms and more. </li></ul><ul><li>Having different niche templates available that connect straight away with the generated 3D QR Code</li></ul><ul><li>Being able editing text and images and the position inside the complete picture and landing pages through drag and drop.</li></ul><ul><li>Working the security against hacking it and using it for free!(costs a arm and a leg)</li></ul><ul><li>Putting it on disc and create a hard cover box so it can be sold in stores.</li></ul><br/><b>And there will be even more ........ as we are working on re-coding this software.</b><br/><br/>Getting the funds for this can be the difference between finishing last, as others with more money will drive on this concept. Keep your eyes open, you could be seeing these ""awesome"" looking QR Code's in a place near you very soon. <br/><br/>This software has all the potential  to have it picked up by the Major Million-Dollar Companies like: Coca Cola, Pepsi, Mac Donalds, Walmarkt,  and many many more huge brand names.<br/><br/><br/>Examples of major brands using QR Code marketing:<br/><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320891/files/20140121001206-es.jpg?1390291926"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320892/files/20140121001228-cnn-qr-code1.jpg?1390291948"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320895/files/20140121001428-grape_drink.jpg?1390292068"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320897/files/20140121001441-hmreklame.jpg?1390292081"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320898/files/20140121001452-pepsi-qr.jpg?1390292092"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320899/files/20140121001502-japan_puma_ad_qr_code.jpg?1390292102"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320900/files/20140121001521-Japanese_poster_with_QR_codes.jpg?1390292121"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/320901/files/20140121001534-gucci_ad_with_qr_code.jpg?1390292134"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><br/><b>You can be part of this ""3D QR Code Revolution"" as of today!</b><br/><br/>Using QR Codes to get where we want to go on tablets and mobile devices will be a standard in browsing over the mobile Internet! The effectiveness is expected to lead to more companies addopting them within them marketing stratagies.<br/><br/><b>I have put up the 3D QR Code for ""The Voice of Holland"" for a purpose.</b><br/><br/>Last week I noticed the producers of that show used a QR Code on the television with a warning for people to get their mobile devices or tablet ready, after 60 sec there would be a QR Code shown on the TV Screen that they could scan!<br/><br/><br/>These producers are using the ""OLD"" ugly looking QR Code -  this must prove something right? We are not talking about a local TV station barely making it! This is ""The voice of Holland"" who have sold the TV show to almost every country in the world!<br/><br/><br/>Fund my project and have the 3D QR Codes show up around you, replacing the old black and white ones! Seeing them pop up around you must be a hell of a feeling ""knowing"" you participated in making that happen.<br/><br/>In fact.. build your own client base and produce their ""Personalised"" 3D QR Codes giving you a chance at owning your own business!<br/><br/>Be part of this and get stunned by the power of 3D QR Codes Generated under 60 seconds!<br/><br/><br/><b>What do we need?</b><br/><br/>We have set the funding amount at $30.000 to re-code and add the extra features to the software, that will enable enough money left over to be used for a for a decent marketing campaign. <br/><br/>All money raised above our goal, will be used for the same purposes, marketing, research and development! Keeping the 3D QR Generator Pro a strong and healthy product.<br/><br/><br/><b>Why do you need this funding in this small amount of time?</b><br/><br/>To come up with this first version of the software took us almost 2 years. Now we have taken the 3D Generator Pro to the market, we want to continue it's success and to re-code Version 2 in the shortest possible time.<br/><br/>We all know the Internet is a constantly changing medium, sometimes it even gets to fast for itself. Missing out exploiting this ""awesome"" software would be a real loss.<br/><br/><br/><b>What's in it for me?</b><br/><br/>I have thought about that and will be starting with the first one "" EVERYBODY"" will be getting this first version copy of our software, no restrictions full working 3D QR Generator Pro Licensed! Also those copies will be updated for 'FREE"" as long as we are releasing new updates!<br/><br/>The software is already designed so it can run as a ""Whitelabel Version"" the banner inside the software can be altered so there is room for advertising your own company.<br/><br/>This will be the first perk and will be effective for all who participate in funding the release of 3D QR Generator Pro V2!<br/><br/><br/><b>Note! These will be single machine licenses! and run only on windows based machines.</b><br/><br/><br/>What if you do not reach the desired amount?  Then we would take whatever we raised and make the best of it, as we are determined to release that second version as soon as possible!<br/><br/><br/>This software can really make a difference in using the mobile Internet. Making sites using ""our"" 3D QR Codes a much more attractive alternative  for their marketing campaigns.<br/><br/>Reviews we received  from buyer's of our first version speak for themselves, below are a few of them:<br/><br/><ul><li>""This is an wonderful software with excellent features, I've other qr code softwares but none meets this standard, i can use this for my biz as well as offer qr code service to other offline biz's!

I will quickly buy now thanks for great product no more need to ever buy any other qr code product in future as long as it is maintained thanks again off to buy now.""</li></ul><ul><li>""Ok I have to say that the QR Generator pro is fast and easy to work with. It allows to to add a background image and a Logo to the QR Code. It also allows you to use Gradient style coloring to the QR Code.""</li></ul><ul><li>""I have had a chance to test this software and it is very good and you can produce good looking QR codes with various options one of the best options I have seen for QR codes. Simple to use and to change backgrounds and add logos etc for quality QR codes. Best I have seen.""</li></ul><ul><li>""I usually just float around in the background and buy a couple of things if they interest me but this was something that I have been interested in for a while now. I have sold a few QR codes to businesses before and used different methods to make them a little bit more unusual and stand out from the crowd. This would take me slightly longer to do that make the simple black and white ones you normally see. I tried this as I thought the price was just too darn good to refuse and it was backed up with a lifetime update.

I am 41 years old and I come from the Netherlands. I am a father of 2 girls 16 and 9 and live inSchiedam.(near Rotterdam)This software has been like my 3rd child since 2012 when we managed to get the first version finished. The further development and re-coding of this software is very important to me as we are still early stages of the Internet and it's development potential.  Accessing the Internet with through mobile devices continues to grow year on year reaching  unprecedented levels. One result was the development of the revolutionary software  producing QR Codes, a square black box - resembling a jigsaw which contains many different types of information.I have developed software that takes the QR code to the next stage of the evolution..  No longer does the QR Code have to be that plain, boring black cube sitting on the page  - often un noticed or  worse yet, ignored.  The features built into my software allow you to create your own QR Code, not only that, you can brand it as well.  Version 1 was designed so that you can produce your own QR Code - Place your own logo within it & change the settings to appear 3D and include a background.Even options to produce the QR Code with both textured and coloured background were not enough to satisfy my desire to make this the No. 1 software in it's field. I will continue to support and enhance the software. Though now it is good, I want to ensure that it is the best.Major companies are using QR code marketing in their business and the end users, those who are scanning the QR code, experience the ease of reaching specific places on the Internet without typing those tedious long urls and change of misspelling them. Business's experience the ease and profit from getting the visitor  to the place they want with the minimum of time and fuss. Other benefits are the ease with which they can be used for the delivery of coupons - leading to a suburb ROI on the cost of the software.Mobile users can now send/receive:-SMS, Email, Facebook, Twitter, Goggle Map, Telephone No. etc. etc. Just through scanning the QR Code into their mobile device. In this day and age of immediate action/results  is it any wonder this simple but highly effective little square produces such excellent returns.Re-coding the software and expanding the features even more, will make this software a one of a kind! I aim to make it the market leader as there isn't software like this out there!That's also the reason I am here, seeking those who see this bigger picture.I want to keep the head start we have since there isn't a stand alone version of QR generator software doing what this software does.Features I would like to add in the re-coded version are :Make it run on a MAC computer
Integrate monitoring, tracking and having dynamic 3D Qr Codes(we have this but it's separate from the software now)

 Create a web based version

Instant WordPress connected so software shows batch 3D QR codes on every page or post created inside your WordPressHaving it connect with all social network out there using API (youtube, facebook, linkedin and so on....) so that it show content on the fly.Be able to Import PSD, PDF and other files inside the background, that way we can export printable business cards, flyers, reports and other marketing materials.Adding as many layers into the back or foreground of the QR code as you want.Being able to drag the background added like a PDF, Image or any other file or text.Adding an instant mobile landing page creator with tab to call,tap to email, tap to sms and more. Having different niche templates available that connect straight away with the generated 3D QR CodeBeing able editing text and images and the position inside the complete picture and landing pages through drag and drop.Working the security against hacking it and using it for free!(costs a arm and a leg)Putting it on disc and create a hard cover box so it can be sold in stores.And there will be even more ........ as we are working on re-coding this software.Getting the funds for this can be the difference between finishing last, as others with more money will drive on this concept. Keep your eyes open, you could be seeing these ""awesome"" looking QR Code's in a place near you very soon. This software has all the potential  to have it picked up by the Major Million-Dollar Companies like: Coca Cola, Pepsi, Mac Donalds, Walmarkt,  and many many more huge brand names.Examples of major brands using QR Code marketing:You can be part of this ""3D QR Code Revolution"" as of today!Using QR Codes to get where we want to go on tablets and mobile devices will be a standard in browsing over the mobile Internet! The effectiveness is expected to lead to more companies addopting them within them marketing stratagies.I have put up the 3D QR Code for ""The Voice of Holland"" for a purpose.Last week I noticed the producers of that show used a QR Code on the television with a warning for people to get their mobile devices or tablet ready, after 60 sec there would be a QR Code shown on the TV Screen that they could scan!These producers are using the ""OLD"" ugly looking QR Code -  this must prove something right? We are not talking about a local TV station barely making it! This is ""The voice of Holland"" who have sold the TV show to almost every country in the world!Fund my project and have the 3D QR Codes show up around you, replacing the old black and white ones! Seeing them pop up around you must be a hell of a feeling ""knowing"" you participated in making that happen.In fact.. build your own client base and produce their ""Personalised"" 3D QR Codes giving you a chance at owning your own business!Be part of this and get stunned by the power of 3D QR Codes Generated under 60 seconds!What do we need?We have set the funding amount at $30.000 to re-code and add the extra features to the software, that will enable enough money left over to be used for a for a decent marketing campaign. All money raised above our goal, will be used for the same purposes, marketing, research and development! Keeping the 3D QR Generator Pro a strong and healthy product.Why do you need this funding in this small amount of time?To come up with this first version of the software took us almost 2 years. Now we have taken the 3D Generator Pro to the market, we want to continue it's success and to re-code Version 2 in the shortest possible time.We all know the Internet is a constantly changing medium, sometimes it even gets to fast for itself. Missing out exploiting this ""awesome"" software would be a real loss.What's in it for me?I have thought about that and will be starting with the first one "" EVERYBODY"" will be getting this first version copy of our software, no restrictions full working 3D QR Generator Pro Licensed! Also those copies will be updated for 'FREE"" as long as we are releasing new updates!The software is already designed so it can run as a ""Whitelabel Version"" the banner inside the software can be altered so there is room for advertising your own company.This will be the first perk and will be effective for all who participate in funding the release of 3D QR Generator Pro V2!Note! These will be single machine licenses! and run only on windows based machines.What if you do not reach the desired amount?  Then we would take whatever we raised and make the best of it, as we are determined to release that second version as soon as possible!This software can really make a difference in using the mobile Internet. Making sites using ""our"" 3D QR Codes a much more attractive alternative  for their marketing campaigns.Reviews we received  from buyer's of our first version speak for themselves, below are a few of them:""This is an wonderful software with excellent features, I've other qr code softwares but none meets this standard, i can use this for my biz as well as offer qr code service to other offline biz's! This could've easily be priced 5x more!""""Alright guys this software is a must have, i can't lie, if you do anything mobile, or anything in offline marketing, or online marketing, its a must have, it's the future, everyone has these things...""""CMC you are a pain I'm supposed to be NOT buying anything but I saw this on WF and its a little beauty. Thanks for the special price.""""WOW this is a true all in one qr solution now that we can create > redirect at will > and track. So will we have within the tool like individual qr codes or can we create a folder for each site of ours and also create individual folders for each local clients so we can easily manage all codes this would be great please add feature for next update. I will quickly buy now thanks for great product no more need to ever buy any other qr code product in future as long as it is maintained thanks again off to buy now.""""Ok I have to say that the QR Generator pro is fast and easy to work with. It allows to to add a background image and a Logo to the QR Code. It also allows you to use Gradient style coloring to the QR Code.""""I have had a chance to test this software and it is very good and you can produce good looking QR codes with various options one of the best options I have seen for QR codes. Simple to use and to change backgrounds and add logos etc for quality QR codes. Best I have seen.""""I usually just float around in the background and buy a couple of things if they interest me but this was something that I have been interested in for a while now. I have sold a few QR codes to businesses before and used different methods to make them a little bit more unusual and stand out from the crowd. This would take me slightly longer to do that make the simple black and white ones you normally see. I tried this as I thought the price was just too darn good to refuse and it was backed up with a lifetime update. Seriously $14.95 would be spent on a low worse and what I actually can make in the space of a few minutes is unbelievable. The logo and colours make this VERY easy to sell to businesses and it looks so professional. Thanks for this Alex and I certainly am going to play some more with this.""Some 3D QR Code our clients have made:If you cannot help us with funding but can help making this funding request a success, by advertising this fundraiser and getting at least 3 contributers(please use the tools provided by Indiegogo) will get a Full Version of the 3D QR Generator Pro Copy - Licenced Software with all future updates!You will be able to view all our effort regarding this funding request as we will respond inside this request dailly!Let's make this a truly ""winning"" piece of software just because it's ""worth"" it!Alex van EckSchiedam - Netherlands ps.

We'll be shipping LooLoo worldwide! LooLoo cannot mark orders as gifts. This is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. As many of you know, our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. </p><p>We found this handy tool, that can assist you in calculating duties. Remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency: <a href=""http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-a...</a> . For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from GFS Gateway, First Mile, or your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. </p><p>Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker, your order will be processed for final delivery.  </p><h1>Shipping Procedure</h1><p>You will receive a tracking link with your shipping details within 24 hours of your order being shipped. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package. We use a shared post shipping method to have your order delivered at an affordable price. Your order will ship out from our shipping facility in Salt Lake City, UT with a major shipping company or with a tracking link. Your order will be handled by UPS, USPS, RRDonnelley, or DHL up to entry of your country. Once your order enters your country, your order will be handed off to your local post office for final delivery. </p><p>International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time.

LooLoo represents a complete revolution in how toilets are used and ensures a fresh experience with every flush.            LooLoo's patent-pending technology uses multiple infrared sensors that rest on the inside of the toilet. As you sit down, LooLoo senses your body heat and sprays a blend of essential oils onto the water, trapping unwanted scents beneath the surface water.            The LooLoo chemists have worked hard to create a refreshing and effective formula. The goal was to create a formula that was not overpowering and was effective in trapping the odor. The result is a blend that contains proprietary elements, which not only help seal in the odors but also absorb nitrate odors. Fun Fact: the average person poops approximately once a day--about 1 ounce of stool for every 12 pounds of her or his body weight. (Don’t ask how we figured out that math. We’d rather not get into it.)With LooLoo, odors from ALL bathroom guests will be taken care of, which comes in very handy when grandpa refuses to use the “new-fangled” toilet spray in the bathroom at family reunions.   Or, if you’d prefer to use a conventional odor trapping spray, just pick up a germy bottle, stick your hand in a toilet, and struggle with spraying upside down. In many instances, you don’t have that kind of time.              After handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the LooLoo you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of LooLoo. That's why we're offering LooLoo to this awesome community first.   ManufacturingWe have developed our first proprietary citrus essential oil blend with a liquid manufacturer here in Utah. Members of our team have extensive experience with the manufacture and have worked with them for more than 8 years while at a former consumer packaged goods company.  Our Liquid Manufacture FacilityPart of our product is going to be built and assembled in Asia. We have partnered with a fantastic manufacturing facility that has manufactured products for Sony, Philips, and Panasonic, and we are very confident in their capabilities. All that is left is to put in the purchase order for our first production run, which we will do with your support. Thank you! Our Device Manufacturing TeamWe have been eager to bring LooLoo to the world for a long time and we are very close to realizing our dream. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure the formula, size, durability, and reliability are all dialed in before we ship.  Below, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with LooLoo, starting from the first time Taylor experienced the bathroom. We are insanely excited to get LooLoo onto your toilets. Rest assured that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last LooLoo has shipped.Thanks for all of your support!Help Out By Sharing LooLoo With Your Friends! (#LooLoo) Like what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing LooLoo with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page). The more people who know about LooLoo, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make LooLoo a reality. We can't do this without you!       Here at LooLoo, we know we have benefited greatly from the circumstances we were born into and recognize that LooLoo solves first-world problems. We feel passionate about making this world better for not just those who buy LooLoo, but a better place for everyone. To this end, we are donating a percentage of our revenue to solving the problematic sanitary issues in developing countries. The inventor and co-founder of the LooLoo, Taylor, has already spent three months building toilets for schools and villages in rural areas of Uganda. With the passion of our team and the help of our customers, we are excited to help resolve sanitation problems throughout the world. International BackersThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping LooLoo worldwide! LooLoo cannot mark orders as gifts. This is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. As many of you know, our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Kickstarter. We found this handy tool, that can assist you in calculating duties. Remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency: http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-a... . For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from GFS Gateway, First Mile, or your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker, your order will be processed for final delivery.  Shipping ProcedureYou will receive a tracking link with your shipping details within 24 hours of your order being shipped. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package. We use a shared post shipping method to have your order delivered at an affordable price. Your order will ship out from our shipping facility in Salt Lake City, UT with a major shipping company or with a tracking link. Your order will be handled by UPS, USPS, RRDonnelley, or DHL up to entry of your country. Once your order enters your country, your order will be handed off to your local post office for final delivery. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. U.S Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days.Shipping PolicyIf our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, it's the wrong address, or you moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order.

<p><em> </em></p>
<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/> The honest story of how Smart Spot came to me began on a stormy Monday morning. I set off to work, stopped off at a local coffee shop for my coffee, and proceeded into the office. Like always, I started my day by placing my phone on my desk, my keys followed, then I spilled my coffee on my phone!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> So being a product designer, by noon I had a design of a platform on which I could safely set my phone -- so it would not get dunked again! Like always, I emailed my initial design to my favorite critic, my daughter. Her response was not very positive: “Dad all the phone accessories are so over done! There is literally an accessory for everything. Try something else!” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Call me stubborn, but by the end of the day I had machined a prototype of Smart Spot. I personally fell in love with it, but what do I know? So, I showed it to my secretary. She laughed, and said, ""What have you invented today?"" It was time to close out my day -- I had literally done nothing on my to-do list. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Spilling my coffee had turned out to consume my entire day. </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> After a few modifications to Smart Spot, by Friday that week I had in my hand a product I felt was worthy of showing to my biggest critic, my wife. You have to understand that for 26 years of marriage I have been bringing home inventions. Here's how it usually goes: I walk in the door with my prototype in my hand and say, ""Honey, look at this!"" Her normal response is, ""Yea, that’s great, the trash needs to be taken out!"" This time it was different, she set her phone on it and went back to texting. We were sitting at our kitchen counter, and then she moved into the kitchen and took it with her. Moving from there to the patio to enjoy some wine, I noticed she took it with her again. At this point, I still had not got much of a review from her. Joking around I said, ""You know, I have to take that back to work on Monday right?"" She responded, ""You will bring it home Monday night, right?"" --- I guess she likes it after all.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> That next week I made a few more prototypes, and made the decision to send one to my daughter and see what response I would get when she had one in her hand. A few days later her response came in a text message. “Okay, I got your Smart Spot in the mail. I need one for each room in my house and one for my office.” Ha! Now that both my critics have seen the light, the work begins! </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> Colors, material for the face, non skid for the base… these projects always seem so simple in the beginning -- and then everyone has an opinion. It gets overwhelming at times. Staying focused, I made the decision to carry my prototype with me and showed it to as many people as possible. When I ran out of friends, I went to Starbucks and sat at a table near the line of caffeine depleted people. In 45 minutes I had 22 people ask about Smart Spot. Normal response was, ""Hey, that’s very cool! Where can I get one?"" </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> Now I am all in! I ordered mold bases and made a prototype mold. Wow, that sounded so simple, didn’t it? Well, I spent an entire week, plus the weekend making that mold, a sum of 60+ hours. Not kidding, ask my wife, when I get consumed by something not much else in my life gets much attention. Sorry honey, I love you! </strong></p>
<p><strong><br/> Now all this may sound crazy, but I truly love this product! </strong></p>
<p><strong>My goal is simple: get it launched in time for holiday sales. Impossible you might say! Well, if this were a huge company we would still be in meetings discussing designs, colors ….etc. This is NOT a big company, and I am the big cheese, head honcho, and chief. Now with my prototype tool in place I can manufacture a limited number of units and promise delivery for the holidays. </strong></p>

</div></div>","On New Year's
Day 2013, three massive fires ripped through South Africa's largest slum,
Khayelitsha, displacing over 5 000 people. From the smoke and ashes, Lumkani
was born.
Lumkani is a
tech start-up and social enterprise with one vision: to minimize the loss of life and property caused by
fires in slums in South Africa and across the globe. We have engineered the world's first networked heat-detector designed specifically for a slum/informal settlement environment. With your contribution, we will distribute 3 000 of our detectors to some of South Africa's most high fire-risk households. Your funds will make 3 000 informal homes a safer place to live - the positive spill-over effects of this protection on individuals, community and our society, are profound.And this is just the beginning!Your contribution will be a significant step on our journey to be in every fire-risk home in our country, our continent and the WORLD! Slum fires are a global challenge. Below we have included infographics that highlight the scale of this challenge.
Within two weeks of distributing our first
detectors in December 2014, we prevented two dangerous fires from spreading which would have ended
in significant damage to the community. To date we have sold and distributed 1
200 devices to households across Cape Town.

Listen to Thamara Hela's story below. She is a leader of the UT Gardens community in Khayelitsha, the first neighbourhood to buy Lumkani detectors. She reflects on the day a fire broke out in her community which was detected by the Lumkani device.







Fires are a frequent and devastating occurrence
in all informal settlements/slums across the globe. Burgeoning economic centers
cannot accommodate the rate of influx of people, resulting in rapid
densification of informal settlements. Slum fires spread as a result of:

The density of households
The use of high fire-risk cooking, lighting and heating methods
Flammable materials with which homes are built



The combination of these factors enable shack fires to spread rapidly - easily destroying hundreds of homes and displacing thousands of people in a single blaze. Watch the changing infographics below that paint a picture of the scale of the challenge.



IN SOUTH AFRICA:





Our detectors have been designed specifically for a slum/informal settlement environment. Given the smoke produced by cooking, lighting and heating in these areas, we use the rate-of-rise of temperature to detect fire and NOT smoke.



To address the speed at which fires spread in densely populated communities, our detectors are all connected through radio frequency (RF). When a fire starts in a home, the fire detector will ring alerting the family to the presence of the fire so they can contain it before it becomes unmanageable.




Within 20 seconds, the detector will trigger all devices within the community up to a 60-metre radius from the fire. This creates a community-wide alert to the spread of fires.







We have taken our system a step further...



 We have developed a smart device which integrates with the mesh network of in-home fire detectors. This device sends text messages to community members with the location of the fire. Simultaneously, it stores GPS coordinates of the fire which we will send to the fire department in future, giving them accurate location information of fires in real-time. This information will enable fire personnel to be more proactive in dealing with disasters to mitigate societal risk and costs.


Through swift, networked early-warning we can make a significant impact on the number of spreading fires in the world's poorest communities.





                           We are raising $45 000, which we will use to distribute 3 000 fire detectors to households across South Africa. Your contribution will go towards:
Manufacturing the fire detector
Getting each fire detector to 3 000 households
End-user education & training to maximize the benefits of the system
Installation and maintenance of the smart device (which covers 100 homes) in selected communities
Operational costs of making this happen
If we exceed our target, we will use the extra funds to get more detectors to more households, increasing the impact we hope to make. If we don't reach our target, we will use all of the contributions to get as many detectors as possible to our communities in South Africa.

<b>THE ILLUMINATOR</b><br/><br/> Terminates Pesky Shadows and Places Light where you need it when you need it.<br/>The Illuminator is an all-purpose, LED work lamp created by ALuminary. This light destroys pesky shadows that intrude upon whatever work you may be doing. Metal work, electronic assembly, woodwork, automotive maintenance, gun cleaning and reloading, sewing, arts and crafts, and reading are all subject to being invaded by shadows that harsh lights tend to cast. The Illuminator obliterates shadows to the largest degree, so that you don’t even notice their presence. Typical task lights, and work lights can get in the way, create nasty glare, or create large shadows that force you to constantly be moving the light, or get so hot that they burn you when you bump into them. The Illuminator uses LEDs that will never get hot, no matter how long you leave them on, and the light head is crafted of fine materials that are easy on the hands and the eyes. The modern design makes The Illuminator versatile in function and appearance. The Illuminator is lightweight and collapsible for easy relocation and travel. It can fit anywhere in your shop or home, and it’s infinitely adjustable for your convenience. Kick those irritating shadows out of your workspace for good with The Illuminator!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/905038/files/20141004232708-ILLUMINATOR_COLLAGE.jpg?1412490428"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<b>Value of Your Contribution</b><br/><br/>Your contribution means absolutely everything to us. Your contribution translates directly to you helping to save our lives.

His resume is impressive, but he cannot find work. Without a steady income for such a long period of time the situation has become very urgent. Having no insurance or ability to obtain insurance, Edi has begun to run out of insulin that he needs to survive, and other medications that he was placed on as of 2010. No medicine, no home, no workshop, no food. This project needs to be successful, as soon as possible.<br/><br/><b>PHILOSOPHY</b><br/><br/>The Murway family philosophy, and by relation, the ALuminary philosophy is to be loyal to the customer, as well as devotion to the creation of a reliable, durable, and quality final product.<br/><br/><br/><b>Risks and Challenges</b><br/><br/>Our risks and challenges are relative to time. We don’t have much time left before we lose our home and workshop, and we cannot afford marketing today. However, we have a product that has been through R&amp;D, and beta testing. We have developed our design process, our vendor list, and our bill of materials. We have the facility, machines, and tooling that we need to create the product, but nobody knows we exist! All developmental challenges have been confronted. We just need time, and professional help with marketing. That’s where you come in! As we approach our goal, every risk and challenge we face becomes smaller.<br/><br/><br/><b>Ways You Can Help</b><br/><br/>Our needs are simply stated. Nobody knows who we are! We need professional help with marketing. For those who wish to purchase, or even those who cannot purchase, but are interested in our designs, we would love to hear your opinions. We love to hear feedback from you! Furthermore, liking and sharing on social media is a HUGE help! Getting the word out on Facebook and Twitter makes an enormous difference! So please, get the word out, tell your friends, send us messages!

        The reusable coffee capsule DELTA from mycoffeestar.com is made of stainless steel. You can refill this capsule as many times you want. You can save a lot of money by that and do something good for the environment. You don‘t produce any waste like you do with the aluminium capsules from Nespresso®. The capsule is healthy because no aluminium particles will get into your body.

<p>
        Three years ago, we developed the first reusable coffee capsule ALPHA made of medical stainless steel. We wanted to provide an alternative to the disposable capsules. Then, Nespresso® changed some machine parts in response to the increasing number of competitors. So we made the BETA capsule that fits for these new models of Nespresso® machines as well. In October 2013, the capsule became eco-champion in Germany! That was of course very encouraging and reassuring! But there were still tow limiting factors: the high shipping costs and ecological concerns. For many interested people from all over the world the shipping is too expensive and shipping a parcel from Switzerland to people in Europe and overseas is not very ecologic either.  
Beginning of 2014, we started working on a “technical” solution for these two problems and redesigned the capsule to get it shipped less costly and more eco-friendly. The result is the new capsule DELTA, made of stainless steel in three parts instead of two in order to fit it in a small envelope only 19mm high! This new design required a different production method (drilled with CNC instead of moulding with MIM) which makes the capsule more expensive but shipping costs are now five times cheaper!

For many interested people from all over the world the shipping is too expensive and shipping a parcel from Switzerland to people in Europe and overseas is not very ecologic either.  
Beginning of 2014, we started working on a “technical” solution for these two problems and redesigned the capsule to get it shipped less costly and more eco-friendly. The result is the new capsule DELTA, made of stainless steel in three parts instead of two in order to fit it in a small envelope only 19mm high! This new design required a different production method (drilled with CNC instead of moulding with MIM) which makes the capsule more expensive but shipping costs are now five times cheaper!
        






Alpha capsule

            The ALPHA capsule was the first one we developed 2 years ago. The capsule became ecotest winner in germany in october 2013
            








Beta Capsule

            After Nespresso® made some changes to the machines we developed our second capsule BETA that fits into the new machines.

Investment into our new project 

        One of our biggest concerns for the future is drinking water supplies. More than 700 million people on this planet do not have access to clean drinking water, most of them living in so called developing countries. Already now, we are working on an affordable water filter and we will invest 30% of the gains from this crowd funding campaign into this new project. The more people participate in this campaign, the more we can invest in the water filter project!
        







Help us spreading the message! 

        A lot of people are not aware of the ecological problem they are contributing to by using disposable coffee capsules. Only a few know that they ingest aluminium and plastic particles with every coffee from disposable capsules. Please, forward this link as well to your friends and people who are using a Nespresso® machine. With your help this message will make its way around the world! Thank you for your interest and please, feel free to contact us with your questions and ideas.

<div>We are working with Elephant Thoughts who started out with a mission to set up schools which they soon learned to transform into community hubs. <span>STRAND, with your help, hopes to contribute to Elephant Thought's sustainable communities by replacing their kerosene lamps and stoves with our Solar Charging Kits that run a low-power LED lighting system and an Enviro-Fit clean burning stove. As an added bonus, our Solar Charging Kits will also charge smart phones, generating much needed income that can double their quality of life.<p></p>

<li>Kerosene lamps produce inferior light (typically 2 lumens as compared to 90 lumens in a typical 60 watt bulb), creates black carbon which is 270 times worse then CO2 and dramatically affects health (especially for women who need to cook meals and children who need to study). </li>
<li>There are 780 Million women &amp; children still today who rely on kerosene lamps, and 4.3 million deaths reported from the effects of inhaling kerosene. </li>

     TWO Like Minded Partners, ONE Great Cause!  









We are working with Elephant Thoughts who started out with a mission to set up schools which they soon learned to transform into community hubs. STRAND, with your help, hopes to contribute to Elephant Thought's sustainable communities by replacing their kerosene lamps and stoves with our Solar Charging Kits that run a low-power LED lighting system and an Enviro-Fit clean burning stove. As an added bonus, our Solar Charging Kits will also charge smart phones, generating much needed income that can double their quality of life.
                                         
                                         

 


The Negative Impact of Kerosene Lamps Around   The World & Our Planet: 










Kerosene lamps produce inferior light (typically 2 lumens as compared to 90 lumens in a typical 60 watt bulb), creates black carbon which is 270 times worse then CO2 and dramatically affects health (especially for women who need to cook meals and children who need to study). 
There are 780 Million women & children still today who rely on kerosene lamps, and 4.3 million deaths reported from the effects of inhaling kerosene. 
Just having 4 hours of exposure to kerosene lamps is equivalent to smoking 2 packs of cigarettes. 




     
DID YOU KNOW THAT ELIMINATING KEROSENE WOULD REMOVE 58% OF                              CO2 EMISSIONS FROM RESIDENTIAL LIGHTING?







Who We Are?






We are Strand Energy Corporation as social entrepreneurs who specializes in the sales and service of solar power systems and other renewable sources (wind+solar). 




No matter what side of the climate change science argument you agree with, STRAND Energy believes it is always prudent to look after our planet and we have made renewable sources of energy our business. Our Mission is to bring affordable, clean energy to the world- one home at a time and in a manner that is responsible, sustainable and
affordable. In honour of the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference and the world religious Festivals, including
our own allegiance to Christmas, we feel it is important  to give back to the people of OUR WORLD.

The Impact
Allie and Paul have been living in renovations for four years and the news just keeps getting worse in their house.  The impact of your help is indescribable.  It gives them a future:

Allie gives a trememndous amount to her community and friends.  She is running out of energy from living in a home that is not a home.  She needs your help.
So many people have asked how they can help, and so a community build will occur, however, without money for materials there can be no community build.
This campaign will give them the ability to move forward, renting out their apartment again and being able to focus on smaller projects in the house.
Due to Paul's back injury, he cannot work and now has to re-train in a new field.  Living on one self-employed income is straining them and they have no extra for renovations.



Other Ways You Can Help
If money is not your contribution, please spread the word about the campaign and let us know if you would like to be involved in the build.
A Note from Allie's friends, Sarah, Lisa and Sandra:


This campaign: If you are visiting this site, you’ve likely heard through the grapevine that Allie and Paul need some help. Friends are initiating a fundraising campaign to help them get their house into a livable state and their rental apartment to a rentable level again. Until recently, many of us were not aware of the stress these two have been under. It has become clear to a few of us that their living situation is very difficult, and we no longer want either of them to be living like this. 
The situation: It’s been over 5 years of working to re-build a home that should not have been sold as ‘safe’ or ‘livable’. When Allie bought her house on Duncan St., like most prudent homeowners she had a an inspection done. Little did she know that that the house was unsafe and unfortunately the inspector did not bring this to her attention either. The beams supporting both the first -and second floors were inadequately supported,there were major problems with defective roofing, and faults in the foundation have led to a basement full of water (you can actually see through the foundation to the backyard viaa hole in the basement wall). Most of these very serious problems were not revealed until Paul (Allie’s partner and a carpenter) started some simple home improvements. 
After four years of trying to do damage control, and living in a house virtually crumbling around them, Allie and Paul are exhausted. They have run out of energy and money. For those of you who are devotees of Allie’s healing yoga practice you know that she is self-employed and Paul has recently had a setback and has had to stop his carpentry work due to a very serious recurring back injury.
Please take a look at the video above and you’ll get a personal sense of what this terrible situation has done to these very good people. You can see for yourself that the sale of this home involved a very bad bill of goods. Many of us are concerned that they are not living in a safe situation. Even more so, we are concerned about their health. 
As many of you know Allie and Paul are not those who would call out to ask for help. They have been struggling with this in relative silence. When a few of us noticed that this situation was sliding from bad to worse, we decided to start this campaign. 
The Goal: We are launching a 60 day fundraising campaign to try and raise $ 5, 000 before the end of the summer to help Allie and Paul get the disaster zone they call home into a safe, dry and sound place to live before the snow flies. 
What can you do? At the moment what is needed most is to collect enough money for Allie and Paul to buy the materials to do basic repairs.

</div></div>","The Kodiak Solar Generator System is composed of 2 major components: the Kodiak Solar Generator , and the Solar Storm 135 GL solar panels. The solar panels collect solar energy and the Kodiak Solar Generator stores that power inside a lithium-ion battery bank.  


 


 

 





The Kodiak can be charged 3 different ways: via solar panels, wall charger, or even a car charger.

 

Below are some of the many tools and devices the Kodiak powers:
 

 
The Kodiak is the world’s first solar generator that expands to fit your needs without requiring you to purchase another entire system. It’s simple – if you want more battery storage, just connect deep cycle batteries to the external battery connection on the side of the Kodiak. Any connected batteries will charge and discharge at the same rate as the internal batteries. Thus acting as one fully-integrated system.

Each Solar Storm 135 GL panel has an extra connection on the back enabling additional panels to be connected.  Connect up to 4 panels to minimize the charge time for your off-grid system.

 
Your Kodiak System purchase may save you over $300 off of your federal income tax!  When purchased with the Predator 50 Panels, your Kodiak System may qualify you for the Federal Residential Energy Tax Credit. Please consult your tax professional.
 

 
- There are 10x more major power outages now than there were in the 80's & 90's.

Evaporative coolers already exist but you may have never heard about them - they are all very bulky and if your hot season is short they are not presented on your market at all. But Evapolar is not just another evaporative cooler. It received a number of upgrades that make it truly unique. And the main one is that we managed to make it both powerful and compact so you could put it on your table.</p><p>You ask why do we call Evapolar an air conditioner while such devices are more known as air coolers? Well, the common opinion is that small air coolers are absolutely inefficient in general and almost useless when humidity is more than 55%-60%. Actually, this is true for all of them except Evapolar. In Evapolar we utilize the most advanced cooling technology taking literally 100% of what laws of physics allows us. So Evapolar has a really impressive cooling effect for a personal device of this size. So, we prefer to call it an evaporative air conditioner.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b style=""font-size: 16px;"">1. How does Evapolar work?</b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Evapolar is a portable personal device which not only chills but also humidifies and purifies the air around you. The working principle is very simple: you need to fill the removable water tank and plug Evapolar in. Within 2-3 minutes Evapolar cartridge absorbs a huge amount of water. The water then spreads evenly on the surface of the cooling pads. When the air goes through the pads, the water evaporates, which makes the air cool down while getting saturated with water. The in-built fan helps the cool air spread on the area of 3-4 sq m around you. The power control enables you to adjust the cooling effect, creating most comfortable thermal conditions for you.</p>
<p><b>2) What is the difference between Evapolar and other cooling devices?</b></p>
<p>Evapolar surpasses other cooling devices in many aspects. First of all, Evapolar is a personal device. It can help you create the most comfortable microclimate without invading the personal space of the people around you. Secondly, we call Evapolar “air conditioner” rather than “air cooler” due to its efficiency in comparison with “traditional” conditioners. Evapolar remains within the range of low-price tabletop devices, does not require any costs on installation and maintenance, and is ready to use right out of the box. Thirdly, Evapolar cools the air by evaporating water, which makes the device an efficient humidifier. You won’t have to buy a separate conditioner, humidifier, or purifier. Our technologies allow combining the three functions in one device. This is how it creates a so-called “personal microclimate”. The last but not the least, Evapolar consumes 100 times less power than standard split systems – only 10W – which will clearly have a positive effect on your electricity bills.</p>
<p><b>3. What does the cooling degree depend on?</b></p>
<p>The cooling degree depends on three factors: the outside air temperature, air humidity, and the power of the device that you choose yourself. The working principle of Evapolar is based on evaporation process. The higher the temperature and the lower the humidity is, the more actively the evaporation happens, and therefore the cooling effect is stronger.</p>
<p>The last factor that influences the temperature change is the power of the device. By adjusting it, you can choose the most comfortable thermal conditions for you.</p>
<p><b>4. How much does Evapolar reduce the temperature and what area can it cool down?</b></p>
<p>The maximum temperature drop is 15C. It is worth mentioning that the change in temperature depends on external conditions and the device power. In regions of high humidity the difference may be 5 degrees, in dry and hot ones it may get up to 15C. We have tested the device all over the world and came to the conclusion that the comfortable temperature drop in people’s perception and in reality is different. Your body will always be the best indicator, since its needs vary just as dramatically depending on the native climate and current season. Classic conditioners do not take this fact into account. Singapore may be a vivid example: you can achieve necessary comfort there with the temperature loss of 5C, and the one of 10C is already unpleasant for your skin.</p>
<p>The cooling zone of Evapolar is 3-4 sq m. Evapolar is a personal device developed specifically for small areas. It will help you create most comfortable conditions at your workplace or recreational space. </p>
<p><b>5. How much noise does Evapolar make?</b></p>
<p>Evapolar is no louder than the cooling fan of your computer! The noise level depends on the power you set yourself. The normal noise level is 28-35 dB.</p>
<p><b>6. What do you mean by “eco-friendliness” of the device?</b></p>
<p>We care about your health as well as the health of our planet. The evaporative materials used in the device consist of completely organic-free fibers. It makes Evapolar different from conventional air conditioners that have evaporative pads and filters made of cellulose, a nutritional environment for microorganisms. Due to its materials, after half a year in the ground Evapolar will fully degrade without any harm to nature. The second important thing is that we do not use any chemically aggressive liquids, which can damage one’s health, for cooling. And finally, Evapolar consumes only 10W, which equals to the power of a simple light bulb. In this day and age, energy saving not only has economic benefits, but also enables us to reduce consumption of natural resources as well as emission of harmful substances into the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>7. Does Evapolar work without power supply?</b></p>
<p>While using Evapolar, it should be plugged into the power supply. But it doesn’t have to be a power socket. You can plug Evapolar into a power bank, usb-port of your car or laptop, a solar battery. The only condition is that the power supply must have the output of 5V and 2A.</p>
<p><b>8. How do I know it’s time to replace the cartridge? Do I need to buy an extra cartridge right now?</b></p>
<p>You need to replace the cartridge every 8-12 months provided that you constantly use it during that period. At the moment there is no indication system which notifies you that the cartridge has expired. If you use clean water and wipe the working camera of the device from time to time, its lifecycle can be significantly increased.</p>
<p><b>9. Does Evapolar need extra installation and maintenance? What should I do if it is out of order?</b></p>
<p>Evapolar is very easy to use and ready to work right out of the box. All you need to do is fill the water tank and plug in the device. The water tank needs to be refilled every 6-8 hours as the water evaporates. You can find more detailed rules on Evapolar usage in the manual attached. All in all, it is only important to keep the device from turning over and wipe the working camera once a month.</p>
<p>In case of a breakdown you need to contact our support service <a href=""mailto:support@evapolar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@evapolar.com</a> or your local distributor (if you bought the device not on our website).</p>
<p>Evapolar warranty is 1 year.</p>
<p>If your Evapolar requires to be repaired you need ship the unit to us or to your local distributor if any available. In case the defect is covered by warranty your shipping costs will be refunded.</p>
<p><b>10. Where can I find more detailed information about the product, its developers, and the project itself?</b></p>
<p>Our project is quite young and began its way on a crowd funding platform Indiegogo, where we were supported by thousands of people.

Create your personal microclimate and enjoy ultimate comfort exactly when you need it and where you need it!Evapolar works on power of water evaporation — the simplest and most efficient cooling technology since ancient times. Evaporative coolers already exist but you may have never heard about them - they are all very bulky and if your hot season is short they are not presented on your market at all. But Evapolar is not just another evaporative cooler. It received a number of upgrades that make it truly unique. And the main one is that we managed to make it both powerful and compact so you could put it on your table.You ask why do we call Evapolar an air conditioner while such devices are more known as air coolers? Well, the common opinion is that small air coolers are absolutely inefficient in general and almost useless when humidity is more than 55%-60%. Actually, this is true for all of them except Evapolar. In Evapolar we utilize the most advanced cooling technology taking literally 100% of what laws of physics allows us. So Evapolar has a really impressive cooling effect for a personal device of this size. So, we prefer to call it an evaporative air conditioner. That is why.   With the help of our early backers we've managed to make Evapolar a reality. It was a hard but exciting journey and now Evapolar's manufacturing facilities are all set up and running. We are fulfilling new orders in 7 days. We will send you a survey to specify your desired color, plug type and any additional information that might help us to prepare your order in a speedy way. Evapolar allows you to create your own personal climate. Now you can adjust temperature to your needs, not the needs of everyone using one shared air cooler. This is a real revolution in air cooling! Evaporative cooling technology is very energy efficient itself.However we managed to improve it even more.

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.findercodes.com/images/indiegogo/indiegogo-slide1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>FinderCodes is a simple yet revolutionary lost and found system created for today’s hectic lifestyles. We’re a society that’s truly on the “gogo,” so it’s all too easy to lose track of the things we value most—from our smartphones, to sports equipment, to our beloved pets. </p>
<p>Too often those things we love the most are gone for good. Lack of identification tags, outdated tags, and dead batteries on phones make it practically impossible for even the most determined of Good Samaritans out there to return a found item.</p>
<p><strong>And that’s the thing. Most people, like you, <em>are</em> Good Samaritans and will gladly return a lost item, especially if it’s easy to do so.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.findercodes.com/images/indiegogo/indiegogo-slide2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; padding: 0 12px 12px 0;""/></p>
<p>That’s where FinderCodes comes in. Using powerful, QR-encoded smart identification tags that will attach to almost anything, FinderCodes enable that Good Samaritan finder of your lost item to quickly, easily, and—get this—<em>anonymously</em> connect with you. </p>
<p>So now imagine that sinking, lost-forever feeling interrupted when you hear your phone chime. It's an alert from FinderCodes that your item has been found, and it even shows you its location on a map! The wheels are set in motion for a safe and easy return. How cool is that?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How it Works</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.findercodes.com/Content/themes/responsive/images/hpLost123.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The finder simply scans the tag with a smartphone,</strong> or enters its code online, triggering an instant alert to the owner that the item has been found, even locating it on a map.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Meanwhile, the finder is shown important and compelling information from the owner,</strong> such as a reward amount or in the case of a pet, emergency medical information. (Think of it as a med-alert bracelet for your four-legged family member.)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The finder can then contact the owner with the simple tap of a button.</strong> Around the corner? Meet in person. Across the country? The finder can bring your item to FedEx Office® and have it shipped home to you, using our exclusive Re-Turnit™ shipping service we created in alliance with FedEx®. Doesn’t get much easier than that!</li>
</ol>

<p> </p></span></div>","Who We Are
FinderCodes is a simple yet revolutionary lost and found system created for today’s hectic lifestyles. We’re a society that’s truly on the “gogo,” so it’s all too easy to lose track of the things we value most—from our smartphones, to sports equipment, to our beloved pets. 
Too often those things we love the most are gone for good. Lack of identification tags, outdated tags, and dead batteries on phones make it practically impossible for even the most determined of Good Samaritans out there to return a found item.
And that’s the thing. Most people, like you, are Good Samaritans and will gladly return a lost item, especially if it’s easy to do so.

That’s where FinderCodes comes in. Using powerful, QR-encoded smart identification tags that will attach to almost anything, FinderCodes enable that Good Samaritan finder of your lost item to quickly, easily, and—get this—anonymously connect with you. 
So now imagine that sinking, lost-forever feeling interrupted when you hear your phone chime. It's an alert from FinderCodes that your item has been found, and it even shows you its location on a map! The wheels are set in motion for a safe and easy return. How cool is that?
 
 
How it Works



The finder simply scans the tag with a smartphone, or enters its code online, triggering an instant alert to the owner that the item has been found, even locating it on a map.


Meanwhile, the finder is shown important and compelling information from the owner, such as a reward amount or in the case of a pet, emergency medical information. (Think of it as a med-alert bracelet for your four-legged family member.)


The finder can then contact the owner with the simple tap of a button. Around the corner? Meet in person. Across the country? The finder can bring your item to FedEx Office® and have it shipped home to you, using our exclusive Re-Turnit™ shipping service we created in alliance with FedEx®. Doesn’t get much easier than that!

 
 
What makes our Smart Tags smart for you?



Guard against identity theft — User identities are protected when communicating with one another.

Instant loss alert messages sent to owner — immediately when the tag is scanned. The alert may even include a map of the item's location.

Built-in GPS feature — makes return logistics a snap!

Smart Tags are evergreen — Unlike regular ID tags, these never become obsolete, even if you move or change phone numbers.

Lost items shipped home automatically —via FedEx Office®, using our exclusive Re-Turnit™ system.

No annual subscription fees — 'nuf said.

System works with any smartphone or computer — an internet connection is all that's needed.


Rewards to a finder via PayPal® — can be paid in a few easy clicks right from our free app.

Personal Asset Management tool — Your insurance agent may start salivating at this one.

Provides peace of mind — knowing your item has the best chance on earth of being returned.

</div>","The Side Scoop!

We know you absolutely love your cat or kitten but you undeniably despise scooping the litter box, but unfortunately it comes along with caring for your little furry friend.Problems:


You know it’s a job you have to do but it needs to be a bit easier and more sanitary.


Having to scoop too close to the poop is dirty and unpleasant.


As far as ease, most scoops are not designed to go easy on your back, wrists and shoulders.


And what about those of you who may need to sit and scoop or who may be in wheelchairs? There should be a way you don’t have to bend over too far and push the scoop out in front of you, away from your seat.

Solution:


A better scoop…a great new cat litter scoop coming to the market.


Be a part of its history and be one of the first to own one from its first-run manufacturing pre-sale - here.

What is it?

It’s called The Side Scoop and it is a long-handle scoop, with walls, that scoops and sifts cat litter sideways like a ladle, instead of front ways like a shovel. It is the first of its kind.


Benefits:


The longer handle allows for ergonomic handling, which is better on the back, wrists and shoulders.


The sideways scooping motion makes it less likely to over-scoop litter out of the box, because it scoops sideways like a ladle, instead of front ways like a shovel.


Sideways scooping is a more natural movement direction. Think about it. We use eating utensils, toothbrushes, combs/brushes, brooms, pencils, etc. in similar positions with sideways motions.


The walls and slightly dipped bottom prevents scooped waste from falling back into the box; flat shovel-like scoops with no walls are like trying to balance a ball on a paddle. Ever try that?


The scoop also has slits on the floor and walls for easy sifting, and the scoop design makes it easier to discard waste with a sideways dumping motion, which cuts down on dust. 


The scoop can also be used to scrape and clean around the inside of the box.


Definitely a better scoop for everybody – adults, children, seniors, people who need to sit – everybody!


The scoop will be available in both right-handed and left-handed versions because we all love our cats!


The scoop will be available in four colors: periwinkle blue, ivory white, hunter green and black.


The scoop is light-weight but durable.

We Need Your Help!

We have the prototype and now we need to raise the funding for the first manufacturing run, which includes packaging, shipping and distribution.This is where you come in, because we cannot do this with YOU.




Realistically, we want to raise $15,000-$20,000 for the first run. We believe in this product that much because we know there are so many cat lovers out there who will appreciate a better way to keep their cat or cats (for super cat lovers) litter box cleaner.


We need to raise enough funds to cover the costs of your perks, Indiegogo and Credit Card Processor fees, manufacturing, packaging, shipping and handling.


We set the goal lower because we are able to use whatever amount you, the backers, fund us. Our first run production will be on a small, medium or large scale, depending on how you choose to fund this project. So, we are counting on you!

PERKS!
For your backing, you receive these great perks.
First of all, you will be one of the first to receive your very own pre-sale Side Scoop and be part of the history of launching this unique, new product into the market!

<h3>House fire destroys family's home</h3>
<p>Our neighbour's townhouse in Mississauga Ontario was gutted by a fire on the morning of Saturday, October 12th.  The father suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns.  The fire destroyed their home and most of their belongings, and they will not be able to move back in due to the extent of the damage caused by the fire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a neighbour living in the same complex, I wanted to try to do something to help them, so I've set up this campaign in the hope that people will come together to pitch in whatever they can to help the Moyles family recover from the fire.</p>
<p>All donations will go to a trust fund that has been set up for them.</p>

Our current estimated delivery is September '18 for 110V Units, and October '18 for 220V units.ARE YOU SOMEONE WHO LOVES EATING DELICIOUS MEALS? How often has a lack of time (or even experience) gotten in the way of making your own? Making high-quality food at home is tedious… and eating out gets expensive fast!Wouldn’t it be amazing if you could come home to perfectly cooked meals like tender pesto chicken, juicy duck breast, asparagus, cheesecake, perfect crème brûlée and hundreds more…?  Sous Vide Cooking That Adapts To YouChefs around the world trust the sous vide cooking method, known for it’s ability to cook food perfectly to your desired doneness, with no risk of under- or over-cooking.The Nise Wave takes sous vide a step further. It is the ONLY sous vide cooker that lets you have your meal not only how you want, but exactly when you wantImagine - leaving the house for hours, knowing your meal will be taken care of, cooked to be ready when you want it.While you are away, the patented adaptive temperature system automatically controls the cooking process. It creates a unique temperature curve for the recipe you select in the Nise mobile app, based on your desired doneness, ideal tenderness, and exactly when you want your food to finish cooking.    The Nise Ecosystem combines the tech of silicon valley and the precision of sous-vide cooking.       Food is put into any food-grade bag and placed into a pot of water. Then the Nise Wave circulates and heats water to a precise temperature, which is defined by your chosen doneness. For example: a medium-rare steak needs to heat to 135°F; for a chicken breast to be juicy and tender it needs to reach 144°F.  Over time, your food will be perfectly cooked from edge-to-edge, and will never be over- or under- cooked. Sous Vide Fact: Starbucks has added sous vide eggs and steaks to their menus. 
Cooking with the Adaptive Temperature System (ATS)

Traditional sous vide cooking heats to one precise temperature to optimize for one variable, doneness. 
Since the patented ATS heats to different temperatures throughout the cooking cycle, it can control for multiple variables, including doneness, tenderness and scheduled finish time while maintaining protein quality. (Patent - PCT/CN2016/075744) 
Would you like more information on how the ATS works or the science behind it? Please visit the FAQ section
Clarification - The ATS is optional. You can still use the Wave to cook sous vide the traditional way.


We didn’t just want to create a great ecosystem, but also a great physical product.

 
We set out to create a product that doesn’t compromise on what matters to sous vide enthusiasts ... at the price point of an entry level sous vide solution.
 

 
How We Stack Up Against The Competition
Information sourced from respective company websites
 
1200W of Power in a Compact Size
Higher power means you can heat larger pots of water very quickly, and easily maintain the temperature to pin-point precision.    
 

Bonus - This combined with our recommended maximum volume of 10 Gallons (38L) means you can cook at least 15 regular sized meals simultaneously or a large rack of lamb!
 

 
Control The Way You Want To Cook - WiFi Or Manual
While the Wave’s WiFi control is simple and intuitive, we appreciate that sometimes you want to physically control your sous-vide. 
 

Clarification - WiFi doesn't mean your phone and the Wave need to be on the same WiFi. As long as the Wave is connected to your home wireless network, you can control it from anywhere. 
 

Bonus - Our display screen shows target temperature, current temperature, and remaining time all at a glance. (Also we're Canadian so we had to add in the option to switch to °C)    
 

 
 
Water-Resistance Because Accidents Happen
 
Water-Resistance to IP67 specifications means, you can comfortably rinse your Wave or submerge it for 30 minutes without fear of failure. 
 

Bonus - Because more of the product is submersible, the Wave has a larger effective cooking area than much bigger sous-vide cookers.

<h4 align=""left"">Hi, my name is Michael Coates, from Melbourne Australia, and with my two sons, Chase and Blaine, we have designed a smarter, safer product for the health and fitness industry. </h4>
<h4 align=""left"">Introducing DUMBAGS: a sand-filled, material-based alternative to the common dumbbells and kettlebells used in weight and personal training.</h4>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Smart weights</span></h3>
<p>In simple terms, Dumbags are sandbags of various sizes and weights, purpose-designed for the fitness and personal training industry. </p>
<p>Dumbbells and Kettlebells are great, and have helped millions of people get in to shape, however in many circumstances there can be serious problems associated with their use. That's why we created Dumbags - to solve the many problems associated with metal bells, particularly personal injury and property damage. Kettlebells and dumbbells are great and have their place, its just that Dumbags are better! Why? See our 9 main reasons below:</p>
<p><img alt=""The safest weights ever"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/956743/pictures/original/20130730030440-dumbag_dumbell_broken_tile_crop_2.jpg?1375178680"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> -      <strong>Personal Safety</strong>: Dumbags' soft design means dropping or banging a weight on any part of your body will not cause serious injury.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Less Noise</strong>: Because they are filled with sand, our weights won't make a huge amount of noise when dropped.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Avoid Property Damage</strong>: Unlike dropping a metal weight, dropping a Dumbag on a timber or tiled floor will not damage the surface - meaning you can work out wherever you want.</p>
<p>-       <strong>More Options</strong>: Their flexible design allows you to hold more than one Dumbag at a time - rather than just one kettlebell or dumbbell.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Easily Change Sizes</strong>: To change sizes with traditional weights, you needs lots of weights on hand, or you need to adjust clips, screw on nuts and clamps etc. Just 3 Dumbags weights give you the equivalent of 7 different weight sizes.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Cost Effective</strong>: Dumbags won't cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars like metal weight sets; they are extremely cost-effective.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Unlimited exercises</strong>: Because of their innovative design features, you are only limited by your imagination as to the type and number of exercises you can do with Dumbags.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Easy to Transport</strong>: Dumbags are lightweight and easily transportable, unlike metal weights which are heavy and cumbersome, and impossible to transport safely.</p>
<p>-       <strong>Innovative Design</strong>: The design of dumbbells and kettlebells has stayed the same for hundreds of years. It's time for something New!</p>
<p> </p>

<p></p>
<h3>These are some of the original prototype bags we have been using in our Personal Training business over the last 12 months</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>This is how the Dumbags weight system works:</p>
<p>Note: Bag sizes are all based on using dry sand filling. Fill the inner bag to the mark on the spout and your bag will be in line with the weight indicated on the bag.</p>
<p>- <strong>HEAVY (Standard)</strong>: Fill with <strong>sand</strong>. </p>
<p>- <strong>EXTRA HEAVY</strong>: Fill with <strong>metal shot/shavings</strong>. </p>
<p>- <strong>MEDIUM</strong>: Fill with a combination of <strong>sand and light padding</strong>.</p>
<p>-<strong> LIGHT</strong>: Fill with light <strong>padding</strong>.</p>

Chase, Blaine, & Michael.

Hi, my name is Michael Coates, from Melbourne Australia, and with my two sons, Chase and Blaine, we have designed a smarter, safer product for the health and fitness industry. 
Introducing DUMBAGS: a sand-filled, material-based alternative to the common dumbbells and kettlebells used in weight and personal training.
Smart weights
In simple terms, Dumbags are sandbags of various sizes and weights, purpose-designed for the fitness and personal training industry. 
Dumbbells and Kettlebells are great, and have helped millions of people get in to shape, however in many circumstances there can be serious problems associated with their use. That's why we created Dumbags - to solve the many problems associated with metal bells, particularly personal injury and property damage. Kettlebells and dumbbells are great and have their place, its just that Dumbags are better! Why? See our 9 main reasons below:

 -      Personal Safety: Dumbags' soft design means dropping or banging a weight on any part of your body will not cause serious injury.
-       Less Noise: Because they are filled with sand, our weights won't make a huge amount of noise when dropped.
-       Avoid Property Damage: Unlike dropping a metal weight, dropping a Dumbag on a timber or tiled floor will not damage the surface - meaning you can work out wherever you want.
-       More Options: Their flexible design allows you to hold more than one Dumbag at a time - rather than just one kettlebell or dumbbell.
-       Easily Change Sizes: To change sizes with traditional weights, you needs lots of weights on hand, or you need to adjust clips, screw on nuts and clamps etc. Just 3 Dumbags weights give you the equivalent of 7 different weight sizes.
-       Cost Effective: Dumbags won't cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars like metal weight sets; they are extremely cost-effective.
-       Unlimited exercises: Because of their innovative design features, you are only limited by your imagination as to the type and number of exercises you can do with Dumbags.
-       Easy to Transport: Dumbags are lightweight and easily transportable, unlike metal weights which are heavy and cumbersome, and impossible to transport safely.
-       Innovative Design: The design of dumbbells and kettlebells has stayed the same for hundreds of years. It's time for something New!
 


These are some of the original prototype bags we have been using in our Personal Training business over the last 12 months

How It Works
This is how the Dumbags weight system works:
Note: Bag sizes are all based on using dry sand filling. Fill the inner bag to the mark on the spout and your bag will be in line with the weight indicated on the bag.
- HEAVY (Standard): Fill with sand. 
- EXTRA HEAVY: Fill with metal shot/shavings. 
- MEDIUM: Fill with a combination of sand and light padding.
- LIGHT: Fill with light padding.



Unique Inner Bags
Their simple design means that bags can be filled with material of any weight. They can be filled, emptied, refilled, packed, transported - whatever suits you! Having an extra inner bag for each weight size (offered in our Perks) is extremely useful as you can: 
1. Have a different type of filling (or weight) for each bag size, and/or 
2. Take your weights away with you when travelling, leaving one filled inner bag at home, and taking the empty one away with you to fill at your destination.

We are offering a geat reward for anyone that refers a friend to our Dumbags Campaign (& they order something) we will double your order - regardless of how big your order is.
if you have already aheived this feat, then just let us know and we will double your order!

 
Weight Combinations
Just 3 Dumbags weights give you the equivalent of 7 standard weights!
Even better, the basic range of 7 sizes gives you more than 40 weight combinations, making them far more cost-effective than kettlebells or dumbbells. 
  
More Great Benefits
 -       Flexible Handle: Comfortably hold 2, 3, or more at a time. We have also developed some handles/hand protectors for extreme exercises such as Crossfit style training and/or intensive prolonged sessions where they might be needed.
  -      More weights, more workouts: The action of gripping more bags can actually assist in the workout. By being able to hold more than 1 weight at a time anyone can quickly and easily change weights by simply adding another bag or changing the mix of sizes.
 -       More Uses: Dumbags are designed to be multi-purpose equipment. You can just grip the bag itself, without holding the handles - this is similar to squeezing spring-loaded hand grippers. They can also be used like medicine balls - and can be thrown and caught safely.
We know they work because we have been using them for years in our own fitness businesses. Part of the reason we have decided to produce them commercially is that our clients have kept asking to buy them!

They are not only practical and functional, but they look fantastic and can be done in any colour combination.

Come with long cords, which either make your desktop messy or are easy to trip over.2). Come with short cords that can only be used in a very limited area.3). Are useless if there is no socket on the wall or floor nearby.4). Are extremely fragile.   A minimalist yet functional LED touch lamp featuring great quality and can be easily carried around.  Simple, Functional, Reliable and Eco-friendly.Cuppa comes in 3 colors and it perfectly blends in with all types of furniture & decorations.    No need to invest in loads of lamps or extension sockets. Say goodbye to your messy desktop. Never trip over power cords again. Simply carry Cuppa around and place it anywhere, anytime! A reading lamp, a bedside lamp, an ambient lamp, a backup lamp during a blackout or even just a final touch to your furniture and décor.       The 360°Any Touch means Cuppa can be switched on/off from any position on the base, no more fumbling around for a tiny switch on the cord. With its patent-pending 360°Any Touch Technology, Cuppa is the world’s first cordless lamp featuring full-body touch control.    Since we designed Cuppa with full-body touch control, why not remove all physical buttons to make it completely minimalist?   More importantly, the buttonless design doesn’t sacrifice any functions. With its 360°Any Touch Technology, Cuppa still features stepless dimming and memory mode. Touch & hold to trigger the stepless dimming.   The memory mode allows you to turn Cuppa back on each time, at the previous brightness level.   Stepless Dimming and Memory Mode makes it easy for users to customize their favorite type of illumination. Featuring TYPE C fast charging, Cuppa can last for 2 hours with only 10 mins charging. With a full charge (2.5 hours), it can stay on for as long as 12 hours.    You can even charge Cuppa with a power bank, meaning that you can use Cuppa as a perfect backup lamp, especially during a blackout.  Lightweight means poor quality, plastic material and a tendency to fall over. Heavyweight lamps are fragile and not easy to move around. Cuppa weighs a decent 1.98lbs (about the same weight as a cup of coffee), which makes it feel as good as it looks.   Meanwhile, the sticky base pad makes Cuppa extremely steady, with zero chance of it falling off.     Vintage style | Modern LED Technology with 80% of Energy-saving 
Save up to 80% energy compared to the standard bulb.
Long life (up to 30,000 hours) - Reduce the hassle and money of replacing bulbs.
Comfort the eyes
4w (40w equivalent)

Recycled Fabric
Water-Resistant
Flame –Retardant
E27 Lampshade Holder
Cuppa is universally compatible with all e27 LED bulbs  ( DC/5v/4w ) and lampshades,     “A small leak will sink a great ship”. That's why we paid so much attention on every single detail of Cuppa. Since Cuppa is designed to be frequently carried around, we built Cuppa to a very strict quality standard. Featuring an IP65 waterproof base, a flame-retardant, and water-resistant lampshade, Cuppa is technically the lamp version of “King Kong Barbie”.       We even make Cuppa 100% safe, there is absolutely no risk of an electrical shock.（Kids-friendly）     CUPPA comes in three colors:
Classic Black
Cream White
Mint Green
      With special THANKS to DINGHAO LIGHTING CO., LTD which is specialized in mobile lighting and provides technical support onto Cuppa.   We wanted to design a smart lamp that would work individually without WIFI, Bluetooth, APPs, a smartphone or a remote controller, but still be smart and minimalist. This may sound crazy but please think about these:
How many APPs do you download but rarely use?
How often you really use them? Is it necessary to use them every single time?
If so, is it a bit of a hassle instead of being enjoyable?
What if the app stops updating?
What if the remote controller goes missing?
What if the smart device is easily broken?
This is where the idea came from, this is why we integrated all the main features into Cuppa, making it a cordless LED touch lamp with excellent quality.       Prototype Demonstration360° Any Touch Control | Stepless Dimming | Fast Charging | Bulb & Lampshade Installation | Waterproof Memory Mode Brightness On/Off Switch (Lock Mode)Sticky Base Pad",59.0,5,"1 Campaign

Stikitty Base (in Prototype Stage) + Stikitty Refill (Existing) = The Stikitty System


Beyond a cat litter mat – Made from environmentally friendly materials, the Stikitty System stops litter tracking and cleans cats’ paws. 
Proven idea, improved concept – The Stikitty Refill is already a successful product, the Stikitty Base extends the effectiveness and appeal with a chic, stylish look.

Painful paws relieved – Litter stuck between cats’ paws can become hardened and painful; the Stikitty System helps separate paws and grab the litter as cats step on the tacky mat.
Make cat litter tracking a thing of the past – The Stikitty System is sticky enough to grab litter but not bother the paws of some of the most finicky cats. And, it stops up to 95% of the litter keeping your home clean and healthy for your family. 
Stikitty Base Rendering for Manufacturing Process 
 
Potential Sizes (please note that we are in the prototype stage and the finished product sizes may adjust slightly): 
 
Small System: -- Base 20"" x 24"" -- Refill 14"" x 18"" 
Standard System: -- Base 24"" x 36"" -- Refill 18"" x 30""  

Sleek, trendy style – We're choosing the latest designer colors and patterns for the Stikitty System because cats and their humans deserve the best. 
You won't need to hide your cat litter mat ever again – The Stikitty System will be pretty enough to show off! 
 
Potential Design Options for the Stikitty Base (Please note: these are sample options and do not necessarily represent the final designs for the Stikitty Base).

<h3>THE MISSION</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Stefan Walz.  I used to be the co-owner of the ""Tabou Tiki Room"".  An infamous tiki bar, and first of its kind, in Berlin, Germany.  The place is long gone now, but it was there that the dream to produce my own infused rum was born.</p>
<p style=""""> </p>

THE MISSION
Hello, my name is Stefan Walz.  I used to be the co-owner of the ""Tabou Tiki Room"".  An infamous tiki bar, and first of its kind, in Berlin, Germany.  The place is long gone now, but it was there that the dream to produce my own infused rum was born.
 
""Tabou"" was a bar that focused on the almost forgotten, rum based cocktails of the old days served in authentic tiki mugs, and an assortment of sipping rums fifty strong.  I had the pleasure of being in charge of searching and acquiring these rums from around the world.  As you can imagine, it was a fun and exciting job.  However, back in 2004 i just could not find a brand of spiced rum that met with my high standards.  What i found was mass produced liquor, flavored with artificial vanilla to cover up the taste of what was quite obviously mediocre rum.  It was through this search that the idea to make my own bottled rum began to form.  Don't get me wrong, i know that there are fine spiced rums out there nowadays, but i want to show that it is possible to produce handcrafted infused rum at a reasonable price, while maintaining a far superior quality to the industry standard.
 
I began by trying several recipes using quality rum with an assortment of exotic spices and various types of fruit infusions.  After several months of experimenting, analyzing, and taste-testing i concocted several unique possibilities, but felt that something crucial was missing.  In the end, it was my girlfriend who suggested the last, key ingredient and I knew that we had crafted something special.  Two weeks and several business meetings later, I had found a way to make naturally infused rum in small batches.

<p><strong>Sud Stud can easily expand over 200%, so it can easily fit almost any 6-8 ounce soap bar whether it's from a homemade soap brand or a larger soap manufacturer.</strong></p>
<p>If your soap is larger or irregular in shape than a 'standard' bar, we'd recommend cutting larger soaps in half so that you only use part inside Sud Stud.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>As outlined in the 72-second video above, I spent quite a bit of time to fully comprehend what the current marketplace options for soap accessories are and the pros/cons of each a loofah puff, natural loofah, bristle brush, and few less popular options that became the basis of how to engineer SudStud.</p>
<p> </p>
<div data-id=""25888673""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/888/673/d14aa239a70029246e06bfd27923c647_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1563821168&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=592801ec8a53b0179d0d5b5030debd5d"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>By first glance, SudStud may look rather simple, but as you'll see below, there is quite a bit of complexity with every unique engineering aspect from the shape, size, and material being considered to create the optimal shower accessory, no matter what type of soap you choose to use with it. </p> <h1><em>A Simple, Yet Complicated Design:</em></h1>
<div data-id=""25889412""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/889/412/7fbd8e72907b907758bfc99b1badd9a2_original.png?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1563825351&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=5e9d61d23fe52e2935c5d578e8a14aef"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>After countless iterations and revisions to my prototypes, you'll find some important highlights below regarding the design and engineering of the final production model:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Size</strong> — Optimally sized to fit the most common soap bar sizes with the ability to adapt to a larger or smaller without much effect on the overall efficiency of Sud Stud's features. </li>
<li>
<strong>Shape</strong> — Hexagonal shape is the optimal design for compatibility with the most popular rectangle shaped soap bars while also being compatible with round, square, or other irregular shaped soap bars.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pillars</strong> — Internally, you'll find 5 pillars that provide support for the edges and holds the soap in place while also allowing SudStud to maintain form as the bather grips or squeezes while scrubbing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Combs</strong> — Patented Honeycomb Grid design reduces friction between soap and skin by 80% that allows one single bar of soap to last 5x longer while also creating 250% more soap suds than a bar alone. </li>
<li>
<strong>Feet</strong> — Externally, 6 circular bumps that allow water to drain and air to flow underneath SudStud after you are done using so the sleeve and soap dry quicker to maintain quality and eliminate bacteria.</li>
<li>
<strong>Materials</strong> — Through testing flexibility, durability, drying, cleaning, safety, and cost of commercially available materials, I found Antimicrobial Silicone would perform the best for SudStud's purpose.</li>
<li>
<strong>Textures</strong> — In addition to the material used, SudStud also offers two texture types on either side, one for deeper exfoliation and the other for a gentler scrub for those with more sensitive skin types.</li>

Soap has been around for thousands of years, and no one has really questioned it.
SudStud eliminates bacteria cultivation, saves money on fancy soaps, and cleans better than your current showering routine.
 

 
SudStud may look simple; however, every aspect from its size, shape, and pillars have a uniquely engineered purpose of cleaning deeper.
 

 
As an alternative to the notoriously filthy loofahs we all use, Sud Stud's innovative design uses less soap and creates a frothier lather for a deeper clean while also eliminating bacteria build-up while awaiting its next use.
 
Hi everyone, I'm Dale and I'm going to solve a few problems you didn't know you had and upgrade your current showering routine.
 

 
When I finally became fed up with the current soap bar options available and being a stubborn millennial, I decided not to switch to body wash but to take it upon myself to create an accessory that will make my favorite soaps bars more efficient. Thus Sud Stud was born, and here we are, on crowdfunding project number two... Reduce Bacteria with SudStud:
Anti-bacterial silicone dries quickly to eliminate germs.
Clean Deeper with SudStud:
Produce 250% more suds with less friction than before.
Scrub Better with SudStud:
One side for exfoliation, the other more for sensitive skin.
Save Money with SudStud:
Your typical bar of soap lasts 5x longer than before.
Not Just for Soap Bars:
Place a few drops of liquid body wash to get the same effect.

SudStud changes the traditional ways of body cleaning by creating a simple to use shower and accessory:
 
 
Sud Stud fits a variety of soap shapes and sizes.
Sud Stud can easily expand over 200%, so it can easily fit almost any 6-8 ounce soap bar whether it's from a homemade soap brand or a larger soap manufacturer.
If your soap is larger or irregular in shape than a 'standard' bar, we'd recommend cutting larger soaps in half so that you only use part inside Sud Stud.
 

 
By cutting in half, it helps those larger and likely more expensive soaps to last even longer (save more money) since you're not exposing the whole bar to running water!
 
SudStud may look simple; however, every aspect from its size, shape, and pillars have a uniquely engineered purpose:
 

 
As outlined in the 72-second video above, I spent quite a bit of time to fully comprehend what the current marketplace options for soap accessories are and the pros/cons of each a loofah puff, natural loofah, bristle brush, and few less popular options that became the basis of how to engineer SudStud.
 

 
By first glance, SudStud may look rather simple, but as you'll see below, there is quite a bit of complexity with every unique engineering aspect from the shape, size, and material being considered to create the optimal shower accessory, no matter what type of soap you choose to use with it.  A Simple, Yet Complicated Design:

 
After countless iterations and revisions to my prototypes, you'll find some important highlights below regarding the design and engineering of the final production model:


Size — Optimally sized to fit the most common soap bar sizes with the ability to adapt to a larger or smaller without much effect on the overall efficiency of Sud Stud's features. 

Shape — Hexagonal shape is the optimal design for compatibility with the most popular rectangle shaped soap bars while also being compatible with round, square, or other irregular shaped soap bars.

Pillars — Internally, you'll find 5 pillars that provide support for the edges and holds the soap in place while also allowing SudStud to maintain form as the bather grips or squeezes while scrubbing.

Combs — Patented Honeycomb Grid design reduces friction between soap and skin by 80% that allows one single bar of soap to last 5x longer while also creating 250% more soap suds than a bar alone. 

Feet — Externally, 6 circular bumps that allow water to drain and air to flow underneath SudStud after you are done using so the sleeve and soap dry quicker to maintain quality and eliminate bacteria.

Materials — Through testing flexibility, durability, drying, cleaning, safety, and cost of commercially available materials, I found Antimicrobial Silicone would perform the best for SudStud's purpose.

Textures — In addition to the material used, SudStud also offers two texture types on either side, one for deeper exfoliation and the other for a gentler scrub for those with more sensitive skin types.

SudStud's design reduces your soaps surface area, allowing your soap to last 5x longer.
 
 
To finish one soap bar with Sud Stud, a regular soap bar user would have already used 4-5.
SudStud's design reduces your soaps surface area by 80% from removing direct soap to skin contact, therefore reducing friction and allowing your soap to last 5x longer. 
 

 


Less Soap Surface Area —Patented Honeycomb comb design reduces soap friction area by 80%, so the soap bar isn't in direct contact with your body, reducing friction tremendously and saving you enormous amounts of soap (money).

Fits Popular & Gourmet Soaps —Your fancy-schmancy, expensive gourmet soap bars will finally be worth buying as SudStud fits most soaps with its ability to expand up to 200% and adjusts to different shapes whether it be the most popular brands or the fancier gourmet soaps with irregular sizes. 

 
Increase suds by up to 250% while exfoliating with Sud Stud's patented honeycomb design.
 

 
SudStud's patented soft-side and scrub-sided honeycomb pattern allow a water block to form, in turn creating a richer and sudsier lather for a deeper skin cleaning. 
 

 


Two-Side Exfoliating Clean —With two sides, a soft silicone side for gentler cleaning or scrub-sided for deeper cleaning and removing dead skin cells, SudStud will not irritate your skin over time like bristles.

More Soapy Suds, Less Water —SudStud's patented soft-side and scrub-sided honeycomb pattern allow a water reservoir to form, in turn creating a richer and sudsier lather with up to 250% more suds for a deeper skin cleaning while also using less water.

 
Flexible and quick to dry, Silicone's anti-microbial properties help it to last through daily use.
 

 
SudStud's ultra-soft, flexible silicone is anti-bacterial and eliminates bacteria build-up prevalent in traditional loofahs while awaiting the next use in its humid environment. 
 

 


Antibacterial Soft Silicone —Unlike traditional shower loofahs, Sud Stud's ultra-soft, flexible silicone is anti-bacterial, eliminating breeding grounds for all kinds of bathroom bacteria bacterium build-up simply by the material that it is made of.

Quick Drying Easy Cleaning —When not in use, Sud Stud 'feet' prop it up, so it dries itself and the soap quickly by letting water and air underneath; and since silicone is a non-porous material, you can clean Sud Stud by submerging in boiling water to thoroughly sanitize.

Not Just For Showering —SudStud was first and foremost designed for a smoother, deeper, and more efficient cleaning while in the bath or shower but we've also found that its antibacterial properties are a great replacement for ditching your filthy kitchen sink sponge.

We started working on the design in late 2015, and today,  we have designed the world's most compact 3D Printer!
Don’t believe us ? Here’s a fact
 It is 20 cm Cube! How we designed it?
A 3D Printer's important specs is its Build volume i.e, how much volume it can print. We kept the standard build volume for a mini printer 1000 cubic cm.  The next important thing is the 'guideways and mechanisms' to move the extruder in all 3 direction. In most of the 3D Printers, the mechanism made the size so big and not compact. After thorough system analysis, Extraordinary Design Principles and FE Analysis were made and we come up with a mini guideway system where the motors are inbuilt and small. This helped us to reduce 50% of size in all the sides thereby improving the aesthetics too. We are using the best budash nozzle in extruder with auto leveling sensor for beds. For preventing the printer from accidents, we have provided clean fiber glass enclosure in 3 sides, which allow us to see what is going on inside.

<p>""PowerCloth 1G"" is a light-weight, flexible, foldable and washable solar fabric that can be attached to almost anything to turn that into a 5 Volt charging port.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exoticsolar.com/pictures/PowerCloth1G.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 752px; height: 520px;""/></p>
<p><strong>                                                            </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motiviation:</strong>We receive a tremendous amount of energy every day from sun. If <strong><em>our outfits can somehow convert </em></strong>even a tiny part of that into useful electricity, it will fulfill the electricity needs of all of our electronic gadgets while we are outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Traditional solar cells cannot be used for the above task because these cells are brittle and very fragile. As a result, these need to be protected inside metallic frames which make them very heavy. For the application of solar cells in outfits, these cells need to be light weight, flexible and foldable.</p>
<p>         </p>
<p><strong>How is PowerCloth 1G different from other/similar products?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PowerCloth 1G is light-weight, weighs less than 3 ounces and is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Flexible, foldable, sturdy and amazingly unique in its self.</li>
<li>PowerCloth 1G provides an output current of about 700 mA charging your smart electronic devices in just 2-3 hrs.</li>
<li>PowerCloth 1G is capable of charging a 1800 mAh lithium ion powerpack in 3-4 hrs of sunlight. Using this powerpack, you can charge your gadgets at night and can light a 10 LED lamp for more than 12 hrs.</li>
<li>Most value added product at a much cheaper price, generating efficient energy for our day to day use.</li>
</ul><p>Another fascinating and unique feature that distinguishes PowerCloth 1G from other contemporary products is that it is washable: just separate the fabric from the photovoltaic element, wash it and then slide the photovoltaic element back into the fabric.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://exoticsolar.com/pictures/PC1G.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></div>
<div class=""template asset""><strong>PowerCloth 1G is efficient; it can work even in weak and diffused lighting situations.</strong></div>

<p>We need your help to spread the word about the PowerCloth 1G, the first portable, flexible and washable solar panel. You'll be amongst the first to have one before the whole world knows about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>

""PowerCloth 1G"" is a light-weight, flexible, foldable and washable solar fabric that can be attached to almost anything to turn that into a 5 Volt charging port.

                                                            
Motiviation:We receive a tremendous amount of energy every day from sun. If our outfits can somehow convert even a tiny part of that into useful electricity, it will fulfill the electricity needs of all of our electronic gadgets while we are outdoors.
Problem: Traditional solar cells cannot be used for the above task because these cells are brittle and very fragile. As a result, these need to be protected inside metallic frames which make them very heavy. For the application of solar cells in outfits, these cells need to be light weight, flexible and foldable.
         
How is PowerCloth 1G different from other/similar products?

PowerCloth 1G is light-weight, weighs less than 3 ounces and is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts.
Flexible, foldable, sturdy and amazingly unique in its self.
PowerCloth 1G provides an output current of about 700 mA charging your smart electronic devices in just 2-3 hrs.
PowerCloth 1G is capable of charging a 1800 mAh lithium ion powerpack in 3-4 hrs of sunlight. Using this powerpack, you can charge your gadgets at night and can light a 10 LED lamp for more than 12 hrs.
Most value added product at a much cheaper price, generating efficient energy for our day to day use.
Another fascinating and unique feature that distinguishes PowerCloth 1G from other contemporary products is that it is washable: just separate the fabric from the photovoltaic element, wash it and then slide the photovoltaic element back into the fabric.

PowerCloth 1G is efficient; it can work even in weak and diffused lighting situations.
 
                                       

        PowerCloth 1G weighs approximately 2.6 ounces (75 grams).

 
Why do we need your support?
We need your help to spread the word about the PowerCloth 1G, the first portable, flexible and washable solar panel. You'll be amongst the first to have one before the whole world knows about it.
 
What's next?
We’re now getting prepared to start commercial production of the PowerCloth 1G. With your support, we'll be able to start our first manufacturing run by August, 2012. We hope to start shipping them to you by September, 2012.

<p><strong>We adhere to strict quality standards</strong> and only work with responsible, certified manufacturers. To us, sustainability and the preservation of Earth's natural beauty is uncompromisingly our <strong>#1 priority.</strong> With the funding, we are planning to invest in new processes and systems that will allow us to lower and completely <strong>reverse our carbon footprint</strong> making us a carbon-negative company (meaning we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit)! One of the ways we plan to do this by planting trees as carbon offsets. Did you know just 1 tree can remove 48 lbs. of carbon emissions from the atmosphere each year?!?</p>
<p>In terms of the products, we've gone through <strong>MANY</strong> iterations over the months, from the design to the materials used. We are making several changes to the products in order to bring something new and exciting to the table! Our main focus is to only use the best, most <strong>sustainable materials</strong>. This includes using <strong>recycled packaging, sustainably harvested</strong> materials and even <strong>repurposing</strong> <strong>materials</strong> that otherwise would have been manufacturing waste. </p>
<p><strong>Backing us will allow us to bring the starter kit into production</strong> at scale and bring us one step closer to a trash-free planet ?</p>

<p><strong>Zero Waste MVMT</strong> was founded in 2018 by Zac and Janelle. The idea to contribute to and promote this eco-friendly movement came to fruition after travelling abroad for almost a year.</p>
<p>Their entire perspective on waste management and pollution changed after experiencing the detrimental effects on the environment first-hand. In less developed countries, they saw exactly what was happening to waste, it often contaminated beaches, gathered in “landfills” and even burned on the side of the road since there isn’t much in place for waste management facilities.</p>
<p>This is something that is often overlooked in western countries. Garbage is brought to the street side, it is taken away and that is the end of it. Out of sight, out of mind. But the reality of it is, all this waste IS going somewhere, it’s collecting in landfills, contaminating waterways, ending up in our oceans and much more.</p>
<p>This is what sparked the idea for Zero Waste MVMT. We decided we HAD to do something positive to raise awareness and contribute to the movement. Our mission is to inspire people around us and encourage them to live a more sustainable lifestyle. We want to help by collectively reducing waste and making sustainable products accessible to everyone. Together, we can help our precious Mother Earth thrive for generations to come!</p>

</div></div>","By re-shaping and re-evaluating our consumption habits!
For the past 5 decades, plastic has become a leading material in manufacturing. Why? For ""convenience"" at home and on-the-go.
With these new products, we are offering eco-friendly alternatives to the most common types of everyday plastics. Straws, produce bags, utensils, cling wrap and more! 

 
 
All of our products have been designed to facilitate the transition to a zero-waste lifestyle!
It's obvious that plastic has negative effects on our planet, but we know that it isn't always easy to refuse plastic when you're stuck in a pinch
Our products are easy to adapt to your lifestyle, making it CONVENIENT and FUN to be zero waste!


Zero Waste Essentials (Early-Bird)
We've compiled a beautiful collection of all our zero waste favourites into one box that will help kickstart your new lifestyle! This kit is what will be sent out to backers that choose (Zero Waste Essentials)! Items are already heavily discounted making this the best bang for your buck! On top of receiving the starter kit, we are also including access to our Zero Waste Club a community where we can support and encourage each other to live our best, waste-free lives :) 
Each starter kit comes with...

3 pack of beeswax wraps
6 pack of reusable produce bags
10 pack of bamboo straws
Bamboo travel utensil set
Wooden dish brush
12 pack of reusable makeup remover pads



A Closer Look At The Starter Kit... Reusable Makeup Remover Pads
Makeup remover pads are an absolute essential for any zero waste bathroom!
Our triple-layered reusable make-up remover pads are soft, gentle on your skin, durable, and will leave your face feeling clean and refreshed. One pad is equivalent to 1000 disposable cotton rounds.
We make it easy to wash and reuse the pads with the handy-dandy drawstring laundry bag. You can simply use the pads and throw the entire bag in the wash when you’re ready. Leave the pads out to dry and they will be good as new the next morning!
Material: 70% bamboo, 30% cotton


 
6x Organic Mesh Produce Bags
The reusable produce bags are made from organic cotton and are tightly woven to increase durability and longevity! With the double-stitched seams and a metal clasp drawstring, it makes them the perfect alternative to single-use plastic bags at the grocery store.
This set comes with 6 bags. 2 large, 2 medium and 2 small which makes it perfect for bagging, carrying and storing vegetables, fruits, nuts and bulk goods!
Material: GOTS certified organic cotton
Sizes: L- 40x30 cm. M- 30x25 cm. S- 25x20 cm.



 
Beeswax wraps
 Beeswax wraps are an eco-friendly alternative to plastic cling wrap. Our wraps are 100% natural and made with beeswax, jojoba oil and tree resin.
These colourful, fun wraps come in 3 different sizes with our signature pattern. They are perfect for covering leftover food, fruits and veggies.
Instructions: Use the heat of your hands to soften and activate the wraps as you place them around bread, cheese, bowls, cups and more!



 
Travel Bamboo Utensil Set with Pouch
All-natural, eco-friendly, biodegradable bamboo cutlery set including fork, spoon, knife, chopsticks and a straw + cleaner brush.
This set rolls up nicely and is secured with a metal snap fastener. It is the perfect size to keep in your car, purse, backpack, or lunchbox!
An estimated 40 billion plastic utensils are thrown away each year! The biggest issue is that plastic utensils are “convenient” and that you’re usually left with no other alternative while out and about.
Keeping a set of these utensils with you will make it easy to say no to single-use plastic utensils when you’re on the go, getting take out or wherever else! 


 
Wooden Dish Brush
Our cleaning brushes feature a durable wood handle and sisal bristles on a replaceable head. Sisal is a natural fibre derived from the long green leaves of the ‘agave sisalana’ cactus plant. They are all-natural and sustainably harvested.
These bristles are the perfect combination of durable and soft for scrubbing dishes in the kitchen and tubs in the bathroom but aren’t abrasive to cause scratching or damaging.




 
We adhere to strict quality standards and only work with responsible, certified manufacturers. To us, sustainability and the preservation of Earth's natural beauty is uncompromisingly our #1 priority. With the funding, we are planning to invest in new processes and systems that will allow us to lower and completely reverse our carbon footprint making us a carbon-negative company (meaning we remove more carbon from the atmosphere than we emit)! One of the ways we plan to do this by planting trees as carbon offsets. Did you know just 1 tree can remove 48 lbs. of carbon emissions from the atmosphere each year?!?
In terms of the products, we've gone through MANY iterations over the months, from the design to the materials used. We are making several changes to the products in order to bring something new and exciting to the table! Our main focus is to only use the best, most sustainable materials. This includes using recycled packaging, sustainably harvested materials and even repurposing materials that otherwise would have been manufacturing waste. 
Backing us will allow us to bring the starter kit into production at scale and bring us one step closer to a trash-free planet ?


 
Zero Waste MVMT was founded in 2018 by Zac and Janelle. The idea to contribute to and promote this eco-friendly movement came to fruition after travelling abroad for almost a year.
Their entire perspective on waste management and pollution changed after experiencing the detrimental effects on the environment first-hand. In less developed countries, they saw exactly what was happening to waste, it often contaminated beaches, gathered in “landfills” and even burned on the side of the road since there isn’t much in place for waste management facilities.
This is something that is often overlooked in western countries. Garbage is brought to the street side, it is taken away and that is the end of it. Out of sight, out of mind. But the reality of it is, all this waste IS going somewhere, it’s collecting in landfills, contaminating waterways, ending up in our oceans and much more.
This is what sparked the idea for Zero Waste MVMT. We decided we HAD to do something positive to raise awareness and contribute to the movement. Our mission is to inspire people around us and encourage them to live a more sustainable lifestyle. We want to help by collectively reducing waste and making sustainable products accessible to everyone. Together, we can help our precious Mother Earth thrive for generations to come!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can Kibbi connect
with my other devices?</b></p>
<p>We’ll be releasing a SDK so developers can make their own
applications, integrate into existing systems, build a school/college project,
or just about anything that comes to mind really.  The SDK will allow you to communicate with
the either the Kibbi Sensors directly using Bluetooth Low Energy, or the
complete Kibbi system over Wi-Fi/Ethernet using our JSON API.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Will my pet
activate Kibbi’s motion detection?</b></p>
<p>For Kibbi, we have developed an advanced object profiling
to identify your pet(s) to prevent false alerts. Similar to the way a camera
can identify where people’s faces are.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What happens in
the event of a power-cut?</b></p>
<p>Kibbi has battery backup (4 x AAA batteries), and also a
USB port for a data network stick so Kibbi can keep protecting your home for a
few hours even if the power is lost. You will be notified on your phone that
mains power has been lost. If you don’t use a data network stick then our
servers will detect your Kibbi is offline and we’ll let you know.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I don’t want to
use your Cloud service or I don’t want to enable Live Stream, can they be turned
off?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Kibbi has been designed to offer the services and
level of protection you are comfortable with. You can choose to save video
footage locally and live streaming can be completely switched off. Because
Kibbi has Bluetooth connection, these feature settings can only be set locally,
not over the Internet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Which phones do
Kibbi work with?</b></p>
<p>iOS devices running iOS 7.1 or newer with Bluetooth 4.0

Meet the BioLite BaseLantern
The BioLite BaseLantern is the world’s first flatpack lantern that combines breakthrough edge-lighting with Bluetooth connectivity to bring you a portable lighting solution that doubles as your own miniature smartgrid. No bigger than the sandwich you pack in your lunch, the BaseLantern can light large group settings, charge phones and other devices, and offer powerful real-time analytics so you get the most from your off-grid energy.













Light Your Site.Illuminate large areas with a lantern that fits in the palm of your hand; extend light around your site with the integration of BioLite string lighting.

Power Your Gear.The rechargeable internal battery doubles as a portable powerbank to charge phones, tablets, and other devices. 

Bluetooth Control.Unlock the functionality of a mini smart grid from your phone with features like Proximity Activation, Full Color Control, and Real Time Energy Analytics.


BaseLantern is ready for any off-grid situation:












Edge Lighting: Big Light In A Small Package
When you went camping twenty years ago, chances are you brought along a big bulky sleeping bag with you – but then compression sacks came along and took the air out, shrinking your bag into a fraction of its original size. 








That’s exactly what we’re doing with the BaseLantern – we’re taking the air out. Using the same principles found in fiber-optic cables, we've skinned our lantern's rechargeable batteries in a thin, durable, bright sheet of light.


By using edge-lighting rather than traditional diffusing lenses, we're able to remove wasted space and deliver a lantern that's four times smaller than the competition.


Here's a quick video where Mike and Anton explain how it works:







The result is a super compact lantern that can throw 500 lumens of light in a footprint no bigger than, well, a sandwich:










Shareable Energy: The Power to Do More
The BaseLantern features a 7800 mAh rechargeable li-on battery that provides a burn time of up to 54 hours or power out to your other electronic gear via 2 USB charging ports. 
The BaseLantern also features two custom ports to power BioLite SiteLights for extended lighting. 



SiteLights provide 10 ft of reach and 150 lumens per light



And with two USB ports, no waiting in line to charge up your phone if you’re with friends.





 



Charging Cycles By Device



You can recharge your BaseLantern off-grid anytime from power generating gear like the BioLite SolarPanel5+ or BioLite BaseCamp Stove (you can pick those up in our reward levels).

Unlocking the Smartgrid: Light & Power Controlled from Your Pocket



BaseLantern Bluetooth LE Mobile App



Your phone is one of the best remote controls out there, so we built a custom Low Energy Bluetooth app that connects with your BaseLantern and transforms it into your own miniature smartgrid:





The app’s dark background is easy on the eyes in low-light conditions and is designed to be super intuitive – so if a friend picks up your phone, there’s no learning curve, they can use it right away.

Adding Lantern Effects



The BaseLantern app also provides real-time analytics and feedback on the battery life so you can calibrate energy usage to sustain the length of your trip – no guessing on how much juice is left.



Energy Analytics



Proximity Activation automatically turns the BaseLantern on or off based on your relative location. Your own personal beacon, it's perfect for finding your way home in the dark.

<p>We originally planned on a courthouse elopement with two close friends as witnesses, but sadly, a snitch (don't worry, he got stitches) couldn't keep his mouth shut and the event has clearly escalated to the point where we're asking for help from complete strangers.</p>
<p>You may be wondering what your money will be used for and to answer your question, we have a few ideas we've been kicking around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag Queen MC</li>
<li>Chicken and Waffles as a catered meal</li>
<li>Beer Pong tournament</li>
<li>and many more...</li>
</ul>
<p>The real reason we're here is that we are lacking in the ideas (and funds) department. So that's where you come in. As you can see in the offered perks, you have many options on how to be part of this special day, as well as the planning itself. We welcome any suggestions in the comments, and will be sending out surveys for final decisions on topics like whether or not we should get a penis cake. All of this you will be able to see through the livestream we plan on hosting throughout the wedding/reception. So help us make this the most insane and memorable wedding yet!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're attempting to plan a wedding in ONE month, so yeah, there's that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think this is a great idea, share this campaign with your friends, your dog, your nana and her bff Rose (just so you know, they both could've fit on that door...)</p>

more food are produce during the same time in comparison to standard home gardens 

or farms.
<br/>
</li>
<li>
It is automated (automatically water the plants and automatically filters the 

water) and recirculated the water. It conserve water because it re-uses its own 

water, so it can be used in drought area, green house, roof top, balcony..etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Recycled water from the filters and recirculated it with little lost.<br/>
</li>
<li>

soil and no soil base diseases. It does not use any pesticide or chemicals, making 

the plants safer.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Our design is self sustainable and is a closed environment.<br/>
</li>
<li>Our system has an aqua tank that uses fish to organically fertilize the plants 

or used without fish as a fertilized water tank.</li>

<p></p><h4><font color=""#0F700F"">A large garden in a small space</font></h4>
<p>You don't need a farm or a large backyard to grow fresh vegetables and fruits. 

You don't even need a garden. With AIO Innovation system you can get a high yield 

in a small space. It is remarkable how many delicious vegetables or fruits you can 

fit into a small growing area. You just need plenty of sunshine or grow light.</p>
<p>Seed companies are frequently producing new varieties of vegetables that can be 

grown as dwarf plants, in small areas and even in pots. They would fit in 

perfectly with AIO Innovation system.</p>
<p>There is small water requirements and small land requirements with high yields 

year round in shorter time. Which is perfect for both the home user and urban 

farmer.</p>
<h4>
<b><font color=""#0F700F"">What makes our system unique?</font></b><br/>
</h4>
<p> Our system combine the best of hydroponic, aquaponic, low pressure gravity fed 

aeroponic, vertical farming, bio-sand filter, radial swirl filter container, fish 

or liquid solution tank using a air water siphon pump and design for a small 

carbon footprint with automation into a unique all in one automated self contain 

system.</p>
<p>It will limit water usage by using aquaculture water as fertilizer for the 

plants. It will recycle the water and clean it through radial swirl container 

filter and bio-sand filter before recirculating back to the fish tank or can be 

use without the aquaculture part and just use liquid fertilizer. <br/><br/>It is an 

All In One stack-able and customizable system that can fit either home user or 

expandable to urban farming or extended even more to maximize farming space. It 

can be use indoor or in greenhouse or for year round farming or for limited space 

farming in an automated way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AIO Innovation system works great in drought conditions as it recycle 

water. </p>
<p>Our system also doesn't use any soil. Our soil-less design means no soil base 

diseases and no need to replace the soil. Which also allows it to be use almost 

anywhere. </p>The radial swirl container is design in a new unique way to make it 

easy to clean.<br/><br/>This system is using a locking net pot and neoprene collar 

media system (does not use soil)<br/><br/>This is a self contain automated system 

and easy to use after set up. <br/><br/>It is organic by using fish waste as 

fertilizer and not any chemicals. As it is soil-less, there is no soil based 

disease and no need for pesticide indoor.<br/><br/>It doesn't have any soil base 

disease as there is no soil media. This also means no crop rotation is needed and 

no soil replacement is needed.<br/><br/>It grows the plants 2x-5x faster by watering 

oxygenated micro droplet directly to the roots and uses less space then standard 

farming techniques that uses soil.<br/><br/>It uses less electricity with a air 

water siphon pump (aka AWS pump or Airlift pump).<br/><br/>It is automated with 

timer, air water siphon pump, and allows a 3rd party automated feeder for the 

fish. <br/><br/><h4><b><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fac_5Wo8GPvU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dac_5Wo8GPvU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fac_5Wo8GPvU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></b></h4><h4><b><font color=""#0F700F"">What AIO Innovation system offers</font></b></h4>

Additional information about our system


It maximize food production without taking up too much space and water, due to our 

special vertical multi-configuration patent pending design. which means it can 

grow more compare to conventional gardens.



It can grow plants 365 days a year indoors. While growing 2x-5x faster which means 

more food are produce during the same time in comparison to standard home gardens 

or farms.



It is automated (automatically water the plants and automatically filters the 

water) and recirculated the water. It conserve water because it re-uses its own 

water, so it can be used in drought area, green house, roof top, balcony..etc.


Recycled water from the filters and recirculated it with little lost.


It has an aeroponic soil-less design, so it can be use in any location without 

soil and no soil base diseases. It does not use any pesticide or chemicals, making 

the plants safer.


Our design is self sustainable and is a closed environment.

Our system has an aqua tank that uses fish to organically fertilize the plants 

or used without fish as a fertilized water tank.

AIO Innovation System is designed to be easy as building blocks to put together 

for different configurations as desire.


A large garden in a small space
You don't need a farm or a large backyard to grow fresh vegetables and fruits. 

You don't even need a garden. With AIO Innovation system you can get a high yield 

in a small space. It is remarkable how many delicious vegetables or fruits you can 

fit into a small growing area. You just need plenty of sunshine or grow light.
Seed companies are frequently producing new varieties of vegetables that can be 

grown as dwarf plants, in small areas and even in pots. They would fit in 

perfectly with AIO Innovation system.
There is small water requirements and small land requirements with high yields 

year round in shorter time. Which is perfect for both the home user and urban 

farmer.

What makes our system unique?

 Our system combine the best of hydroponic, aquaponic, low pressure gravity fed 

aeroponic, vertical farming, bio-sand filter, radial swirl filter container, fish 

or liquid solution tank using a air water siphon pump and design for a small 

carbon footprint with automation into a unique all in one automated self contain 

system.
It will limit water usage by using aquaculture water as fertilizer for the 

plants. It will recycle the water and clean it through radial swirl container 

filter and bio-sand filter before recirculating back to the fish tank or can be 

use without the aquaculture part and just use liquid fertilizer. It is an 

All In One stack-able and customizable system that can fit either home user or 

expandable to urban farming or extended even more to maximize farming space. It 

can be use indoor or in greenhouse or for year round farming or for limited space 

farming in an automated way.

AIO Innovation system works great in drought conditions as it recycle 

water. 
Our system also doesn't use any soil. Our soil-less design means no soil base 

diseases and no need to replace the soil. Which also allows it to be use almost 

anywhere. The radial swirl container is design in a new unique way to make it 

easy to clean.This system is using a locking net pot and neoprene collar 

media system (does not use soil)This is a self contain automated system 

and easy to use after set up. It is organic by using fish waste as 

fertilizer and not any chemicals. As it is soil-less, there is no soil based 

disease and no need for pesticide indoor.It doesn't have any soil base 

disease as there is no soil media. This also means no crop rotation is needed and 

no soil replacement is needed.It grows the plants 2x-5x faster by watering 

oxygenated micro droplet directly to the roots and uses less space then standard 

farming techniques that uses soil.It uses less electricity with a air 

water siphon pump (aka AWS pump or Airlift pump).It is automated with 

timer, air water siphon pump, and allows a 3rd party automated feeder for the 

fish. What AIO Innovation system offers
Our system let you grow your own fresh organic fruits and vegetables plants 

while at the same time help you be more independent with your food 

resources.
Our system let you grow your own fish.
Our system maximize space to grow your plants in limited indoor space.
Our system helps if you are too busy to watch over it everyday because it is 

a self contain closed environment and automated (self watering, self water 

filtering and self fertilizing garden). It is lower maintenance with less clean up 

and no soil replacement because we are a soil-less design.
Our system has a seed starter to help you get started.
Our system allows you to grow food year round indoors.
Our system can help customized your garden to fit your needs by offer 8 

customized configurations for both small and large requirements.
Our system has a bio sand  and radial swirl water filter for cleaning the water 

in the aqua tank.
Our system has a versatile design to fit inside a house, a greenhouse, a 

balcony or any urban settings.
Our system can potentially reduce water usage by 98%, reduce fertilizer by 

100%, reduce chemical by 100%, reduce pesticide by 100%, reduce polluted water run 

off by 100%

Some problems with existing gardening technology vs AIO Innovation system
High pressure aeroponic systems tend to get clog and require a lot more maintenance and takes a lot of space. 


Our system is low pressure and is low maintenance and it doesn't take a lot of space.

Vertical farming tend to require liquid fertilizer replacement and soil replacement. 


Our system uses fishes to fertilize the plants in a continuous life cycle and it does not use soil, making it easier and cheaper in the long run.

Aquaponic takes up a lot of space (horizontal). 


Our system uses less horizontal space in comparison while producing more food. Our system is also design for the home users and urban farmers instead of pure large scale commercial uses.

Hydroponic takes up a lot of space (horizontal) and need fertilizer. 


Our system uses less horizontal space in comparison, have fresh fishes as additional food resources and that recycled fish waste as fertilizer.

Most conventional garden require soils (lots of soil for the plants). 


Our system is soil less and does not require yearly replacement of soil or fertilizer or crop rotation. Also unlike outdoor gardens, there is less labor needed. There is also no soil based diseases.  About 71% of the earth is cover by water and of the 29% land mass only a small percentage of that is farm-able land, but our system allows it to be use in most locations. This include undersea hotels, cruise ships, sea rigs, deserts, mountainsides, or most other location without soil.

Swirl container are not as efficient as a radial swirl container and are not easy to clean. 


Our radial swirl container is more efficient and is easier to clean with our unique design.

Most systems are not available for the average home owner, but are only available for the DIY (Do it yourself) or large commercial farms. 


Our flexible system is available for everyone ranging from small individual grower to larger urban farms (school, restaurant, rooftop, airport, grocery, etc..) to larger commercial farms.

Most system require a lot of electricity, water, soil, fertilizer and maintenance. 


Our system has a low carbon footprint with low energy requirement, low water requirement, no soil, no fertilizer and low maintenance.

Most systems are not automated. 


Ours system is design to have automated watering, automated water filtering and allow 3rd party automated fish feeding. This is less labor intensive compare to traditional gardening.

Property damage from home burglaries exceeds $2000 on average per event. Burglars are 3X as likely to break into a home with no visible signs of a security system.

OLARM™ FUNCTIONS
One sensor covers the whole room, each is equipped with a motion detector that can feel body heat using our advanced PIR technology, and it can also detect noise through a proprietary built-in microphone design.
The Olarm™ sensor detects motion regardless of available light. When your system is ARMED, the motion function is activated. It can detect heat and movement in the surrounding areas, creating a protective “grid.” This technology ensures intruders cannot pass unnoticed. Yet, Olarm's motion sensors are designed to avoid false alarms, such as small and large pets.    Olarm’s built-in microphone technology listens for sounds in your home and detects noise activity anywhere it is placed. The system alerts you instantly if something unusual happens, like a smoke detector going off, glass shattering, or even a loud bang that could indicate a forced entry.   Olarm™ detects leaks using two leads placed in the bottom of the sensor.

Burglars use the front door about 50% of the time. 65% of burglaries occur in the daytime and a surprising 74% of burglaries happen in residential neighborhoods, not in businesses, like banks and stores. Property damage from home burglaries exceeds $2000 on average per event. Burglars are 3X as likely to break into a home with no visible signs of a security system.

On this topic of home insurance discounts, the president of the Electronic Security Association, Dom D'Ascoli, notes, ""A survey of the 10 largest insurance companies offering homeowners coverage found premium discounts up to 20 percent if a home is equipped with a monitored alarm system.” Based on the 2018 average annual cost of homeowner insurance of $1083, you can save up to 20% or about $216 annually. Our 24/7 professional monitoring service will cost you only $120 annually ($10/month), now what's your excuse? DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT  We have replaced all the bulky, traditional, old school hardware and hard wiring, and bring you these silver dollar sized smart sensors to life.

My name is Haobin Lin and I am originally from Mainland China. When I was a young boy I was fortunate enough to grow up in the magnificent Chinese countryside. Beautiful plants and animals surrounded me. <b>This experience left me with a deep connection to nature.</b> I always felt calm amidst its tranquility.</p><p>Unfortunately though, as I grew older and took on new responsibilities I was forced to leave my village. First I went to university, and then to the big city to earn an income for my family. <b>Over time the longing for the natural world grew inside me</b>, but it wasn’t until about 5 years ago that I finally had to act.</p><p>When my daughter was born I decided that if it was impossible for us to leave the city, <b>I must bring the beauty of nature to my daughter.</b> So began a 3-year journey to create the best indoor garden I could design.</p><p>One day I noticed my daughter playing with her favorite toys – “building blocks.” In that moment I realized that indoor gardens could be so much more than just a bunch of pots. <b>By allowing you to stack and expand your pots everyone can create a unique garden</b> just like my daughters unique building creations.</p><p>The Lego-like design has the added benefit of fitting into smaller spaces like our apartment. However, it also provides flexibility, so that my daughter can <b>move and expand her garden as she grows</b>. Once I began to design the pot I realized that this garden could be so much more.</p><div data-id=""16229263""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511446572/hwhrqmslkzidz7jx5pil.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> <b>I noticed that indoor gardens could be quite messy!</b> This is because of the multiple ventilation holes on the bottom of traditional pots, allowing excess water and soil to get everywhere. So as I designed our planter pots I added an internal water reservoir that can capture the excess water and an elevated ventilation hole to reduce soil escape.</p><p>With the mess taken care of, I quickly realized that we needed to improve the lighting in our apartment if we wanted anything to grow to its fullest. My wife and daughter were particularly keen on succulents and would often leave them on the windowsill to get light, yet that still was not enough. So I set about to design <b>a lighting fixture that could provide for multiple plants at once</b> and have an automatic shut off so they don’t get too much light.</p><p>At this point things were going well and our plants were getting better, but some still continued to struggle. After some research I realized that many plants require moisture in the air to thrive.</p><p>Instead of buying an off-the-shelf humidifier I decided to create something beautiful, compact, and would match our building block concept. This provided an especially difficult challenge for me and <b>it took 23 designs before I finally created a 360° diffusing mist humidifier.</b></p><p>Not only do our plants get the moisture they need, but it also provides additional health benefits. My eyes are less stressed and I sneeze far less often when I work next to the humidifier. At this point our garden system was shaping up to be a beautiful, easy-to-use masterpiece, but <b>there was still one more thing I wanted to do.</b></p><div data-id=""16333675""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1498579178/krfvljrl1h1nshejhhco.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Since I spend countless hours at the office I wanted to add some greenery to my desk. Our system works perfectly for workspaces, but one day I thought <b>‘wouldn’t it be cool if I could charge my phone with the plant on my desk?’</b> I immediately started working on our Power Pot. </p><p>This mini power hub has 4 USB ports, so that it can power the LED lamp and humidifier, plus my phone and tablet.</p><p>It wasn’t until we completed the Power Pot prototype that I realized how incredibly convenient it truly was. Any desk, end table, or counter can now have a beautiful plant and a <b>quick-charge station!</b></p><p>This whole project over the past 3 years has been an amazing experience. Not only was the LeGrow Smart Garden born, but also, I was able to <b>spend quality time with my daughter</b> planting, growing, and expanding our home garden. Now we hope to share this experience with you.</p><p>The money we raise here on Kickstarter will provide us with the <b>capital necessary to start full production of the LeGrow Smart Garden.</b> We hope someday it can help millions of people reconnect with nature and grow something beautiful.

<p><b>LeGrow Humidifier </b>- The missing link to growing plants. The #1 cause of plants dying indoors is from lack of moisture in the air. This could be from heating, air conditioning, or a desert environment. LeGrows compact, beautifully designed humidifier adds moisture to the air and also acts as a water storage device for convenience. Small but powerful, this humidifier can release more than 30 ml of water per hour for up to 6 hours. It automatically shuts off when out of water and will resume when refilled. A must-have for all indoor plant enthusiasts. What's more, having a humidifier indoors can improve the air that you breath too, <b>benefiting your lungs, overall health, and even reducing dry skin.</b></p>

<p><b>LeGrow Power Pot</b> - Combining nature with modernity. Say goodbye to ugly power sockets and cables, and instead charge your smart phones, tablets, or any other USB-powered device via your plants. The power pot is equipped with 4 USB ports (DC 5V, 36W total output power, input voltage 100-240V AC) that support fast charging, and are waterproof so you can water your plants while you charge. A smart switch allows you to turn the power on when inserting a growing pot on top of the power pot. A great accessory for any workspace.</p>
<p><b>Base Growing Pot</b> - This is where your garden starts. The base pots can be stacked or connected together with base trays to keep your garden clean and tidy. Using silicon connectors you can stack the pots as high as you want, and in fun designs. Each pot is 8.5cm by 8.5cm and is designed to retain up to 30 ml of water, allowing you to water less often.</p>
<p>We hope that through the Smart Gardens flexibility and add ons, growing plants indoors will become easier and fun. LeGrow has designed a simple system that allows you to grow what you want, where you want. We believe that by bringing nature indoors you will be able to reap the benefits that plants can provide us. From reducing stress and anxiety levels, improving air quality and oxygen levels, to even making us more productive and sharpening focus, the benefits are endless.</p>

</div></div>","The LeGrow Smart Garden is a complete indoor garden ecosystem. The garden itself is a modular setup where each individual planter pot acts as a building block. This allows you to stack, expand, and build your garden into limitless creations. 
The ecosystem includes advanced planter pots, LED grow lamps, humidifiers, and a unique Power Pot with 4 USB charging ports. Each Smart Garden set comes with a different selection of features and you can get the Power Pots as a stand-alone. See the reward options on the right side of your screen.    Clean and Simple Planter pots can be messy! Most come with multiple drainage holes on the bottom of the pot to allow water to escape. We’ve integrated an internal water reservoir into our design. This not only captures the excess water, preventing it from spilling out, but also means you can water less frequently. This design allows for the pots to be placed directly on your desk or furniture with less risk of leakage or soil escaping.
 Modular, LEGO®-like Assembly The modular shape of our plant pots allows for limitless creativity. Make your own unique plant arrangements. Stack them high, spread them out, add additional humidifiers or lamps, and grow a large variety of plants and flowers.LED Grow Lamp Our two-bulb LED grow lamp provides nourishing light for a variety of plants. It can be set in 6-hour increments so that your plants get the light they need to flourish. Generating up to 50,000 Lux and height adjustable, our lamp is perfect for winter growing.

 
360° Humidifier Most plants die due to a lack of moisture in the air. This is particularly problematic with indoor environments when heating and air conditioning is present. Our humidifier distributes moisture 360°, providing necessary water for plant growth. In addition, humidifiers have been shown to help reduce eyestrain, soften skin, and have many other health benefits.Quick Charging Pot Our Power Pot includes 4 USB ports to power all your USB devices, including a Quick Charge 3.0 port for your smart phone. This pot is ideal for side tables and workspaces.     Hi there! My name is Haobin Lin and I am originally from Mainland China. When I was a young boy I was fortunate enough to grow up in the magnificent Chinese countryside. Beautiful plants and animals surrounded me. This experience left me with a deep connection to nature. I always felt calm amidst its tranquility.Unfortunately though, as I grew older and took on new responsibilities I was forced to leave my village. First I went to university, and then to the big city to earn an income for my family. Over time the longing for the natural world grew inside me, but it wasn’t until about 5 years ago that I finally had to act.When my daughter was born I decided that if it was impossible for us to leave the city, I must bring the beauty of nature to my daughter. So began a 3-year journey to create the best indoor garden I could design.One day I noticed my daughter playing with her favorite toys – “building blocks.” In that moment I realized that indoor gardens could be so much more than just a bunch of pots. By allowing you to stack and expand your pots everyone can create a unique garden just like my daughters unique building creations.The Lego-like design has the added benefit of fitting into smaller spaces like our apartment. However, it also provides flexibility, so that my daughter can move and expand her garden as she grows. Once I began to design the pot I realized that this garden could be so much more. I noticed that indoor gardens could be quite messy! This is because of the multiple ventilation holes on the bottom of traditional pots, allowing excess water and soil to get everywhere. So as I designed our planter pots I added an internal water reservoir that can capture the excess water and an elevated ventilation hole to reduce soil escape.With the mess taken care of, I quickly realized that we needed to improve the lighting in our apartment if we wanted anything to grow to its fullest. My wife and daughter were particularly keen on succulents and would often leave them on the windowsill to get light, yet that still was not enough. So I set about to design a lighting fixture that could provide for multiple plants at once and have an automatic shut off so they don’t get too much light.At this point things were going well and our plants were getting better, but some still continued to struggle. After some research I realized that many plants require moisture in the air to thrive.Instead of buying an off-the-shelf humidifier I decided to create something beautiful, compact, and would match our building block concept. This provided an especially difficult challenge for me and it took 23 designs before I finally created a 360° diffusing mist humidifier.Not only do our plants get the moisture they need, but it also provides additional health benefits. My eyes are less stressed and I sneeze far less often when I work next to the humidifier. At this point our garden system was shaping up to be a beautiful, easy-to-use masterpiece, but there was still one more thing I wanted to do.Since I spend countless hours at the office I wanted to add some greenery to my desk. Our system works perfectly for workspaces, but one day I thought ‘wouldn’t it be cool if I could charge my phone with the plant on my desk?’ I immediately started working on our Power Pot. This mini power hub has 4 USB ports, so that it can power the LED lamp and humidifier, plus my phone and tablet.It wasn’t until we completed the Power Pot prototype that I realized how incredibly convenient it truly was. Any desk, end table, or counter can now have a beautiful plant and a quick-charge station!This whole project over the past 3 years has been an amazing experience. Not only was the LeGrow Smart Garden born, but also, I was able to spend quality time with my daughter planting, growing, and expanding our home garden. Now we hope to share this experience with you.The money we raise here on Kickstarter will provide us with the capital necessary to start full production of the LeGrow Smart Garden. We hope someday it can help millions of people reconnect with nature and grow something beautiful. Thank you!     
 LeGrow’s Smart Garden lets customers pick and choose what their eco-system looks like, design and build it, then watch it grow.

LeGrow Humidifier - The missing link to growing plants. The #1 cause of plants dying indoors is from lack of moisture in the air. This could be from heating, air conditioning, or a desert environment. LeGrows compact, beautifully designed humidifier adds moisture to the air and also acts as a water storage device for convenience. Small but powerful, this humidifier can release more than 30 ml of water per hour for up to 6 hours. It automatically shuts off when out of water and will resume when refilled. A must-have for all indoor plant enthusiasts. What's more, having a humidifier indoors can improve the air that you breath too, benefiting your lungs, overall health, and even reducing dry skin.

LeGrow Power Pot - Combining nature with modernity. Say goodbye to ugly power sockets and cables, and instead charge your smart phones, tablets, or any other USB-powered device via your plants. The power pot is equipped with 4 USB ports (DC 5V, 36W total output power, input voltage 100-240V AC) that support fast charging, and are waterproof so you can water your plants while you charge. A smart switch allows you to turn the power on when inserting a growing pot on top of the power pot. A great accessory for any workspace.
Base Growing Pot - This is where your garden starts. The base pots can be stacked or connected together with base trays to keep your garden clean and tidy. Using silicon connectors you can stack the pots as high as you want, and in fun designs. Each pot is 8.5cm by 8.5cm and is designed to retain up to 30 ml of water, allowing you to water less often.
We hope that through the Smart Gardens flexibility and add ons, growing plants indoors will become easier and fun. LeGrow has designed a simple system that allows you to grow what you want, where you want. We believe that by bringing nature indoors you will be able to reap the benefits that plants can provide us. From reducing stress and anxiety levels, improving air quality and oxygen levels, to even making us more productive and sharpening focus, the benefits are endless.

All products over $25 are subject to duties and GST or VAT tax.Here's a link to find the CBSA offices where you can actually go and do the clearance, and save some significant dollars: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/do-rb/services/lvs-e... In addition, our invoices are in U.S. dollars.Finally, we also will NOT mark any package as a “GIFT”… this is illegal so we will not do this.Risks and challengesWe expect to fulfill orders by June/July of 2017...Physical products can be a long-winded and bumpy process without prior experience and effective communication.Fortunately, each team member has helped launch multiple successful Kickstarter Campaigns.We know the drill.We will remain transparent and thorough in our updates; both DURING and AFTER the campaign.Our biggest challenge up to this point was anticipating delivery time... yet through multiple conversations with our manufacturers, we've 'over-anticipated' our potential order quantities, ensuring that our partners can manufacture, package and ship on time.Sleep ultimately affects every part of our life... and it's important that we keep it important. Our dream is to create products that promote cleanliness and comfort, integrating cutting edge technology to do it. We're passionate about this and hope that you can help us in realizing our vision!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have been in the nursery/lawn and garden industry for almost 30 years and have developed several unique products and hold 3 patents and several provisional patents in the industry. Thanks for looking at my project, because I am going to fix a problem for you if you have a cat.  </p>
<p><strong>All you need is a covered cat box, a house plant, and I can <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">completely eliminate</span> litter box odors in your house without harmful sprays, fancy equipment and only using the least expensive litter available (oh, you also need the cat).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Low voltage power supply for saftey, uses between 3 and 12 watts. annual opperating costs are about $6.00.  Pump noise is almost undetectable. </strong></p>
<p><strong>See my video on the gallery tab top right over cat cover picture!! (I'm a litte awkward behind the camera, it is not my thing.)</strong></p>
<p>I can do this by using a natural air cleaning process that NASA researched for more than 30 years to improve interior air quality for space travel. This process cleans harmful contaminates from the air (VOCs) using plants and the beneficial bacteria/enzymes living in the plants roots system. Its called <strong>Phytoremediation</strong>.</p>
<p>I also have a patent pending irrigation system called SELFWTR that makes this air cleaning process effective and inexpensive on a small consumer scale or on a larger scale for commercial buildings.</p>
<p><strong>How <strong>Purrfect Air™</strong> came to be:</strong></p>
<p>I am a co-founder of AgroSci Inc., a startup company, which has developed this product. I was working in my home office, which is just fine “usually”, but unfortunately for me the only space available was a little room in the back of the house. This room also had the litter box. This was pretty awful and I was not happy about it. At the same time, I was working on a commercial scale system to clean indoor air using green walls and our SELFWTR irrigation system when it hit me!</p>
<p>While sitting in my cloud of toxic litter box odor, a light bulb went off in my head! Why not use our mini-SELFWTR system with one of my house plants and get rid of the stink using <strong>Phytoremediation</strong>? After 3 hours of tinkering I had a workable prototype ready to go. I got it running and it was nothing short of a miracle. I know this is a little sad but this system changed my life! Within 15 minutes most of the odors were gone and by the end of the day you could not tell there was a cat box in the room.  After all the room air freshener sprays, plug in air fresheners, expensive cat litters, (all of which are very bad for you and the cat), here was a clean natural solution to this problem. <strong>Purrfect Air™ actually cleans 1500 gallons of air a day! </strong>So not only was the smell gone but the air quality in the room was dramatically improved.  I knew then that I had to share this with the world...and this is where <strong>you</strong> come in.</p>
<p><strong>What I need, what you get:  YOU GET RID OF THE STINK FOREVER!</strong></p>
<p><strong>**If campagne goal is not met Rewards will still be filled, we have wholesale orders for Purrfect Air now and will still ship product in March, your participatation will still make a big difference with this product introduction!!**</strong></p>
<p><strong>So be the first to get a Purrfect Air System of your own!!</strong></p>
<p>I am looking at this crowd funding a little differently than perhaps other startup campaigns that you have seen. I have spent many hours in front of bank lenders, venture capitalists and state organizations with some success but....</p>
<p>For this project I want to go right to you. I know this is a big problem in a big market. I want to raise $30,000 by giving great rewards and get this system to you at a great value (25% below retail). Yes, we will have tee shirts, we have even offered our mini-SELFWTR system as a reward (My Lazy Gardener). But I want all you cat owners to see how powerful this air cleaning method is and how easy it is to operate. And <strong>Purrfect Air™</strong><strong> </strong>will save lots of money and pay for itself many times. Then if I need more funds, I will be able to say, see, these are the people that supported this. You can validate our <strong>Purrfect™ Air Litter Box System</strong> by supporting our project and getting a green healthy solution to this problem for your own home.  </p>
<p>I discovered many things while working on this project about the fragrance industry. Mostly I discovered that what they are selling us is really awful and sometimes very dangerous, without regulation, anything can be put into these products. Acetone, butane, crystalline silica, propane, all these chemicals, known carcinogens, are used in these products. They do not even have to tell you what’s in the fragrance because there is no regulation that makes companies reveal them.  Your support will keep you, the cat owner, from using these products and help us finish the commercial product and move to the next project we have for cleaning indoor air.    </p>
<p>If you don’t have a cat but like what you see, every bit will help. So consider the smaller contribution rewards, and <strong>Purrfect Air™</strong> does make a great gift! You can also make a <strong>HUGE</strong> contribution by just passing this along to people you know who have a cat. Please tell your friends and thank you so much for your support!!</p>

Our bodies have little discs between our vertebrate – <i>sort of like jelly-filled donuts</i> - that act as cushions between the vertebrae. IVDD is when these discs become susceptible to bursting over time as the outer fibrous layer hardens and loses its elasticity.</p><p>Burst or bulging discs usually occur from hard impacts or injury, like from wrestling, jumping off or over things, doing stairs, etc. The offending disc can push on nerves or the spinal cord itself, causing severe pain and in some cases, paralysis.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526140632/uqfrvdeoley5k0lsipxg.png"" src=""""/></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526140896/xert65bfh0vaqtihjp8q.png"" src="""" style=""float:left;""/>This is why it is so important to ensure that a dog prone to IVDD avoids repetitive or hard landings from jumping off furniture or doing stairs.</b></p><p> </p><p>It’s always best if you can prevent a disc from bulging/bursting in the first place, because recovery is long and hard, and if paralysis occurs, surgery is usually the recommended course of action, which is very costly and stressful.</p><p><strong>Here are some good tips on how to prevent an injury:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Keep your dog strong! A strong back puts less stress on the discs themselves to absorb impacts.</li>
<li>Don’t let your dog do stairs! Here at Crusoe’s house, we have baby gates set up at the top and bottom of all staircases.</li>
<li>Use ramps for couches and beds. Like DoggoRamp! Hehe</li>
</ul><p>Crusoe underwent spinal surgery for a blown disc in August 2016 after he had gone ""wobbly"" in the back legs. It was a long, hard recovery process that we never want to go through again.

Pull rope tight, tie off to leg of ramp.
*Even if your bed does not have this setup, rope can be tied off to a post, loop over a footboard, as well as further configurations which we detail in our Setup Videos.

And that's all there is to it.A Word About Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)IVDD (intervertebral disc disease) is a condition that affects about 25% of dachshunds as well as some other breeds, especially those with longer backs. Our bodies have little discs between our vertebrate – sort of like jelly-filled donuts - that act as cushions between the vertebrae. IVDD is when these discs become susceptible to bursting over time as the outer fibrous layer hardens and loses its elasticity.Burst or bulging discs usually occur from hard impacts or injury, like from wrestling, jumping off or over things, doing stairs, etc. The offending disc can push on nerves or the spinal cord itself, causing severe pain and in some cases, paralysis.This is why it is so important to ensure that a dog prone to IVDD avoids repetitive or hard landings from jumping off furniture or doing stairs. It’s always best if you can prevent a disc from bulging/bursting in the first place, because recovery is long and hard, and if paralysis occurs, surgery is usually the recommended course of action, which is very costly and stressful.Here are some good tips on how to prevent an injury:
Keep your dog strong! A strong back puts less stress on the discs themselves to absorb impacts.
Don’t let your dog do stairs! Here at Crusoe’s house, we have baby gates set up at the top and bottom of all staircases.
Use ramps for couches and beds. Like DoggoRamp! Hehe
Crusoe underwent spinal surgery for a blown disc in August 2016 after he had gone ""wobbly"" in the back legs. It was a long, hard recovery process that we never want to go through again. I know the DoggoRamp will not only add convenience to people's lives, but help prevent other dog families from going through what we did.Risks & ChallengesBringing any product to market has its inherent risks and challenges.

Therefore, when this material is exposed to infrared radiation and the temperature rises, the surface charge will decrease, which is equivalent to releasing a part of the charge, so it is called pyroelectric. The discharged charge can be converted into voltage output by the amplifier.

We spent months researching the current market and determined to create something different. It should be an easy-to-carry item, and safe for living, as it is a UV-light. As well as easy-to-use. We finally decided to design it a one-button pocket-size powerful UVC light which has built-in a PIR human sensor sensitive to detect the human or animals to avoid the harm of UV-light to living creatures. Two UVC bulbs are powerful enough to clean the space where huge one can't reach.</p><p>This is not the first time to go crowd funding.

Even though we have a hard time to produce, test and ship, finally we go through every barriers and shipped the product to backers. We believe that with the experience, we can make this new ROCKUBOT MINI a better product and arrange the production and shipment well.

The spontaneous polarization decreases with increasing temperature, and the temperature drops to zero at the Curie point. Therefore, when this material is exposed to infrared radiation and the temperature rises, the surface charge will decrease, which is equivalent to releasing a part of the charge, so it is called pyroelectric. The discharged charge can be converted into voltage output by the amplifier. This is how the PIR sensor works.Say goodbye to huge spacious UVC light as its pocket size feature makes it anywhere.USB-C Port Fast Charging3 Modes - 5mins, 10mins, 20mins UVC WandROCKUBOT MINI is also designed with two modes, automatic mode and handheld mode. Under handheld mode, you can also just hold it to clean the knobs, toilet seats or those fancy utensils, anything anywhere.( Handheld mode, only one bulb will turn on to avoid direct exposure of user to UV-light).Testing ReportThe idea for ROCKUBOT MINI came to us while we travel around one day, and realized that we can have a better safe way to clean our surroundings. We spent months researching the current market and determined to create something different. It should be an easy-to-carry item, and safe for living, as it is a UV-light. As well as easy-to-use. We finally decided to design it a one-button pocket-size powerful UVC light which has built-in a PIR human sensor sensitive to detect the human or animals to avoid the harm of UV-light to living creatures. Two UVC bulbs are powerful enough to clean the space where huge one can't reach.This is not the first time to go crowd funding. With the experience of the ROCKUBOT UVC Robot, which over thousands of backers helped us to bring it come true. Even though we have a hard time to produce, test and ship, finally we go through every barriers and shipped the product to backers. We believe that with the experience, we can make this new ROCKUBOT MINI a better product and arrange the production and shipment well. As you can see from the pictures, the tools are ready for production, and this time we are trying to start mass production and ship in September.Production LineFulfillment & ShippingWe are planning to make the fulfillment on the September. The first batch is about 500pcs and the others will also be sent before the end of September.Risks and ChallengesWith our current production capabilities, we should be able to produce the units sold on Indiegogo in 2-3 months. We are still constantly receiving feedback from our testers, improving the product and adding more features to it as we go to make it even better! We have our manufacturers lined up, and our production team is waiting for our signal. We know what we're doing, and you should be confident that we will deliver what we promise when we say we will. We're deeply committed to and excited about delivering a high-quality and high-reliability robot, on time, that we know you'll enjoy for a long time to come. Should any issues come up, you can be confident we will handle them with transparency and the utmost care for you, our backers. Thank you for your support!

<div><br/></div>
<div>Secondly, some good news - even though our apartment was NOT insured, the building was. Which means the insurance agency will cover the costs of repeartion. Eletricity, gas, walls, ceilings and floors will be replaced at their cost, which is a HUGE relief.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We still do need money for beds, closets, clothes and other minor things so your money which you selflessly donated will be put to good use and will help us replace the things we lost in the fire. Thank you again for that, we are so grateful.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So with this good news, we will be closing the campaign as we feel the situation has changed and we would feel wrong to take more money. We can assure you, once again, the money we recieved will be put to good use.</div>

<div>Thank you again so much, forever in your debt, God bless you all.</div>

<h2>What is My DIY Budget</h2>
<p>
My DIY Budget is the first of its kind ""Do It Yourself"" home improvement project planning and management software product. For the first time home owners can plan, manage and showcase their DIY projects using the power of the computer and the power of sharing. My DIY Budget gives DIY project owners the first tools ever created for sharing real project costs from real projects done by real people.
</p>
<h3>Making a Difference</h3>
<p>
There are millions of home owners throughout the world who are self described DIYers. The My DIY Budget website is for them. Planning, managing and showcasing DIY projects on My DIY Budget is free. Browsing through projects hosted on My DIY Budget for inspiration is free. There are no websites on the Internet today that showcase DIY projects done by real people and provide the tools to plan and manage real DIY projects.
</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>
So far we have raised $2,965 of the $10,000 we need to raise by the end of April 2014. The money that we raise will be used for the equipment that we need to support the launch of the My DIY Budget website in May 2014.

<h3> </h3>
<p><i>Usability</i><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </b></p>
</div><p><b>Q: Does my device work with Keezel?</b><br/>A: Keezel works with every device that uses ""regular"" WiFi (802.11 family of standards) for internet connection. This means it works with smartphones, tablets, laptops, media players, smart TV's. Your brand is not important, as long as it can use WiFi internet.<br/><br/><b>Q: Does Keezel work without the premium service?</b><br/>A: Keezel also works without the premium VPN service. You can choose to use our basic service, which offers the same high level of encryption, but will operate at lower speeds and with less locations to choose from.<br/><br/><b>Q: Can I use my premium service on more than one Keezel?</b><br/>A: You can use your premium service (connect to worldwide locations at high speeds) on one of your Keezels at the same time. If you want to use two Keezels simultaneously with high speeds, you'll need premium service for both of them.<br/><br/><b>Q: Can I watch all movies, TV shows and sports games that I want with Keezel?</b><br/>A: Keezel does not ‘have’ or ‘offer’ online content. With Keezel, however, you can circumvent censorship and geographic restrictions by connecting to the country of your choice. Now you can use the internet as if you are there. For example: You are in Europe and want to watch the TV show you started at home in the US. It turns out to be unavailable in Europe. With Keezel you simply select the US and you can continue where you left off. <br/><br/><b>Q: Does Keezel work everywhere, even when my government restricts access?</b><br/>A: No, everywhere is just too much to ask :) First of all, you'll need a WiFi network for your Keezel to connect to. It will work in the vast majority of situations, but on rare occasions internet can still be restricted. Technically it is possible for network administrators to block many ports making connections difficult. However, we will make sure Keezel works in as many situations as possible. In addition, for VPN to work, your Keezel must be able to reach VPN servers, which some countries try and block. It can be a cat and mouse game, but our VPN partners are among the best in the world to help in offering server availability and top performance. </p><p><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Buying &amp; Shipping</i></span></p><div>

<p><b>Q: Where can I get it?</b><br/>A: Keezel is currently shipping but also still available for pre-order on our website:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Q: How about shipping fees, duties and taxes?</b><br/>A: Shipping, handling, fees, duties and taxes are added during the checkout process and depending on your country are between 10 USD and 40 USD. (For early backers: we used special shipping perks before. If you need help getting a shipping perk send us an email at support@keezel.co)</p>
<p><br/><b>Q: How will you know my shipping address?</b><br/>A: In the current checkout process you can leave your shipping address. For earlier backers: you should have received an email from us with instructions on getting a shipping perk. If you have not seen this or need help, please contact us at support@keezel.co. <br/><br/><b>Q: When will my Keezel ship?</b><br/>Keezels is currently shipping! If you order a Keezel now (available on our website at <a href=""https://keezel.co?utm_source=indiegogo%20button&amp;utm_campaign=link%20click"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://keezel.co</a>), you can expect your Keezel to ship within 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p><br/><i>Privacy &amp; Security</i></p>
<p><b>Q: You are talking about privacy &amp; security, what is the difference?</b><br/>A: Protecting your privacy means that other people can’t see what you are doing online. For example: when you use your smartphone on a WiFi network at work, in a hotel or in a coffee shop, others can see what you are doing and communicating. Providing security means that Keezel makes it difficult for malicious hackers, phishers and other intruders to steal your passwords, credit card information, your identity, etc. </p>
<p><br/><i>Technical<b> </b></i></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: What is Keezel VPN connection like?</b><br/>A: Keezel works with some of the best VPN providers in the world (LeVPN, PureVPN, ProXPN). Keezel combines these great networks and chooses the best available connection in the region you have selected, every time you connect! This way you'll get the most out of your connection.<br/><br/><b>Q: What are the advantages of Keezel compared to VPN software?</b><br/>A: Keezel works without installing software on your devices. Keezel is more secure because your device is never connected to the internet without an encrypted connection. Regular VPN software solutions always bear a risk before the connection is established and of information leakage in a side channel. Keezel also works with multiple devices simultaneously and on devices that don't allow software installation, such as screenless media players or corporate laptops.<br/><br/><b>Q: Can I use my own VPN service with Keezel?</b><br/>A: We believe that the Keezel service is the best VPN solution available. We want to keep it as simple as possible. There is no option to configure other VPN services. However, we are cool with people who want to flash their own OS on their Keezel.</p>
<p><br/><i>Other</i></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Why won't Keezel to Keezel (stretch goal 1) be included in the basic service?</b><br/>A: We will have to keep a service running so the Keezels can connect each other, therefore we can’t afford to include it in the basic service.<br/><br/><b>Q: Does Keezel to Keezel (stretch goal 1) require both devices to have an internet connection?</b><br/>A: Yes. With Keezel to Keezel both devices need an internet connection to establish a connection. <br/><br/><b>Q: I'd like to blog or write a bigger story about Keezel. Where can I find more material or a press kit?</b><br/>A: Great! You can find our press page (press kit, media kit) with a press release, photos, video and more information right here: <a href=""https://www.keezel.co/press"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.keezel.co/press</a><br/><br/><b>Q: Will you be able to pull this off?</b><br/>A: We are currently shipping Keezels to our customers. Right now Keezels have been used in over 100 countries. We are working hard to get all Keezels delivered.</p>

Dangers of public WiFi

Using the Keezel
 

Free WiFi is everywhere and people love it. Nevertheless, every time you connect to WiFi you expose yourself to identity theft and data leakage. Also, did you know that your colleagues at work can see when you are chatting on Facebook on your phone when on the company network? 

Simply connect to your personal Keezel WiFi and you are good to go! You don't need to install any software. Now all your devices can enjoy increased privacy, security, and online freedom. Even those without screens such as your Chromecast, Roku, Sonos etc. 

Keezel protects your privacy, security and clients' information, while using the Internet in coffee shops, hotels and airports. It encrypts your connection on all connected devices without you having to install a thing. 

Episodes of your favorite show may all of sudden be unavailable when travelling. Or you might want to watch a sports game or a race and find that you can’t access it from your country or region. To fix this, all you need to do is connect your Keezel to a server in the country of your choice and enjoy the Internet as if you are actually there. Keezel is also useful for circumventing online censorship of Facebook, Twitter and other websites.  

The Keezel’s powerful battery has a capacity of 8000+ mAh, which is almost four times the capacity of an iPhone 6s. Use your Keezel to charge other devices on the go.
 

How it works
 


The Keezel was designed with simplicity in mind. We want to make good encryption available to just about everyone. The device whips up a secure connection for you in just 3 steps, and can be easily configured via an intuitive web app that can be accessed from any browser on any device. 
 

 
Here's a video showing you how easy it is to set up a secure connection.

Q: Why won't Keezel to Keezel (stretch goal 1) be included in the basic service?A: We will have to keep a service running so the Keezels can connect each other, therefore we can’t afford to include it in the basic service.Q: Does Keezel to Keezel (stretch goal 1) require both devices to have an internet connection?A: Yes. With Keezel to Keezel both devices need an internet connection to establish a connection. Q: I'd like to blog or write a bigger story about Keezel. Where can I find more material or a press kit?A: Great! You can find our press page (press kit, media kit) with a press release, photos, video and more information right here: https://www.keezel.co/pressQ: Will you be able to pull this off?A: We are currently shipping Keezels to our customers. Right now Keezels have been used in over 100 countries. We are working hard to get all Keezels delivered.

 There's no installation, no cords, no wiring, and no drilling! You can set Reolink Argus on a shelf, a table, a tree, or other flat surfaces, mount the camera to the wall, put it under the ceiling, or place it anywhere you want, like in the monitoring place that has no network cables and no power outlets. You can move it from room to room, and use it for watching a home, keeping an eye on the elderly, babies, kids, nannies, checking on pets, etc.Innovative Design (Skins and Mounts)The camera itself is well-designed, and you can add more personalities and possibilities with Reolink Argus skins, mounts and more accessories. All now are available on Reolink. You can also win the skins and mounts in our Facebook FOR FREE:Blend, wrap, curl or hang to make your Reolink Argus fit in perfectly your baby's room.An ideal durable full suit (3 colors) for any outdoor and indoor environment, stylish or rugged.The powerful cutting-edge 360° wall mount easily snaps on Reolink Argus with magnetic mounting. And you can twist the camera in any direction, even upside down. Move your Reolink Argus from one place to another whenever you wish. Reolink Argus is a standalone product and also an all-in-one security solution with a Full HD camera, a smart sensor, and alarms. It is battery-operated and features WiFi support. Generally, the camera will go into a standby mode and it will wake up immediately via motion detection and live view from a phone.  
Wake Up When Motion Is DetectedThe smart PIR movement sensor will detect if anything's wrong and whenever motion detection is triggered, the camera will wake up at once, capture the event and guarantee that you know it immediately. When the PIR sensor detects everything is sound and safe, the camera will go into a standby mode, which uses little battery power.
Send Smart & Accurate Alerts in Real TimeWhen motion is detected, the camera will inform you in real time with alerts.
Live View from Anywhere, AnytimeYou can also get live view of the camera from your phone anytime and anywhere. Even when you are on the go and even thousands of miles away from home, just a tap on your phone and the camera will wake up at once for live streaming. You can see clearly what's happening.
Listen and Talk BackOn the live view, you can not only see clearly what's happening, but also listen and even talk back. Welcome your kids home, tell your dog to get off the couch, and even warn verbally any uninvited! Why Reolink Argus?Traditional wireless security cameras only solve the ""messy cabling"" issue. But for monitoring an area without cords and power outlets, there has to be an 100% wire-free battery-powered security camera!“Inspired by a customer, who was frustrated by running wires to a power outlet to monitor his baby, we decided to create a wire-free battery-powered camera.” Said Colin Liu, the CEO of Reolink. “As a father of two kids, I’ve also been thinking about keeping an eye on my own children without dealing with the hassle of wires, as well as covering the whole area of the baby’s room. That’s why Reolink Argus was created.”After a long-term hardworking of the team, now Reolink Argus is well developed. You can use it in any place for wire-free surveillance and protection, like
Temporary construction site watch
Keeping eyes on the kids/pets
Watching over your grandma/grandpa
Surveillance around the house

Leaving for an extended vacation
Security for rentals
Surveillance in the front/back yard
 Weatherproof -- Never QuitWeatherproof design makes it work in a wide variety of harsh weather conditions, including rain, snow, intense cold and heat. The IP-65 certified weatherproof camera braves it all, and has no limited placements. You can put it outside or inside.

<p><span style="""">The Human Rights Organization for Transparency and Peace (HROTP) in a non government organisation that provides free legal advice and assistance for disadvantaged Khmer people. HROTP represents human rights interests and anti-corruption issues, acting as a nonpartisan liaison group between the government and the Khmer people. As a group HROTP assists in a wide range of human rights cases, ranging from human trafficking and rape to enabling rural people have access to medical care in Phnom Penh and housing development projects for the underprivileged. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">In the late 1970s the Khmer Rouge banned private property, destroying thousands of land documents. As a result, many Cambodians lack the proper land titles to the property they own. This often results in the illegal sale or eviction of people from the lands that they rightfully own. The Cambodian government has been selling Cambodian people’s land to foreign investors for monetary gain with little regard for the land rights of the Cambodian people, taking away their homes and their livelihoods with little to no compensation. According to the rights group Licadho in 2013, 400 000 people have been affected by land grabbing and land disputes since 2003.</span></p>

This meant that they have had to rely on donations of food from the local villagers, creating a strain on an already impoverished community. The land on which they live now is rocky and largely infertile, so they are unable to even grow their own food. </span></p>

The Human Rights Organization for Transparency and Peace (HROTP) in a non government organisation that provides free legal advice and assistance for disadvantaged Khmer people. HROTP represents human rights interests and anti-corruption issues, acting as a nonpartisan liaison group between the government and the Khmer people. As a group HROTP assists in a wide range of human rights cases, ranging from human trafficking and rape to enabling rural people have access to medical care in Phnom Penh and housing development projects for the underprivileged. 
In the late 1970s the Khmer Rouge banned private property, destroying thousands of land documents. As a result, many Cambodians lack the proper land titles to the property they own. This often results in the illegal sale or eviction of people from the lands that they rightfully own. The Cambodian government has been selling Cambodian people’s land to foreign investors for monetary gain with little regard for the land rights of the Cambodian people, taking away their homes and their livelihoods with little to no compensation. According to the rights group Licadho in 2013, 400 000 people have been affected by land grabbing and land disputes since 2003.

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Hi there! My Name ist Alex. I am a mechanical engineer, a passionate diver and survival fan for more than 12 years. Since then I was looking for the perfect lamp to brighten up my adventures under water and above. Until now I was not able to find a lamp that would be able to match all of my needs. Some were bulky and clumsy whilst others simply did not have enough power. There was basically only one possible solution: ""Do it yourself"". With Michael, a specialist in LED lighting from the German company <a href=""http://www.koelnled.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KölnLED</a>, I sat together and planned the creation of this ""one"" lamp!</p>
<h3>What are our plans?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to build a lamp that outshines every single lamp on the market concerning power, functions and quality whilst at the same time still being affordable. The image you see above is our first design-concept and will hopefully not differ much from our final product. You can see the main specifications and functions in the following passage:</p>
<h3>Specs and functions</h3>
<ul>
<li>7x LED with up to 7280 Lumen</li>
<li>LCD Display that shows the battery lifetime and brightness</li>
<li>Rechargable batteries with 3Ah (larger ones in preparation)</li>
<li>One-Hand-Control for regulating the lamp</li>
<li>Multiple steps to adjust the brightness</li>
<li>SOS-Function</li>
<li>Replacable color filters for underwater fotography</li>
<li>Very light aluminium case in different colors</li>
<li>Usable underwater and above</li>
<li>Different lenses(10°, 25°, 40°) selectable (must be choosen during order)</li>
<li>Hook and eye for attaching the lamp</li>
<li>Easy to hold (2 Kg)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparison with other lamps</h3>
<p><img alt=""English Comparison"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.koelnled.de/Images/X7000/Beleuchtungsst%C3%A4rke_Englisch.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""English Comparison""/></p>
<h3>Why do we need your support?</h3>
<p>A perfect product should match the need of every single customer and it is in our interest to create such a premium-quality device. I would love to say that German engineering skills itself guarantee the success of this project, but in fact it is not help in financing. After spending a long time and passion on this lamp, we feel the urge to finish what we once began and share our results with you! Until the day of completion you are invited to support us with your ideas, advice and donations!</p>
<h3>What can we offer you?</h3>
<p>Every donor receives our greatest possible appreciation! Unfortunately we can not send a lamp to every donor, which is the reason for grading the perks you receive. Regardless of the amount you donate, you will be named in the ""book of supporters"" which comes along with every lamp.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>How long do the batteries last?</h4>
<h4><em> That depends on how bright you like it. With maximum power (7000 Lumen) and the small battery package the lamp will burn for one hour. Under normal conditions (1000 - 1500 Lumen) the lamp can be used for a few hours. </em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>When will the lamp be finished?</h4>
<h4><em> We are both full-time employees and can only work on the project in the evening. Since the concept is completed we hope to finish everything until the end of this year if financial support is given. </em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Can I use the lamp as a normal flashlight?</h4>
<h4><em> Yes! The lamp was built for underwater purposes but can as well be used above sea level. An integrated controller will measure the temperature and in case of an emergency decrease the brightness to stop overheating. </em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Which accessories do I get?</h4>
<h4><em> In the basic package you will receive the lamp, the charging station and a nylon bag. Additionally the following accessories can be purchased. Colorfilters (Color- and application suggestions desired), spare batteries (larger batteries in preparation) and a tough aluminium-suitcase which can hold all accessory parts. </em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>How do we keep you up to date?</h4>
<h4><em> All news on the lamp can be reviewed on this site. As soon as we progress in development we will inform you immediately ! We think of creating our own facebook site :) </em></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Can I influence or support the developpment in any way?</h4>
<h4><em> Yes! Simply send us your ideas and advice. We are pleased to hear from you! </em></h4>

<p>The campaign will lead to the creation of an extra ordinary clock that can both display and mechanically calculate the Easter Date of the Georgian Calendar. (<i>Roman Catholic Easter Date</i>). We, Archides Uhren in Salzburg, have created a project, that is dedicated to the 12 Apostles, however
...</p>
<p>this specific campaign at Indiegogo is dedicated to Saint Peter, also known as Simon Peter, leader of the early Christian Church; within the Roman Catholic Church considered as the first
Pope and founder of the Church in Rome.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Pope Francis is known to be charitable - and so are we. We guarantee that proceeds above the funding goal will be donated to charity. Please see FAQ's for our thoughts which project should be supported.</p><p><br/></p><div>
<h1>Brief historical Overview</h1>
<p>Since clocks started being made there are only a few clocks known capable of calculating Easter Date
mechanically; in his famous horological work ""Tractatus Astrarii"" Giovanni Dondi (1318 - 1389) described and illustrated a planetary clock with a calendar device indicating the Easter and other related feasts. Dondi
was the first to think about the possibility to calculate the Easter Date mechanically. Such computus can be found on the Strasbourg Cathedral astronomical clock. Jens Olson, a Danish engineer, implemented the Easter date
within his famous Astronomical Clock, which can be seen at Copenhagen City Hall. Patek Philippe<sup>TM</sup> constructed such computus on occassion of their 150th anniversary (Caliber 89). These are the best known examples so far.</p>
<p>All clocks have limitations concerning the duration of calculation without human intervention. The
biggest difference to our clock!</p>
<p>Religious clocks have been around since ancient times. As early as the epoch of clepsydras and gnomons,
resourceful clergy learned to adapt the time measuring instruments for the purposes of time-programmed control of religious ceremonial rites and rituals. The union of astronomy, religion and mechanics must still be seen as
the peak of clockmaking, that only a few men in history reached.</p>
<p>Today only a few clockmakers can meet the challenge of inventing something radically new in horology.
This requires an offbeat scientific and practical approach and profound knowledge of horology, past and present. Dozens of pages covered with complex mathematical and astronomical calculations testify to the enormous work
Konstantin Chaykin had to accomplish while developing this complication. It took him years to create the unique movement of the astronomical clocks ""Easter Time"". Konstantin Chaykin also created calendars for the
Orthodox Easter date, an Islamic and Jewish calendar.</p>

<h2> - The Clock Design</h2>
<p>The design is clearly from the 21st century and yet it is timeless. It is the Celtic symbol for Trinity
in a modern shape.</p>
<p>In any case, the clock presents itself as something special and at first sight stands out clear and
recognizable to all other clocks. All 14 pieces (see ""<i>The whole project</i>"") will be produced similarly, but have names and colour specific distinctions. Similarly the material (Olive wood and Makassar) of the clock case is special and symbolic.</p>
<p>Regarding the Celtic Trinity the three-part case was developed with a nicely curved line, that has
neither a beginning or an end. This refers subtly to TIME and its measurement. The wing elements represents visually the focus of the clock and are massively formed by 14 lamellae. These are 8 mm wide, and are symbolic of
the 12 Apostles and the two additional Evangelists.</p>
<blockquote><b>Each Apostle receives his own name engraving, on his special lamellae.</b></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1042350/files/20141124045330-03Aposteluhr01_transp.png?1416833610"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All indicators on the clock will be in latin, and so will the names of the Apostles: Simon Petrus,
Andreas, Iacobus Zebedaei, Iohannes, Philippus, Bartholomeus, Thomas, Mattheus publicanus, Iacobus Alphei, Thaddeus, Simon Cananeus and Matthias (<i>Acts 1:15-26</i>). The names are shown within the individual made lamellae.</p>
<p>Besides this explanation of the Celtic Trinity, the other kind of infinity symbol we can also see
with some fantasy - the fish. Again, there are three different ways to view this special design.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>The whole project - Apostle Clocks</h1>
<blockquote><b>(Please keep in mind, that the Saint Peter Clock is part of the whole Apostle Clock project, and only the Saint Peter Clock is refered to for this campaign.)</b></blockquote>
<p>The project, ""<i>Apostle Clocks</i>"", is based on the production of 14 clocks (12 certified Apostles Clocks and two prototypes named after the
two evangelists who are not Apostles (Lucas and Marcus) - these two men are symbolically represented within the design by the border lamellae. These two ""extra"" clocks will be used for show around the globe at interested
museums. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1042355/files/20141124045539-03Aposteluhr04_transp01.png?1416833739"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For obvious reasons we decided to create a project with the Apostles. The Catholic Easter Date, the
blessing urbi et orbi, the first Apostle Petrus and several other meaningful reasons made it obvious to donate the Petrus Clock to the Vatican. The other Apostle Clocks are favourable opportunities for people of faith and
art collectors. </p>
<p>To finance this project with a crowd-funding campaign, we wanted to keep the possibilities for all
to be part in this project and to glorify His Holiness Pope Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church - the Holy See, Primate of Italy,
Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. </p>

<h3>How will the products look like?</h3>
<p><b>The Postcard: </b>We have planned to create a motive according to the project - and it should combine somehow Rome, the Holy Father and the Saint Peter Clock. We will ask some artists to do it for us and therefore we can not describe it better at this time. On the back we will print some Thank you text and of course your address. When all is done, we will print the postcards in Salzburg, Austria, then we will travel to Rome, stick on Vatican stamps (hopefully we can organise stamps showing Pope Francis) and send them from Vatican State.</p>
<p><b>The Clock Book: </b>The book will cover the topics of the project, the design, the clock movement, and of course the Easter Date and its history. But we also include a chapter with the technical product description. Last but not least a chapter with the involved people and a chapter with all the supporters, individuals, institutions, associations and companies. (see Perks)</p>
<p>Example: [Individuals Chapter] - [Country] - John Doe, London. - In the same way we will list all other too.</p>
<h2>Others</h2>
<h3>Why should you support us?</h3>
<p>You will be part of an open, globally unique present for the Pope. The present itself will be unique too, to its functionality. We want to challenge the high research, development and design costs and show that community, innovation and passion can make this dream and project come true.</p>
<h3>What will we do with your money?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to fund the Petrus Clock as a present for the Pope. (We already have been given permission to bring the Holy Father the clock from his office.) As mentioned above, we want to be charitable, as the Holy Father is known.</p>
<p>Motivated by our own family we would like to give the extending funding to children. We would like to give it to a known organisation, to children and to an area which can not be supported enough in the next days - so we would like to give the surplus funds to SOS Children Villages appropriated to Syria.</p>
<p>We hope you will support this reasons and decision.</p>
<h3>Which amount will be donated to the charitable project?</h3>
<p>Our prime goal is to fund the Pope present. The proceeds above will be donated. The main costs of the project are already calculated, but depending on the Perks bought, some costs could still be calculated.</p>
<h3>Why have you founded an Association for this project?</h3>

The campaign will lead to the creation of an extra ordinary clock that can both display and mechanically calculate the Easter Date of the Georgian Calendar. (Roman Catholic Easter Date). We, Archides Uhren in Salzburg, have created a project, that is dedicated to the 12 Apostles, however
...
this specific campaign at Indiegogo is dedicated to Saint Peter, also known as Simon Peter, leader of the early Christian Church; within the Roman Catholic Church considered as the first
Pope and founder of the Church in Rome.

Therefore , the sole location of the „Saint Peter Clock” will be in Rome! – The one person responsible for it – is the Pope!


Participate in Pope Present is the title, and it should be your passion to make it happen.
Pope Francis is known to be charitable - and so are we. We guarantee that proceeds above the funding goal will be donated to charity. Please see FAQ's for our thoughts which project should be supported.
Brief historical Overview
Since clocks started being made there are only a few clocks known capable of calculating Easter Date
mechanically; in his famous horological work ""Tractatus Astrarii"" Giovanni Dondi (1318 - 1389) described and illustrated a planetary clock with a calendar device indicating the Easter and other related feasts. Dondi
was the first to think about the possibility to calculate the Easter Date mechanically. Such computus can be found on the Strasbourg Cathedral astronomical clock. Jens Olson, a Danish engineer, implemented the Easter date
within his famous Astronomical Clock, which can be seen at Copenhagen City Hall. Patek PhilippeTM constructed such computus on occassion of their 150th anniversary (Caliber 89). These are the best known examples so far.
All clocks have limitations concerning the duration of calculation without human intervention. The
biggest difference to our clock!
Religious clocks have been around since ancient times. As early as the epoch of clepsydras and gnomons,
resourceful clergy learned to adapt the time measuring instruments for the purposes of time-programmed control of religious ceremonial rites and rituals. The union of astronomy, religion and mechanics must still be seen as
the peak of clockmaking, that only a few men in history reached.
Today only a few clockmakers can meet the challenge of inventing something radically new in horology.
This requires an offbeat scientific and practical approach and profound knowledge of horology, past and present. Dozens of pages covered with complex mathematical and astronomical calculations testify to the enormous work
Konstantin Chaykin had to accomplish while developing this complication. It took him years to create the unique movement of the astronomical clocks ""Easter Time"". Konstantin Chaykin also created calendars for the
Orthodox Easter date, an Islamic and Jewish calendar.

The Clock
 - The Clock Movement

1 month duration

Vibration frequency of the balance 18.000 bph
Hour, minute, and second indication 

Perpetual Calendar (displaying the date, month, as well as the days of week, the year and the leap year

Lunar pahses indication
Leap year display
Easter Date display with one hand
Power reserve indicator
Replacement part for the disc change in about 100 years





 - The Clock Design
The design is clearly from the 21st century and yet it is timeless. It is the Celtic symbol for Trinity
in a modern shape.
In any case, the clock presents itself as something special and at first sight stands out clear and
recognizable to all other clocks. All 14 pieces (see ""The whole project"") will be produced similarly, but have names and colour specific distinctions. Similarly the material (Olive wood and Makassar) of the clock case is special and symbolic.
Regarding the Celtic Trinity the three-part case was developed with a nicely curved line, that has
neither a beginning or an end. This refers subtly to TIME and its measurement. The wing elements represents visually the focus of the clock and are massively formed by 14 lamellae. These are 8 mm wide, and are symbolic of
the 12 Apostles and the two additional Evangelists.
Each Apostle receives his own name engraving, on his special lamellae.


All indicators on the clock will be in latin, and so will the names of the Apostles: Simon Petrus,
Andreas, Iacobus Zebedaei, Iohannes, Philippus, Bartholomeus, Thomas, Mattheus publicanus, Iacobus Alphei, Thaddeus, Simon Cananeus and Matthias (Acts 1:15-26). The names are shown within the individual made lamellae.
Besides this explanation of the Celtic Trinity, the other kind of infinity symbol we can also see
with some fantasy - the fish. Again, there are three different ways to view this special design.

The whole project - Apostle Clocks
(Please keep in mind, that the Saint Peter Clock is part of the whole Apostle Clock project, and only the Saint Peter Clock is refered to for this campaign.)
The project, ""Apostle Clocks"", is based on the production of 14 clocks (12 certified Apostles Clocks and two prototypes named after the
two evangelists who are not Apostles (Lucas and Marcus) - these two men are symbolically represented within the design by the border lamellae. These two ""extra"" clocks will be used for show around the globe at interested
museums. 


For obvious reasons we decided to create a project with the Apostles. The Catholic Easter Date, the
blessing urbi et orbi, the first Apostle Petrus and several other meaningful reasons made it obvious to donate the Petrus Clock to the Vatican. The other Apostle Clocks are favourable opportunities for people of faith and
art collectors. 
To finance this project with a crowd-funding campaign, we wanted to keep the possibilities for all
to be part in this project and to glorify His Holiness Pope Francis, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church - the Holy See, Primate of Italy,
Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Sovereign of the Vatican City State, Servant of the servants of God. 
Persons Involved


Konstantin Chaykin (Owner of Konstantin Chaykin Manufacture in Moscow, Russia and owner of 38 patents. Member of the famous AHCI) created a mechanical calculus (patent pending) hand in hand with a
perfect moon and a perpetual calendar - first human interaction is needed on February 29th 2100, and than again 200 years later. 





His invention was the reason why we (Archides Uhren GmbH in Salzburg) wanted to create a special clock
for the Holy Father - with an appropriate and matching design. This design was developed by Robert Blaschke (Owner & Creative Head of Raumbau Architekten Salzburg, Austria). Responsible for the design realisation will be Wolfgang Wochner (Owner of Josef Wochner GmbH & Co. KG in Heiligenzimmern , Germany).



The idea, the concept, and the organisation is done by Archides Uhren in Salzburg, respectively in
a legal form of a charitable association. (pictures from left: The brothers Klaus & Mag. Gerhard Messerklinger). Responsible for the idea and all words. 



Responsible for the treasury within the charitable association is lawyer and Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
RA Dr. Johannes Neumann (Junior Partner at PEHB - Pressl Endl Heinrich Bamberger Rechtsanwälte GmbH - Salzburg, Austria). Link to the Articles of Association and our promise. (Vereinsstatuten only in German).

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
Contributions, Payment, & Delivery

Can I donate direct?
Please see detailed informations on our homepage, resp. on the about | impress page.
How do I purchase another Apostle Clock?

When you choose Perk A - Reserve one of the other 11 Apostle Clocks, this only means that you have bought a reservation! and the right to choose from one of the Apostle names. We will work in the sense of: “first come, first serve principle.” You should contact us after buying this Perk, to reserve your name. We will also update regularly the list of the available names - so please see the update site.
According the the regulations on Indiegogo, we will an have fulfilled the agreement, by accepting the reservation. If - and only if, you don’t come up with the instalment plan, your reservation will be passed on to someone else.
For your better understanding: We, the Private Association “Saint Peter Clock” pass on the reservation to Archides Uhren GmbH. From that time all business activities are made by Archides Uhren GmbH in Salzburg, Austria. The amount paid at Indiegogo must be seen as donation and is therefore non-refundable.

Are there other payment to receive another Apostle Clock?

Yes, the payment in Perk A is only a reservation fee - or the part, which supports the amount of the Saint Peter Clock. There will be further payments. Approximately around 250 K US$, depending how many clocks will be ordered, if individual wishes are mentioned, and so on.
Please send us an Email and we will send you more detailed informations about this agreement and the payment plan.
 
Other Apostle Clock: What will happen when I don’t pay the further payments?
Then you will loose your payment. We will write to you several times, at least 3 times, but when the payments does not come, you will loose your payment. The payment at Perk A is a non-refundable payment! - if you does not come up the agreed goals.
Will there be added delivery costs or VAT? 
No, we have calculated all prices including these fees. The only added fee, the customs duty and if exist taxes in your country, will be added to the Apostle Clocks. But we will discuss this, as soon as you bought this Perk.
Will you keep me updated with the progress if I contribute? 

Yes! When you contribute to the Saint Peter Clock campaign we will ensure that you receive all the latest information about all project’s products as they progresses.

I had problems making a contribution, please help?  
If you faced problems when making a contribution, please check common contribution errors. (http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/...)
I made a contribution, but now I've changed my mind. Can I have my money back?
Contributions on Indiegogo are non-refundable according to the Indiegogo Terms of Use. (https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms).  A contribution is a transaction that takes place purely between the contributor, campaign owner and payment processor. Our Association does not refund any contributions made. Read more from the Indiegogo Help Center. (http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/...).
Availability & Products
When will you ship the products?
Assuming to the reached funds and the structure of the products bought, we will be delivering the first products in the first quarter of 2015. In any event, we will keep you updated on the schedule in our update emails.

Can the product features or specifications change before delivery?
As in any crowdfunding campaign, changes are possible. We reserve the right to make changes in described features, specifications, and delivery date estimates, and to introduce other features and functionality at a later date.
How will the products look like?
The Postcard: We have planned to create a motive according to the project - and it should combine somehow Rome, the Holy Father and the Saint Peter Clock. We will ask some artists to do it for us and therefore we can not describe it better at this time. On the back we will print some Thank you text and of course your address. When all is done, we will print the postcards in Salzburg, Austria, then we will travel to Rome, stick on Vatican stamps (hopefully we can organise stamps showing Pope Francis) and send them from Vatican State.
The Clock Book: The book will cover the topics of the project, the design, the clock movement, and of course the Easter Date and its history. But we also include a chapter with the technical product description. Last but not least a chapter with the involved people and a chapter with all the supporters, individuals, institutions, associations and companies. (see Perks)
Example: [Individuals Chapter] - [Country] - John Doe, London. - In the same way we will list all other too.
Others
Why should you support us?
You will be part of an open, globally unique present for the Pope. The present itself will be unique too, to its functionality. We want to challenge the high research, development and design costs and show that community, innovation and passion can make this dream and project come true.
What will we do with your money?

Our goal is to fund the Petrus Clock as a present for the Pope. (We already have been given permission to bring the Holy Father the clock from his office.) As mentioned above, we want to be charitable, as the Holy Father is known.
Motivated by our own family we would like to give the extending funding to children. We would like to give it to a known organisation, to children and to an area which can not be supported enough in the next days - so we would like to give the surplus funds to SOS Children Villages appropriated to Syria.
We hope you will support this reasons and decision.
Which amount will be donated to the charitable project?
Our prime goal is to fund the Pope present. The proceeds above will be donated. The main costs of the project are already calculated, but depending on the Perks bought, some costs could still be calculated.
Why have you founded an Association for this project?
Briefly. Crowd-funding is well known in Austria, but the government, respectively the financial legislation, have not respond to this internet business. This is why we founded an Association. We hope, that this circumstance will be changed in the near future.
My question wasn't answered in this campaign page, what to do?
If you have more questions or simply just want to know the Association and / or the company Archides (project coordinator) better, don’t hesitate to send us an (mailto: spc@gmail.com) visit our website at wordpress.com (http://paspc.wordpress.com) or the website of Archides (http://www.archides.at).

<p><img alt=""Mi Garden Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/MiGardenlogo.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mi Garden Logo""/></p>
<p>The Mi Garden is a self-contained, indoor grow system that allows anyone to grow fresh herbs, vegetables or flowers, regardless of the weather outside and regardless of any previous experience you’ve had growing plants. </p>
<h3><strong>Innovation</strong></h3>
<p>Technology has replaced the need for a ""Green-Thumb""!  This truly innovative, high quality, indoor grow system is not only push-button easy to operate, it's also affordable for everyone. And unlike the herb gardens that you often see for sale, this system is designed for real-world use to continuously produce an abundance of fresh food.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mi Garden System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/collage1.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""MiGardenCollage1""/></p>
The Mi Garden is a complete product with an integrated grow light, automatic watering system and an intuitive, easy to use micro-controller that handles all of the watering and light timing so that you can literally leave the system for days at a time and your plants will continue to thrive.
<p>The micro-controller interface was designed for ease of use and mistake free growing.  The left side of the controller allows you to choose from – Vegetables, Herbs, Flowers or Others and the right side allows you to set – Seeding, Growing or Ripening.  After those settings are selected, the system handles all of the hard work for you; you simply need to monitor water and nutrient levels occasionally.</p>
<h3><strong>What Will You Grow?  </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt=""Growing Vegetables"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/collage2.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mi Garden Growing""/></strong></p>
<p>We have been testing the system prototypes for many months and during that time we’ve grown everything from Flowers, to Herbs, Tomatoes, Lettuce and different types of Peppers.  And during this testing we’ve meticulously refined the system programs to produce the optimum growing conditions for the largest variety of plants.</p>
<p><img alt=""Seeds and Clones"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/collage3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mi Garden Plant Starting""/></p>
<p>With the Mi Garden, you can start with seeds or transplants and you can manipulate your plants into blooming multiple times per year as opposed to the single bloom cycle that occurs outdoors with natural sunlight.  This means fresh food all year long and this is all done at the push of a button.</p>
<p>After your plants have grown for a certain period of time and/or reached a certain height, you can simply select the “Ripening” option.  This forces the plants to start the cycle of blooming so that you have 100% control.    </p>
<h3><strong>Two Options  </strong></h3>
<p>The first is a unit that comes with a florescent grow light. This light works amazingly well but since it’s already mass produced, it’s a lower cost option and it’s much cheaper to replace.  The monthly electricity costs for this option will be no more than $4, depending on where you live.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mi Garden System Floro"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/collage4.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""MiGardenCollage2""/></p>
<p>The second, yet most innovative option is one that features a proprietary LED grow light.   By using LED's we're able to produce only the specific spectrum of light that plants need for photosynthesis.   This light can last for up to 7 years and it uses far less energy so it makes for a much more eco-friendly product.  The monthly electricity costs for this option are negligible, you will barely notice an increase.</p>
<p><img alt=""Mi Garden System LED's"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.smartfarmhydroponics.com/collage5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mi Garden w/ LED's""/></p>
<h3><strong>Design </strong></h3>
<p>This system has been designed to be minimalist yet modern, so that it can literally be the centerpiece of any room and fit nicely with almost any home décor.  Though the system can grow 6 plants up to almost 2 feet tall, it’s also compact enough to be easily tucked away into any small, or unused space.</p>
<h3><strong>Why This Project?</strong></h3>
<p>My goal with this project is pretty simple – Create a product that makes people happy, more self-reliant, and delivers more quality, ease of use and satisfaction than the user expected!</p>
<p>This isn’t just an idea or a concept that I’m asking you to back, this is something that I’ve backed with everything I have and that I believe in 100%.  I've put my heart and soul into getting this product to the point it's at and I truly believe that it's something people will love!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MISSIONBUS works with homeless and families near homelessness.</p>
<p>MISSIONBUS is a family team of 9 people that travel the country loving and helping people that live on the streets as homeless. The team has traveled 10,000+ miles from Boston to San Francisco in a school bus we converted with the help of friends and family into an rolling mission command center loving people all along the way in 19 major US cities experiencing significant homelessness. MISSIONBUS is raising funds to purchase an old farm house to rehab for local mission work and create a base station to run national missions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>MISSIONBUS needs a home base to coordinate local and national mission work.</p>
<p>MISSIONBUS is in need of a mission base to dock MISSIONBUS and need a base station for local Community work we do with families that are in need.  MISSIONBUS helps families get back on track after the struggles of the world have beat them down and created a chasm they just can't get out of on their own.  MISSIONBUS comes along side of the struggling family and we walk with them out of bondage into freedom.  We do whatever it takes to facilitate this process.  Provide a place to stay away from home as we rehab their home, organize their living spaces, do laundry, do dishes, help get normal processes working again.  The father is key in this process, restoration and recovery must come from the leader of the family.  We assist the father in this process through encouragement and establishing accountability throughout the family unit.</p>
<p><strong>How the money will be allocated:</strong></p>
<p>Purchase of the property and farm house              $17,000<br/>New well, plumbing, roof, inside repairs                 $16,000 </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>MISSIONBUS makes a difference in people's lives.</p>
<p>MISSIONBUS has traveled the country for the last two years and learned so much about people that live on the streets.  We have listened to their stories and spent time with them under the bridges, in the woods and on the streets.  Each one of them has a name and a unique story.  Our mission is to show people that they do matter and that someone does care about them.  Many of these stories start with normal families trying to make it in the world but as life happens many struggles lead to oppression and then depression.  Our team has a deep love for people to help them off of this path that can lead eventually to homelessness.</p>

Besides knowing you've helped MISSIONBUS restore families and love people on the streets of America, we are busy making some really neat perks for you to keep or give as gifts.  We are offering homemade custom Thank You cards, custom friendship bracelets, a music cd of live gospel music produced by the MISSIONBUS band.  You can also get a website for your family or business.  We will custom develop your site with additional options to search optimize the website for Google search.  


The Impact
MISSIONBUS makes a difference in people's lives.
MISSIONBUS has traveled the country for the last two years and learned so much about people that live on the streets.  We have listened to their stories and spent time with them under the bridges, in the woods and on the streets.  Each one of them has a name and a unique story.  Our mission is to show people that they do matter and that someone does care about them.  Many of these stories start with normal families trying to make it in the world but as life happens many struggles lead to oppression and then depression.  Our team has a deep love for people to help them off of this path that can lead eventually to homelessness.


Other Ways You Can Help
Help us get the word out!
Maybe you can't contribute but you have lots of friends that might be interested in our perks or mission.  Tell a friend about us and if they contribute to our mission, we will send you a friendship bracelet.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Decorate
the world with MagnaHang – the REVOLUTIONARY new tool for decorating with
ornaments, garland, ribbon, streamers and more.<br/><p></p><br/>MagnaHang ™
is a patent pending magnetic hanging apparatus that can be used to hang objects
in various fashionable occasions, the primary of which being holiday ornaments.
The product is a versatile hanger that
is magnetically attractive, and can be applied to any area that contains metal
including: drywall and paneling screws, nails, metal corners, door frames,
walls, ceilings, and so much more. With
the application of the additional Backer Magnet, MagnaHang can be applied to
non-metallic items such as: lampshades, curtains, table cloths, glass in
windows and doors, and pretty much whatever your creativity allows.<br/><br/><p></p><p><b><b><b>PRODUCT / TEAM MEMBERS<br/></b></b></b></p><b><b>
</b></b><p>John Glover – Former
small businessman, entrepreneur-inventor, patent holder and majority owner of
MagnaHang. Age 42. John resides in
Wildwood, New Jersey with his wife Celeste where they enjoy life with their
young daughter.</p>
<p>Scott Reese – He concurrently serves as the Strategic
Planner for MagnaHang. Age 56. As frequent flyer
of the United States, Scott lives in Vacaville, California with his wife Jeanie
where they raised their three children.</p><p>Michele Esposito - Currently, as small business owner with 25 years of Retail Management &amp; 10 years of  Information Technology Sales.  Michele is our Executive Assistant and lives with her family in Mays Landing, NJ. Age 53. <br/></p><p></p><p>MagnaHang’s
initial marketing will be directed towards the display of holiday decorations
and ornaments. The product can be used
for decorating Christmas trees as well as applying holiday decorations around
the home, office, or business in a wide variety of areas. MagnaHangs are safer than traditional ornament
hooks because they are more visible and will not embed themselves in carpet, as
what occurs with traditional ornament hooks that pose choking hazards to
infants, children and animals. A wide
variety of alternate, non-holiday uses for MagnaHang have been identified,
which will be marketed as well. These
applications include corporate branding items such as “365” decorations, easy
and invisible temporary hanging of privacy screens, room dividers, signs,
advertising banners and low-voltage accent lighting and more. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274563/files/20131222131901-IMG_1757.jpg?1387747141"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Other
year-round applications for MagnaHang include drying flowers, hanging vines for
plants, or for creating elegant ways to hang easily misplaced items such as:
keys, jewelry or eyeglasses. MagnaHang is a new way of decorating and
displaying items that are quick and easy to remove, relocate, and store. </p>
<p>Restaurants,
bars, retail stores, professional offices, hospitals, cultural halls, casinos,
department stores and classrooms can all be seasonally decorated with ease and
safety. Even better, no ladder is required
to place or retrieve MagnaHangs from high ceilings. This optional extension pole is in the development stages and is anticipated to be released soon.  MagnaHang is an elegant
tool designed to hang ornaments, ornamental advertising, product promotions,
warning signs, directional aid signs, decorations, picture frames, cards,
balloons, garland, lights, fabrics, paper advertisements, electrical cords,
posters, wreathes and so much more. </p>
<p>The
MagnaHang name and invention has been filed for patent and trademark
protection. The inventor of the
MagnaHang, John Glover, cultivated the idea with the desire to create and
develop a better, more attractive way to hang ornaments on the Christmas tree. In doing so, he found a method for hanging
ornaments, as well as other items, that provided additional
applications such as on walls, in doorways, and other places where a magnetic
connection can be utilized. The primary
product application is for hanging holiday decorative ornaments, especially for
Christmas and other holiday decorations. </p>
<p>Each
MagnaHang is made using a beaded brass rod that is attached to a barrel
that contains an embedded magnet. At the
opposite end, the wire hooks into the ornament or other objects to
be displayed. In between are decorative beads and collars to beautify the
device.  In the first application, the object to be displayed will most
likely be a Christmas ball or similar ornament. The MagnaHang is also provided with an
additional “Backer Magnet"" to increase the weight capacity, or to
establish a magnetic connection as with hanging on fabric, glass windows,
synthetic plants or “real” and artificial Christmas trees. <br/></p><p>Each MagnaHang is approximately 3 ½ inches long, and the "" Shortys"" are approximately two (2.0) inches long.  The bendable brass shaft is beaded
with typically 3-8 beads of varying styles and colors, depending upon the ball,
globe or ornament color being attached to it, or the season for which the
MagnaHang is intended (i.e. reds and pinks for Valentine’s Day, red’s and
greens for Christmas, etc.)</p><p></p><p><b>FUNDING </b></p>
<p>When the funding goal is met, MagnaHang will enabled to commit material suppliers and the dedicated fulfillment service,  sufficient to fulfill ""Perks"" for Indiegogo campaign supporters, as well as a residual inventory to initiate a conservative, well-managed marketing effort using social media and direct marketing professionals.  With successful funding of our campaign we can aggressively employ these such experts to
help MagnaHang proliferate to both domestic and global customers. </p>
<p>We
anticipate that our company will achieve maximum efficiency with the
achievement of successful funding, wherein we can employ hundreds and highly anticipated potentially thousands
of workers at multiple fulfillment centers within the US. </p>

will be introduced initially using social media, to include Pinterest, Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook.  However, as indicated under “Funding”, our
ability to accelerate needed growth will be greatly enhanced when our funding goal is met. Such enhancements include employing the services of professional
social media experts and direct marketing professionals. With the success of reaching our funding goal we can more aggressively employ said social media
experts and employ professional services of a direct marketing firm, Harvest Growth of Castle Rock, Colorado. We have developed a close relationship with Harvest Growth throughout the development of this product.  As
MagnaHang’s design and functionality becomes more commonplace, and the market
requires a lesser degree of education, our marketing emphasis can shift to
include marketing through the plethora of mail-order catalog companies and retail department stores. We anticipate continually producing and
releasing a string of promotional videos and commercials to keep the product and company fresh
and interesting. </p>

<p><b>OUR MISSION</b><br/><br/>
MagnaHang truly embodies a dream of an inventor, John Glover, and a group
of faithful  small investors who believe in the appeal this new product will
have by much of the world. Not only will
MagnaHang bring joy to its users and beauty to nearly every environment, it
will be priced affordable for most everyone. Altruistically, the MagnaHang
partnership is COMMITTED to creating jobs in the USA.   As such, we have
aligned ourselves with vendors throughout the United Sates to provide the
materials and services needed for manufacture and distribution. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274567/files/20131222132232-IMG_1783.jpg?1387747352"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>From materials to fabrication, assembly and
fulfillment, MagnaHangs WILL be a QUALITY American product that brings jobs and
revenue home to America through both domestic and global sales. Part of our vision is that we want to be the
“Zippo Lighter” of the decorating industry; well made, passed down from
generation to generation and guaranteed for life. And like Jelly Belly candies,
Hershey chocolates and Zippo, we’ll take pleasure in offering public tours of
our Manufacturing facility.  Finally, as fiscal strength grows sufficient, MagnaHang
will become a largely sincephilanthropic company that seeks opportunities to
contribute to helping the helpless and bringing solutions to the hopeless. Opportunities to do so are endless, and we
yearn for the time when we can do so. Indiegogo
enables value driven entrepreneurs, like us, to build and grow a product our
way, which we believe to be the right way.</p><p><b>Perks</b></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It's our pleasure to express our gratitude for pledges made on a variety of levels.  The following is an overview of how we anticipate expressing our appreciation; </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274559/files/20131222131429-Final_Perks_Edit.jpg?1387746869"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><b>$3 Contribution</b></li></ul><p>

traditional sense for decorating at Christmastime. The MagnaHang can be used on
artificial trees, since these have metal stems in their construction, or also
on live trees with the use of an additional Backer Magnet provided with each
MagnaHang unit. The product can also be used to hang ornaments onto garland
instead of using traditional bare-wire hooks. MagnaHangs also have uses in a
variety of alternative ways to provide additional decorating ideas for
consumers, to include but not limited to; </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274570/files/20131222132338-IMG_1815.jpg?1387747418"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>• <b>Walls</b> – Since most
walls contain studs with either nails or screws embedded under the drywall, the
product can be applied to walls without damaging tape, nails or tacks. In
addition, the brass rod can be bent and angled to personalize the
“presentation” of the decoration so that it hangs either perpendicular or on an
angle from the wall.</p>
<p>•  <b>Doorways</b> – In the
construction of many commercial buildings, metal is used in the construction of
doorways. This makes MagnaHang particularly attractive to commercial building
use such as office buildings, restaurants, retail shops, and others who
decorate their businesses for holidays and special events. </p>
<p>•  <b>Ceilings </b>– In both
commercial and residential structures, the MagnaHang can be used to decorate
from ceilings as well. In typical construction of homes, the heads of metal
nails used in securing the ceiling drywall enable the easy and secure placement
of MagnaHang without damaging the contact surface. </p>
<p>• <b>Commercial applications - </b>Many
office buildings and other commercial settings utilize dropped ceilings where
the MagnaHangs can be used to attach to the metal channels that facilitate the
dropped ceiling construction. Using an optional extension pole, placement
positioning and removal of MagnaHangs can be easily accomplished without the
need and added time and risk of using a ladder. </p>
<p>•  <b>Kitchen</b> – Many
consumers who enjoy entertaining also like to decorate their kitchen areas
since guests typically gather there for holiday dinners and parties.  The
kitchen offers many surfaces where MagnaHang can be used, such as on
refrigerators and along range ventilation hoods and window treatments. </p>
<p>•  <b>Fabric</b> – Since
MagnaHang can be enhanced with an additional Backer Magnet, the product can be
attached to drapery, curtains, tablecloths, lampshades and other fabrics in the
home, college dorm room, restaurant etc. </p>
<p>•  <b>Glass </b>–MagnaHang can
be “attached” to certain glass surfaces, such as windows in exterior walls and
doors as if glued to the surface.  This can be accomplished by having two
MagnaHangs “attached” to each other through the glass.  Or, if the
MagnaHang is wanted on only one side of the glass, the Backer Magnet provides
the needed polar balance.</p>
<p>•  <b>Plants </b>– Many homes
and offices use large potted plants for accents and decoration. The MagnaHang
can also be used to hang additional decorations during the holiday season. </p>
<p>•  <b>Recreational Vehicles</b>
– RV owners can especially benefit from MagnaHang as a solution for temporarily
installing seasonal lighting and decorations. MagnaHang is also an ideal tool
for quick and easy installation of low voltage lighting on the outside of RV’s,
to include Christmas lights and themed lighting. </p>
<p>•  <b>Other Holiday Applications
</b>– MagnaHang can be used with other holiday and celebratory events that are
traditional times for decorating. In the United States, holidays such as
Halloween, Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Independence Day and
Thanksgiving are traditional observances when American’s tend to decorate. </p>
<p>•  <b>Celebratory Event
Applications </b>- Decorators, event planners, event venues, and restaurateurs,
bar owners, and homeowners and renters alike will appreciate MagnaHang for
decorating their events with an even more festive appearance. Events such as
weddings, graduations, birthdays, anniversaries, Super Bowl parties as well as
corporate meetings all serve as occasions where seasonal or event-specific
colors can be easily facilitated by use of the MagnaHang. Most everyone
appreciates decorations, but most of us dread the task of decorating; MagnaHang
changes all of that dread to enjoyment as they are applied to any object where
a magnetic connection can be made</p>
<p><span>•<span> </span><span></span></span><b>Advertising Applications</b> - The
MagnaHang can also be used to by companies for advertising or display purposes.
For example, no more droopy and falling
vinyl banners!  A few MagnaHangs
used in-line will perfectly present a banner, temporarily or for the long term.
  MagnaHang can display business cards, signs, advertising cards, banners
or other objects in a new and attractive way.  Companies looking for a new and creative way to
show customer appreciation can do so by having its own logo custom imprinted
onto ornaments, such as a holiday ball.  Market studies have revealed that, regardless
of the theme, MagnaHangs frequently remain left in plain sight where they are
enjoyed year-round.</p>

</p><p><b>MARKET ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p>An informal market
analysis was conducted by MagnaHang’s inventor, John Glover. Said analysis
included showing prototypes to family, friends, and business colleagues as well
as interviewing over 1,000 prospective customers at a New Jersey mall. The feedback was a resounding “where can we
buy this?!!” </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274607/files/20131222134431-inventory-management-1.jpg?1387748671"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Participants of the test market who used MagnaHang at their homes have
commented that they are easy to use, especially “since there are no hooks,
tape, glue or nails to damage walls.” One evaluator reported back, “my kids
love this product and so does my wife”. Another
evaluator said; “I like them enough to leave ‘em up all year.” In the businesses where MagnaHang was donated
for test marketing, they were found to still be in place, and in view, over a
full year later. And such was the result
without prompting by the inventor who provided the prototypes. </p><p>Further, John Glover, inventor of MagnaHang met with four (4) marketing
firms, two of which are of the most prominent in the industry. One industry
expert indicated, in essence, “let me market them and I’ll show you $350M in
sales during the first year”. A second
industry expert, who also has a considerable reputation, expressed the same
enthusiasm, but estimated first year sales to be a more conservative $120M. Finally, another industry expert and
multimillion dollar businessman (manufacturing and fulfillment provider) said;
“if this product has a problem, it will be that it will be too popular,
everyone is going to want it, and managing the growth will have to be one of
the main focuses.</p><p> MagnaHang’s owners are dedicated to a business strategy that
will ensure the product is offered globally, but manufactured only in the
United States.  While its primary purpose
is to bring beauty and joy to all who take advantage of its unique features, we
anticipate a great degree of satisfaction will be achieved with the creation of
American jobs that are fueled by MagnaHang’s domestic AND global sales. </p>
<p>Since the company is
new and very small, the cost of materials and supplies to produce the MagnaHang
unit is high given the smaller orders of materials. In addition, due to a lack
of adequate operating financing, the company is limited in its options for
production quantities and thus higher sourcing costs for those materials. </p><p><b>TEST MARKETING </b>
</p><p>Establishing an
initial market will determine local brand awareness recognition efforts. Such efforts will also begin to establish the
test market required by the large companies that have expressed interest in the
product. </p><b>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION </b><p></p>
<p>Utility patents are
currently in “patent pending” status. Said
patents have been filed by Volpe and Koenig, P.C. of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, which is one of the nation’s leading patent firms. </p><p><b>COMPETITIVE MANUFACTURING </b></p>
<p>Similar to other products,
it is very difficult to compete with offshore manufacturing on cost. The
company believes that it will be able to compete with other low cost
decorations because of its patent pending design and be able to show that MagnaHangs
are a new and distinctive way to decorate for the holidays. They actually enhance the beauty and functionality of the already existing ornament market.  Further, each MagnaHang is laser inscribed to
validate its authenticity as a quality product and that it is manufactured in
the USA.</p><p></p><p><b>EQUIPMENT COSTS </b></p>
<p>Few dollars are
needed for capital investment initially, as MAGNAHANGS are hand manufactured. However, as sales volume warrants, automated
equipment is available that can increase capacity. Please see link to “ <a href=""http://www.Ciemmeo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Ciemmeo.com</a>
” to view a video of such equipment. Estimated cost of each unit is $50K.</p><b>LONG TERM CAPITAL</b>
<p>With adequate
financing, will be responsibly allocate funds to ensure growth both strategically and efficiency to maximize product while lowing our cost to maintain long term growth and profitability.</p><p> <b>IN SUMMARY</b></p><b></b><p></p>
<p>MagnaHang, as a company, has come a long way from concept to finished product.  The test market and industry response has been extremely favorable.  All that is needed to bring this product and its potential to life are ""seed funds"" sufficient to enable us to officially partner with designated vendors and barrel manufacturers to fulfill orders placed as a result of social media, catalogs and other proven forms of marketing.  Every indication points to the products success; adequate funding, combined with our unfailing commitment, will ensure it.  To all who share our vision and contribute to the dream, we offer our sincere and heartfelt appreciation. <br/></p><p></p><p>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/274608/files/20131222134544-Social_Credits.jpg?1387748744"" src="""" style=""width: 371.436px; height: 289px;""/></p><p></p><p>How to contact us: <br/></p><p>Call Michele Esposito directly 609-576-1070 Executive Assistant<br/></p>

the world with MagnaHang – the REVOLUTIONARY new tool for decorating with
ornaments, garland, ribbon, streamers and more.MagnaHang ™
is a patent pending magnetic hanging apparatus that can be used to hang objects
in various fashionable occasions, the primary of which being holiday ornaments.
The product is a versatile hanger that
is magnetically attractive, and can be applied to any area that contains metal
including: drywall and paneling screws, nails, metal corners, door frames,
walls, ceilings, and so much more. With
the application of the additional Backer Magnet, MagnaHang can be applied to
non-metallic items such as: lampshades, curtains, table cloths, glass in
windows and doors, and pretty much whatever your creativity allows.PRODUCT / TEAM MEMBERS
John Glover – Former
small businessman, entrepreneur-inventor, patent holder and majority owner of
MagnaHang. Age 42. John resides in
Wildwood, New Jersey with his wife Celeste where they enjoy life with their
young daughter.
Scott Reese – He concurrently serves as the Strategic
Planner for MagnaHang. Age 56. As frequent flyer
of the United States, Scott lives in Vacaville, California with his wife Jeanie
where they raised their three children.Michele Esposito - Currently, as small business owner with 25 years of Retail Management & 10 years of  Information Technology Sales.  Michele is our Executive Assistant and lives with her family in Mays Landing, NJ. Age 53. MagnaHang’s
initial marketing will be directed towards the display of holiday decorations
and ornaments. The product can be used
for decorating Christmas trees as well as applying holiday decorations around
the home, office, or business in a wide variety of areas. MagnaHangs are safer than traditional ornament
hooks because they are more visible and will not embed themselves in carpet, as
what occurs with traditional ornament hooks that pose choking hazards to
infants, children and animals. A wide
variety of alternate, non-holiday uses for MagnaHang have been identified,
which will be marketed as well. These
applications include corporate branding items such as “365” decorations, easy
and invisible temporary hanging of privacy screens, room dividers, signs,
advertising banners and low-voltage accent lighting and more. Other
year-round applications for MagnaHang include drying flowers, hanging vines for
plants, or for creating elegant ways to hang easily misplaced items such as:
keys, jewelry or eyeglasses. MagnaHang is a new way of decorating and
displaying items that are quick and easy to remove, relocate, and store. 
Restaurants,
bars, retail stores, professional offices, hospitals, cultural halls, casinos,
department stores and classrooms can all be seasonally decorated with ease and
safety. Even better, no ladder is required
to place or retrieve MagnaHangs from high ceilings. This optional extension pole is in the development stages and is anticipated to be released soon.  MagnaHang is an elegant
tool designed to hang ornaments, ornamental advertising, product promotions,
warning signs, directional aid signs, decorations, picture frames, cards,
balloons, garland, lights, fabrics, paper advertisements, electrical cords,
posters, wreathes and so much more. 
The
MagnaHang name and invention has been filed for patent and trademark
protection. The inventor of the
MagnaHang, John Glover, cultivated the idea with the desire to create and
develop a better, more attractive way to hang ornaments on the Christmas tree. In doing so, he found a method for hanging
ornaments, as well as other items, that provided additional
applications such as on walls, in doorways, and other places where a magnetic
connection can be utilized. The primary
product application is for hanging holiday decorative ornaments, especially for
Christmas and other holiday decorations. 
Each
MagnaHang is made using a beaded brass rod that is attached to a barrel
that contains an embedded magnet. At the
opposite end, the wire hooks into the ornament or other objects to
be displayed. In between are decorative beads and collars to beautify the
device.  In the first application, the object to be displayed will most
likely be a Christmas ball or similar ornament. The MagnaHang is also provided with an
additional “Backer Magnet"" to increase the weight capacity, or to
establish a magnetic connection as with hanging on fabric, glass windows,
synthetic plants or “real” and artificial Christmas trees. Each MagnaHang is approximately 3 ½ inches long, and the "" Shortys"" are approximately two (2.0) inches long.  The bendable brass shaft is beaded
with typically 3-8 beads of varying styles and colors, depending upon the ball,
globe or ornament color being attached to it, or the season for which the
MagnaHang is intended (i.e. reds and pinks for Valentine’s Day, red’s and
greens for Christmas, etc.)FUNDING 
When the funding goal is met, MagnaHang will enabled to commit material suppliers and the dedicated fulfillment service,  sufficient to fulfill ""Perks"" for Indiegogo campaign supporters, as well as a residual inventory to initiate a conservative, well-managed marketing effort using social media and direct marketing professionals.  With successful funding of our campaign we can aggressively employ these such experts to
help MagnaHang proliferate to both domestic and global customers. 
We
anticipate that our company will achieve maximum efficiency with the
achievement of successful funding, wherein we can employ hundreds and highly anticipated potentially thousands
of workers at multiple fulfillment centers within the US. 
MANUFACTURING
MagnaHang’s precision machined barrel is machined and laser
inscribed in the USA by contracted American vendors. The barrel and other components are pressed
and assembled together at a secondary location from where they will also be
shipped. 
MARKETING MagnaHang
will be introduced initially using social media, to include Pinterest, Twitter,
Instagram, and Facebook.  However, as indicated under “Funding”, our
ability to accelerate needed growth will be greatly enhanced when our funding goal is met. Such enhancements include employing the services of professional
social media experts and direct marketing professionals. With the success of reaching our funding goal we can more aggressively employ said social media
experts and employ professional services of a direct marketing firm, Harvest Growth of Castle Rock, Colorado. We have developed a close relationship with Harvest Growth throughout the development of this product.  As
MagnaHang’s design and functionality becomes more commonplace, and the market
requires a lesser degree of education, our marketing emphasis can shift to
include marketing through the plethora of mail-order catalog companies and retail department stores. We anticipate continually producing and
releasing a string of promotional videos and commercials to keep the product and company fresh
and interesting. 
ORDER
FULFILLMENT 
The ""order fulfillment"" arm of CAROBA Inc., is ready and committed to provide this service in the near and mid-term.  CAROBA's services and capabilites include staff for warehouse space, material management managers, and product assembly and order fulfillment. CAROBA has ample room and capacity for expansion if needed.  These services can be internalized by MagnaHang should it be determined to be most prudent.  
CUSTOMER
SERVICE Consumer acceptance and brand recognition are key to remaining
competitive. MagnaHang will stand behind
its brand and the quality of its product. Customer Service will be handled by
MagnaHang employees. Thus far, the
company has been able to rely on the help of friends and family to bring
MagnaHang to fruition. These wonderful
people are committed to the product, its management, and the virtually
unlimited possibilities it holds. MagnaHang’s ownership team is committed to
making this product a success while making the world a better place, and is
prepared to do whatever is legal and moral to see this simple yet amazing
product fulfill its potential and destiny. 
OUR MISSION
MagnaHang truly embodies a dream of an inventor, John Glover, and a group
of faithful  small investors who believe in the appeal this new product will
have by much of the world. Not only will
MagnaHang bring joy to its users and beauty to nearly every environment, it
will be priced affordable for most everyone. Altruistically, the MagnaHang
partnership is COMMITTED to creating jobs in the USA.   As such, we have
aligned ourselves with vendors throughout the United Sates to provide the
materials and services needed for manufacture and distribution. From materials to fabrication, assembly and
fulfillment, MagnaHangs WILL be a QUALITY American product that brings jobs and
revenue home to America through both domestic and global sales. Part of our vision is that we want to be the
“Zippo Lighter” of the decorating industry; well made, passed down from
generation to generation and guaranteed for life. And like Jelly Belly candies,
Hershey chocolates and Zippo, we’ll take pleasure in offering public tours of
our Manufacturing facility.  Finally, as fiscal strength grows sufficient, MagnaHang
will become a largely sincephilanthropic company that seeks opportunities to
contribute to helping the helpless and bringing solutions to the hopeless. Opportunities to do so are endless, and we
yearn for the time when we can do so. Indiegogo
enables value driven entrepreneurs, like us, to build and grow a product our
way, which we believe to be the right way.PerksIt's our pleasure to express our gratitude for pledges made on a variety of levels.  The following is an overview of how we anticipate expressing our appreciation; $3 Contribution

Estimated
delivery: Feb 2014The Impact
The product can be used in the
traditional sense for decorating at Christmastime. The MagnaHang can be used on
artificial trees, since these have metal stems in their construction, or also
on live trees with the use of an additional Backer Magnet provided with each
MagnaHang unit. The product can also be used to hang ornaments onto garland
instead of using traditional bare-wire hooks. MagnaHangs also have uses in a
variety of alternative ways to provide additional decorating ideas for
consumers, to include but not limited to; • Walls – Since most
walls contain studs with either nails or screws embedded under the drywall, the
product can be applied to walls without damaging tape, nails or tacks. In
addition, the brass rod can be bent and angled to personalize the
“presentation” of the decoration so that it hangs either perpendicular or on an
angle from the wall.
•  Doorways – In the
construction of many commercial buildings, metal is used in the construction of
doorways. This makes MagnaHang particularly attractive to commercial building
use such as office buildings, restaurants, retail shops, and others who
decorate their businesses for holidays and special events. 
•  Ceilings – In both
commercial and residential structures, the MagnaHang can be used to decorate
from ceilings as well. In typical construction of homes, the heads of metal
nails used in securing the ceiling drywall enable the easy and secure placement
of MagnaHang without damaging the contact surface. 
• Commercial applications - Many
office buildings and other commercial settings utilize dropped ceilings where
the MagnaHangs can be used to attach to the metal channels that facilitate the
dropped ceiling construction. Using an optional extension pole, placement
positioning and removal of MagnaHangs can be easily accomplished without the
need and added time and risk of using a ladder. 
•  Kitchen – Many
consumers who enjoy entertaining also like to decorate their kitchen areas
since guests typically gather there for holiday dinners and parties.  The
kitchen offers many surfaces where MagnaHang can be used, such as on
refrigerators and along range ventilation hoods and window treatments. 
•  Fabric – Since
MagnaHang can be enhanced with an additional Backer Magnet, the product can be
attached to drapery, curtains, tablecloths, lampshades and other fabrics in the
home, college dorm room, restaurant etc. 
•  Glass –MagnaHang can
be “attached” to certain glass surfaces, such as windows in exterior walls and
doors as if glued to the surface.  This can be accomplished by having two
MagnaHangs “attached” to each other through the glass.  Or, if the
MagnaHang is wanted on only one side of the glass, the Backer Magnet provides
the needed polar balance.
•  Plants – Many homes
and offices use large potted plants for accents and decoration. The MagnaHang
can also be used to hang additional decorations during the holiday season. 
•  Recreational Vehicles
– RV owners can especially benefit from MagnaHang as a solution for temporarily
installing seasonal lighting and decorations. MagnaHang is also an ideal tool
for quick and easy installation of low voltage lighting on the outside of RV’s,
to include Christmas lights and themed lighting. 
•  Other Holiday Applications
– MagnaHang can be used with other holiday and celebratory events that are
traditional times for decorating. In the United States, holidays such as
Halloween, Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Independence Day and
Thanksgiving are traditional observances when American’s tend to decorate. 
•  Celebratory Event
Applications - Decorators, event planners, event venues, and restaurateurs,
bar owners, and homeowners and renters alike will appreciate MagnaHang for
decorating their events with an even more festive appearance. Events such as
weddings, graduations, birthdays, anniversaries, Super Bowl parties as well as
corporate meetings all serve as occasions where seasonal or event-specific
colors can be easily facilitated by use of the MagnaHang. Most everyone
appreciates decorations, but most of us dread the task of decorating; MagnaHang
changes all of that dread to enjoyment as they are applied to any object where
a magnetic connection can be made
• Advertising Applications - The
MagnaHang can also be used to by companies for advertising or display purposes.
For example, no more droopy and falling
vinyl banners!  A few MagnaHangs
used in-line will perfectly present a banner, temporarily or for the long term.
  MagnaHang can display business cards, signs, advertising cards, banners
or other objects in a new and attractive way.  Companies looking for a new and creative way to
show customer appreciation can do so by having its own logo custom imprinted
onto ornaments, such as a holiday ball.  Market studies have revealed that, regardless
of the theme, MagnaHangs frequently remain left in plain sight where they are
enjoyed year-round.

opportunities where MagnaHang’s assets can be directed toward helping
struggling individuals and worthwhile organizations. The possibilities to improve the quality of
lives are endless. 
MARKET ANALYSIS
An informal market
analysis was conducted by MagnaHang’s inventor, John Glover. Said analysis
included showing prototypes to family, friends, and business colleagues as well
as interviewing over 1,000 prospective customers at a New Jersey mall. The feedback was a resounding “where can we
buy this?!!” Participants of the test market who used MagnaHang at their homes have
commented that they are easy to use, especially “since there are no hooks,
tape, glue or nails to damage walls.” One evaluator reported back, “my kids
love this product and so does my wife”. Another
evaluator said; “I like them enough to leave ‘em up all year.” In the businesses where MagnaHang was donated
for test marketing, they were found to still be in place, and in view, over a
full year later. And such was the result
without prompting by the inventor who provided the prototypes. Further, John Glover, inventor of MagnaHang met with four (4) marketing
firms, two of which are of the most prominent in the industry. One industry
expert indicated, in essence, “let me market them and I’ll show you $350M in
sales during the first year”. A second
industry expert, who also has a considerable reputation, expressed the same
enthusiasm, but estimated first year sales to be a more conservative $120M. Finally, another industry expert and
multimillion dollar businessman (manufacturing and fulfillment provider) said;
“if this product has a problem, it will be that it will be too popular,
everyone is going to want it, and managing the growth will have to be one of
the main focuses. MagnaHang’s owners are dedicated to a business strategy that
will ensure the product is offered globally, but manufactured only in the
United States.  While its primary purpose
is to bring beauty and joy to all who take advantage of its unique features, we
anticipate a great degree of satisfaction will be achieved with the creation of
American jobs that are fueled by MagnaHang’s domestic AND global sales. 
Since the company is
new and very small, the cost of materials and supplies to produce the MagnaHang
unit is high given the smaller orders of materials. In addition, due to a lack
of adequate operating financing, the company is limited in its options for
production quantities and thus higher sourcing costs for those materials. TEST MARKETING 
Establishing an
initial market will determine local brand awareness recognition efforts. Such efforts will also begin to establish the
test market required by the large companies that have expressed interest in the
product. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION 
Utility patents are
currently in “patent pending” status. Said
patents have been filed by Volpe and Koenig, P.C. of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, which is one of the nation’s leading patent firms. COMPETITIVE MANUFACTURING 
Similar to other products,
it is very difficult to compete with offshore manufacturing on cost. The
company believes that it will be able to compete with other low cost
decorations because of its patent pending design and be able to show that MagnaHangs
are a new and distinctive way to decorate for the holidays. They actually enhance the beauty and functionality of the already existing ornament market.  Further, each MagnaHang is laser inscribed to
validate its authenticity as a quality product and that it is manufactured in
the USA.EQUIPMENT COSTS 
Few dollars are
needed for capital investment initially, as MAGNAHANGS are hand manufactured. However, as sales volume warrants, automated
equipment is available that can increase capacity. Please see link to “ www.Ciemmeo.com
” to view a video of such equipment. Estimated cost of each unit is $50K.LONG TERM CAPITAL
With adequate
financing, will be responsibly allocate funds to ensure growth both strategically and efficiency to maximize product while lowing our cost to maintain long term growth and profitability. IN SUMMARY
MagnaHang, as a company, has come a long way from concept to finished product.  The test market and industry response has been extremely favorable.  All that is needed to bring this product and its potential to life are ""seed funds"" sufficient to enable us to officially partner with designated vendors and barrel manufacturers to fulfill orders placed as a result of social media, catalogs and other proven forms of marketing.  Every indication points to the products success; adequate funding, combined with our unfailing commitment, will ensure it.  To all who share our vision and contribute to the dream, we offer our sincere and heartfelt appreciation.                  How to contact us: Call Michele Esposito directly 609-576-1070 Executive Assistant

<p>Diffusers have always been this not very beautiful misconception of smell stored in a jar that you have no control over whatsoever. You only get to choose 1 smell, you can’t control when it goes off, you have to manually refill it, and it is embarrassing to have it in public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We at Scentee are all about the smell experience. Back in 2013 we launched a successful campaign at a Japanese crowdfunding site, and got our first smart gadget ""Scentee Balloon"" off. It hit the world by a storm, successfully selling over 20,000 units.</p>
<p>For our next step, we wanted to try a ""product"" that can be used in every house. We looked at the objects around us, and found something that was hidden in plain site. The diffuser”. We created over 100 prototypes, and each time, our focus was on how to make the simplest, yet sexy design, that people will like whatever point in time they were in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal was clear, we wanted the simplest functional design. It had to be sexy and timeless. Some of the designs were very amazing on paper, but when we made prototypes of them, they weren't functional. Together with our manufacturing partner, we produced prototype over prototype, every time taking inspiration from a different life scene, until we reached what we thought was the ultimate design.</p>
<p>This design, the Scentee Machina, is a base that can be put on any flat surface, and detachable perfume parts. The base is connected with the internet, meaning you can program it the way you like. It’s the beginning of the smell revolution.</p>

<li>In 2012 scientists classified airborne particulate as a group 1 carcinogen. It's like lead…no amount is healthy.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a problem in your community too. 250 counties in the U.S. have more than 90 days of crappy air quality each year. And our home in sunny California has 9 of the 10 cities with the worst air quality in the US.<br/> </li>

So they did what nobody else thought to do — fix the problems.After years of research, engineering, and feedback from real families, we’re thrilled to introduce you to our labor of love. She’s packed with unique features and abilities that make her the most genius purifier around:          
 Let’s face it, today’s air purifiers are outdated appliances wrapped in sketchy marketing.   Most still have 3 antiquated speeds - like a blender circa 1984. Mila is different. She’s intuitive, honest, and is made with more thoughtfulness than grandmas's apple pie.      The biggest problem with air purifiers is that you don’t know if they’re actually doing anything. There’s no proof you can see. Mila solves that. Simply adjust the fan speed to your desired air quality and Mila shows you the estimated time to achieve it. It’s as intuitive as setting your thermostat. 
       She looks great in any room, amiright?        With Mila, you don’t have to worry about whether you have the right size purifier for every room. Mila is the first purifier with spatial awareness to give you the same level of performance, whether she’s placed in a 150 sqft nursery or a 400 sqft family room.        
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She’s the first purifier to detect room presence so she knows to quiet down when you enter the room and deep clean when you’re gone.          
The science of air quality is complicated. But Mila talks to you in plain language to fill you in on what’s going on, in terms (and emojis) you can understand.  The friendly Mila bot keeps you updated on the statusof your air throughout the day.
 
 
 
 

And Mila beautifully illustrates the air qualitythroughout your home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mila is the first purifier to include a life-saving carbon monoxide detector.  Did you know that carbon monoxide poisoning sends 20,000+ individuals to the ER each year in the US alone? That’s why Mila is the first purifier to include a carbon monoxide sensor to protect against malfunctioning furnaces and space heaters.      She also monitors room humidity and warns you if you’re at risk of mold. And if the outside air quality drops, Mila has you covered. She watches the outdoor forecast and adjusts automatically to ensure you’re consistently protected indoors.         Mila packs 45 sqft of certified HEPA, the gold standard in ultrafine particle filtration.  A lot of companies try to confuse you with big words: HEPA-type, HEPA-like, HEPA-grade, 99%-HEPA, patented nanotech, ionizes, neutralizes, destroys, vaporizes, etc. (Pro Tip: this is all b.s. made up by some marketing guy named Bob.)Certified HEPA is the only proven technology and the only material we trust at MIla. It's the ONLY filtration technology guaranteed to remove 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 micrometers (µm) in diameter including: smoke, allergens, house dust, dust mites, pet dander, mold spores, fungi, PM2.5, and PM10.      She also comes with up to 1.5lb of heavy-duty granular activated carbon, the gold standard in filtering harmful VOCs, odors and smelly cats. Other manufacturers cheat and call a few ounces of carbon dust a “carbon filter.” However, filtration of gases depends on the weight and depth of activated carbon. Mila’s patent-pending Dual-Flow filter allows her to hold an optional 1 lb of granular active carbon in a 3-inch bed, giving you best-in-class filtration for household odors and harmful VOCs from paints, carpets, and pressed woods.    Mila’s patent pending “Dual Flow” filter design solves a long-standing problem found in air purifiers. Though HEPA and granular activated carbon are the filtration gold standards, sandwiching them together in a purifier dramatically decreases airflow. Manufacturers cheat to work around this and preserve their CADR rating by sprinkling a few ounces of carbon dust in a prefilter and calling it a ""carbon filter."" But filtration of gases depends on the weight and depth of activated carbon. That “carbon filter” gets spent in a matter of days, if not hours.Mila’s Dual Flow design solves this. By using a novel, parallel-flow filter design, Mila is able to combine a primary filter of 45 sq ft of HEPA with a secondary filter of 1 lb of heavy duty granular activated carbon without the traditional performance hit.      
 Other air purifiers are priced like Ferraris and perform like golf carts.  Mila cleans the air more efficiently, for less $$ — making great air quality accessible for everyone.         
 Despite her tiny size, Mila is a powerhouse. She delivers a stellar 411 CADR m3/hr. (Translation: She dominates purifiers twice her size and price). See how long it takes Mila to clean each of these rooms in a real-world setting. This assumes that there is poor outdoor air quality, at a constant 75 AQI, so Mila needs to first clean the room AND maintain it from outside air infiltration.In this situation, Mila can provide an 11x protection factor from the air outdoors in under 40 minutes in a 350 sq ft living room - the equivalent of wearing a 3M mask.        See how she stacks up.   Mila has the other guys beat across the board, from performance to price.  
     Most air purifiers include one filter that tries to do a little bit of everything (but isn’t good at anything). Whether you’re battling allergies, pet odors, urban smog, or home renovation dust and chemicals, Mila has you covered.      
 An aerospace-grade control system (really) and 8 magic sensors.  That’s right, Mila is built on rocket science: Her control system is designed on the same principles that guide jet efficiencies and is light years ahead of the market. Mila’s algorithms combine the physics of air flow and air filtration with real-time data from 8 built-in air quality sensors (thanks to Kevin, our resident rocket scientist).These precision sensors contribute to Mila’s state-of-the-art control system, measuring everything from micro-particles (as tiny as 0.01 microns wide) to volatile organic compounds and humidity. You can breathe extra easy knowing these 8 super sensors have your back:        
 At Mila we feel incredibly lucky to be able to make products that have such a meaningful impact on the health and wellbeing of the people we love.  We take that responsibility seriously. That's why we provide an industry-leading guarantee, including:
 Money-Back Guarantee: If you don’t love Mila, you can return her within 30 days for a full refund, minus shipping and handling.
 One-Year Warranty: Should something happen with your Mila, no worries—you’re covered.
 The Mila Promise: Honestly clean air from an honest company.

 Built by three dads who wanted better for their families—and yours. As fathers living in Shanghai, we got up close and personal with the impacts of urban air pollution. Between chronic respiratory illnesses and weekends cooped up indoors, we saw firsthand how the smog affected both the physical and mental wellbeing of our families—and decided to do something about it.And as you may have guessed, we named the company after one of our own children so that we would be constantly reminded of our commitment to our families, and our customers’ families.  Because nothing is as essential as the air we breathe - but most of us feel it's beyond our control.  We are vigilant about what our kids eat and drink but have no idea what’s in the air they breathe. We need to take it seriously. 
Air pollution from burning fossil fuels has emerged as the world's single largest environmental health risk. 
The effects of dirty air on the human body are slow moving and scientists are only now starting to fully understand them. 
In 2012 scientists classified airborne particulate as a group 1 carcinogen. It's like lead…no amount is healthy.
Yes, it's a problem in your community too. 250 counties in the U.S. have more than 90 days of crappy air quality each year. And our home in sunny California has 9 of the 10 cities with the worst air quality in the US. 
And our homes are no oasis ...they’re basically just boxes full of even crappier air. In fact, your house can be up to 5 times more polluted than outdoors. And if you’re like most people, you spend the vast majority of your time there.Today’s air purifiers aren’t even close to solving the problem. They’re outdated appliances wrapped in sketchy marketing. So yeah, you don’t just need an air purifier. You need the best air purifier you can get your hands on. You need Mila.",68.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://swamplot.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/landfill-landscape.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It impacts our land, our waterways and no matter where it is dumped, it creates emissions which have an impact on the air we breathe, while slowly destroying the ozone layer above us.</p>
<p>Of all the waste we produce, tires and plastics are our biggest problem globally.  They take hundreds, if not thousands of years to break down. </p>
<p>And while we are all about recycling, the statistics for what ends up in our landfills is staggering.  </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mrw.co.uk/pictures/586xAny/5/8/4/1302584_Bales_of_plastic_for_recycling.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bales of Plastic Waste""/></p>
<p>In the United States 100 billion plastic bags are dumped every year, or <strong>11,500,000 per hour!</strong></p>
<p>In New Zealand 1 billion plastic bags are dumped each year, or <strong>40,000 per hour!</strong></p>
<p>And that’s just plastic bags.</p>
<p>In the United States 32 million tons of plastic waste was generated in 2011, but only 8 per cent was recovered for recycling. Largely this is because there are approximately 7 grades of plastic and only 2 are capable of being re-cycled. The rest is dumped and goes to landfill.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://harmonicenergyinc.com/wp-content/uploads/tire-dump-usa-recycling-waste-tyres-europe-pyrolysis-pile-landfill-california.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Tires are as much of a problem. It is estimated that on average every person disposes of 1 tire annually. That’s more than <strong>316 million</strong> per year in the United States, and <strong>4 million</strong> per year in New Zealand. Almost all of them are chipped and landfilled.</p>
<p>But what if we looked at tires and plastics differently?  What if we saw them as a resource, a potential source of fuel, something we could create renewable energy from?</p>
<h1><strong><br/></strong></h1>
<h1><strong>What Have We Been Doing?</strong></h1>
<p>We are a small team that, for the better part of three years have been dedicated to researching the waste and recycling industry.</p>
<p>We searched the globe looking at technologies and seeing how they performed. Assessing their ability to process various waste streams, generate electricity efficiently and all with little to no emissions ensuring they fit our clean, renewable image. We knew there had to be a better, cleaner and more sustainable alternative to landfill. <strong>And the good news – there is.</strong></p>
<p>Waste conversion technology has existed in some form or another for many years.  Local governments have been given clear directives to start dealing with our waste better, and are interested in the technology on offer.  So why don’t we have hundreds of these in operation?</p>
<p>The main reason is the huge gap that exists between the technology developers, and the market.  For a start they barely speak each other’s language.  On one side you have the developers, focusing on their technology.  And on the other side the market, consisting of Local Government and industry, who very much want to be disposing of our waste in more sustainable ways, but lack the time and resources to bring one of these projects to life.</p>
<p>So we set out to bridge that gap, to be the solutions provider in the middle, the passionate individuals that are required to get everyone working together.  Our role has largely been to get the two talking, but also to be solving the issues that make one of these projects come alive, like locking down the waste resource, negotiating power purchase agreements with energy companies, looking for potential sites, ensuring environmental permissions are obtained and finding stakeholders to be involved in the projects.</p>
<p>Initially we set out to try and solve all waste issues, however we realised that we needed to start somewhere and our focus turned to plastics and tires because of the huge problems they are causing globally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1><strong>What We Want To Do</strong></h1>
<p><em>'Unfortunately, <strong>the traditional waste-handling sector does not invest in new technology.</strong> Companies developing new technologies must find a way to fight this inertia whilst convincing the investment community that those same waste handlers will adopt the new technologies once they are proven.....One important way to fight big business and the oil lobby is to actually build plants using alternative technologies and prove them wrong and that our technologies can do it better both economically and environmentally.' - Waste Management News</em></p>
<p>We identified two initial projects. One based in California, and the other in New Zealand, and we have been working hard to make them happen. The clients are ready, the technology is ready and the waste streams have been identified.  The projects are fairly advanced but what they require now is further funding in order to complete them.   </p>
<p>So that we can bring them both to fruition at once, we are looking to raise a further $200,000.   This would allow us to finalise the work required to bring them to contract stage and see them developed.  Part of this is being able to engage with external contractors on the unique engineering for each site, updating our Feasibility Study and financial modelling, finalizing the waste &amp; electricity contracts and the legal work required on the contract with the clients and stakeholders.</p>
<p><strong>There is a huge desire globally for the projects that we are offering.</strong>  We have done a lot of work to get to where we are now, and the only difference between launching one or five is the resource required to bring them to fruition. So any further funds raised will go directly towards getting the pipeline of projects that we have off the ground, and in the quickest timeframe possible. </p>
<div> <p></p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>How It Works. </strong></h1>
<p>The process converts the tire and plastic waste into other sustainable products such as fuel oil, and in the case of tires, carbon black and steel recovery which are used in manufacturing.</p>
<p><img alt=""Shredding the Tires."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/768/512/2a272adc3454e0080ca8d6397c4995c7_large.JPG?1374548705"" src="""" style=""""/><b>Shredding the Tires.</b></p>
<p>The end fuel oil can be used to run generators to create electricity, or be further refined to create a green diesel for use in vehicles.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/767/555/357d3d270bfe0c02f79ed023f449f70f_large.JPG?1374529872"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One project will process a minimum 10,000 tons of waste tires (equivalent to 1 million car tires) and plastics per year, which will create enough green diesel to fuel 2500 vehicles or enough renewable energy to power 2000 homes.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/770/872/0f343dbd8424d88b00b2c95b09431168_large.JPG?1374617063"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This technology process is Eco-friendly removing any of the nasty ingredients that occur in tires and plastics with virtually zero emissions. The technology is EPA approved, and meets the strictest air quality tests globally.</p>
<p><b>Once the tires or plastics have been through the system there is nothing left, everything is 100% used.</b></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/769/089/f7b7aeb58b2c97607cce8c739eb5bc94_large.jpg?1374566601"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1><strong>The Current Environment. </strong></h1>
<p>Big waste management companies have monopolised and controlled the market, from collection through to disposal at landfill. For them the single focus has been on maximising profits with little regard for the environment.  Investment in landfill has meant alternative disposal solutions have been pushed to one side, by the existing waste management companies. This has made it difficult for the small technology companies to bring their solutions to market. But by combining forces, using their engineering skills coupled with our commercial skills we have been able to work together to begin seeing these projects come to life.</p>
<p>However big is not necessarily better.  In the past, waste conversion projects have needed to be large-scale for the economics of the project to work.  This has meant huge amounts of waste have been required in order to see them fully realised.  The pre-existing waste management companies have been reluctant to let any of this go as it directly affected their bottom line.  However over the last couple of years as technologies have improved, the scale of the projects has been brought into alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Think globally act locally.</strong></p>
<p>We are all about smaller, regional projects for several reasons.  Small projects make a huge difference to our communities.  Regional projects create local jobs, waste is dealt with at source so lessening the need for it to be transported large distances, therefore less damage to the environment through added vehicle emissions. Electricity is generated locally without the need for it to be transported through often at capacity transmission lines.  This has a huge impact on the sale price, making electricity much more affordable.  Therefore its not just the environment that these projects bring about positive change to.</p>
<p><strong>Educating the decision makers.</strong></p>
<p>While our governments have understood that change in the way we deal with our waste is necessary, one of the biggest problems they/we faced was the long-term contracts they had signed with the large waste management companies.  This has meant that change has been gradual, as they have sought to regain control of our waste and where it is going.  Working with them, helping them to see that alternatives are available has been a big part of our work to date.</p>

<h1><strong>Why We Are Appealing To You.</strong></h1>
<p>When we first looked at Crowdfunding, we knew this was the way to really make these projects happen, to give them the launching pad they truly deserved. We knew that the spirit of the Indiegogo community was where it was at.</p>
<p>Renewable energy projects make the world better for everyone. Full stop. From household’s knowing that their waste was going somewhere more sustainable than landfill, the renewable energy that is generated, to the hundreds of new jobs created from building and operating these plants, and each employee knowing they are working for something sustainable and worthwhile.</p>
<p>We absolutely know that getting these projects out to the world can have such a big impact, why not give everyone the opportunity to support this and help make it happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>How The Funds Will Be Used.</h1>
<p></p>
<p>We need your help to finalize our Projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1) Update Our Feasibility Study: </strong>We have a comprehensive Feasibility Study that we have completed.  There is some updating and expansion to the financial modelling that is required, plus final auditing by our accountants to satisfy the stakeholders. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>2) Stakeholder Negotiations:  </strong>We are in final negotiations with our stakeholders which requires engaging with the legal team.</p>
<p><b>3) </b><strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Legal Work: </strong></strong>As well as the legal work that is required above, we also need to engage lawyers to draw up contracts.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: initial; border-color: initial;""></p>

<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">3) Bridging The Gap:  </strong>Pre-project costs such as the planning and decision making process.  Time related costs i.e the timeframes involved in getting this tech to market, keeping the momentum up and the cost of staying in front of the decision makers.  All of this has taken time and money.  We have been 100% self-funded to date, but that little bit of extra support from you guys, the Indiegogo community, will really help bring these projects to life, and quickly.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial;"">We are nearly there! With your support we expect to have the first contract signed by <strong>December, and work on the first project to be underway by February 2014</strong>. We are very excited about this project and hope you are too. We appreciate your support and would love it if you would share us with your friends too!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The amount of funding we require to achieve the final milestones is $200,000. We hope you are able to help us deliver these projects which will bring financial and environmental benefits to our communities. </p>

It impacts our land, our waterways and no matter where it is dumped, it creates emissions which have an impact on the air we breathe, while slowly destroying the ozone layer above us.
Of all the waste we produce, tires and plastics are our biggest problem globally.  They take hundreds, if not thousands of years to break down. 
And while we are all about recycling, the statistics for what ends up in our landfills is staggering.  

In the United States 100 billion plastic bags are dumped every year, or 11,500,000 per hour!
In New Zealand 1 billion plastic bags are dumped each year, or 40,000 per hour!
And that’s just plastic bags.
In the United States 32 million tons of plastic waste was generated in 2011, but only 8 per cent was recovered for recycling. Largely this is because there are approximately 7 grades of plastic and only 2 are capable of being re-cycled. The rest is dumped and goes to landfill.
 
Tires are as much of a problem. It is estimated that on average every person disposes of 1 tire annually. That’s more than 316 million per year in the United States, and 4 million per year in New Zealand. Almost all of them are chipped and landfilled.
But what if we looked at tires and plastics differently?  What if we saw them as a resource, a potential source of fuel, something we could create renewable energy from?

What Have We Been Doing?
We are a small team that, for the better part of three years have been dedicated to researching the waste and recycling industry.
We searched the globe looking at technologies and seeing how they performed. Assessing their ability to process various waste streams, generate electricity efficiently and all with little to no emissions ensuring they fit our clean, renewable image. We knew there had to be a better, cleaner and more sustainable alternative to landfill. And the good news – there is.
Waste conversion technology has existed in some form or another for many years.  Local governments have been given clear directives to start dealing with our waste better, and are interested in the technology on offer.  So why don’t we have hundreds of these in operation?
The main reason is the huge gap that exists between the technology developers, and the market.  For a start they barely speak each other’s language.  On one side you have the developers, focusing on their technology.  And on the other side the market, consisting of Local Government and industry, who very much want to be disposing of our waste in more sustainable ways, but lack the time and resources to bring one of these projects to life.
So we set out to bridge that gap, to be the solutions provider in the middle, the passionate individuals that are required to get everyone working together.  Our role has largely been to get the two talking, but also to be solving the issues that make one of these projects come alive, like locking down the waste resource, negotiating power purchase agreements with energy companies, looking for potential sites, ensuring environmental permissions are obtained and finding stakeholders to be involved in the projects.
Initially we set out to try and solve all waste issues, however we realised that we needed to start somewhere and our focus turned to plastics and tires because of the huge problems they are causing globally.
 



What We Want To Do
'Unfortunately, the traditional waste-handling sector does not invest in new technology. Companies developing new technologies must find a way to fight this inertia whilst convincing the investment community that those same waste handlers will adopt the new technologies once they are proven.....One important way to fight big business and the oil lobby is to actually build plants using alternative technologies and prove them wrong and that our technologies can do it better both economically and environmentally.' - Waste Management News
We identified two initial projects. One based in California, and the other in New Zealand, and we have been working hard to make them happen. The clients are ready, the technology is ready and the waste streams have been identified.  The projects are fairly advanced but what they require now is further funding in order to complete them.   
So that we can bring them both to fruition at once, we are looking to raise a further $200,000.   This would allow us to finalise the work required to bring them to contract stage and see them developed.  Part of this is being able to engage with external contractors on the unique engineering for each site, updating our Feasibility Study and financial modelling, finalizing the waste & electricity contracts and the legal work required on the contract with the clients and stakeholders.
There is a huge desire globally for the projects that we are offering.  We have done a lot of work to get to where we are now, and the only difference between launching one or five is the resource required to bring them to fruition. So any further funds raised will go directly towards getting the pipeline of projects that we have off the ground, and in the quickest timeframe possible. 
 
 
How It Works. 
The process converts the tire and plastic waste into other sustainable products such as fuel oil, and in the case of tires, carbon black and steel recovery which are used in manufacturing.
Shredding the Tires.
The end fuel oil can be used to run generators to create electricity, or be further refined to create a green diesel for use in vehicles.

One project will process a minimum 10,000 tons of waste tires (equivalent to 1 million car tires) and plastics per year, which will create enough green diesel to fuel 2500 vehicles or enough renewable energy to power 2000 homes.

This technology process is Eco-friendly removing any of the nasty ingredients that occur in tires and plastics with virtually zero emissions. The technology is EPA approved, and meets the strictest air quality tests globally.
Once the tires or plastics have been through the system there is nothing left, everything is 100% used.




The Current Environment. 
Big waste management companies have monopolised and controlled the market, from collection through to disposal at landfill. For them the single focus has been on maximising profits with little regard for the environment.  Investment in landfill has meant alternative disposal solutions have been pushed to one side, by the existing waste management companies. This has made it difficult for the small technology companies to bring their solutions to market. But by combining forces, using their engineering skills coupled with our commercial skills we have been able to work together to begin seeing these projects come to life.
However big is not necessarily better.  In the past, waste conversion projects have needed to be large-scale for the economics of the project to work.  This has meant huge amounts of waste have been required in order to see them fully realised.  The pre-existing waste management companies have been reluctant to let any of this go as it directly affected their bottom line.  However over the last couple of years as technologies have improved, the scale of the projects has been brought into alignment.
Think globally act locally.
We are all about smaller, regional projects for several reasons.  Small projects make a huge difference to our communities.  Regional projects create local jobs, waste is dealt with at source so lessening the need for it to be transported large distances, therefore less damage to the environment through added vehicle emissions. Electricity is generated locally without the need for it to be transported through often at capacity transmission lines.  This has a huge impact on the sale price, making electricity much more affordable.  Therefore its not just the environment that these projects bring about positive change to.
Educating the decision makers.
While our governments have understood that change in the way we deal with our waste is necessary, one of the biggest problems they/we faced was the long-term contracts they had signed with the large waste management companies.  This has meant that change has been gradual, as they have sought to regain control of our waste and where it is going.  Working with them, helping them to see that alternatives are available has been a big part of our work to date.
 

  
Why We Are Appealing To You.
When we first looked at Crowdfunding, we knew this was the way to really make these projects happen, to give them the launching pad they truly deserved. We knew that the spirit of the Indiegogo community was where it was at.
Renewable energy projects make the world better for everyone. Full stop. From household’s knowing that their waste was going somewhere more sustainable than landfill, the renewable energy that is generated, to the hundreds of new jobs created from building and operating these plants, and each employee knowing they are working for something sustainable and worthwhile.
We absolutely know that getting these projects out to the world can have such a big impact, why not give everyone the opportunity to support this and help make it happen.


How The Funds Will Be Used.

We need your help to finalize our Projects.


Here is how we will invest the funding we receive:


1) Update Our Feasibility Study: We have a comprehensive Feasibility Study that we have completed.  There is some updating and expansion to the financial modelling that is required, plus final auditing by our accountants to satisfy the stakeholders. 


2) Stakeholder Negotiations:  We are in final negotiations with our stakeholders which requires engaging with the legal team.
3) Legal Work: As well as the legal work that is required above, we also need to engage lawyers to draw up contracts.


3) Bridging The Gap:  Pre-project costs such as the planning and decision making process.  Time related costs i.e the timeframes involved in getting this tech to market, keeping the momentum up and the cost of staying in front of the decision makers.  All of this has taken time and money.  We have been 100% self-funded to date, but that little bit of extra support from you guys, the Indiegogo community, will really help bring these projects to life, and quickly.

We are nearly there! With your support we expect to have the first contract signed by December, and work on the first project to be underway by February 2014. We are very excited about this project and hope you are too. We appreciate your support and would love it if you would share us with your friends too!

The amount of funding we require to achieve the final milestones is $200,000. We hope you are able to help us deliver these projects which will bring financial and environmental benefits to our communities.
