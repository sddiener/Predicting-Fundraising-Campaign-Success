<p>We have recorded half of the album and I will be returning to Studio 606 to finish the album in June.  The rhythm tracks were laid down in a record 2 days to tape by drummer Rob Ahlers and bassist Uriah Duffy.  I recorded violin to half of the songs and will finish the rest of the album and mix it during our two week session in June.  </p>
<p>The album is a sonic journey of awakening to a personal and collective freedom and power ~  grounded in the raw truth of the human experience and lifted by a connection to ethereal worlds.  </p>

</div></div>","We are recording our Epic Debut Album at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 and we need your help to finish it!!!






  ~ Galactic power trio fronted by violinist, vocalist and composer Emily Palen wrestles their music up from the heart, blood, guts and glory of real human life;  propping it onto the infinite horizon of our great many galaxies.  
Emily Palen : Violin - Vocals - Composer
Uriah Duffy : Bass
Rob Ahlers : Drums










Make a kick ass record ~ Tour the World ~ Live Free!   Blast Earth with Love through the Epic Power of Music!

We're halfway through recording and need your help to fund the final two week session of the record in June.  We are recording at Studio 606 with the best people and best gear in the industry.  This album is going to take the world by storm and we need your help to make it real.   







Hi!  Thank you for checking out my fundraiser and supporting KnightressM1.  This band is a culmination of my every breath and heartbeat since I was a child.  I fell in love with the violin early and it continues to be my reason and my way.    From a young classical training to my heavy rocker heart, this music is my everlasting fire.   This album is the story of my own Super.Hero.  



KnightressM1 ~ Music for Super.Heroes. 

You and me ~ hanging on the edge of a planet brinking on rebirth ~ with       
            wings and a match we set it all ablaze and sing ~ to be free ~ to be free.  

    
THE BACK.STORY. ~ I played with The Foo's at Red Rocks:
After meeting them here:

By winning a contest with this video:

Then Dave invited me to record this album at his studio using the Neve Board featured in his ""Sound City"" Documentary and his amazing team of engineers and studio assistants.  Check out the trailer for the documentary!





   15 Songs ~ 15 Dimensions ~ 15 Videos
                            One Complete Story of KnightressM1
We have recorded half of the album and I will be returning to Studio 606 to finish the album in June.  The rhythm tracks were laid down in a record 2 days to tape by drummer Rob Ahlers and bassist Uriah Duffy.  I recorded violin to half of the songs and will finish the rest of the album and mix it during our two week session in June.  
The album is a sonic journey of awakening to a personal and collective freedom and power ~  grounded in the raw truth of the human experience and lifted by a connection to ethereal worlds.  




                                        

                                        




Engineering the record is super-pro Jon Lousteau, chief engineer at 606.




We all work hard for the money and I appreciate your help more than you know.  I humbly ask you to help me reach the finish line and I promise to you I will do everything I can to make this album absolutely kick ass and be worth every penny donated.   
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES ~
$14,000 for 14 studio days at $1,000 per day from June 7-20
I will personally be covering all travel, lodging, and pyrotechnical expenses.




Dreams As Reality ~
We all have dreams inside of us that refuse to die, that are determined to come true.  I'm asking you to support us now in the last leg of the journey.  
I'm so excited to be making this album.  I believe in it with all my heart and soul.  I know you'll believe in it too!  Thank you for all of your help!  
My Gratitude to You ~
You have received this invitation to be part of this because I know you, value you and genuinely love you as a unique powerful person on the planet.  I want to personally thank you for being supportive of me and my music and for bringing magic and moments of truth into my life.  As you all know deeply within your own hearts, this life is a full spectrum of emotion and experience and the most important part of it all is who you meet on the way and the friendships that are born.  Thank you so much for being a beautiful part of my life.   ~emily

</div><div>We're a Heavy Metal Band based out of Upper Marlboro, Maryland. We've been at this for approximately five years. We started LouderThanQuiet in the summer of 2010 when we branched off from another group. Over the years we've taken pride in learning how the music industry works, what drives it and how we can set ourselves up to be the most successful. One thing about this group that we've noticed is our ability to get through adversity. It seems as though everyone and everything is out to stop us, yet, we continue to push on and reach for higher goals.We're an independent band, no labels, no contracts. We take pride on being able to blaze our own path and do things how we want. We've never been ones to conform to what people want. We do our thing and hope folks can get down with what we do.</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>So you may wonder, how did we come up with our number for our goal? Our planned uses for the fund are divided into three categories: <b>Music</b>, <b>Transpo</b>, and, <b>Merch</b>. First and foremost we would like to be able to go in studio and record our full-length album with Producer Jamie King. So that would provide the tunage. But what is tunage if you can't get around to share with folks in front of their face? We've never toured, we've never been outside of our general area to share our <b>Music</b>? Why? Having reliable <b>transportation</b>, so we can accept those show offers in New York and North Carolina. We want to get to you!! Help us, Help you, Help Everyone. Finally, <b>Merchandise</b>! We have an extremely talented artist in our corner who is constantly scheming up designs and once we get those means to print up this Merch we're going to spread it like wildfire. Check out the perks, I think we have a little something for everybody!</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>So what's standing in our way? Simple, the industry. Trying to break into the industry is beyond difficult. Talking to the folks we know who are in and successful, we realize just how much dedication is required to set yourself up to be successful. You can do everything right, but you still need a little bit of luck. And watching others try to achieve the same thing we are, we see the difficulty, we feel the difficulties. However, we have our team, we've constructed our plan. Now, its time to make it happen. Hopefully with your help we'll get the jumpstart we need to shock the world. Come be a part of the team!</p>
<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can not donate, that's still fine. There are plenty of ways we could use your help. Directing a friend, family member, coworker, girlfriend, boyfriend, dog, cat, alien life-form or anybody or thing to our social media accounts is just as helpful. Granted Facebook likes and Instagram followers do not pay the bills. But the ability to share with fans and interact is something that we hold to an even greater regard than money. </p>
<p><b>TL;DR</b> - We are a band aspiring to make great music and share it with everyone. We just need a little help!! </p>

<p>Just
a two-piece folk band from North Carolina, we recorded an EP in our
bedroom using only two microphones and our rag-tag talents. That same
EP has earned us the chance to work with Tinderbox Music (they work
with the likes of Ingrid Michaelson and Imagine Dragons)! Alas, radio
campaigns are <i>expensive. </i>So,
we're asking for your help! Together we can launch a national
campaign and make the dreams of two starry-eyed beach bums come true
:-)</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We
need $2,100 to reach 300 college radio stations and have monitoring
for 8 weeks. This price obviously pays for the company's services but
also all the postage included (300 stamps, envelopes, one-sheets,
etc..). The monitoring for each station helps us know where to tour
and where our music is well received. It can also lead to working further
with the company by licensing our music for TV!</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If
we raise the money within 30 days, our EP will be available on
BandCamp for one week at a “pick-your-price” option as a timely

<p><b>The

<p>We've
seen people dance, cry, and find joy in our music. We believe in what
we do. Lives can be changed with beauty and sincerity. The more

<p>Big

it will result in years of effort to find ourselves in the same

<p>Some
people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<p>Share
the word and help us make some noise. I have 700 friends on Facebook.
If everyone donated $3 we would be at our goal, everyone would get an

<br/>
<ul>
<li>Dans une situation idéale, un label, une major ou un producteur met de l'argent sur la table pour couvrir les différents frais. Ce n'est pas mon cas. Après m'être débrouillée pour faire en sorte que l'album soit là, je recherche des fonds pour la suite... <br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ftl4UPfssbkI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dtl4UPfssbkI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ftl4UPfssbkI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Jusqu'à aujourd'hui, voici ce que j'ai réussi à financer:<br/> <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- Enregistrement: studio, salaires musiciens, choristes, arrangeur, ingénieur du son, repas, transports etc...) <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- Mixage, le mastering, les retouches mastering éventuelles... </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> <br/>- Séance photo où il faut payer le photographe, le/la maquilleur/euse.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- Graphisme, car il faut bien la créer cette pochette d'album, le livret etc...    </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">      <br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- Fabrication des albums, les différents clips (réalisateur, repas, figurants...)<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- La scène, il faut créer le spectacle, payer les musiciens , le lieu pour répéter etc...<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- Parfois, lors de concerts, les transports ne sont pas pris en compte, donc c'est à moi de payer. Il y a aussi les tenues de scène, les voyages d'affaires et j'en passe...<br/><br/></span>

<li>L'industrie du disque est en mutation et il devient de plus en plus difficile pour les artistes d'intéresser les labels. Soyez plus intelligent que les maisons de disques! Rêvez avec moi! Vous obtiendrez des albums dédicacés, des billets pour les concerts, une écoute de l'album en avant première, un accès aux coulisses du succès :)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Si l'objectif n'est pas atteint, j'utiliserai quand-même l'argent récolté pour la promotion. Mais l'objectif sera atteint sinon, je risque de m'énerver comme dans la vidéo ci-dessous :P<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ft1NtRFdlkJ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dt1NtRFdlkJ4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ft1NtRFdlkJ4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>

<li>Il y a toujours un risque que cela ne fonctionne pas malgré tous les efforts, mais il y a plus de chances pour que ça marche lorsque l'argent n'est pas un problème.<br/><br/>

Moi, c'est Licia Chery!
Je suis une artiste indépendante, et j'ai de grands projets :)Ayant déjà récolté plus de 75'000€ pour la production de l'album, j'ai besoin de vous pour financer la promotion. Vous êtes partants?
Ma musique est un mix de soul, de pop et de rock. J'aime parler de la vie, de l'amour, de l'importance d'être heureux. Découvrez ma musique au fil de la page par des vidéos et des liens soundcloud.Ecoutez ici:
Combien?
Promotion Suisse/France par attachés de presse - presse écrite, presse web, envoi single aux radios, aux télés...:  9'800€Fabrication d'albums: 5000€5 clips vidéos- le plus important pour un artiste de nos jours c'est le visuel, le fait d'avoir plusieurs clips vidéos en stock est essentiel: env.25'000€Fonds pour transports- un aller/retour pour mes musiciens=1100€. Avoir un fonds pour toutes les fois où les transports ne sont pas pris en compte est nécessaire (~13 aller/retour): 15'000€Marketing France/Suisse: 7000€Frais impayés:- Il reste encore quelques frais impayés, à savoir ceux de la fabrication d'un partie des albums: 4785.-Il reste 3415.- pour les imprévus!
Je suis une battante, j'y crois et tous ceux qui me soutiennent me donnent la force d'avancer. 
L'album est enregistré, mixé, masterisé, en fabrication et tout est prêt! Ce qu'il manque? Des fonds pour le promouvoir!



Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtenez!


Dans une situation idéale, un label, une major ou un producteur met de l'argent sur la table pour couvrir les différents frais. Ce n'est pas mon cas. Après m'être débrouillée pour faire en sorte que l'album soit là, je recherche des fonds pour la suite... 

Jusqu'à aujourd'hui, voici ce que j'ai réussi à financer: - Enregistrement: studio, salaires musiciens, choristes, arrangeur, ingénieur du son, repas, transports etc...) - Mixage, le mastering, les retouches mastering éventuelles...  - Séance photo où il faut payer le photographe, le/la maquilleur/euse.- Graphisme, car il faut bien la créer cette pochette d'album, le livret etc...          - Fabrication des albums, les différents clips (réalisateur, repas, figurants...)- La scène, il faut créer le spectacle, payer les musiciens , le lieu pour répéter etc...- Parfois, lors de concerts, les transports ne sont pas pris en compte, donc c'est à moi de payer. Il y a aussi les tenues de scène, les voyages d'affaires et j'en passe...




Aujourd'hui, je n'ai ni label, ni fonds, et le travail n'est pas fini: il faut payer la promotion, la fabrication de nouveaux albums, des attachés de presse, faire des clips, avoir un fonds pour les trajets lorsqu'ils ne sont pas pris en charge... Bref, il faut de l'argent!
L'industrie du disque est en mutation et il devient de plus en plus difficile pour les artistes d'intéresser les labels. Soyez plus intelligent que les maisons de disques! Rêvez avec moi! Vous obtiendrez des albums dédicacés, des billets pour les concerts, une écoute de l'album en avant première, un accès aux coulisses du succès :)

Si l'objectif n'est pas atteint, j'utiliserai quand-même l'argent récolté pour la promotion. Mais l'objectif sera atteint sinon, je risque de m'énerver comme dans la vidéo ci-dessous :P



L'impact
Je vous ai parlé de ce que je n'ai pas, mais voilà ce que j'ai:

Un album sensationnel qui sort le 13 mars 2015!
Un spectacle que j'ai préparé spécialement pour vous!
De la foi de l'énergie et de la motivation!
Des tourneurs qui croient en moi!
Beaucoup d'émotion à partager!

Les labels/majors n'ont peut-être pas encore vu mon potentiel, mais si vous vous y croyez, je peux décrocher la lune!On tente le coup?


Risques et défis



Cet album représente plus d'un an de travail acharné. Avec assez de fonds, j'aurai de quoi motiver tous mes collaborateurs de donner le meilleur d'eux-même pour que cela fonctionne.

Il y a toujours un risque que cela ne fonctionne pas malgré tous les efforts, mais il y a plus de chances pour que ça marche lorsque l'argent n'est pas un problème.



D'autres façons d'aider

Who am I? I am Licia Chery!I am an indie artist and I have big plans :)I have already raised more than 75'000€ on my own to produce the album. Now I need you to help me finance the promotion.

The album is done. Recorded, mixed,

In a perfect world, a record label would put money on the table and pay for everything. I'm not in that perfect situation yet, but I know you'll get me there!Now that the album exists, I'm looking for money to promote it...

As of today, this is what I have managed to finance:- The recording: studio, musicians, backup singers, producer, sound engineer, food, transport costs...)- Mix, mastering...  - Photo shoots, makeup artists...- Graphic design (because you need to create the cd liner, the album cover, etc... )- CD production, music videos (director, food, actors...)- Stage, create the show, pay the musicians, the place to rehearse...- Sometimes, on some shows the transport costs is not taken care of so I have to pay for it... and the business traveling and so on...

Record labels and majors might not have seen the potential I have, but if you do believe in me I can do the impossible!
Shall we try?



Risks and challenges


This album has been more than a year of crazy work and expenses. With enough money, I'll be able to motivate press agents and other relevant people to help me do a great job. I'll be able to motivate everybody to work real hard to make this happen.

There is always a risk that it might not work, but it's easier to make it work when money is not an issue.

Lately people have been asking me over and over, ""when are you going to put out a CD!?"" Well that time is now, but I am going to need YOUR help. I have been writing new music that I have been wanting to release, badly. Just writing in this town, on a regular basis, has allowed me to hone my craft and become a much better songwriter than I ever thought I could be. Right now, I currently have a producer I am working with who is outstanding at what he does. We have been in the studio these past 3 weeks working on the lead single from the EP, Tipsy. So far, everything has come out fantastic and I couldn't be happier with the result! My goal is to release Tipsy to radio and try to fund new music and merchandise that way, but I'd like to get a head start on that, which brings me here to Indiegogo. Otherwise, the EP might take 6-8 months before it ever sees the light of day. I want there to be music available to everyone if Tipsy does end up doing well. So, if you do decide to contribute to the campaign, there will be plenty of incentives for you. The more you contribute, the better they get. I am incredibly excited about this new EP and I hope you are too. Thanks for checking it out, and if you feel so inclined, then please feel free to share with your friends and family. Every little bit counts! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3> <p>You may be asking yourself, why $3,500? That number is what I have come up with that will enable me to pay for the EP's production, as well as fulfill all rewards and printing hard copies of the EP. Your money is not cheap. But thanks to my Enginner/Producer, we have found an affordable way to get this whole thing done that works for both of our budgets. </p>
<p>Your money will go to:</p>
<p>Paying the Musicians, Mixing/Mastering, CD Duplication. Merchandise, Marketing/Promotion and Distribution.</p>
<p>If all goes well and we exceed the goal, any remaining money will go into making the EP even better, possibly longer with even more songs. That extra money will go towards more marketing, as well as a longer and bigger radio campaign. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your impact is huge. If I can't raise the money, I can't put out an EP. All of this relies on your generosity and I will be forever grateful for that. And you'll also get your cool stuff too!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As far as Risks and Challenges go, there aren't very many. Mainly, If I am short of my goal the EP may be shorter than anticipated (less songs). But I am determined to succeed and plan to do everything in my power to get to the goal. </p>

<p>Well, for all those hundreds of friends and disco fans around the world that have been asking me through the last couple of years will I ever start performing again...this should come as good news.  Seems that over the last few months there have been serious inquiries from promoters in the UK and Europe as to my availability to do same this coming Spring/Summer 2015.  </p>
<p>Nice!!  And after giving it considerable thought I've decided to give it a shot...at least before I have to make my entrance on stage using walker!!  (Only half kidding!!) </p>
<p>But before I can give them a serious response I'll have to put a few of the pieces together which is why I'm reaching out for a little financial help at this juncture.  The first step in the process will be to get the  performance tracks in place.  The existing three tracks in my possession (""Cathedrals"", ""Let Them Dance"" and ""Do You Want The real Thing?"") date back to 1979 and where converted from digital to analog about fifteen years ago.  Tracks like ""Hot Jungle Drums"", ""Indiscreet, ""Face Of Love"", ""Don't Keep It In The Shadows"" and whatever haven't been out of their boxes in 35 years!!</p>
<p>In order for me to use them in performance singing ""Live to Tracks"" they all have to be converted from two track stereo analog to digital...which includes ""baking"" them so as they don't turn into dust when played after all these years.  Then into a real recording studio with those huge AMPEX reel to reel playback machines, removing my original lead vocals, editing and digitally enhancing the recordings to bring everything up to what is considered 2015 state of the art.</p>
<p>That having been said it appears that I'll need a little help from my friends.  I sincerely wish I were in a financial position where I could cover the cost entirely myself but I regret that isn't the case.</p>

The New Album  
After a big search and multiple journeys, I connected with great artists including old friends from the underground scene in Tunisia at first, and then new collaborators from France, Iceland, Sweden and the United States. 
I am proud of what is emerging over years of collaboration, striving and inspiration. 
I am producing an album pushing the boundaries of music, by bringing analog North African rhythms and instruments through cutting-edge and very organic electronica. 


A unique sonic universe where shaded Arabic tones would
co-exist with thundering beats and searing melodies, evoking an urgent and
passionate search for humanity and truth.

Why I need you

I approached many record labels. None was ready to leap.  All had many good things to say, but none could imagine how I could fit. To some I was too exotic, to others, not enough. The world music labels wanted to keep me in some kind of an ethnic box. The indie labels can’t get past the fact that I sing in Arabic.  

The market believes that there are only modern artists from the West, and ethnic caricatures from places like Tunisia. 

I disagree. 
It is not only for Western artists and labels to define the way sounds will mix. Artists from the rest of the world can be influenced by rock or electronic music, be pioneers and have equal chances to be recognized artistically. 
I want to self-release this album, to send a strong message to the industry that it can no longer confine us by our backgrounds and to have the independence needed to create an art that is true to me. 
It will be a lot of extra work, and a lot of extra risk, but I refuse to compromise, to deny the mix of influences that made me the artist I am and that is the basis of my connection with my fans, friends and many creative partners.

I refuse to be dependent, I am complete and I draw an art that defies all limitations and borders. 
I need your support. If you believe that a woman can be an independent creative and a free artist, please help.

<p>Do you remember shows
like “Hell’s Kitchen”, “Metalla” or “Headbanger’s Ball?” We all sat glued to the tube, letting
spectacular music videos, legendary concerts and festival reports wash over us.<br/><br/>
For many of us, shows like these laid the groundwork for a lifelong passion for
rock and metal. <b>Metal isn’t just a genre, it’s an outlook on life and a way
of living it</b>. The demise of classic music television and the ever growing
tendency for its strings to be pulled by zeitgeisty trends quickly saw such
formats disappearing from the screen.</p>

Still rock and metal is barely represented. Imagine we had that single one spot, that hot zone where we can build all that together. <b>Our own Netflix just for rock and metal</b>. Where we are not zombies and eat what gets tossed in our direction, but a bunch of great people who meet and actively define, refine and grow the perfect meal. Talk about it after dinner. Become buddies and inspire each other. Let's fall back from the zombie zones and make that RockZone, shall we? <b>Support us and move in with us!</b><br/></span></div></span>

</div></div>","Do you remember shows
like “Hell’s Kitchen”, “Metalla” or “Headbanger’s Ball?” We all sat glued to the tube, letting
spectacular music videos, legendary concerts and festival reports wash over us.
For many of us, shows like these laid the groundwork for a lifelong passion for
rock and metal. Metal isn’t just a genre, it’s an outlook on life and a way
of living it. The demise of classic music television and the ever growing
tendency for its strings to be pulled by zeitgeisty trends quickly saw such
formats disappearing from the screen.







Today, we're all busy jumping back and forth between various instances of social web, audio and video streaming and on demand platforms while trying to keep our groups together and our sorry selves up to date. Still rock and metal is barely represented. Imagine we had that single one spot, that hot zone where we can build all that together. Our own Netflix just for rock and metal. Where we are not zombies and eat what gets tossed in our direction, but a bunch of great people who meet and actively define, refine and grow the perfect meal. Talk about it after dinner. Become buddies and inspire each other. Let's fall back from the zombie zones and make that RockZone, shall we? Support us and move in with us!








To build the platform with the greatest rock and metal concerts
we need money for licensing on a global state:


If we fund 50.000 EUR we will
     get more than 100 concerts and documentaries incl. Metal Evolution series,
     Slayer,  Mastodon, Accept and many more
We already are in negotiations with the biggest labels, bands and managements in order to get access to special contents and great concerts
In addition we will bring you the best news out of the rock and metal sector - including newcomer bands, new releases, festivals, tours and much more
We are going to produce content by ourselves - visiting concerts and festivals and give you behind the scene information on your favorite artists and bands
We already have support from: Accept, Overkill, Blind Guardian, In Extremo, EMP, Grüne Hölle, 70.000 Tons of Metal, RockFels Festival and many more.





If we reach more than 50.000 EUR we will license much more concerts and will organize a fantastic event for you as fans. Stay tuned for updates on this matter.

<p>In April, I'll be heading out west to Dallas,Texas to record an EP with producer Salim Nourallah, whose credits include producing several Old 97's records.  </p>

<p>Not too long ago, after many years of playing in a rock band, I began my journey as a solo singer/songwriter.  It's a bit of an odd transition going from rock band to solo acoustic guy.  The challenges of performing solo are numerous (no blaming the drummer when something goes wrong on stage), but so too are the rewards.  Moving from a band to solo performer has forced me to re-examine, and relearn to some extent, how I go about doing what I do.  Performing solo requires different skills than performing with a group, and I enjoy the challenge of continuing to learn and develop those skills.  </p>
<p>In 2013, I released my debut solo CD ""A Place in the Sun""and began traveling around the Mid-Atlantic region playing mini-tours as often as I could.  Did I mention that music isn't my full-time job, just my full-time passion?  I am an educator by profession.    </p>
<p>Anyway, it's time for new music again.  I'm excited about the new songs for the EP and can't wait to get into the studio.  I've always scrimped and saved to record and release records/CDs in the past, and although I will be doing that again, I am also asking for your help this time around.  Specifically, I am seeking your help to offset the additional costs of making this record associated with travel, hiring studio musicians, and paying for studio time in a land far, far away.</p>

<h1><b>The Man With The Boots </b></h1>
<p>My name is Rob Halligan. I'm a singer/songwriter. </p>
<p>Over the last ten years I've been creating music with the underlying message of hope, building bridges and finding diamonds in the dust. After losing my dad in the World trade Centre on 9-11 I decided to use music to turn that tragedy into something positive. I've worked with various charities using my songs to tell their stories and raise awareness of their work. That's taken me to places like Bangladesh, Ethiopia and South America as well as projects closer to home. </p>
<p>I even got to sing on BBC1 and Radio2! I've toured as a one man show all over the UK and beyond and now, for my next album, I'd like to try something a little different. <br/>
</p>
<p>Wherever I go I try and play for whatever-you-can-afford. I'd like to carry on doing that, making music available to whoever wants to hear it for whatever they can afford and I'd like to tour this next album with a band. <br/></p>
<p>But here's the big deal...</p>
<p>We're going to be raising money for <a href=""http://www.globalcare.org.uk/appeals/2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Care's Lent Appeal</a>,
 an emergency medical fund aimed at providing emergency help for some of
 the worlds most vulnerable kids. When I was in Bangladesh I met an 8 
year old girl. As we talked it was obvious she was in some pain. The 
interpreter told me it was her appendix and that she'd been like this 
for two weeks. When I asked why she hadn't been to hospital he told me 
her parents couldn't afford it. The cost? £60. We paid it and that night
 she had a successful operation. This was the seed that would start the 
Emergency Medical Fund. </p>
<p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoIjNpIhN0zI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoIjNpIhN0zI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoIjNpIhN0zI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>The last show we did raised over £1000 for the fund. </p>
<p>By joining this campaign you'll enable us to get out on the road as a four piece band still playing for what a venue or promoter can afford, whether that's a stadium, arena, school, music club, pub or house concert. It means we have more chance of covering the costs of travel, food and a bed for the night as well as the odd broken guitar string. We'll also be raising money and awareness of Global Care and their amazing work.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>Our target is £7500. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That covers the essentials like transport, food and accommodation and something for promotion - posters and flyers, enough for a 15 date tour and a target of £700 per show raised for Global Care. </span></p>
<p>For your hard work in helping us along the way there's a host of rewards from  name-checks on posters, free downloads, CD's and T-Shirts to gig's in your living room or stadium (if you happen to own one)!</p>
<p>If we don't make the goal, the money that is raised will still be used for live dates, just not as many as we hoped. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>Apart from helping raise more money for  <a href=""http://www.globalcare.org.uk/appeals/2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Care's Lent Appeal</a>, we'll be able to take the music and message to people who wouldn't normally get to hear it. One of the great things about playing on a ""whatever-you-can-afford"" basis is that folks who would otherwise not get to hear live music get the chance to go to a full on show. My music is all about sharing some positive hope and the more that can happen the better. We start to see a changed society.</p>
<p>Over the years I've played numerous events in such a variety of venues, from slums in Ethiopia and homeless shelters in Hull to audiences full of dignitaries and main stages at big festivals. Some events have helped raise money for good causes and some have helped raise the hopes of people stuck in a dark place. </p>
<p>Music has the ability to break down walls and build bridges. Part of this touring project is to do just that. </p>
<p>In the past 10 years I've helped raise over £50,000 for various causes. This is something new and I'd love you to be a part of it. <br/></p>

Wherever I go I try and play for whatever-you-can-afford. I'd like to carry on doing that, making music available to whoever wants to hear it for whatever they can afford and I'd like to tour this next album with a band. 
But here's the big deal...
We're going to be raising money for Global Care's Lent Appeal,
 an emergency medical fund aimed at providing emergency help for some of
 the worlds most vulnerable kids. When I was in Bangladesh I met an 8 
year old girl. As we talked it was obvious she was in some pain. The 
interpreter told me it was her appendix and that she'd been like this 
for two weeks. When I asked why she hadn't been to hospital he told me 
her parents couldn't afford it. The cost? £60. We paid it and that night
 she had a successful operation. This was the seed that would start the 
Emergency Medical Fund. 

The last show we did raised over £1000 for the fund. 
By joining this campaign you'll enable us to get out on the road as a four piece band still playing for what a venue or promoter can afford, whether that's a stadium, arena, school, music club, pub or house concert. It means we have more chance of covering the costs of travel, food and a bed for the night as well as the odd broken guitar string. We'll also be raising money and awareness of Global Care and their amazing work.   

Getting the Boots Walking 
Our target is £7500. That covers the essentials like transport, food and accommodation and something for promotion - posters and flyers, enough for a 15 date tour and a target of £700 per show raised for Global Care. 
For your hard work in helping us along the way there's a host of rewards from  name-checks on posters, free downloads, CD's and T-Shirts to gig's in your living room or stadium (if you happen to own one)!
If we don't make the goal, the money that is raised will still be used for live dates, just not as many as we hoped. 
The Impact
 Apart from helping raise more money for  Global Care's Lent Appeal, we'll be able to take the music and message to people who wouldn't normally get to hear it. One of the great things about playing on a ""whatever-you-can-afford"" basis is that folks who would otherwise not get to hear live music get the chance to go to a full on show. My music is all about sharing some positive hope and the more that can happen the better. We start to see a changed society.
Over the years I've played numerous events in such a variety of venues, from slums in Ethiopia and homeless shelters in Hull to audiences full of dignitaries and main stages at big festivals. Some events have helped raise money for good causes and some have helped raise the hopes of people stuck in a dark place. 
Music has the ability to break down walls and build bridges. Part of this touring project is to do just that. 
In the past 10 years I've helped raise over £50,000 for various causes. This is something new and I'd love you to be a part of it.

<p>The company uses its technology to capture and correlate the individual's extensive biological and/or
historical information for conversion into the digital world building the individual acrovirt's predictive mind, brain, body and voice. The individual’s acrovirt

<br/>
<h1>The Reason <br/>
</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Selena is the perfect artist to
become the world's first digital acrovirt. She is an icon of passion and talent that
caused the world to see (the value of art in the Latino American community) and
she brought Latino music to the masses with her talents. This Selena The One
campaign is important because it allows our revolutionary technology to come to
the marketplace through the best possible icon/artist and funding process we
can imagine. Acrovirt believes that crowdfunding is the newest pathway for new
technology companies' products to go to the marketplace.  This is an opportunity for Selena's fans to have direct involvement .<br/></p>

<br/>It is also the intention of the company to offer and sell securities, for the first
time ever under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s new rule change to
enable smaller companies to offer and sell equity. These new SEC regulations
come into effect in late summer, early fall of 2015 and Selena The One would
like to be the first to offer these opportunities. In compliance with all SEC regulations, this new development allows the fans of Selena to buy outright into their favorite artist digital acrovirt.<br/><p><span><br/></span></p>

I have worked in the Nashville music industry for over twenty-five years. I
have devoted my career to discovering, developing, and managing talent. Working in the music
business you are constantly approached by talented artists with big dreams and stars in their eyes. However, it takes more than talent to make it in this highly competitive, oversaturated, marketplace.  But every now and then you meet an exceptional artist who has everything it takes to become a
big star.  I believe that sixteen year old country singer/songwriter Maddie Logan is that
artist. I can say with complete confidence that she is a star soon to be
discovered. As we say in the music business she is the “complete
package” and could be the next big thing!</p><p>Not only is Maddie extremely talented as a singer and songwriter, but she  possesses a relentless drive and commitment.  I’ve personally never met an artist even close to her age that works as hard and is as committed as she is. Maybe that's because she has been in the entertainment business since age three.  There is only one thing lacking in order to take Maddie Logan's career to the next level, and that is funding. </p>
<p>The music business has
changed dramatically over the years and record labels expect a certain amount of artist development to be done before they will take a meeting.  Artists must have a quality recording that has already created a buzz and to have fan awareness through social media marketing. In addition, artists need marketing materials, EPK's, and videos. Record labels also expect you to have achieved CD and merchandise sales from promotion and touring. Again, it all takes a great deal of money.</p><p>Maddie has already accomplished so much on her own but now needs your support.  With your partnership she can record a stellar album from the songs that she has already written, sell her CD, then reinvest those sales back into her career to get to the next level.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Maddie picked
up a guitar at age eight, started writing music, and hasn't stopped since. She deserves the chance

<h2>Worum geht es in diesem Projekt?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Mir geht es darum, mein lang ersehntes, erstes Album auf die Beine zu stellen<br/>und zu veröffentlichen. Da ich mich dazu entschieden habe, alles mit einem<br/>eigenen kleinen Team selbst in die Hand zu nehmen, brauche ich Eure Unterstützung um die Produktion des Albums zu finanzieren.<br/>Ich lade Euch ein, Teil von diesem spannenden Projekt zu werden !</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h2>Was sind die Ziele und wer die Zielgruppe?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Ziel ist es, nachdem ich in den vergangenen Jahren zusammen mit verschiedenen<br/>Künstlern auf Bühnen in ganz Deutschland und Europa gestanden habe,<br/>endlich meinem eigenen Klangkosmos, meinen Songs Raum und Aufmerksamkeit zu geben und diese in einem Album zu verewigen.<br/>Viele meiner supporter warten schon lange darauf, meine Musik auf CD zu haben<br/>und sich ins Regal stellen zu können.<br/>Ich habe in den letzten Jahren viele Erfahrungen beim Produzieren und Songwriting<br/>gesammelt, nicht zuletzt innerhalb der Felix Meyer Band und der Produktion unserer vier Studioalben.<br/>Jetzt ist Zeit für Eigenes !<br/>Es gibt schon ein paar Vorproduktionen zuhause in meinem kleinen Home-Studio und ich kann Euch sagen - es wird wunderbar !</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h2>Warum sollte jemand dieses Projekt unterstützen?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Handgemachte Musik und ehrliche Texte werden immer seltener.<br/>Heutzutage kannst Du als Künstler mit einem Netzwerk von fähigen Leuten um Dich rum und einer community, die ein Projekt unterstützenswert findet und etwas in den magischen Hut schmeißt, einiges erreichen.<br/>Ich habe in den vergangenen Jahren gemerkt, dass meine Musik bei vielen von Euch<br/>großen Anklang findet.<br/>Dafür möchte ich mich mit meinem Album bedanken.</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h2>Was passiert mit dem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Das Geld ermöglicht mir, die Aufnahmen für das Album fertigzustellen,<br/>die Musiker Grafiker etc. gebührend zu bezahlen, die Songs <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">mixen </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">und           </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">mastern zu lassen.</span></p>
<p>Außerdem werde ich mit Eurer Hilfe die Kosten für die                                        <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Herstellung der CD decken.</span></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<h2>Wer steht hinter dem Projekt?</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In erster Linie <em>Erik Manouz,</em><br/>mein Netzwerk aus kreativen Freunden, die mich bei der Realisierung<br/>dieses Projektes unterstützen und natürlich meine Band.<br/>Ich hoffe natürlich, dass auch ihr Teil von diesem Projekt werdet !<br/>Los gehts !!! :)</p>

Ziel ist es, nachdem ich in den vergangenen Jahren zusammen mit verschiedenenKünstlern auf Bühnen in ganz Deutschland und Europa gestanden habe,endlich meinem eigenen Klangkosmos, meinen Songs Raum und Aufmerksamkeit zu geben und diese in einem Album zu verewigen.Viele meiner supporter warten schon lange darauf, meine Musik auf CD zu habenund sich ins Regal stellen zu können.Ich habe in den letzten Jahren viele Erfahrungen beim Produzieren und Songwritinggesammelt, nicht zuletzt innerhalb der Felix Meyer Band und der Produktion unserer vier Studioalben.Jetzt ist Zeit für Eigenes !Es gibt schon ein paar Vorproduktionen zuhause in meinem kleinen Home-Studio und ich kann Euch sagen - es wird wunderbar !



Warum sollte jemand dieses Projekt unterstützen?

Handgemachte Musik und ehrliche Texte werden immer seltener.Heutzutage kannst Du als Künstler mit einem Netzwerk von fähigen Leuten um Dich rum und einer community, die ein Projekt unterstützenswert findet und etwas in den magischen Hut schmeißt, einiges erreichen.Ich habe in den vergangenen Jahren gemerkt, dass meine Musik bei vielen von Euchgroßen Anklang findet.Dafür möchte ich mich mit meinem Album bedanken.



Was passiert mit dem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?

Das Geld ermöglicht mir, die Aufnahmen für das Album fertigzustellen,die Musiker Grafiker etc. gebührend zu bezahlen, die Songs mixen und           mastern zu lassen.
Außerdem werde ich mit Eurer Hilfe die Kosten für die                                        Herstellung der CD decken.



Wer steht hinter dem Projekt?

In erster Linie Erik Manouz,mein Netzwerk aus kreativen Freunden, die mich bei der Realisierungdieses Projektes unterstützen und natürlich meine Band.Ich hoffe natürlich, dass auch ihr Teil von diesem Projekt werdet !Los gehts !!! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul><li><b>MY QUALIFICATIONS TO EARN YOUR TRUST IN DONTATING TO MY CAMPAIGN</b></li></ul>
<p>Having lived in the great music cities of Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and now Austin Texas, I have managed to earn a living as a full time musician. I started and continue to maintain three great nights of music at two great Austin venues, Dozen Street and Strange Brew. These are themed nights that include the sounds of  Soul/HipHop/Jazz/ and Dance music. This is where I have built and continue to assemble my record concept.  When I lived in Philadelphia, I successfully ran a Jazz night  for 4 years at Vudu Lounge in West Chester PA, a very popular destination. as well as teaching at Eastern University were I taught Jazz Improvisation for 13 14 years.  I have produced my own records, including my debut record ""Deep Pm' in 2000. I have toured under my own name, handing all the booking/travel and technical issues. The skills I have acquired over the past two decades has prepared me to lead my own band and conquer the world!!</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><b>PRUDENT SPENDING</b></li></ul>
<p>There are always risks when booking a tour, as the saying goes, anything that can go wrong, will. The things I have already put into place already include a AAA Premium plan which helps in securing cheaper  hotel rates cheaper, airline tickets and other travel related costs. </p>

Having lived in the great music cities of Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, New York and now Austin Texas, I have managed to earn a living as a full time musician. I started and continue to maintain three great nights of music at two great Austin venues, Dozen Street and Strange Brew. These are themed nights that include the sounds of  Soul/HipHop/Jazz/ and Dance music. This is where I have built and continue to assemble my record concept.  When I lived in Philadelphia, I successfully ran a Jazz night  for 4 years at Vudu Lounge in West Chester PA, a very popular destination. as well as teaching at Eastern University were I taught Jazz Improvisation for 13 14 years.  I have produced my own records, including my debut record ""Deep Pm' in 2000. I have toured under my own name, handing all the booking/travel and technical issues. The skills I have acquired over the past two decades has prepared me to lead my own band and conquer the world!!

PRUDENT SPENDING
There are always risks when booking a tour, as the saying goes, anything that can go wrong, will. The things I have already put into place already include a AAA Premium plan which helps in securing cheaper  hotel rates cheaper, airline tickets and other travel related costs. 

PRELIMINARY BREAK DOWN OF FUNDS DISPERSION .                    
FISCAL BREAK DOWN









IF I DONT REACH MY FISCAL GOAL
In the event I don't reach my goal of $17000, the funds I do raise will be used to help finance the 20 city promo tour that is already in the progress of being booked. The remainder of dates to be booked is contingent on how much I can raise through this Indiegogo fund raiser. 
I believe the music that I am writing and performing now to be the best I've ever produced. I'm taking 20 plus years as a sideman, playing with all the great artists  mentioned in my summary, and filtering it through my own unique voice.

Sincerely


Dave Manley

<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3>The <a href=""http://gogosymphony.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Go-Go Symphony</a>, a new music phenomenon in Washington DC, is a symphony you can dance and party to.  And young people love it!  Therefore, it is a great way to introduce them to the power of

<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<br/>We need to raise $20 to $500 to send up to 25 students to the Go-Go Symphony concert. If we get more, that's fine too.  But even just $20 can buy one ticket, which can make make a big difference for one student.  Or you can give $1, which can get us just a bit closer to helping that one student.  <br/><br/>Tickets will be distributed to DC area school teachers and students who have expressed interest in group field trips or individual attendance.  They will also be distributed through announcements on radio stations.<br/>

<h2>Rise To Fall New Album is coming soon and we need your help to do our best!!!</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Hi guys!!! Here Rise to Fall speaking!!!</p>
<p>We are a death melodic metal band that has been playing together  since 2006.</p>
<p>We have already internationally released two works; ""Restore the Balance"" (2010) and ""Defying the Gods"" (2012), and we are about to publish our third studio album, mixed and mastered at Hansen Studios (Denmark).</p>
<p>We have big plans for this new project, such as recording a video clip or touring around Europe, Japan and, why not, America. However, and as it is the case of many other bands, before any of this can happen, we need to face a very worrying setback: MONEY.</p>
<p>We have worked very hard and counted on the collaboration of awesome professionals for this third album and, as it is obvious, this all entails big expenses. That is why we are asking for your help!! </p>
<p>The money we raise will be aimed at promoting the new album and merchandising it. It would also constitute a big boost to start touring.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>

<p></p>
<p>
Join us on our
mission to create more harmony around the world! With ancient Feng
Shui principles in mind, Grammy award winning producer/musician Jeff
Bova and Feng Shui expert Carole J. Hyder have created <i>Harmonize
Your Home</i> to
balance and energize your home, your life and your planet. 
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>
<b>Your donation
will be used to fund a focused marketing program that will raise
awareness of this revolutionary sound treatment. </b>By
improving the energy in our environment, we can increase the peace
and prosperity in our lives and the lives of others. Funds raised
during this project will help advertise and promote the use of
<i>Harmonize Your Home</i> around the world<i>.
Donate $25 or more and receive special gifts to harmonize your own
space as well!</i></p>
<p>Imagine if everyone had a home or office with perfect energy. Imagine a world where simply stepping into your office can make you happy, or working in your kitchen gives you peace. <b>Imagine a world where music can tame the environments where we live, work and play - and change our lives for the better. </b>This is the purpose of<i> Harmonize Your Home </i>and the Harmonics for Your Home Project.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<i><b>Harmonize
Your Home</b></i><b> is
music to balance any space! </b>By
improving the energy in your environment, you increase the peace and
prosperity in your life. Whether you're present or not, playing
the <i>Harmonize
Your Home </i>sound
treatment can better your home or office environment by bringing in
harmony and peaceful energy. </p>
<p>
We're raising
funds to further Harmonize Your Home's reach.  Our vision of people everywhere using the power of Feng Shui and sound to bring tranquility into their homes and lives can become a reality. Help us
increase awareness about the <i>Harmonize
Your Home </i>project
by donating today. Join Jeff and Carole and become part of a revolutionary movement to bring harmony to the world one home at a time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How <i>Harmonize Your Home</i> Works</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Feng Shui states for a space to be properly aligned - allowing maximum energy flow  - all five Chinese elements must be present. The presence can be a representative color or shape, or the element itself. Alignment and maximum energy can benefit your health, luck, fortune and beyond.  </p>
<p>Inspired by this concept, Jeff and Carole have created music that incorporates all five Chinese elements in harmonics that demonstrate vibrational patterns to attune the space for each element. Transitioning through Water, Wood, Fire, Earth and Metal, the benefits of this beautiful blend of music, science and East Asian philosophy can be experienced with no effort, making it a time-saving and pragmatic tool for those which to experience more harmony and a more peaceful environment.</p>
<p>You can leave <i>Harmonize Your Home </i>playing when you leave, and it will work its magic in your absence. This means after a day at the office, you'll return to a more balanced and energized home. Or when you get back to your office the next day, your workspace will be in synergy. Realtors can also use it to harmonize homes they're showing for sale!</p>

<b>Carole J. Hyder, MBA, WWM </b>has accomplished international success as a Feng Shui consultant, speaker, teacher, and trainer. Her main teacher was His Holiness Professor Thomas Lin Yun who lived in Berkeley until his death in 2010; she maintains her studies with his successor Her Holiness Crystal Chu Rinpoche. Carole is the author of three books and two videos and has appeared monthly on the NBC affiliate station KARE 11 Showcase MN discussing the various aspects of Feng Shui. Carole is founder and President of the Wind and Water School of Feng Shui, a private career school licensed by the Minnesota Higher Education Services Office. Prior to her pursuit of Feng Shui, Carole was a classically trained pianist, working toward a major in music from St. Teresa’s in Winona, MN. Although her major eventually changed, her interest in music did not. By combining her passion for Feng Shui with her musical background, she added a unique perspective during the shaping of the Harmonics for Your Home project.<br/><p></p>

How Harmonize Your Home Works

Feng Shui states for a space to be properly aligned - allowing maximum energy flow  - all five Chinese elements must be present. The presence can be a representative color or shape, or the element itself. Alignment and maximum energy can benefit your health, luck, fortune and beyond.  
Inspired by this concept, Jeff and Carole have created music that incorporates all five Chinese elements in harmonics that demonstrate vibrational patterns to attune the space for each element. Transitioning through Water, Wood, Fire, Earth and Metal, the benefits of this beautiful blend of music, science and East Asian philosophy can be experienced with no effort, making it a time-saving and pragmatic tool for those which to experience more harmony and a more peaceful environment.
You can leave Harmonize Your Home playing when you leave, and it will work its magic in your absence. This means after a day at the office, you'll return to a more balanced and energized home. Or when you get back to your office the next day, your workspace will be in synergy. Realtors can also use it to harmonize homes they're showing for sale!

About the Creators


Carole J. Hyder, MBA, WWM has accomplished international success as a Feng Shui consultant, speaker, teacher, and trainer. Her main teacher was His Holiness Professor Thomas Lin Yun who lived in Berkeley until his death in 2010; she maintains her studies with his successor Her Holiness Crystal Chu Rinpoche. Carole is the author of three books and two videos and has appeared monthly on the NBC affiliate station KARE 11 Showcase MN discussing the various aspects of Feng Shui. Carole is founder and President of the Wind and Water School of Feng Shui, a private career school licensed by the Minnesota Higher Education Services Office. Prior to her pursuit of Feng Shui, Carole was a classically trained pianist, working toward a major in music from St. Teresa’s in Winona, MN. Although her major eventually changed, her interest in music did not. By combining her passion for Feng Shui with her musical background, she added a unique perspective during the shaping of the Harmonics for Your Home project.
 
Jeff Bova is a Grammy Award winning record producer, arranger and composer from Los Angeles. In addition to his award winning work with Celine Dion, he has contributed to hundreds of recordings by significant mainstream artists like Katy Perry, Michael Jackson, Luther Vandross, The Back Street Boys, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, Meat Loaf, and more. Jeff’s experience with Feng Shui started in the 90’s when he hired a master to assess his recording studio in New York City for the purposes of enhancing the business. He saw firsthand the positive results that Feng Shui offered and became a solid supporter. The master was His Holiness Professor Thomas Lin Yun - Carole Hyder’s Feng Shui teacher.

<p>Why? Because clearly with sales exceeding 100 million copies since

coveted world record for the longest journey ever officially recorded on an electric bicycle.</p>
<p>It won’t be an easy

<p><b></b></p><p><b>Gary
Corbett</b> is an award-winning Australian journalist who since retiring from a
career spanning 30-plus years working as a newspaper journalist, now
concentrates on writing about all aspects of the organised cycle tour industry.
Over the past 10 years Gary has cycled well in excess of 30,000 kilometres

if it involves exploring yet another foreign country – especially if it is on a
bicycle. </p>
<p><b>Where
Will the Record Attempt be Held</b></p>
<p>Starting from London in late April 2015, the e-bike
record attempt will be held mainly on the <b>EuroVelo
European cycle route network</b> which consists of 14 transcontinental cycling routes
stretching from the Atlantic to the Black Sea and the Arctic to the

<p><b>Our
Campaign – Why We Need YOU</b></p>
<p>The bottom line is pretty simple really, what we are planning is hugely
expensive! That is why we would like to think that the entire Baby Boomer
generation – and also compassionate Xs and Ys out there – will get behind us so
we can show the world that it is even possible for a couple on the
“wrong side of their mid-50s” to become world record holders.</p>
<p>To successfully set a new world record will be a defining achievement for
both of us. To put it simply we are putting everything we have into the record
attempt in terms of time, money and commitment, and are hopeful that the
Indiegogo community will recognise our dedication to achieving our dream by
helping out financially. The resultant film will, in a small way, be a tangible
record of your financial assistance.</p>
<p><b>How the Funds Will be
Used</b></p>
<p>All of the money raised through Indiegogo will go directly to purchasing much
needed computer, video and camera equipment and all of the other gear needed to make the
record breaking ride a reality such as lightweight tents, camping equipment, biking
specific equipment, insurances etc, etc, etc … the list just goes on and on! </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>There
are risks and challenges associated with anything you do in life. But when it
involves up to 12 months of cycling in all sorts of climatic conditions across
all sorts of terrain in addition to the daily necessity to find places
to camp, charge the e-bike batteries and the other 1001 things that have to be
dealt with logistically on a self-contained fully loaded extended cycle tour, there is plenty that can and at times WILL
go wrong. All of these moments and more will be the subject of the video we will
be shooting.</p>
<p>But
while we clearly acknowledge the risks and challenges to be faced are very
real, it is important to clarify one very important fact ... we are far from elite
athletes. To put it simply we are just two people who love cycling - and cycling
together. Like anyone our age we have our fair share of niggling medical
issues, have dodgy knees and are always on the lookout for a good chiropractor
to keep our joints working as they should. But given all of the above, we are
supremely confident of being able to methodically chip away at the kilometres
to eventually lay claim to completing the longest ever electric bike journey
undertaken.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You

<p>If, for whatever reason, you are unable to help with a cash donation, we

<p>We wrote <i>Why Is This Happening</i> because we are very concerned about how the current debate about immigration has led to a lack of
serious and informed dialogue on the subject. Migration plays a hugely positive role in the UK workforce, contributing more to the treasury than is paid out, but instead what we’re hearing is scaremongering
rhetoric from politicians and the media based on untruths. Immigrants have become easy scapegoats for a raft of domestic problems –
housing shortages, unemployment, low wages, crowded schools and hospitals, and even congested roads! </p>

WITH Love 2015 UK is a music-led pre-election campaign to raise awareness about the anti-immigration rhetoric in the UK & the media. Its centrepiece is a song called:



'Why Is This Happening' 
(aka WITH)



It’s our love song to the UK.


It's our plea to everyone not to believe the divisive rhetoric.


It’s our call to action.







Why the WITH Love 2015
UK campaign matters 
We wrote Why Is This Happening because we are very concerned about how the current debate about immigration has led to a lack of
serious and informed dialogue on the subject. Migration plays a hugely positive role in the UK workforce, contributing more to the treasury than is paid out, but instead what we’re hearing is scaremongering
rhetoric from politicians and the media based on untruths. Immigrants have become easy scapegoats for a raft of domestic problems –
housing shortages, unemployment, low wages, crowded schools and hospitals, and even congested roads! 


                This disconnect between
perception and reality needs to be addressed. We want to stop the divisive rhetoric, and that's where you come in. 
With your funding and support, together let's make some noise with our song! Please join us on WITH Love 2015 UK campaign.

The remaining risks lie in the motivation and will power to maintain a very close and intimate relationship with all the inter-workings of this event, but due to the high emotional nature of this movement, with real messages, with real ability to change and save lives, we believe whole heartedly that we will succeed with this event and many more to come!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>ABOUT THE OPERA</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u></u><i>DeCachetitoRaspado </i>is a Comic-Hemofiction opera
created by two extraordinary Mexican artists: 
Juan Trigos, composer and conductor; and Juan Trigos Synister [Senior], novelist,
playwright and librettist.  Through their
works, both artists engage with culturally relevant and significant social
themes, such as absence, alcohol and drug abuse, and women’s roles in the
household and in society, opening a door to their conscience, urging us to
reflect and to peek into the depths of our own.</p>

<p><b>WHAT IS HORROR-HEMOFICTION?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Horror-Hemoficción (Horror-Hemofiction) is a literary movement of search invented by Juan Trigos Synister, father of the composer. It reflects the characters in a multitude of mirrors in which they contemplate, frightened, the thousand faces of their personal infantilism. The protagonists, human children, play at being serious adults, but are murderers or full of lies. In every novel, play, or short story, infantile cruelty invades. Perhaps, someday, spiritual awakening will lead to maturity, which would mean plenary responsibility from which all characters created by Juan Trigos Synister—precisely because they are human, that is to say, children—run away. Horror-Hemoficción, always in jest, profound and amusing literature, opens doors to the personal conscience of the author and, by expansive reflection, is road towards the intimate knowledge of the reader who is capable of peeking into his or her own depths.</p>

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">LIBRETTO BY JUAN TRIGOS SYNISTER <span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>SYNOPSIS</i></b>
</div></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The central theme in the opera DeCachetitoRaspado (CheekToStubbledCheek) is the absence that the characters, Juansonrisa and Primancianita, fill up by projecting their imaginings. She is sterile, so she gives birth to two siamese sons who accompany them in all their theatrical improvisations. The story begins with the introduction of these beings of invention speaking about a baptism —imaginary as well—to which the president who has governed Mexico at diverse stages of the country’s life keeping the same criminal tendencies, will attend. Same imposing personality in collusion with the Church. There will be baptism with piñata-fractured heads. Instead of pulque, beer will run; instead of friends, compadres. Padrino (Godfather) will take requests. They have also invited the dead, Catalina and Antonia, fictitious portraits of Primancianita, to dance during the celebration. These illusory deceased are Juansonrisa’s lovers and also his victims, for he strangles them daily. Primancianita is hooked with Padrino-Presidente (Godfather-President) and wants to have sex with him. But the man of state is politically and carnally chaste. Tall. Güero (blond). Puts hands behind his back. Reads The Holy Bible. Goes to church after taking off his cassock. After washing his hands well. AfterPraying. AfterThinking of his madrecita santa (saintly mother). There is confusion between the real wedding of the protagonists and the imaginary wedding with Señor Presidente (Mister President) and with the baptism party to which a nonexistent priest attends. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Honeymoon in Cuernavaca. Primancianita affirms she was a virgin before marriage, and shows her red panties as proof. There is comic singing to virginity, as to the garter that will attract the love of our Señor Presidente. There is singing to the nation and the religious inquisitorial party, rambunctious institutional party, party that has ruled the country for many decades. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The opera concludes when Padrino-Presidente (Godfather-President) says that no one goes to the theater. What remains—beyond their fictional infidelities, beyond social conventions, beyond the games in which they pretend wanting to die and having wishes of killing one another—is the taste of the true love these two alcoholics feel for each other.</span></p>

Comic-Hemofiction Opera in two Acts Libretto by Juan Trigos Synister

Following
successful performances in Europe and Mexico, the Comic-Hemofiction opera DeCachetitoRaspado (CheekToStubbledCheek) will receive its United States premiere on October 28
and 29, 2015, at Georgia State University’s Rialto Center for the Arts.  This performance, co-produced by PromoMusica
International of Houston, Texas, and Bent Frequency, a contemporary chamber
music ensemble based in Atlanta, Georgia, will feature an international cast
which includes performers from Italy, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the United States,
and Venezuela.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This performance of
DeCachetitoRaspado is a co-production of PromoMusica International of
Houston, Texas, and Bent Frequency, a contemporary chamber music ensemble based
in Atlanta, Georgia. The cast includes:
composer and conductor Juan Trigos; stage director Luis Martín Solís; scenographer Luciano Trigos; mezzo-soprano
Amy Sheffer; baritone César Torruella; soprano Daniela D’Ingiullo; tenor
Esteban Cordero; co-choreographers, actresses and dancers Daniela Arroio and Anna Mariscal; the Zeitgeist Chorus directed by Deanna Joseph; and Bent
Frequency.  In the weeks preceding the
opera’s United States premiere, rehearsals will take place in Houston, Texas,
for the majority of the cast, who will then fly to Atlanta, Georgia, to join
the Zeitgeist Chorus and Bent Frequency. 
This schedule will allow us to involve the local communities of both
cities by arranging interviews with, and lectures by, the artists.
WHY THIS PROJECT?
Our goals in
pursuing this project are:

To promote Mexican culture


To pay homage to women


To celebrate the 50th
birthday of an important living composer.


WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
Thirty artists,
thrilled to share with you their passion for music and the arts, are involved
in this production, some of them talented young artists whose careers are being
launched by this endeavor.  So far, we
have raised $60,000 to cover airfare, lodging and meals, publicity, rental
fees, and a significant portion of the artists’s compensation.  Your support will enable us to design and
build the stage, make costumes, and pay the remaining portion of artists’ fees,
at an estimated cost of $10,000.
ABOUT THE OPERA
DeCachetitoRaspado is a Comic-Hemofiction opera
created by two extraordinary Mexican artists: 
Juan Trigos, composer and conductor; and Juan Trigos Synister [Senior], novelist,
playwright and librettist.  Through their
works, both artists engage with culturally relevant and significant social
themes, such as absence, alcohol and drug abuse, and women’s roles in the
household and in society, opening a door to their conscience, urging us to
reflect and to peek into the depths of our own.

Interview by Tom Moore on OPERA TODAY







WHAT IS HORROR-HEMOFICTION?
Horror-Hemoficción (Horror-Hemofiction) is a literary movement of search invented by Juan Trigos Synister, father of the composer. It reflects the characters in a multitude of mirrors in which they contemplate, frightened, the thousand faces of their personal infantilism. The protagonists, human children, play at being serious adults, but are murderers or full of lies. In every novel, play, or short story, infantile cruelty invades. Perhaps, someday, spiritual awakening will lead to maturity, which would mean plenary responsibility from which all characters created by Juan Trigos Synister—precisely because they are human, that is to say, children—run away. Horror-Hemoficción, always in jest, profound and amusing literature, opens doors to the personal conscience of the author and, by expansive reflection, is road towards the intimate knowledge of the reader who is capable of peeking into his or her own depths.



LIBRETTO BY JUAN TRIGOS SYNISTER SYNOPSIS

The central theme in the opera DeCachetitoRaspado (CheekToStubbledCheek) is the absence that the characters, Juansonrisa and Primancianita, fill up by projecting their imaginings. She is sterile, so she gives birth to two siamese sons who accompany them in all their theatrical improvisations. The story begins with the introduction of these beings of invention speaking about a baptism —imaginary as well—to which the president who has governed Mexico at diverse stages of the country’s life keeping the same criminal tendencies, will attend. Same imposing personality in collusion with the Church. There will be baptism with piñata-fractured heads. Instead of pulque, beer will run; instead of friends, compadres. Padrino (Godfather) will take requests. They have also invited the dead, Catalina and Antonia, fictitious portraits of Primancianita, to dance during the celebration. These illusory deceased are Juansonrisa’s lovers and also his victims, for he strangles them daily. Primancianita is hooked with Padrino-Presidente (Godfather-President) and wants to have sex with him. But the man of state is politically and carnally chaste. Tall. Güero (blond). Puts hands behind his back. Reads The Holy Bible. Goes to church after taking off his cassock. After washing his hands well. AfterPraying. AfterThinking of his madrecita santa (saintly mother). There is confusion between the real wedding of the protagonists and the imaginary wedding with Señor Presidente (Mister President) and with the baptism party to which a nonexistent priest attends. Honeymoon in Cuernavaca. Primancianita affirms she was a virgin before marriage, and shows her red panties as proof. There is comic singing to virginity, as to the garter that will attract the love of our Señor Presidente. There is singing to the nation and the religious inquisitorial party, rambunctious institutional party, party that has ruled the country for many decades. The opera concludes when Padrino-Presidente (Godfather-President) says that no one goes to the theater. What remains—beyond their fictional infidelities, beyond social conventions, beyond the games in which they pretend wanting to die and having wishes of killing one another—is the taste of the true love these two alcoholics feel for each other.

<div></div>
<p>In summer of 2014 while filming the Drama TV show for Starz Network “Flesh &amp; Bone” I traveled to Miami to start the writing process for my new EP with my friend writer/producer Chris Rodriguez. The project was then called “HAVE IT ALL”. </p>
<p>In July 2015, my new dance single mix ""Heart After Dark"" reached the #6 spot on the Music Weekly pop chart and #1 on the Kings of Spins radio chart in the UK. Thanks to the success of this track I have been working closely with Producer Mark Eddinger (Warner/Interscope/Sire/Universal) on developing the sound direction and planning a solid strategy for my career. Since then Mr. Eddinger has taken over the project and introduced me to world renowned artists, musicians, writers and producers including Grammy Award ™ winning producer and engineer Jason Corsaro (Duran Duran, Madonna), drummer phenomenon Steve Ferrone (Average White Band, Chaka Khan, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty &amp; The Heart Breakers, Duran Duran), singer Curtis King Jr. (Bruce Springsteen, Duran Duran) and co-writers Benjamin Samama and Rob Farren.</p>
<p>With money that I made as a dancer in Phantom of The Opera on Broadway, we started working on a new track, finding a very unique and strong new sound for the project. Unfortunately, financially our project came to a halt. Now I am at a crossroad and need some help with accomplishing the task of completing this project. I have also renamed the project after all the obstacles I have encountered. Today I call this EP “MUST” since no matter what, I always have a relentless conviction that I MUST make it happen and finish my EP. All I know is that the new songs and opportunities I have right now are here for a reason, there for I MUST find a way to do this! </p>
<p>My main goal is to record this new material, create a PR campaign for it, create a video and mini stage show and get out there. I grew up on stage and I can’t wait to be able to share my love for the arts &amp; music with the world. I hope you can feel my passion and conviction in making this happen, and together with you I KNOW IT CAN!</p>
<p>Anything is possible! You can make it possible!</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
</div>
<p>The only challenge that is standing in my way to complete this project is financial.</p>
<p>Since 2009 I have invested every spare dollar I have earned from performing and working on the Broadway stages on my own career. That money has helped me reach this point and enabled me to build a network and find the amazing group of world renowned artists and business minds I'm working with right now; <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This talented group of people is so excited about this project have already proved their success in the music &amp; entertainment world.

In summer of 2014 while filming the Drama TV show for Starz Network “Flesh & Bone” I traveled to Miami to start the writing process for my new EP with my friend writer/producer Chris Rodriguez. The project was then called “HAVE IT ALL”. 
In July 2015, my new dance single mix ""Heart After Dark"" reached the #6 spot on the Music Weekly pop chart and #1 on the Kings of Spins radio chart in the UK. Thanks to the success of this track I have been working closely with Producer Mark Eddinger (Warner/Interscope/Sire/Universal) on developing the sound direction and planning a solid strategy for my career. Since then Mr. Eddinger has taken over the project and introduced me to world renowned artists, musicians, writers and producers including Grammy Award ™ winning producer and engineer Jason Corsaro (Duran Duran, Madonna), drummer phenomenon Steve Ferrone (Average White Band, Chaka Khan, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty & The Heart Breakers, Duran Duran), singer Curtis King Jr. (Bruce Springsteen, Duran Duran) and co-writers Benjamin Samama and Rob Farren.
With money that I made as a dancer in Phantom of The Opera on Broadway, we started working on a new track, finding a very unique and strong new sound for the project. Unfortunately, financially our project came to a halt. Now I am at a crossroad and need some help with accomplishing the task of completing this project. I have also renamed the project after all the obstacles I have encountered. Today I call this EP “MUST” since no matter what, I always have a relentless conviction that I MUST make it happen and finish my EP. All I know is that the new songs and opportunities I have right now are here for a reason, there for I MUST find a way to do this! 
My main goal is to record this new material, create a PR campaign for it, create a video and mini stage show and get out there. I grew up on stage and I can’t wait to be able to share my love for the arts & music with the world. I hope you can feel my passion and conviction in making this happen, and together with you I KNOW IT CAN!
Anything is possible! You can make it possible!
Risks & Challenges
 

The only challenge that is standing in my way to complete this project is financial.
Since 2009 I have invested every spare dollar I have earned from performing and working on the Broadway stages on my own career. That money has helped me reach this point and enabled me to build a network and find the amazing group of world renowned artists and business minds I'm working with right now; This talented group of people is so excited about this project have already proved their success in the music & entertainment world. These highly sought after and highly paid individuals have all agreed to come together and make this project happen for pennies on the dollar of what they are usually paid because of their strong belief in me and my music and pure love for it. I can’t fail them now! This is all happening for a reason! Because of their belief and generosity we will be able to create 4-5 new tracks fully produced and mastered to highest of music industry standards. We can then begin the journey of releasing it worldwide and working out my live show and finding international labels and distribution support. My last dance single remix 'HEART AFTER DARK' reached #6 spot on the Music Week UK Commercial Pop Charts and # 1 on the Kings of Spins Radio Chart in the UK market, while also being picked up for licensing worldwide with labels including Lifted House in Scandinavia, Drizzly Music in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Tommy Boy Entertainment / Deepstate in North and South America and Freaktone in the UK. 
That’s the result on my very first formal campaign. I can't imagine what will happen when we finish this entire EP with these amazing new songs. One thing for sure is the sky is the limit and that I will never quit! We MUST make it happen!

I plan to spend some of my time there seeing famiy, learning about my father's life, seeing the places he grew up and visited, and through the experience learning about myself, attempting to fill the gap that I've always felt.

</div>A few words about the next Kaos Skola Festival :) All of those who joined us last year, have an idea of what to expect already, but we are hoping to see many new faces.<br/><br/>A bit about us: We are a small family, we live in the beautiful South of Sweden and we simply thought that we should use the freedom and space for something amazing and one of a kind, to bring creative people together and simply enjoy a good time. Music had to play a big role, it should be family-friendly, rather hyppyish, and some good food (100 % vegan) was on the plan…and that's exactly what we did. Our Expectations were totally topped, the Kaos Skola Festival 2015 was absolutely brilliant, wonderful and we can't resist repeating it.<br/><br/>All that not just for fun but for a good cause? Impossibe - nah…totally possible! We donated all profits to 2 charitable causes (an amazing 1200,-). And this will, of course, also be the case at the next festival. Maybe we can even top the amount? If you want to enter your organisation as a recipient of the profits, feel free to get in touch!<br/><br/>About the location: We have a yard of 5000 square meters, which offers a lot of space for many activities. It is quiet but not completely cut off. A 3 minute walk gets you to the lake for a nice swim.<br/><br/>Accommodation: Camping in our yard, on the neighbour's lawn, at the lake or in the forest. The choice is yours. We will also improve the sanitary facilities but please don't expect 5 stars ;)<br/><br/>Also: Dogs will be present, be prepared.<br/><br/>And: Kids until 12 yrs are free!<br/><br/><br/>                                                          *** Music ***<br/><br/> *** MATZE ROSSI *** JAWKNEE MUSIC *** TIGERYOUTH *** JOHN ALLEN***<br/><br/>                    *** MARCEL GEIN *** MATES *** AND:I *** CHAPLIN ***<br/><br/>*** ANDREAS LIEBERT *** CATCH: firefly *** NICOLE CARTER CASH ***<br/><br/>                        *** STEVEN&amp; STANLEY *** FREDDY FUDD PUCKER ***<br/><br/>                   ***LAUREN TUFNELL *** PHIL HUTZON *** *** BEN BARRITT ***<br/><br/>                                                 *** HERR LEHMANN ***<br/><br/>                                         *** ANDISOLO *** How I left ***<br/><br/> <b>                          Kaos Skola Festival 22.+23.

<div>My  name is Jasmine Crowe and I'm a singer and musician from Hawaii now living in sunny California. :) I grew up surrounded by music starting on violin at age three and began writing my own songs on piano and guitar as a teen. I started recording music at a young age and learned the ropes of music production as I grew more experienced with songwriting and with the music industry after moving to Los Angeles.</div>
<div>I've self produced all of my releases so far which you can check out here:</div>
<div><a href=""http://jasminecrowemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jasminecrowemusic.com</a></div>
<div><a href=""http://itunes.com/jasminecrowe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://itunes.com/jasminecrowe</a></div>
<div>Recently I've been featured in Music Connection Magazine, as the SingerUniverse Vocalist of the month, TAXI artist of the month and won several songwriting awards, placing in this year's American Songwriting Awards, UK Songwriting Contest and USA Songwriting Competition.</div>
<div>All of the support I've received for my music has meant so much to me! I love painting with sound and strive to make art and write meaningful songs that connect with people all around the world.</div>
<div>As an independent artist, all my songs are written, played, arranged and produced in my home studio by yours truly and with my partner and drummer Josh Carey. The only aspect of the production we don't do is mixing and mastering. As a musician, I pour my heart and soul into every song. It takes time, practice and dedication to the craft. Musicians don't become musicians for the money, we do it as a labor of love first and foremost and as a way to connect with others. Music is food for the soul.</div>
<div>Because of streaming and the accessibility of music on the internet, it is getting more and more difficult to make a living as an independent musician and songwriter. The gift I get as a musician is the the connection made with someone from a song that touched their heart.</div>
<div>With your help I'll be able to finish these new songs and continue making music to share with the world! </div>
<div><b>THE PERKS!</b></div>
</div><div>It costs around $500 to mix one song and $200 to master. For the production of my new songs I need to raise around $1,500 for the three songs I have yet to mix and $600 to master. If I do not reach my goal, all funds raised will still go towards production costs and will help me immensely!</div><div>I deeply appreciate every donation so as a thank you, here are some perks!</div><div><b>$2 - You'll get a download of my newest single DEADBEAT BOYFRIEND coming out this month!</b></div><div>

Over then years, we've opened for various successful bands, most notably Buzzcocks.

After the success of Tastes Like Funk, we really want to bring you more music to the same standard we're really happy with. What we're about...We're I Set The Sea On Fire (Billy, Pete, Meg & Josh). We've got the tracks together to record our first full length album, and we're really proud of the songs. We just need a little help funding the recording. All the money raised will go towards paying for a studio for a week. As some of you know, this can be very expensive and on top of university & living costs, we just don't see it being possible in the near future.Please dont think your moneys going to waste, we've been a band for around 5 years, and we are extremely passionate about music, and take the band very seriously. Over then years, we've opened for various successful bands, most notably Buzzcocks. We've also played many festivals & prestigious venues around the UK. If you've got the money, we'd really appreciate anything you can give, but if not we're musicians, we know what its like to be skint. Thanks for all your support so far, and we wont let you down. Billy, Pete, Josh & Meg (ISTSOF) x",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

By the end of the video, she has become every single one of her vision board images - the singer on stage, the actress strutting the red carpet, and the high fashion model featured in a big campaign.

The festival has been run by award-winning Bohém Ragtime Jazz Band and its leader, Tamás Ittzés since 1992 thus we are celebrating our 25th jubilee in 2016. We invite some of the very best Ragtime and Classic Jazz performers of the world every year and this year we have a special selection of those who had been the most popular over the previous 24 years. (Performers include singer Catherine Russell from New York, the Bratislava Hot Serenaders from Slovakia, ""Queen of Ragtime"" Mimi Blais from Canada, a 6-piece Festival All Stars (of Dutch, French, Norwegian and Hungarian jazz musicians) and two of the top jazz bands of Hungary: Hot Jazz Band and the host Bohém Ragtime Jazz Band.)</p>
<p>The event was the very first of all jazz festivals to provide live streaming for the entire festival in 2009 and has been offering this free service since then. We want to continue this tradition but our festival budget is too limited to offer it this year, too. However, with your help it could be easily done again and we would LOVE to show you and other jazz lovers one of the greatest and friendliest festivals (labels of such have been very common by both performers and audience members).</p>

It's not much (Hungary is still a cheap country compared to many others) but it is beyond the festival's budget this year. (FYI: the festival's complete budget without the online streaming is 35,000 EUR / over 38,000 USD.) We'd love to provide this service free for as many as possible but we need to secure ourselves in advance that's why we need your help.

<p>You can contribute amounts from 20 to 100 EUR and besides providing the webcast, we'll send you recordings and stuff. You can even get the WHOLE festival recorded so you don't have to watch it live.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of 1500 EUR then we take whatever we gain and use it for the webcast. In this case we are losing money but we are hoping for the best and trust that this will not be the scenario.</p>

    El impacto
 ENG. With the sale of their albums, the “Ensamble Moxos” sustains the Music School of San Ignacio, where about 200 children and teenagers from low-income, mostly indigenous, receive free musical education. In fact, the ensemble is composed of the very young teachers of the School and its most outstanding students. The moxeños have maintained for centuries its authentic and extraordinary, hidden and ignored cultural events. Twenty years ago when we witnessed the latest generation of musicians, violinists and singers School of Music and the Assembly Moxos emerged through them several generations of musicians are being trained and their music, their culture is rescued and reinvigorated. The moxeños today write their own history with music and have a place in the world.

Thanks for visiting my campaign page to raise funds for ""It Just Takes One,"" a one-woman musical revue with my original script set to the tunes of Rossini, Mozart, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Stephen Schwartz, and so many more! </p>
<p>After 2 workshops, and a 6-show premiere in Bloomington, IL in 2013, I've revised the script and layout, have my own traveling set and costumes, and am now ready to take the show on the road! </p>
<p>This show is very near and dear to my heart; I wrote the script based on my personal experiences starting a career singing opera, all the while learning to find myself and figuring out the world of dating in between. With a strong background in music and outreach, I have witnessed the ability to really make a difference with music through intimate and heartfelt performances. I'm honored to share a small slice of my own story partnered with gorgeous musical selections spanning the eras. </p>
<p>Your donation today will help make ""It Just Takes One"" a first-rate production, from the traveling set to the costumes and lighting and sound, and will ensure future productions of this charming and at-times-poignant show. Additionally, funding will help me benefit the communities I visit. In Cincinnati, I will be donating 10% of all profits raised to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Charitable Care Fund; I will meet with highschool and college-aged students in both Streator, IL and Cincinnati, OH who are interested in learning more about pursuing a career in music. </p>
<p>Truly, any donation, great or small, will make a difference! Thank you for your support. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Breakdown of funding</h3> <p>I have really worked to make ""It Just Takes One"" a fully-sustainable show, while keeping costs at the lowest overhead possible. </p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of expenses associated with the show: </p>
<p><b>FLAT RATE COSTS:</b></p>
<p>Cost of Set: <b>$900</b></p>
<p>5 flats, 4 platforms, 10 blocks, 1 set bed; I was only charged for the building materials. Additionally, I have a secondary light-weight set-up for homes and very small venues made of PVC piping and curtains. This cost includes those materials, plus the paint, canvas, hinges, glue, and lumber for the large set. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Commissioned Work: <b>$200</b></p>
<p>I have commissioned living composer, Ann Jacobs, to write an original composition to be used for the finale bow music. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Custom-made Traveling Trailer: <b>$4,500</b></p>
<p>This trailer is custom-built to haul the show's set and accessories, featuring a fully-functional, streamlined and water-tight design. The above cost includes building materials, brake lights, license plate, and a portion of the labor costs to build the trailer. (Remaining costs for labor was donated by Larry Tombaugh. See ""In Kind Donations"" below). </p>
<p>Costumes: <b>$300</b></p>
<p>I was able to keep costs down by using mostly my own existing performance wardrobe for costumes for the show. However, with the help of the very talented costume designer Brianna Fristoe, I will have several ""adapted"" pieces to better facilitate quick costume changes and a few pieces that have been ""upgraded"" for the stage. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Theatrical Body Microphone: <b>$322</b></p>
<p>This E6i Omnidirectional Headworn Microphone Earset allows me hands-free movement while onstage, and expedites all those quick changes behind stage-once it's set in place, no fussing or fidgeting needed. The version is adaptable to hook up to the various sound systems available at the venues.</p>Sound Recording Costs : <b>$750 </b>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">CD Production Costs: </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">$800</b><br/>
</div><div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We will be making a CD recording of ""It Just Takes One"" for promotional purposes and for future sales. Additionally, donors giving $500 and more will automatically receive an autographed CD. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The CDs will be professionally duplicated and manufactured and available for sale.</span><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><b>Lighting: $600</b></div><div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>I purchased a pack of stage lighting equipment that includes 8 PAR 38 cans, a dimmer system, stage setter controller, 2 cables, 2 dimmers, 4 colored gels, and a truss-style lighting stand that can stand alone or connect for professional and very stable mounting. This set allows flexibility for growth and more in-depth lighting as we continue producing in the future. </p>
<p><b>ROLLING COSTS (these costs will recur for each additional show; below are the total sums for the shows in Streator, IL and Cincinnati, OH): </b></p>
<p>Licensing costs: <b>$130-$150 per show</b></p>
<p>13 of my 26 musical compositions and excerpts require per song per show licensing fees. Many of these licensing fees are supporting living composers. The remaining 13 pieces are public domain. </p>
<p>Pianist Fees: <b>$1100 </b></p>
<p>I have found two extremely talented pianists in Nancy Pounds (IL) and Stephen Variames (OH) who are adept in all the musical styles and terrific collaborators. This cost includes their sum engagement fees, plus all the rehearsal expenses while preparing for the two state openings. </p>
<p>Sound Technician Fees: TBD</p>
<p>Lighting Technician Fees: TBD</p>
<p>Advertising Costs: <b>$600</b></p>
<p>This includes the fees for: hiring a graphic designer to custom create all the promotional materials for both the Streator and Cincinnati shows, the printing costs for posters, handouts, and postcards, mailing costs, and fees for advertising in the local newspapers. </p>
<p><b>FUTURE ""WISH LIST"" COSTS:</b></p>
<p>*Ellipsoidal Spotlight to be added to lighting setup ($200-$400) </p>
<p>*LED Lightbulbs for 8 Par Cans (more sustainable and long-lasting) ($22x10=$220)</p>
<p>*Lawyer fees for assistance with creating non-profit 501-c3 status ($1,500) <br/></p>
<p>* Fees for filing and establishing a non-profit with the US government ($400-$600) <br/></p>
<p>* For now, I will be borrowing a truck or hauling the show trailer, set pieces, and lighting equipment behind my 2004 Honda Accord. In the future, I hope to own a reliable truck or van with good hauling power for these performances of ""It Just Takes One"" and other future productions. ($8-$15,000+)<br/></p>

</div></div>","About Kate Tombaugh and ""It Just Takes One"" Hi, my name is Kate Tombaugh! Thanks for visiting my campaign page to raise funds for ""It Just Takes One,"" a one-woman musical revue with my original script set to the tunes of Rossini, Mozart, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Stephen Schwartz, and so many more! 
After 2 workshops, and a 6-show premiere in Bloomington, IL in 2013, I've revised the script and layout, have my own traveling set and costumes, and am now ready to take the show on the road! 
This show is very near and dear to my heart; I wrote the script based on my personal experiences starting a career singing opera, all the while learning to find myself and figuring out the world of dating in between. With a strong background in music and outreach, I have witnessed the ability to really make a difference with music through intimate and heartfelt performances. I'm honored to share a small slice of my own story partnered with gorgeous musical selections spanning the eras. 
Your donation today will help make ""It Just Takes One"" a first-rate production, from the traveling set to the costumes and lighting and sound, and will ensure future productions of this charming and at-times-poignant show. Additionally, funding will help me benefit the communities I visit. In Cincinnati, I will be donating 10% of all profits raised to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Charitable Care Fund; I will meet with highschool and college-aged students in both Streator, IL and Cincinnati, OH who are interested in learning more about pursuing a career in music. 
Truly, any donation, great or small, will make a difference! Thank you for your support.    Breakdown of funding I have really worked to make ""It Just Takes One"" a fully-sustainable show, while keeping costs at the lowest overhead possible. 
Here is the breakdown of expenses associated with the show: 
FLAT RATE COSTS:
Cost of Set: $900
5 flats, 4 platforms, 10 blocks, 1 set bed; I was only charged for the building materials. Additionally, I have a secondary light-weight set-up for homes and very small venues made of PVC piping and curtains. This cost includes those materials, plus the paint, canvas, hinges, glue, and lumber for the large set. 

Commissioned Work: $200
I have commissioned living composer, Ann Jacobs, to write an original composition to be used for the finale bow music. 

Custom-made Traveling Trailer: $4,500
This trailer is custom-built to haul the show's set and accessories, featuring a fully-functional, streamlined and water-tight design. The above cost includes building materials, brake lights, license plate, and a portion of the labor costs to build the trailer. (Remaining costs for labor was donated by Larry Tombaugh. See ""In Kind Donations"" below). 
Costumes: $300
I was able to keep costs down by using mostly my own existing performance wardrobe for costumes for the show. However, with the help of the very talented costume designer Brianna Fristoe, I will have several ""adapted"" pieces to better facilitate quick costume changes and a few pieces that have been ""upgraded"" for the stage. 

Theatrical Body Microphone: $322
This E6i Omnidirectional Headworn Microphone Earset allows me hands-free movement while onstage, and expedites all those quick changes behind stage-once it's set in place, no fussing or fidgeting needed. The version is adaptable to hook up to the various sound systems available at the venues.Sound Recording Costs : $750 

CD Production Costs: $800

We will be making a CD recording of ""It Just Takes One"" for promotional purposes and for future sales. Additionally, donors giving $500 and more will automatically receive an autographed CD. The CDs will be professionally duplicated and manufactured and available for sale.
Lighting: $600

I purchased a pack of stage lighting equipment that includes 8 PAR 38 cans, a dimmer system, stage setter controller, 2 cables, 2 dimmers, 4 colored gels, and a truss-style lighting stand that can stand alone or connect for professional and very stable mounting. This set allows flexibility for growth and more in-depth lighting as we continue producing in the future. 
ROLLING COSTS (these costs will recur for each additional show; below are the total sums for the shows in Streator, IL and Cincinnati, OH): 
Licensing costs: $130-$150 per show
13 of my 26 musical compositions and excerpts require per song per show licensing fees. Many of these licensing fees are supporting living composers. The remaining 13 pieces are public domain. 
Pianist Fees: $1100 
I have found two extremely talented pianists in Nancy Pounds (IL) and Stephen Variames (OH) who are adept in all the musical styles and terrific collaborators. This cost includes their sum engagement fees, plus all the rehearsal expenses while preparing for the two state openings. 
Sound Technician Fees: TBD
Lighting Technician Fees: TBD
Advertising Costs: $600
This includes the fees for: hiring a graphic designer to custom create all the promotional materials for both the Streator and Cincinnati shows, the printing costs for posters, handouts, and postcards, mailing costs, and fees for advertising in the local newspapers. 
FUTURE ""WISH LIST"" COSTS:
*Ellipsoidal Spotlight to be added to lighting setup ($200-$400) 
*LED Lightbulbs for 8 Par Cans (more sustainable and long-lasting) ($22x10=$220)
*Lawyer fees for assistance with creating non-profit 501-c3 status ($1,500) 
* Fees for filing and establishing a non-profit with the US government ($400-$600) 
* For now, I will be borrowing a truck or hauling the show trailer, set pieces, and lighting equipment behind my 2004 Honda Accord. In the future, I hope to own a reliable truck or van with good hauling power for these performances of ""It Just Takes One"" and other future productions. ($8-$15,000+)

This is possible because the ground temperature can be used to cool a structure if the air temperature is hotter than the local ambient ground temperature.  This cooling effect will also cut water loss from evaporation.  Lucky for me, I'm in Austin Texas and it is both arid and hot.  I want to start a small scale industrial walipini, putting my knowledge of landscaping with my love of plants and fresh food.  This will put fresh, local produce within walking distance of thousands of Austinites.  It will also be carbon negative, and oxygen positive.  Another positive side product will be high quality soil, since I will be using the Bokashi compost fermentation technique.  The main effect of this project will be a beautiful place for neighbors to gather and get their veggies at a fraction of the cost of any store.  </span><br/>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also need quite a bit of equipment including a skid steer or mini excavator (or both) and the materials to do the actual construction of the underground garden, including thousands of landscaping and retaining wall stack blocks.  I have to plan to possibly employ solar power, as some building sites don't have power accessible.  Also, equipment such as shovels and gloves will be necessary.  If we go the route of veggie delivery, we need a vehicle.  We also require a web presence with the ability for customers to place orders and a shopping cart.</p>

<p>At this point I'd like to point out two of the major costs in having a greenhouse.  One being electricity.  The cost of heating a greenhouse in the winter gets outrageous.  Utilizing the warmth of the earth at this latitude will eliminate that cost. Of course when you have a greenhouse, you run the risk of your plants catching diseases, and pests.  I can fight this by using bokashi method fertilization to keep the soil healthy, but the risk is still there. Note that the bokashi fertilizer will be made on-site from food waste, another major cost saver. Using predator insects helps with the pests, along with directly spraying with a castile soap/water mix, which is another way to save money and to keep from using chemicals. Daily monitoring of the garden will help, but no one is perfect.  Another risk is flooding, as a lot of the property I have in mind is in the flood plain.  But lucky for me, the stack blocks I plan to build the structure from can be re-stacked, and the plants can be re-grown. There is also the risk of neighborhoods not wanting a greenhouse, or the City of Austin not jiving with my idea.  I plan to do more research as time and money allow, but I know Austin well enough to say they would accept the idea with open arms.  If not, I will be seeking property outside of city limits and leaning towards a web based veggie delivery service.</p>

Non-consensual behavior is a problem at kinky & BDSM events. Last year professional pervert and sexual health educator Maxine Holloway worked with the BDSM & kink, and sex worker community to initiate the ASK FIRST Campaign. The goal is to create awareness about consent in public spaces. The campaign consists of fashionable stickers and temporary tattoos that read, “ASK FIRST,”  as well as a tumblr blog for anyone to post stories, thoughts, and photos regarding consent in public spaces.
Last year we successfully fundraised to get 2000 stickers and tattoos printed and distributed at last years Folsom Street fair. Not only were these simple stickers a wonderful reminder, but they served as an tool when people were negotiating pervy acts and getting permission to take a photograph.
The ASK FIRST campaign keeps growing! Since inception these stickers & tattoos have been all over the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York City.

Check out the Eros Media Blog to learn more about the ASK FIRST origin story, PLUS tips to help you be an asking expert the Folsom Street Fair:




How we want it to grow... Let's take the ASK FIRST Campaign to the NEXT LEVEL. The Folsom Street Fair has generously donated a booth to ASK FIRST. But I need your help to build it and fill it!

Our Goals:


Arm the guests of Folsom with at least 10,000 ASK FIRST stickers and temporary tattoos

To fill the booth with a team of babes ready to inform and illustrate just how good consent can look. This will entail:                                                                                -3 interactive BDSM performances                                                                                      --An ASK FIRST photo-booth where you can get your photo taken with your fav Bay Area kink & porn performers. 


Provide tangible take away information about how the BDSM community can stop perpetuating rape culture

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Nitty Gritty</u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528128168/tyfig078buhsyjpgxle8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hey, guys! My name is Calvin Winbush, I perform under the name Calvin The II. I've been playing music all of my life, but 5 years ago I stepped out to be a music artist. Since then I've performed around the world and have been able to work with an AMAZING team of artist/musicians/dancers and directors. As an actor I've appeared in some amazing productions such as ""Whiplash,"" ""Nashville,"" ""New Girl,"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"" as well as a ton of music videos.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Recently, both of those world collided when I appeared as the guitarist in the critically-acclaimed music video ""This is America"" by Childish Gambino.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYOjWnS4cMY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The video was more successful than I ever would have imagined and made it possible for me to release my first official single as a recording artist, ""Keepa""! (You can hear it playing under the main campaign video). However, with any music release, you need to have a strong visual to help carry the song further and really make an impact. Which is why we're asking for help to shoot this video.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is huge to me because after being on set working on so many talented artist's music videos, I'm finally getting the chance to do one of my own! It's literally a dream come true and I DON'T take it for granted. When I first became an artist, I had NO idea what I was doing and put a lot of time and effort into a project that didn't go anywhere. I remember being so drained and disappointed to the point that I almost quit music all together.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is a LOT different now that I have a great team of people to help guide me, which is a blessing. Having an amazing music video of my own allows me the opportunity to establish myself as a serious artist as well as ensure the success of the single ""Keepa."" It can not only open up relationships, but also touring  and festival opportunities for myself and my entire team.<br/><br/>In short, this video, just like ""This is America"" can help change our lives forever!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Deets</u></h2>
<p>The great thing about being in ""This is America"" is that I've been cemented in history as a character in one of the most interesting and thought-provoking music videos of all time. The challenging thing about it is.... the bar is set SO dang high for my own video now!!! <br/><br/>I'm not dumb and would in NO way try to compete with ""This is America,"" but what I also won't do is shame Donald, Hiro, Fam, Jason and everyone else who worked on that production by releasing something that is sub par, lol. They taught me better than that!<br/><br/>By calling in favors and making a ton of phone calls to my producers, director my director and myself have come up with an awesome treatment and humble budget of $8,000 for ""Keepa"".</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will go towards equipment as well as compensating the cast and crew and feeding them. Some of the items include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>DP and Camera Equipment (Arri Alexa Mini)</li>
<li>Lens Kit (Cooke Lenses)</li>
<li>Lighting Kit</li>
<li>Color Correction</li>
<li>Location Fees</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Filming Permits</li>
<li>Catered Food for Lunch</li>
<li>Hair and Makeup</li>
<li>Set Decorations</li>
<li>Wardrobe</li>
<li>Stylist</li>
<li>Grips/AC/Gaffer/ AD</li>
<li>Dancers</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I think my favorite part of constructing this campaign has been thinking up the perks! Lol, I have some amazing supporters so I wanted to be sure the perks were as interesting as you guys are!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/><u>The Song</u>
</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The song ""Keepa"" came to be in December. I had just performed for Cricket Wireless and got a little TOO excited and damaged my vocal chords. I was upset, and then out of nowhere, a producer I had been trying to work with for THE ENTIRE YEAR hits me up and says, ""Hey, let's go to the studio!"" I tried to get out of it because at that point all I could do was hum and grunt.<br/><br/>That music producer was <strong>Mike Dupree </strong>and thankfully he persisted. I go to the studio and in two hours, ""Keepa"" was born. The reason why I'm singing so low and smooth in it is because that's ALL I could muster out, but it ended up working.<br/><br/>The song is a love letter to women who come into your life and instantly let you know they're someone who you shouldn't let go of easily. From the moment we're born until the day we die, guys are molded by the women in their lives. This song celebrates the moment we realize how amazing the women in our lives really are.<br/><br/>That being said, it makes me proud that the crew for the music video is mostly women. From the producer to the creative director to the graphic designer and the talent, this music video wouldn't have happened without all of the amazing women involved.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Squad</u></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">What makes me confident enough about this song and music video to ask you guys for help is my AMAZING team that helped me to get here. They are some of the most talented group of individuals I've ever met. For whatever reason, I'm able to call these people and tell them my crazy ideas and they put their professional resources together for my sake, lol.</p>

</div></div>","The Nitty Gritty

Hey, guys! My name is Calvin Winbush, I perform under the name Calvin The II. I've been playing music all of my life, but 5 years ago I stepped out to be a music artist. Since then I've performed around the world and have been able to work with an AMAZING team of artist/musicians/dancers and directors. As an actor I've appeared in some amazing productions such as ""Whiplash,"" ""Nashville,"" ""New Girl,"" and ""Straight Outta Compton"" as well as a ton of music videos.
Recently, both of those world collided when I appeared as the guitarist in the critically-acclaimed music video ""This is America"" by Childish Gambino.

 
The video was more successful than I ever would have imagined and made it possible for me to release my first official single as a recording artist, ""Keepa""! (You can hear it playing under the main campaign video). However, with any music release, you need to have a strong visual to help carry the song further and really make an impact. Which is why we're asking for help to shoot this video.
This is huge to me because after being on set working on so many talented artist's music videos, I'm finally getting the chance to do one of my own! It's literally a dream come true and I DON'T take it for granted. When I first became an artist, I had NO idea what I was doing and put a lot of time and effort into a project that didn't go anywhere. I remember being so drained and disappointed to the point that I almost quit music all together.
This is a LOT different now that I have a great team of people to help guide me, which is a blessing. Having an amazing music video of my own allows me the opportunity to establish myself as a serious artist as well as ensure the success of the single ""Keepa."" It can not only open up relationships, but also touring  and festival opportunities for myself and my entire team.In short, this video, just like ""This is America"" can help change our lives forever!
 

The Deets
The great thing about being in ""This is America"" is that I've been cemented in history as a character in one of the most interesting and thought-provoking music videos of all time. The challenging thing about it is.... the bar is set SO dang high for my own video now!!! I'm not dumb and would in NO way try to compete with ""This is America,"" but what I also won't do is shame Donald, Hiro, Fam, Jason and everyone else who worked on that production by releasing something that is sub par, lol. They taught me better than that!By calling in favors and making a ton of phone calls to my producers, director my director and myself have come up with an awesome treatment and humble budget of $8,000 for ""Keepa"".
The funds from this campaign will go towards equipment as well as compensating the cast and crew and feeding them. Some of the items include, but are not limited to:

DP and Camera Equipment (Arri Alexa Mini)
Lens Kit (Cooke Lenses)
Lighting Kit
Color Correction
Location Fees
Insurance
Filming Permits
Catered Food for Lunch
Hair and Makeup
Set Decorations
Wardrobe
Stylist
Grips/AC/Gaffer/ AD
Dancers

I think my favorite part of constructing this campaign has been thinking up the perks! Lol, I have some amazing supporters so I wanted to be sure the perks were as interesting as you guys are!

The Vision





The Song

The song ""Keepa"" came to be in December. I had just performed for Cricket Wireless and got a little TOO excited and damaged my vocal chords. I was upset, and then out of nowhere, a producer I had been trying to work with for THE ENTIRE YEAR hits me up and says, ""Hey, let's go to the studio!"" I tried to get out of it because at that point all I could do was hum and grunt.That music producer was Mike Dupree and thankfully he persisted. I go to the studio and in two hours, ""Keepa"" was born. The reason why I'm singing so low and smooth in it is because that's ALL I could muster out, but it ended up working.The song is a love letter to women who come into your life and instantly let you know they're someone who you shouldn't let go of easily. From the moment we're born until the day we die, guys are molded by the women in their lives. This song celebrates the moment we realize how amazing the women in our lives really are.That being said, it makes me proud that the crew for the music video is mostly women. From the producer to the creative director to the graphic designer and the talent, this music video wouldn't have happened without all of the amazing women involved.
 

The Squad
What makes me confident enough about this song and music video to ask you guys for help is my AMAZING team that helped me to get here. They are some of the most talented group of individuals I've ever met. For whatever reason, I'm able to call these people and tell them my crazy ideas and they put their professional resources together for my sake, lol.

Calvin: To put it frankly, Reyna and her non-profit, 2 LIVVV are one of the BIGGEST reasons this is happening! 2 LIVVV has not only helped to make this possible with their resources, but also time, consulting and flat-out MOTIVATING me to keep going! She's a walking blessing.

The Testimony
I'll never get enough of shouting out my team. Anyone who ever did more than they were required to for any part of my dream is a vital part of my team and I appreciate you with all my heart.

<h3>A Bold Concept Album</h3>
<p>We live in an America where children shoot each other.  As a former broadcast journalist, Producer Peter Vadala believes that media is a big part of the problem, but that it goes much deeper.</p>
<p>""It was never like this,"" Vadala says. </p>
<p>The story behind the Fall Concept Album is about a girl who falls through a hole in the ice, into an androgynous underworld where men aren't men, so women can't be women.</p>
<p>But Vadala promises a happy ending.  ""The story elates listeners we've heard from on every level, because It's a concept album, in the truest sense.""</p>
<p>And Vadala would know, because he brings a lifetime of combined performing arts experience to the project.  Grammy-nominated Fall music producer and orchestrator Carl Marsh calls it musically interesting.</p>
<p>And so while this Indiegogo campaign is a humble one, with the aim of finishing a demo recording which you see in the video, it's one small step toward telling the much larger story.</p>
<p>""Art can do what political bickering and Fake News can't,"" Vadala says.  ""The people who write and announce the news are really great at regurgitating infinite quantities of insidious trivia, but they lose focus of what it all means, and with it, their sanity.  If we're not careful, we'll become just like them.</p>
<p>""Free from the shackles of the Fake News anchor desk, I can tell a true story that brings out the very best in my audience, and in myself.  Without the cheesy news music, and the odd folks at the Associated Press,  I can write better news music, for instance, as a composer, lyricist, director.  As a storyteller, in this medium, I can tell a truer story all around.</p>
<p>""I hold everybody on my team to only the highest standards of excellence - most of all, myself.  Because content - is for milk cartons.  We here at the Fall Concept Album create contentedness.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help with a very simple goal - to cover some modest cost over-runs from our recent demo recording in Berlin.  <strong>We'll show our thanks by sharing the exclusive demo recording of the Fall Concept Album's titular song with you, for your contribution of $10 or more.  But wait!  There's more!  </strong></p>

<li><strong>You also get a free copy of the Waltz demo when you claim the $10 perk!</strong></li>
<li><strong>We're taking your requests right now!</strong></li>
<li>Our total costs to finish the demo are only about $1,200</li>
<li>The ambitious concept album spans the most diverse variety of popular music ever, all while telling a consistent story from beginning to end.  You'll start to hear that in the two demo songs, where within the span of about four minutes each, the music spans the genre spectrum from an orchestral waltz all the way to muted punk rock, with an emphasis on cutting-edge, Broadway-busting style storytelling and character arc.</li>
<li>We went all the way to Berlin, Germany to conduct the recording because that's where opera appreciation still thrives.  Sashell Beck recorded the demo pro bono.  Vadala auditioned many sopranos you've heard of from the pop world, however, he realized that in a project spanning both opera and pop, and everything in between - that it would be much easier to train a conservatory opera singer to sing pop than to go the other way around.  The recording session was expensive in that regard, but worth it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Putting the ""Culture"" Back In Pop Culture</h3>
<ul>
<li>You'll help raise the bar of popular culture in America, and by extension, the world.  Musically, morally, spiritually, really in every way that culture can be edified.</li>
<li>You'll help remind the world why sexy - real sexy - that is, authentic masculinity and femininity - is important; and moreover, why authentic femininity is worth cherishing and edifying.</li>

<li>Peter Vadala says he believes that by creating the right kind of art, perhaps, just perhaps, he says that perhaps children won't shoot each other as they do now, in this highly triggered world we live in.  Vadala attributes those triggers to media conditioning, and he says this work will help to reveal how and why media conditions people, citing C.S. Lewis:  <a href=""http://thinkexist.com/quotation/a_man_with_an_obsession_is_a_man_who_has_very/147339.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“A man with an obsession is a man who has very little sales resistance</a>""(Mere Christianity).</li>

In a live setting we craft our setlist, stage presence and dynamics to suit a wide range of shows and crowds, <strong>often making fans who have never heard of post-hardcore</strong>, and even folks who don’t much enjoy rock music in general!

Styles range from richly textured atmospherics to jarring stutter-step rhythms, saucy grooves to delicate intertwining melodies, while the compositions run the gambit from dense prog-rock epics, to whole songs built on four chords.To fully realize our vision for this album, we knew that we had to hire the best. Recorded at The Panda Studios in Fremont, CA (www.thepandastudios.com); tracked, edited, mixed and co-produced by Jeremy ""The Wizard"" Wurst of Coyote Face Recording (www.coyotefacerecording.com); mastered by the illustrious Troy Glessner of Spectre Studios (www.facebook.com/spectremastering) who's brought to life such classics as Underoath's They're Only Chasing Safety and Emery's The Question; and with stunning album art by the insanely talented Abby Lessick (www.abbylessick.com), a sample of which is featured above, Instability has exceeded our highest expectations, and we're tremendously excited to share it with you!However, hiring the best has also proven to be extremely expensive, totaling well over $10K, and has all but exhausted our monetary resources. We always have and always will invest everything we have into our music, but we need your help to complete the last few steps to releasing the record! We're asking for $2,500, which would:
offset $1,500 worth of mixing and production fees
cover all $650 in mastering fees
cover $350 for distribution of CD's and incentive fulfillment
Any additional funds above and beyond our goal will be put towards the rice-and-beans fund for our upcoming Winter tour through the Pacific Northwest! In addition, we're offering certain donation incentives, many of which are exclusive to those who support our campaign! Everyone who donates any amount will get a free download of our first single from the record, Steam (to be released on November 2nd). Some other IndieGoGo exclusives are:

behind the scenes footage from our upcoming music video

Enso will cover your favorite anime theme song

Enso will write a song about you (content and genre of your choice)
Tyler (our bassist) will get a tattoo of your choice 
Whitney (our rhythm guitarist) will make a homecooked meal for you and a friend
and of course... a blow-up clown, with a blend of all of our faces on it... if you're into that sort of thing!
Enso’s aim in creating Instability is to bring fans of diverse backgrounds together through our common humanity, the spirit of adventure and feelings of wonder and curiosity which lie somewhere within each one of us. We’ve crafted this record to appeal to folks of many musical tastes by giving each a sample of what they already love, then gently coaxing them to explore, to embrace new knowledge, experience and growth.This is not only our mission statement with this record, but an integral part of how we function as a band. In a live setting we craft our setlist, stage presence and dynamics to suit a wide range of shows and crowds, often making fans who have never heard of post-hardcore, and even folks who don’t much enjoy rock music in general! One of our greatest joys is to begin playing to a room of people chatting casually, and to finish our set holding the audience in rapt attention, transfixed by the changes simultaneously taking place in the music they hear, and within themselves.Creating this album has been one of the most monumental challenges of our lives, and we are extremely close to being able to share this labor of love with the world. The recordings are complete, the mixing and mastering have been honed to precision and exacting detail, the album art and design are nearly complete, and we are poised to order CD's and distribute these songs all across the world. All that remains is your contribution which makes all of that possible!Lastly, even if you can't contribute monetarily, you can still help out by spreading the word about this campaign, the album and our upcoming tour. Every time you tell your friends and loved ones, every time you share this campaign on social media, you make an invaluable contribution to the success of our dream. We couldn't have gotten this far without you, and we're honored and grateful to receive your contribution, even if this is your first time hearing about Enso Anima and you've just read to the end of this post.Because YOU are Enso Anima. And we are not alone.- Nick, Tyler, Shane and Whitney",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Today we may know them as <u><strong>HYMNS</strong></u>--they were contemporary in their day but have now passed into the background generally, and are mostly sung in more conservative Christian circles these days. Some of these amazing messages and melodies have managed to move on into our present day, but there are many that have not, and I find that a real shame. I think we’re incomplete without the expressions and thoughts from other believers who have gone before us, and that it is a wealth that needs to be preserved.</p><p>Many of these songs have truly enriched my spirit and enhanced my walk with Jesus over the years, even rescuing me on a number of occasion from severe testing and difficult situations I found myself in. So I want to give them room to speak to us again at this time in our history, to  give us strength and courage to move ahead in spite of the tough places we find ourselves in. <u><strong>This is the MAIN THRUST of the project, since these songs are already written</strong></u>.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>""SOMETHING NEW""</strong></u><strong>:</strong></p><p>I love to write or receive new messages drawn from my own personal growth and day to day life for Jesus. I’ve offered many of them on <strong>my music site <u>jerrypaladino.bandcamp.com</u></strong>, alongside other beautiful <i><strong>‘gems’ </strong></i>that I have found in my travels and life abroad. I sense in the depth of my being an on-going commission by Him to <strong>continue writing and receiving new songs based on all I’m learning and experiencing</strong>—I have a list of themes and topics which grows by the day, and at this moment I have at least 8 songs in the pipeline <strong>in both English and Spanish</strong> that I'd like to get out and into finalized recordings. </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>THE OVER-ARCHING GOAL:</h3><p>I plan to focus on recording <u><strong>10-12 traditional hymns over the next 10 months</strong></u>, accompanied by <strong>a few new songs of my own composition</strong>. I’ll be shooting for a balance of releasing <u><strong>1 new composition for every 3 hymns recorded</strong></u> if possible. I have a unique opportunity to travel and ‘test’ them on audiences around the world in my musical ministry, which is one reason why I’m spreading the timetable over 10 months--part of these next 10 months I'll be away from home, using in that public ministry this material along with the other treasures you find on my site. </p><p> </p><h3>
<u><strong>YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong></u>:</h3><ul><li>
<u><strong>will help make this project possible</strong></u>, for which I am so very grateful.

<p>We know this will be the greatest album we have created yet. We know that with your support we won't have to take any shortcuts like we have in the past.

<h3>PASSION OF THE HEIST II</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541276195/choan7csgrxcfhenczet.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Passion of the Heist II is a conceptual album that directly follows the story from the original Passion of the Heist. In the original EP you followed the story of a man being abducted by extraterrestrials and transformed into their leader only to lead an invasion against humanity. The album ended when the invasion began. </p>
<p>This new album tells the story of the invasion from two distinct characters perspectives. Half of the songs are from the perspective of the character from the original EP (The Ultraterrestrial), and the other half of the songs are from a new characters perspective. This character is a desperate and broken man who vows to save humanity. </p>
<p>Musically this is our most progressive and challenging album to date. We are writing the songs to fit the story of the lyrics. We are trying to create a cinematic experience through an audio outlet. And of course we're making this our heaviest, shreddiest, most soulful, and powerful album to date.</p>
<p>We plan on having some friends perform guest spots throughout the album. So there will also be some vocals and instrumental work spread throughout the album from other artists that you already know and love. Not to mention that Chris Turner from Oceans Ate Alaska will be writing and recording all of the drums on the album! </p>
<p>Passion of the Heist II is going to be our most ambitious album to date. And we cannot wait to partner up with you for its creation! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>We know that not all of you can currently spare the money to help fund this album. But that does not mean that you cannot take a part in the partnership of its creation. Spreading the word to as many people as possible can be just as powerful as helping fund it.</p>
<p>So please SHARE, SHARE, SHARE!!! You can share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, by word of mouth, letting websites and other news outlets know about it, or by simply screaming from the top of the nearest mountain. </p>
<p>Every single time you let someone know about this it can help bring us that much closer to accomplishing our goals.</p>
<h3>THE BUDGET</h3>

Brandon is also a full-time Graphic Artist, so these rates are also heavily discounted. The three of us live in different parts of the country (Nick is in Detroit, Phil is in New Orleans, and Brandon is in Portland) so there are some unavoidable travel expenses as well. </p>

<h3>Just another radio station? Definitely NOT!</h3>
<p>Local radio in the UK has changed over the past 10 years.  After a series of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers it seems the idea of a local radio station all the family can enjoy are gone - and that's why we are here!</p>
<p>Broadcasting 24 hours a day and available on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop - and with a very familiar name - Chiltern Radio is set to return on Monday 11 March 2019 as a truly localised station for the three counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire &amp; Hertfordshire.  We are a not-for-profit social enterprise, with every penny re-invested in the service - but we need your help to get the project up and running!</p>
<p>Our exciting station will target the 40+ audience, harnessing the latest technologies to deliver a vibrant localised radio station with a mix of music, news, sport, weather, travel, community information - everything that Chiltern Radio offered but now re-invented for 2019.</p>
<p>You can listen to our test transmissions on the myTuner website - just click <a href=""https://mytuner-radio.com/radio/chiltern-radio-459758/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We Can Offer:</h3>
<p>We need to raise £6,500 to launch the station.  Much of the preparatory work has already been done. We have trademarked the name, test transmissions are underway via our <a href=""http://www.chilternradio.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, the studio is built and some presenters have been found.  If we can't raise all of the money in this crowd funding bid, we plan to run again minus whatever we have raised.  Provided the vital licence fees can be covered we are guaranteed to launch on time even if it has to be a limited service.</p>
<p>The funding we seek will allow us to operate for two years, by which time we will have won an audience and be able to sell advertising to fund our future plans to broadcast as a DAB station. </p>
<p>In return for your support we have put together some reward packages which we think will be of interest and ensure that Chiltern Radio really rocks!  Part of our reward scheme includes advertising on our website as banner ads, programme feature sponsorship and conventional radio advertisements - so for the first year in order to honour these commitments we will not actively try to sell more.</p>
<p>We have produced a multi-page document which details the entire ILR project in some detail, if you want to read it you'll be able to download a *.pdf version <a href=""http://www.chilternradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/ILR-1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>

Local radio in the UK has changed over the past 10 years.  After a series of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers it seems the idea of a local radio station all the family can enjoy are gone - and that's why we are here!
Broadcasting 24 hours a day and available on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop - and with a very familiar name - Chiltern Radio is set to return on Monday 11 March 2019 as a truly localised station for the three counties of Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire & Hertfordshire.  We are a not-for-profit social enterprise, with every penny re-invested in the service - but we need your help to get the project up and running!
Our exciting station will target the 40+ audience, harnessing the latest technologies to deliver a vibrant localised radio station with a mix of music, news, sport, weather, travel, community information - everything that Chiltern Radio offered but now re-invented for 2019.
You can listen to our test transmissions on the myTuner website - just click here.
 
What We Need & What We Can Offer:
We need to raise £6,500 to launch the station.  Much of the preparatory work has already been done. We have trademarked the name, test transmissions are underway via our website, the studio is built and some presenters have been found.  If we can't raise all of the money in this crowd funding bid, we plan to run again minus whatever we have raised.  Provided the vital licence fees can be covered we are guaranteed to launch on time even if it has to be a limited service.
The funding we seek will allow us to operate for two years, by which time we will have won an audience and be able to sell advertising to fund our future plans to broadcast as a DAB station. 
In return for your support we have put together some reward packages which we think will be of interest and ensure that Chiltern Radio really rocks!  Part of our reward scheme includes advertising on our website as banner ads, programme feature sponsorship and conventional radio advertisements - so for the first year in order to honour these commitments we will not actively try to sell more.
We have produced a multi-page document which details the entire ILR project in some detail, if you want to read it you'll be able to download a *.pdf version here.

<h3>UNCOVERED</h3>
<p>Over the course of time there have been many overlooked artists in classical music, especially because of their race or gender. It is important to acknowledge that we have not yet heard the whole story due to this sidelining of musical voices. Composers like Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Florence B. Price, and Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson have contributed beautifully crafted work to the repertoire but are not widely celebrated because quality recordings and performances of their music are rare or non existent. With this recording project we are helping to change this unfortunate reality.</p>

<p>Clarinetist Anthony McGill is one of classical music’s most recognizable and brilliantly multifaceted figures. He serves as the principal clarinet of the New York Philharmonic — that orchestra’s first African-American principal player — and maintains a dynamic international solo and chamber music career. Hailed for his “trademark brilliance, penetrating sound and rich character” (The New York Times), as well as for his “exquisite combination of technical refinement and expressive radiance” (The Baltimore Sun), McGill also serves as an ardent advocate for helping music education reach underserved communities and for addressing issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion in classical music. McGill was honored to take part in the inauguration of President Barack Obama, premiering a piece written for the occasion by John Williams and performing alongside violinist Itzhak Perlman, cellist Yo-Yo Ma, and pianist Gabriela Montero.</p>
<p>McGill’s 2018-19 season includes performances of concertos by Bolcom, Copland, Mozart, and Strauss with the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Tallahassee Symphony, Vermont Symphony, and Austin Symphonic Band. He will also collaborate together with soprano Miah Persson in a performance of Schubert’s “The Shepherd on the Rock” together with Iván Fischer and the New York Philharmonic. Additional performances include a collaboration with the Dover Quartet for the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society and a recital with soprano Julia Bullock for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, along with collaborations with the Brentano Quartet for Princeton University and a tour of Asia with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.</p>
<p>McGill appears regularly as a soloist with top orchestras around North America including the New York Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera, Baltimore Symphony, San Diego Symphony, and Kansas City Symphony. As a chamber musician, McGill is a favorite collaborator of the Brentano, Daedalus, Guarneri, JACK, Miró, Pacifica, Shanghai, Takacs, and Tokyo Quartets, as well as Emanuel Ax, Inon Barnatan, Gloria Chien, Yefim Bronfman, Gil Shaham, Midori, Mitsuko Uchida, and Lang Lang. He has led tours with Musicians from Marlboro and regularly performs for the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Philadelphia Chamber Music Society. Festival appearances include Tanglewood, Marlboro, Mainly Mozart, Music@Menlo, and the Santa Fe, Seattle, and Skaneateles Chamber Music Festivals.</p>
<p>In January 2015, McGill recorded the Nielsen Clarinet Concerto together with Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic, which was released on DaCapo Records. He also recorded an album together with his brother Demarre McGill, principal flute of the Seattle Symphony, and pianist Michael McHale; and one featuring the Mozart and Brahms Clarinet Quintet with the Pacifica Quartet that were both released by Cedille Records.</p>
<p>A dedicated champion of new music, in 2014, McGill premiered a new piece written for him by Richard Danielpour entitled “From the Mountaintop” that was commissioned by the New Jersey Symphony, Kansas City Symphony, and Orchestra 2001. McGill served as the 2015-16 Artist-in-Residence for WQXR and has appeared on Performance Today, MPR’s St. Paul Sunday Morning, and Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood. In 2013, McGill appeared on the NBC Nightly News and on MSNBC, in stories highlighting the McGill brothers’ inspirational story.</p>
<p>A graduate of the Curtis Institute of Music, McGill previously served as the principal clarinet of the Metropolitan Opera and associate principal clarinet of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>When people ask why I recorded this album, my response has always been for love of music. In a world where you can stream music for free, my hope is to prove that people still support the art of music. The honest truth is recording music cost money. This record is a glimpse into ""My Little Life."" </p>
<p>This past July, I headed to Georgia to recorded a 10 song LP called ""My Little Life."" The debut solo album was produced by myself and The Nashes. It was engineered and mixed by Jon Ashley (Engineered 2018 Grammy-Winning Rock Album-War On Drugs).  The Nashes happen to be my brother in law Kalen Nash (Ponderosa/New West Records) and my sister Aslyn (Capitol Records). All three of these individuals poured a lot of heart and musicianship into my record and I'm happy for the world to finally here it.  </p>
<p>The record consist of the following songs: Let Me Be, Hey Little Sunshine, Beautiful, Richer, It's You, Hold On, Ever So Holy, Let It Ride, Call Out To You, &amp; My Little Life.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The record ended up costing $17,500. That included studio time, engineer, producer, musicians, mixing, mastering, artwork, and CD duplication. </p>
<p>There are different levels on ways you can help from ordering a digital download of the record  before it's officially released to paying off the record. If someone pays off the record, all sales from the record in 2019 will be donated to Hurricane Michael victims. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes in life, you know you are suppose to do something. This is one of those projects where I felt God saying ""trust me with this.""  The idea of this project is that no matter who you are, what your age, everyone can have an impact on others. </p>
<p>As many of you know, my heart has always gone out to the victims of Hurricane Michael. When we set up the relief station in Lynn Haven two days after the storm, I knew that we needed live music &amp; music playing. A couple days later, I showed up with our Rock On The Road mobile stage and sound system. I saw firsthand how nerves were calmed with music. I've decided that for every person that purchases my album, I will give away a copy to a victim of Hurricane Michael. There are few things in the works on how to distribute the album to hurricane victims. When it happens, I'll let you all know.  </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I know for some people, they may can't help financially. I totally get it. One way you can help is by sharing the link on social media and spreading the word about ""My Little Life."" God bless all of you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests serves as a platform for the promotion and dissemination of the arts created by indigenous and rural peoples of Costa Rica. Its purpose is to revitalize and raise awareness about caring for the country’s tropical forests, which are threatened by large extensions of monoculture crops, such as pineapple and sugar cane among others. At the same time, the orchestra seeks to promote the cultures of those peoples and communities that have preserved these territories for centuries. We will realize all this through music. Our orchestra is an integrated model that combines arts, manual work, and education in the rural context of agroecology and food sovereignty; in pursuit of a harmonic and sonorous impact for each person who has been involved and touched by this musical project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who &amp; Where We Are</h3>
<p>The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests is a project of Casa Madremonte, an independent cultural center, created by the multidisciplinary Costa Rican artist Guadalupe Urbina, a place where arts, el Buen Vivir, and spirituality go hand in hand with the forest. (<a href=""https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte</a>)</p>
<p>We are people who are concerned about the destruction of the tropical ecosystems in Costa Rica’s southern region and with the loss of the local knowledges still alive in these ecosystems. We want to care for, learn from, and spread our green sanctuary to secure its long life. And long life – Longo Maï – is the name of the village where we want to make sound and sing to the tropical forests of Costa Rica, in order to share with you its music, its medicine, and its beauty.</p>
<p>Longo Maï is a small agricultural village with a culturally diverse population. Here live indigenous people, Central American refugees, Costa Ricans displaced by poverty and after forty years we have become to be a community with great culinary wealth, with knowledges of traditional medicine, and music.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>With the Orchestra of the Tropical Forests we promote the social and ecological integration and transformation in our village and the southern region. The orchestra offers the opportunity for all who are interested in making and learning the music that promotes its cultures; to build, invent, and sell instruments and in that way promote our village, the work of our people and the communal life: el Buen Vivir.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We Can Offer You</h3>
<p>The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests is just being born. It will be inaugurated during the Festival Madremonte Longo Maï (February 15, 16, 17 2019) (<a href=""https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte/festival-madremonte-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte/fe...</a>).</p>
<p>To fully realize our dream, we need working spaces where we can practice, host workshops, and build, exhibit, and sell our handmade instruments. We are in the process of planning a gallery, storage room for instruments, and classroom – solid structures made from affordable local materials from the region.

Short Summary
The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests serves as a platform for the promotion and dissemination of the arts created by indigenous and rural peoples of Costa Rica. Its purpose is to revitalize and raise awareness about caring for the country’s tropical forests, which are threatened by large extensions of monoculture crops, such as pineapple and sugar cane among others. At the same time, the orchestra seeks to promote the cultures of those peoples and communities that have preserved these territories for centuries. We will realize all this through music. Our orchestra is an integrated model that combines arts, manual work, and education in the rural context of agroecology and food sovereignty; in pursuit of a harmonic and sonorous impact for each person who has been involved and touched by this musical project.

Who & Where We Are
The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests is a project of Casa Madremonte, an independent cultural center, created by the multidisciplinary Costa Rican artist Guadalupe Urbina, a place where arts, el Buen Vivir, and spirituality go hand in hand with the forest. (https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte)
We are people who are concerned about the destruction of the tropical ecosystems in Costa Rica’s southern region and with the loss of the local knowledges still alive in these ecosystems. We want to care for, learn from, and spread our green sanctuary to secure its long life. And long life – Longo Maï – is the name of the village where we want to make sound and sing to the tropical forests of Costa Rica, in order to share with you its music, its medicine, and its beauty.
Longo Maï is a small agricultural village with a culturally diverse population. Here live indigenous people, Central American refugees, Costa Ricans displaced by poverty and after forty years we have become to be a community with great culinary wealth, with knowledges of traditional medicine, and music.
Impact
With the Orchestra of the Tropical Forests we promote the social and ecological integration and transformation in our village and the southern region. The orchestra offers the opportunity for all who are interested in making and learning the music that promotes its cultures; to build, invent, and sell instruments and in that way promote our village, the work of our people and the communal life: el Buen Vivir.
What We Need & What We Can Offer You
The Orchestra of the Tropical Forests is just being born. It will be inaugurated during the Festival Madremonte Longo Maï (February 15, 16, 17 2019) (https://urbinaart.wixsite.com/casamadremonte/fe...).
To fully realize our dream, we need working spaces where we can practice, host workshops, and build, exhibit, and sell our handmade instruments. We are in the process of planning a gallery, storage room for instruments, and classroom – solid structures made from affordable local materials from the region. The designers are ready, we have multiple partnering agencies, and a corps of volunteers.
We need your help raising $4,000 to build the structures and pay the person in charge of the direction of the construction.
We are very grateful for any contribution. We also offer some perks (optional) to demonstrate our gratitude.       For donations in the amount of:
50$ … we’ll paint your name on one of the new building’s walls.100$ … we’ll paint your name and give you 2 songs of Guadalupe’s disc ‘Cantos Simples del Amor de la Tierra’.200$ … we’ll paint your name and give you 4 songs of Guadalupe’s Disc.500$ … we’ll paint your name and give you the full Disc.1000$ … we’ll paint your name, give you the full disc, and offer you a guided tour in our village, the primary forest in our community, a visit to our ancestor’s petroglyphs, ending up with a swim in the river to later get to know Casa Madremonte and its edible and medicinal garden, and of course the Music Center for the Tropical Forests; if you decide to come to visit us.
Please send us an email to cadisur2012@gmail.com if you donated and are interested in the corresponding gifts.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute financially, that does not mean you cannot help us! Please, spread the word, our video, and make some noise about our Orchestra! We are deeply thankful for your time and support to help us reach our goal.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>James ""JP"" Connell and Reid Spencer are former members of the band Milkweed, which gained prominence in the Southeast in the early 1970s, sharing stages with the Allman Brothers, Jimmy Buffett, Jerry Jeff Walker, Al Kooper, Wet Willie, Randall Bramblett and Wet Willie. </p>
<p>By a remarkable coincidence detailed on the website <a href=""http://www.jamesreidband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jamesreidband.com</a>, the two songwriters reunited after 40 years and recorded the CD ""Breakfast at Sunset"" (released in 2016). That album featured an eclectic blend of new songs and compositions from the Milkweed days.</p>
<p>The band's new CD, ""Tales Tall and Tender,"" will incorporate that same concept, and it is for this project that we ask for your support. Our campaign seeks funding for recording studio sessions at Bredouw's Barn, a state-of-the-art recording studio on Orcas Island in Washington state, as well as travel expenses and compensation for the world-class musicians who make up the James Reid Band.</p>
<p>Your support will allow us to record and distribute the music we create. Any proceeds from the sale of CDs over and above the costs will be donated to charitable causes. In fact, the first scheduled record sessions for the new CD follow two benefit concerts on April 1 and 2 in support of Recovery in Community, a network of trained volunteer advocates supporting the recovery of Orcas Island residents suffering from mental illness or substance abuse disorders.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Our total need for the recording project is $8,000, which will cover studio time and travel and compensation for the band members, who are traveling from Connecticut, Kentucky, North Carolina and Seattle to create ""Tales Tall and Tender."" Included in the $8,000 are graphic design for the CD jacket and liner as well as the physical production of the CDs.</p>
<p>If you contribute $10, you'll receive a free download of the CD as soon as it becomes available. For $25, you'll get a copy of the CD, signed by JP and Reid. Contributors of $100 receive signed copies of both the ""Tales Tall and Tender"" and ""Breakfast at Sunset"" CDs. For $250, you'll get a special thanks, with your name printed in the liner notes of the CD, in addition to the other perks listed above.</p>
<p>And if you really want to be an ""angel"" and contributed $4,000, JP and Reid will play their songs for you at a private party. But more than anything, you'll get the satisfaction of helping two creative songwriters establish their legacy in music.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, you can still help us by getting the word out through social media and the Indiegogo share tools. Just know that, whatever you're able to do, we sincerely appreciate it.</p>

<p>The First Hello. </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Kerri Lyn Angel. I have been a songwriter,  poet and artist all my life. Over the course of that time I have written hundreds of lyrics and melodies but,  for the most part,  I have never released any of this to the public.</p>
<p>With your help,  I would like to change this.</p>
<p>I grew up on the eastern end of Long Island, N. Y. .I was born in 1958, the first of 5 children,  3 boys, 2 girls. I had a somewhat idyllic childhood in white bread middle class America. I was known as a daydreamer, dawdle and dilly dallier. In spite of that I was still, for the most part,  an ""A"" student. I spent a lot of time reading and writing poetry and songs.  I was extremely creative and also did a lot of artwork and handcrafts. That's what lead me to my Aunt who I  learned my profession from,  floral design which I excelled at.  I continued writing and held my dream of being the ""songwriter "" for some fancy recording artist. </p>
<p>My life took me to L. A. in 1978 where I excelled so much at my profession that I eventually became co owner of a  beautiful florist in Beverly Hills. My wonderful success was short lived though, due to bad behavior and poor choices.</p>
<p>I made my way back to Long Island in 1986 and started over again. My new life included 2 children,  a boy and a girl. </p>
<p>In 2005 I was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. After undergoing 20 hour brain surgery, I was left disabled. I no longer had my balance or hearing on the left but all of my  cranial nerves were damaged,  leading to chronic facial and eye pain. I have had, and continue to have any procedure possible to help. I have had to learn to deal with terrible random noises in my head in order to do music again. I thought those days were over so I concentrated on my artwork.  I even exhibited a few times after I moved to Pa. </p>
<p>In 2006, I was gradually learning to cope with my disabilities. Then on March 15, 2014, along came Max (Mathew Malanowicz) oh boy, our eyes locked and it was pure magic. It was joy. It was love. I was so thrilled to collaborate with Max. He had music and no words. I had so very many words and no music. He was willing to work and work we did. We worked very hard and took it very seriously because we had a plan. We were not just soulmates and lovers but creators of timeless,  simple songs that could stand alone or be built upon.  We even played out a few times even though ultimately we did not really want to be the ""performers "".Oh yes, I loved Max like no other. Unfortunately,  he suffered from mental illness and even though he was getting better, suddenly suffered a series of personal tragedies which resulted in his suicide on January 10th 2015. I was devastated to the point of nervous breakdown.  The hundreds of practice recordings were all that was left. So my inspiration for this  body of work and  probably the next 2 are not only to live my life long dream but to also leave Max a legacy of these songs we worked so very hard on. </p>
<p>Max believed in our music and so do I.</p>
<p>I need your help with this incredible stepping stone.</p>
<p>With a very limited fixed income, and many personal daily struggles on my part, much love and help is needed for me to pull this off successfully. I am only asking for a very modest sum, in order for me to complete this heartfelt project. </p>
<p>Your generous contribution will make a great impact.</p>
<p>In return for your generosity, know that your contribution will change this poet's life forever. </p>

<p>Although she loves her hometown, she’s always been ready to take on an adventure. She’s never been afraid of taking the road less traveled. Has spent many nights after playing shows sleeping in her car or  has found a spot to curl up on a friend or twos couch along the way. If asked, she takes full responsibility for her parents hair turning grey. She has a gypsy soul and a little bit of a rebel side at times but you can’t deny that she has a way of lighting up the room with her smile and personality. She is the meaning of “never met a stranger”.  She has a kind heart but she’s also not afraid to let you know where she stands and what she believes in. She’s exactly the kind of true grit country music needs today.</p>

Located 2 hours from Pittsburgh, Washington DC, Baltimore, and Harrisburg, Frostburg is a small college town that welcomes Festival guests from as faraway as Connecticut, Chicago, Denver, and even San Francisco, and bands from around the country. We strive to keep the costs low, and we sell no Festival merchandise beyond ""best of"" records, allow the bands to sell merch for free, and provide a venue for bands to reach a new audience, and the audience to discover new bands or see bands they otherwise would never be able to see. The Savage Mountain Punk Fest is an economic boost to a region that needs it, and this year we want to increase the visibility of the festival by bringing Richie Ramone of the Ramones and legendary pop punk pioneers the Queers to Frostburg.</h3><h3> </h3><h3>Over the three years of Savage Mountain Punk Festival, we've seen bigger names take the stage, and bigger crowds in the club. And each year, we get more ambitious.</h3><h3>
<br/>We need your help. We recognize not everyone's into punk, and we realize not every punk can come out; we see this as a DYI festival in a world of Warped tours that brings people to a region that needs something to celebrate. ANd to thank you, we offer a variety of perks, from tickets to digital downloads to vinyl records. We want to thank all of you who helps us, and hope you'll make this the best Savage Mountain Festival yet.</h3></div>","Get Savage! Started in 2016, the Savage Mountain Punk Fest is an old school music festival celebrating bringing national and regional punk bands to economically distressed Appalachia. Located 2 hours from Pittsburgh, Washington DC, Baltimore, and Harrisburg, Frostburg is a small college town that welcomes Festival guests from as faraway as Connecticut, Chicago, Denver, and even San Francisco, and bands from around the country. We strive to keep the costs low, and we sell no Festival merchandise beyond ""best of"" records, allow the bands to sell merch for free, and provide a venue for bands to reach a new audience, and the audience to discover new bands or see bands they otherwise would never be able to see. The Savage Mountain Punk Fest is an economic boost to a region that needs it, and this year we want to increase the visibility of the festival by bringing Richie Ramone of the Ramones and legendary pop punk pioneers the Queers to Frostburg. Over the three years of Savage Mountain Punk Festival, we've seen bigger names take the stage, and bigger crowds in the club. And each year, we get more ambitious.
We need your help. We recognize not everyone's into punk, and we realize not every punk can come out; we see this as a DYI festival in a world of Warped tours that brings people to a region that needs something to celebrate.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We met at Bethel University located in McKenzie, TN at a songwriting competition where one of us (cough cough Adam) won. That day we decided to start a band together. We played a couple of coffee houses on campus, but with our demanding music programs we were unable to really dive into starting a band. We did, however, succeed in falling in love. We got married in 2014 and were finally able to start our career as a duo. We decided on Cherry Avenue because that's the street where it all began.</p>
<p>One of our dreams is to have a complete, high quality, radio ready album. The songs we will be recording are our best yet! Our new material and another high quality video are exactly what we need to take our music career to the next level.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will be a part of what we are doing here in Nashville. We have a message that we believe people need to hear. This album will show many sides of us, from vulnerability and passion, to some light heartedness and a little (or a lot) of sass.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first $1500 will go to the creation of our next music video for our song Off Road. This song greatly contrasts our first music video ""I Miss Home"" and is exactly what we need to show a different side of us and help us push our brand. The money will go to production, editing, filming, venues and everything else it takes to create a high quality music video from Copper Saw Films. The remainder of the funds will go toward completing our album with a goal of 5 more songs in addition to the 7 we have. This will go to the production, studio time, engineering, A-list musicians and everything else that goes into making a high quality, radio ready album.  The production will be done by Chris Goff of GoffHouse Music featuring the best players in Nashville who have played on albums such as Brooks &amp; Dunn, Alan Jackson, Carrie Underwood, Tim McGraw, Sugarland, Martina McBride and MANY more.</p>
<p>Every contributor, no matter how big or small will be able to request a cover or original song for us to perform on our Youtube and Facebook with a personal shout out in the video. As we move up through the amounts you can receive a signed original EP, an original Cherry Avenue T Shirt, signed copy of our Album (This will take time to complete and order), and even a personal concert in your home! </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will record as many tracks as we can and reach out to our previous sponsors. Anything above and beyond our goal will be used to record more songs for our album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe these tracks will really influence people across the world. ""Don't Worry 'Bout Me"" is based on one of Erika's high school friends that passed away too young. This song describes what she believes Maci would want us to hear. It is great for anyone coping with loss. ""Wide Eyed And Pretty"" is a sassy song about those who underestimate women and our take on it. ""Better For Me"" is a women's anthem. You know those guys who think they're hot stuff and better than everyone else. Well... this one is for you. ""Takin' Me Back"" is about a summer love that ended too soon. Every little thing reminds you of that person and you can't forget the memories as hard as you try. ""Honky Tonk Home"" is a fun loving song about a couple that just wants to kick back, throw on some classic country records and dance the night away.</p>
<p>Our Debut EP has been very successful so far. We have thousands of streams on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. It has been played on radio stations across the nation. Our EP helped us break through as artists. Our first music video has over 80k views and is climbing. We will be using the same people to produce both, so the quality will be just as good, if not better. </p>
<p>Our vision is to create positive country music with a faith based message. We are striving to produce songs that aren't just about cussing, drinking, and going out all the time. Our end goal is to be on a large platform where we can set a good example for others, share our love for the world and most of all our love for God. We can't wait to get this music out to the world, thank you so much for being a part of our dream! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We don't think we will run into any issues as we have worked with these individuals and companies before. Sometimes time can be an issue, but we plan to release singles along the way. Another challenge would be not receiving enough money. In this case we will have to cut less tracks and have a smaller album, or just release singles until we can raise more money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, we totally understand! Remember a couple of things. Every dollar counts, so don't think your contribution is too small. There are many other ways to help. Share our story and campaign on your media pages, with your rich uncle down in Florida, talk about it with your friends, family and even your co-workers. Another way to help is to send us some encouragement. It takes a lot of vulnerability to ask for money and put our music out there for others to hear. Every bit of encouragement keeps us moving forward!</p>

<p>Shortly after the release of the debut ""As It Should Be"", A BEAUTIFUL CURSE embarked on writing and recording the second collection of songs that became ""A Scar Is Born"".  The momentum and excitement was enormous with the creation of live performances, more videos, etc. but in the excitement, only digital copies of the album came out.</p>
<p>Now that things have calmed down from the ""...Scar..."" era, we looked back and realized that we never released any vinyl or cd's or anything from it.  What the...?  So here we are, ready, willing, and able to make hard copy versions of the celebrated second album a reality but only with your help.</p>
<p>So the full disclosure is this, if hard copies are going to be made we wanted to go all out.  SO, for ""...Scar..."" we're doing a number of things just for you to enjoy (and truthfully for us to experiment with):</p>
<p>1. Re-mastering the original stereo mixes, 2. creating 3D stereo mixes of the album (3D stereo is intended for headphone use and it's like surround sound in a stereo field), 3. 5.1 surround sound mixes on both DVD (in case anyone still has a dvd player) and on blu-ray, both of which will have hi-res audio listening options for you.  On top of all of that, we were asked to create a ""making of""-type documentary explaining the history and the formation of A BEAUTIFUL CURSE so we're putting that on the DVD and Blu-Ray as a requested bonus for you.</p>
<p>It's been said before but here it is again: there's nothing like having a tangible item in your hands compared to just ""another collection of files sitting around on your computer"", ya know?  It's an actual ""thing"" in your hands and in this case, the ""thing"" is a collection of songs and videos from ABC.</p>
<p>So we're asking for your help in order to create this tangible art piece.  And you digital fans are part of this as well.  Each copy of the vinyl comes with a download code so you can have the songs (and videos and what-not) on the device of your choosing.  And believe me, there's a lot of stuff for you all.</p>
<p>Check out the multiple perks packages that we're putting together for you to choose from (from the full on collection to simply a copy of the cd if that's all that you're needing.  </p>
<p>If you’re curious about what the project sounds like feel free to look for A Beautiful Curse on any of your streaming/download platforms you like, but ultimately, please contribute to this campaign to make this hard copy release a reality (which ends on September 13th (yup, a Friday)). </p>
<p>Thank you SO much for checking this out and helping out.  Please spread the word about this Indiegogo campaign in any way you can.  It will be glorious (wink).  </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Financiamiento.</h3>
<p>Para realizar un disco profesional, hemos cotizado y conseguido poder realizar el proyecto anterior con 7000 USD. </p>
<p>Lo siguiente es para dar una noción de lo que toma la realización y producción de un CD y los costos:</p>
<p>1. PRE-PRODUCCIÓN: Esto incluye la selección de temas a grabar, cotizaciones, contratación de músicos, estudios de grabación, productores, partituras, ensayos y en general los arreglos y coordinación de todos los elementos para que la grabación pueda ocurrir sin contratiempos y de forma fluida. </p>
<p>2. GRABACIÓN: En promedio un estudio de grabación cobra por tema musical entre 800 y 4,000 USD. Esto es grabar cada instrumento y voces, es decir, captar el sonido en una cinta magnética o un dispositivo digital.</p>
<p>3. MEZCLA y MASTERIZACIÓN: Las tomas grabadas para cada canción o tema musical, se someten a un proceso llamado mezcla y masterización. La mezcla incluye cualquier efecto especial o ajuste de volumen para que todas las tomas grabadas tomen su lugar en la canción. Una vez mezclado el material la masterización le da el ""matiz"" y el ""brillo"" al tema en sí. Normalmente la mezcla y masterización se hacen por separado y a veces lleva mas tiempo que la grabación. Es todo un proceso de edición complejo y detallado. Algunos estudios de grabación ya incluyen este servicio como parte de la grabación.</p>
<p>3. DISEÑO: Se busca un especialista que diseñe arte para la caja del CD, el disco, etc y se asegura de que exista una congruencia entre el sonido y el arte visual del CD. </p>
<p>4. MAQUILA y DISTRIBUCIÓN: Una vez que se tiene el diseño seleccionado y los temas musicales mezclados y masterizados, estos se mandan a una maquiladora para que fabriquen los CDs. Una vez entregados se hacen los arreglos de mensajería y paquetería necesarios para el envío y distribución del CD. El costo unitario de un CD puede oscilar entre 1 a 5 (o mas) USD.</p>
<p><u><strong>¡Proyecto Terminado: Marzo 2017!</strong></u></p>

Además, en este CD quisiera incluir y compartir unos temas que me parecen algo verdaderamente bello (sus primeras composiciones clásicas a la guitarra totalmente inéditas) que descubrí cuando estaba poniendo sus papeles y partituras musicales en orden después de fallecido. Créanme: son una belleza. Estos temas hay que grabarlos.
Asimismo, logré rescatar el controversial y último tema musical de su autoría, tema que estrenó e interpretó en vivo el mismísimo día que se fue. El titulo de la obra: ""Tengo que partir"".
 

Estoy muy contento de poder compartir este proyecto con ustedes y hacerlos parte del mismo. 
 
¡LA META ES DARLE DE REGALO DE NAVIDAD A PONCHIN SU NUEVO DISCO!
¡Estamos seguros que familiares y amigos juntos podemos lograrlo!

Financiamiento.
Para realizar un disco profesional, hemos cotizado y conseguido poder realizar el proyecto anterior con 7000 USD. 
Lo siguiente es para dar una noción de lo que toma la realización y producción de un CD y los costos:
1. PRE-PRODUCCIÓN: Esto incluye la selección de temas a grabar, cotizaciones, contratación de músicos, estudios de grabación, productores, partituras, ensayos y en general los arreglos y coordinación de todos los elementos para que la grabación pueda ocurrir sin contratiempos y de forma fluida. 
2. GRABACIÓN: En promedio un estudio de grabación cobra por tema musical entre 800 y 4,000 USD. Esto es grabar cada instrumento y voces, es decir, captar el sonido en una cinta magnética o un dispositivo digital.
3. MEZCLA y MASTERIZACIÓN: Las tomas grabadas para cada canción o tema musical, se someten a un proceso llamado mezcla y masterización. La mezcla incluye cualquier efecto especial o ajuste de volumen para que todas las tomas grabadas tomen su lugar en la canción. Una vez mezclado el material la masterización le da el ""matiz"" y el ""brillo"" al tema en sí. Normalmente la mezcla y masterización se hacen por separado y a veces lleva mas tiempo que la grabación. Es todo un proceso de edición complejo y detallado. Algunos estudios de grabación ya incluyen este servicio como parte de la grabación.
3. DISEÑO: Se busca un especialista que diseñe arte para la caja del CD, el disco, etc y se asegura de que exista una congruencia entre el sonido y el arte visual del CD. 
4. MAQUILA y DISTRIBUCIÓN: Una vez que se tiene el diseño seleccionado y los temas musicales mezclados y masterizados, estos se mandan a una maquiladora para que fabriquen los CDs. Una vez entregados se hacen los arreglos de mensajería y paquetería necesarios para el envío y distribución del CD. El costo unitario de un CD puede oscilar entre 1 a 5 (o mas) USD.
¡Proyecto Terminado: Marzo 2017!

<p>Over a decade and a half ago, I was laying on a shag carpet in an apartment in Toledo, OH.  I was there for my summer internship with General Motors and although I appeared chill, I was bottling-up chaos.  I knew that the Stanford engineering path I was on was not the road I needed to travel and it soon hit me that pursuing my passion was my only valid option to impact the world.  I was going to rap and inner peace resulted...</p>
<p>Now, I won't say all was easy after that. I still had to convince my parents it was a good idea to toss away guaranteed engineering money in favor of a makeshift living. I had to work through a steep artistic learning curve while simultaneously dealing with skeptics, naysayers, and critics.  But still nothing was more soul hollowing than the relationships I lost through the petty misunderstandings and frailties that accompany the game...</p>

<p>But the game also brings joy when your musical creation <i>finally </i>reaches your vision.  I smirked when I realized that I had not only become a dope rapper, but also a seasoned songwriter, orchestrator, and storyteller.  Plus, I’ve been allowed to tour (domestic &amp; abroad), open for major artists, throw my own shows, and create several albums worth of stellar music. I’ve mentored youth, created platforms for other artists to flourish, and gave back to the communities that nurtured me.  </p>
<p>But the greatest part of this journey has been the countless number of positive relationships I've formed. My best memories are of collaborating and sharing with other people.  You see, I create for folks like me:  those who understand and exercise the power to better themselves and their world.  And in all my future musical endeavors, I want to bring forth more and more ways to have these worlds collide...</p>

<p>So to further explain, I had a fictional conversation with myself.  Although there was some friction at first, when all was over, not only was ole boy on #TeamLetsRide, but he also was the first to contribute. For your clarity, the conversation is in its entirety below:</p>
<p><b>What’s Good Bruh? </b></p>
<p>Nothing much, man. Glad the project piqued your interest.</p>
<p><b>Nah.  Just Bored, But I Did Read Your “Purpose” Above and That Was Real Cute.</b></p>
<p>Uhhhh...thanks man. You know I wa---</p>
<p><b>Yeah Whateva Mane. So What Exactly Does This “I Am Not Them” Mean?</b> </p>
<p>Well, the “I” is clarified by establishing who the “THEM” are. THEM = Those who are Anti-Growth, Giving, and Greatness. You know, nothing like you and I, right man?</p>
<p><b>Chill...So What's this Legacy Project Exactly? An Album in an App, Right? </b></p>
<p>Mmmm...kinda, but not really.  It's a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> 1st of its kind, interactive ""app based album"" that engages, highlights, and connects the FAM (or users) through storytelling. </span></p>
<p><b>Bruh...In Human Terms. Explain That To Me Again. </b></p>
<p>My bad, man. I get excited. Basically, it consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Music</b> Still the heart and soul of it all.</li>
<li>
<b>The ""Music Video"" Episodes</b> Visuals will be uniquely suited to the song, but will be connected telling a larger story. </li>
<li>
<b>The ""Engagement"" Episodes</b> Social media shenanigans, call-to-actions, ""art imitating life experiments"", hashtag walls, and other items that share and connect.</li>
<li>
<b>The ""FAM"" Features</b>  Highlighting both the creators and selected users of the project.</li>
<li>
<b>The Duration</b> About 2 months. Albums are so short lived nowadays. Here’s a cool-like way to lengthen the experience. </li>
<li>
<b>The App</b> Insuring that all is an engaging and seamless ride. </li>
<li>
<b>The Music Distribution </b> Although all is meant to be experienced through the app, we are still having the album in digital form and CD hard copy.  Vinyl may be considered later...</li>
<li>
<b>The FAM Or...YOU</b> There's an overarching story that needs you.  It's gonna be an incredible project as is, but with your input it will end up being something legendary.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>That Sounds Kinda Dope Actually, But Why Are<i> You</i> the One Making It? </b></p>
<p>A tad condescending, but cool I guess.  See, you’re looking at it wrong. It’s <i>not </i>just me.  Yeah, the core of this project is coming from yours truly, but I have an expert team for all aspects of the project. So perhaps the better question is, who but <i>WE</i> to create this?</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Good call.  Given that this is something special, we’d like to expose it to as large an audience as possible, so a second goal of $12,000 would be utilized to market it.

Yeah Whateva Mane. So What Exactly Does This “I Am Not Them” Mean? 
Well, the “I” is clarified by establishing who the “THEM” are. THEM = Those who are Anti-Growth, Giving, and Greatness. You know, nothing like you and I, right man?
Chill...So What's this Legacy Project Exactly? An Album in an App, Right? 
Mmmm...kinda, but not really.  It's a 1st of its kind, interactive ""app based album"" that engages, highlights, and connects the FAM (or users) through storytelling. 
Bruh...In Human Terms. Explain That To Me Again. 
My bad, man. I get excited. Basically, it consists of:


The Music Still the heart and soul of it all.

The ""Music Video"" Episodes Visuals will be uniquely suited to the song, but will be connected telling a larger story. 

The ""Engagement"" Episodes Social media shenanigans, call-to-actions, ""art imitating life experiments"", hashtag walls, and other items that share and connect.

The ""FAM"" Features  Highlighting both the creators and selected users of the project.

The Duration About 2 months. Albums are so short lived nowadays. Here’s a cool-like way to lengthen the experience. 

The App Insuring that all is an engaging and seamless ride. 

The Music Distribution  Although all is meant to be experienced through the app, we are still having the album in digital form and CD hard copy.  Vinyl may be considered later...

The FAM Or...YOU There's an overarching story that needs you.  It's gonna be an incredible project as is, but with your input it will end up being something legendary.

That Sounds Kinda Dope Actually, But Why Are You the One Making It? 
A tad condescending, but cool I guess.  See, you’re looking at it wrong. It’s not just me.  Yeah, the core of this project is coming from yours truly, but I have an expert team for all aspects of the project. So perhaps the better question is, who but WE to create this?


Ok. I See.  You Feelin Yourself a Bit.  But What About This $$$ Though?  What Dollars Go Where?
Well, I've learned how to create very polished projects for very reasonable amounts. To get the project up and complete we’ll need $25,000.  
So What Happens If You Get Over That Amount?
Good call.  Given that this is something special, we’d like to expose it to as large an audience as possible, so a second goal of $12,000 would be utilized to market it. Lastly, since it would be great to document the entire project and share it with ya’ll, we have another goal of $3,000 to form a 5-part webisode series showing the adventures. (Similar to the one we did HERE). 
So, the minimum goal is $25k, but $40k is Big Boi status?
Cute reference, but yeah.  Matter of fact, I have this real cool-like 8th grade throwback pie chart explaining all:


Man, Ya'll Are Doing Some Incredible Things for Some Real Reasonable Rates.  That's Less Than Jay-Z's Daily ""Keep Up With Beyonce"" Budget and Drake's Ghostwriter Retainer!
Who you telling, man.  Preciate.
Soooo...Are the “Perks” Like My Gift or Something for Helping This Come to Be? 
Exactly. It’s like us letting you know that your contribution isn’t taken lightly so here’s this token of our appreciation. You know, fund the whole thing and I’ll Riverdance for your next birthday, bruh...


Well, Let's Hope I Never Age Then, But Now I’m Intrigued. After the Project is Released and I’ve Enjoyed the Entire Experience, Is That It? Any Follow-Ups? 
Man, I couldn’t have prepped that question better myself. I'm aiming to go on tour as both a solo artist and with the full band, Big Piph & Tomorrow Maybe. Also, we'll hit certain schools and organizations in underserved communities to conduct workshops for students and youth. Very similar to what we do now both foreign and domestic, but just on a larger scale. Plus, there is a sequel in mind...
Bet, But Say...Could You Hold On a Second or Three, Mane?
Yeah, I'm kosher. Do you.
Ok. I'm Back. I Just Had to Go Pledge to the Campaign Real Quick. I'm Thoroughly Impressed and Looking Forward to It.
Well, shoot man. Preciate that.
No Thing.  Plus, You Remind Me of Myself Actually.
I guess that's cool...
Well, I'ma Spread the Word via Social Media and All.  In the Meantime, You and Your Squad Get to Work. You've Gotta Lotta Folks Looking Forward To This.  And Congrats in Advance!
Means a lot man. Preciate again and will get at you later.
Cool.
Cool.



Can't wait to take this journey with ya'll.

<p>La musique est faite pour divertir mais aussi revendiquer, redonner espoir, réconforter et rassembler. La musique a le pouvoir d'influencer et les gens y retrouvent leur histoire et leurs rêves. Certains chanteurs et chanteuses ont marqué des générations entières, d'autres sont aujourd'hui des références. Bob Marley, James Brown, Tracey Chapman, Alpha Blondy, Tiken Dja Facoli et bien d'autres.

<p>Music is made to entertain but also advocate, give hope, comfort and gather people. Music has the power to influence and people can relate to the stories that are told. Some singers have impacted entire generations, others are references today . Bob Marley, James Brown, Tracey Chapman, Alpha Blondy , Tiken Dja Facoli and many others . Like them , I sing to also make a difference, topics everyone can relate to, to give a warm and beautiful portrait of the African culture , to support social causes such as poverty, health and children. Born in Côte d'Ivoire, I started to sing at a young age and Manitoba has been my new home since 2008. I learned a lot and my music has been impacted by this beautiful culture. So, encouraged by the positive response to my first album Africa, I started working on an EP album of 6 songs that will showcase a mix of Folk and World Music. A link to some demos (on soundcloud) is posted on my website and you can follow us on<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Kelly-Bado-Page-musicale-524766010924723/?fref=nf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> facebook</a> (Kelly E.

<p><b>5. Risque et défis / Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>Les projets comme le mien demandent des heures de travail. Le défi si nous n'atteignons pas l'objectif de cette collecte, sera de pouvoir ajuster le tout. Donc réduire le nombre d'instruments et le temps de travail (l'enregistrement studio, le temps de mixage, le mastering et le nombre d'impressions). Nous pensions inclure un instrument traditionnel appelé la kora dans un des morceaux mais pour cela, il nous faut embaucher un musicien de Kora à Montréal car il n'y en pas de disponible à Winnipeg. Il faudra aussi couvrir des frais d'enregistrement d'un studio à Montréal. Si nous n'avons les fond nécessaire, nous devrons trouver des alternatives ou maximiser le travail sur les 2 meilleurs morceaux, même si nous souhaitons que toutes les chansons aient les mêmes chances. Ce projet se veut simple, acoustique ce qui facilitera l'utilisation rationnelle et intelligente des fonds qui seront disponibles. </p>

Pourquoi faire de la musique? / Why am I singing?


La musique est faite pour divertir mais aussi revendiquer, redonner espoir, réconforter et rassembler. La musique a le pouvoir d'influencer et les gens y retrouvent leur histoire et leurs rêves. Certains chanteurs et chanteuses ont marqué des générations entières, d'autres sont aujourd'hui des références. Bob Marley, James Brown, Tracey Chapman, Alpha Blondy, Tiken Dja Facoli et bien d'autres. Tout comme eux, je chante pour faire aussi une différence, sur des thèmes ou tout le monde se retrouve, pour donner un portrait chaleureux et beau de la culture africaine, soutenir des causes sociales tel que la pauvreté, la santé et les enfants. Originaire de Côte d'Ivoire, je chante depuis mon jeune âge et aujourd'hui je vis au Manitoba, ma terre d'accueil. J'ai appris beaucoup et ma musique s'est imprégnée de cette belle culture. Encouragée par la rétroaction positive que mon premier single Africa a reçu, j'ai commencé a préparer un maxi-disque de 6 chansons, qui offrira un mélange de Folk et musique du monde. Un lien vers quelques démos (sur SoundCloud ) est affiché sur mon site et vous pouvez nous suivre sur facebook (Kelly E. Bado) pour voir les progrès.

Music is made to entertain but also advocate, give hope, comfort and gather people. Music has the power to influence and people can relate to the stories that are told. Some singers have impacted entire generations, others are references today . Bob Marley, James Brown, Tracey Chapman, Alpha Blondy , Tiken Dja Facoli and many others . Like them , I sing to also make a difference, topics everyone can relate to, to give a warm and beautiful portrait of the African culture , to support social causes such as poverty, health and children. Born in Côte d'Ivoire, I started to sing at a young age and Manitoba has been my new home since 2008. I learned a lot and my music has been impacted by this beautiful culture. So, encouraged by the positive response to my first album Africa, I started working on an EP album of 6 songs that will showcase a mix of Folk and World Music. A link to some demos (on soundcloud) is posted on my website and you can follow us on facebook (Kelly E. Bado) to see the progress.

2. L'objectif de ma campagne / The goal of my campaign 
Financé en  grande partie par Manitoba Film and Music, le Conseil des arts de Winnipeg, le 100 nons par l'entremise de Francofonds et Radio Envol 91, j'ai  pu enclencher mon projet de maxi-disque. Mes réalisateurs sont Norman Dugas et Daniel Roa. Norman Dugas est vétéran de la scène musicale, y œuvrant depuis ses débuts sur la scène musicale montréalaise et canadienne des années '70 avec, entre autres, Daniel Lavoie. Daniel Roa est un musicien très sollicité et auteur­compositeur établi, ayant à son actif 2 disques appuyés par Musication. 
La musique est un domaine qui demande beaucoup d’investissement
et dont la rentabilité est seulement à long terme. Mon objectif est donc de prélever 5500$ en faisant la pré-vente de mon album et en offrant des bonus alléchants.
Cet argent va soutenir directement le coût des musiciens professionnels, le temps du studio, la conception et l'impression de 500 exemplaires de l'album. Il faut plus qu'un chanteur pour produire un album , nous avons besoin d' une équipe de professionnels qui donneront de leur mieux et, surtout, de leur temps. Un lien vers quelques démos (sur SoundCloud ) est affiché sur mon site et vous pouvez nous suivre sur facebook (Kelly E. Bado) pour voir les progrès.........................     ........................     .........................    .........................    ..........................
Partially funded by Manitoba Film and Music, The Winnipeg Arts Council, le 100 Nons through Francofonds and Radio Envol 91, I was able to start the production of my EP album. My producers are Norman Dugas and Daniel Roa. Norman Dugas is a veteran of the music scene , working in the domain since its debut on the Montreal and Canadian music scene of the 70s with, Daniel Lavoie, among others. Daniel Roa is a well-known musician and singer-songwriter established, with two albums supported by Musication .

Music requires considerable investment and profitability is only in the long term . My goal is to collect $ 5,500 by pre-selling my album and also offering you bonuses. This money will directly support the cost of the professional musicians, the studio time, the design and printing of 500 copies of the album. It takes more than a singer to produce an album, we need a team of professionals who will give their best and most importantly, their time. A link to some demos (on soundcloud) is posted on my website and you can follow us on facebook (Kelly E. Bado) to see the progress.
3. Ce que vous obtenez / What you obtainProcurez-vous mon album d'avance et recevez des bonus tel que des tickets du concert de lancement, une photo profesionnelle dédicacée, une copie des paroles, des t-shirts (combinés avec des tissus africains) de la boutique en ligne, une expérience en studio, des concerts maison, des remerciements personnalisés et bien d'autres! 
En février, un aperçu de chaque morceau sera publié sur mon site web www.kellybado.com

To support this project you can purchase my album in advance and receive some bonuses such as tickets for the release concert, autographed photos, lyrics, t- shirt mixed with african fabrics from my e-boutique, an experience in the studio with us recording, house concerts, a personalized thank you note and many others!
In February 2016, a preview of each song will be posted on my website www.kellybado.com 






4. Mon objectif à court-moyen et long terme / my short-medium and long term goal

J'espère faire jouer mon album dans les radios communautaires, nationales au Canada et internationales grace à un plan marketing solide et une équipe qui commence à se former autour de ma carriere. Mon premier album single Africa joue déjà en onde à Ici Manitoba grâce à une de leur généreuse bourse , à Radio Envol 91 et à la radio en ligne de Manitoba Music.

<h3>Bref résumé</h3>
<p>Depuis maintenant 11 ans, la CLES soutient les femmes qui souhaitent sortir de la prostitution ou qui en sont sorties.</p>
<p>À travers les 600 contacts que nous avons par année avec des survivantes de la prostitution, nous avons pu constater que <b>la pauvreté est un obstacle majeur</b> à la sortie de la prostitution et qu'il n'existe aucun soutien financier direct pour<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> aider les femmes. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>C'est pourquoi nous avons mis sur pied le Fonds de solidarité!</b></p>
<p>Il nous permet de soutenir financièrement les projets des femmes afin de faciliter leur sortie et leur après-sortie. Ce Fonds ne reçoit aucun financement gouvernemental. Il repose entièrement sur vos dons!</p>
<p>En donnant au Fonds de solidarité, <b>vous soutenez concrètement les femmes</b> dans leur sortie de la prostitution. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Aucun argent ne va à l'organisme.  </b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ce dont nous avons besoin...</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Nous souhaitons amasser <b>10 000$ </b>. Ce montant nous permettra de soutenir les projets des femmes en lien avec... </p>

<p></p>
<p>Les Fonds amassés nous permettront de défrayer des frais d'inscription au secondaire, au cégep ou à l'université, de fournir des ordinateurs ou du matériel scolaire ou encore, d'effectuer une demande de pardon judiciaire, le casier criminel étant souvent un obstacle majeur à l'emploi.  </p>
<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463937747/logement_davfkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 99.4757px;height: 109px;""/>      <b>La sécurité et l'accès au logement</b></p>
<p>Pour sortir de la prostitution, plusieurs femmes ont besoin de quitter un conjoint, un milieu malsain ou de simplement laisser derrière elles leur ancienne vie. Le Fonds nous permettra de supporter financièrement le déménagement d'une femme vers un lieu plus sûr. Le sentiment de sécurité après avoir fui une situation violente étant également un enjeu crucial, le Fonds nous permettra d'offrir l'installation de systèmes d'alarme ainsi que des cours  d'autodéfense.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463937804/mobilit%C3%A9_pwrxxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 137.31372549019608px;height: 94px;""/> <b>La mobilité </b></p>
<p>La pauvreté, comme obstacle majeur à la réinsertion, prend plusieurs formes. C'est le cas entre autre de la difficulté à défrayer des frais de déplacements, que ce soit pour chercher un emploi, aller à l'école ou encore se rendre à des rendez-vous médicaux. Le Fonds de solidarité nous permettra d'offrir des passes de métro mensuelles ou annuelles à des femmes, des cours de conduite ou des vélos afin de favoriser leur mobilité tant physique que sociale.</p>

Bref résumé
Depuis maintenant 11 ans, la CLES soutient les femmes qui souhaitent sortir de la prostitution ou qui en sont sorties.
À travers les 600 contacts que nous avons par année avec des survivantes de la prostitution, nous avons pu constater que la pauvreté est un obstacle majeur à la sortie de la prostitution et qu'il n'existe aucun soutien financier direct pour aider les femmes. 
C'est pourquoi nous avons mis sur pied le Fonds de solidarité!
Il nous permet de soutenir financièrement les projets des femmes afin de faciliter leur sortie et leur après-sortie. Ce Fonds ne reçoit aucun financement gouvernemental. Il repose entièrement sur vos dons!
En donnant au Fonds de solidarité, vous soutenez concrètement les femmes dans leur sortie de la prostitution. 
Aucun argent ne va à l'organisme.  

Ce dont nous avons besoin...

Nous souhaitons amasser 10 000$ . Ce montant nous permettra de soutenir les projets des femmes en lien avec... 


    Le cheminement scolaire et professionnel 

Les Fonds amassés nous permettront de défrayer des frais d'inscription au secondaire, au cégep ou à l'université, de fournir des ordinateurs ou du matériel scolaire ou encore, d'effectuer une demande de pardon judiciaire, le casier criminel étant souvent un obstacle majeur à l'emploi.  
            La sécurité et l'accès au logement
Pour sortir de la prostitution, plusieurs femmes ont besoin de quitter un conjoint, un milieu malsain ou de simplement laisser derrière elles leur ancienne vie. Le Fonds nous permettra de supporter financièrement le déménagement d'une femme vers un lieu plus sûr. Le sentiment de sécurité après avoir fui une situation violente étant également un enjeu crucial, le Fonds nous permettra d'offrir l'installation de systèmes d'alarme ainsi que des cours  d'autodéfense.
  La mobilité 
La pauvreté, comme obstacle majeur à la réinsertion, prend plusieurs formes. C'est le cas entre autre de la difficulté à défrayer des frais de déplacements, que ce soit pour chercher un emploi, aller à l'école ou encore se rendre à des rendez-vous médicaux. Le Fonds de solidarité nous permettra d'offrir des passes de métro mensuelles ou annuelles à des femmes, des cours de conduite ou des vélos afin de favoriser leur mobilité tant physique que sociale.
             La famille et les loisirs
Les hobbys et les passes-temps sont bénéfiques pour la santé mentale, particulièrement lorsqu'on a vécu des traumatismes. De plus, de nombreuses femmes ayant un vécu en lien avec la prostitution ont des enfants, avec qui elles souhaitent passer du temps de qualité. Le Fonds de solidarité nous permettra d'offrir à des femmes et à leurs enfants des moments de répit (camps de jour et activités parascolaires) et de qualité en famille (sorties et activité familiales).
 La santé
Les femmes ayant un vécu en lien avec la prostitution ont de grands besoins en lien avec la santé, tant physique que mentale et les services ne sont pas toujours accessibles. Le Fonds nous permettra de défrayer des coûts de psychothérapie ou encore des soins chez le dentiste, des lunettes ou d'autres services essentiels pourtant couteux.

Ainsi vous pourrez recevoir des poèmes inédits, des cartes de souhaits faites à la main par les femmes, un calendrier féministe et plein d'autres choses encore!

About Us
Because of its focus on film music Film Fest Gent launched the World Soundtrack Academy in 2001. The World Soundtrack Academy is aimed at organizing and overseeing
the educational, cultural and professional aspects of the art of film music,
including the preservation of the history of the soundtrack and its worldwide
promotion. 
The World Soundtrack Awards (#WSAwards) are awarded
annually to mark and celebrate outstanding achievements in scoring music for
motion pictures and television. Since
many years, the WSAwards successfully put both established and upcoming film
music composers in the limelight. We believe film music deserves appropriate
recognition for its integral role in filmmaking.
This year the World Soundtrack Awards will be a two night event with television music as its central theme. On October 19 there will be an Awards Gala with a concert of temporary tv-scores (House of Cards, Mad Men, Dr. Who, Fargo,...) performed by Brussels Philharmonic conducted by Dirk Brossé. The second night, October 20 will repeat this concert and will also include another performance going back to the television series of our youth (Star Trek, Dallas, Man from U.N.C.L.E.,...).Tickets can be found here and here.

You can see and hear a lot more on my website at <a href=""http://www.damianclarke.co.uk,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.damianclarke.co.uk,</a> or go on youtube at <a href=""https://youtu.be/OWBwFOd2pDE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/OWBwFOd2pDE</a><br/>I have a new CD album being launched on May 30th 2016, with 14 songs and tunes, mostly featuring the Dulcimer which I am on a mission to bring to people's ears, so that they too will fall in love with it. This is where you can help me. I want to promote this album in the press and to lots of Radio stations around the world and that needs a budget. <br/>I sell CDs mainly at concerts and whenever I busk and this way I overcome the hurdles of not being a mainstream musician with an easily marketable style and persona. After all, I'm a nearly 58, a white, bald, bearded man who doesn't know when to shut up. But as one of the songs on the CD says, ""Nobody's written the Rules"" and I'm proud to be just as creative and motivated, if not more so, as I was at 18. <br/>I am very excited that this CD, unlike my first two solo CDs, will feature mostly my own songs, plus a couple from friends who have written music and words that have been important to me. So this CD is like my autobiography.<br/>Also, I have discovered that I love combining opportunities to play music alongside my artwork. So, I have started to include texts or even lyrics within some of my paintings. I always use an original painting as the starting point for the CD artwork and these always sell straightaway. So I have decided to offer the originals for the inner and outer covers as part of this funding campaign.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I am looking for a promotional budget of at least £1500.  I want to take out ads in some recognised international music magazines and most importantly send the CD to loads of radio stations:
<p>Advert in FRoots, UK magazine: £350<br/>Advert in R2 UK magazine: £250<br/>Advert in Folker, German magazine: £300<br/>Advert in Living Tradition : UK magazine £250<br/>Misc adverts in various smaller folk magazines: £150<br/>Postage to 100 radio stations: £200<br/></p>
<p>I can offer some great perks, if you'd like to support me beyond buying a CD (which is always appreciated!) I have three original paintings at a special price for this campaign, which were used to create the artwork for the CD cover. I have prints taken from these images which I embellish so that each one is slightly unique. So you can own a piece of original art from my own hand that relates to the CD. <br/></p>
<p>I am also offering to play a house concert for you, or a fundraiser for a charity that you support.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Doing it my way!<br/>
</h3> <p>I have always enjoyed the way that we can carve out our own path and not have to fit into the mainstream. The punk revolution in the mid 70's co-incided with my time at Art College and an incredibly important time for me, opening my ideas to possibilities and ambitions that I had hitherto never dreamed as possible, along with many other people at that time.  <br/></p>
<p>I really want the Hammer Dulcimer (and the Hurdy Gurdy) to be enjoyed by as many people as possible, but the guitar seems to rule the folk world at the moment and many promoters are nervous at putting on a Dulcimer concert as they think audiences don't know about the instrument. So, I have to break the mould, introduce it and then I KNOW that most people are intrigued and love the sound.</p>
<p>By advertising and getting the CD on the radio, I can do this, but it is expensive. So your extra support really helps me to do this. I will use as much of the funding as I receive to fund the promotion.  <br/></p> </div> <div> You are welcome to come and see the paintings in real life. I can bring them to gigs, or show them at my Open Studios. I will be open every day between May 28th and June 12th as part of Dorset Arts Weeks and before / after that by appointment. <br/>I have a proven track record of selling paintings and prints over the last 5 years. My first two CD cover paintings both sold on the first day they were exhibited. All three paintings use the idea of words and ideas creating unforeseen waves, echoing and impacting on those around us, changing the direction of our lives, merging with others, or breaking up and dissolving into a new idea. The paintings relate to the song ""One more Gaudy Night"" starting with a quote from Anthony and Cleopatra. The lyrics refer to my relationships, with my wife and family, touring and Pressgang.  ""Something to say"" 1 and 2 both contain lyrics from that song. I have always believed strongly in freedom of speech but for some years I kept my council rather than be outspoken. But now I am freed to speak out again and hopefully support those for whom that is difficult, or even life-threatening. The paintings are darker yet with glimpses of light shining through.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please feel free to share this campaign via Social Media. There are thousands of people who know me from playing with Pressgang and who may well want to support me.  <br/>

The paintings relate to the song ""One more Gaudy Night"" starting with a quote from Anthony and Cleopatra. The lyrics refer to my relationships, with my wife and family, touring and Pressgang.  ""Something to say"" 1 and 2 both contain lyrics from that song. I have always believed strongly in freedom of speech but for some years I kept my council rather than be outspoken. But now I am freed to speak out again and hopefully support those for whom that is difficult, or even life-threatening. The paintings are darker yet with glimpses of light shining through.
  Other Ways You Can HelpPlease feel free to share this campaign via Social Media. There are thousands of people who know me from playing with Pressgang and who may well want to support me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We truly believe our project is important for everyone. It's time to push creativity onto a new level and make it mass action. The festival offers opportunities for cutting-edge artists. It combines technology, imagination, and the current generation of young talents. </p>
<p>Every voice counts and right now we need your support. This will give us the energy to continue our mission and fulfill the vision of the festival we have. </p>We need to buy round-trip flights for 23 musicians, composers and artists from around the globe who will travel to Armenia as participants to the festival. We have managed to cover most of the participants expenditures already and just a little is left to raise. With your help we will be able to support the rest, as well as a few additional costs, such as performance equipment and recording studio fees. </div>

<p>The festival is organised by “Progressive Art Agency”,<span style=""background-color: initial;""> an international artistic collective, working together to produce art that crosses all borders and disciplines. Working with artists, composers, musicians, directors, and cinematographers, we aim to create an artistic experience like no other. We promote the work of musicians, composers, and artists from across the globe. The organisation aims to cross borders both artistically and politically by striving to create unity across the world’s divides and by promoting upcoming talent and celebrating some of the world’s unknown gems. It is a group that goes beyond promotion by producing projects, masterclasses, and contemporary art and music events.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ProArt main team members are: Van Sarkissian, Ben Lunn, and Assel Abilseitova. Being classical musicians and composers ourselves, we understand the demands of today's art scene. We aim to be a stimulus for the progression of art and to be the producers of the next daring cultural and artistic events. </p>

 Ensemble x.y. is a contemporary ensemble that commissions and performs new music in a flexible and ever-changing lineup. Formed in late 2014, Ensemble x.y seeks to add to the music of the 21st Century by commissioning young composers and performing thematically charged programmes that combine newly commissioned works with the often underplayed works of the modern era.



And many other great performers, artists and composers



So far we have united composers from the USA, UK, China, Switzerland, Russia, Thailand and other countries; Contemporary music performers from France, Turkey, the UK, Armenia, Spain, Kazakhstan, Switzerland; and fine artists, who are leading figures of the Armenian art scene.
12 composers, 12 artists, 19 international musicians and 3 Armenian musicians will gather together for 6 days of events that will consist of masterclasses, seminars, HassGuitarFest, street performances, concerts and a final Flashmob, where every visitor will get the chance to take part in the creation of an artwork. For this, we have provided over 25 meters of canvas. All performances will be professionally recorded and presented at the Dalan Art Gallery with earphones attached to the artworks.

    

We truly believe our project is important for everyone. It's time to push creativity onto a new level and make it mass action. The festival offers opportunities for cutting-edge artists. It combines technology, imagination, and the current generation of young talents. 
Every voice counts and right now we need your support. This will give us the energy to continue our mission and fulfill the vision of the festival we have. We need to buy round-trip flights for 23 musicians, composers and artists from around the globe who will travel to Armenia as participants to the festival. We have managed to cover most of the participants expenditures already and just a little is left to raise. With your help we will be able to support the rest, as well as a few additional costs, such as performance equipment and recording studio fees. 



        

Accommodation for international participants
Flight tickets for performers and artists
Recording sessions
Equipment hire

The festival is organised by “Progressive Art Agency”, an international artistic collective, working together to produce art that crosses all borders and disciplines. Working with artists, composers, musicians, directors, and cinematographers, we aim to create an artistic experience like no other. We promote the work of musicians, composers, and artists from across the globe. The organisation aims to cross borders both artistically and politically by striving to create unity across the world’s divides and by promoting upcoming talent and celebrating some of the world’s unknown gems. It is a group that goes beyond promotion by producing projects, masterclasses, and contemporary art and music events.

The ProArt main team members are: Van Sarkissian, Ben Lunn, and Assel Abilseitova. Being classical musicians and composers ourselves, we understand the demands of today's art scene. We aim to be a stimulus for the progression of art and to be the producers of the next daring cultural and artistic events. 


Main Staff
Van Sarkissian - General Director


""Art has been as active as a volcano in particular periods of time, like the Renaissance in Florence or Modernism in Paris. Modernism is one of the brightest moments in cultural history, where artists, writers and musicians such as Picasso and Stravinsky came to Paris and led the cultural movement. The air was thick with art, giving birth to many new artworks and ""ism""s and becoming the centre of development for art at that time. Our aim is to recreate this formula, where we can fill the atmosphere with the art of today which will hopefully give birth to many new cultural horizons.""
 Assel Abilseitova- Deputy Director, Project manager

      ""I've always thought that I am lucky to be a musician, that I have this opportunity to express myself . The idea that only a selected group of people are involved in creative arts and have it as an important part of their lives just doesn't sound right to me. The festival aims to attract attention to different arts and music, to challenge the imagination, to get outside the box and explore more"".                                                                                                                                                                                                     

Ben Lunn- Program Director & Head of International Department



""When I started discussing this project with Assel and Van, I felt amazingly driven and animated. I was overjoyed for two reasons: firstly, I thought it was a truly noble endeavour to join artists from a variety of backgrounds with composers. But I also find the idea of using art and culture to bring nations and people closer together is such a vital thing and this project is a great opportunity to do so. Supporting this project and festival will help increase the success of such a noble goal"".

I created a 3D-printed system that allows guitarists to quickly and simply change guitar pickups through the back of the guitar--think of video game cartridges except each cartridge contains your favorite pickup. It's different than anything out there because pickup cartridges are held in place with a set on magnets instead of clips that tend to break...and, it's 3D-printed so any style of guitar pickup can be used.
I've been promoting the quick-connect pickup system for the last several months to see what sort of traction I could get in the marketplace. The system has received notable press from the tech, guitar, and 3D-printing industry (www.psfk.com, www.ultimate-guitar.com, www.3dprint.com).
Now it is time to take the design to the next step and apply for a patent.
To apply for a patent with the U.S. government, I am trying to raise $5,000 in 50 days. The funds will mostly go to lawyers.
I have set up four funding levels, all of which have perks:



Level 1: Donation amount = $10 (perk = receive a Strassell Guitar sticker)


Level 2: Donation amount = $20 (perk = receive a Strassell Guitar beverage koozie)


Level 3: Donation amount = $30 (perk = receive a Strassell Guitar t-shirt)


Level 4: Donation amount = $50 (perk = receive a Strassell Guitar sticker, koozie, and t-shirt)


Or, if you just want to donate and not request a perk there is an option to do so.
If I don't reach my goal, I will donate a portion of the funds raised to a charity.
I realize that not everyone is able to donate. That's okay. I encourage you to spread the word. Thanks.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

FAQs



What happens if we do not reach our initial target?  In this case we will prioritise the production of the book.
Can we deliver the products?  We have considerable experience across our volunteers in  media production.  Burgs has already self-published three books. Burgs has had a great following on Soundcloud for some years now and we are confident that the album will be hugely popular. We believe we have an excellent track record on managing our projects and delivering projected outcomes.
Why are we self publishing this book?  The book is a response to current predicaments. Things are changing so fast, and we need to get motivated and galvanised right now in search of positive solutions. The time that it will take to bring this book to print through conventional publishers is just too long.
What happens if we exceed our initial target?  All additional and on-going  funding will contribute to making as much of our library available to a wider audience.  This will involve funding as many people as possible to work on editing the material and preparing it for distribution.





We appreciate that not everyone can afford to contribute money to support us. However, if the Give Back Generation resonates with you then please do spread the word with your friends and contacts. Send them links to this campaign or  The Art of Mediation or the Give Back Generation.
