<p>Would you like to have a mobile app where you can create an adventure, then have your friends join you? Or how about an app, when you visit a new city, can lead you on an journey to find and explore the 10 best coffee shops, places to eat or visit? Imagine an app that can do all that –  and allow you to set up fun competition for points, awards and more with your friends through your favorite social networks. This is the world of nJoy.</p>
<p>nJoy was originally conceived as an educational scavenger hunt app where teachers could create a hunt for students. The idea was, let's suppose the class was studying trees. The teacher would create a hunt with the type of trees that the student should find. The teacher could choose to either indicate where the trees are located or leave it to the students to find them independently. The teacher could insert a picture of the each tree so the students would know what to look for, or possibly even give them the geo-coordinates of the trees for which they would be searching.</p>
<p>It didn’t take us long to realize this app would not only be great for educators, but almost anyone could use this app to create their own adventures and share them with their friends.</p>
<h3>What Makes nJoy Different</h3>
<p>nJoy is different from other scavenger hunt apps. Not only can you create a hunt, but you can add points, awards, or prizes. You can choose to have an open hunt, where it is just a matter of finding the items, or a structured hunt where you need to find the location, or a hint, before you receive the next location. Here is a short list of some of the features we feel will make nJoy the app of choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can design multiple types and structures of hunts</li>
<li>You can assign points, awards, badges etc. </li>
<li>Share your hunts through you favorite social networks, with anyone or make them invitation only with your friends </li>
<li>Play collaboratively or competitively, alone or in teams</li>
<li>Share your hunts –  for others to download and play with their friends</li>
<li>Download special hunts that lead you to adventures in new cities, parks, museums, and other popular attractions.</li>
</ul><h3>The Vision for nJoy</h3>
<p>We see an app that is used to explore the physical world in a fun and social adventure. Here are a few examples of how we see nJoy being used and enjoyed.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Tom  </strong>I’m Tom and I’m creating a hunt for my cousin Gregg’s birthday party. He and his friends are big into sports memorabilia so I’m creating a hunt for them to visit the 10 top memorabilia spots in our city of St. Louis. I’ve programmed in the sequence of places I want them to visit. They get a clue, and off they go. Once they find the spot programmed, the app will tell them what they need to find and take a picture of, then give them the next clue for the next spot. It’s set up in teams so I expect 2 to 3 people per team going out and competing. It all ends at one of our favorite sport bars where we can share our pics and stories of the hunt – and oh yeah celebrate Gregg’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: Stacie  </strong>I’m a teacher for 7th grade science and we have a field trip coming up to the Museum of Natural Science. I’ve put together a hunt for my students so that as they go through the museum they will have to find certain exhibits. When they find the exhibit, they will get special information that I’ve added about the exhibits for them. There are certain items I want them to take pictures of, and then we are going to use these in the classroom the next day. A friend of mine Lea is really into museums and she wants to use the hunt next time she goes just to have an added experience. I’m pretty sure Lea and my students are going to have a lot of fun with this hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: Mike &amp; Sheryl  </strong>A small group of us are heading out to bike through the Sonoma Valley. We noticed in our nJoy app a downloadable hunt for the Best 15 Kept Secrets of the Sonoma Valley. So we’re going to download it and use the hunt as our way creating our route. The six of us going, think this will be very exciting. The description says it includes eateries, wineries and secluded spots for picnicking. Best yet it was made by another bicyclist who mentions that it doesn’t backtrack. We are all really looking forward to this trip – Last one to the next spot picks up the tab.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Kurtz</strong>, Instructional Design Program Manager at Dreem Digital. Jeff has a passion for the use of mobile technology in the classroom as a tool for engaging students in an authentic learning environment. He believes the teacher is the key contributor to making mobile technology the most effective. He received his Master’s Degree at Willamette University’s Graduate School of Education in Teaching, authorized in Early Childhood, Elementary, and ESOL. Mr. Kurtz has worked with children for over 18 years and has been teaching in the classroom for 2 years. As an ELD teacher at Boones Ferry Primary School, in Wilsonville, Oregon, he has been innovative in using iPads and sound pedagogy with his K-5 students.  Jeff provides a hands-on experience with mobile technology focused on helping teachers engage students and enhance the effect of instruction. Jeff is the father of three boys with a background in youth programming, music, art, and drama. </p>
<p><strong>Laura Levin</strong> is an Instructional Design Program Manager with Dreem Digital. She brings with her over 8 years of graphic design experience in education settings. She brings with her a number of different languages that she can work in and has experience working with collegiate websites and learning management systems. She received her B.F.A. from Colorado State University and a Web designer Certificate from the Pittsburgh Art Institute.</p>
<p><strong>John Marr</strong> has been developing software for over 20 years. In addition to programming he is experienced in graphic design, creating both illustration and digital artwork. John has managed the development of more than 50 apps placed in the iTunes Store and these apps have had accumulated millions of downloads. Some of his apps have been featured on the front page of the Apple App Store worldwide. Seven of his apps are in the top 10 of Free Music Downloads in 34 countries and commanding 18 of the top 20 spots in China.</p>
<h3>What Will We Do With Your Contributions</h3>
<p>Your contributions will be going directly to building nJoy. We will be paying information architects, instructional designers, graphic artists, and programmers. We also are working on some great in-app content and a small portion will be spent on obtaining this content. The more we raise, the more features we can program at launch and beyond. </p>
<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>We appreciate any person who wants to contribute any amount to this project. We would like to point a few items on the rewards. Each Founder Level will have a unique Gamer's Badge that will be awared to that individual's account. These badges will only be available for the founders through this campaign, and you earn social bragging rights since your badges will be available to be seen in your nJoy public profile and your name will be included in the credits.</p>
<p>Another great feature starts at the Gold Level Founder ($75). At this level and above you are invited to create and name a hunt that will be included in the app. If you really want to be part of shaping the app we have ten (10) spots available that will get you invited to a prodcution team meeting where you will have a chance to provide your input towards the completed game.</p>
<h3>Why Support This App</h3>
<p>nJoy started as a basic educational app with a few functions. At the same time we were looking for a way to offset some of the programming costs because our goal was (and still is) to provide this to classrooms for free as a learning resource. We started to realize that the concept had merit well beyond the classroom,  and to make the app really unique and fun, the feature list and the cost to produce this app increased. One of our staff suggested crowdfunding and the two ideas merged. Let's create a killer app out of the box versus a basic educational app, and to fund it, energize a community interested in this app becoming a reality for gaming and education.</p>
<p>We believe this app is one that you will be proud to be a part of creating and that it will add to fun and excitement of many lives. We would ask yu to please consider contributing to this project which will help many school children learn and can be enjoyed by almost anyone who want to explore their world. Please consider liking our project and telling all of your friends whether you contribute or not.</p>

This project represents phase one of my effort to publish a card game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Gods of Fantasy"" is a card game that puts you in control of fantasy creatures. You act like a God and you lead a tactical fight. Each player plays cards from their own hand. You can have Creature and Items cards. The Adventure cards are drawn from a central draw pile. </div>
<div>The game is simple enough that it can be learned and played in a short time, and the battles are different each time you play a new game. This is a game for 2-4 players and pairs. You can play ""Gods of Fantasy"" on your own, but you will lose much of the surprises. Experienced players should be able to finish one game in 30 minutes.<br/><br/>To win, you must be the only one that has one or more cards in your hand.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.croweb.net/gof/t-goal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<div>The goal of my project is to raise the funds necessary to pay art work and produce the initial print run of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""Gods of Fantasy""</span>. I will also set up a professional website.<br/> <br/>I really want this project to succeed – I am not interested in profit.<br/><br/>

<div> </div></div>","I'm excited to show you a game I've been working on called ""Gods of Fantasy"". This project represents phase one of my effort to publish a card game.
 
""Gods of Fantasy"" is a card game that puts you in control of fantasy creatures. You act like a God and you lead a tactical fight. Each player plays cards from their own hand. You can have Creature and Items cards. The Adventure cards are drawn from a central draw pile. 
The game is simple enough that it can be learned and played in a short time, and the battles are different each time you play a new game. This is a game for 2-4 players and pairs. You can play ""Gods of Fantasy"" on your own, but you will lose much of the surprises. Experienced players should be able to finish one game in 30 minutes.To win, you must be the only one that has one or more cards in your hand.

The goal of my project is to raise the funds necessary to pay art work and produce the initial print run of ""Gods of Fantasy"". I will also set up a professional website. I really want this project to succeed – I am not interested in profit.


The deck of cards contain 72 cards. Each deck represents the unique creatures, items and adventure cards. The cards are well-balanced and competitive straight out of the box. This guarantees that you will have a satisfyingly unique game experience every time.Each copy includes: 1. 72 card deck designed by professional artistsa) 24 creature cardsb) 12 item cardsc) 16 adventure cardsd) 2 bonus cardse) 18 manual cards - full color with rules and lots of examples of play

 
Setup
 
This game can be played in following setups and modes:1. 2 players (classic 1 vs. 1)2. 3 players (single-attack and multi-attack mode)3. 4 players (single-attack and multi-attack mode)4. 2 vs. 2 (playing in pairs)

Turn overview

 
Each turn has three phases (A, B and C) in the order shown:A. Deploy phase - deploying the Creature and Item cardsB. Adventure phase - resolving the Adventure cardC. Clean-up phase - cleaning upAfter the players complete all three phases, one turn ends.To win, you must be the only one that has one or more cards in your hand.There is only one deck and that's it! You don't have to buy special cards to make better decks!

<h1>How is this possible?</h1>
<p></p>Our game is based on multiple REST API’s. This is the state of the art of web apps and websites.<br/>We use this technology and our experience in crafting websites to make it possible to create a real multi platform game.<br/>A non relational database in a cloud computing environment gives us the required performance and freedom to realize such an innovative project.<br/>Our
 team provides more than 10 years experience in developing high 
performance websites. During the last years we worked on several 
international projects.<p></p>
<h1>Game Scenario of our Sci-Fi MMORPG</h1>
<p>The
 scenario is a mix of science fiction and post apocalyptic disaster. The
 game is derived on recent scientific accomplishments. You are a citizen
 trying to survive in a world which is permanently changing, depending 
on the choices you make. Every player can change the world drastically. 
Your choices decide about the metropolis Welkins rise or fall. Explore 
districts, investigate mysteries and comb freely through every single 
building. Not a single day will be like the other.</p>

<h1>Story Impressions</h1>
<p>""Slightly dizzy, Caleb opened his 
eyes. The heart throbbed and the world around him shimmered a little 
cloudy. His gaze was directed towards the window watching the golden 
glance of the evening sun passing by. The digital clock was standing 
cold next to it. The last thing he remembered was the clock radiating 
the time into the room, which Caleb avowedly did not know anymore. Now 
it stopped working. He had survived! Whatever it was, Caleb had 
survived! The next moment he noticed a robot at the door from the corner
 of his eye. As the rear lights of an electric car at night, the two red
 eyes wandered hastily out the door. Caleb felt weak and realized that 
this must have been mere imagination, as the eyes of the Robot have been
 red instead of blue. For a moment he sat there quiet...""</p>
<h1><b>Personal Customization</b></h1>
<p>With
 over 1.000.000 various outfit combinations you have the possibility to create 
your very own individual character, buy estates, rent an apartment and 
join a company. You can buy these features with real world money. </p>

 our city you will find RMS. These stores are fully integrated in our 
gaming world. This means you have to visit a RMS to spend real money.

favourite item, a journey to the right store is necessary.</p>

<h1><b>PvP</b></h1>
<p>PvP is an important aspect of SUN2020. You 
have the chance to win a league or a tournament, no matter how long you 
have been a citizen in Welkin.</p>
<p>SUN2020 will provide official 
leagues and tournaments. Here you can show your skills and rise to the 
top of the leagues. The rewards will increase your reputation compared 
to other gamers.</p>
<p>Furthermore you can create your own PvP challenges.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Dynamic Environment</h1>
<p>The
 urban scenario is divided into rings. Each ring has a diameter of 2 
kilometers and by default each additional ring increases the living 
area. Each ring consists of 4 districts and all have their own 
construction style. The whole metropolis is linked through the U-Line. 
The world can change drastically, through random activated events, which
 all are twisted and intertwined. On one day whole districts can fall 
victim to destruction or prosper depending on each player's decisions. </p>
<p>Everything you do has consequences.</p>

<p>The most noticeable feature about SUN2020 is that an in-game 
death is permanent. If you die in Welkin your account will be lost and 
there is no way to regain access to it. Be aware that failing in normal 
fights and normal events will not kill you. You have to be in dangerous 
locations and/or take part in special events to actually die.</p>

How is this possible?
Our game is based on multiple REST API’s. This is the state of the art of web apps and websites.We use this technology and our experience in crafting websites to make it possible to create a real multi platform game.A non relational database in a cloud computing environment gives us the required performance and freedom to realize such an innovative project.Our
 team provides more than 10 years experience in developing high 
performance websites. During the last years we worked on several 
international projects.
Game Scenario of our Sci-Fi MMORPG
The
 scenario is a mix of science fiction and post apocalyptic disaster. The
 game is derived on recent scientific accomplishments. You are a citizen
 trying to survive in a world which is permanently changing, depending 
on the choices you make. Every player can change the world drastically. 
Your choices decide about the metropolis Welkins rise or fall. Explore 
districts, investigate mysteries and comb freely through every single 
building. Not a single day will be like the other.

Story Impressions
""Slightly dizzy, Caleb opened his 
eyes. The heart throbbed and the world around him shimmered a little 
cloudy. His gaze was directed towards the window watching the golden 
glance of the evening sun passing by. The digital clock was standing 
cold next to it. The last thing he remembered was the clock radiating 
the time into the room, which Caleb avowedly did not know anymore. Now 
it stopped working. He had survived! Whatever it was, Caleb had 
survived! The next moment he noticed a robot at the door from the corner
 of his eye. As the rear lights of an electric car at night, the two red
 eyes wandered hastily out the door. Caleb felt weak and realized that 
this must have been mere imagination, as the eyes of the Robot have been
 red instead of blue. For a moment he sat there quiet...""
Personal Customization
With
 over 1.000.000 various outfit combinations you have the possibility to create 
your very own individual character, buy estates, rent an apartment and 
join a company. You can buy these features with real world money. 



Outfit Variations
Pay to Win
Regardless of how much money you spend, it 
won't make you faster, stronger or better than any other gamer. Every 
purchase is optional. You will have the full gaming experience of 
SUN2020 without spending any money - no ""Pay to Win""
RMS - Real money stores
As a player
In
 our city you will find RMS. These stores are fully integrated in our 
gaming world. This means you have to visit a RMS to spend real money. 
Each store sells specific features/clothes. If you want to have your 
favourite item, a journey to the right store is necessary.









As a backerYou get the chance to own a RMS. 
Choose your preferred interiors and place your real world 
advertisements. Due to our game mechanics the players are forced to 
visit your shop.


PvP
PvP is an important aspect of SUN2020. You 
have the chance to win a league or a tournament, no matter how long you 
have been a citizen in Welkin.
SUN2020 will provide official 
leagues and tournaments. Here you can show your skills and rise to the 
top of the leagues. The rewards will increase your reputation compared 
to other gamers.
Furthermore you can create your own PvP challenges.

Dynamic Environment
The
 urban scenario is divided into rings. Each ring has a diameter of 2 
kilometers and by default each additional ring increases the living 
area. Each ring consists of 4 districts and all have their own 
construction style. The whole metropolis is linked through the U-Line. 
The world can change drastically, through random activated events, which
 all are twisted and intertwined. On one day whole districts can fall 
victim to destruction or prosper depending on each player's decisions. 
Everything you do has consequences.







Map with 2 rings
Special Events
In addition to the daily struggle 
for survival, unique special events occur. Epic challenges with multiple
 stages and game changing consequences.
Joining forces will be essential for survival.
Every special event is nonrecurrent. You get only one chance to take part.






Epic Boss

Permanent Death

The most noticeable feature about SUN2020 is that an in-game 
death is permanent. If you die in Welkin your account will be lost and 
there is no way to regain access to it. Be aware that failing in normal 
fights and normal events will not kill you. You have to be in dangerous 
locations and/or take part in special events to actually die.
Be aware that your death is permanent.

Blackwyrm Books And Games is a publisher of experimental fiction and quality roleplaying games. In conjunction with Hero Games' release of the Star Hero 6th Edition roleplaying game at GenCon 2011, we are attempting to simultaneously release seven science fiction settings that can be played using the Star Hero rules.  
 
We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar. 




The Impact

Hero Games isn't planning on releasing any settings for Star Hero: only the core rulebook and some equipment books. We are hoping to ""fill the gap"" that leaves by releasing unique and interesting setting books that can be used to play the game immediately, rather than forcing Game Masters to take the time to create their own setting. 
 
Posthegemony: Terra Nomenklatura for HERO System 6th Edition is one of these settings. 



What We Need & What You Get

Posthegemony: Terra Nomenklatura (by Jason Walters) is a unique science fiction setting designed to evoke the mood of films such as Logan’s Run, The Island, and Idiocracy. Using a decision chart and guided by the game master, the players construct a spaceship and escape from the Posthegemony, a futuristic worldwide society loosely based on Chinese utopian ideals.

Interpersonal relationships and collective storytelling play a large part in Posthegemony. The player characters (known as “Interesting Persons”) must describe how they meet one another, how they acquire and assemble the parts of their spacecraft, and how they protect one another from “ReEducation” while they do it. They can also “fill in the blanks” of Posthegemony society as they see fit, describing where their characters live, what their particular city is like, and how the peculiar psychological problems inherent in urban living have effected them.

Touch screens seem like the ideal way to control a strategy game, so how come no one has done it yet? Well, with Vanir's Vengeance I aim to strike the ultimate balance between mobility and a full hardcore gaming experience to bring the RTS genre to life in your palms!Vanir's Vengeance will feature three incredible game modes:
A Challenge mode
A Campaign mode
An Online mode
The Challenge ModeThe challenge mode was cleverly designed to hone your skills for campaign and online play through a series of progressively more difficult situations. Campaign ModeCampaign will allow you to play through the epic story and watch as the Vanir expand into a planet inhabited by hostile alien creatures; and as the King of Vanir loses his son in the push for control over this planet.Online Play!The Vanir

Capture the scrapyards to secure income and produce more units!

Conquer your opponents in intense real-time strategical combat!

Cast awesome and original spells and abilities!
The Aesir

Devour your opponents to steal their life and spawn more Aesir!

Destroy the scrapyards to deny your opponents source of income!

Defend your homeland and cast the Vanir back to the skies!
How Can You Help?So why do I need your help? Well, if you choose to donate, your money will be used in one of the following  areas:

Graphics! More units, prettier landscapes and a WAY better overall experience. This is definitely an area of priority for me.

Game Components! Writing a server isn't easy or cheap, but it can be done with a little help :)

A KILLER Online Mode! An online game can't be successful without YOU! You are the most preeminent element of my game!
How Does My Budget Look?


$1500 - Models and Graphics!
I need 4 more Aesir units (Aliens) which should cost $400
I need 5 more Vanir units which should cost $500
I need touch feedback graphics (arrows that show where you ordered units) - Est. Cost - $50
Remaining buttons and logos - $300
Scrapyard graphics - Est. Cost - $250
$500 - Servers!The Server software as well as online map elements will total to $500.$500 +  - REWARDS!Producing and sending the rewards should cost about $500 or slightly more depending on the amount of backers!What's In it for You?Expect quality, expect tournaments, expect prizes, expect an author who will listen to your ideas and work with you; this is what I offer you if you want to join in the process of bringing these ideas to life.Development ProcessI thought it would be pretty cool to let you guys see the whole development process, so I decided to keep footage of gameplay throughout the lifetime of this project.When I first started programming the game, I was using Java and LibGDX. Don't get me wrong, I love LibGDX... but after a month...Month 1 It just wasn't cutting it... This wasn't what I had in mind when I was thinking ""Awesome mobile RTS!""I decided to switch to Unity for the purpose of development time and product quality. I was able to achieve in a day what had taken me months in Java.Month 2 So I continued to fuss around with graphics, with models, with health bars and with networking. Soon or later I had my first version running on android!Month 3At this point in time, I was hooked. I began planning how the final product should be in much greater depth, I began purchasing graphics, I added in a simple combat system.Month 4At this point, I felt as though I had the core mechanics that I wanted, but there was just something missing.. So I got some of my friends (Thanks Victor, Greg and Blake for the input!) to test out the game and tell me what they would like to see changed to make the experience more complete. After this, I added new shaders, better lighting, fixed up the combat system and just had a great time watching things look better and better!Month 5Unit Bios!So, at this point maybe you're interested in the units and what their roles are in this incredible story. I've prepared some info for the units seen above to show you!$2Thanks for Donating $2 :D You get a DRM FREE copy of the game! This means you can install it on as many devices as you like free of charge!$5Wow! $5! You got both the DRM FREE copy of the game AND I will personally thank you from the deepest places in my heart :)$25We're making the big bucks now! For your loyalty and support, I will thank you (Yes, from the deepest places in my heart), send you a DRM FREE copy of the game AND I'll even throw in a 2.5In.

<div><i><b>Why did we start So Wrong! Studios?</b></i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hi, my name is Lauri, and I am the other co-founder of So Wrong Studios. 3D modeling has always been my passion so I studied Digital Arts and Entertainment and got myself ready to go into the industry. But then I met this amazing girl, whom you just met in the video above. She has a condition called Cerebral Palsy, which got worse in the last few years and that made us move to a warmer climate.  But because she didn't want to hold me back from making my dream come true we decided to look for people who have the same passion like me to make games. And we found them. Now we have a good global team with one goal. Make good games.  And just like that So Wrong Studios was born. Like this I can work from home, and take care of my girlfriend at the same time. And I hope that you will help us in making our dream come true.</div>
<div><i><b><br/></b></i></div>
<div><i><b>Why do we ask your help?<br/><br/></b></i></div>
<p>Until now we have been developing these games in our free time. Since most of us have recently (in the last 2 years) graduated we have been developing these games in student/free versions. But in order to publish we need the professional licenses. </p>
<p>Next to this, we need to start up this company. According to Portuguese law we need a minimum of 5000 euro in the bank for that. Once this is done, we can use this money to pay for a part of our licenses.<br/><br/>As mentioned before so far we have been working without pay. We would like to reward the team for all hard work and use a part of the money to bring in new people so we could bring out even better quality games.</p>
<p>We would also like to add a lot more to the games we are promoting here, more information on this you will find down under stretch goals.</p>

</div><div> <h3>Games</h3>
<div>Our goal is to create fun games for all ages. As a start up we have the freedom of trying out different genres so we can find ourselves and define the company along the way. At this moment our main focus is on our mobile game because it is great for a start up to begin with. We have a lot of good ideas in store for the future, but first we need to focus on the present. Because without the present there is no future.</div>
<div>We started out with an endless runner and an RPG, the genres are far from each other but it gives us the ability to grow and find ourselves. So far we have enjoyed working on both games and we know that we can accomplish more given the opportunity. </div>

<div>Blub is an endless runner for mobile which is set under water. At first you will guide ""Blub"" the fish to safety by dodging various kinds of obstacles. The further you play the more dangerous and difficult the waters become.</div>
<div>While you are swim for your life, you also need to be aware of the Sea Stars. Save them from the environment, take them with you on your trip, The Sea Star King has lots of nice things for you that he is willing to give you because you saved his kin.<br/>These go from different player models and different skins to several boosts to make your journey a bit easier from time to time. </div>
<div>
<u>Blub is being developed for Android at the moment and we have plans later on to publish it on iOS as well.</u><br/>

<p>The current version of Blub only shows one kind of an environment though in the future we plan to add multiple kinds of levels with various obstacles and player models. </p>
<p>The additional levels that we would like to implement would mimic those of what we have in the real world. We want to create some hazardous environments to raise ocean and river welfare by showing what those environments are like in the form of our game. <br/><br/>This is a list of environments we would like to implement. Both Polluted and and Beautiful environments to show what should be fixed, and how it actually can be.<br/><br/></p>

</div>
<div>The levels
are full of obstacles of various kinds; some are living while others are solid
objects. The players’ goal is to reach as far as possible by avoiding these
obstacles and gathering Sea Stars and boosts along the way.</div>
<div>So far we have Octopus and swordfish as living obstacle.<br/>You have to try and dodge the grabbing arms of the octopus, or you'll become his lunch. The swordfish likes rigging you on his sword. Don't let him.<br/>We will add a lot more fun living obstacles in here. Depending on the level environment, the obstacles will change accordingly.
</div>
<div>For solid object we have the anchor. Depending on how you'll hit it, you'll either die, because lets face it, an anchor would give anyone a headache if you'd hit it full in the head. Or you'll loose health because you got scarred on your side. Over time you will heal and you can become fully healthy again.</div>
<div>
<br/>We also implemented a fishnet. If you swim in it, the game will be over. But if you hit the sides you might just loose some health. And of course here you can also over time heal up again.</div>
<div>
<br/>There is also the sunken ship which you have to dodge. <br/>Just like with the living obstacles, we will add a lot more obstacles under this category and these will change according to the level environment.</div>

factions are at conflict with one another in a Caribbean environment. The
Imperial pugs and the Purrates have migrated from faraway lands into this new
promising world only to find themselves amongst new people, the Mizetecs.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Of course the Mizetecs want to protect what is theirs and they will fight for what is theirs. But they are also open to diplomacy.<br/></span></p>
<p>At the beginning of the game you will make your unique character from one of the three factions. But depending on what you choose to do in the game you can become friends or enemies with your own and the other factions. Everything is open to what you decide. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is so that when you decide you want to make a new character you will get a full new experience.</span></p>
<p>With this game we promise you endless amount of fun.</p>
<p>We initially considered Purrates as a mobile game though it has grown as a concept beyond the point of being for mobile. From feedback we've learned that a lot of people would be interested in Purrates though if only it were made for PC. <u>Thus we've changed the game to be made for PC and later on we will develop a smaller mobile game based off the gameplay.</u></p>

<p>The Purrates are a
group of cats that seek the pirate way of life in plundering treasure and
living free from chains. While they are not a particularly organized faction
they do follow a simple chain of command that ensures the well being of all
Purrates.</p>
<p>The Purrates are based on the pirates from the 18th century like we know them from the history books. They are mean and viscious but they have their own rules and code that they live by. They do not look kindly on traitors, but that doesn't mean if you want to side with the Mizetecs because hey a cat living between mice, it's just something you want to do, that you can't. You can do whatever you want! But you'll have to live with the wrath of a cat!</p>

<p>The Imperial Pugs
represent law and order in a civilized manner and have migrated from faraway
lands into the new promised land to find new knowledge and riches of the world.
Leading this expedition is their King himself Charles Wrinkles who by example inspires
his nation to greatness.</p>
<p>The Imperial Pugs are based on the 18th century Royal colonies. They would never break rules, but you wouldn't be the first one to turn pirate because you don't like the stiff rules from the Imperium. But know that they'll never stop to hunt you down.</p>

<p>The Mizetecs are the
original inhabitants of this region of the world and have been put to the test
in preserving their culture of cheese and blood rituals by having to fend off
the two occupants. By godly right their high priestess has united the tribes and has taken the
lead role in preserving their society.</p>
<p>The mizetecs are based on the 13th century aztec civilization. They don't like outsiders unless it's to sacrifice them. Only that one rare stranger might be able to worm his way in. While most mizetecs prefer to stay within the safety of their city's wall, some are curious and will venture to sea to protect their homeland.

<b></b><p><span>Combat in Purrates is divided into two parts. The first takes place in form of cannon fire where the player has to weaken its foe to have greater and faster chance of capturing the opponent.</span></p>
<p>Cannon fights will require some tactics as different ship classes will act in different manners in order to try and send you to the locker. Ships vary from firepower, speed, maneuverability to the location of the guns. To ensure you that there will be challenging and unique cannon fights, we have been quite inventive in designing different kinds of ships. When you successfully land hits on your enemies their ships will lose health and crew size. This is crucial to the next phase of combat as you should never attempt to capture or be captured by a ship with larger crew or health than your own.</p>
<p>The second part of combat is all about capturing your opponent. In Purrates you are limited to sail with one ship at a time but you may hold a captured ship under your control. With the second ship, you may either switch to use it as your flagship or you can sail to a port to sell it. Captured ships firepower will not have any effect in battles, only the flagships matter.</p>
<p>Capturing itself is as easy as colliding with your target during combat with capture mode turned on. Once the process has begun the game will give you a time of how long till the ship has been secured. This is not that difficult but while you are performing this action, you are vulnerable to other ships attacks so choose your target and time wisely.</p>

</div></div>","Why did we start So Wrong! Studios?

Hi, my name is Lauri, and I am the other co-founder of So Wrong Studios. 3D modeling has always been my passion so I studied Digital Arts and Entertainment and got myself ready to go into the industry. But then I met this amazing girl, whom you just met in the video above. She has a condition called Cerebral Palsy, which got worse in the last few years and that made us move to a warmer climate.  But because she didn't want to hold me back from making my dream come true we decided to look for people who have the same passion like me to make games. And we found them. Now we have a good global team with one goal. Make good games.  And just like that So Wrong Studios was born. Like this I can work from home, and take care of my girlfriend at the same time. And I hope that you will help us in making our dream come true.

Why do we ask your help?
Until now we have been developing these games in our free time. Since most of us have recently (in the last 2 years) graduated we have been developing these games in student/free versions. But in order to publish we need the professional licenses. 
Next to this, we need to start up this company. According to Portuguese law we need a minimum of 5000 euro in the bank for that. Once this is done, we can use this money to pay for a part of our licenses.As mentioned before so far we have been working without pay. We would like to reward the team for all hard work and use a part of the money to bring in new people so we could bring out even better quality games.
We would also like to add a lot more to the games we are promoting here, more information on this you will find down under stretch goals.

 Games
Our goal is to create fun games for all ages. As a start up we have the freedom of trying out different genres so we can find ourselves and define the company along the way. At this moment our main focus is on our mobile game because it is great for a start up to begin with. We have a lot of good ideas in store for the future, but first we need to focus on the present. Because without the present there is no future.
We started out with an endless runner and an RPG, the genres are far from each other but it gives us the ability to grow and find ourselves. So far we have enjoyed working on both games and we know that we can accomplish more given the opportunity. 




Blub is an endless runner for mobile which is set under water. At first you will guide ""Blub"" the fish to safety by dodging various kinds of obstacles. The further you play the more dangerous and difficult the waters become.
While you are swim for your life, you also need to be aware of the Sea Stars. Save them from the environment, take them with you on your trip, The Sea Star King has lots of nice things for you that he is willing to give you because you saved his kin.These go from different player models and different skins to several boosts to make your journey a bit easier from time to time. 

Blub is being developed for Android at the moment and we have plans later on to publish it on iOS as well.






The current version of Blub only shows one kind of an environment though in the future we plan to add multiple kinds of levels with various obstacles and player models. 
The additional levels that we would like to implement would mimic those of what we have in the real world. We want to create some hazardous environments to raise ocean and river welfare by showing what those environments are like in the form of our game. This is a list of environments we would like to implement. Both Polluted and and Beautiful environments to show what should be fixed, and how it actually can be.
Ganges River (Pollution)Maui Coral Reef (Beauty)Mexico Gulf (Pollution)Amazon Jungle (Beauty)North Atlantic Gyre (Pollution)Lagos Caves (Beauty)Antarctica (Beauty)




The levels
are full of obstacles of various kinds; some are living while others are solid
objects. The players’ goal is to reach as far as possible by avoiding these
obstacles and gathering Sea Stars and boosts along the way.
So far we have Octopus and swordfish as living obstacle.You have to try and dodge the grabbing arms of the octopus, or you'll become his lunch. The swordfish likes rigging you on his sword. Don't let him.We will add a lot more fun living obstacles in here. Depending on the level environment, the obstacles will change accordingly.

For solid object we have the anchor. Depending on how you'll hit it, you'll either die, because lets face it, an anchor would give anyone a headache if you'd hit it full in the head. Or you'll loose health because you got scarred on your side. Over time you will heal and you can become fully healthy again.

We also implemented a fishnet. If you swim in it, the game will be over. But if you hit the sides you might just loose some health. And of course here you can also over time heal up again.

There is also the sunken ship which you have to dodge. Just like with the living obstacles, we will add a lot more obstacles under this category and these will change according to the level environment.




Additional player models
can be purchased from the in game store with Sea Stars you gather by playing the
game. Additional player models will have special abilities that will help you
in certain environments while they might make the game more challenging in
others.





With your help we
would like to add features such as global high scores, missions, achievements
and plenty of content to play through. Everything to ensure countless hours of
fun!






Purrates is our second game which will be for PC. It is an RPG where you as the player are thrown into a fantasy world where three
factions are at conflict with one another in a Caribbean environment. The
Imperial pugs and the Purrates have migrated from faraway lands into this new
promising world only to find themselves amongst new people, the Mizetecs.
Of course the Mizetecs want to protect what is theirs and they will fight for what is theirs. But they are also open to diplomacy.
At the beginning of the game you will make your unique character from one of the three factions. But depending on what you choose to do in the game you can become friends or enemies with your own and the other factions. Everything is open to what you decide. This is so that when you decide you want to make a new character you will get a full new experience.
With this game we promise you endless amount of fun.
We initially considered Purrates as a mobile game though it has grown as a concept beyond the point of being for mobile. From feedback we've learned that a lot of people would be interested in Purrates though if only it were made for PC. Thus we've changed the game to be made for PC and later on we will develop a smaller mobile game based off the gameplay.







The Purrates are a
group of cats that seek the pirate way of life in plundering treasure and
living free from chains. While they are not a particularly organized faction
they do follow a simple chain of command that ensures the well being of all
Purrates.
The Purrates are based on the pirates from the 18th century like we know them from the history books. They are mean and viscious but they have their own rules and code that they live by. They do not look kindly on traitors, but that doesn't mean if you want to side with the Mizetecs because hey a cat living between mice, it's just something you want to do, that you can't. You can do whatever you want! But you'll have to live with the wrath of a cat!



The Imperial Pugs
represent law and order in a civilized manner and have migrated from faraway
lands into the new promised land to find new knowledge and riches of the world.
Leading this expedition is their King himself Charles Wrinkles who by example inspires
his nation to greatness.
The Imperial Pugs are based on the 18th century Royal colonies. They would never break rules, but you wouldn't be the first one to turn pirate because you don't like the stiff rules from the Imperium. But know that they'll never stop to hunt you down.



The Mizetecs are the
original inhabitants of this region of the world and have been put to the test
in preserving their culture of cheese and blood rituals by having to fend off
the two occupants. By godly right their high priestess has united the tribes and has taken the
lead role in preserving their society.
The mizetecs are based on the 13th century aztec civilization. They don't like outsiders unless it's to sacrifice them. Only that one rare stranger might be able to worm his way in. While most mizetecs prefer to stay within the safety of their city's wall, some are curious and will venture to sea to protect their homeland. Once in a while one might find himself compelled to join a different faction and will from then on be marked for death by its own faction.



You will forge your own story as you progress through out the game. At the beginning you may choose your faction and a character that goes with it. After the short tutorial quest can the player begin their adventure as they see fit!





We plan to add various types of ships. Each ship has different attributes and functionality to ensure different gameplay styles. Some ships will be deemed superior for combat while others are more trade orientated. 





Each faction has its own main story line as well as additional side quests and repeatables. The multitude of quests for each faction ensures that the player would have enough content to play enjoy Purrates for a long time to come! 




Actions such as completing quests, battling and trading can earn you reputation points. The reputation of an adventurer in the eyes of the factions comes important when choosing sides as it determines if the player is considered an ally or an enemy in the eyes of the factions. 
By siding with the enemy faction you may be able to switch sides.





Combat in Purrates is divided into two parts. The first takes place in form of cannon fire where the player has to weaken its foe to have greater and faster chance of capturing the opponent.
Cannon fights will require some tactics as different ship classes will act in different manners in order to try and send you to the locker. Ships vary from firepower, speed, maneuverability to the location of the guns. To ensure you that there will be challenging and unique cannon fights, we have been quite inventive in designing different kinds of ships. When you successfully land hits on your enemies their ships will lose health and crew size. This is crucial to the next phase of combat as you should never attempt to capture or be captured by a ship with larger crew or health than your own.
The second part of combat is all about capturing your opponent. In Purrates you are limited to sail with one ship at a time but you may hold a captured ship under your control. With the second ship, you may either switch to use it as your flagship or you can sail to a port to sell it. Captured ships firepower will not have any effect in battles, only the flagships matter.
Capturing itself is as easy as colliding with your target during combat with capture mode turned on. Once the process has begun the game will give you a time of how long till the ship has been secured. This is not that difficult but while you are performing this action, you are vulnerable to other ships attacks so choose your target and time wisely.






Trading is the best way to make money, though it comes with its own set of risks. The concept doesn’t differ that much from real life, buy low sell high. Trading successfully requires a few things. First you need a ship that can carry a decent amount of cargo. Secondly you need a place to buy and a place to sell.There are certain situations where trading really pays off. Certain locations in the world map will occasionally run out of items and creates a shortage of goods. These random events are the most desirable moments a trader is after. Shortages are usually very local though as only the neighboring ports will know of them. 







The first 5000 euro we will use and reuse. How?We need 5000 euro to start up a company officially in Portugal. Once that is in the bank and we deliver proof of that we are allowed to take it out and reuse it for more important things like buying crazy expensive licenses that we sadly enough need.

Here is the breakdown:All of these are single purchase

All of this is the nice sum of 7495 euro.

Where does the rest come in then?
Well, even though we have really enjoyed working on these projects, from time to time we would like to give our team members some motivation in the form of a bonus until we can finalize the games and publish them. We all have worked very hard for the past year and I do believe we all deserve it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

The Atmospheric Sword Dueling Game

 
Short Summary

Ato is a game that is familiar but also non-traditional in several aspects. Unlike most games that have you slaughter hundreds of weak and forgettable enemies, the game focuses those combat sequences on unique and memorable opponents.
​Explore areas, find secrets and obtain new powers as you journey though colorful environments. As you play the game, you will experience atmospheric music both relaxing and combative. The visuals of the game combine both emotive animations with beautiful particle effects. When you come across former members of the clan you served, you will be challenged with a variety of opponents both big and small, each with their own personality and fighting style.
The game is about half way complete and the rest of the content that is going to be added will involve more puzzle types, more secrets to explore, special upgrades, enemy encounters and a completed story arc.

 

What I Need & What You Get

The funding is used to pay for the Steam registration fee, and to pay for marketing costs.
The perks will allow you to secure a PC virtual copy of the game when it comes out as well as other exciting bonuses such as your own character idea as a statue or an actual enemy encounter (click the perks to see more information).

 

The Impact

The goal is to immerse the player into a world with a powerful atmosphere and be transported to a place that is both tranquil and mysterious.
Tell a Visually Driven Story, bypass the language barrier by using little to no words as possible.
Be engaged in tense moments and feel accomplishment when you overcome every obstacle in your path.



Risks & Challenges

I have already shipped finished products onto Steam and Itch.io.
Ato is a very focused game that still requires a lot of work as a solo developer. The unfortunate truth is that while I want to add as much stuff as possible to the game, there is also the limitation of time and energy to reach the end of the project and not constantly add new stuff.



Other Ways You Can Help

Even if you can't contribute financially, you can still be of great help by telling friends about this game. Seriously, it really saves me an arm and a leg.

<p><b>Welcome to Dark Fable Miniature's Temple of Set Indiegogo Campaign.  We have put together an exciting selection of miniatures from one of the most iconic adventure settings in fantasy fiction and films - the temple of Set, the snake god of chaos, evil and violence!  Within this sinister temple are said to be fabulous treasures such as <em><em><strong><em>the Eye of Set, a priceless jewel, guarded by a giant two-headed serpent, the Amphisbaena, which is ever vigilant and always hungry for the flesh of men . . .</em></strong></em></em> It is also a place where unspeakable rituals are performed by the prophet of Set in the flickering light of serpentine braziers.  Who knows what nefarious schemes are being plotted by the prophet of this dark god, who has a host of fanatical priests and merciless temple guards to do his bidding.  Only fools or fearless heroes would dare enter such an evil shrine to challenge the power of the prophet and his minions!</b></p>
<p><b>The Temple of Set Indiegogo campaign is the latest expansion of Dark Fable's pseudo-historical Egyptian range.  The concept and design of the miniatures are a mix of history, archaeology, fantasy fiction and Hollywood films.  The core group of miniatures consists of 6 sets: 1. Temple guards I, 2. Cultists I, 3. Amphisbaena and the Eye of Set, 4. Fearless Heroes, 5. Cultists II, 6. Temple guards II.  There are also a number of stretch goal rewards and add-ons which if unlocked, will expand the number of selections available.  David Soderquist also sculpted a FREE reward figure of the prophet of Set for returning contributors!  I was fortunate enough to recruit a highly talented band of sculpting desperadoes which you will be familiar with from my previous Indiegogo campaigns.  They include the most excellent David Soderquist, the talented Tim Prow, the amazing Andy Peiper and the brilliant Brother Vinni.  </b><em><strong>These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  <i>Check out the gallery for more images!</i></strong></em></p>

Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  Check out the gallery for more images!

 
 
  

 
There are a variety of perks to suit every budget, which range in price from $20 to $310.  Each perk allows you to choose from the 6 core sets of miniatures on offer and/or any of the stretch goal rewards that are unlocked to tailor your order to your own gaming needs.  You may also select as add-ons or perk selections any of the miniatures which were released during our previous Indiegogo campaigns for a flat rate of $12 (unless priced otherwise).
Dark Fable Miniatures is very much a no-frills operation and everyone will receive their sets of miniatures in small zip-lock bags (Sorry no blister packs yet).  We understand that many of you use a variety of basing methods, therefore plastic slotta bases will only be provided if requested.
 


How much is postage?  Postage world-wide is included as part of the perk, and will be sent standard airmail or regular post.  Please note that standard airmail is NOT insured, tracked or signed for.  IF YOU REQUIRE SIGNED, RECORDED OR SPECIAL DELIVERY THAT WILL BE AT YOUR OWN COST.  Please contact me regarding rates.


When can I expect to get my miniatures?  I am hoping to be able to start mailing out orders within a month of the campaign's end - so by the end of April.  The first two master moulds have already been made as well as several production moulds which should allow me to get the miniatures cast relatively quickly.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you all know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.


How do I let you know which packs I have chosen for my perk?  You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign and also select from any stretch goals which have been unlocked.

If you have any questions about any aspect of the campaign please send me a message and I will do my best to answer you.

<p>The player will be taken to the terrifying story of a character lost inside his troubled mind and the terrible world created by his own acts.</p>
<p>The game features both first and third person cameras, changing between the two according to key ingame events that'll take the player through the narrative and the inner workings of the main character's mind and the world around him. There are several puzzles that require the player to investigate the environment and the story of the place. Combat is meant to be reasonably difficult and resources are limited, but sufficient, making for a rewarding challenge to complete.</p>

<p>Gameplay will differ depending on the camera being used at the time. While on first person the player will not be able to fight and will have to either run from danger or rely on stealth to escape. On third person there'll be both melee weapons and guns available to engage in combat.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Third person gameplay brings back the feel and style of several classic horror games, such as Resident evil 1, 2, 3 (Capcom), <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span>Silent hill (Konami) and Clock tower (Human Entertainment), while first person has a few more recent games as reference, like Outlast (Red Barrels), Amnesia (Frictional Games) and Dreadout (Digital Happiness).<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Story</span></strong></p>
<p>Ladybugs, cute – Think again. After an apocalyptic event; and much to the surprise of Darwinians a previously dormant power house of the insect world comes to the fore. As the radiation clouds subside and seismic disturbance diminishes the first organisms to raise their inscrutable heads are Ladybugs. After years of being subjected to humiliating cartoon representations as cute and friendly insects they now have the chance to unlock their dark side. With a motto of “No Mercy – No Exceptions” the Ladybugs set about to make Earth their own.  In the ensuing years the Ladybug juggernaut crushes all before it with a ruthless efficiency that leaves the wasteland devoid of all life but the mighty Ladybug. After a few short years of global dominance these brightly coloured killing machines cast their many eyes towards the heavens with a view to further conquest. Probes were sent to the far reaches of our galaxy and unfortunately for our heroes, with positive results. However these probes have contacted another insectoid civilisation and their many compound eyes have gazed back at earth with desire. The game covers the first forays into earth space by the invaders and the efforts of our cute but cruel defenders.</p>
<p>Take part in the most surreal defence of Earth thus far undertaken. We have a history of successful games behind us but wanted to bring humour and enjoyment on a simple scale back to the gaming environment. So, if you wish to commit wanton mayhem, but with a wry hint of humour, then this is the game for you.  I work 24/7 to transfer my eccentric creations to the digital medium. Along with the rest of the team (2 old but experienced games developers) we have no problem committing the time and energy into this project. We do however require certain bits of software in order to release the game. This is what we are in search of. We have the product we just need help opening the door to the market.

So, make sure you save your ammo for when it counts; sometimes running is the best course of action. Remember you don't have to kill the Legend.

These Volumes will come at no extra cost to you or to anyone once they have purchased the game! We will however increase the price of the game as we create more content for it. So in a nut shell, the more we make for the game the more it will cost. We want to reward early adopters since it was you kind folk that are taking a chance on us. We feel this is a fair plan to cover the cost of future Volumes so we wont have to divide our player base with excessive DLC walls. We want everyone to have access to all the content (With the exception of our Patron Character William Punkie.) So based on how well Horror Legends does after release we can develop addition Volumes in the future.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So Here is a break down of what you all are getting with Volume One's release of the game.

</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>Imagine if you will, watching one of your favorite movies while muting the sound throughout the film.  Albeit the visuals may be stunning, the experience in and of itself would be less than satisfying.  No dialog, no sound effects, no music or atmosphere to carry the plot along.  How about your video games?  What would you think it would be like trying a FPS without audio references to guide you through the game, give you direction, or single out an opponent?  </p>
<p>The lack of audio, on its own, doesn’t necessarily drive the concept that audio is important to film or video games, but it gives us a great jumping off point.  I think we can all agree that without sound, one of the 5 senses that allow us to immerse ourselves both in our reality and fantasy worlds, we would be cognizant of something missing; our immersion that much duller and lacking.</p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">One of the challenges that we are preparing for is managing a budget for the first time. Since 2012 we at October Games have been developing our projects based on our passion alone. Everything from </span><a href=""http://www.octobergames.com/games/puppet-master-the-game-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">Puppet Master: The Game</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, to the </span><a href=""http://www.octobergames.com/events/past-events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">live events</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, the comic, and of course this</span><a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=308849398"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;""> game </a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">have all been created with no funding at all. Having a budget will come with some challenges, but that's to be expected. We are doing what we can to minimize any problems that may come up. The key thing to remember is that this will allow our key players to put in the time they need to get the job done. We have gotten this far with nothing, so think of what we can do with a little help from all you kind folk! </span>
</div>
<div>I would have to say the biggest risk is on my end. I have already put so much of my own time, money, and energy into this project over the past few years, that quitting and going dark is unthinkable to me.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I believe in this project so much that I have kept developing it despite the fact that our<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/octobergames/horror-legends-can-you-scare-your-friends"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Kickstarter from last year </a>didn't reach its goal</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is truly one of my dream projects. I am telling you this to ensure you as potential backers that I will pull through and I will keep my word as I always have. This IndieGoGo campaign, if successful, will help minimize the risk of development. Also, I want you to know that I wont be taking any of the money for me personally. All of the money will be going to key October Games team members so that they can afford to spend the time to work on the game. </span>

</div></div>","Howdy,My name is Drake Kazmierczak and I am a passionate game designer and artist looking for funding to finish one of my dream projects Horror Legends. Please feel free to check out my personal LinkedIn profile to look at my professional work experience. Or you can check octobergames.com, my indie game studio website!First, let me just thank you for checking out my IndieGoGo campaign! I am really excited about what I have to show here, so lets take a look!Nick Gets ItWhat is Horror Legends you ask? Well, its a multiplayer video game inspired by cult classic games like Capcom's Resident Evil: Outbreak series and Monolith's Alien Vs. Predator 2. A one part online cooperative survival horror game, and one monster simulator. Where you can terrorize your friends as a monster of your choosing! I wanted to create a video game that invoked the feeling of the playground classic Ghost in the Graveyard. Something that you and your friends could just pick up and play on the fly and have a great spooky horror experience with. There haven't been to many games after Resident Evil out break that expanded on the multiplayer horror genera. Thus the idea for Horror Legends was born. I have been developing this game slowly in our spare time for years now, and I have come a long way since in those two years completing a large portions of the game, but there are certain tasks I just cannot complete on my own. That's where you can help me out!I need to raise  10,000 dollars so that I can hire key members of my team to work on the game throughout the summer. Which will cost money.  Again we have been working hard on this game for over 2 years and one of our biggest challenges has been finding the time to work on the it. Everyone has bills to pay and things they need to take care of. Paying for their time will alleviate those needs so that they can focus on the game! I want to be clear, none of this money is going to me (Drake). All of it is going to key members of my team! The rest of the game's development has been planned out. I already know who I am going to hire and what they will be working on. Which is primarily finishing programming specific game mechanics, and the sound design elements of the game. Which 75% of the funding will go towards, and the remaining 25% will go towards buying software and hardware licencees. These are much needed tools that will help with the game's development! The goal here is to have something ready to play by Halloween 2016 for you Early Access backers! Then we will work towards releasing the game to the general public in January of 2017. Oh and we have been greenlit on steam!Also there are plenty of awesome perks if you help me out. Like access to early builds of the game, T-shirts, and even a printed comic book with concept art in the back. Or if you are so inclined, we are offering a chance to get your name engraved on a tombstone in one of the maps, producer credits, or even a chance to design a playable Legend yourself! With the help of the October crew of course ;) Alright, so lets get down to the nitty gritty of what this game is about. Horror Legends is a 3 versus 1 multiplayer survival horror video game. To be released on the steam green light for the PC. (Possible MAC release TBT)Player will be able to choose 1 of 2 roles in the game. The first being part of a cast of character know as... well the Cast. They are our game's potential victims or heroes. Then there are the monster's and slashers that we call the Legends but I will get to those shortly. As part of the Cast you will have to search the environment for objectives or items to defend yourself with. Objectives are determined by the map your are playing on and the Legend that has been selected. Each Legend plays by it’s own set of rules, so in order for you to survive you will need to stay on your guard, you won't know what you are up against until its right in your face! Certain Legends might not be hurt by certain weapons and even if you kill them, some legends might not stay dead. So, make sure you save your ammo for when it counts; sometimes running is the best course of action. Remember you don't have to kill the Legend. If you complete the Map's objective you can escape and win the day. It's up to the Cast members to determine if they want to risk taking the Legend head on. Killing the Legend will win the round.So lets talk about monsters, or as we call them the Legends. Quite possibly the most alluring part of the game.  As the Legend you are the hunter. Utilize the unknown to your advantage. Cast
players wont know what Legend they are up against until they
encounter You for the first time. Certain rules of the encounter are determined by which legend you pick. In addition to the fact that each Legend will play completely differently from one another, some Legends can be gunned down while others will keep coming back until certain conditions are met. Some will kill, some will capture, and some will turn their prey into their minions. 
At
its core, Horror Legends is a video game that introduces a fun new
blend of horrific multiplayer experiences. It gives you the tools to thrill and chill your friends. Each player gets the opportunity to create a
variety of suspenseful multiplayer horror experiences. The
game requires for you to stay on your toes and use your survival
instinct to win. We have big plans for Horror Legends; but it would be unrealistic for us to promise everything we want to make at this point in development. So what we are planning on doing is dividing the game's content into Volumes. These Volumes will come at no extra cost to you or to anyone once they have purchased the game! We will however increase the price of the game as we create more content for it. So in a nut shell, the more we make for the game the more it will cost. We want to reward early adopters since it was you kind folk that are taking a chance on us. We feel this is a fair plan to cover the cost of future Volumes so we wont have to divide our player base with excessive DLC walls. We want everyone to have access to all the content (With the exception of our Patron Character William Punkie.) So based on how well Horror Legends does after release we can develop addition Volumes in the future.So Here is a break down of what you all are getting with Volume One's release of the game. Lets start with the Characters.
Now Lets look at the maps. For now The Farmhouse is the only one that is ready to show off. The Farmhouse Map

A large open map with a fully fleshed out corn maze and building interiors. The Cast have to find all the items to fix their car before the Legend kills them off.












Home Invasion Map (Under development) Available 10/2016


A smaller map where the Cast spawn inside of a nice summer home secluded in the woods. The Legends spawns outside and has to break in to kill the Cast member before the cops arrive. 

Graveyard Map (Under development) Available 01/2017


 A classic horror location that takes a lot of inspiration from horror films .

We will add more Characters and Maps in later Volumes depending how well the game does after release.

Ken Webster has enjoyed more than 20 years working as a composer and sound recordist in the Pacific NW.  Over the last 7 years, Ken has focused on Sound Design and Foley for Film and Commercials in addition to music scoring. The passion for sound design stems from his love of all things audio related, and making something new and never heard from the seemingly ordinary of every day sound.






We at Sinful Audio are excited to be providing music and sound design for Horror Legends.  Our goal is to help immerse you completely into the Horror Legends world and your character.  By taking a cinematic approach to the video game, we will provide you with an environment you’ll truly feel a part of.  We want you to feel that cold chill up and down your spine as you hear the cries of your friends, and…. what’s that?  Is that something behind you?


Imagine if you will, watching one of your favorite movies while muting the sound throughout the film.  Albeit the visuals may be stunning, the experience in and of itself would be less than satisfying.  No dialog, no sound effects, no music or atmosphere to carry the plot along.  How about your video games?  What would you think it would be like trying a FPS without audio references to guide you through the game, give you direction, or single out an opponent?  
The lack of audio, on its own, doesn’t necessarily drive the concept that audio is important to film or video games, but it gives us a great jumping off point.  I think we can all agree that without sound, one of the 5 senses that allow us to immerse ourselves both in our reality and fantasy worlds, we would be cognizant of something missing; our immersion that much duller and lacking.

Hey, Drake here,

One of the challenges that we are preparing for is managing a budget for the first time. Since 2012 we at October Games have been developing our projects based on our passion alone. Everything from Puppet Master: The Game, to the live events, the comic, and of course this game have all been created with no funding at all. Having a budget will come with some challenges, but that's to be expected. We are doing what we can to minimize any problems that may come up. The key thing to remember is that this will allow our key players to put in the time they need to get the job done. We have gotten this far with nothing, so think of what we can do with a little help from all you kind folk! 

I would have to say the biggest risk is on my end. I have already put so much of my own time, money, and energy into this project over the past few years, that quitting and going dark is unthinkable to me.  I believe in this project so much that I have kept developing it despite the fact that our Kickstarter from last year didn't reach its goal. This is truly one of my dream projects. I am telling you this to ensure you as potential backers that I will pull through and I will keep my word as I always have. This IndieGoGo campaign, if successful, will help minimize the risk of development. Also, I want you to know that I wont be taking any of the money for me personally. All of the money will be going to key October Games team members so that they can afford to spend the time to work on the game. 








Why was your Kickstarter from last year for 130,000 dollars and this one only 10,000 dollars?Answer: Well, the Idea was to have everyone on the team work full time for a year straight. A goal we didn't reach. Now things are much different. Since then I have been developing the game non stop in my spare time. There are only a few major pieces to complete before our October early access deadline. Doing this has decreased the cost of development drastically.Will this be coming to Xbox One or PS4?Answer: No plans at this point. Right now we are just focusing on a PC and a possible MAC release. We will have to wait and see where things go after we finish Volume One.I see you selected Flexible Funding. What happens if you don't reach your goal?Answer: Like I mentioned in the Risks and Challenges section. This is a passion project of mine. We have been developing this game with no funding for 2 years, and I have no plans of cancelling the game. At this point any amount of money is going to expedite our development for sure. So the more money we can raise the more time we have to develop the game. If  we don't make our goal we will still push forward but our release dates might change depending on how much money we can raise.How are you releasing the Early Access builds of the game? It's not through Steam Early Access is it?Answer: Nope, we will send you an email with a download link! So only you backers will be able to play the early versions of the game! 


Will this support Controllers?
Answer: Yes! It will support both mouse/ keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller! 
Why is it 3 versus 1 and not more like 8 versus 1!?
Answer: I get this a lot. Well through prototyping we found that anything above 4 wasn't as scary. You felt safe surrounded by the other players. Three seemed to be the magic number.  This isn't to say we wont have a new game mode in the future that can suppot more players. We will have to wait and see.

The creative and talented team at EQUUS 101 have spent the last nearly four years creating this REVOLUTIONARY new solo or social game.  Now it's ready to GO LIVE.  With your help.
NEVER has a game existed like it before.  No wonder it's called an Adventure game with such global talent in it.  Artists, Experts and Celebrities galore - hilarious, fun and a great adventure is only a lid pop away.  GAME on!
AND it even has it's own song - created by non-other than the 2013 International Songwriter of the Year winner, Tony King!  ROCK on!
It's got romance, mystery , mayhem and magnificent images.
Play it outside or inside - anywhere, anytime is HorsePLAY time.



 It took a year longer than planned because ""our illustrator is a perfectionist and a pain in the butt!""  (Do you believe this is what Lesley made me write for the introduction!)It will sell for $59.95 RRP.  The recommended pricing because of its quality and design brilliance was $75-$82.  But we want it to be a game enjoyed by many, so we selected a lower price point.Have a look at some of the Adventure cards.  If you get the card right you keep it.  The player with the most points wins.  Chance, luck, the roll of the dice and a good guess all play parts in who gets to be the Champion at the end of game time.ADVENTURE cards = 1 pointGALLERY cards = 10 points
CROSSROADS cards = 5 points
 
Hmm - guess which illustrator has a mischievous sense of humour!
(Hint:  Her first name is Lesley)
CROSSROADS cards = 5 points (they're purple, in the headings)  BUSKING cards = 1 point + some bonuses!   REVOLUTIONARY in what way?

It’s DESIGN and QUALITY.  
Quality of production AND content quality.                     
NEVER EVER before has global talent partnered together in a game product like this before.  (Mega Artists, Experts, Celebrities and Bucket List worthy locations have a great time here).  ***This is BIG – a WORLD first………..is that singing from the roof tops I hear?
If we listed all the AWESOME talent harnessed together here the list would run for pages.  But up the top in the ARTISTS list would include greats such as Tim Flach, Robert Vavra, Bill Ray, Lesley Bruce, Bob Langrish, Christiane Slawik, Picasso, Sir Alfred Munnings, Tony King and Nina Vox, Rebecca Campbell, Katharine Hepburn, Katy Driver, Fiona Lake, Nicole Emmanuel, Paul Boromeo, Shelley Watson, Steve Panozzo, Ross Pulsford, Dale Durfee, Carol Heuchan, Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Miller, Stubbs, Landeer, Renoir, Rubens, Sorolla, James Seymour, Francis Reiss, Jeff Carter, Bruce Howard, Harold Cazneaux, Franz Marc, Darren Pateman, Darren Stones, Sidney Nolan, Monet, Arthur Boyd, Steve Bloom and William Shakespeare....to name but a few.
In the EXPERTS list you'd find inspiring people such as Nigel Carren, Albert Einstein, The Wright Brothers, Dr Robert Miller, John Whitaker,Sue-Ellen Lovett, Merv Hughes, Javed Miandad, Sir Donald Bradman, Lorenzo, Alycia Burton, Brenton Matthews, Allison Crompton, Dr Andrew McLean, Adam Sutton, the Crack Up Sisters, Pat Parelli, Monty Roberts, Muhammad Ali, Tim O'Brien, Tschiffely, Yannick Bru, Mark Todd, Michelle Dennis, Guy McLean, Boyd Martin, Stuart Tinney, Anky van Grunsven, Charlotte Allison-Bruce, Charlie Brister, Paul Cave, Paul Newman and Jackie Kennedy to name but a few and in no particular order.
It is like a board game but WITHOUT a board.  This changes the dynamic big time because now it’s much more portable and screams “take me with you."" 

 SERIOUS hours of research and strategic design has gone into this product.  HorsePLAY has been designed to cater for the various ways people like to be entertained.  Ensuring there is something in it for everyone.

The GAME BOX is not cardboard which goes furry when added to water.  Or tin which looks like it’s having a serious fashion crisis after a few unflattering dints falling from a bench or two.  It’s……………..smooth, elegant, robust and plastic.
And…….and…….and..(look at the video and gallery images to get a peek at the impressive qualities contained in this elegant blue adventure box).

So good is this game you DON’T EVEN HAVE TO PLAY IT!  The feast for your eyes of engaging images will have you reach for the tissues in one hand and helping hold back the belly laughs with the other. 


  WHY HorsePLAY?Isn’t it a great name!  The name is actually a play on words about what horses do naturally every day.  Having some horse play is really all about healthy frivolous fun on their own (solo), or with a herd buddy (social).  It’s what horses do every day.  They’ve been doing it for 55 million years.  And NOW - so can we!Each of the PLAY graphics helps you see what fun stuff you get to do when hav'n some HorsePLAY: 
P = Perform (mime, act out…)
L = Let out your artistic talents (draw, write)
A = Around the world via the images in HorsePLAY you can go.  
        No passport required!
Y = YES, definitely behave like no ones watching!
Now so can we!                                   Is it primarily a game for Horsy People?Ha ha.  ‘Horsy’ people don’t have the monopoly on frivolous fun and hors’n around.  It’s exciting fun for EVERYone.Watch the other videos to get an idea of who would enjoy some HorsePLAY.There’s John Hurt’s brilliant voice talking up this REVOLUTIONARY new game.Even the not to be messed with voice of Jason Statham shares why he’s enjoyed this Adventure ride so much.And WHO knew the Doctor had already discovered HorsePLAY - the ride of your life game EVEN before it went up on this campaign.  Ah, but he can see the future can’t he!None of the RAH, YIPPEE, its BRILLIANT stuff they say surprises us.HorsePLAY has been strategically designed so no matter how smart you are or how clever you aren’t everyone has the chance to be the Champion (the winner).  Chance, luck of the dice, luck of a good guess and the ability to behave like no one’s watching all come into who wins.     For the young, older, in-between or in-DENIAL, HorsePLAY’s got something in it for everyone.  EQUUS 101 is based in Sydney, Australia.  It specializes in making entertaining products.  Think lasting learning that entertains your brain.  In this case it’s a game + a book.The ‘101’ is because we don’t like to aim for 100%.  And no matter which way you write it, back to front or front to back, 101 is always 101. We’re solid in what we do and the Team we do it with.Our Team is spread far and wide.  Some are in France, others America andEngland, one is currently holidaying in Brazil. Most are in Australia.  Some arefull time, others part time, others who have separate careers and no time still contribute enormously as part of what we call our ‘Executive Team'.  From around the world their talents flow – right into the HorsePLAY game box where you can soon go.  To blow our own trumpet on how awesome Team EQUUS is guess who was recently awarded the International Songwriter of the Year for Best Lyrics?  Judges included Tom Waits and Bernie Taupin.  Drum roll…our very own Tony King.  And which great mum just had both daughters kick of their bike’s training wheels in the same week!  Our very own Finola.  And which Team member had the close encounter with the ground to help remind them we don’t bounce so well when we’re 60 something.  That would be Lesley, our artistic guru.HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS AWESOME SONG - it's in the Gallery.Jacqueline our Team leader has the illustrious title of being the only Australian to have ever been granted a license by Discovery Communications Inc. (USA), think Discovery Channel, to put their brand on a previous game product.Discovery QUEST was a more traditional board game design – albeit with some extra special quirks and fun bits.  It sold successfully around the world and iscurrently being relicensed.  At the premium end of the game market Discovery QUEST sold for $85 AUD.The EQUUS Team are not new kids on the block in this making a game space.  Rest assured all the previous lessons learned (the good, the bad and the ugly) have gone into making HorsePLAY the REVOLUTIONARY game that it is. Even a REVOLUTIONARY game like HorsePLAY needs to plan ahead to keep its customers full ‘entertainment’ range satisfied.  So here’s our plan of EVOLUTION:
First comes HorsePLAY the game in its sexy robust “take me with you” game box.  

Then the Monty the Monster fantasy fiction book (Trilogy) which brings the characters illustrated on the game cards to life.  In all the glory of their extremely colorful rainbow.  

Next is HorsePLAY video game.
Then voila……..the HorsePLAY App.  No excuses now for not setting your real horseplay spirit free and discovering how much horsepower you really have. 

                                OUR GOAL - $47,500   (5,000 units, Nov 2014 – Game Launch)This will enable a small production run of 5,000 units to be made. Such a small volume WILL NOT ALLOW supply to outside Australia EXCEPT tothose lucky international people who pre-order via this IndieGoGo campaign.It doesn’t provide any extra to go into the marketing kitty for launch events (November 2014) and the additional staffing costs.  These have to be provided for out of pre-orders from retail stores.  (Which we’ve got great interest from – but more funding means more staff.  More staff mean more sales, better economies of scale in production since we can then order more units.)Monty Book progesses but only as a distant relative to the full focus of GAME on!  We are mindful of the ideal timing in release of each of the books in the Monty the Monster trilogy.  Ideally each book is ready for release within a month of each other.  Longer delays between releases increases the marketing costs signifcantly.   At this goal no additional focus can be given to Book 2 and 3 beyond the work already completed.1stSTRETCH GOAL - $92,450 (15,000 units, Nov 2014 – Game Launch)This is where the game starts to walk faster.
We can afford to keep our Marketing Manager Mikaela full time from now until well into next year. 

We can afford to engage a Fulfilment company to do the distribution and not have to spend hours providing such a service which is not EQUUS’s core business.
We can supply our overseas network of Agents and retailers with game samples.  And proceed to take orders accordingly.

Monty Book still progressing, albeit slowly.  Focus still - GAME on!  This goal does not provide the financial support for greater progress on Book 2 and 3.2nd STRETCH GOAL - $135,000 (Begin supply to USA, UK, NZ, Asia Pacific)This is where the game is jogging along nicely.We can afford the additional staff member and associated costs that go with being able to supply more product to more retailers/agents and customers.  andMonty the Monster Book 1 gets enough attention to finish it and start production.  The sooner Book 1 is finished the sooner Book 2 get finished…..and so on.  (3 books @ $19.95 is current suggestion for market positioning).3rd  - THE BIG KAHUNA STRETCH GOAL - $182,581  RECORD BREAKERNot only does this break the Australian IndieGoGo Campaign record set last year but it would also allow for:
the video game version of HorsePLAY game to be finished).
the hilarious HorsePLAY app to get finished.
increased staff, increased sales and a quicker grasp on HorsePLAY taking its position as a game like no other.  It’s already being spoken of as a “Must Have” game.  Randomly we continue to get the comment from people in the test plays “it’s the kind of game that’s so much fun, yet so easy to play, you wonder what we did without it?”

 We have loads of great rewards for our supporters.  We make sure we get them to you with all the TLC we can muster – even including a GOLD STAR!ALL of these rewards are unique to this HorsePLAY GO LIVE IndieGoGocampaign.These rewards will not be offered like this again. Each Limited Edition certificate has a number on it.  From 1 to how ever many backers we get.  No one else can ever get that certificate let alone get it with that number on it.Imagine if you’re the 101st to back that Perk?  We’ll have to do something extra special for those people.Now by ‘never be offered like this again’ please believe that to be true.Market research specialists positioned HorsePLAY in the $80-$95 RRP bracket.  We decided we’d rather have more people enjoy it than that price allows.  Hence we priced it at nearly HALF the recommended retail price for such quality and design.To now be offering HorsePLAY at a special campaign price of $35 which is 40% less (than the $59.95 RRP) isn’t something we expect to see happen EVER again.So congrats on finding your way here. Enjoy it.  This is a special occassion.Once the campaign starts, we will begin the Limited Edition Certificate perks right away. We’ll do an update each week PLUS special updates when particular milestones have been reached.  Like the 101st person to pledge – what a brilliant number that will be on their Certificate.Imagine if J K Rowling had done such numbered certificates if she’d looked to self-publish Harry Potter.  What would those certificates be worth now!Extra cool will be 1001, 10001, and 100,001 certificates.Game ON!  Let’s aim to have your certificates evolve to be a highly prized auction item at Christies. Contributing is wonderful (thank you) but if you can’t do that right now we appreciate that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Here’s some things we’d looooove people to help with:
Pass the word around, help make some noise about the Billy Connolly talking horse.  Let people know about this AWESOME game that’s so brilliant you don’t even have to play! 
Use the share tools to help spread the word. Contact your local game store – ask them have they got their order in yet?

<h3>TLDR Summary:</h3> <p>Hosting all of those mods for Torchlight 1 and 2 and containing the huge database of users costs a significant amount of money every month. Lately the money from advertisements and contributors hasn't been enough, to the point that we'll run out of funding in two months at this rate. To determine whether or not the website survives or will be shut down, I'm trying to get enough funding to hold out for a year.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The cost of hosting the website on a capable server and dishing out the bandwidth for all of those mods is currently about 70 dollars a month. Over the past few months traffic has decreased to the point that the money from advertising and people contributing just isn't enough, and right now I estimate about two months worth of funds before there isn't enough money left to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Here are the goals and what they unlock:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>700 Dollars - This is my estimate of what I would need to pay for a year of server hosting with the supplemental advertising money on the side cover the remainder of the costs. This is the base goal. (including bank, Paypal, and IndieGogo transaction fees) </li>
<li>924 Dollars - This would cover an entire year's worth of server hosting (including bank, Paypal, and IndieGogo transaction fees). Reaching this goal would mean no Advertisements on the site for registered members for an entire year. An additional round of fundraising would occur at the end of that year.</li>
<li>1200 Dollars - All server fees covered, as well as most software renewals/upgrades and covering the cost of using Dropbox to keep manual backups on hand. Reaching this goal would mean a significant site upgrade (visual and functional) within the next year. <b>Updated: </b>If we reach this goal the entire site will be ad-free for everyone for a year AND everyone who contributes above 5 dollars will receive a lifetime of ad-free RGF, even if ads come back for other people!</li>
</ul>
<div>
<strike>If we don't reach the initial goal, then the money will still go to paying server costs, but when it runs out if there isn't enough money from advertising or contributions coming in then the site will shut down at that time. Hopefully even if we don't reach the goal then the Mac version of Torchlight 2 will come out, or Runic will have another game announced, or even Grim Dawn (for which I host Grim Dawn Mods, another fansite on the same server sharing the costs) could reach the point of mod support and could bring in revenue. In the end, the goal is to have enough money to make it to a point where the site can stay afloat again. </strike>We reached the goal, so this part isn't important anymore! :D</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>There are a few perks available, some which can be tracked via the sidebar. Currently these include:</p>
<p><b>Update: If we reach the 1200 goal ANYONE who contributes 5 dollars or more to the campaign will be ad-free on RGF for the life of the site!</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>5 Dollars</b> - As with the previous contribution system if you pay 5 dollars you will receive one month without advertisements whenever you are logged in to your account. If we don't reach our goal and the site does go down this will give you plenty of time to download and stockpile as many mods as you want without advertisements getting in your way.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>70 Dollars</b> - Any person who covers an entire month's server fees will receive an Advertisement-free experience for this site and any others that I host for all time. If the site still gets shut down, I will personally supply a dropbox link to the donator to a folder that contains every mod file that was contained on the site.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Highest Bidders!</b> - The two people who contribute the most to the campaign will receive EXTREMELY rare mini statues of Torchlight 2's Dark Alchemist, courtesy of the people at Runic Games. At least one of the donations needs to be via the 25 Dollar Perk, so as to include your address, but the final result will be cumulative for all donations. The page will be updated with the latest Top Two amounts regularly, so check back to see if you are in the running!<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/892946/files/20140930074539-IndieGogoDarkAlchemistStatue.jpg?1412088339"" src="""" style=""width: 256.594059405941px; height: 341px;""/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When Torchlight 1 was released there were three main mod sites for it, but as time passed RGF (Runic Games Fansite) became the only one remaining, and thus became the sole concentrated source of Torchlight mods. The mods helped the site stay paid for and everyone stayed happy, and we built a nice community and a cool Mod Manager.</p>
<p>When Torchlight 2 came out Steam became an alternate source of mods for people playing the Steam version of the game, which meant we lost the monopoly on mods and thus a lot of the traffic. However, there are still many people who own the non-Steam version of Torchlight 2, and still play Torchlight 1, and thus RGF is their only source for mods. If the site goes down it will kill a huge part of the game for many people.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make Steam out to be the bad guy here, as I use Steam for most of my games these days, but the truth is with the implementation of traditionally community-supported functionality (such as mod hosting and installation) into Steam it kills off community-based sites where modders can congregate, share information, help each other, and collaborate on projects. In other words, the convenience of the big name companies taking over modding undercuts the number and quality of mods you get in the end. I'm trying to keep this little portion of the web that so many people have contributed to alive.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>You don't know me. I am just a guy with a day job who has been running a fansite as a hobby since 2008. When the site started it was before the economy got really bad, advertisers were paying better and forums were still a bigger part of the web than they are now. I've tried to keep these sites paid for over the years without a bunch of highly intrusive advertisements, mandatory registrations, or any of the other now common signs of a monetized website. Maybe that is why I'm in this mess now.</p>
<p>There is a risk giving money to any person or website that isn't a big name, well known company, but in a sense that is why we're in this mess now. Help the underdog.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you don't have the means to help monetarily, there are still a couple things you can do. Spread the word of the campaign to your friends and family. If you have mods you've hosted on steam, try adding them to RGF as well. It's a quick registration and upload away, and every mod we get will help the non-Steam users of Torchlight 2 as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have some artistic skills and would like to help make some perks or stretch goals, contact me at webbstre@runicgamesfansite.com and we'll try to work something out.</p>
<p>Please do not contact me offering to host the site on your server. I am not willing to trust the security of the people visiting the site to someone I don't know, and that is essentially what would happen if the site was in someone else's hands.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Final Note:</h3>
<p>A year ago I became a father. A lot of my waking time has gone into helping out at home, but that hasn't stopped me from monitoring the site, trying to help out the odd person who comes by and asks a question, or even moving the site onto a cheaper (and less annoying) webhost. I've been trying, but the main reason I've been able to keep going with the site is because between the people contributing to the monthly costs and the supplemental advertising money the site has financially taken care of itself. I want that to continue, but if it turns out the time of the lowly individual fansite is over, then I'll let it go and spend some more time with my family and my other personal projects.</p>

</div></div>","RunAround is an endless running game in low poly, with minimal textures and cartoon artstyle.It was born by the idea of making a simple videogame based on the tipology of endless running games, easy, for everyone and you can relax playing with it. It's basically a character that as first walks around the world, you have to avoid obstacles like cactus, trees and buildings that spawn randomly on the surface of the planet, then this become more difficult as long as you walk around the world because the character speed up and become bigger. You can find perks like ""double-point"", ""ghost"" and ""magnet"" to pick up that helps you. The terrain and the ambient mutate everytime you do a full run-around the world and you can go everywhere you want, you're not forced on pre-enstablished routes but you can do an ""U"" turn or, for example, go full right if you want, the possibilities are infinite.







POINTS: PERKS AND COINS.


More you run-around more points you gain.  Pick up coins to become smaller and earn extra points.  
Perks available:

<p>Khordz designer, Daniel Fontius, loves coffee. He also loves the ocean. Unfortunately, his love for coffee and coffee shops was having a negative impact on the ocean. He sometimes finds himself at one, two, or even three different coffee shops a day. He has always felt guilty about the number of single-use cups and lids he has consumed in his life, since he picked up the habit at the age of 10.</p>
<p>In July of 2013, Daniel and his partner Krista Harris, were presented with a challenge... to cut out as much single-use plastic as possible from their lives for one month. At the top of the list of worst pollution offenders was Daniel's favorite, the to-go coffee cup lid… bummer! So, they decided to commit to the challenge. In order to do this, they started toting their favorite to-go mugs that Daniel had fashioned the year before out of some leftover venetian blind cord and empty honey jars. (At the time Daniel was really into tying knots, having just returned from a sailing excursion in the Caribbean.) As it turned out, the leftover blind cord was the perfect length for making a hand-wrapped sleeve and handle. The design has been a huge hit (having now gone through several prototypes). Daniel and Krista constantly receive comments and requests from friends and strangers. Thus, Khordz was born!</p><h4>Handmade Mugs That Make a Difference</h4><p>The goal of Khordz is to get others excited about keeping plastic out of the landfill, off the beach, and out of the ocean. We aim to help support those that make it their mission to protect the ocean and ensure that everyone can enjoy the beauty and resources it offers. </p><p>Khordz mugs are also a handy companion for the adventurer and outdoor enthusiast. You can do a lot with a jar and 25 ft. of paracord. Some of our favorites are the handy snare trap, hanging your hammock, tying up hyper siblings, suspending your bear canister from a tree, clothes lines, and the fire starter bow! Stay tuned... we will be adding videos that highlight the many uses of Khordz mugs! </p><h4>Mission Statement</h4><p>We’re Khordz. We live simple and sustainable lifestyles that keep us in touch with our roots right here in coastal California. We take care in producing individual, hand crafted, multi-purposed drinkware that allows us to stay connected through what some may consider unexpected means. We don’t always know where we’re going, but we know what we need to take with us. We keep our products close to our hearts, crafted with the individual and the environment in mind.</p><h2>Challenges</h2><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p>We are aware of the various challenges involved in bringing a product to market.</p><p>Our first challenge will be getting the word out and meeting our funding goal. We have a plan to engage all of our professional and social networks... this includes you! We hope you will be excited and want to help spread the word through your own networks as well. We'll also be posting updates and entertaining videos to engage new backers and supporters.</p><p>The second possible challenge will hopefully be that Khordz is a huge success!! While this would be awesome, we also know it will take a lot of work to meet demand. This is the kind of challenge we like!

</div></div>","Hi everyone. We’re Laia and Ian, founders of Sukubus Studio
 We’re delighted to show you the third miniatures range we’ve developed 
on 3D for our studio. Thanks to this platform we are glad to show you 
our creations and would like to know your thoughts. We hope you 
like them as much as we’ve enjoyed developing.Witches Team is made up by a group of dark elves warriors. 
In it there are diverse kinds of Witches that represent the diverse 
roles in a Fantasy Football match.The idea came to us when Valkyries Team
 campaign finished. The feedback from backers was amazing during Sukubus Team and Valkyries Team. Thanks for
 their support, encourage us to continue producing Fantasy Football 
Teams. For this occasion we decided to do something different again, and
 continue to offer alternative quality miniatures.



Production will be made in high quality resin on a 32 mm scale. We’re certain of the finishing of each miniature, as they will be made by our friends at  RN Estudio, great professionals that have a lot of experience in this kind of campaigns.













This counter is an exclusive gift for this campaign. Each backer will receive only one counter per package or one per each complete team in case that you order more than one.


We want to offer the best quality for our backers. That's why we have managed to make the production of Witches Dices with Chessex. A great customized dices company that get the best results.

<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">'<em>Game Over, Man. Game Over!</em>'</h2>
<p>The campaign has finally come to an end.</p>
<p>But the game is <strong>far</strong> from over. In fact, it has only just begun!</p>
<p>A lot of wonderful people donated a total of 1368$. This will help cover some expenses during the first year of development.</p>
<p>The two most important things we gained from this campaign, is the licenses for the game engine (Thanks Rob) and you, all of our fans.</p>
<p><strong>Next stop:</strong> Early alpha game…<br/><strong>Time to destination:</strong> Hopefully within a years time.</p>
<p>Follow our progress by checking our webpage <a href=""http://www.theuniverse4x.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theuniverse4x.com</a> and liking us on facebook <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/theuniverse4xgame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/theuniverse4xgame</a>.</p>
<p>We will primarily use the facebook page to issue updates, untill the website has been properly built.</p>
</div>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">The Final 24 Hours</h2>
<p>While it does not look like we will make the goal, this campaign has been invaluable in the experience we have gained from our budding community.<br/> We are happy about all the donations and they will help us immensely during these first baby-steps of the game.</p>
<p>One of our primary goals with this fundraising wasn’t really about the money.<br/> We wanted to ‘kickstart’ a community for the game. More and more people are ‘liking’ us on facebook, allowing them to follow our continued progress.</p>
<p>The past couple of weeks have all been about spreading the word, but soon the campaign is over and we can shift focus to more planning and building the ever-important first Alfa game, which will eventually lead us to the even more important Beta.</p>
<p>What really surprised us at the beginning of the campaign, was the donation of the licenses for the game engine we intend to use (<em>414$ value</em>). This allowed us to start development/programming, <em>regardless</em> of the amount of donations that followed.<br/> Once again, <strong>thank you</strong> Rob Evans from Irrelon Software!</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">March 29th, 2012: Important update</h2>
<p>We've been in contact with <strong>Rob Evans</strong> at <strong>Irrelon Software</strong>, who created the <strong>Isogenic Engine</strong>, which we intend to use for the game.</p>
<p>They decided to <strong>donate the engine license</strong> as well as <strong>two developer licenses</strong> toward our game!</p>
<p>As a result, we've altered the funding calculation, so the 414$ for the license is now part of the funds destined for graphic artists and sounds.</p>
<p><strong>This means that we can begin programming even before this campaign ends!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you <a href=""http://www.isogenicengine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rob and Irrelon software</a></p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">Introductions</h2>
<div>
<div>Peter is 34 years old and lives with his girlfriend somewhere in Central Copenhagen in Denmark.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jon is 29 years old, lives with his girlfriend and baby daughter somewhere in the Greater Copenhagen Area in Denmark.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A bunch of years ago, Peter and Jon were both studying to be Data Technicians. It was a 5-year education which focused on Cisco networks and a general, broad knowledge of different IT technologies, as well as programming. This is where they met and sweet music happened. Well, no music. But they did become friends.</div>
<div>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">How the idea started</h2>
</div>
<div>Peter and Jon both have been doing a lot of gaming throughout their lives. Over the past couple of years Peter has been thinking more and more about the gameplay and their individual restrictions. One night, <em>not very long ago</em>, he started putting together a concept for a new game uniting many of the gaming concepts he liked from the other games. He presented the (<em>very</em>) raw concept to Jon and he was hooked too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After months of <strong>thinking</strong>, <em>writing</em>, scheming, <strong>drinking</strong>, <em>eating</em> and whatnot, they ended up with a well defined concept for this new <strong>amazing</strong> game.</div>
</div>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">The Game</h2>
<div>Basically it is a <strong>4X</strong> game. <strong>4X</strong> is an acronym for<strong> e<em>X</em>plore, e<em>X</em>pand, e<em>X</em>ploit and e<em>X</em>terminate</strong>. Most will know these games as Strategy games. Unlike most other <strong>4X</strong> games (<em>e.g. Civilization, Galactic Civilizations, Master of Orion and Sins of a Solar Empire</em>) this game will be <strong>Massively-Multiplayer</strong> oriented and set in a <strong>persistent</strong> world.</div>
<div>It focuses on <strong>construction</strong>, <strong>economy</strong>, <strong>diplomacy</strong>, <strong>research</strong>, <strong>cooperation</strong> and <strong>trade</strong>; but <strong>warfare</strong> and <em>other naughty gameplay</em> will also be implemented.</div>
<div>It will mostly resemble a mixture between <strong>SimCity</strong> and <strong>Civilization</strong>, but different and much more intertwined in the persistent world. Your village only has two limits:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Available land</li>
<li>Money</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Eventually your ""<em>village</em>"" could encompass an entire planet and your empire half a galaxy, but most likely not without aid.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Friends are not required</h3>
<div>
<div>This game is intended to be playable as a <strong>casual browser game</strong>, similar to <strong>CastleVille, GalaxyLife, AirportCity</strong>.</div>
One of the differences from those browser games, is that you are not required to have or help friends in order to obtain some special item which (<em>in the other games</em>) would be required to complete a tutorial or mission.</div>
<div>
<strong>You will not be forced</strong> to add your friends. That is a trend with many popular browser games, which we will not indulge.</div>
<div>We may add a sort of bonus for inviting friends, but <strong>none of that </strong>""<em>promote us on facebook by sending your friends resources</em>"", which ends up spamming their facebook-wall.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>That being said</strong>, you can still benefit from having friends near you in the game, as they are more inclined to accept cheaper trade deals, because they trust you to do the same.</div>
<div>It makes it easier to teach each other technologies (<em>for a price of course</em>) to enable quicker improvements to your community as a whole.</div>
<div>You can make a municipality from the beginning and have someone you all trust run the eco-political game, creating better trade deals for you all to benefit from, so <em>you</em> don't have to do the legwork of securing trade deals.</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Money CAN buy happiness</h3>
<div>
<div>Despite the topic, the game will be<strong> completely free to play</strong>.</div>
<div>Using <strong>only</strong> your <strong>ingame funds </strong>(<em>no real money needed</em>), you can purchase your way through the game, instead of researching.</div>
</div>
<p>Economy, as well as trade, is an integral part of this game and you can always purchase whatever you need to get ahead.</p>
<div>To be able <strong>to buy something you need</strong>, another Player <strong>must have produced</strong> and put that something <strong>for sale</strong> first (<em>ingame funds only</em>).</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>This enables an entirely Player-driven market where Players set the price and <em>supply and demand</em> has a very real impact on your income.</li>
<li>Make the best product in your general area, and you decide the price, at least untill someone else makes a better product or sell a slightly inferior product at low, low prices.</li>
<li>As trade routes and interactions grow, so does the range and knowledge of your products. You may end up getting orders for your special goods from further away than you knew existed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Stockpiling and wearing down</h3>
<p>Just because you can produce something in large volumes, doesn't mean you should produce a lot of goods and stockpile them for better times. <strong>All goods are perishable</strong> to a degree and have a limited lifespan after production (<em>some are long, though</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>This includes vehicles, buildings, food, power lines, roads and basically all goods.</li>
<li>Better storage/production methods can improve or even suspend their lifespan, but eventually things will wear out.</li>
<li>Upgrading anything with better materials or production methods will increase their lifespan. As lifespan nears the end, the quality and function/speed of the building/vehicle is reduced; and eventually ceases to function.
<ul>
<li>Bad news if you are in a spaceship in between planets. But hey, at least your communication equipment is still working, so you can call for help. 
<ul>
<li>You did remember to replace that old radio, didn't you?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As a consequence of wearing out, <strong>an entire village can wear down</strong> if it is not attended to by a player. We aim to implement a simple upkeep to handle the village repairs and required materials can be automatically purchased to facilitate this repair. <em>But here you can also save some money by micromanaging the purchase of materials.</em>
<ul>
<li>Eventually a player decides to leave the game as-is and never to return. This will leave weathered and abandoned villages for other players to pick apart for resources or unknown technologies; or to restore, as they see fit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A time limit will be determined for how long a player can stay (<em>completely</em>) out of the game, before upkeep payments are suspended and owners rights are lost. Maybe 1 or 2 months. We are not sure yet, but it will be a fair limit. <br/><ul>
<li>People should be able to go on extended vacation without attending to their village. They will miss out on big trade deals or have someone else build resource gathering equipment on their turf while they are on vacation, but at least they will not lose their village.</li>
<li>If owners rights are lost, other players can claim the village (<em>and lands</em>) as theirs. The original player is of course also able to reclaim the village after the time limit, as long as it is unclaimed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Politics, alliances and communities</h3>
<p>Production and trade will be a big part of the game, as they drive the economics, but at some point, you may tire from constant production and wish to learn more about the politics of the region you inhabit.</p>
<p>If you are part of a Municipality, you can contact your Mayor (<em>a player democratically elected</em>), or other leading character (<em>a selfproclaimed dictator perhaps?</em>) and let him know you are interested in joining politics to allow him to make the introduction to other leading characters in the (<em>geo-</em>)political circles/players currently active.</p>
<p>But you can also just introduce yourself, if e.g. you intended to run for Mayor yourself, or just wish to learn more about what is going on. Do note that the Mayor may have access to political discussions you don't, so going through him may help you get into the inner political circle faster.</p>
<p>Help build alliances for your community, help mediate warring (<em>internal?</em>) parties to enable peace and trade, or help covert operations to gain information about your enemies.</p>
<p>You do not have to involve yourself with the community at large, but the political opportunities and power are there for whoever grabs them first.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Research and Technology</h3>
<p>Advancing in the game <strong>does not require</strong> you to do massive amounts of research, <em>although it certainly helps</em>. Research being mostly optional is also what makes this game differ from all the other 4X games. You have the option of purchasing technology from other Players, or simply buying the weapons, goods or services (<em>e.g. competent workforce</em>) you need, regardless whether your own technological level is high enough to create it yourself. All you need is (<em>ingame</em>) <strong>money</strong>!</p>
<p>The technology tree will be large and intricate, and we do really mean <strong>large</strong> and <strong>intricate</strong>. Researching technologies does not just happen over night.</p>
<p>Basically it should not be feasible for a single player to research the entire technology tree alone, at least not without spending a large amount of time playing the game.</p>
<p>The reasonning behind this is to enable (<em>or rather force</em>) Players to create product niches where they produce a superior product that, e.g., other Players require to construct weapons, which they sell to other Players, who use them to conquer and subdue unsuspecting Players.</p>
<p>Some might call this<em> Specialization</em> and <em>cruel</em>. We call it <em>fun</em> and believe it will make the game <em>interesting</em>, because not everyone has the same (<em>technological</em>) advantages. The game will be dynamic and new players in populated areas will probably be asked/paid <em>(or forced</em>) to produce food and other general resources needed by your thriving city (<em>state</em>).</p>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Micropayments</h3>
<p>We have played our fair share of browser games which block some advancements or actions, untill you pay. And <strong>we don't like that</strong> any more than you do!</p>
<p>At some point, micropayments will be enabled, but <strong>the game will not require any payment</strong> to play to <strong>its fullest extent</strong>.</p>
<p>Implementing micropayments <strong>will not limit the free players or the game experience</strong>.</p>
<div>Micropayments will only be intended to give ingame cash advantages:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Pay extra cash as an incentive to workers, so they work longer hours and finish faster, <em>but they <strong>cannot</strong> complete production in an instant</em>.</li>
<li>Hire extra workers to help speed production along, just make sure your production facility has space for them to work in.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Playing the game</h3>
<div>Playing the game should be <strong>as easy as possible</strong> for those players who just wants to play casually, but <em>there will be options</em> to delve into the <strong>micromanagement hell</strong> that lies frothing beneath the surface. Micromanaging can result in better products, faster research, cheaper expenses in production and many other benefits. Or micromanaging can cost you precious time that could have been better spent on expanding your knowledge of the territory (<em>available resources</em>) and gaining access to Players (<em>friends/enemies/business partners</em>) to peddle your products to, or spy on for future wars.</div>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">The Platform</h2>
<div>Well, that sure sounds like a complex game. The big question is, will we release it for <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong> or <strong>OSX</strong>?</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>The short answer is: For <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>HTML5</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Those two technologies should be able to run on basically <strong>any platform</strong> with an Internet Browser:<strong> Windows, OSX, Linux, Unix, Sun, Android, iPhone,</strong> and so on, and so forth.</div>
</div>

The campaign has finally come to an end.
But the game is far from over. In fact, it has only just begun!
A lot of wonderful people donated a total of 1368$. This will help cover some expenses during the first year of development.
The two most important things we gained from this campaign, is the licenses for the game engine (Thanks Rob) and you, all of our fans.
Next stop: Early alpha game…Time to destination: Hopefully within a years time.
Follow our progress by checking our webpage www.theuniverse4x.com and liking us on facebook www.facebook.com/theuniverse4xgame.
We will primarily use the facebook page to issue updates, untill the website has been properly built.

The Final 24 Hours
While it does not look like we will make the goal, this campaign has been invaluable in the experience we have gained from our budding community. We are happy about all the donations and they will help us immensely during these first baby-steps of the game.
One of our primary goals with this fundraising wasn’t really about the money. We wanted to ‘kickstart’ a community for the game. More and more people are ‘liking’ us on facebook, allowing them to follow our continued progress.
The past couple of weeks have all been about spreading the word, but soon the campaign is over and we can shift focus to more planning and building the ever-important first Alfa game, which will eventually lead us to the even more important Beta.
What really surprised us at the beginning of the campaign, was the donation of the licenses for the game engine we intend to use (414$ value). This allowed us to start development/programming, regardless of the amount of donations that followed. Once again, thank you Rob Evans from Irrelon Software!
March 29th, 2012: Important update
We've been in contact with Rob Evans at Irrelon Software, who created the Isogenic Engine, which we intend to use for the game.
They decided to donate the engine license as well as two developer licenses toward our game!
As a result, we've altered the funding calculation, so the 414$ for the license is now part of the funds destined for graphic artists and sounds.
This means that we can begin programming even before this campaign ends!
Thank you Rob and Irrelon software
-------------------------
Introductions

Peter is 34 years old and lives with his girlfriend somewhere in Central Copenhagen in Denmark.
 
Jon is 29 years old, lives with his girlfriend and baby daughter somewhere in the Greater Copenhagen Area in Denmark.
 
A bunch of years ago, Peter and Jon were both studying to be Data Technicians. It was a 5-year education which focused on Cisco networks and a general, broad knowledge of different IT technologies, as well as programming. This is where they met and sweet music happened. Well, no music. But they did become friends.

How the idea started

Peter and Jon both have been doing a lot of gaming throughout their lives. Over the past couple of years Peter has been thinking more and more about the gameplay and their individual restrictions. One night, not very long ago, he started putting together a concept for a new game uniting many of the gaming concepts he liked from the other games. He presented the (very) raw concept to Jon and he was hooked too.
 
After months of thinking, writing, scheming, drinking, eating and whatnot, they ended up with a well defined concept for this new amazing game.

The Game
Basically it is a 4X game. 4X is an acronym for eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate. Most will know these games as Strategy games. Unlike most other 4X games (e.g. Civilization, Galactic Civilizations, Master of Orion and Sins of a Solar Empire) this game will be Massively-Multiplayer oriented and set in a persistent world.
It focuses on construction, economy, diplomacy, research, cooperation and trade; but warfare and other naughty gameplay will also be implemented.
It will mostly resemble a mixture between SimCity and Civilization, but different and much more intertwined in the persistent world. Your village only has two limits:


Available land
Money


Eventually your ""village"" could encompass an entire planet and your empire half a galaxy, but most likely not without aid.
Friends are not required

This game is intended to be playable as a casual browser game, similar to CastleVille, GalaxyLife, AirportCity.
One of the differences from those browser games, is that you are not required to have or help friends in order to obtain some special item which (in the other games) would be required to complete a tutorial or mission.

You will not be forced to add your friends. That is a trend with many popular browser games, which we will not indulge.
We may add a sort of bonus for inviting friends, but none of that ""promote us on facebook by sending your friends resources"", which ends up spamming their facebook-wall.
 

That being said, you can still benefit from having friends near you in the game, as they are more inclined to accept cheaper trade deals, because they trust you to do the same.
It makes it easier to teach each other technologies (for a price of course) to enable quicker improvements to your community as a whole.
You can make a municipality from the beginning and have someone you all trust run the eco-political game, creating better trade deals for you all to benefit from, so you don't have to do the legwork of securing trade deals.
Money CAN buy happiness

Despite the topic, the game will be completely free to play.
Using only your ingame funds (no real money needed), you can purchase your way through the game, instead of researching.

Economy, as well as trade, is an integral part of this game and you can always purchase whatever you need to get ahead.
To be able to buy something you need, another Player must have produced and put that something for sale first (ingame funds only).


This enables an entirely Player-driven market where Players set the price and supply and demand has a very real impact on your income.
Make the best product in your general area, and you decide the price, at least untill someone else makes a better product or sell a slightly inferior product at low, low prices.
As trade routes and interactions grow, so does the range and knowledge of your products. You may end up getting orders for your special goods from further away than you knew existed.

Stockpiling and wearing down
Just because you can produce something in large volumes, doesn't mean you should produce a lot of goods and stockpile them for better times. All goods are perishable to a degree and have a limited lifespan after production (some are long, though).

This includes vehicles, buildings, food, power lines, roads and basically all goods.
Better storage/production methods can improve or even suspend their lifespan, but eventually things will wear out.
Upgrading anything with better materials or production methods will increase their lifespan. As lifespan nears the end, the quality and function/speed of the building/vehicle is reduced; and eventually ceases to function.

Bad news if you are in a spaceship in between planets. But hey, at least your communication equipment is still working, so you can call for help. 

You did remember to replace that old radio, didn't you?




As a consequence of wearing out, an entire village can wear down if it is not attended to by a player. We aim to implement a simple upkeep to handle the village repairs and required materials can be automatically purchased to facilitate this repair. But here you can also save some money by micromanaging the purchase of materials.

Eventually a player decides to leave the game as-is and never to return. This will leave weathered and abandoned villages for other players to pick apart for resources or unknown technologies; or to restore, as they see fit.


A time limit will be determined for how long a player can stay (completely) out of the game, before upkeep payments are suspended and owners rights are lost. Maybe 1 or 2 months. We are not sure yet, but it will be a fair limit. 
People should be able to go on extended vacation without attending to their village. They will miss out on big trade deals or have someone else build resource gathering equipment on their turf while they are on vacation, but at least they will not lose their village.
If owners rights are lost, other players can claim the village (and lands) as theirs. The original player is of course also able to reclaim the village after the time limit, as long as it is unclaimed.




Politics, alliances and communities
Production and trade will be a big part of the game, as they drive the economics, but at some point, you may tire from constant production and wish to learn more about the politics of the region you inhabit.
If you are part of a Municipality, you can contact your Mayor (a player democratically elected), or other leading character (a selfproclaimed dictator perhaps?) and let him know you are interested in joining politics to allow him to make the introduction to other leading characters in the (geo-)political circles/players currently active.
But you can also just introduce yourself, if e.g. you intended to run for Mayor yourself, or just wish to learn more about what is going on. Do note that the Mayor may have access to political discussions you don't, so going through him may help you get into the inner political circle faster.
Help build alliances for your community, help mediate warring (internal?) parties to enable peace and trade, or help covert operations to gain information about your enemies.
You do not have to involve yourself with the community at large, but the political opportunities and power are there for whoever grabs them first.
Research and Technology
Advancing in the game does not require you to do massive amounts of research, although it certainly helps. Research being mostly optional is also what makes this game differ from all the other 4X games. You have the option of purchasing technology from other Players, or simply buying the weapons, goods or services (e.g. competent workforce) you need, regardless whether your own technological level is high enough to create it yourself. All you need is (ingame) money!
The technology tree will be large and intricate, and we do really mean large and intricate. Researching technologies does not just happen over night.
Basically it should not be feasible for a single player to research the entire technology tree alone, at least not without spending a large amount of time playing the game.
The reasonning behind this is to enable (or rather force) Players to create product niches where they produce a superior product that, e.g., other Players require to construct weapons, which they sell to other Players, who use them to conquer and subdue unsuspecting Players.
Some might call this Specialization and cruel. We call it fun and believe it will make the game interesting, because not everyone has the same (technological) advantages. The game will be dynamic and new players in populated areas will probably be asked/paid (or forced) to produce food and other general resources needed by your thriving city (state).
Micropayments
We have played our fair share of browser games which block some advancements or actions, untill you pay. And we don't like that any more than you do!
At some point, micropayments will be enabled, but the game will not require any payment to play to its fullest extent.
Implementing micropayments will not limit the free players or the game experience.
Micropayments will only be intended to give ingame cash advantages:


Pay extra cash as an incentive to workers, so they work longer hours and finish faster, but they cannot complete production in an instant.
Hire extra workers to help speed production along, just make sure your production facility has space for them to work in.


Playing the game
Playing the game should be as easy as possible for those players who just wants to play casually, but there will be options to delve into the micromanagement hell that lies frothing beneath the surface. Micromanaging can result in better products, faster research, cheaper expenses in production and many other benefits. Or micromanaging can cost you precious time that could have been better spent on expanding your knowledge of the territory (available resources) and gaining access to Players (friends/enemies/business partners) to peddle your products to, or spy on for future wars.
The Platform
Well, that sure sounds like a complex game. The big question is, will we release it for Windows, Linux or OSX?

 
The short answer is: For Java and HTML5.
 
Those two technologies should be able to run on basically any platform with an Internet Browser: Windows, OSX, Linux, Unix, Sun, Android, iPhone, and so on, and so forth.

What We Need & What You Get

At the moment Jon and Peter are continually working out the finer details of the game, but needed a game engine to program the game in.
For this purpose, we've come across the Isogenic Engine by Irrelon Software.
Update: Irrelon Software donated the Engine License and two Developer Licenses toward this game on March 29th, 2012. Thank you Rob Evans from Irrelon Software!
This engine has a lot of features working out-of-the-box, which will save us from months, if not years of programming to create something similar ourselves.
Among its features, which we intend to use, you will find:


Advanced Realtime Multiplayer

All nearby players will be able to see and interact with each others villages as they grow, in realtime!



Facebook-integration

Primarily to make it easy to log in and invite your friends (entirely optional of course)
Eventually you can be alerted about important events or problems in your village, without even logging into the game (entirely optional of course)


Very fast canvas-renderer (HTML5)
Using only Java and HTML5 on the clients

 
Update: We can acquired the Game Engine and is now able to start programming. Yay!
Your donation will be used for


Programming and other game-related software.
We try for freeware where possible, but if paid software can noticeably decrease programming time, that would be better.



Travel expenses
Jon and Peter lives about 40 km (24 miles) apart from each other and gasoline/public transportation is not cheap.



Graphic artists, sound, other expertise

Neither Peter nor Jon are strong with graphics or making sounds for games and need to pay someone else to do quality graphics and sounds



Taxes and costs

We live in Denmark and the government here claim about 40-45% of what you donate, as it will be considered a ""regular income"", because we are private people and not running a company (yet).



We plan to create a company at some point in the future to handle the game when it is mature enough, but for now, we need to hang on to our regular incomes to pay our regular expenses.
 
Radically more funding would enable us to hire even more talented people to help build the inner workings of the game faster.
Our target donation is 4884$
Minimum success criteria reached!
Update: Our minimum donations was 834$ as the leftover amount (Indiegogo at 9% did-not-reach-target) of 414$ would cover only the Game Engine.
On March 29th, 2012, only 4 days after the campaign went live, Irrelon Software donated the licenses for the engine and two developers, so we can now start programming!
Donation calculations
Any donations we receive, even if target is not reached, will go toward these expenses, in the order mentioned (except for taxes, which are unavoidable):


Isogenic Engine - Free, as it was donated by Irrelon Software!

Covers independent license + 2 developer licenses
The game engine is absolutely essential to proceed, and now we got it!



Travel expenses - minimum 238$
As not all discussions and planning can be done online, we will need to meet up about every 3rd weekend for the next year

That equals 17 weekends * 2 trips (1 person to and fro) * 40 DKK (7$) per trip using a 10-trip discount card





Graphic artists, sound, other expertise - 1972$ + 414$ that was destined for the game engine

Neither Peter nor Jon are strong graphically and need to have someone else do quality graphics and sounds



Taxes and charges - 2260$

See calculation below



Donations needed: 4884$
The taxes and charges calculations


Subtract 25$ for non-us campaign

4859$ * 4% for Indiegogo = subtract 194.36$

4664.64$ * 3% credit charges = subtract 139.94$

4524.70$ * 42% danish personal taxes = subtract 1900.37$

Leftover: 2624$, which corresponds with above mentioned expenses:238$ (Travel expenses) + 1972$ + 414$ (hiring professionals for graphics and sound).
Taxes and charges: 4884$ (total) - 2624$(leftover) = 2260$.

For the last two years we have been working on a skirmish game based on the world of Wolsung: „Steam Pulp Fantasy“ roleplaying game. We’re now just giving it some finishing touches and the game is ready to be enjoyed by gamers all around the world. Almost all of the miniatures are ready but we still need to print the Rulebooks and manufacture the laser-cut terrains.Overview of the Game:
Wolsung SSG is set in the world which is similar to our world in the turn of nineteenth and twentieth century but filled with magic, steam-powered machines and fantastic creatures such as Elves and Dwarves. The game focuses on the city of Lyonesse – the Pearl amongst cities – and adventures of its residents - Extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen. In the game, players control clubs made of a few such characterful personalities and their servants, to fight for fame and fortune.

Why do we need your contribution:
After the division of the company the Wolsung SSG project slowed down a bit, because we weren’t able to fund everything at once: beautiful graphics, minis, website, the layout of the rulebook and lasercut terrains. We expect that the money gathered on IndieGoGo will help us to speed up the production process – we would really like to have everything done for Essen Spiel 2012 – and let us work on the first big addition to Wolsung SSG – new clubs, new rules and even more fun!

What happens if we surpass our goal:
5000 dollars is enough for us to print the rulebooks and prepare the terrains, but we already have three new clubs which are almost ready to go, as well as the campaign rules and maybe (?) the rules for vehicles. That is a lot of content but we still lack the capacity to fund everything at once. That is why every dollar helps, and brings us closer to expanding the game and allow players to better explore the universe of countless possibilities and Extraordinary Ladies and Gentlemen – the world of Wolsung.

All the models are supplied unassembled and unpainted. You have to bear in mind that all painted sets are hand painted, so it takes time before we can send them.
Please add 5$ for shipping to europe and 10$ outside europe. You just have to add for the shipping once, no matter how many times you contribute. ;)

<p>We are working on a game that takes the concept of the
old text based  RPG but with today’s web technology’s. HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY and awesome
art-work to give the player the best gaming experience.</p>
<p>Instead of boring little clicks to progress there are
mini games to satisfy your appetite. This combined with awesome artwork to go through
cool storylines in an on-line world with generic content. </p>
<p>And all of this is happening in a large and social world
where every player is bound to clash into another.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/604322/files/20140526021506-indie_image3.jpg?1401095706"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>ShotCallers</h3><p></p>
<p>ShotCallers takes place in a dark and twisted copy of our
real world. Players will start as an nobody and need to work their way up. </p>
<p>Players can work alone, start a crew or join an existing
group.  There are lots of assets and
rewards to get, and there will be different ways of achieving them. </p>
<p>Play quests, mini games by yourself or with a group. The
aim of the game is to gain money and power, but this is not a must. </p>
<p>The players can choose to play the game however they
want.</p>
<p>In our concept we have developed a system that can create
new storylines for every player. </p>
<p>These storylines will be based on user´s content. Which
means that the game´s main content will come from the players who play the
game. </p>
<p>This also means that the content of the game is
constantly changing. No longer will you play a game twice and experience or
encounter the same as you did before. </p>
<p>Every time you start again you will see new content.

We are working on a game that takes the concept of the
old text based  RPG but with today’s web technology’s. HTML5, CSS3, JQUERY and awesome
art-work to give the player the best gaming experience.
Instead of boring little clicks to progress there are
mini games to satisfy your appetite. This combined with awesome artwork to go through
cool storylines in an on-line world with generic content. 
And all of this is happening in a large and social world
where every player is bound to clash into another.
ShotCallers
ShotCallers takes place in a dark and twisted copy of our
real world. Players will start as an nobody and need to work their way up. 
Players can work alone, start a crew or join an existing
group.  There are lots of assets and
rewards to get, and there will be different ways of achieving them. 
Play quests, mini games by yourself or with a group. The
aim of the game is to gain money and power, but this is not a must. 
The players can choose to play the game however they
want.
In our concept we have developed a system that can create
new storylines for every player. 
These storylines will be based on user´s content. Which
means that the game´s main content will come from the players who play the
game. 
This also means that the content of the game is
constantly changing. No longer will you play a game twice and experience or
encounter the same as you did before. 
Every time you start again you will see new content.
Besides the human players in the game there will also be artificial intelligence
players. 

They will do whatever they want. Once our
development team releases a set of these players they live their own live and
will be your competitor or friend.Games within the game

ShotCallers has a variety of mini games that will be able
to entertain any kind of player. From single players games to multiplayer
games. 
Action, Strategy, Gamble, puzzle, race, etc... games it´s
all in the game. Whatever game you like to play, the choice is yours. 
We even created a new game type
we would like to call semi multiplayer where players need to work together to
get a total group score. 
The mini games within the game will challenge the users
to master different games, so within the game world there will be lots of
things to do.

In our first version of the game the amount of
games will be limited. But no worries we are dedicated to this project and
promise that the amount of games will keep growing.Social
Since the web is more of a social tool nowadays we want
to make use of this. In ShotCallers you need to be social and work together.
There are different ways of being social. 
Play games together with random strangers or with your
friends. Help out your crew and friends with their drugfarm and get rewarded. 
Or just start a rampage by killing other players and take
what is rightfully yours. 
Besides mini games, you can make or join a team, to work
together and gain domination. 
Joining a crew will also result in more options for the
players since the crew can have missions and status as well. 
Cities and certain parts of the game world will have
domination aspects. A smart and cooperative crew will be most likely the one to
dominate this area. 

Communication and cooperation will be key, and
the game supports a lot of features to communicate with your friends and
enemies.Development
Shotcallers is currently in early alpha. Our goal is to
have a playable version in Januari.
After that, development will continue with regular
updates and expansions.

We want to keep the world alive by keep

gamers the most awesome and fun gaming experience.Why Indiegogo

I have been obsessed with video-games since the 1990's  , I have made various games over the years.
I want to make a full fledged Japanese style 2D RPG for Windows Systems.




About the game


The game ""Legend of Aldenia"" is set in a medieval world much like the worlds of Breath of Fire and Final Fantasy 6 , but will also have a few bit of Sci-Fi like the Phantasy Star games. The main charactor  must save the world from an evil group that is trying to destroy the world! The game will be a mix of classic 2D JRPG with some features of modern RPG such as quick travel and Day/Night cycles.The game is designed for Windows Systems but can be played on a Macusing Winebottler(Winebottler is a windows emulator for Mac).
Over 120 Hours of gameplay!
High Quality 16-Bit Graphics and Sound.



Project Outcomes

Even if the Project Goal is not meet I will continue to work on the game and fund the game myself. The funds raised from Indiegogo will be used to make the game and release it. 
All Contributors of $10 or more will receive a copy of the game.

<p>Welcome to my 2nd Indiegogo campaign! Once again, I'm revisiting the papercraft concepts I initially presented in my second Kickstarter campaign, 3-D Fortress. While technically successful, this early campaign proved to be too ambitious, and for the most part, I ended up refunding my backers on that one.</p>
<p>You can see the original 3-D Fortress campaign HERE: <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/worldswithin/3-d-fortress"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/worldswithin/3-d-fortress</a></p>
<p>Since then, 3-D Fortress has become the springboard for an ongoing series of smaller scale campaigns, including Fantasy Forest I and Fantasy Forest II. One by one, I've continued to develop each of those prototypal scenery pieces into finished products that I feel confident about releasing commercially.</p>
<p>This time, I'm putting out the first finished versions of the thatched-roof cottage model, and the barren tree model. These will be available together through this campaign, as my Village in the Woods combination set!</p>
<p>This campaign will be unlike the others in a few ways. It will be the first one in which I present my new and improved template for collapsible buildings and architecture, which I plan to adapt to more elaborate structures in the future. It's also the first campaign to be a full-fledged collaboration! Although I've used commissioned artwork in the past, this is the first time I'm working side by side with a dedicated artist. Justen Deluca is one of my oldest and closest friends, and a fellow gamer-geek I've been playing Magic cards, D&amp;D, etc. off and on for almost 20 years now. He'll be contributing hand-painted artwork to this set, and will also be working as a production assistant. The Worlds Within sweatshop of one has just doubled in size!</p>
<p>While the basic concept art is more or less finished, backers will have the opportunity to give feedback and make suggestions before we go to the final print and production runs. This is also a bit of a first for my Kickstarter campaigns, and we're both greatly looking forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas, and bringing you the best possible scenery pieces we can!</p>
<p>As with all of my previous papercraft creations, each piece is hand-assembled from color-printed, laminated, machine-cut card stock, for a light but sturdy design. The laminated surfaces are wet and dry erasable, and each piece collapses quickly and easily into a flat configuration for travel and storage. All pieces come ready-to-use, and no painting or assembly is required!</p>
<p>The house model measures approximately 4""x4"", and is about 3"" tall. It includeds roof panels that can be propped open for a view of the interior, a chimney, a functional front door that can be opened or closed, and functional window shutters that can also be opened or closed.</p>
<p>The barren tree model follows the same general template as that used in Fantasy Forest I-III, but has a much more delicate and detailed cut pattern, and is thus more decorative than structural.</p>

A game where there is no final whistle.   Who is the ‘Ideal’ Footstock User?The fan who never stops thinking about the beautiful game.The one who has it built into their DNA. The one who can’t imagine life without it.The genius fan who knows more about their own team than any player currently wearing their clubs sacred shirt.The one who feels the pain in every loss. The hope in every draw. And the ecstasy in every win.The one who can spot real talent in a player before the shirt even fits them.The one who always filled their ‘Panini’ album faster than their mates.The one ready to test their skills of selection/formation/transfers/real player card trades and much more – not only for bragging rights over their mates – but also for cold hard cash. You. The Footstock USPThis is a unique ‘football experience’. A game where there is no final whistle.Footstock takes all the much-loved elements of fantasy footy to a ‘pro’ level - and combines them with the thrill of rising/falling stock market player prices.You build your own squad by buying/winning player cards. And because there is no salary cap, there are huge premiums attached to getting the best cards.Every player card price fluctuates up/down against supply and demand - and of course, recent form.This creates a unique opportunity to use your football knowledge and instinct - to buy and sell players for profit.So, do you splash the cash on a big star someone else is selling in the hope he rediscovers his form? Maybe that under-21 international who’s just broken into the first team is worth a punt? Or do you keep faith with the squad you’ve already built?Footstock is where your football prowess shines and rewards like never before. Where the decisions you make - reap real cash rewards (if you’re right).  
Footstock is 24/7 for a Reason 
Emotion and football - impossible to separate. And rightly so.The joy of winning, the despair of losing and the cruel unpredictability of the game keep our emotions bubbling constantly. We love it.When no midweek fixtures are on – or the dreaded international break tugs at your nuts and puts a shopping trolley over your toes – we hate it.That’s why Footstock is always on, keeping you tapped into the world of real football long after the final whistle.The players from your rivals that you ‘hate’ but would secretly ‘love’ to be in your squad – will be. You may even be rooting for them to perform (unless they’re playing you this week, right?).You’ll soon start supporting these players in your Footstock squad almost as much as you support your own players on a matchday. After all, there’s pride (and cash) at stake.You live the 24/7 non-stop life of a Premier League manager.Constant tweaking of your squad – should you sell that striker who keeps promising to have a stormer but is yet to deliver? Eyes always wide open for a huge deal or a ‘clued-up’ bargain.You also live the 24/7 non-stop life of a Premier League chairman where the buck stops at your door - and it’s your money on the line to invest (or not) in players.  How the Unique Footstock Algorithm WorksFootstock is based on a trading card system. Every Premier League player has their own trading card. Each card has stats unique to that player which reflect their real-life skills and are aggregated to give them an overall score.The buying price for a player is the cheapest purchase price for that player. And, the selling price (if you own that player) represents the highest price you can sell for.Prices and stats change depending on form and demand. The game might be fantasy, but the money involved is real pounds and pence, all adding to the thrill of the game.Players are ranked into 5 classes via their overall performance score. The better a player performs, the rarer and more valuable his cards become. PLAYER CLASSES HOW TO GET YOUR PLAYER CARDS:The cheapest way is to buy packs. Every pack contains 5 cards that are semi-randomly selected by our algorithm. There`s a chance you`ll find the occasional Ballon d'Or winner in a cheap pack, but generally speaking, the more you pay for a pack, the higher the chance you have of bagging world-class players.You can also buy cards from other users and earn cards the more you use and move up the ranks in Footstock.   The 3 Ways To Make Money From Footstock DOING WELL IN FOOTSTOCK FANTASY FOOTBALL COMPETITIONS TRADING PLAYERS ON THE FOOTSTOCK MARKET WINNING CARDS AT THE FOOTSTOCK CASINO How to Earn Money in Footstock Fantasy Football CompetitionsWe offer Fantasy Football style tournaments on all matchdays.The rules are simple: you pick 3 of the players you currently own and pay a buy-in price into the pot.The Footstock scoring system awards points for the actions your players take in ‘real games’ on matchday. If your players score more points than anyone else -you win the pot.Most tourneys have guaranteed prize pools, and there are several freeroll tournaments every week including ‘Pro Level freerolls’ with £50 (or higher) prize pools. *We don’t charge tournament fees: When you play a £50 tourney, you pay £50 into the pot, and that’s all.  There’s no buy-in fee (like you’d pay in an online poker tournament).So, while your FOOTSTOCK squad won`t come completely free (unless you have crazy skill/ luck), it gives you fantastic fantasy football odds once you build it.   Earn Money On The Footstock MarketThis is football’s version of the FTSE index where you get to trade player cards with other fans.Selling Players 
Look to see if someone else wants your player
Decide whether you’re happy with the price they’re offering – if so, agree to sell. They get your player. You get their money.
If you’re not happy with the price, suggest a price at which you’ll be happy to sell.
Wait to see if anyone snaps up your player for the price you’re offering. Seal the deal.
Buying players is equally easy. Just browse the available players, put in bids for the ones you want and hold tight to see if the owner accepts it. If not, consider upping your bid or walking away.The better a player performs in real-world Premier League games (according to our scoring system) the more money he makes you in tourneys. And the market knows – so, find the next Salah, Aguero or Kane early, get him in your squad - and watch his price go through the roof. How to Earn Money in The Footstock CasinoAnother unique feature is the Footstock Casino.Eventually, there will be loads of games here, but we’re opening this feature with STAT ROULETTE. It’s easy, fast and fun, and you can win great players in seconds.Just pick one of your player cards, and the bank randomly selects an opponent player card and a competition stat (e.g. goals). If your player has the better value (e.g. your player has scored 3 goals and the other guy has only 1) you win the opponent’s card. If the other guy wins, you lose your card.Creating Interest in Footstock from the Kick-offIn our quest to gain as many early adopters of Footstock as possible, we will be rewarding those who sign-up early for their courage and trust.They get a 25% discount on all player packs.We will raise the pack prices by 25% when the 2019/20 season kicks off in August 2019 and by another 25% on Boxing Day 2019.The pack prices impact the prices in the market. Get in early and profit from the fact that prices will be higher for everyone who joins after you.   Meet the Footstock Team:TILL (Centre-mid.

<h3><strong>Credit card reward programs are complicated, and that means customers lose out on rewards they could be earning.</strong></h3>
<p>The average credit card customer has 3-4 cards. Credit card issuers like Discover, Bank of America, Capital One and so on all provide reward programs with different terms and conditions. Discover might offer 5% back on movies one month and gas the following month. Bank of America might give you 2% back on groceries, but limit that 2% to only the first $1500 you spend on groceries in a quarter after which it goes down to 1%. These programs are great, but all those rules make it very difficult for the average customer to make the best decision possible to save money. In fact, <strong>the average customer could make hundreds of dollars or more on their credit card rewards every year</strong> just by choosing the best card.</p>
<p>Reward Summit makes it easy to choose the right card by providing a simple mobile application that will tell a customer which card offers the best rewards in seconds. A Reward Summit user can open up the application and select a merchant and get an instant recommendation in just a few seconds, or if you connect your Reward Summit account to Foursquare, we can give you a recommendation automatically when you check-in. (Watch our video to see an early version of the application in action!)</p>
<p>To do this, Reward Summit only needs to know what type of credit cards you carry, but you never have to give the application your account number. If you want to provide some more details about your card balances and limits, the application will take that into consideration when making a recommendation. We maintain a database of credit card reward program conditions and determine the optimal card to use for each individual transaction.</p>
<p>As you can see from our video, we already have an application for iPhone working and functionality for the first release of the application working on our website. The entire demo is 100% real working code, not a prototype. What we need your help with is funding the design work so we can turn this very functional, useful application into one that looks great and customers love to use! The money you pledge as our backers is going to fund the design work and application changes to make this look great. Backers who pledge enough for beta access will get to see this evolution happen as we release these improvements to the folks who are helping test our app!</p>
<p>We have great designers and developers available to us that we have used for previous projects. We've already planned a local pilot beginning in Charlotte, North Carolina with a launch strategy around how we will get the application attention with local consumers and media. Now we just need your help to fund these last few steps to get the application off the ground.</p>

<p>Academics are moving towards a digital medium, from emailing assignments to having live webcast lectures. At any given point there are 6,000,000 students in the United States who are enrolled in online classes. 80% of teachers say that eLearning increases the student’s engagement and quality of work, so it is vital to connect these disadvantaged students with home computer access.  With the ever increasing rate of going digital, it is leaving some students and families behind. In 2012, 46% of the lowest income households in the United States did not own a computer. 100,000,000 households in the United States still do not have a high speed internet connection, nor does it help when the cost of new technologies in the United States is significantly more expensive than other developed countries. <a href=""http://thedigitalbridge.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Digital Bridge Foundation</a> will offset the initial expense of a home computer purchase by providing a refurbished home desktop PC for students and families.</p>

<p>I am a above average player because I study the game and have had excellent results part time. I aim to turn $15000 into a $100000 and move that goal forward accordingly. I will post videos of my progress online (YouTube).</p>

<h3>Choice: Texas is an interactive fiction game about abortion access in Texas</h3>
<p>Choice: Texas is an educational interactive fiction game which will be freely available on the web. Players will explore the game through one of several characters, each of whom reflects specific socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic factors impacting abortion access in Texas. Although billed as interactive fiction, Choice: Texas is based on extensive research into healthcare access, legal restrictions, geography, and demographics, and is reflective of the real circumstances facing women in the state.</p>
<p>Choice: Texas is being developed by Allyson Whipple (writer, editor, and poet) and Carly Kocurek (writer and cultural historian) with the help of illustrator Grace Jennings. </p>
<h3>What Funding Will Cover</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $9,250 to fund the completion of the game. This amount covers web development, including design and hosting services; the promotion of the game through conferences; payment for professional illustrations; and, of course, all the neat swag we’re offering to campaign contributors. Funding will ensure the game is as accessible and polished as possible.</p>
<p>This is a flexible fundraising campaign, which means if we raise part of the money, we’ll still receive all funds raised. Because of this, we might wind up with only part of our budget.

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We’re offering a lot of perks at varying levels, most featuring game artwork by Grace Jennings. Grace’s work is beautiful, and we’re thrilled both to be working with her, and to be offering her original illustrations as a perk at the $500 level. While you can see all the perks over in the right column, we’d like to draw your attention to a few in particular:</p>
<p><b>Tote Bags</b></p>
<p>We will be producing a limited run of reusable tote bags featuring the Choice: Texas logo. A tote bag will be mailed to everyone who contributes $50 or more.</p>
<p><b>Producer Credit</b></p>
<p>If you contribute $250 or more, you will be listed as a producer in the game credits on the official website, alongside the designer, illustrator, and other members of the development team.</p>
<p><b>Original Artwork</b></p>
<p>We have a very limited number of original, custom digital illustrations by Grace Jennings. to give away. Each illustration will be of the person or pet you choose, and will be delivered to you electronically for whatever print or electronic use you deem fit. To receive this perk, contribute $500 or more.</p>
<p>(Shipping is included in the price of all perks.)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are billing Choice: Texas as “a very serious game,” and we mean that. While the game is intended to be engaging, the issues it addresses are very serious. Women’s access to reproductive healthcare in Texas is significantly limited, a state of affairs that is especially true for women who are working class or poor, or who live in rural areas. One of the great strengths of games is that they can invite players to explore other people’s experiences; Choice: Texas is such a game, and asks players to seriously consider the plight of Texas women. </p>
<p>Choice: Texas has already gained some positive responses, including acceptance into the Future and Reality of Gaming (F.R.O.G.) 2013 Conference in Vienna. We will have a working prototype of the game prepared by the conference dates in late September, and look forward to completing the game by February 2014. Both Allyson and Carly have a long track record of successful creative projects, ranging from poetry chapbooks to blog posts, to conferences, websites, and public programs. We know we can complete this project. We have already invested the time necessary to complete research and preliminary drafts. Funding will help make Choice: Texas the best it can be. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everyone has the resources to contribute financially to this campaign, and that is completely okay. We’re already grateful that you took the time to learn more about our project. But, if you’re excited about the project and want to help out, there are a lot of things you can do, the biggest help of which is getting the word out. Post this campaign to Facebook or Twitter, e-mail your friends, take advantage of IndieGoGo’s social tools. Every bit helps, and is greatly appreciated.</p>

Choice: Texas is an educational interactive fiction game which will be freely available on the web. Players will explore the game through one of several characters, each of whom reflects specific socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic factors impacting abortion access in Texas. Although billed as interactive fiction, Choice: Texas is based on extensive research into healthcare access, legal restrictions, geography, and demographics, and is reflective of the real circumstances facing women in the state.
Choice: Texas is being developed by Allyson Whipple (writer, editor, and poet) and Carly Kocurek (writer and cultural historian) with the help of illustrator Grace Jennings. 
What Funding Will Cover
We are looking to raise $9,250 to fund the completion of the game. This amount covers web development, including design and hosting services; the promotion of the game through conferences; payment for professional illustrations; and, of course, all the neat swag we’re offering to campaign contributors. Funding will ensure the game is as accessible and polished as possible.
This is a flexible fundraising campaign, which means if we raise part of the money, we’ll still receive all funds raised. Because of this, we might wind up with only part of our budget. However, we have carefully prioritized our costs to ensure that we fulfill all our obligations to contributors and still produce a playable game that is published to the web. So, no matter what you contribute, and no matter what the total of funds raised, rest assured that you will be directly contributing to the success of the game.

You are already a winner by stepping onto that mat.”<br/><br/> With that he just smiled and slowly ran on to the mat, ready for battle, but half knowing what the probable outcome would be.<br/><br/> When you first see Nishan you will notice that his legs are frail - very frail. So frail that they have to be supported by custom made, form fitted braces to help support and straighten his limbs. <br/><br/> Braces that I recognize all to well. <br/><br/> Some would say Nishan has a handicap. <br/><br/> I say that he has a gift.<br/><br/> To me the word handicap is a word that describes what one “can’t do”. <br/><br/> That doesn’t describe Nishan. <br/><br/> Nishan is doing. <br/><br/> The word “gift” is a word that describes something of value that you give to others. <br/><br/> And without knowing it, Nishan is giving us all a gift. <br/><br/> I believe Nishan’s gift is inspiration. <br/><br/> The ability to look the odds in the eye and say “You don’t pertain to me.” <br/><br/> The ability to keep moving forward. <br/><br/> Perseverance. <br/><br/> A “Whatever it takes” attitude.<br/><br/> As he predicted, the outcome of his match wasn’t great. <br/><br/> That is, if the only thing you judge a wrestling match by is the actual score. Nishan tried as hard as he could, but he couldn’t overcome the twenty-six pound weight difference that he was giving up to his opponent on this day in order to compete. You see, Nishan weighs only 80 pounds and the lowest weight class in this tournament was 106. Nishan knew he was spotting his opponent 26 pounds going into every match on this day. He wrestled anyway.<br/><br/> I never did get the chance to ask him why he wrestles, but if I had to guess I would say, after watching him all day long, that Nishan wrestles for the same reasons that we all wrestle for. <br/><br/> We wrestle to feel alive, to push ourselves to our mental, physical and emotional limits - levels we never knew we could reach. <br/><br/> We wrestle to learn to use 100% of what we have today in hopes that our maximum today will be our minimum tomorrow. We wrestle to measure where we started from, to know where we are now, and to plan on getting where we want to be in the future. We wrestle to look the seemingly insurmountable opponent right in the eye and say, “Bring it on. - I can take whatever you can dish out.” <br/><br/> Sometimes life is your opponent and just showing up is a victory.<br/><br/> You don't need to score more points than your opponent in order to accomplish that. <br/><br/> No Nishan didn’t score more points than any of his opponents on this day, that would have been nice, but I don’t believe that was the most important thing to Nishan. Without knowing for sure - the most important thing to him on this day was to walk with pride like a wrestler up to a thirty two foot circle, have all eyes from the crowd on him, to watch him compete one on one against his opponent - giving it all that he had. That is what competition is all about. Most of the times in wrestling you are competing against yourself. Nishan is no different. <br/><br/> They say 80% of life is just showing up. <br/><br/> Nishan showed up today. <br/><br/> He showed up when most others would have stayed in the stands. <br/><br/> Today all of Nishan’s opponents may have scored more points than him, but he competed. He competed against his opponents, he competed against himself and he competed against life. <br/><br/> And no matter what the score may have said in any one of his matches - he won in every case. <br/><br/> You later learn in life how important the disciplines of wrestling are to you in handling real life problems, especially when facing a seemingly insurmountable opponent in a disease or illness. <br/><br/> If you live long enough, life will throw you to your back. <br/><br/> And when it does - you are much better off if you have had wrestled. <br/><br/> You will know how to fight like hell to get off of your back, to get back on your feet and to move forward.<br/><br/> Chances are that I probably will never see Nishan again. <br/><br/> That is just how life works. <br/><br/> “Wrestling brother” - keep moving forward. <br/><br/> And thank you for the gift. <br/><br/> You are an inspiration. <br/><br/><span> ______________________________</span>____________________________<br/><br/> Prologue:<br/> I have had the pleasure of being <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nishan.patel.315?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Nishan Patel </a>facebook friend for a few years now and I have watched him go after every one of his dreams.<br/><br/> He is currently going to represent the USA at the International Level this summer at the Paralympic games.<br/><br/>He needs some support in order to make that dream a reality.<br/></span></span>And I would like to help him make his dream a reality. </p></div>","Here is an article that I wrote a few years ago when I met an outstanding young man named Nishan Patel.Why Do You Wrestle?

  4.) plus ein  kostenloser werbefreie Account für Dich
  5.) plus ein  1:1 Guthaben für den Kauf virtueller Güter bei OnQui
Wenn das Kampagnenziel  nicht erreicht wird, verwenden wir Dein Geld für die Erstellung neuer Fragen, Online Werbung  und den Perks 1.) und 2.). Allerdings kann das Spiel dann im Augenblick leider nicht weiterentwickelt werden.
Die Auswirkung
Dein finanzieller Beitrag sorgt dafür, dass OnQui weiterentwickelt und wieder  ein großes Stück mehr in der Öffentlichkeit (deutschsprachiger Raum) bekannt wird.
  Da OnQui als Webapplikation und Android App spielbar ist, kann man jederzeit  und überall auf der Welt sein Wissen spielerisch vergrößern. Gerade für Länder  mit einem hohen Wissensstandard ist das ein Mehrwert.
  Zu meiner Person:
  Ich habe Angewandte Physik studiert und mir während den letzten 10 Jahren ein  umfangreiches Wissen im Bereich Webentwicklung angeeignet. In den letzten 2  Jahren war ich fast ausschließlich mit OnQui beschäftigt und setze natürlich  mein Herzblut in das Projekt. An Motivation fehlt es also nicht.
Andere Wege, wie Du helfen kannst
Wenn dir OnQui gefällt kannst Du uns natürlich gerne weiterempfehlen. Auch  das würde uns schon sehr helfen:

<h3>CHECK UPDATES</h3>
<p>For information on the drawings I am offering. You might learn a thing or two more about what I can do.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What's This All About?</h3>
<p>So, they call me Cessy. At least online they do ...<br/>I'm not only a youtuber, but I'm a gamer. I've been obsessed with gaming since I was a young girl, and now, so many years later, I'm still at it. Only now, I'm able to share my games with the world through the all so wonderful YouTube.</p>
<p>I've been uploading Let's Plays for just about a year now, and it's truly become quite the passion. It's entertaining to many, and I'm doing what I enjoy doing best, so it's a win win situation really.<br/>Unfortunately though, with these new popular games that are coming out and are becoming more and more advanced, as well as requested, I have come to an almost standstill. This little Acer computer can't seem to handle such great graphics, let alone recording my progress within.<br/>You see, I have some of those high graphics games, and when I play them, I am only able to do so reducing the graphics to low quality, and that's not exactly what I want to show to my fans. I don't find it fair to them, to have them look at really bad quality video. I wouldn't enjoy it, so why would they?<br/>With a new computer, a much more powerful one, I will be able to do what I can only dream of doing right now.<br/>Not only would I be able to enjoy these games with amazing high graphic quality, but I will be able to continue sharing my Let's Plays with the world. Or well, my subscribers that is.<br/>With more quality content, I might even be able to get that partnership I've been aiming towards. The better the quality, the better my chances.</p>
<p>Let's just say that I am ready to move up in the gaming world. I just can't do it just yet.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>Top of the line gaming computers aren't cheap. The better they are, the more expensive. That's why I'm asking for the money that I am. That $3500 will not only get me one of those top of the line gaming computers, but if I have any let over, I will be able to even get a better quality monitor to show the graphics even better. But that would be for my eyes only. The tower itself is what my heart is yearning for. The one that can bring my gaming to life, and the best quality video for youtube. Something that I just can't wait to achieve.</p>
<p>What do you get out of it? Well, that's quite simple. I'm gathering up whatever resources I can, and giving what I can. Everyone will get a shoutout in a video of mine. In fact, once this campaign is over, whether or not I reach my goal, I will record a video, giving a shoutout to each and every contributor, whether you've donated $1 to $10 to any other amount.<br/>For many, there will be chibi pictures drawn. For others, non-chibi anime pictures. Ah yes, have I mentioned my love of drawing as well? No, I don't believe that I have ...<br/>There will be twitter shoutouts, steam adds, and even meet-ups if you live in the Toronto area. Gaming meet ups of course!<br/>For a limited few, there will be a few games involved that I have indeed received for free, though you will need a steam account to receive them.<br/><br/>Other perks include co-op gaming, uploaded onto youtube including shoutouts, especially if you have a youtube account, gaming or not. I may not be a large youtuber just yet, but I will get there.</p>
<p>Aside from all those perks, as time goes on, I will add even more of them, all depending on what happens between now and 60 days from now.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if I achieve my goal, and have the money leftover, I can use that to purchase other games to not only play myself, but to give to you amazing donators &lt;3 I love you all.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal, rest assured that the money received will still go towards a new gaming computer. Even if a little, it will help bring myself closer to a beautiful new gaming rig that will allow me much better videos for the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>But ... Why?</h3>
<div>
<p>Video game graphics have grown and expanded so much. They have become almost realistic, and are getting better every day. Unfortunately, as these graphics advance, so do gaming computers. The RAM, the processor cores, sound cards, graphic cards ... just about everything within a computer would need to be able to keep up with that particular video game. Either that, or you're stuck not only playing with minecraft-like graphics, but also with lag (and if you're a gamer, you know how annoying that is) and a really bad quality recording. Assuming that recording program will even be able to work if you're using up all the memory just for the game. It's just such an expensive thing to keep up with.</p>
<p>I know I'm just some girl you've never met, and you're probably asking yourself, why help?<br/>Well, you're right. I am just a simple girl who enjoys video games. But see, because of this passion, I have grown to be who I am. When I realized that I could record my gaming, upload it to youtube, and possibly one day become a partner and even get paid for it, I was in awe. Get paid for doing something that I enjoy? I didn't even know that was possible.<br/>Well, surprisingly to most, it is possible. Unfortunately, it does take a little bit of time to get to that point. Time and money. I have the time ... it's the money that's becoming harder and harder to get. Even with jobs, bills and other life necessities seem to get in the way of a dream this grand.<br/>I am a simple girl yes. But I'm a girl with a big dream.</p>
<p>Wolves of the Night Gaming is not just for me. It's for all the gamers who are interested in watching Let's Plays and tutorials. All gamers who wish to have a laugh with the jokes that are said. For all who just want to sit back, and have a good time watching a video that they can relate with and know that the graphics aren't ... well, crappy. You can help, and you won't regret it. Even you will be able to see how much better the quality will become.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>You can't donate? That's quite alright!</h3>
<p>As I said before, even with jobs, it is quite difficult to save money. But aside from just that, it's even harder to donate to a cause you may just want to support.<br/>There are other ways you can help though.<br/>Tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell anyone you know. Maybe, just maybe, there's someone out there who has a few extra dollars they are willing to help out with. Whether it's $1 or $5, every little bit counts. And trust me, every little bit does help, especially in this case.<br/>A <strong>tweet</strong>, a <strong>facebook share</strong>, even a link share to a <strong>guild</strong>, <strong>league</strong>, <strong>clan</strong> etc ... or even a <strong>youtube shoutout</strong>. I would appreciate every bit of help I can get.<br/>You'd be surprised how far just a little shoutout can go.</p>

</div><br/></div>","////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////Vector Scissors feature a unique flat edge design that allows you to cut perfectly straight lines every time.







The handle is designed with a lip that can grab the edge of a table using it as a guide




You start going forward and it glides along a sheet of paper slicing it perfectly apart.



You can also cut a right angle without measuring and drawing the angle by using the corner of a square table as a pivot.



As a result, you don't need to use a ruler and a pencil to pre-mark the cutting line, or use a blade with an under-plate in order to prevent scratching your tabletop.

They feel natural in the hand for any other cutting task. But whenever you need Vector will cut a straighter line than any other scissors.


Choose from five fancy colors









Main advantages

- Cutting curves and cutting straight with one tool
- Cutting length is not limited
- Comfortable an convenient to use




""Yet when to comes to the common task of cutting in a straight line, craftspeople would have little choice but to break out heavy-duty solutions like paper cutters. Concepts like the Vector Scissors..., may someday fill that void...

""Genius! Scissors have evolved slowly over the years ... Designer Tamás Fekete has sliced through millennia of shear repetition and designed a new pair of scissors…""

Vector Scissors are one of those designs that make you say “duh!” For the 99.9% of us who can’t cut a straight line, they make getting it right each time a cinch.

<p><span>Terry &amp; I (Clinton) stumbled upon each other while beginning our game making journey on related forums. We found that our values, vision and thinking are very alike and decided to partner up to form a startup to make the creations in our minds.</span></p>
<p>Pariunos Entertainment is our startup that concentrates on making mobile games. We try to make our artwork attractive, kids friendly and aim at making fun games with less blood. Our targeted audience are children, teenagers and young adults. And apart from making mobile apps, we wish to make our creations a part of our player’s lives by building a brand they will come to love.</p>
<p><span>It has been our thoughts that we wish to launch a game for each big festive occasion so that people can enjoy their time while traveling around or if they have nothing to do during these days.</span></p>
<p>Our idea “No Dracula” came up due to the upcoming Halloween as well as a new Dracula movie coming out in October. As mentioned before, our games are aimed at a younger group so all our artwork are cute and simple and the gameplay design are also simple to grasp. Having said that our game will be hard to master and will hopefully be having monthly updates to keep players coming back for more by growing the content.</p>
<p>The game will be free to download with in-app purchases to help players out when it gets too hard.</p>
<p>At the moment, our game is in demo stage in which the link is available <a href=""http://www.pariunos.com/NoDracula/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here.</a> The demo is only available for devices with touch screens. Best tested on smartphones.</p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Terry與我(Clinton)對製作遊戲都有濃厚興趣，我們在相關的網上討論區上認識對方。我們發覺大家的價值觀、願景‏及思維都相約，於是我們便合作把心中的構思製作成遊戲。</span><br/></p>
<p><span><span>一等娛樂(Pariunos Entertainment)的成立是在於專注手機遊戲的製作。我們理念是會創作畫面吸引、受兒童歡迎及一些沒有血腥暴力的遊戲。我們的目標市場是小朋友、少年和年青成年人。在製作遊戲之餘，我們都希望我們的創作能夠成為每個玩家都愛戴的品牌。</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>我們的構思是想在每個重要節日都能夠推出相關的遊戲，令玩家在旅行中或百無聊賴的時候可以享受遊戲的樂趣。</span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>我們創作遊戲“No Dracula”的構思是由於萬聖節將到，而且10月也會有一齣關於德古拉的電影會上映。以上提及過，我們的遊戲的目標是較年輕的市場，所以圖像走簡單可愛路線而玩法也容易上手。話雖如此，遊戲是易學難精的。我們希望每月都能提供更新讓玩家繼續會玩這遊戲。</span><br/></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>遊戲是免費下載的，備有軟件內付費內容能幫助玩家通過難度高的關數。</span><br/></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>現時我們的遊戲還在試玩階段，你可<a href=""http://www.pariunos.com/NoDracula/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">在此下載</a>試玩版。試玩版只支援有觸控輸入的裝置，建議在智能手機上試玩。</span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Because we're a startup, this is our first proper project and we hope we can get help from all interested players to support us through crowdfunding.  We have very limited resources for our startup, so we wish to raise some funds using this method as well as to gain some exposure for what we're doing.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>The game is actually quite simple to make for a professional programmer. Maybe take them a few days to complete everything. For us, since we're amateurs it will probably take us one or two months, which will be past the Halloween period. That is why we'll leave it to the professionals, but at a cost.</span></p>
<p>We also need to raise funds for marketing the game once it's done and there really isn't a limit to the amount of marketing that needs to be done to any product or service. But as our first project, we're happy to get 100,000 downloads. So apart from the supporters from indiegogo we would most likely promote our game via Facebook ads, YouTube ads, etc. </p>
<br/><p>We're looking to raise $5000 USD in which  more than half will be for making the perks and sending them out. Some parts of it will be deducted from PayPal and Indiegogo for their services. The rest of the funds will be used on marketing our game out &amp; hiring part-time helpers to manage the marketing aspects of our game.</p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<div>The perks available for supporters include stickers, T-Shirts &amp; Glow-In-Dark T-Shirts with our designs on them. Some of them will be limited editions that will only be available on our Indiegogo project and never to be made again.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><span>因我們剛剛起步，這是首個正式作品，我們希望感興趣的玩家可以藉著群眾集資平台來支助我們。我們只有有限的資源來起動，所以我們希望用此方法募集資金及爭取多點曝光率。</span></p>
<span>對專業程式編寫員來說，這遊戲其實是很容易製作，可能幾天就可以完成。但對業餘的我們來說，可能要用上一兩個月的時間，到時萬聖節都已經過去了。所以我們要交給專業的人員製作，但這是有成本的。</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span><p><span>遊戲完成後我們也需要透過集資得來的資金來做營銷推廣，一般產品或服務的營銷金額可以是無上限的‏。但以我們的首個遊戲來說，如能達到十萬次下載已很滿意。所以除了在Indiegogo的支持者外，我們應會投放資金於Facebook及Youtube廣告等地方。</span></p>我們希望能募集到5000美元，其中超過一半資金會用作製作及寄出津貼禮品。當中一部份花費是Paypal及Indiegogo的服務費。其餘的資金會是用於遊戲的營銷推廣及聘請兼職員工來處理營銷推廣方面的事務。<br/></span></div>
<div><span><span>計劃支助者的津貼禮品包括有我們設計的貼紙、T恤及夜光版T恤。當中有些會是Indiegogo計劃的限量版，以後不會再生產的。</span><br/></span></div>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/639/928/dbf01d9ad2335a2507c0f71521e5c157_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459615776&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=31af2d856e314f92c5698ba78d147ae8"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>The game tells the story of eight people whose everyday lives are forever changed after a horrific plane crash. They now find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere, deep in the forests of Alaska. Welcome to a world without civilization, where you and the other survivors are at the mercy of nature — and wild animals starved by the cold!</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/639/934/70ab66c7a6421f65efc60bd40bd33ec6_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459615822&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=bf6d2ca970e07bcb5289a3b5770d0f17"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 266px;""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>While the survivors await rescue, their lives are threatened by a number of mysterious entities, unseen creatures and objects that definitely don’t belong in this world. And the deeper you go, the harder it gets to survive. Through the storyline you’ll desperately try to reach help on the radio, but no one’ll answer you. Something is wrong here. In here is no room for mistakes: if you went hunting but forgot to cut some wood for the fire before nightfall, you’re dead. If you didn’t have time to cook your meat, you might have to eat it raw — and if you don’t have medicine, you’ll surely die from food poisoning. To stay alive, you’ll need to scavenge and craft like a pro.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>You can play <i>The Wild Eight</i> on your own, but the game fully opens up in co-op mode. Other players are your only backup — either by sharing resources or covering your back! Even if you were mauled by wolves and ""you died"" appears onscreen, your teammate can still resuscitate you with a defibrillator (which are very rare to find, by the way).</p>

<p>The game world is a little like a chessboard. It’s made out of tiles, and each of them is unique. At the start of the game, every tile is used to randomly generate a new world and distinct locations for each quest.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/640/093/5983b760d3f86c94dc5fe9c937601951_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459617620&amp;q=92&amp;s=9a60f8452119efff7478d479e6b43a83"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Time here moves fast: Temperature drops as it gets darker (you’ll need a bonfire!), and you’ll also need to secure some food if you intend to survive until morning. Weather varies from sunny to severe storms, with duration and intensity randomly decided by the game engine.</p>
<p><b>Are They All Friends?</b></p>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/773/f5cd7e15b49730795529ecaa5e1ac28b_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459521138&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=3080674ebfcad46d4c60ce6effef9322"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Survive and explore the forest side by side with other players or go solo. Cooperation is the right way to face this harsh world — that is, until a psycho is revealed to be part of the group! Will he or she go for the prize... or taste human flesh?</p>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/785/faedf59c99e10f3693d7e38c1d14662f_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459521233&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=c7839708879e989e11f2e60275031f4e"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Leveling up is represented by linear categories, which are divided by related quests. Just as in real life, if someone suddenly turns away from civilization, he or she has to start by learning the basics: how to make a fire, how to navigate the woods, and how to craft armor, spears, bows — along with more sophisticated tools and weapons.</p>
<p><b>Crafting is the Only Way to Stay Alive</b></p>
<div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/786/d103877ae071211110e6ba6cf02015fd_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459521252&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=483306ccbc69137ee84b4dcf546c1f57"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>There are two types of crafting: on the go, and at the workshop. You can build base equipment like flares or basic weapons on the go. At the workshop, you have more resources: it is now possible to create and upgrade complicated objects such as custom backpacks, traps, bandages, and lots of other useful trinkets.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
<div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/788/f56da8cc250cbc7f602ff0c94f10b575_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459521275&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=7239528fa772bea82479d5f648d876a1"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>The game’s plot is divided into a main campaign and additional quests. You can finish the game without completing a single side quest; however, side quests are essential if you want to have a shot at a happy ending. </p>
<p>We’ll split the story into three; each one will be associated with the current location. When the location of the main story is initially generated, the location of all side quests will be randomly defined — placing key events in locations equally distant from one another.</p>
<p><b>Your Choice: Killing Vs. Running</b></p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/793/968afff7cd9a54c438aa46fc36e7926f_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459521298&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8b0f05f588ecd00617edd20545b3f59c"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>The game features two types of creatures: passive and aggressive. Passive are animals that don’t want to harm you. These are the easiest to hunt for: rabbits, deer, wild boars, etc. Passive behavior can also differ; for example, rabbits run away when you approach, while boars always try to fight back.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/634/098/14c290633defc0ed446724f0f83d9ae4_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459523761&amp;q=92&amp;s=e5a45d16a586eb413d3711fa7860e60b"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Aggressive animals can and will kill you in a head-to-head scramble. You’ll need to run or kill them with a good weapon. Keep in mind that even one bite might ruin everything; you’ll start to bleed immediately and there is only one chance to stay alive: bandaging yourself.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/633/917/7392dc6b2c54411777c0f8917235e11c_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459522218&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=0b786fd72ef7dbfb06e450357f147b8c"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>The soundtrack plays a key role in conveying the emotional undertones of the game to players. We are currently working on the main theme, which you'll hear during gameplay at different times.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of tracks hosted on Soundcloud:</p>

<p>In August 2015, we were about to make a racing game with guns (like Twisted Metal), but we decided that it would be best to make a game based on life itself. Our life, that is — something that we remember from childhood. So in September, we assembled a team of eight people. Each of us had previous experience in game development, so we knew what to do and what it took to ship a game. We were ready to work late, get almost no sleep, work on weekends — and fully devote ourselves to the game. </p>

<p>By the end of 2015, we came up with the core gameplay loop and made it into a a small demo with all the necessary design elements and 3D models. We spent all of January getting ready for the first announcement, which took place on February 11th. Today we have already reached alpha. We're now working on multiplayer, quests, animations, and more — which is why we need your help!</p>

<p>8 Points was founded in 2015. We’re all from different studios, where many of us had been working on casual games. We quickly realized our passion was not with casual titles, but for deeply immersive experiences — which led the team to <i>The Wild Eight</i>!</p>

<p>Our team consists of 9 developers: 4 programmers, 3 artists, CEO, and CMO. We live in one of the strangest and coldest places on Earth: It’s called Yakutia, where people eat bears for breakfast, develop games for lunch, and gather firewood for dinner — because electricity is too expensive.

<p><i>“When I first was told about The Wild Eight, I was expecting another cookie-cutter indie game, but this is definitely something different. One of the good ones. It’s got many components of a standout game - stylish graphics, captivating atmosphere, a compelling narrative hook, mysteries that beg to be investigated, and heavy consequences for player choices. I don’t play games often anymore, but this is one of the few that has my mouth watering.”</i></p>

While the survivors await rescue, their lives are threatened by a number of mysterious entities, unseen creatures and objects that definitely don’t belong in this world. And the deeper you go, the harder it gets to survive. Through the storyline you’ll desperately try to reach help on the radio, but no one’ll answer you. Something is wrong here. In here is no room for mistakes: if you went hunting but forgot to cut some wood for the fire before nightfall, you’re dead. If you didn’t have time to cook your meat, you might have to eat it raw — and if you don’t have medicine, you’ll surely die from food poisoning. To stay alive, you’ll need to scavenge and craft like a pro.
 
 
You can play The Wild Eight on your own, but the game fully opens up in co-op mode. Other players are your only backup — either by sharing resources or covering your back! Even if you were mauled by wolves and ""you died"" appears onscreen, your teammate can still resuscitate you with a defibrillator (which are very rare to find, by the way).

 A Mysterious World Outside Time and Space
 
 
The game world is a little like a chessboard. It’s made out of tiles, and each of them is unique. At the start of the game, every tile is used to randomly generate a new world and distinct locations for each quest.
 
 
Time here moves fast: Temperature drops as it gets darker (you’ll need a bonfire!), and you’ll also need to secure some food if you intend to survive until morning. Weather varies from sunny to severe storms, with duration and intensity randomly decided by the game engine.
Are They All Friends?
 
 
Survive and explore the forest side by side with other players or go solo. Cooperation is the right way to face this harsh world — that is, until a psycho is revealed to be part of the group! Will he or she go for the prize... or taste human flesh?
Survival is Not a Given
 
 
Death is at every corner — especially hunger and cold. Make sure to secure a constant supply of food by hunting or gathering, and spend time to cook it so that you stay healthy and warm.
New Skills = Better Chances
 
 
Leveling up is represented by linear categories, which are divided by related quests. Just as in real life, if someone suddenly turns away from civilization, he or she has to start by learning the basics: how to make a fire, how to navigate the woods, and how to craft armor, spears, bows — along with more sophisticated tools and weapons.
Crafting is the Only Way to Stay Alive

 
There are two types of crafting: on the go, and at the workshop. You can build base equipment like flares or basic weapons on the go. At the workshop, you have more resources: it is now possible to create and upgrade complicated objects such as custom backpacks, traps, bandages, and lots of other useful trinkets.
 

Motivation

 
The game’s plot is divided into a main campaign and additional quests. You can finish the game without completing a single side quest; however, side quests are essential if you want to have a shot at a happy ending. 
We’ll split the story into three; each one will be associated with the current location. When the location of the main story is initially generated, the location of all side quests will be randomly defined — placing key events in locations equally distant from one another.
Your Choice: Killing Vs. Running
 
 
The game features two types of creatures: passive and aggressive. Passive are animals that don’t want to harm you. These are the easiest to hunt for: rabbits, deer, wild boars, etc. Passive behavior can also differ; for example, rabbits run away when you approach, while boars always try to fight back.
 
 
Aggressive animals can and will kill you in a head-to-head scramble. You’ll need to run or kill them with a good weapon. Keep in mind that even one bite might ruin everything; you’ll start to bleed immediately and there is only one chance to stay alive: bandaging yourself.
 
 
The soundtrack plays a key role in conveying the emotional undertones of the game to players. We are currently working on the main theme, which you'll hear during gameplay at different times.
Here are a couple of tracks hosted on Soundcloud:
 

Imperception // Main Theme
Go far, go wide // Snow desert

A vertical layering interactive music system maximizes player immersion in The Wild Eight. Music will be composed of different layers, which can be switched on and off depending on what’s taking place in-game.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In August 2015, we were about to make a racing game with guns (like Twisted Metal), but we decided that it would be best to make a game based on life itself. Our life, that is — something that we remember from childhood. So in September, we assembled a team of eight people. Each of us had previous experience in game development, so we knew what to do and what it took to ship a game. We were ready to work late, get almost no sleep, work on weekends — and fully devote ourselves to the game. 
 
 
By the end of 2015, we came up with the core gameplay loop and made it into a a small demo with all the necessary design elements and 3D models. We spent all of January getting ready for the first announcement, which took place on February 11th. Today we have already reached alpha. We're now working on multiplayer, quests, animations, and more — which is why we need your help!
 
 
 
8 Points was founded in 2015. We’re all from different studios, where many of us had been working on casual games. We quickly realized our passion was not with casual titles, but for deeply immersive experiences — which led the team to The Wild Eight!
 
Pretending to be rock stars in front of the famous Lena Pillars 
Our team consists of 9 developers: 4 programmers, 3 artists, CEO, and CMO. We live in one of the strangest and coldest places on Earth: It’s called Yakutia, where people eat bears for breakfast, develop games for lunch, and gather firewood for dinner — because electricity is too expensive. Who else would know anything about surviving in the wild if not us?
 
 
“When I first was told about The Wild Eight, I was expecting another cookie-cutter indie game, but this is definitely something different. One of the good ones. It’s got many components of a standout game - stylish graphics, captivating atmosphere, a compelling narrative hook, mysteries that beg to be investigated, and heavy consequences for player choices. I don’t play games often anymore, but this is one of the few that has my mouth watering.”
– Zach Hanks, Voice Actor & Director
 
 
Whether you’ve backed us or not, we want to sincerely thank you your interest in our project. We are constantly working on the game and would love to share some interesting news through our social networks. Looking forward to seeing you take part in The Wild Eight communities on Facebook and Twitter!",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>An idea comes to life</h3>
<p>Daniel Solis and Terry South are the founders of CGA, the Classic Gaming Association. The CGA was created just over a year ago to bring people and classic arcade games together. The CGA does this thru free public events and monthly meet ups in our own facility. That, in turn, is sponsored by  Arcade Wizards, which does service and repair for classic cabinets.</p>
<p>We knew right away we needed room to do the work and a place the public could meet with access to our classic games so the CGA could get off the ground. Arcade Wizards allowed the CGA to be born. But, the building we have cannot accommodate all the classic arcade games and the monthly meet ups since the CGA attendance has outgrown our facility. A larger building is needed and access to the games by the public more often than once a month. Necessity gave way to the creation of Z82. To both have a building for the restored games and daily access for the public.</p>
<p>Daniel Solis is a 20 year veteran of the amusement industry. He is a restoration specialist and historian who knows what the classics should look and play like.</p>
<p>Terry South is a 35 year veteran of the amusement industry who is board level in repair of classic arcade games. He strives to return these games to full glory.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are building a Retrocade here in the Central Arkansas area. We have purchased 115 classic arcade machines over the past year. 50 of our machines are in working condition with 10 games already totally completed. We are proactive. You can see our work in youtube videos on the Z82 Retrocade channel. We really can do this.</li>
<li>Your contributions help with restorations, repairs and prep for the Grand Opening and the high cost of materials to complete the work.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funding we need is $45,000. This will cover the cost of materials for not only restorations and repairs but, renovations to the building bringing everything up to code ensuring the safety of our guests and making sure the Retrocade sustains itself from opening day.</li>
<li>The gift for your contribution is more than a way for us to say thank you. It will allow you to enjoy your investement and experience why it's important.</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach our funding goal, the materials your contributions will make possible will put us ahead of schedule.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A new twist on a great idea</h3>
<p>This is our philosophy. Don't just buy some old machines for a few hundred dollars and line the walls of a building with games in dismay. Take the time to hunt down the classic machines that everyone really enjoys playing, repair and restore them to look and play like they were intended. Back that up with a fully emersive atmosphere to captivate the imagination of all ages with sights and sounds that will bring the building to life and provide a safe family friendly destination, that's what we will do.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have the talent and skills to complete this project so we combined our efforts and resources to do something either of us on our own could not have achieved. There are not many people who can repair these classics correctly.</li>
<li>In our lifetime, we have restored dozens of classic machines and will use all the experience we have brought to the table to really deliver the WOW Factor. This has really been a labor of love for us. Being veterans of the amusement industry we both feel a strong commitment to keep these games up and running for future generations to enjoy.</li>
<li>We just need a boost to get our doors open. It's for everyone in our community. For the gamers. For the World. We've both had the option to make more money. We've been there and done that. If we don't do this, we're going to regret it.</li>

<h3>Update: STRETCH GOAL! </h3>
<p></p>
<p>   We broke the $1000 funding goal in 4 hours! This is awesome. Thank you for your support!</p>
<p>   If we break $2500, then another weapon will be added to the game. After the campaign I will send a survey out to each backer to determine which weapon should be featured in the HEMA game expansion.</p>
<p>The choices will be:<br/>A. Dussack / Messer<br/>B. Singlestick <br/>C. Rapier <br/>D. Sword and Buckler</p>
<p>The Longsword part of the game will be finished first and released. The expansion will be released at a later date.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3> Our goal is to try and capture that good old SNES style and combine it with a combat system based on Historical European Martial Arts. Characters are based on real HEMA practitioners! Equipment is based on real HEMA gear! Fighting moves are based on real Longsword techniques!<br/><br/>
<h3>The Mirror Sword Combat System</h3>
<br/>   As a HEMA practitioner and a  retro game enthusiast, I have taken it upon myself to create a historically influenced combat system. I call this combat system ""The Mirror Sword System"". The Mirror Sword system is based on the Liechtenauer tradition of the late Medieval period. Use 3 guards, bind your opponent and use mastercuts. Button mashing will not help you here! To win you must learn to use the appropriate technique at the correct time. <br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>   I hope to release the game as a free game by Summer 2016 (Sooner if all goes well). Most of the art and design of the game is finished. However there is still alot of work needed to finish and polish the game. To make the Summer 2016 goal I will need at least $1000 to help fund development. <br/><br/>   We have some exciting backer rewards. For $35 I will make a pixel version of you and put you in the game! <br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>   The HEMA Longsword Tournament game is a test run for the Mirror Sword Combat System. If all goes well I will use this historically based combat system for a larger game in the future. <br/><br/>   Additionally I am active in a few online Indie Game Developer communities. I  hope to spread HEMA awareness to other Video Game Developers. As a video game enthusiast I am often let down by the lack of realism in video game combat systems.  HEMA is making bigger splashes in the entertainment world than ever before. Currently I can think of 3 other video games that incorporate some type of realism into their combat systems. I hope to help continue this trend!<br/><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>   Currently I am not a professional developer. I do this as a hobby and balance a full time job, a marriage and an obsession with HEMA. I will finish this project, but delays are possible. The amount of money I raise will help determine how quickly I can finish development. <br/><br/></p>

<p>Well Terrabeats is a music and rhythm based colourful game for mobile devices. My goal was to make a different and fun game with simple yet exciting design. I always thought that there are not enough games with an original idea and I thought maybe I could make a game that it's different than the others even if it's not much. So that's how I started making the Terrabeats and I'm really happy with the ongoing process.

</div></div>","What is Terrabeats ?
Well Terrabeats is a music and rhythm based colourful game for mobile devices. My goal was to make a different and fun game with simple yet exciting design. I always thought that there are not enough games with an original idea and I thought maybe I could make a game that it's different than the others even if it's not much. So that's how I started making the Terrabeats and I'm really happy with the ongoing process. But there are things that I can't deal alone and that's why I'm asking you to help me because when we go out and see a person playing this game we will all be proud that we were a part of making this game a reality.

<h3>WHAT IS EPICA REX?</h3>
<p>""Project Epica Rex"" (The working title, which very loosely means 'The King of Stories"") is a multiplayer sandbox RPG system.  It is not an MMO, but rather a multiplayer experience.  Each person who has a copy of Epica Rex will be able to join existing worlds, or run their very own world.  It is styled in  retro-2D pixel sprites using an isometric perspective.</p>
<p>Since players get to run their own worlds, the goals and situations upon each world are totally up to the owner of that server.</p>
<p>Players will be able to explore, adventure, collect, own land, build structures, form alliances, politic for control, and possibly go to war with others.  The possibilities are nearly endless.</p>
<p>Characters in Epica Rex will be able to select from a multitude of skills that will help them collect resources, craft and build, fight off threats or just make life easier.  Currently the list of skills is nearing about 220, which doesn't even include special abilities, spells or implants.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://epicarex.webs.com/ERPROMO/charline2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>DESIGN INFLUENCES</strong></p>
<p>Ultima Series, Ultima Online, Age of Wonders, Fallout Series, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, Dungeons of Dredmore (and many other roguelikes), Terraria</p>
<p><strong>ROGUELIKE</strong></p>
<p>Epica Rex will feature dungeons, labyrinths, caves, ruins, military bases, and defunct labs which are randomly generated much like any roguelike game.</p>
<p><strong>THE AGES</strong></p>
<p>Eventually Epica Rex will span four ages, which will be released as the game is developed further.</p>
<p>The Archaic Age : An age of low technology, and high magic.  The first of the four ages.</p>
<p>The Steam Age: Gadgetry, top hats, and gunpowder!  The second age to be developed.</p>
<p>The Modern Age: Introducing electricity and electronics, advanced weapons and building materials.</p>
<p>The Future Age: Lasers, Teleporters and Robotics.  The most advanced building materials are introduced.</p>
<p>Administrators of worlds will be able to pick and choose what they want out of any age, or enable or disable the specific features, skills and abilities.</p>
<p><strong>WORLDS AND EDITOR</strong></p>
<p>While the worlds are randomly generated, the game will feature a world editor where administrators can build the world they want to run!</p>

<h3>FUNDING BREAKDOWN</h3>
<p>The hope for Epica Rex is to release the first age, and thus the game by the end of 2013.  This is a tentitive date and depends on many factors.  Between now and then there will be a testing period.</p>

WHAT IS EPICA REX?
""Project Epica Rex"" (The working title, which very loosely means 'The King of Stories"") is a multiplayer sandbox RPG system.  It is not an MMO, but rather a multiplayer experience.  Each person who has a copy of Epica Rex will be able to join existing worlds, or run their very own world.  It is styled in  retro-2D pixel sprites using an isometric perspective.
Since players get to run their own worlds, the goals and situations upon each world are totally up to the owner of that server.
Players will be able to explore, adventure, collect, own land, build structures, form alliances, politic for control, and possibly go to war with others.  The possibilities are nearly endless.
Characters in Epica Rex will be able to select from a multitude of skills that will help them collect resources, craft and build, fight off threats or just make life easier.  Currently the list of skills is nearing about 220, which doesn't even include special abilities, spells or implants.

DESIGN INFLUENCES
Ultima Series, Ultima Online, Age of Wonders, Fallout Series, Dwarf Fortress, Minecraft, Dungeons of Dredmore (and many other roguelikes), Terraria
ROGUELIKE
Epica Rex will feature dungeons, labyrinths, caves, ruins, military bases, and defunct labs which are randomly generated much like any roguelike game.
THE AGES
Eventually Epica Rex will span four ages, which will be released as the game is developed further.
The Archaic Age : An age of low technology, and high magic.  The first of the four ages.
The Steam Age: Gadgetry, top hats, and gunpowder!  The second age to be developed.
The Modern Age: Introducing electricity and electronics, advanced weapons and building materials.
The Future Age: Lasers, Teleporters and Robotics.  The most advanced building materials are introduced.
Administrators of worlds will be able to pick and choose what they want out of any age, or enable or disable the specific features, skills and abilities.
WORLDS AND EDITOR
While the worlds are randomly generated, the game will feature a world editor where administrators can build the world they want to run!
 


FUNDING BREAKDOWN
The hope for Epica Rex is to release the first age, and thus the game by the end of 2013.  This is a tentitive date and depends on many factors.  Between now and then there will be a testing period.
The funding recieved will help:

Pay for entry onto Steam's Project Greenlight 
Pay for small account advertising
Legal and Copywright
Language Localization
Pay for music talent to add atmosphere to the game.
Pay for additional artists or programmers to come aboard
Pay for new equipment to test and develop the game with
Pay for further software development tools and aids
Pay for an official web site, its development and security
To help keep my focus on developing the game

What do you mean by ""YourGame""?
A large aim of the project is to have an open development process, and more importantly INVOLVE you guys with everything too. 



You can use our Subreddit to make suggestions on what you want within the game, feel free to join and post your suggestions!
https://www.reddit.com/r/OpusYourGame/

Here are some ideas for what you could contribute to the game:


Banners and icons for reddit, videos, websites etc.
Game ideas - Things that could go ingame such as items, mechanics etc.

How will the game work?
The aim is to implement a very free, open-world aspect to the game, allowing players to roam freely. With an expansive map, and a plethora of towns, cities, encampments, monster camps and so much more, there will be loads to do as you wonder around the game world.
Combat takes place in real-time, in an attempt to make the game even more immersive. As well as this, it will require some skill (utilising blocking and dodging and kiting).
The main storyline occurs in a somewhat investigative style - The player won't be told to go to an exact location and speak to a specific person. It is down to the player to track down the clues and investigate the plot that they have uncovered. The experience will be different for every player.
As for shops etc., Their wares will be random, and become better, the further the player has progressed in the game.

What will my funds go towards?Your funds will go towards three main things:
Upkeeping the website (and maintaining the website domain payments etc. )
Paying for private Github repositories for development.
Allowing us to 'reward' the amazing staff team that we have, since they are currently working on a voluntary basis.

<p>Somewhere along the way those types of games got forgotten and all we have now are strategy &amp; battle games with money hungry IAPs, one-tap games a monkey could play or yet-another-endless-runner (that rhymes). </p>
<p>To counter this, we at Flow Spark Studios are on a mission to bring back the charm and challenging gameplay of platformers to smartphones and tablets, and we need your help..</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Danger Rabbit is an homage to the platformers of yesteryear. It's big, fun and addictive, and features an innovative touchscreen gameplay mechanic that you'll love. You have to draw 'planks' at just the right angle and length to bounce Danger Rabbit past obstacles and enemies in more than 5 worlds and 100+ giant levels. So you will be bouncing through each level rather than jumping. </p>

</div></div>","Around 23 years ago when I was ten years old, video games were my passion and platformers in particular. I played them all day and soon I started inventing my own games, albeit on paper. Showing an early entrepreneurial trait, I created detailed level designs and drawings on paper for a game I invented and sent them to my favourite American game companies. They summarily rejected the ideas. Below is the first rejection letter I received: 




I couldn't quite afford a computer at the time (I was 10), so, undeterred, I designed another game and sent it off to a second gaming company. 



Both were rejected. So its something of a lifelong dream to build a game. Without further adieu, we introduce you to Danger Rabbit. 






Remember how much fun games like Super Mario and Sonic were?

Games back then were all about F-U-N. They were big, fun adventures with huge worlds to explore, different terrain to navigate and secret areas to discover. Games were vast and kept you entertained for weeks. They were challenging and hard to master, and beating them was an achievement to be proud of.

What happened to those games?


Somewhere along the way those types of games got forgotten and all we have now are strategy & battle games with money hungry IAPs, one-tap games a monkey could play or yet-another-endless-runner (that rhymes). 
To counter this, we at Flow Spark Studios are on a mission to bring back the charm and challenging gameplay of platformers to smartphones and tablets, and we need your help..


Danger Rabbit is an homage to the platformers of yesteryear. It's big, fun and addictive, and features an innovative touchscreen gameplay mechanic that you'll love. You have to draw 'planks' at just the right angle and length to bounce Danger Rabbit past obstacles and enemies in more than 5 worlds and 100+ giant levels. So you will be bouncing through each level rather than jumping. 




Can you master the art of drawing planks and making Danger Rabbit bounce just where you need him to go? Below is a gameplay trailer showing you how the art of drawing planks for Danger Rabbit works. 






So who are we? And how can you help? 
We are Flow Spark Studios, a small Australian gaming studio startup with a big passion for games. We want to make intelligent, original games designed for smartphones, tablets and eventually, consoles, PCs and Macs. 

Danger Rabbit is our first game. We have been working on Danger Rabbit for more than 18 months and we're now in the final stages of development. We need your help to bring Danger Rabbit to life and help bring back the magic of platform games to smartphones and tablets. We want to make Danger Rabbit bigger, badder and more awesome than even we imagined it could be, and we need your support. 

Not only that, we've reinvented platform games for touchscreen devices with a new gameplay mechanic that is fun and original.  






Not another endless runner, 
Not another strategy game filled with IAPs, 
Not another tower defense game, 
Not another retro one tap game a 2 year old could play.
Danger Rabbit is one big adventure from start to finish. Bounce Danger Rabbit through each level and collect carrots to unlock the next level and subsequent worlds for free. There are lots of fun power ups to collect throughout the game which adds variety to the gameplay.

On this stage of the production process we are able to change some things counting on your campaign feedback, please I read all your opinions don’t be shy.</p><p>Other reason for not seeing a very professional presentation is that our efforts are focused on making the best miniatures and is there where we expend all our time.</p><p> </p><p>Another very important detail.

This time with 3 teams at the same time!Why this time 3 team? , easy; managing a crowfunding campaign takes a lot of effort and time, I decided with my 2 year crowfunding experience that is better to make a big great campaign per year than several of 3 or 4 Moths ones.This gives me more time to ensure all is perfect (greens, casting and shipping). On your side more stretch goals will be unlocked making 3 teams at the same time and you won´t need to be alert the rest of the year for new surprise and fast campaigns. You won´t see here super pro and pretty look designed campaign with propainted models for a very good reason. This is a crowfunding not a preorder, the models you see here are first shot of the sculptor’s work. On this stage of the production process we are able to change some things counting on your campaign feedback, please I read all your opinions don’t be shy.Other reason for not seeing a very professional presentation is that our efforts are focused on making the best miniatures and is there where we expend all our time. Another very important detail. This campaign will be in both platforms; Kick Starter and Indiegogo. I am making this as a transition for making the next year’s project only on Kick Starter because people use to prefer it than Indiegogo.For not losing all the previous Indiegogo bakers I am making this double effort.Of course THE QUANTITY OF BOTH CAMPAIGNS WILL BE ADDED for unlocking new miniatures and TH Coins I strong suggest you to Like the Hungry Trolls FB for updates and follow Frangne Didier to see in real life timing of the Jurassic Team sculpting.https://www.facebook.com/Hungry-Troll-540034649355012/https://www.facebook.com/myfor  And here comes the candy, the miniatures:I will be adding a lot of photos in the gallery to show you every detail of all the miniatures.  Lizards, Jurassic TeamOne of the beast ideas I came up with is a Lizardmen team of dinosaurs.Very easy to difference between the saurus and the little ones.This team is going to be finish in few weeks but this is not a problem for timing because being sculpted by hand and doesn’t need to be printed as the 3D desings.  Norses, Fenrir  sonsA very well executed and representative miniatures for this team.These beer drinkers are the most representative miniatures of the norse background.    Chaos Dwarves, Kharlm Bastards As a result of an infidelity between a dwarf and a succubus these dwarf/demons come out.They have the same thirst as his brothers for bloodweiser but they like too slaving goblins and making demonic artefacts.  PERKS , what you get for your gold?:  Teams perk explanation: Jurassic Dinolizard team1 Spinogor - Kroxi6 Saurus10 Skinks (3 alternative heads) Markers set (turn, RR and ball)Numbers set (1-16)  ONE CROWFUNDING EXCLUSIVE FREE EXTRA SKINK!   FULL MINIATURE GALLERY:https://www.facebook.com/540034649355012/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1379406358751166  Fenrir sons 1 Yeti - Snow Troll2 Wolfmen2 Thrower2 Catcher2 Blitzer7 Linemen Markers set (turn, RR and ball)Numbers set (1-16)FULL MINIATURE GALLERY:https://www.facebook.com/540034649355012/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1379408772084258 Khralm Bastards 1 Minotaur2 Centaur6 Dwarf7 Goblin Markers set (turn, RR and ball)Numbers set (1-16) FULL MINIATURE GALLERY:https://www.facebook.com/Hungry-Troll-540034649355012/photos   Perk 1 Addoms:This perk is for taking separated miniatures.If you are already a funder or not and want to add more miniatures to your package take this perk and add the quantity of the miniature/s you are going to add. *If you have taken a full Jurassic team, Fenrir sons team or Kharim Bastards team the shipping will be free with the team. If you haven´t taken any of those teams the shipping will be calculate after the campaign ends depending on the total package weight. IMPORTANTIn case you want to add a basic miniature of the 3 teams it must be in metal. For example, you take a team of Fenrir sons in resin and you want to add an extra Linemen number 3, he will be supplied in metal.The reason for this is that resin teams have been ordered only as full 16 miniature teams for being able to offer them with this great low prices.(MODIFIED! : NOW YOU CAN TAKE EXTRA BASIC POSITIONAL FROM THE TEAMS IN BOTH MATERIALS) Only the unlocked minis will be casted in metal.  Perk 20 - 6 team pack:You can choose 6 of the 3 crowfunding teams in resin or metal or if you prefer even one the previous teams (Hungry Ogres [6 ogres, 11 snotling] or Plague Fields [14 miniatures team]). Every unlocked coin will count for 6 on this perk, for example if the total crowfundings amount is 10000€ you will have 6x2=12 coins to spend in extras.   Stretch goals: This time instead of getting one specific miniature/freebie you will get a Hungry Troll Coin.These coins can be change from any Hungry Troll Catalogue or new campaign miniatures. Here you have a table with all the miniatures by range of 1, 2 and 3 coins, depending on the miniatures size.When the campaign finished I will send you the pledge manager so you can choose the minis your prefer. IMPORTANTIn case you want to change HT Coins for a basic miniature of the 3 teams it must be in metal. For example, you take a team of Fenrir sons in resin and you want to add an extra Linemen number 3, he will be supplied in metal.The reason for this is that resin teams have been ordered only as full 16 miniature teams for being able to offer them with this great low prices.(MODIFIED! : NOW YOU CAN TAKE EXTRA BASIC POSITIONAL FROM THE TEAMS IN BOTH MATERIALS) Only the unlocked minis will be casted in metal.   ANTI BREXIT COINT!Do you live in the UK? then you will have a FREE COIN to use it in the 12 September crowfunding.Why I do this? Because with the Brexit the pound was devalued. United Kingdom is where BB was born and I know a lot of great costumers there. This is my way to compensate this non BB related event.        New campaign miniatures will be unlocked as the campaign gets more funds.   BOTH CAMPAIGNS INDIEGOGO/KICK STARTER will be added to unlock HT Coins and new miniatures.      Casting and quality materials:      I think no metal casting explanation is needed, you have seen the copies in previous campaign and Hungry Troll miniatures, the best of the best white metal. Big Child plastic resin casting.I discover some Months ago these cool guys live near my home and make a test ordering the miniature of the Freak Wars event, the Freak Warrior.I have seen the standing detail of resin in other companies and this one too. But what makes it different is the little flexibility that makes the miniature near to unbreakable. Very good news for FF players who use to over abuse our minis on the field.Resin will be only available for full team sets. During the campaign if a big model (big guy or little bigger) is unlocked we may see the possibility of casting it in resin. This time let me introduce you Big Child Creatives, resin casters of Black Sailors and most of the Cool Mini Or Not miniatures range among other renamed companies.For small resin casting we will make in GRx Creations, the company who casted Plague Fields.    Who is on this campaign? 4 Sculptors2 concept art designers3 casters1 sales manager There is a lot of people involve this time, just working for you to make the best miniatures  Pedro Ramos, PonchoAbilities: Hand Sculptor and illustratorDescription: Poncho is one of the most renamed Fantasy Bowl sculptors. He has sculpted more than 200 miniatures related to this game. If you have been in Fantasy Football no more words are needed. His knowledge sculpting BB miniatures and draws helped a lot Fancagne to make the Jurassic Team.Campaign : Jurassic team concept art and technical advice.www.ramos-gallery.blogspot.com Fancagne DidierAbilities: Hand SculptorDescription: Very skilled sculptor who has work for a lot of companies and has his own brand Kaha Miniatures. His skill sculpting semi human/animal and dinosaur miniatures catch my eye from the first time and decided that if Hungry Troll made a Lizardmen team should be him who sculpt it.Campaign : Jurassic team sculptorhttp://www.kahaminiatures.com/boutique/ Adrian Perez MontejanoAbilities: 3D SculptorDescription: Starting his company Lost Kingdom Miniatures just few Months ago he revealed a great skill sculpting chaos dwarfs. That is the reason to make his Medieval Fantasy Chaos Dwarf in to a BB team.Campaign : Chaos Dwarf Sculptor.https://www.facebook.com/LostKingdomMiniatures/ Raúl VillarealAbilities: Expert painter, Hand/3D Sculptor and IllustratorDescription: As in other campaigns Raul helps me a lot showing imagines form the miniatures and making resumes of for extras Perks and stretch goals that make fast and easier to see the campaign details.Campaign : 3D doc reviser/sculptor and  Illustrator  Juan Willke, VideadorAbilities: Crowfunding gold summonerDescription:  Hungry Troll owner. As I always say; -I am not a good sculptor, or painter or even don´t know well to play the game so what I can do for the BB world is to make miniatures for it- . Nothing makes me happier than having a miniature company and being able to live working on it.Campaign : Organize, shipping, respond emails, etc..

If we do not meet our goal here the Martin 202 cockpit will not be restored to the level it might otherwise have been. The restoration, such as it will be, will also be delayed. Other Ways You Can Help:Please get the word out to the airliner and aviation enthusiast community so we can reach our goal. Please also consider sharing the Martin 202 cockpit project through the IndiGoGo share tools.Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>We've Reached Full Funding!<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>We're going to do a full print! Thanks everyone! </strong>Let us start off by thanking everyone who has pledged onour campaign, we couldn't have done it without you! So, we now have reached full funding which is enough to print Series 1! Once we've printed and sent out all the decks to the contributors, we'll start selling on our website! Thanks again everyone!</p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We have enough for a partial print!<br/></strong></h3>
<strong>Hey everybody! Great news! </strong>We now have enough money for a partial print! We have raised enough that we can print out small quantities of all four decks! The more we print, the less each one costs, which is why we're trying to raise more funds, but as of now we do have enough to print when the campaign ends. If we can reach full funding, we can sell below $15 a deck once we print, so help us get there and make this a successful game! Thanks everyone and don't forget to spread the word!<br/><h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Awesome News!<br/></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Super Special Announcement! </strong>We've got something very awesome news! We're gonna be making a companion book to the Tails and Tactics Card Game! This book will outline a few things one should or should not do in the Tails and Tactics universe. The book will include funny anecdotes and even informatino about the behind-the-scenes of the Tails and Tactics Card Game. Without giving anything away, it's gonna be awesome!</p>
<p>Even better, the T&amp;T Companion Book will be given away free to anyone who donates at the $100 level or above! Want more good news? If we reach our goal right here on IndieGoGo, we'll give the book to everyone who donates at the $25 level and above! Once we start work on the book we'll post more about it, until then stay tuned! Special note, the book may ship seperate from the other perks, though we'll try our best to ship together.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>About The Project</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tails and Tactics</strong> is an exciting upcoming trading card game featuring light military strategy, good moves, and bad puns. With the support of Jan, the artist responsible for <a href=""http://www.tigerknight.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TigerKnight.com</a>, as well as funding from all of our generous backers, this project will be ready for printing in early 2013. Which is where you guys come in! With your support, we’ll be able to begin printing starter decks and finally release this game to the public!</p>
<p>The project goal is simple: we want to be able to print our decks professionally and distribute them! However many decks we can get printed with the money we raise will dictate how much we'll charge for the decks on our website. Our current goal is to be able to set the decks to sell for $15, but if we beat our goal we may be able to sell cheaper! The rewards for helping us out range from our thanks on the website, to free decks and rare cards, to having your very own character featured in the game! So, check out all the reward options, and help us get this game started!</p>

<h3 class=""template asset""><strong>Monetary Information</strong></h3>
<p>This is where the money will be going to! The biggest expense will be going toward the printing costs. Printing is expensive and we want to print as many decks as we possibly can. The more decks we can print, the cheaper each one is. The more money we raise, the less we'll charge for the decks! That's where the bulk of the money goes. Of course, we have bills associated with Tails and Tactics. We have recurring costs from running a website, hiring guest artists, advertising the project, many things. These bills have been paid so far by our staff, individual investors, and by donations on our website. We thank you all for your support!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A Brief History</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for Tails and Tactics was first conceived in October of 2011 by lead producer, Reynard Loustaunau. The search then began for artists crazy enough to contribute to the art of the game. Shortly afterwards, after discovering his style would suit the game perfectly, Jan joined the Tails and Tactics team as the Lead Artist. Since then, dozens upon dozens of cards have been designed and the game has gone through extensive play-testing thanks to the hard work of our testers and friends and one very tired printer. In addition, our website, <a href=""http://tailsandtactics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TailsandTactics.com</a>, is currently up! We've redesigned it and are still working to better it as is needed. Tails and Tactics is scheduled to start professional printing in early 2013.</p>

<h2><strong>Come on, another strategy game?</strong></h2>
<p>Well yes. And no. It depends on your perspective. What really happens is,  we have grown bored of the many easy-to-play designs, games that require more luck than skill or come with a single ‘way to victory’ solution. When we speak about “strategy games”, those words have a serious meaning.</p>
<p>We are four friends, coming out of the dissatisfied players segment to work for it. We are also gamers for the last 20 years, very experienced,  but still very enthusiastic. We appeal to the strategy gamer who wants a challenge. One who does not need to learn the game in 5 minutes, and who can plan actions with long term effects. One who prefers the unpredictability of human opponents over artificial intelligence. One who enjoys a historic atmosphere as a background for his game, and loves to see events unfold in either a similar or a very different way that what really happened.</p>
<p>We are passionate professionals who made job of our hobby. We also have full time jobs, but work on this project during nights and weekends. We have created a small firm and dream on making strategy games for the market segment that wants something more. Should this project succeeds more will follow. Sleep is overrated, we can live without it!</p>
<p>And we are not ‘thinking about it’. We have already started it, and with your help, we will see it through. </p>
<p><em>(Players Hall of Fame)</em></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Player's Hall of Fame"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i198.photobucket.com/albums/aa264/silver77_album/EaW1805/hall_of_fame.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Ok then. What is it about?</strong></h2>
<p>Empires at war 1805 is a historical strategy game that simulates certain aspects of European history during the Napoleonic era starting in 1805. Each player takes on the role of the national leader of one of the seventeen predominate nations of the era, controlling diplomacy, economy, warfare and colonization. The game takes place on a map divided into four areas, the large one depicting Europe, and the other three the different colonial theaters of war. </p>
<p>You need a web browser and an internet connection to play, but nothing to download and install. Orders will be inputted by the players through the game’s User Interface at their own leisure until the processing deadline, (that can range depending on player preference, during beta it is weekly)  These orders will be simultaneously processed and the results made readily available on the website. </p>
<p>Players have a variety of options on how to play and where to expand, but remember this is an era of warfare. Sooner or later your interests with conflict those of another player, and wars will break up. Maintaining a strong economy, a reasonable army, remaining well connected with friends &amp; allies, while carefully choosing when to campaign and when to remain peaceful are all factors that separate your nation from victory or catastrophe. Each action taken results in a collection of “victory points” which will eventually determine the winners of each game.</p>

<h2><strong>So what you need us for?</strong></h2>
<p>Dedication, passion and professionalism are all traits needed for a successful project. But there is something more that is needed – resources. As a new firm, we are very low on that… in fact we have already used up our starting capital for the preliminary stages of the project. Apart from us, there are about 8 more people who have worked or are working on various parts of the project - artists, musicians, programmers or web designers, and they need to be paid for their services.</p>
<p>Some people pointed out that it would be simpler and faster to get a small loan from a bank for the expenses and carry on. But thinking about it – why the hell should we pay a bank for any profit we might make? This is a project for gamers, and should come from gamers. Likewise, any rewards should also go back to them. Check out our perks and you will see what we mean. We don’t want donations. We want active participants, we want happy customers. Everything we make should go back to you in one way or another. </p>
<p>So we appeal to you for support in finishing this project. Your help, regardless how small it is, will be invaluable to us not only as a resource, but also as a morale boost that there is a community here to back us up. Supporting us will not save the whales, nor stop the global warming… we are only making a game. But we are good at it, and given half a chance, we will for sure make some people more happy when its over. </p>

<h3>Can we improve our game position by paying? </h3>
<p>No. Although this is a quite popular technique in browser games, we hardly think this will make EaW1805 a proper wargame. Only your decisions will influence the power of your position, you cannot spend real life money to improve it. Would chess game be the same if you could spend $$ to buy an extra Queen?</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>So what do we do during a game turn? </h3>
<p>There is a variety of things you can do in a game turn.</p>
<p>First of all, usually you will read the game newsletter. It is in the form of a newspaper, and will have news from around the world, as well as player announcements. Each newsletter is player-specific and not the same for all : Your country's own news will be the headline, news from other countries are secondary. </p>
<p>Next can see the reports about your economy, trading, or battles if you have any. Diplomatic messages you need not wait your turn to read them, they arrive immediately to your website account. </p>
<p>Once you have looked over everything that interests you, it is time for decision making. Basically you can spend your resources towards 2 main directions</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving your economy (eg build new production sites, increase population, trading)</li>
<li>Improve your armed forces (eg build new troops, train or upgrade existing ones, build new ships, build fortresses)</li>
</ul><p>Finding the correct balance between these two conflicting directions is one of the decisions you have to make in the game.</p>
<p>Once this is done, perhaps it is organising &amp; movement time: You can organise your ships and brigades into Fleets and Corps respectively, and then Corps into Armies. You can therefore move larger bodies of troops with less effort, maybe use smaller and more mobile armies for faster expansion, or very large ones for battles. Again, how you organise your forces is up to you, but it will have an effect in the game. </p>
<p>Apart from the players, there will be neutral territories at the start of the game, especially in the colonies and north Africa. Feel free to go for them, the more you have the merrier. Some will require some planning (for example build a Colonial Brigade, train it, load it to a fleet, send it to the colonies) but it will be worth it. </p>
<p>Your commanders, spies, merchant ships, baggage trains, are also moveable forces - use them as you see fit for trading, spying, or preparing an invasion. </p>
<p>The above will take most of the turn managment, but there are other management options for players to consider like the Politics screen (change relations with other nations, make alliances, declare wars) the Taxation screen (change taxes, invest goods in the economy) or Newsletter panel (writting eponymous or anonymous propaganda). </p>
<p>The UI allows you the option to partially do your turn, then reload and change it some other time before the deadline.</p>

Well yes. And no. It depends on your perspective. What really happens is,  we have grown bored of the many easy-to-play designs, games that require more luck than skill or come with a single ‘way to victory’ solution. When we speak about “strategy games”, those words have a serious meaning.
We are four friends, coming out of the dissatisfied players segment to work for it. We are also gamers for the last 20 years, very experienced,  but still very enthusiastic. We appeal to the strategy gamer who wants a challenge. One who does not need to learn the game in 5 minutes, and who can plan actions with long term effects. One who prefers the unpredictability of human opponents over artificial intelligence. One who enjoys a historic atmosphere as a background for his game, and loves to see events unfold in either a similar or a very different way that what really happened.
We are passionate professionals who made job of our hobby. We also have full time jobs, but work on this project during nights and weekends. We have created a small firm and dream on making strategy games for the market segment that wants something more. Should this project succeeds more will follow. Sleep is overrated, we can live without it!
And we are not ‘thinking about it’. We have already started it, and with your help, we will see it through. 
(Players Hall of Fame)
 
Ok then. What is it about?
Empires at war 1805 is a historical strategy game that simulates certain aspects of European history during the Napoleonic era starting in 1805. Each player takes on the role of the national leader of one of the seventeen predominate nations of the era, controlling diplomacy, economy, warfare and colonization. The game takes place on a map divided into four areas, the large one depicting Europe, and the other three the different colonial theaters of war. 
You need a web browser and an internet connection to play, but nothing to download and install. Orders will be inputted by the players through the game’s User Interface at their own leisure until the processing deadline, (that can range depending on player preference, during beta it is weekly)  These orders will be simultaneously processed and the results made readily available on the website. 
Players have a variety of options on how to play and where to expand, but remember this is an era of warfare. Sooner or later your interests with conflict those of another player, and wars will break up. Maintaining a strong economy, a reasonable army, remaining well connected with friends & allies, while carefully choosing when to campaign and when to remain peaceful are all factors that separate your nation from victory or catastrophe. Each action taken results in a collection of “victory points” which will eventually determine the winners of each game.

Apart from us, there are about 8 more people who have worked or are working on various parts of the project - artists, musicians, programmers or web designers, and they need to be paid for their services.
Some people pointed out that it would be simpler and faster to get a small loan from a bank for the expenses and carry on. But thinking about it – why the hell should we pay a bank for any profit we might make? This is a project for gamers, and should come from gamers. Likewise, any rewards should also go back to them.

<p>Game For a Cure is a (soon to be) non-profit organization that is striving to touch the lives of thousands of people through the video game community. We started back in early 2010, with an idea to host an online tournament with all proceeds going directly to cancer research.</p>
<p>Our first tournament was a free-to-enter Halo 3 1v1 tournament. Why did we choose to make the tournament free-to-enter? We were a brand new organization and we understood that people weren't going to give money to someone / an organization without actual proof as to where their money was going.</p>
<p>Our second tournament was also on Halo 3, but this time it was a 4v4 game. We had 8 teams register at $20/team. Prizes, in the form of Xbox Live points, were donated by a local company so that none of the money raised was used to purchase prizes.</p>
<h2>Who started it?</h2>
<p>Game For a Cure was founded by Kyle Sullivan in March 2010; his passion for cancer and finding a cure was originally ignited in 2001 when his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully, the treatment at the time was enough to help significantly, and we’re pleased to note that she has just recently finished taking the necessary post-cancer drugs.</p>
<h2>Why do we need your help?</h2>
<p>Over the past 2 years, we've attempted to host more tournaments but ran into an issue: people were finding it hard to trust us without us being an actual non-profit organization. With your help, we are looking to change that so we can move on to achieve bigger and better things.</p>
<h2>Why are we asking for $3000?</h2>
<p>In Ontario it costs about $1100 to register a non-profit organization. So what will we do with the extra $1900?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for all the awesome perks we're giving away for your contribution</li>
<li>The remainder will go into an organization bank account, and used for future tournament prizes &amp; giveaways</li>
<li>Indigogo takes 4% if we raise the $3000 and 9% if we don't</li>
</ul><h2>The Future of Game For a Cure</h2>
<p>Over time we'd love to do more things than just game tournaments. Here are a few things that our team has thrown up in the air if we ever got the amount of funding to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li>An annual MLG type event, hosted in different cities across North America, with all proceeds going to cancer research</li>
<li>Room transformations - We'd be on the lookout for gamers who are in post-cancer treatment and totally transform their room into the most high-tech gaming room possible</li>
<li>Mobile gaming devices to be given out to children &amp; teens who are in hospitals for long terms</li>
</ul><p>With your help we believe that we can achieve all of this and more! So even the smallest donation is not treated as such and we thank you for anything that you can afford to give to us.</p>

In Ontario it costs about $1100 to register a non-profit organization. So what will we do with the extra $1900?

Pay for all the awesome perks we're giving away for your contribution
The remainder will go into an organization bank account, and used for future tournament prizes & giveaways
Indigogo takes 4% if we raise the $3000 and 9% if we don't
The Future of Game For a Cure
Over time we'd love to do more things than just game tournaments. Here are a few things that our team has thrown up in the air if we ever got the amount of funding to do so.

An annual MLG type event, hosted in different cities across North America, with all proceeds going to cancer research
Room transformations - We'd be on the lookout for gamers who are in post-cancer treatment and totally transform their room into the most high-tech gaming room possible
Mobile gaming devices to be given out to children & teens who are in hospitals for long terms
With your help we believe that we can achieve all of this and more! So even the smallest donation is not treated as such and we thank you for anything that you can afford to give to us.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What is Dismal Survival?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Dismal Survival is a first person, or third person, <strong>exploration survival video game experience</strong>, designed with <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>. There are no zombies or cannibals - Only you, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. Dismal Survival will make you struggle to survive the cold, the rain, the snow, the tough changing of seasons, and the ocean storms. Manage your hunger, thirst, tiredness and mental health. Craft your raft and explore an endlessly generated islands from a few meters square up to 32 km square. Craft your tools and build a shelters. Start a fire to cook and to keep warm during the cold nights. Fish, harvest and gather resources. Fight against Chimeras and Gods during your dreams to regain lost memories and to gain new skills.</p>
<p>Dismal Survival is a touching experience. <strong>Freedom, Immersion, Exploration and Dreams</strong> are the key words. You will be transported into a world where the Spirit and Soul are acting like Bridges with the Outside World. Dismal Survival is <strong>inspired by Subsistence, Stranded Deep, The Forest, and The Long Dark games</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What is the game story?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A father and his little daughter were in a terrible car accident on their way to the airport to pick up the mother. The <strong>father survived</strong> the car crash but had to be put into a <strong>deep coma</strong> following a cardiac arrest. His <strong>little daughter</strong> sadly <strong>passed away</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597765096/fkow3acev2xvp7wcfdbx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The islands and all the survival are all in the father head as he is in a deep coma. The dad refuses to believe that his little girl is dead and he is looking for her. Somehow, he knows she's still alive somewhere. He finally found some peace in a small abandoned church hidden somewhere on one of the islands ... a snowy mountain ... as soon as he entered the small abandoned church, he admitted that she died following the car accident and that she is now in heaven. At the same time, he finally wakes up from his deep coma and feels his little girl's hand in his. The little girl whispers to him that this is time for her to go home. The <strong>father</strong> also <strong>realises</strong> that his <strong>wife</strong> standing in front of his hospital bed is <strong>pregnant</strong>. What choice will he make? <strong>To give up</strong> and follow his little girl in heaven <strong>or</strong> to continue <strong>to survive</strong> this time in the real world ... without his little angel.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>How big is the game world?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>VERY BIG!</strong> The game world is composed of <strong>MANY islands themselves composed of four island types</strong> - <strong>Continental</strong> (that includes; huge forests; large beaches of sand; dunes and deserts; small canyons; open plains; waterfalls; lakes and rivers), <strong>Oceanic</strong> (that includes; old volcanic mountains and high plains), <strong>Volcanic</strong> (that includes; high snow capped mountains and sharp mountain peaks) and <strong>Archipelagos</strong> (that includes; group of curved beaches; collection of small and scattered islands) - of 16 square kilometres each, separated by a <strong>huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour</strong>. Expect many ocean storms as well as both small and high unpredictable waves with rapid transition from deep to shallow water. The last thing you want is a drifting raft that you watch it drift away during an ocean storm because your raft was poorly built. Make it strong and always be mindful of the direction of the wind!</p>
<ul>
<li>Many <strong>island</strong> types <strong>of 16 square kilometres each</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Huge dynamic</strong> real time <strong>ocean with wind</strong> behaviour.</li>
<li>
<strong>480 square kilometres to explore</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The YouTube video below - Lengthy Aerial View - will give you a good idea about the size of the islands.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>The YouTube video below - Ocean Physics Skyline - will give you a good idea about the size of the ocean and how long does it takes to reach an island starting from the middle of two islands.</strong></p>

<p>To give you an exact idea, consider that <strong>each pixel of the four island maps shown below is 16 square metres</strong> (this is proportionally calculated by taking into account the resolution of the continental island map shown below is 1024 x 1024 compared to the ratio of the original 8192 x 8192 height map that is of 16 square kilometres).</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Did you said a huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TRUE! Below a YouTube video showcasing the Ocean Physics</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aUHCsWKayPY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>To design a huge <strong>dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour</strong>, you must <strong>understand how wind and waves operate</strong>. You need to ask yourself the following two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a wave?</li>
<li>How the wind forms a wave?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A <strong>wave is</strong> a source of <strong>energy</strong>. The connection between wind and waves is obvious. The waves develop regularly in amplitude up to a level of saturation which depends on the <strong>force of</strong> the <strong>wind</strong>. When the wind stops blowing, the waves gradually break down. As waves are energy, this therefore can also be understood with a <strong>mathematical equation</strong>.</p>
<p>Ocean waves behave according to the depth of the water they have formed in. Generally, we consider deep water when the water has a depth larger than half a wavelength, which is usually the case in the open ocean. We know for a fact that; (<strong>1</strong>) in deep water the velocity of a wave through water is determined by the wavelength; (<strong>2</strong>) the longer waves are moving faster; (<strong>3</strong>) a wave speed is the distance travelled by a given point on the wave in a given interval of time (for example, in an equation form, if a wave moves a distance of 20 meters in 10 seconds, then the speed of the wave is 2.0 m/s); (<strong>4</strong>) in shallow water the velocity of a wave is determined by the water depth; (<strong>5</strong>) when a deep water wave moves into shallow water it slows down.</p>
<p>With all those information taken into account, and also with some serious Google searches, we can translate those <strong>information</strong> with a <strong>material</strong> directly in Unreal Engine 4. This has taken some time but the result is more than satisfying and gives solid base for render improvements.</p>
<p>In another words, the graphic aspect of the current waves shown in the YouTube video below will improve even more in the future game versions.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Real Time Shifting Seasons</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The video below presents three different views of a shifting seasons of 10 months from the 1st April to the 31st January, which is exactly 306 game days, or exactly 712 hours played (1 game day is 2 hours). Spring covers a period from March 1 to May 31 (92 game days or 184 hours played); Summer covers a period from June 1 to August 31 (92 game days or 184 hours played); Autumn covers a period from September 1 to November 30 (91 game days or 182 hours played); and Winter covers a period from December 1 to February 28 (90 game days or 180 hours played). <strong>A full year is exactly 365 game days or 730 hours played.</strong> This is still a work in progress.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class=""""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMHZdpELNPg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Will Dismal Survival be regularly updated?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DEFINITELY!</strong> The current development includes <strong>a start of 12 islands of 16 square kilometres each</strong>; this is <strong>192 square kilometres</strong> without counting the huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour which is about <strong>288 square kilometres</strong>. So <strong>we are talking about 480 square kilometres to explore</strong>. Dismal Survival is also designed in a way that allows MANY MORE islands to be easily added. The process design of the islands are generated directly with <strong>World Machine 3 Professional</strong> and <strong>Geo Glyph</strong> to be finally imported directly in <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>. This process make it possible to have literally speaking an unlimited number of islands.</p>
<p>The idea behind this is to allow the player to select certain parameters such as the island size, shape, elevation, number of trees and rocks (an island generator in future game versions). Each adventure is composed of 12 main islands including the ocean. In another words, your life is too short to discover out everything.</p>
<p><strong>Below a YouTube video showcasing the Generated Islands Design</strong> - G.I.D - process with World Machine 3 Professional and Geo Glyph before being imported directly in Unreal Engine 4. Unlimited possibilities for an unlimited number of Archipelagos, Continental, Oceanic, and Volcanic islands.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What type of landscapes will I explore?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There is <strong>four island types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Continental island </strong>that includes; huge forests; large beaches of sand; dunes and deserts; small canyons; open plains; waterfalls; lakes and rivers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Oceanic island </strong>that includes; old volcanic mountains and high plains.</li>
<li>
<strong>Volcanic island </strong>that includes; high snow capped mountains and sharp mountain peaks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Archipelagos island </strong>that includes; group of curved beaches; collection of small and scattered islands.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Below this YouTube video showcases a new type of landscape - Crater Island - during the tough winter seasons using a Natural Placement Based on Angular Coordinates (NPBAC) that I designed and shaped with World Machine 3 Professional and GeoGlyph.</strong> This NPBAC process (X and Y axes placed accordingly with the Z axis) makes landscape scenes even more realistic, especially with the tree placement, erosion, and snow processes. In this video, we can easily see the natural HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting effect as well as the effects of snow and the effects of blizzard.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VqFlXpbvi8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Also <strong>between each island types</strong> will be a <strong>lot of very small and small islands</strong>, from few square meters to few hundreds square meters. <i>I heard that there is an one square meter island with only one tree somewhere lost in the huge ocean, with a treasure to get - one old story talks about an old pirate weapons - will you find it?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What will I be able to craft?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>By <strong>cutting trees and gathering resources</strong>, you will be able to craft items by using the Menu Inventory System - M.I.S - that has been designed to offer a <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>effective</strong>, and <strong>fast</strong> approach to meet the player needs; as follow: An <strong>Axe</strong> (to cut trees); A <strong>Hatchet</strong> (to cut and split wood); A <strong>Knife</strong> (to cut animal meats); A <strong>Iron Pan</strong> (to cook); A <strong>hammer</strong> (to drive nails into wood and to shape metal); A <strong>sledgehammer</strong> (to break stones and rocks); A <strong>Bow and Arrows</strong> (to hunt); A <strong>Raft</strong> (to move from island to island); A <strong>Wooden​ Water Collector</strong> (to wash your hands and to drink); A <strong>Fire</strong> (to keep warm); A <strong>Metal Foundry</strong> (to build a metal shelter); A <strong>Bed</strong> (to save and load your game progress); A <strong>Wood Shelter</strong> (to have a second type base); and A <strong>Metal Shelter</strong> (to have a first type base). <i>This crafting list will be extended with more craftable props in future game versions.</i></p>
<p><strong>Below a YouTube video and a picture showcasing the following craftable props; Axes; Hatchets; Knifes; Iron Pans; and Wooden Water Collectors.</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What types of shelters can I build?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A <strong>Wood Shelter</strong> (to have a second type base) and A <strong>Metal Shelter</strong> (to have a first type base). The player can build almost anywhere on the landscape except under water and on a land with an angle more than 45 degrees. The player will be able to <strong>build any shelters by cutting trees and gathering resources</strong>. Make sure you got an axe (to cut trees), a hatchet (to cut and split wood), and a hammer (to drive nails into wood and to shape metal).</p>
<p><strong>The YouTube video and screenshots below are showing different configuration of shelters.</strong></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Which conditions will make the player to die?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You have to manage your <strong>hunger</strong>, <strong>thirst</strong>, <strong>cold</strong> and <strong>tiredness</strong> if you want to survive. The winters are very cold so you better be well prepared. Also the <strong>wildlife animals</strong> are a <strong>BIG THREATS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bald eagles</strong> can definitely attack the player, but the injuries inflicted are not lethal. During mating seasons, bald eagles become much more territorial; this is best to keep a safe distance from a bald eagle and to respect the bird's space.</p>
<p><strong>Cougars</strong> may attack if cornered and if the player keep running, this might stimulates the cougar instinct to chase. Same if the player stop moving for a long time. Standing still however may cause the cougar to consider the player an easy prey.</p>
<p><strong>Bears</strong> are rare. This is highly recommended that the player don't unwittingly attract them. If the player decide to kill a bear, you better be extremely well prepared. Even the player shelter might not be the safest place against bear attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Bison</strong> are among the most dangerous animals that the player can encountered and will attack the player if provoked. They appear slow because of their lethargic movements, but can easily outrun the player, even running at full speed. Be prepared to run fast!</p>
<p><strong>Moose</strong> are not usually aggressive towards the player, but can be provoked or frightened to behave with aggression. They will attack the player more than bears and wolves combined, but usually with only minor consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Elk</strong> are able to attack the player using strong legs and sharp hooves. The reason for a sudden aggression is to protect their small ones.</p>
<p><strong>Coyote</strong> attacks on the player are uncommon and rarely will cause serious injuries, mainly due to rabies.</p>
<p><strong>Wolf</strong> attacks against the player will occur only by healthy wolves. However this will remains as rare and unusual events. Remember that even healthy wolves dislike fire and smoke because it appears dangerous to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>How long is a full day/night cycle in game?</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>sources of light</strong> in Dismal Survival are <strong>the sun</strong> during the day and <strong>the moon</strong> during the night. The sun is rising from the east and is setting in the west. A <strong>full day/night cycle</strong> in game is exactly <strong>60 minutes</strong>. So if you play 4 hours surviving, you survived 4 game days. All the islands are designed from a square pyramid shape. This method always shows beautiful stunning views from any high point. This is also a natural process of any landscape - mountain based. From a bird side view, the views are looking super realistic. The <strong>position</strong> of the <strong>sun</strong> and the <strong>moon</strong> in the <strong>sky</strong> are also an indicator of <strong>time</strong>. The <strong>lighting from the sun and the moon are impacting on the surface landscape</strong>. Also the <strong>shadows of the clouds in the atmosphere are directly reflected on the surface landscape</strong>. This <strong>lighting processes</strong> contribute to a <strong>realistic wind effects</strong> that can be seen <strong>on the moving flora</strong> as well as <strong>on the ocean waves</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The YouTube video below shows an extract periods of sunrise and of sunset recorded in real time directly from the editor of Unreal Engine 4.</strong> <i>For video purposes, the extract periods of sunrise and of sunset have been accelerated by a factor of 10.</i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Real Atmospheric Depth</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I passed a lot of time to <strong>design</strong> and <strong>simulate</strong> a <strong>Real Atmospheric Depth</strong> in <strong>real time</strong> according to the sun position. I was able to manage this by <strong>combining</strong> a <strong>Real Depth of Field</strong> and a <strong>Real Atmospheric Lighting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The YouTube video below - Long Sunset Walk - show (1) a Real Depth of Field and (2) a Real Atmospheric Lighting. When both effects are combined, the result is (1) + (2) a Real Atmospheric Depth. This effect also give an idea about the real size of the islands.</strong></p>

</div></div>","What is Dismal Survival?
 
Dismal Survival is a first person, or third person, exploration survival video game experience, designed with Unreal Engine 4. There are no zombies or cannibals - Only you, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. Dismal Survival will make you struggle to survive the cold, the rain, the snow, the tough changing of seasons, and the ocean storms. Manage your hunger, thirst, tiredness and mental health. Craft your raft and explore an endlessly generated islands from a few meters square up to 32 km square. Craft your tools and build a shelters. Start a fire to cook and to keep warm during the cold nights. Fish, harvest and gather resources. Fight against Chimeras and Gods during your dreams to regain lost memories and to gain new skills.
Dismal Survival is a touching experience. Freedom, Immersion, Exploration and Dreams are the key words. You will be transported into a world where the Spirit and Soul are acting like Bridges with the Outside World. Dismal Survival is inspired by Subsistence, Stranded Deep, The Forest, and The Long Dark games.
 

What is the game story?
 
A father and his little daughter were in a terrible car accident on their way to the airport to pick up the mother. The father survived the car crash but had to be put into a deep coma following a cardiac arrest. His little daughter sadly passed away.

The islands and all the survival are all in the father head as he is in a deep coma. The dad refuses to believe that his little girl is dead and he is looking for her. Somehow, he knows she's still alive somewhere. He finally found some peace in a small abandoned church hidden somewhere on one of the islands ... a snowy mountain ... as soon as he entered the small abandoned church, he admitted that she died following the car accident and that she is now in heaven. At the same time, he finally wakes up from his deep coma and feels his little girl's hand in his. The little girl whispers to him that this is time for her to go home. The father also realises that his wife standing in front of his hospital bed is pregnant. What choice will he make? To give up and follow his little girl in heaven or to continue to survive this time in the real world ... without his little angel.
 
""Dismal Survival is a touching experience. Freedom, Immersion, Exploration and Dreams are the key words. Get ready to be transported into a world where the Spirit and Soul are acting like Bridges with the Outside World.""
 
When will I be able to play Dismal Survival?
 
A very first version of the game is planned to be released as an alpha early March 2021. Unlike other project, Dismal Survival will be released for the community in whatever development stage it will be when early March 2021 arrives.

For the 1.0 game version, we are talking years. However, I started the development of this project about 3 months ago and in early August 2020 I was able to program and ship a demo in less than three days to a French YouTuber named Soma Gaming - https://www.youtube.com/c/SomaGaming77 - for a testing and promotional video purposes. Subscribe and Check it out!
 


Who is working on the game?
 
The game is designed and developed by a virtual company - D R O P P E D D E A DG A M E S - http://droppeddeadgames.xyz/ - with more than 15 years of experience and know-how, including numerous contributions for famous video games after release, with maps and textures for; Phosphor 3D; Fatal Furries; Doom 3; Quake 3 Arena; Shadow Man; Turok Dinosaur Hunter; Turok 2 Seeds of Evil.


Gaël ROMANET is the Creator of Dismal Survival - http://dismalsurvival.games/ - He is also the Lead Visual Designer and Texture Artist of the project.

Alessandro SAINI - https://www.alessandrosaini.com/ - He is the first to join the team as the Lead Composer and Musical Ambiences of Dismal Survival. His numerous contributions as a Composer for Films, TV, and Video Games including; Borderlands 2; Darksiders III; Dauntless; The Long Dark.

Marco VENITUCCI - https://www.artstation.com/marco_venitucci - He is the second to join the team as the Lead Concept Artist of Dismal Survival. He is in charge of the Dreams aspects of the game (Invitation to Fight against Chimeras and Gods during your dreams...)

 

How big is the game world?
 
VERY BIG! The game world is composed of MANY islands themselves composed of four island types - Continental (that includes; huge forests; large beaches of sand; dunes and deserts; small canyons; open plains; waterfalls; lakes and rivers), Oceanic (that includes; old volcanic mountains and high plains), Volcanic (that includes; high snow capped mountains and sharp mountain peaks) and Archipelagos (that includes; group of curved beaches; collection of small and scattered islands) - of 16 square kilometres each, separated by a huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour. Expect many ocean storms as well as both small and high unpredictable waves with rapid transition from deep to shallow water. The last thing you want is a drifting raft that you watch it drift away during an ocean storm because your raft was poorly built. Make it strong and always be mindful of the direction of the wind!

Many island types of 16 square kilometres each.

Huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour.

480 square kilometres to explore!

 
The YouTube video below - Lengthy Aerial View - will give you a good idea about the size of the islands.
 

 
The YouTube video below - Ocean Physics Skyline - will give you a good idea about the size of the ocean and how long does it takes to reach an island starting from the middle of two islands.
 

 
To give you an exact idea, consider that each pixel of the four island maps shown below is 16 square metres (this is proportionally calculated by taking into account the resolution of the continental island map shown below is 1024 x 1024 compared to the ratio of the original 8192 x 8192 height map that is of 16 square kilometres).
Example below of the Continental Island map type: that includes; huge forests; large beaches of sand; dunes and deserts; small canyons; open plains; waterfalls; lakes and rivers.
 

 
Example below of the Oceanic Island map type: that includes; old volcanic mountains and high plains.
 

 
Example below of the Volcanic Island map type: that includes; high snow capped mountains and sharp mountain peaks.
 

 
Example below of the Archipelagos Island map type: that includes; group of curved beaches; collection of small and scattered islands.
 

 
Did you said a huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour?
 
TRUE! Below a YouTube video showcasing the Ocean Physics.
 

 
To design a huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour, you must understand how wind and waves operate. You need to ask yourself the following two questions:

What is a wave?
How the wind forms a wave?

 
A wave is a source of energy. The connection between wind and waves is obvious. The waves develop regularly in amplitude up to a level of saturation which depends on the force of the wind. When the wind stops blowing, the waves gradually break down. As waves are energy, this therefore can also be understood with a mathematical equation.
Ocean waves behave according to the depth of the water they have formed in. Generally, we consider deep water when the water has a depth larger than half a wavelength, which is usually the case in the open ocean. We know for a fact that; (1) in deep water the velocity of a wave through water is determined by the wavelength; (2) the longer waves are moving faster; (3) a wave speed is the distance travelled by a given point on the wave in a given interval of time (for example, in an equation form, if a wave moves a distance of 20 meters in 10 seconds, then the speed of the wave is 2.0 m/s); (4) in shallow water the velocity of a wave is determined by the water depth; (5) when a deep water wave moves into shallow water it slows down.
With all those information taken into account, and also with some serious Google searches, we can translate those information with a material directly in Unreal Engine 4. This has taken some time but the result is more than satisfying and gives solid base for render improvements.
In another words, the graphic aspect of the current waves shown in the YouTube video below will improve even more in the future game versions.
 

 
Real Time Shifting Seasons
 
The video below presents three different views of a shifting seasons of 10 months from the 1st April to the 31st January, which is exactly 306 game days, or exactly 712 hours played (1 game day is 2 hours). Spring covers a period from March 1 to May 31 (92 game days or 184 hours played); Summer covers a period from June 1 to August 31 (92 game days or 184 hours played); Autumn covers a period from September 1 to November 30 (91 game days or 182 hours played); and Winter covers a period from December 1 to February 28 (90 game days or 180 hours played). A full year is exactly 365 game days or 730 hours played. This is still a work in progress.
 

 
Will Dismal Survival be regularly updated?
 
DEFINITELY! The current development includes a start of 12 islands of 16 square kilometres each; this is 192 square kilometres without counting the huge dynamic real time ocean with wind behaviour which is about 288 square kilometres. So we are talking about 480 square kilometres to explore. Dismal Survival is also designed in a way that allows MANY MORE islands to be easily added. The process design of the islands are generated directly with World Machine 3 Professional and Geo Glyph to be finally imported directly in Unreal Engine 4. This process make it possible to have literally speaking an unlimited number of islands.
The idea behind this is to allow the player to select certain parameters such as the island size, shape, elevation, number of trees and rocks (an island generator in future game versions). Each adventure is composed of 12 main islands including the ocean. In another words, your life is too short to discover out everything.
Below a YouTube video showcasing the Generated Islands Design - G.I.D - process with World Machine 3 Professional and Geo Glyph before being imported directly in Unreal Engine 4. Unlimited possibilities for an unlimited number of Archipelagos, Continental, Oceanic, and Volcanic islands.
 

 
Below a YouTube video showcasing My Macro ""Photography Texture 3D"" designed for DISMAL Survival using World Machine 3 Professional that allows you to transform any photography to a perfect seamless texture up to 16K BY KEEPING 100% of all pixels from the photography. Also, my Macro ""Photography Texture 3D"" allows you to transform any perfect seamless texture to a perfect seamless heightmap up to a resolution of 16384 x 16384.
 

 
What type of landscapes will I explore?
 
There is four island types:


Continental island that includes; huge forests; large beaches of sand; dunes and deserts; small canyons; open plains; waterfalls; lakes and rivers.

Oceanic island that includes; old volcanic mountains and high plains.

Volcanic island that includes; high snow capped mountains and sharp mountain peaks.

Archipelagos island that includes; group of curved beaches; collection of small and scattered islands.

 
Below this YouTube video showcases a new type of landscape - Crater Island - during the tough winter seasons using a Natural Placement Based on Angular Coordinates (NPBAC) that I designed and shaped with World Machine 3 Professional and GeoGlyph. This NPBAC process (X and Y axes placed accordingly with the Z axis) makes landscape scenes even more realistic, especially with the tree placement, erosion, and snow processes. In this video, we can easily see the natural HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting effect as well as the effects of snow and the effects of blizzard.
 

 
Also between each island types will be a lot of very small and small islands, from few square meters to few hundreds square meters. I heard that there is an one square meter island with only one tree somewhere lost in the huge ocean, with a treasure to get - one old story talks about an old pirate weapons - will you find it?
 
What will I be able to craft?
 
By cutting trees and gathering resources, you will be able to craft items by using the Menu Inventory System - M.I.S - that has been designed to offer a simple, effective, and fast approach to meet the player needs; as follow: An Axe (to cut trees); A Hatchet (to cut and split wood); A Knife (to cut animal meats); A Iron Pan (to cook); A hammer (to drive nails into wood and to shape metal); A sledgehammer (to break stones and rocks); A Bow and Arrows (to hunt); A Raft (to move from island to island); A Wooden​ Water Collector (to wash your hands and to drink); A Fire (to keep warm); A Metal Foundry (to build a metal shelter); A Bed (to save and load your game progress); A Wood Shelter (to have a second type base); and A Metal Shelter (to have a first type base). This crafting list will be extended with more craftable props in future game versions.
Below a YouTube video and a picture showcasing the following craftable props; Axes; Hatchets; Knifes; Iron Pans; and Wooden Water Collectors.
 

 

 
The following is a list of other craftable props needed for shelters purposes.
Wood Shelter:

Metal Shelter:

 
What resources can be gathered?
 
Below a list of resources that the player can gather for crafting purposes.
Rocks:

Woods:

Sticks:

Trees:

 
What types of shelters can I build?
 
A Wood Shelter (to have a second type base) and A Metal Shelter (to have a first type base). The player can build almost anywhere on the landscape except under water and on a land with an angle more than 45 degrees. The player will be able to build any shelters by cutting trees and gathering resources. Make sure you got an axe (to cut trees), a hatchet (to cut and split wood), and a hammer (to drive nails into wood and to shape metal).
The YouTube video and screenshots below are showing different configuration of shelters.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
Which conditions will make the player to die?
 
You have to manage your hunger, thirst, cold and tiredness if you want to survive. The winters are very cold so you better be well prepared. Also the wildlife animals are a BIG THREATS!
Bald eagles can definitely attack the player, but the injuries inflicted are not lethal. During mating seasons, bald eagles become much more territorial; this is best to keep a safe distance from a bald eagle and to respect the bird's space.
Cougars may attack if cornered and if the player keep running, this might stimulates the cougar instinct to chase. Same if the player stop moving for a long time. Standing still however may cause the cougar to consider the player an easy prey.
Bears are rare. This is highly recommended that the player don't unwittingly attract them. If the player decide to kill a bear, you better be extremely well prepared. Even the player shelter might not be the safest place against bear attacks.
Bison are among the most dangerous animals that the player can encountered and will attack the player if provoked. They appear slow because of their lethargic movements, but can easily outrun the player, even running at full speed. Be prepared to run fast!
Moose are not usually aggressive towards the player, but can be provoked or frightened to behave with aggression. They will attack the player more than bears and wolves combined, but usually with only minor consequences.
Elk are able to attack the player using strong legs and sharp hooves. The reason for a sudden aggression is to protect their small ones.
Coyote attacks on the player are uncommon and rarely will cause serious injuries, mainly due to rabies.
Wolf attacks against the player will occur only by healthy wolves. However this will remains as rare and unusual events. Remember that even healthy wolves dislike fire and smoke because it appears dangerous to them.
 
How long is a full day/night cycle in game?
 
The sources of light in Dismal Survival are the sun during the day and the moon during the night. The sun is rising from the east and is setting in the west. A full day/night cycle in game is exactly 60 minutes. So if you play 4 hours surviving, you survived 4 game days. All the islands are designed from a square pyramid shape. This method always shows beautiful stunning views from any high point. This is also a natural process of any landscape - mountain based. From a bird side view, the views are looking super realistic. The position of the sun and the moon in the sky are also an indicator of time. The lighting from the sun and the moon are impacting on the surface landscape. Also the shadows of the clouds in the atmosphere are directly reflected on the surface landscape. This lighting processes contribute to a realistic wind effects that can be seen on the moving flora as well as on the ocean waves.
The YouTube video below shows an extract periods of sunrise and of sunset recorded in real time directly from the editor of Unreal Engine 4. For video purposes, the extract periods of sunrise and of sunset have been accelerated by a factor of 10.
 

 
Real Atmospheric Depth
 
I passed a lot of time to design and simulate a Real Atmospheric Depth in real time according to the sun position. I was able to manage this by combining a Real Depth of Field and a Real Atmospheric Lighting.
The YouTube video below - Long Sunset Walk - show (1) a Real Depth of Field and (2) a Real Atmospheric Lighting. When both effects are combined, the result is (1) + (2) a Real Atmospheric Depth. This effect also give an idea about the real size of the islands.
 

 
From an aerial point of view, the Real Atmospheric Depth effect gives to the game a photo-realistic touch, as shown with the three pictures below.

CAMPAIGN - ROAD MAP
Future implementations:

Integrating Wildlife animals - (Bald Eagle, Cougar, Bear, Bison, Moose, Elk, Coyote, and Wolf).
Realistic seasons and weather conditions - (Wind and Cold, Rain, Snow, Thunderstorms and Ocean Storms).
More advanced Crafting System and Menu Inventory System - (Full ability to cut trees and flora, to break small stones, to build a fire and animal traps, to craft a raft to travel from island to island, to build an axe, a hammer, a bow and arrows).
Management of shelter, hunger, thirst, cold and tiredness - (You will need to craft special tier items. Wooden​ Water Collector, Bed to save and load your game progress).
Better shelter demolition effects based on full gravity for re collectable resources.

And plenty more amazing ideas that will be only possible with the right financial aspect.
I need your help to make this project a reality, that one day, you can download Dismal Survival on Stream, with my vision of the game fulfilled!
THANK YOU!! for taking the time to read. This is very much appreciated!

Hello, my name is John Salvage, and my ongoing passion is a role-playing game called Valhalla.  Originally developed while I was in college, I have been developing it on and off for over twenty years.  
The game is set in a world called Valhalla.  People that have died, many of them in battle, though not all of them heroes, wake up to find themselves in this strange land.  It is populated by creatures  and  characters  from  across time and space.  Gangsters can befriend Sorcerers while gunslingers combat aliens.  Genetically altered humans and cyborgs from earth’s future confront alien races.  If you can imagine it, it can survive in the world of Valhalla.
Check out the website at http://valhallagame.com/ to get a taste of this strange and interesting world.  See some aspects of the world that you can help to bring into being.  Some highlights include:


Valhalla Crier: News flashes from around the world.


The World of Valhalla: An overview of the social and political aspects of  Valhalla.


Monsters: A few of the creatures (alien, mythic, and animal) that populate this world.


Sample Art: See some of the fine artwork I have requisitioned on my way to completing this project.  Links to the artists can also be found here.

 
Help me, Indiegogo.  You’re my only hope.
            This Indiegogo campaign is all about putting the finishing touches onto the core rulebook.  The text is complete, most of the artwork is done, and adventure is waiting to be had.  All it needs are a few finishing touches.  In particular I need talented artist to complete a few spot illustrations and complete the border that will frame the pages.
            With the $2000 from this campaign I will be able to achieve both!
 
Perks
            I have a variety of perks you can receive depending on your contribution level.  You can earn a heartfelt thank you or an advanced and signed copy of the book.  For particularly generous contributors, you can also obtain a beta version of the Book of Monsters, and/or Magic of Valhalla.  Columbus Ohio residents can also look forward to the “Friends and Neighbors” special --let me help you with your labors as you have helped me with this project! 
            
Additional Ways to Help
            Can’t contribute?  No problem!  
            Other ways that you can help me achieve success include:

<p><b>Stolta riken &amp; gåtfulla platser [PDF]: </b>Denna massiva bok tar en titt dels ett antal nyskapade riken men också en hel mängd gåtfulla och mystiska platser runtom Mundana. Bland annat riket <i>Nermada </i>som är en vågmästare mellan Thalamur och Consaber. <i>Cermira </i>som ligger inklämt mellan Caserion och Mitheraskogen. <i>Utmark</i>, en otämjd vildmark mellan Drunok och de nordliga slätterna.

<p><b>Gryningens tempel,  Eldens väg del 1 [PDF]: </b>Eldens väg är namnet på den stora pilgrimsleden som likt en orm ringlar sig igenom det jargiska kejsardömet. Detta är början på en helt ny äventyrskampanj som kommer ta sin början i provinsen Merun och sluta långt senare i Xanto vid Blå havet. Kampanjen har ett fokus på rollpersonernas personliga utveckling, intressanta karaktärer samt att fungera som en introduktion till Jargien och de många aspekterna av Daakkyrkan. Förbered er på att möta heliga män, hedningar, fattiga, rika, ståtliga städer och ödslig vildmark samtidigt som man reser i profeterna och helgonens fotspår. Första delen ser ut att hamna på 40-60 sidor med mängder av handouts och extramaterial, ett helt nytt sätt att dela ut erfarenhet samt metoder att spela upp historiska berättelser som spelarna kan ta en aktiv del i.</p>
<p><b>Eon III [PDF]: </b>Är det saker i gamla Eon du är intresserad av? Vill du ha tillgång till texter, tabeller och regler så har du tur.

Bland annat det 70-sidiga spelledarkapitlet.</p><p><b>Behind the scenes [PDF]: </b>Hur går det egentligen till att skriva en rollspelsbok. Vilka hinder och problem uppstår och hur tacklar man att man är oense i gruppen, nya versioner av regler som kommer in i sjätte timmen samt hur man helt skriver om ett regelsystem men ändå försöker bevara det som utgör kärnan av Eon. Följ med från tiden innan Eon 1994-95 fram till 2014 och ta del i vad alla författare till Eons grundregler har att säga. Skvaller, konflikter och insikter utlovas.</p>
<p><b>Daakkyrkans ceremonier och böner [PDF]:</b> De som spelar mystiker och fördjupar sig i Daakyrkans mysterier kommer välja ut ett antal ritpaket som innehåller böner och ceremonier. Här presenteras ritpaket i ett format som lämpar sig för utskrivning med ett ritpaket på vardera sida så att mystikern kan plocka ut de riter denne vill ha. Dessutom innehåller denna PDF 2 stycken helt nya ritpaket som inte finns med i regelboken.</p><p><b>8 stycken wallpapers [jpg]: </b>Varför inte dekorera din datorskärm, iPad eller liknande med någon av dessa bilder från Eon IV. Alla skapade av konstnären Laura Sava. </p>
<p><b>Formulärhäfte [PDF]: </b>Detta häfte innehåller en samling lämpliga formulär för att underlätta spelet. Bland annat: Rollformuläret i två olika versioner. Ett formulär för spelledarpersoner som är anpassat för att göra lättare att hantera dessa i stridssituationer.

Krönikeformulär för att anteckna vad som händer under spelmöten. </p><p><br/></p><h1>Äventyrspaketen</h1>

Byn är fylld av hemligheter och underliga karaktärer och är en fisktank där rollpersonerna själva kan undersöka, nysta och lösa den gåtan där svaren inte alltid är moraliskt självklara. Äventyret är skrivet av Jonas Frizell som är en veteran när det gäller rollspel och spel i allmänhet. Till vardags jobbar han som översättare, är en medlem i skrivgruppen Styggelse och är en av skaparna bakom minikonventet Hemcon. Han är också en av grundarna till ASF som släppt ett flertal friformsäventyr samt scenarioboken Från Atlantis till Blekinge.<br/><br/><b>S:t Kerons sista vila</b>: Helgonet St Keron som kämpade för Jargien under ett stort krig har sin kropp begravd i ett avlägset kloster. Långt ifrån de ståtliga monumenten som hyllar honom i kejsardömets inre delar. En natt när rollpersonerna är i närheten vaknar de på värdshuset där de övernattar att någon bankar på dörren och skriker att bli insläppt. Något fasansfullt har vaknat i klostrets kryptor. Detta äventyr är ett klassiskt skräckäventyr där rollpersonerna kan få reda på en hemlighet som kyrkan försökt dölja för alla. Äventyret är skrivet av rollspelsveteranen Erik Sharma som var en av medlemmarna i den nu mer smått legendariska spelföreningen BSG. Han har spellett och skrivit äventyr i mer än 20 års tid. <br/><br/><b>Ett liv för Irian</b>: Detta äventyr är intriger på hög nivå. Rollpersonerna anställs som livvakter åt en av Irians förnämsta familjer men det visar sig att denne har hamnat i en dödlig konflikt med en annan familj. Det hela eskalerar sakteliga och snart börjar det tyda på att det finns andra makter som drar i trådarna som är långt mer fruktansvärda än man först kan ana. I detta äventyr så får rollpersonerna en insikt i samhällets högre skikt och maktspelet som pågår där. Författaren Totte Söderqvist har en magister i Entertainment Design and Technology, har läst allt för mycket teoretiskt filosofi för att ha sin sanity i fullgott skikt och är en luttrad rollspelare och spelteoretiker.<br/><br/><b>Muaraks ande</b>: Ett äventyr som utspelar sig i en by vid ett färjeläger i Jargien. Här blir rollpersonerna indragna i lokala konflikter mellan de adasiska folket som, cirefaliska handelsmän och luttrade hyrsvärd. Det är ett äventyr det många moraliska dilemman och färgstarka karaktärer. Författaren är Love Springfeldt en van skribent med lång rollpelsvana. Spelar gärna, leder hellre. Gillar absurdism och moraliska gråzoner, indie-spel och allt det som lämnats ute, som inte beskrivits, som hintas och antyds.<br/><br/><b>Där skuggorna ruva</b>: Detta äventyr skrevs en gång i tiden till den numer nedlagda rollspelstidningen Drakens Tand. Det har tagits upp, dammats av och slipats till. Här får vi bekanta oss med det mystiska skugglandet och vad som sker när ett barn från skugglandet hamnar hos människorna och när en Stagran från skugghovet bestämmer sig för att hämta tillbaka det.<br/><br/><b>Juliis pris</b>: Rollpersonerna blir indragna i kampen mellan en grupp bondefamiljer och en tyrannisk godsägare i Kejsardömets utkant. Rollpersonerna tvingas välja sida i en konflikt där allt inte är vad det verkar. Här får vi ta en suggestiv berättelse bland de bördiga sädesfälten där hednakulterna alltjämt dväljs kvar utanför kyrkans blick. Författaren, Robin Liljenberg, är av enligt många en av Sveriges absolut bästa spelledare och en expert på att ta fram mörk och suggestiv stämning och skapa scenarion där det inte finns några vinnare. Han arbetar för närvarande på sitt eget skräckrollspel: Illusionens fångar.<br/><br/><b>Avgrundens parlament</b>: En djupdykning i slummen i staden Xanto i den västra delen av kejsardömet. Namnet syftar på en skara desperata sluminvånare som inte bara befinner sig i konflikt med rättvisan utan också med undre världens makthavare. Här möter vi en värld av konflikter, upprorstankar, utsatthet, kättare och utstötta.  Äventyret är skrivet av Lukas Sjöström som är en luttrad rollspelare och eonit och som är mycket verksam på Rollspel.nu med sina tankar och idéer. Det är även han som inspirerade till Eon IV systemet med Arketyper och Miljö.<br/><br/><b>Under bergens skugga</b>: I en liten gruvby i provinsen Genrio sker underliga ting.  Vädret har blivit förvridet, markerna perverterade och de döda tycks inte finna någon frid.  De flesta tror att förövaren är ett övernaturligt väsen som hemsöker skogarna, rykten talar om en gast som vandrar under trädkronorna, sover på flodbotten och släcker liv för att straffa de som syndat. Samhället är av våldsamma forsar avskuret från de sydliga delarna av riket och isolerat under de nordliga bergens skuggor. Äventyret är skrivet av Eonveteranen Petter Nallo som bland annat är en av konstruktörerna till Eon IV.   <br/><br/><b>Oddhoders spegel</b>: En av trollkungen Oddhoders speglar har kommit på villovägar i det Jargiska kejsardömet och har hamnat i händerna på helt fel person. Denne använder spegeln till egen vinning men med farliga konsekvenser som denne själv inte kan förutse. Äventyret är skrivet av Daniel Klaminder som är en van spelledare, rollspelssamlare, idéhistoriker och som har arbetat på spelbutiken Goblin Games i Göteborg. Förbered er på något mörkt, udda och med oväntade inslag. <br/><br/><b>Två öl och bröd</b>: Här presenteras Värdshuset Två öl och bröd som drivs av alvkvinnan Miriel. Det har kommit att bli en plats dit äventyrare och uppdragsgivare söker sig för att göra affärer med varandra. När man inte tar sig ett bad i badstugan, ser till att bli barberad av värdshusvärdinnan själv eller dricker sig full med de andra kamrater så kan man passa på att leta efter diverse uppdrag. Två öl och bröd är en oas för en klassisk äventyrargrupp och presenteras här färgstarkt med en mängd äventyrsuppslag och spännande karaktärer. Äventyret är författat av en riktig veteran när det gäller rollspel. Krister Sundelin var inte bara med och startade Eon han har dessutom skrivit ett antal böcker till spelet bland annat Consaber, Alver, Dvärgar och Misslor. Han har även gett ut rollspelen Västmark och Skymningshem och arbetar för fullt på diverse andra projekt såsom flygstridsrollspelet Blå Himmel och det hårda och kärva klan-rollspelet Järn.  <br/><br/><b>Tiraken och pojken</b>: Ryktet sprider sig, en tirakslav har rymt och kidnappat sonen till en inflytelserik ädling. Folk samlas för att hitta rymlingen och skipa rättvisa. Men allting visar sig vara mycket mer komplicerat än vad man först kan tro. Detta är ett äventyr i flera lager och med många svåra moraliska beslut. Äventyret är skrivet av Petter Nallo som är en av skaparna av Eon IV. <br/><br/><b>S:t Daria</b>: I en av Jargiens kolonier genomsyrar dyrkan av lokalhelgonet S:t Daria hela samhället, så mycket att Daakkyrkan sänder rollpersonerna att undersöka huruvida helgonkulten utgör ett hot mot Aboraten. Det är dock ingen enkel uppgift, då invånarna tar sin tro på största allvar. Vilka konsekvenser får egentligen undersökningens slutsatser och hur långt är rollpersonerna beredda att gå för Aboraten? I det här äventyret blir spelarna obehagligt nära bekanta med Daakkyrkans metoder och ställs inför moraliska dilemman. Det är skrivet av Malin Liedberg, spelskribent och historienörd, som har femton års rollspelserfarenhet och en litteraturvetenskaplig magisterexamen i bagaget.<br/><br/><h1>Frakt</h1>

<h3>Eons historia</h3>
<p>Den första utgåvan av Eon kom 1996 och den senaste versionen, Eon IV, har varit under utveckling under tre års tid. Nu är den klar för tryck och utgivning under året. Eon IV är den första utgåvan som byggs kring en helt ny regelkärna men som ändå ligger nära den tidigare utgåvans känsla och stämning. Regelverket har slimmats och polerats för att göra det mer snabbspelat men utan att förlora djupet och detaljnivån.</p>
<p>Eons tidigare styrkor har förstärkts medan dess svagheter har minimerats eller tagits bort. Rollspelet är kompatibelt med tidigare utgåvor och de mer än 40 tilläggsböcker som publicerats till Eons kampanjvärld Mundana. Alltjämt ligger fokus på att skapa en upplevelse av en levande spelvärld som känns genomtänkt, trovärdig och fungerande. Det finns inget gott och ont utan det är en värld av gråskalor. Det är fantasy som ligger mer på nivå med Game of Thrones än Sagan om Ringens svartvita värld.</p><p>Eon IV öppnar för en spelupplevelse som gör det möjligt för många fler olika typer av rollspel och i mer varierande miljöer än bara äventyrande och skattletande i generiska fantasyländer.</p>
<h1>Vilka är vi</h1>
<p><b>Niklas Fröjd</b> har haft en passion för hobbyn sedan barnsben och tycker fortfarande att det är lika kul och spännande att hitta på nya världar, rita kartor och upptäcka dem. Har alltid funnit rollspelens regelsystem mycket fascinerande och tar det som en utmaning att bryta ner dem och analysera dem för att kunna finna deras svagheter och styrkor vilket också gäller när egna regler skapas. Jobbar som mjukvaruingenjör med fokus på webbapplikationer.</p>
<p><b>Petter Nallo</b> arbetade i början av 2000-talet heltid på Neogames som rollspelsförfattare och har varit projektledare och huvudförfattare till Eon och en mängd rollspelsböcker. Han har sedan arbetat som manusförfattare och konceptutvecklare för diverse svenska dataspelsföretag (bland annat Paradox Development Studios och First Planet Company) samt Sveriges Television, Jungle Peak AB och Los Angeles-baserade Rough Draft Studios. Förutom detta leder han även skrivgruppen Styggelse och har djupgående studier i Historia och Litteraturvetenskap.  </p>
<p><b>Anton Wahnström</b>s första erfarenhet av rollspel var på fritids när en kompis ritade kartor över nedlagda fabriker som man sedan med fantasins hjälp fick utforska. Det värsta monstret man kunde träffa på var svarta änkan, då blev det döden direkt. Långt senare började han spela Eon och fastnade direkt för detaljrikedomen i såväl värld som regler. Han har varit delaktig i flera Eonprodukter och nu senast utvecklandet av Eon IV. Är ingenjör och har fått nytta av detta när det gäller beräknandet av tärningssannolikheter.</p><p>Vi är tre av de sex grundarna till Helmgast AB som är producent av Eon IV. Helmgast har sin hemsida på <a href=""http://helmgast.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">helmgast.se</a> där även beskrivning av övriga grundare finns.</p>
<h1>Frågor och svar</h1>
<p><b>Vad är det som är nytt i fjärde utgåvan? </b></p>
<p>Nästan allt. Mer än 98 % av regelboken är helt nyskriven. Vi har behållit det som är kärnan i Eon men byggt om regelboken från grunden. Det är trots allt ett regelsystem från tidigt 90-tal och vi kände att det var dags att uppdatera vissa delar. Men de som har spelat Eon innan kommer att känna igen sig. Vi har däremot under år av speltest och en lång designprocess hitta snabbare och mer intressanta sätt att nå samma resultat som i gamla Eon.</p>
<p><b>Vad händer med de gamla Eon-produkterna? </b></p>
<p>Allt tidigare utgivet material som rör Mundana kommer att vara kompatibelt med den nya utgåvan. Vi kommer kring släppet av Eon IV att erbjuda konverteringsinstruktioner för hur tidigare utgåvors regler kan användas med den nya regelbasen.</p>
<p><b>Är några nya Eon-produkter planerade? </b></p>
<p>Ja ett flertal. Och många är redan färdigskrivna och väntar nu bara på layout och att bli släppta. De har väntat på att Eon IV ska bli färdigt så de kan anpassas till det nya regelsystemet. Så både landsmoduler, äventyrsböcker, magibok och mycket mer.</p><p></p><p><b>Hur funkar det med PDF:en av Eon IV<br/></b></p>
Efter crowdfundern är avslutat kommer vi göra Eon IV tillgänglig i en PDF för alla som crowdfundat. Under denna tid så tar vi också emot synpunkter och kommentarer på felaktigheter och konstigheter som vi kan justera innan tryck. <br/><p></p><p>För att förtydliga så kommer vi inte att skicka ut någon ny PDF av grundboken när den fysiska boken levereras i augusti. PDF:en som skickas ut i förskott är en exklusiv produkt bara för deltagarna i crowdfundingen.<br/></p></div>","Vad är Eon?Eon är ett fantasyrollspel fyllt av smutsig realism med fantastiska inslag. Det är en värld som trots drakar, häxmästare, vandöda fasor och gudar känns trovärdig. Det är en värld av gråskalor. Det finns ingen absolut ondska och det finns ingen absolut godhet. Det finns individer, deras handlingar och dess konsekvenser.Hade Eon varit en TV-serie hade den varit Game of Thrones (fast med fler fantastiska folkslag och monster).Detta är den fjärde utgåvan av rollspelet Eon. Helt nyskriven och reviderad med nya illustrationer och en uppdaterad regelmotor.

Det här behöver vi
Boken är klar och vi behöver endast pengar för att kunna trycka upp den. Pengar kommer även att användas till att betala illustratörer och planera framtida moduler som är planerade att släppas till jul.
Extramål
Nedan är en lista på våra extramål. Varje extramål innebär att materialet utökas eller förbättras när vi uppnår den summa som står angivet vid extramålet. Efter listan finns en djupare förklaring på vad de olika extramålen innebär.



Spelarintroduktion till Jargien. En PDF
där en spelare snabbt kan sätta sig in i kejsardömet, Daaktron, olika talesätt och liknande. Perfekt att ha liggande på spelbordet medan man spelar eller för en spelare att läsa igenom innan man börjar spela.  (4500€).

Grundboken trycks i färg innebär
att vi lämnar den svartvita perioden bakom oss och den blir genomgående i färg.  (5000€).

Grundboken får hårdpärm innebär
att den binds med hårdpärmar och blir såklart både tåligare och snyggare. (6000€).

Äventyrspaket är som booster packs. När vi når en ny nivå öppnar vi det nämnda äventyrspaketet och presenterar det äventyr eller de äventyr som ingår. Alla äventyr är centrerade kring Jargien med omnejd och är perfekt för att spela enstaka scenarier eller väva ihop till långa kampanjer. Många kan också användas som sidoäventyr till kampanjen Eldens väg (se spelpaketet).  Äventyren kommer sättas samman till en publikt
tillgänglig PDF som är layoutad och illustrerad. Potentiellt den mest massiva äventyrsmodulen någonsin!  (5500€, 7000€, 8000€, 9000€, 11000€, 13000€, 14000€, 16500€, 18000€, 23000€).

Kartor i inlagan innebär
att vi lägger in kartor precis i bokens början och dess slut. Således finns de alltid tillgängliga och får ingen skarv där delar av kartan ""försvinner"". Det kommer att vara en karta över det civiliserade Mundana (från Menon-Aun till Ebhron) samt en detaljerad karta över Jargiska Kejsardömet  (10000€).

Soundtrack till Eon - The Face of Deception. 2001 skulle Eon datorspelet Face of Deception släppts. Det behandlade inbördeskriget i Soldarn och var fyllt av färgstarka karaktärer, troll och hyggelmonster. Projekt gick i graven innan det han färdigställas. Men en del pärlor finns kvar. Bland annnat skapade kompositören Calle Hansson ett soundtrack med mer än 40 minuters stämningsfull bakgrundsmusik som står sig bra än idag (12000€).

Extra läsesnöre innebär att Grundboken får ett läsesnöre och övriga böcker får totalt två läsesnören (15000€).

Tärningsapp innebär att vi skapar en mobilapp som klarar av alla tärningar som används i Eon IV samt med allehanda finesser såsom att spara monsterdata och spelledarpersoner. Mobilappen kommer till både Android och iPhone (15500€).


Releasefest: Oj! Så här bra trodde vi inte att det skulle gå och så snabbt. Det firar vi med att ha en releasefest för Eon i Göteborg. Det blir till hösten (mest troligt i Augusti) och vi hör av oss med närmare information om när och var den kommer hållas. 


Indexapp: Denna mobilapp innehåller ett sökbart index över regelboken om man snabbt måste hitta alla förekomster av en term eller behöver slå upp en sida. 


Människans bästa vän: Denna PDF på 6 sidor (kan öka i sidantal något) som vi lägger till spelpaketet innehåller regler för att ha tränade djur till hjälp samt beskriver ett antal olika typer av hundar. 


Mystik & Magi läggs till spelpaketet som PDF. Förutom själva magin innehåller denna modul mycket användbart material såsom beskrivningar av Mundanas magikersällskap (thakalatribunalerna, legio colonan, ashariska magimästare och många fler), kända magiker (levande och döda), magiska varelser, magiteori, spådomar magiska platser och mycket mer. 


Vilddjur och styggelser 1: Vi fyller ut spelpaketet ytterligare denna gång med en 6-sidig PDF fylld med diverse vilddjur och styggelser som rollpersonerna kan stöta på i Mundanas vildmark. 


Vilddjur och styggelser 2: Vi expanderar PDF:en Vilddjur och styggelser med ytterligare 6 sidor till totalt 12 fullmatade sidor med diverse styggelser och bestar. 


Diamantäpplet är första delen på kampanjen Sylfens vrede. Det har varit slutsålt en längre tid och  Diamantäpplet släpps nu som en PDF till alla. Regelmotorn är uppdaterad till EON IV-reglerna och äventyret är även expanderat jämfört med den tidigare utgåvan. 36 sidor (minst) äventyrande i Västmarks ångande träskmarker. 


Webbportal för Eon innebär att vi bygger en webbportal för Eon på Helmgast.se med rikligt med wiki-material, zoombara kartor, möjligheter att lagra och skapa sina rollpersoner och mycket mer.  


Draken Khatha: Vi lägget till två sidor i regelboken (alla utgåvor) där vi beskriver draken Khatha som dväljs i bergspassen mellan det jargiska kejsardömet och Kamor. Draken beskrivs med egenskaper, förmågor, svagheter och allt annat man kan önska. 


Nytt folkslag innebär att ett nytt, icke tidigare presenterat, folkslag läggs till Äventyrarens handbok (som ingår i spelpaketet) och blir således ytterligare en resurs när man ska skapa sin rollperson.

Den tusenögda: Denna demon hade egentligen tänkts sparas till del 2 av Eldens väg. Men om vi når till denna nivå så kommer vi introducera denna styggelse nu. Vi expanderar demondelen i regelboken med ett helt uppslag och beskriver demonen ""Den tusenögda"" som har dväljts under lång tid i Det jargiska kejsardömet och varit verksam som orakel och intrigmakare samt styrt över ett stort följe dyrkare i Lemira. 

Uppdaterade folkslag: I Eon IV så får vardera folkslag en sida och detaljerade beskrivningar. Det gör att vi inte kan presentera alla de folkslag som fanns med i Eon III. Men i denna PDF som är tillgängligt för alla gör vi en regeluppdatering för samtliga så att de ska kunna konverteras och användas i spel. 


Eon novis: Här presenteras en PDF med Eons regler i en förenklad version. Perfekt för de som vill introducera Eon till de som är nybörjare inom rollspel eller bara vill spela en snabbare och regellättare version av Eon. 


Skugglandet: I denna PDF blir en del av spelpaketet introduceras det mystiska skugglandet och de väsen som dväljs där.  Vi får även en större inblick i ett av Skugglandets många regioner.

Helmgast: Den numera ikoniska Helmgasten kommer att presenteras i regelboken med uppdaterade värden för Eon IV.

Blodskulterna: En PDF som beskriver blodskulterna som sprider sig i Jargiska kejsardömet. Vi får en inblick i dekadenta sammanslutningar, begäret efter evigt liv och de vandödas intriger.


2 x Troll: Vi fyller ut regelboken med inte bara ett utan två troll. Det väldiga grottrollet med sin ständiga hunger presenteras invid det listiga och illvilliga spindeltrollet.

Tauperna: Detta mystiska folkslag skulle först vara en del av den numer välkända boken Barbarer & Människofolk men de passade inte riktigt in bland de övriga. Texten om tauperna blev längre och längre och planen blev att släppa en egen modul men denna lades på hyllan. Nu tas materialet fram, dammas av och presenteras här för första gången. Få en inblick i deras exotiska kultur samt en beskrivning av Taupernas dal - urhemmet i norr. 

Spelpaketet
Spelpaketet kommer endast finnas tillgängligt under crowdfundern. Nedan följer det detaljerade innehållet i paketet. 
Äventyrarens handbok: En bok på 24 sidor (men det finns en risk att den sväller upp till 32) som innehåller allt det som en äventyrare behöver. Flera sidor med vapen och rustningar som inte fick plats i regelboken, exotiska vapen och de som är knutna till kulturer annat än den traditionellt jargiska. Dessutom finns här regler för strid från hästryggen och en stor uppsättning riddjur med beskrivning, bilder och regelvärden samt lite annat smått och gott. Stridskort: Två stridskort i A5, i fyrfärg och på hårt glossy papper.  Dessa innehåller sammanfattande regler för de olika stridstaktikerna, försvarstaktikerna och fördelarna man kan få genom att spendera övertag som man fått i striden.
Jargienkarta A3: En karta över det jargiska kejsardömet i fyrfärg.Mundanakarta A3: En karta över Mundanas centrala delar i fyrfärg.

De sexsidiga tärningarna ökar i antal via extramål i crowdfundingen.
Bokmärke: Ett slumpvist utvalt Eon-bokmärke (finns i 6 olika versioner) för att hålla redo på viktiga sidor i modulerna.
Stolta riken & gåtfulla platser [PDF]: Denna massiva bok tar en titt dels ett antal nyskapade riken men också en hel mängd gåtfulla och mystiska platser runtom Mundana. Bland annat riket Nermada som är en vågmästare mellan Thalamur och Consaber. Cermira som ligger inklämt mellan Caserion och Mitheraskogen. Utmark, en otämjd vildmark mellan Drunok och de nordliga slätterna. En reseskildring  genom Underjorden, fakta om den frusna Mitheraskogen, otillgängliga platser i Västlanden, en detaljerad beskrivning av Zhirim Mian, den lalastiska staden Astara, provinser och fraktioner i Stora arkipelagen, det soldiska baroniet Trollbane, det underjordiska alvriket Kinané’an oro, bergsfästet Lashorak och mycket, mycket mer. 
Gryningens tempel,  Eldens väg del 1 [PDF]: Eldens väg är namnet på den stora pilgrimsleden som likt en orm ringlar sig igenom det jargiska kejsardömet. Detta är början på en helt ny äventyrskampanj som kommer ta sin början i provinsen Merun och sluta långt senare i Xanto vid Blå havet. Kampanjen har ett fokus på rollpersonernas personliga utveckling, intressanta karaktärer samt att fungera som en introduktion till Jargien och de många aspekterna av Daakkyrkan. Förbered er på att möta heliga män, hedningar, fattiga, rika, ståtliga städer och ödslig vildmark samtidigt som man reser i profeterna och helgonens fotspår. Första delen ser ut att hamna på 40-60 sidor med mängder av handouts och extramaterial, ett helt nytt sätt att dela ut erfarenhet samt metoder att spela upp historiska berättelser som spelarna kan ta en aktiv del i.
Eon III [PDF]: Är det saker i gamla Eon du är intresserad av? Vill du ha tillgång till texter, tabeller och regler så har du tur. Med i spelpaketet får du båda regelböckerna till Eon III som PDF. Det är 464 fullmatade sidor varav majoriteten av informationen är fullt kompatibel med Eon IV. Bland annat det 70-sidiga spelledarkapitlet.Behind the scenes [PDF]: Hur går det egentligen till att skriva en rollspelsbok. Vilka hinder och problem uppstår och hur tacklar man att man är oense i gruppen, nya versioner av regler som kommer in i sjätte timmen samt hur man helt skriver om ett regelsystem men ändå försöker bevara det som utgör kärnan av Eon.

Daakkyrkans ceremonier och böner [PDF]: De som spelar mystiker och fördjupar sig i Daakyrkans mysterier kommer välja ut ett antal ritpaket som innehåller böner och ceremonier. Här presenteras ritpaket i ett format som lämpar sig för utskrivning med ett ritpaket på vardera sida så att mystikern kan plocka ut de riter denne vill ha. Dessutom innehåller denna PDF 2 stycken helt nya ritpaket som inte finns med i regelboken.8 stycken wallpapers [jpg]: Varför inte dekorera din datorskärm, iPad eller liknande med någon av dessa bilder från Eon IV. Alla skapade av konstnären Laura Sava. 
Formulärhäfte [PDF]: Detta häfte innehåller en samling lämpliga formulär för att underlätta spelet. Bland annat: Rollformuläret i två olika versioner. Ett formulär för spelledarpersoner som är anpassat för att göra lättare att hantera dessa i stridssituationer. Äventyrskroksformulär där spelledaren kan anteckna äventyrskrokar och kopplingarna de har till rollpersonerna. Utrustningsformulär som är ett separat formulär för att skriva upp utrustning. Krönikeformulär för att anteckna vad som händer under spelmöten. Äventyrspaketen
Nedan följer beskrivning av de äventyrspaket som öppnats och vad de innehållerArvet: Ett äventyr som tar sin början under en stor festlighet i staden Irian i östra Jargien och sedan leder rollpersonerna upp i bergen till en avlägsen bergsby. Byn är fylld av hemligheter och underliga karaktärer och är en fisktank där rollpersonerna själva kan undersöka, nysta och lösa den gåtan där svaren inte alltid är moraliskt självklara. Äventyret är skrivet av Jonas Frizell som är en veteran när det gäller rollspel och spel i allmänhet. Till vardags jobbar han som översättare, är en medlem i skrivgruppen Styggelse och är en av skaparna bakom minikonventet Hemcon. Han är också en av grundarna till ASF som släppt ett flertal friformsäventyr samt scenarioboken Från Atlantis till Blekinge.S:t Kerons sista vila: Helgonet St Keron som kämpade för Jargien under ett stort krig har sin kropp begravd i ett avlägset kloster. Långt ifrån de ståtliga monumenten som hyllar honom i kejsardömets inre delar. En natt när rollpersonerna är i närheten vaknar de på värdshuset där de övernattar att någon bankar på dörren och skriker att bli insläppt. Något fasansfullt har vaknat i klostrets kryptor. Detta äventyr är ett klassiskt skräckäventyr där rollpersonerna kan få reda på en hemlighet som kyrkan försökt dölja för alla. Äventyret är skrivet av rollspelsveteranen Erik Sharma som var en av medlemmarna i den nu mer smått legendariska spelföreningen BSG. Han har spellett och skrivit äventyr i mer än 20 års tid. Ett liv för Irian: Detta äventyr är intriger på hög nivå. Rollpersonerna anställs som livvakter åt en av Irians förnämsta familjer men det visar sig att denne har hamnat i en dödlig konflikt med en annan familj. Det hela eskalerar sakteliga och snart börjar det tyda på att det finns andra makter som drar i trådarna som är långt mer fruktansvärda än man först kan ana. I detta äventyr så får rollpersonerna en insikt i samhällets högre skikt och maktspelet som pågår där. Författaren Totte Söderqvist har en magister i Entertainment Design and Technology, har läst allt för mycket teoretiskt filosofi för att ha sin sanity i fullgott skikt och är en luttrad rollspelare och spelteoretiker.Muaraks ande: Ett äventyr som utspelar sig i en by vid ett färjeläger i Jargien. Här blir rollpersonerna indragna i lokala konflikter mellan de adasiska folket som, cirefaliska handelsmän och luttrade hyrsvärd. Det är ett äventyr det många moraliska dilemman och färgstarka karaktärer. Författaren är Love Springfeldt en van skribent med lång rollpelsvana. Spelar gärna, leder hellre. Gillar absurdism och moraliska gråzoner, indie-spel och allt det som lämnats ute, som inte beskrivits, som hintas och antyds.Där skuggorna ruva: Detta äventyr skrevs en gång i tiden till den numer nedlagda rollspelstidningen Drakens Tand. Det har tagits upp, dammats av och slipats till. Här får vi bekanta oss med det mystiska skugglandet och vad som sker när ett barn från skugglandet hamnar hos människorna och när en Stagran från skugghovet bestämmer sig för att hämta tillbaka det.Juliis pris: Rollpersonerna blir indragna i kampen mellan en grupp bondefamiljer och en tyrannisk godsägare i Kejsardömets utkant. Rollpersonerna tvingas välja sida i en konflikt där allt inte är vad det verkar. Här får vi ta en suggestiv berättelse bland de bördiga sädesfälten där hednakulterna alltjämt dväljs kvar utanför kyrkans blick. Författaren, Robin Liljenberg, är av enligt många en av Sveriges absolut bästa spelledare och en expert på att ta fram mörk och suggestiv stämning och skapa scenarion där det inte finns några vinnare. Han arbetar för närvarande på sitt eget skräckrollspel: Illusionens fångar.Avgrundens parlament: En djupdykning i slummen i staden Xanto i den västra delen av kejsardömet. Namnet syftar på en skara desperata sluminvånare som inte bara befinner sig i konflikt med rättvisan utan också med undre världens makthavare. Här möter vi en värld av konflikter, upprorstankar, utsatthet, kättare och utstötta.  Äventyret är skrivet av Lukas Sjöström som är en luttrad rollspelare och eonit och som är mycket verksam på Rollspel.nu med sina tankar och idéer. Det är även han som inspirerade till Eon IV systemet med Arketyper och Miljö.Under bergens skugga: I en liten gruvby i provinsen Genrio sker underliga ting.  Vädret har blivit förvridet, markerna perverterade och de döda tycks inte finna någon frid.  De flesta tror att förövaren är ett övernaturligt väsen som hemsöker skogarna, rykten talar om en gast som vandrar under trädkronorna, sover på flodbotten och släcker liv för att straffa de som syndat. Samhället är av våldsamma forsar avskuret från de sydliga delarna av riket och isolerat under de nordliga bergens skuggor. Äventyret är skrivet av Eonveteranen Petter Nallo som bland annat är en av konstruktörerna till Eon IV.   Oddhoders spegel: En av trollkungen Oddhoders speglar har kommit på villovägar i det Jargiska kejsardömet och har hamnat i händerna på helt fel person. Denne använder spegeln till egen vinning men med farliga konsekvenser som denne själv inte kan förutse. Äventyret är skrivet av Daniel Klaminder som är en van spelledare, rollspelssamlare, idéhistoriker och som har arbetat på spelbutiken Goblin Games i Göteborg. Förbered er på något mörkt, udda och med oväntade inslag. Två öl och bröd: Här presenteras Värdshuset Två öl och bröd som drivs av alvkvinnan Miriel. Det har kommit att bli en plats dit äventyrare och uppdragsgivare söker sig för att göra affärer med varandra. När man inte tar sig ett bad i badstugan, ser till att bli barberad av värdshusvärdinnan själv eller dricker sig full med de andra kamrater så kan man passa på att leta efter diverse uppdrag. Två öl och bröd är en oas för en klassisk äventyrargrupp och presenteras här färgstarkt med en mängd äventyrsuppslag och spännande karaktärer. Äventyret är författat av en riktig veteran när det gäller rollspel. Krister Sundelin var inte bara med och startade Eon han har dessutom skrivit ett antal böcker till spelet bland annat Consaber, Alver, Dvärgar och Misslor. Han har även gett ut rollspelen Västmark och Skymningshem och arbetar för fullt på diverse andra projekt såsom flygstridsrollspelet Blå Himmel och det hårda och kärva klan-rollspelet Järn.  Tiraken och pojken: Ryktet sprider sig, en tirakslav har rymt och kidnappat sonen till en inflytelserik ädling. Folk samlas för att hitta rymlingen och skipa rättvisa. Men allting visar sig vara mycket mer komplicerat än vad man först kan tro. Detta är ett äventyr i flera lager och med många svåra moraliska beslut. Äventyret är skrivet av Petter Nallo som är en av skaparna av Eon IV. S:t Daria: I en av Jargiens kolonier genomsyrar dyrkan av lokalhelgonet S:t Daria hela samhället, så mycket att Daakkyrkan sänder rollpersonerna att undersöka huruvida helgonkulten utgör ett hot mot Aboraten. Det är dock ingen enkel uppgift, då invånarna tar sin tro på största allvar. Vilka konsekvenser får egentligen undersökningens slutsatser och hur långt är rollpersonerna beredda att gå för Aboraten? I det här äventyret blir spelarna obehagligt nära bekanta med Daakkyrkans metoder och ställs inför moraliska dilemman. Det är skrivet av Malin Liedberg, spelskribent och historienörd, som har femton års rollspelserfarenhet och en litteraturvetenskaplig magisterexamen i bagaget.Frakt

Eons historia
Den första utgåvan av Eon kom 1996 och den senaste versionen, Eon IV, har varit under utveckling under tre års tid. Nu är den klar för tryck och utgivning under året. Eon IV är den första utgåvan som byggs kring en helt ny regelkärna men som ändå ligger nära den tidigare utgåvans känsla och stämning. Regelverket har slimmats och polerats för att göra det mer snabbspelat men utan att förlora djupet och detaljnivån.
Eons tidigare styrkor har förstärkts medan dess svagheter har minimerats eller tagits bort. Rollspelet är kompatibelt med tidigare utgåvor och de mer än 40 tilläggsböcker som publicerats till Eons kampanjvärld Mundana. Alltjämt ligger fokus på att skapa en upplevelse av en levande spelvärld som känns genomtänkt, trovärdig och fungerande. Det finns inget gott och ont utan det är en värld av gråskalor. Det är fantasy som ligger mer på nivå med Game of Thrones än Sagan om Ringens svartvita värld.Eon IV öppnar för en spelupplevelse som gör det möjligt för många fler olika typer av rollspel och i mer varierande miljöer än bara äventyrande och skattletande i generiska fantasyländer.
Vilka är vi
Niklas Fröjd har haft en passion för hobbyn sedan barnsben och tycker fortfarande att det är lika kul och spännande att hitta på nya världar, rita kartor och upptäcka dem. Har alltid funnit rollspelens regelsystem mycket fascinerande och tar det som en utmaning att bryta ner dem och analysera dem för att kunna finna deras svagheter och styrkor vilket också gäller när egna regler skapas. Jobbar som mjukvaruingenjör med fokus på webbapplikationer.
Petter Nallo arbetade i början av 2000-talet heltid på Neogames som rollspelsförfattare och har varit projektledare och huvudförfattare till Eon och en mängd rollspelsböcker. Han har sedan arbetat som manusförfattare och konceptutvecklare för diverse svenska dataspelsföretag (bland annat Paradox Development Studios och First Planet Company) samt Sveriges Television, Jungle Peak AB och Los Angeles-baserade Rough Draft Studios. Förutom detta leder han även skrivgruppen Styggelse och har djupgående studier i Historia och Litteraturvetenskap.  
Anton Wahnströms första erfarenhet av rollspel var på fritids när en kompis ritade kartor över nedlagda fabriker som man sedan med fantasins hjälp fick utforska. Det värsta monstret man kunde träffa på var svarta änkan, då blev det döden direkt. Långt senare började han spela Eon och fastnade direkt för detaljrikedomen i såväl värld som regler. Han har varit delaktig i flera Eonprodukter och nu senast utvecklandet av Eon IV. Är ingenjör och har fått nytta av detta när det gäller beräknandet av tärningssannolikheter.Vi är tre av de sex grundarna till Helmgast AB som är producent av Eon IV. Helmgast har sin hemsida på helmgast.se där även beskrivning av övriga grundare finns.
Frågor och svar
Vad är det som är nytt i fjärde utgåvan? 
Nästan allt. Mer än 98 % av regelboken är helt nyskriven. Vi har behållit det som är kärnan i Eon men byggt om regelboken från grunden. Det är trots allt ett regelsystem från tidigt 90-tal och vi kände att det var dags att uppdatera vissa delar. Men de som har spelat Eon innan kommer att känna igen sig. Vi har däremot under år av speltest och en lång designprocess hitta snabbare och mer intressanta sätt att nå samma resultat som i gamla Eon.
Vad händer med de gamla Eon-produkterna? 
Allt tidigare utgivet material som rör Mundana kommer att vara kompatibelt med den nya utgåvan. Vi kommer kring släppet av Eon IV att erbjuda konverteringsinstruktioner för hur tidigare utgåvors regler kan användas med den nya regelbasen.
Är några nya Eon-produkter planerade? 
Ja ett flertal. Och många är redan färdigskrivna och väntar nu bara på layout och att bli släppta. De har väntat på att Eon IV ska bli färdigt så de kan anpassas till det nya regelsystemet. Så både landsmoduler, äventyrsböcker, magibok och mycket mer.Hur funkar det med PDF:en av Eon IV
Efter crowdfundern är avslutat kommer vi göra Eon IV tillgänglig i en PDF för alla som crowdfundat. Under denna tid så tar vi också emot synpunkter och kommentarer på felaktigheter och konstigheter som vi kan justera innan tryck. För att förtydliga så kommer vi inte att skicka ut någon ny PDF av grundboken när den fysiska boken levereras i augusti. PDF:en som skickas ut i förskott är en exklusiv produkt bara för deltagarna i crowdfundingen.",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Don Searcy and with over 30 years of experience in the construction industry, I was 
tired of the waste, mess and time used during the cleaning process of my
 airless paint sprayer. Generally it takes 20 gallons, or more,  of good clean water as well as wasting time and paint. On any given project it also would take valuable time, 30 minutes, or more to flush and clean. So I thought to myself ""there has to be an easier way""
and from that moment on I was determined to design and manufacture an 
easier, faster, more efficient and less wasteful way to clean my airless 
sprayer.</p>
<p>In 2013, beginning with a rough prototype and some innovative 
testing, I created The Bottom Feeder and founded Paragon Industries. 
LLC. Throughout the process I felt that it was time to get industry responses as to the validity of The Bottom Feeder and what it do, so in the months following I attended the National Hardware
 Show in Las Vegas. Going to the show with three prototypes, a video and a passion to succeed, I set up a booth and began the process of making The Bottom Feeder an industry name. During the show and since, the interest and inquiries
 have been a bit overwhelming. I have had calls and emails from the big 
box stores, large paint companies and many retail and drop ship 
companies.<br/></p>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>I would like to thank Rob Fletcher and the Mad Cow pulling team for helping me with this video.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FKTmM5XiApaw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKTmM5XiApaw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FKTmM5XiApaw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>In Summary</h3>
<p>After making an investment in to start the process The Bottom Feeder is ready to go on to the next phase, production. The mold has been competed and custom buckets are being produced.  <br/></p>
<p>This financial campaign is basically broken into two parts; part one will allow for additional operational capital needed to keep up with orders, and the expansion of additional accessories and attachments to be manufactured. Part two is for funds to be deposited into a company account. This would allow me to take a hiatus from my construction business and devote 100% of my time to the manufacturing, marketing and disbursement of the custom paint buckets.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1025029/files/20141117221712-20140616_193436.jpg?1416291432"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In reaching the goal of funding The Bottom Feeder will not
only revolutionize how an airless paint sprayer is used for paint, but will
introduce a whole new way that the airless sprayer can and will be used in many
other industries. The sprayer will be transformed into a way that the consumer
can spray weeds, bugs, automobiles and any other surface that can be imagined.
There are possibilities to be used to treat a household surrounding with a fire
retardant, to help prevent the total loss in the case of a brush fire, to be
used as a mass decontamination for a hazardous material situation, allow a farmer to spot
treat crops, trees or irrigation areas. The uses are endless with the right imagination.
Not to mention that in lean water areas, the saving of waste water to clean and
flush out the sprayer as well.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I am  looking for funding in the amount of $75,000 to take
The Bottom Feeder into the future. We will expand from a home garage-based business into a warehouse that will provide jobs
in the community.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> In addition to personnel needed to assemble the custom paint buckets, we would require other potential employees. Along with the custom paint buckets, the
expansion and addition of accessories, packaging, marketing and sales, development of a state of the art website,
 along with employing many more people. In addition to the use of funds for expansion and
growth, I will be allowed to take a hiatus from my construction business,
devote my time to Paragon, travel and make sales. If full funding is achieved,
I would be able to afford a minimum of one year of 100% commitment and not have
to juggle two careers. In the event that a funding goal is not met, our first
commitment is to the growth and expansion of the company, making sales and
creating employment in the community. With the generosity of your commitment
and contribution we have a number of different perks that we are offering, from calendars to shirts to offering the first custom buckets off the assembly line.
So are you ready to get in on a one of a kind product as it is introduced to
the corporate world? </span><br/></p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>How can a custom paint bucket change
the world? In the creation and design of The Bottom Feeder, the focus was on how
to be environmentally safe, save time, money and material. Time will be saved by the simple process of
cleaning and flushing out the system of the airless sprayer with the, patent
pending, quick connect system preventing material waste in the whole process. The

</div>
</div>","Introduction
My name is Don Searcy and with over 30 years of experience in the construction industry, I was 
tired of the waste, mess and time used during the cleaning process of my
 airless paint sprayer. Generally it takes 20 gallons, or more,  of good clean water as well as wasting time and paint. On any given project it also would take valuable time, 30 minutes, or more to flush and clean. So I thought to myself ""there has to be an easier way""
and from that moment on I was determined to design and manufacture an 
easier, faster, more efficient and less wasteful way to clean my airless 
sprayer.
In 2013, beginning with a rough prototype and some innovative 
testing, I created The Bottom Feeder and founded Paragon Industries. 
LLC. Throughout the process I felt that it was time to get industry responses as to the validity of The Bottom Feeder and what it do, so in the months following I attended the National Hardware
 Show in Las Vegas. Going to the show with three prototypes, a video and a passion to succeed, I set up a booth and began the process of making The Bottom Feeder an industry name. During the show and since, the interest and inquiries
 have been a bit overwhelming. I have had calls and emails from the big 
box stores, large paint companies and many retail and drop ship 
companies.
The Pitch
I would like to thank Rob Fletcher and the Mad Cow pulling team for helping me with this video.


In Summary
After making an investment in to start the process The Bottom Feeder is ready to go on to the next phase, production. The mold has been competed and custom buckets are being produced.  
This financial campaign is basically broken into two parts; part one will allow for additional operational capital needed to keep up with orders, and the expansion of additional accessories and attachments to be manufactured. Part two is for funds to be deposited into a company account. This would allow me to take a hiatus from my construction business and devote 100% of my time to the manufacturing, marketing and disbursement of the custom paint buckets.





In reaching the goal of funding The Bottom Feeder will not
only revolutionize how an airless paint sprayer is used for paint, but will
introduce a whole new way that the airless sprayer can and will be used in many
other industries. The sprayer will be transformed into a way that the consumer
can spray weeds, bugs, automobiles and any other surface that can be imagined.
There are possibilities to be used to treat a household surrounding with a fire
retardant, to help prevent the total loss in the case of a brush fire, to be
used as a mass decontamination for a hazardous material situation, allow a farmer to spot
treat crops, trees or irrigation areas. The uses are endless with the right imagination.
Not to mention that in lean water areas, the saving of waste water to clean and
flush out the sprayer as well.
  What We Need & What You Get


I am  looking for funding in the amount of $75,000 to take
The Bottom Feeder into the future. We will expand from a home garage-based business into a warehouse that will provide jobs
in the community.


 In addition to personnel needed to assemble the custom paint buckets, we would require other potential employees. Along with the custom paint buckets, the
expansion and addition of accessories, packaging, marketing and sales, development of a state of the art website,
 along with employing many more people. In addition to the use of funds for expansion and
growth, I will be allowed to take a hiatus from my construction business,
devote my time to Paragon, travel and make sales. If full funding is achieved,
I would be able to afford a minimum of one year of 100% commitment and not have
to juggle two careers. In the event that a funding goal is not met, our first
commitment is to the growth and expansion of the company, making sales and
creating employment in the community. With the generosity of your commitment
and contribution we have a number of different perks that we are offering, from calendars to shirts to offering the first custom buckets off the assembly line.
So are you ready to get in on a one of a kind product as it is introduced to
the corporate world? 
  The Impact How can a custom paint bucket change
the world? In the creation and design of The Bottom Feeder, the focus was on how
to be environmentally safe, save time, money and material. Time will be saved by the simple process of
cleaning and flushing out the system of the airless sprayer with the, patent
pending, quick connect system preventing material waste in the whole process. The
savings of time and material equates to the saving of money. With less waste of valuable paint and the minimal amount of water required to clean and flush out the system, makes The Bottom Feeder is an environmentally safe product being introduced to the world.

<p>Hi there,<strong> </strong></p>
<p>My name is Anthony Redoblado. I am currently developing a game called Jubejube the Robot Monkey. It was based on a character I developed almost 6 years ago just after animation school. It wasn't until I took gaming at Seneca College and learned what could be done with game engines that I realized this dream could be real. This character could be fun to play and could be on iOS and Android devices before this Christmas.</p>
<p>My aim is to raise money so that I could purchase the right software, buy the right equipment and get enough help to create a AAA quality game using Unity 3.5, 3D Studio Max, ZBrush, Adobe Photoshop, and necessary SDK's (software development kit).</p>
<p>I am working really hard on this from home and will be working on this dream project of mine from now until October 2012 with a goal to submit this awesome game to Apple and Google before November 1st, 2012.</p>
<p>I just want to express my thanks and appreciation for checking out my campaign, thanks so much for your time and for your support. I really appreciate it!<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>With so much thanks,<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anthony.</strong></p>

I was formely owned by several  </b><i><b>co-seigneurs</b></i><b>, who were the vassals of the Counts of Toulouse. Since the thirteenth century, I have stood proudly in a lovely little village with magnificent breathtaking views across a rolling, green landscape of meadow, woodland and river valley.  Apart from the winters, which can often be cold, the climate is mild and in the summer hot with cool soothing evenings in which to relax and absorb the fragrance of the co.</b></b></p><b></b><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>During the Renaissance,  and in  the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, I was redesigned. A document of  the Parliament of Toulouse, in the  fourteenth century, authorised  the village to “re-fortify the castle“, because   had already suffered disfiguring scars from the rigours of war.  But the nineteenth and twentieth centuries d isfigured me more. Until, I was discovered by Marie-Chantal and Michel who have restored much  f my thirteenth and fourteenth century character. Now, all the false ceilings have been removed, closed-up doorways and covered mullioned windows have been re-opened and plaster replaced by  ime coating. But I have been tastefully modernised too : electricity has been brought up to present-day standard, the water in the taps is running again and modern bathrooms have been integrated into the prevailing style.</b></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>*A character from my past : </b>The Prefect of Morbian: Sieur De Chazelles, son of Sir de Chazelles, Lord of Lunac, and Lady born ""de Montlauzeur"" * Right: the village of Lunac, I am situated on the left the Church</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></b><br/><br/></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>                                                   THE  PROJECT :</b></p><b></b><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The first step has been to refurbish two of the floors.

Il faut dire que l'Aveyron est le pays natal de Marie-Chantal ! en 2005 ils m'investissent et je sais alors qu'ils vont me sortir de ma longue léthargie.              ""Siffler en travaillant ...""  :  Quand Michel siffle c'est bon signe !              MON HISTOIRE : petit château de défense du Moyen Age, ancienne propriété de plusieurs co-seigneurs, vassaux des Comtes de Toulouse, je suis de taille humaine, dans un adorable petit village, avec vue magnifique et imprenable sur une nature verdoyante et vallonnée, avec prairies, bois et rivières .... et le climat  y est plutôt clément, sauf février qui est parfois un peu rude.

But my own origin was more humble, as part of a fortified village called Lunac, which I defended alongside its inhabitants for many  generations. Now, sadly, things have changed. In modern times it is hard for me to adapt … I am no longer young and my foundations have become afflicted by a severe  damp, in need of an urgent cure, and unfortunately the revenue generated by my lovely, historic 3 Bed and Breakfasts rooms is insufficient for the purpose. But of late I have become lucky, as many of my masters’ guests and friends have convinced them to launch this call for help through crowdfunding and Indiegogo.2004 : Michel et Marie-Chantal find me !Marie-Chantal is 62 years old and the wifeof an architect, who has passed on to her his passion for restoring ancient buildings. She has a daughter and two grandchildren. Her earlyvocation in education ledher, in the 80’s, to establish one of the first associative and parental nurseries in France. Today, she is the spirit of my rebirth and my adventure.Marie-Chantal : MEDIEVAL MARKET to Sauveterre de Rouergue   Michel, her husband, had previously spent 20 years lovingly restoring a ruined building in Provence back to its original beauty. On retiring, in 2004, at the age of  74, he  and Marie-Chantal finally realised their lifelong dream, which was to own and restore to life a castle in the Aveyron. And it was in that same year they found me abandoned and languishing neglected in the village of Lunac.Why Aveyron ? Because Aveyron was the birthplace of Marie-Chantal, who after many years away was anxious to return to her roots. So, in 2005, after completing my purchase, she came back and, along with Michel, has every day been working to restore me to my original splendour. But the time they have been dreading has finally arrived – they have spent all their life-savings on their project and work on me has almost stopped.But Michel, who will be 82 in January, still carries on alone : he repairs a stone wall here, replaces an old  beam there, repairs a damaged ceiling, checks the dampness in the foundations, but everything would be so much quicker if he was able to employ help. In his dedication, he has already drawn up plans for the work and deserves to live to see his project to fruition.Unfortunately, the income earned from their B & B business is insufficient for the purpose. Now, they need extra support. Marie-Chantal has taken a part-time job selling ‘Energetix’ magnetic jewellery. Soon, we will discover whether or not she is a good sales person.  Also she has  had to start to part with some of the less essential furniture and objects from within my walls.                                                     MY   STORY :As I told you before, I was a small defensive castle constructed as the central part of  the fortified village of  Lunac. I was formely owned by several  co-seigneurs, who were the vassals of the Counts of Toulouse. Since the thirteenth century, I have stood proudly in a lovely little village with magnificent breathtaking views across a rolling, green landscape of meadow, woodland and river valley.  Apart from the winters, which can often be cold, the climate is mild and in the summer hot with cool soothing evenings in which to relax and absorb the fragrance of the co.During the Renaissance,  and in  the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, I was redesigned. A document of  the Parliament of Toulouse, in the  fourteenth century, authorised  the village to “re-fortify the castle“, because   had already suffered disfiguring scars from the rigours of war.  But the nineteenth and twentieth centuries d isfigured me more. Until, I was discovered by Marie-Chantal and Michel who have restored much  f my thirteenth and fourteenth century character. Now, all the false ceilings have been removed, closed-up doorways and covered mullioned windows have been re-opened and plaster replaced by  ime coating. But I have been tastefully modernised too : electricity has been brought up to present-day standard, the water in the taps is running again and modern bathrooms have been integrated into the prevailing style.*A character from my past : The Prefect of Morbian: Sieur De Chazelles, son of Sir de Chazelles, Lord of Lunac, and Lady born ""de Montlauzeur"" * Right: the village of Lunac, I am situated on the left the Church                                                   THE  PROJECT :The first step has been to refurbish two of the floors. Marie-Chantal and Michel live on my first floor where there is now a magnificent dining room, which is shared with guests, as is the large terrace of verlooking a sweep of beautiful countryside. They also have a lovely, historic beamed living room with a large stone fireplace, bedroom, bathroom and small dressing room. On the second floor are the three Bed & Breakfast rooms, which are rented to guests, all with en suit e bathrooms, containing either a shower or bath.  (See www.chateau-lunac.com for further details).The kitchen before and after work by Michel and Marie-ChantalFireplace in the lounge before and after work  TODAY SEES THE NEED for further and very necessary stages in my continued renovation:
because I’m half-buried on the north  side, I need protection from the damp from the rainwater which has been seeping through my walls for centuries and into the windows and under the spiral, stone staircase in the round tower, which needs to be saved from further damage;
 *when this damp problem is solved, my ground floor will be ready to be developed into a medieval style apartment for guests to be able to rent and to enjoy;                                                                                                                                                                The tower, the ""Bakehouse"" left                                                                                                                                                                                               The ""Couvert""                                                                                                                                                                                                   Two rooms for medieval style apartment                                                                                                                                                           *also, I  have several small dependances in need of further : repair a building called the “bakery” because it has a large restored bread oven and smaller pastry oven, which remains in fairly good condition, but the building itself requires attention; and the Couvert,  where in past times the Lord and  the Prior administere  lesser forms of justice on the local people

One cold winter day in the early 1980's he was riding a stationary bike in a basement fitness room. Bored, he closed his eyes and imagined himself pedaling through a 3D wireframe world, a game that challenged him to quickly choose between branching tunnels for points.

<p class=""big_type"">Would you eat, drink, smoke or do a horse? The answer may surprise you in this fast pased fun game designed for your sophomoric senses.</p>
<div class=""full-description"">
<h1>Eat It, Drink It, Smoke It, Do It - The Game is the ultimate party starter and boredom killer. Grab your buddies and start rolling the die.</h1>
<p>Ever since I was a young child I loved to play board games, but somewhere along the way I got bored with board games. I realized that I had grown up, but the board games I loved so much as a child hadn't. After years of throwing noodles at the walls to see what stuck I came up with the idea for a board game that anyone could learn to play in two minutes or less, set up to play in one minute or less and enjoy for a lifetime. <em>Eat It, Drink It, Smoke It, Do It! - The Game</em> came to exist that day.</p>
<p>Every answer to any question in the game's card deck can be answered, ""That could be eaten"" or ""One could potentially drink it"" or ""That could be smoked (like pork ribs or herring)"" or ""A person would do that"". Even if a player cannot deduce the answer, just saying anything yields that player a twenty-five percent chance of winning the game. Some questions are tricky and may have more than one right answer. Also, hidden in each game playing deck are ten Easter Egg questions, those answers are worth twenty times the normal answers value, but they are very difficult to come by.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p>The standard game includes, a one inch color box with instruction book; eight pawns, one deck of three hundred playing cards (expansion packs will be available and the first expansion pack is already-ready-already), and thirty-two award cards plus one die. There is a standard full color board with sixty-four playing squares that have four 'hidden' short cuts to beat your opponent to the end of the game.</p>
<p>The first player to either cross the finish line, or amass four different colored award cards is declared as the winner. </p>

</div></div>","Would you eat, drink, smoke or do a horse? The answer may surprise you in this fast pased fun game designed for your sophomoric senses.

Eat It, Drink It, Smoke It, Do It - The Game is the ultimate party starter and boredom killer. Grab your buddies and start rolling the die.
Ever since I was a young child I loved to play board games, but somewhere along the way I got bored with board games. I realized that I had grown up, but the board games I loved so much as a child hadn't. After years of throwing noodles at the walls to see what stuck I came up with the idea for a board game that anyone could learn to play in two minutes or less, set up to play in one minute or less and enjoy for a lifetime. Eat It, Drink It, Smoke It, Do It! - The Game came to exist that day.
Every answer to any question in the game's card deck can be answered, ""That could be eaten"" or ""One could potentially drink it"" or ""That could be smoked (like pork ribs or herring)"" or ""A person would do that"". Even if a player cannot deduce the answer, just saying anything yields that player a twenty-five percent chance of winning the game. Some questions are tricky and may have more than one right answer. Also, hidden in each game playing deck are ten Easter Egg questions, those answers are worth twenty times the normal answers value, but they are very difficult to come by.

Eat It, Drink It, Smoke It, Do It! - The Game
The standard game includes, a one inch color box with instruction book; eight pawns, one deck of three hundred playing cards (expansion packs will be available and the first expansion pack is already-ready-already), and thirty-two award cards plus one die. There is a standard full color board with sixty-four playing squares that have four 'hidden' short cuts to beat your opponent to the end of the game.
The first player to either cross the finish line, or amass four different colored award cards is declared as the winner.

ruled by a pantheon of mechanical gods, was brought down to its knees by a sudden and devastating war. The gods betrayed each other, civilizations turned to dust, and only the smallest fractions of life could survive the aftermath by turning themselves more machine than man.Eons later mechanized horrors break into a long lost tomb of a dead god, craving after its forbidden powers, bent on creating a demented pantheon of their own.You take control of a reanimated guardian; who now must brave the ancient halls of his creator. Learn what caused the death of an universe, enhance yourself with the powers of your defeated enemies, and prevent history from repeating itself!   INTENSE BOSS FIGHTS
Avernus has Five extremely challenging boss battles, spread throughout the games Four unique and complex dungeons, which can be completed in any order.
Successfully killing one of the great mechanized beasts will reward you with their own special powers, giving you the upper hand against the remaining dangers to come.

Fast-paced and gripping combat, bordering on bullet hell, as you jump from range to melee while trying to weave between swarms of bullets, environmental hazards and puzzles.
Master the game as Avernus will put your skills to the test and lets the truly devoted shine.
 INNATE TELEPORTATION ABILITY
The monsters within the tomb are relentless and will give no quarter. To survive, you must learn their patterns, weaknesses and never stop moving.
Use your special teleportation ability to slip through and between your enemies; live on your feet or die on your knees. 
 CHARACTER PROGRESSION VS. PRESERVATION
Slaying monsters and finding the tombs ancient secrets will reward you with Power.
Energy that can be used for two very important things: permanent upgrades that can make your journey slightly more bearable or burn it to instantly recover from harm.

By backing Avernus you can support it to reach its full potential while securing your digital copy of the game.    Subsolar Entertainment was founded in 2017 and consists of a dedicated bunch of gaming enthusiasts always striving to improve as game developers.For us, games are an art platform, and we wish to hone each of our pieces to perfection. By combining unique, pleasing or even downright strange visuals with prominent combat mechanics and enemy design, we aspire to create something that can produce sense of wonder and leave a lasting memory in the minds of players. Even though the development process of Avernus has already been very enlightening with many lessons learned, there is still much to discover and improve – and this is exactly why we love the gaming industry!We have a principle of open communication, and to stay true to it, we will share development material as often as possible from our games to our Discord community.   Join the Community!",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Although we are seasoned adventurers and avid fantasy football players this is our first outing into the crowdfunding world as team owners.

<p>We are familiar with the delays that can unexpectedly pop up, whether they be due to production, shipping or customs. The estimated delivery date for this project is November 2015, but please keep in mind that this is an informed guess. Also note that due to logistical restrictions in different regions, some backers may receive their pledge rewards before others. We will be doing our utmost to avoid these situations.</p>

<p>It was a dark and stormy night… ehm… no, that’s another story! In a kingdom where princesses are regularly kidnapped by evil masters, heroes begin to run out. On an unlucky day the King’s daughter is kidnapped too! The King spends many days trying to find a young and strong man who is able to rescue her, but he only finds a little knight named Coward, with neither experience nor physical prowess! The King gives him two choices: rescue his daughter and get a huge reward or die! So, Coward looks at the tower, clenches his teeth and gets ready for his new adventure! Will he finally become a true Hero?<br/></p>

In Coward Knight you can move silently or you can run, it’s up to you! If you run you will make noise and enemies could hear you. Instead, if you walk you can sneak silently through the level!

Our little hero can hit and defeat the guards, but be careful! He is smaller and more defenceless then those who keep him apart from his beloved, so you should use your offensive capability with intelligence and strategy.

In Coward Knight you can unlock several goals in every level! For example, you can collect every rupee of every level, improve your score, complete the levels unseen and kill all the guards unheard!

Studio Leaves is a small independent group of people who joined their experiences in order to improve the video game setting in the south of Italy, our small Silicon Valley 2.0. After hours spent playing Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, we came up with the idea of Coward Knight. Even if the programming is self-funded, we need your help in order to pay for other key collaborators, to buy licences and to put the finishing touches to <b>“Coward Knight: A Stealth Adventure”</b>: thus you will be 100% satisfied with our game. Therefore we have chosen IndieGoGo to see our game grow and thrive, as we thought since the beginning!

It was a dark and stormy night… ehm… no, that’s another story! In a kingdom where princesses are regularly kidnapped by evil masters, heroes begin to run out. On an unlucky day the King’s daughter is kidnapped too! The King spends many days trying to find a young and strong man who is able to rescue her, but he only finds a little knight named Coward, with neither experience nor physical prowess! The King gives him two choices: rescue his daughter and get a huge reward or die! So, Coward looks at the tower, clenches his teeth and gets ready for his new adventure! Will he finally become a true Hero?





In Coward Knight you can move silently or you can run, it’s up to you! If you run you will make noise and enemies could hear you. Instead, if you walk you can sneak silently through the level!
                               Walk                                                                Run!




Our little hero can hit and defeat the guards, but be careful! He is smaller and more defenceless then those who keep him apart from his beloved, so you should use your offensive capability with intelligence and strategy.









In Coward Knight you can unlock several goals in every level! For example, you can collect every rupee of every level, improve your score, complete the levels unseen and kill all the guards unheard!

The levels are full of dreadful traps, like thorns, noisy worms, dangerous axes and many other insidious dangers.





Axes!




Bombs!










Spikes!


In the dangerous levels, besides death traps, you can find magic power-ups too that improve some skills, for example speed, or give you other skills, like invisibility.
     Besides traps, there are a lot of enemies that will try their best to stop you!




CowardThis little warrior has never distinguished himself as a courageous and strong knight. Unfortunately all the other knights have already been defeated by the evil master, so he has no option but to fight. In spite of his slight build, he is very skilful in the use of the sword, but he finds it difficult to face his enemies openly: you will better attack them in the rear!


Final Boss This mysterious and terrible monster is greedy for young princesses, he loves to eat them with onions and carrots! He fears nothing and he has faced all the knights the King sent him. He has many aces in his sleeve and he feels invincible at the top of his tower. Will Coward snatch the princess from his clutches?







PrincessAs in every fairy tale, the princess is beautiful like a goddess and bewitches everyone who looks at her. Unfortunately she has attracted the attention of the evil master too, who wants to prepare a big banquet with the princess as the main dish....


GuardsThese fearful muscle mountains are everywhere through the levels, and they will try to stop you from reaching the beloved Princess! Coward is very skilful in the use of the sword and with technique he can defeat them! But remember, the bigger they are, the louder they fall.


Flying EyesThese flying eyes cannot move, but they never take their eyes off! They cannot attack you, but be careful, because if they see you, they will attract every nearby guard!  


JellyfishThese disgusting creatures float everywhere through the levels. The worse thing is that, thanks to their shape, they can see 360 degrees! You should pay attention and avoid being too close to them! 


BansheeHey, you look like you’ve seen a ghost! Well, there are also ghosts that terrify our little spineless warrior with their terrible screaming!


SnailThese funny creatures wander about the levels carrying weak lights. There are some levels without any light, so you will be very lucky if you find one of these snails!



WormsWhat a disgusting creatures! These revolting one-eyed invertebrates are harmless, but if you trample on them, they will make loud noises and everyone around you will notice you! Be careful!

The setting of Coward Knight is a castle; there are 4 worlds, each of them is made up of 12 levels, with a total of 48 levels.

Here you can hear 2 tracks of the game’s soundtrack, available with the Count (and higher) reward.





The soundtrack has been entirely recorded at Sun Keeper Studio. Visit the website:

Studio Leaves is a small independent group of people who joined their experiences in order to improve the video game setting in the south of Italy, our small Silicon Valley 2.0. After hours spent playing Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda, we came up with the idea of Coward Knight. Even if the programming is self-funded, we need your help in order to pay for other key collaborators, to buy licences and to put the finishing touches to “Coward Knight: A Stealth Adventure”: thus you will be 100% satisfied with our game. Therefore we have chosen IndieGoGo to see our game grow and thrive, as we thought since the beginning!

Wizarm is a neo device, a kind of magic box packed with great features, incredibly powerful but yet as easy to use as your phone when it comes to capturing or recording a 2D or 3D movie clip.




Simply connect any HDMI source device and select Screenshot or Video clip as you would do on your smartphone's camera app, click the button and it starts recording! (as shown above, below and here).
Recorded digital video clips are stored and auto-magically scaled (if required by user) for your immediate or later playback and sharing.
Update 15 Nov. 2013: Wizarm is recording the PS4 HDMI output just like it does on the PS3.







Now you can handle, support, manage and record all latest video standards — from SD to Full HD 1080p60 and up to QuadHD(1440p)!  It redefines the current HD-PVR and DVR paradigm. 


Controlled entirely from a KB/mouse combo, a PS3/X360 pad, an Android phone or even from a Win/Mac/Linux computer, Wizarm combines an innovating recording, pass-through, scaling and overlay processing for digital video, on the Android/Ubuntu platform, with a PC-like connectivity, performance and features.




""There are already lots of devices out in the market that allows consumers to run Android apps on their TV, some even priced as low as $30, but none might be as powerful as the Wizarm"" - TheDroidGuy.com

""While the specs alone are enough to help set this box apart from the crowd, the ability to act as a high-definition digital video recorder is probably its most unusual characteristic"" - Liliputing.com
""It can process and store recorded video, as well as capture and enhance the video signal with features like scaling and overlay processing. Starting at $259, the box is touted for offering some features found only on PC video capture cards that cost hundreds of dollars more."" - Linuxgizmos.com
""The possibilities are exceptionals and beyond the current standards of digital players, workstations and Android game consoles, the Wizarm offers a real platform to become more than just a DVR, ...The Holy Grail of TV box is at your fingertips"" - MiniMachines.net (in french)




Are you looking for playing games, browsing the net or running apps and media center on the big Full or Quad HD screen? Either the standard/classic use or the most advanced one like streaming, scaling, capturing, recording, overlay. Wizarm provides them all into one powerful weapon of mass entertainment.


Wizarm is fully open source with a monthly independent and rewarded dev contest as an incentive to bring creativity around its hardware magic. Rooted out of the box and super easy (4 screws) to access either the Mainboard or the SATA3 SSD HDD bay on the other side. Completely silent with a passive cooling system. 

 

Wizarm have the hardware design to fully take advantage of its inner magic, with SATA3 (for SSD HDD 2″5), 6 USB ports (2x USB3.0), SDHC/SDXC connector, Display port output, HDMI input/output connectors, Microphone and earphone connectors, Optical Sound, Gigabit Ethernet, Dual Wifi, Bluetooth 4.0, IR and more…




Featuring the almighty Exynos5 Dual Core ARM Cortex A15 up to 2 GHz (also found on the Nexus10), a quad core ARM Mali T604 GPU @ 533 MHz, 2 GB RAM (DDR3) and 16GB on board eMMC 4.5, Wizarm is nothing but smooth, fluid and responsive.




We believe that everyone — not just the professionals or the wealthy — should have the ability to properly convert, scale, customize and record digital streams. We engaged in the product and user experience design of Wizarm with the following principles in mind:





Digital recording should not be frustrating or hard. Wizarm provides a bleeding marvelous HDMI input that feeds the Camera input of the Exynos5 SoC. Never before handling of digital video stream has been that easy! Retrieve your incoming video stream from most of the camera software available for android phone or tablet. If you can use a smartphone, you can use Wizarm.



An amazing pro scaler is included thus allowing a whole new type of digital control, whatever digital input is throw in, end users now have the ability to determine the output resolution of their choice, while still having the capability to determine a similar or different recording resolution. It’s flexible and versatile!





Looking to add some fun or informative content to your digital stream, WiZARM is giving you that possibility; freely choose the on screen location to add graphics, web elements, picture in picture and more. Create a truly unique and customized digital stream for you, your friends or your internet audience.




 

 






We set out to change the game in the PVR/DVR and android STB market by designing a synergistic solution that brings brand new features and addresses the major consumer pain points of existing products.
Wizarm provides state of the art PVR/DVR and capture features while giving the ability to the users to benefit of various others advanced features such as Scaling, Overlay, Media center, Gaming, Computer, Dev. Board.









Here's a breakdown of the perks you can choose from when you support this campaign (select your perk from the sidebar at the top of this page). All perks listed below include at least one brand new Wizarm.










In addition to our core team, briefly presented in our first video above, we've assembled and still looking to expand, an incredible group of engineers, designers, and industry experts who are collaborating with us to create the best possible hardware. 
Wizarm is hiring! Software&hardware engineers, talented people, brillant hackers: come join our core team! E-mail us at jobs@wizarm.com






We are citizens of the world, we love our children and we respect human beings and their dignity. For those obvious reasons, we selected a Taiwan located factory for the Wizarm production. Also, we carefully selected 99% of the Wizarm components in Taiwan, Japan and South Korea exclusively. Not only a sign of quality, it's a sign of respect towards the human dignity.  








 


We currently have several working prototypes on Android 4.2 and we're now focused on:


Polishing the Android software for release on the final product
Developing mobile app for remote control and wireless stream
Developing the recovery/backup/format/partition tools and menu.
Adding Ubuntu

We will soon begin the process of:

Designing packaging
Getting product certifications
Tooling
Materials procurement
Mass Production







We have been working on Wizarm for the past 18 months and we've come a long way. But now we need your help. Your support will allow us to initiate tooling and order components for manufacturing so we can make Wizarm available to you and the thousands of people who have never before had a digital recording solution. Let's make our digital life easier, our TV smarter and our streams brighter — together.





So why should you support us?


Be the first to get one (and we mean it).
You're looking for a digital companion, a secondary computer to handle some tasks such as capturing, web, email, ftp, games, streaming and so on...
You’ve never had DVR/PVR, digital recording solution, smart mediacenter, android stb before and think it’s awesome to have a simple and beautiful way to connect and enjoy your equipment.










There is quite a few great things possible when the production reaches successful numbers, if our campaign ever goes beyond expectations, we will be able to provide exciting bodywork and stand for your Wizarm.


If such wizardry ever happens, thanx to your support, we will contact all the magicians out there that make it happen, so they can select a bodywork or color of their choice.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Miroslav and I've created <b>Supernova </b>in one day. You can play it here: <a href=""http://supernova.pixelablaze.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://supernova.pixelablaze.com/</a>. </p>
<p>Other than that, I'm a game developer, living quite happily in Serbia.</p>
<p>Now, this is my game but I want you to help it grow further, as it would very much like to. Now, what's the fuss? What is this game striving to become? Well, it can't be summed up in one word but the short description (<i>...the intellectual mindchild it strives to be. Riddled with emptiness, piano chords and philosophy</i>) is kind of it. You can play it with one finger only, but to feel it, you have to give yourself whole.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163452/files/20131030045331-trailer2.png?1383134011"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When I first made Supernova into a playable thing, I felt </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">right</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> about it and I continue to feel so. It's a fast game that you can play without thinking about it, but - it's also a journey through the void, where the enemy becomes uncertain of what and why you are fighting. I want to add to that: to add levels, vast spaces that can be explored; add size to depth, make it immense. Go play it for a while and then come back here to imagine a world in that space. Giant monuments of lost civilizations, scrapyards in the depths of space, the slow rotating and humming cycles of an ancient mechanism, lost to time</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. This and more, could be your work, if you contribute.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>Supernova is made with Unity3D, the free edition. I went through a lot of trouble to make it look as wonderful (it does, right?) as I could, but it could be even greater. When the ships warp in, time-space could ripple, structures could bend space around them and a lot of breathtaking visual moments could be added. For this, I would need <b>Unity3D Pro</b>, which costs $1,500.</p>
<p>If I had to write it all down, the game would get something along the lines of:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>levels - not just fully random blank space like now,</li>

<li>a plot much larger than the 30 sentences,</li>
<li>epic scale of surroundings,</li>
<li>the full feeling of loneliness only space can bring...</li>
</ul>
<p>If you really had to ask, I like to think of it as a little bit like <i>Journey</i>, if you were hunted down through space in <i>Journey </i>from time to time. Of course, it's completely different and is more akin to some minimalistic space roguelike, but the feeling is what's important.</p>
<p>The demo you can see now is the part where you are hunted, with limited storyline exposure and focused on battling through hordes of enemies. I can promise that the game wouldn't be based on this, rather using it as a shift in dynamics, from exploring to combat, back to exploring.</p>
<p>I'd want to do this <b>full time</b> and pay some people to do some<i> fine art stuff</i>, so the rest of the money would go into keeping us alive and well while coding and refining the details. I made this in a day, imagine what a month could bring you. Also, for those worried about losing this style: the concept of minimalism stays, it's what can be built out of that minimalism that's getting paid.</p>
<p>If the goal isn't reached, the funding is still going to this game, to try and buy Unity3D and pay some fine people less than they deserve. If, however, we get more, there's oh so much we can do:</p>
<p><b>Unity Pro Android</b> costs $1500, so we could deliver this game to your android phones in all of it's splendid graphics and visuals that we can make with Unity Pro.</p>
<p><b>Unity Pro iOS</b> costs $1500 and afterwards, your nice iPhone or tablet can enjoy some heavy-duty supernova experience.</p>
<p>The perks are made so that you can choose what you want to give your money to: if you'd want us spend your money on, say, iOS more than Android, pick iOS perks and we'll see to buy that one sooner and go with that. It's our plan to roll this game out on all major platforms and, let me tell you, it's much better to play on a touch-sensitive device.</p>

Hi, I'm Miroslav and I've created Supernova in one day. You can play it here: http://supernova.pixelablaze.com/. 
Other than that, I'm a game developer, living quite happily in Serbia.
Now, this is my game but I want you to help it grow further, as it would very much like to. Now, what's the fuss? What is this game striving to become? Well, it can't be summed up in one word but the short description (...the intellectual mindchild it strives to be. Riddled with emptiness, piano chords and philosophy) is kind of it. You can play it with one finger only, but to feel it, you have to give yourself whole.



When I first made Supernova into a playable thing, I felt right about it and I continue to feel so. It's a fast game that you can play without thinking about it, but - it's also a journey through the void, where the enemy becomes uncertain of what and why you are fighting. I want to add to that: to add levels, vast spaces that can be explored; add size to depth, make it immense. Go play it for a while and then come back here to imagine a world in that space. Giant monuments of lost civilizations, scrapyards in the depths of space, the slow rotating and humming cycles of an ancient mechanism, lost to time. This and more, could be your work, if you contribute.
What We Need & What You Get
Supernova is made with Unity3D, the free edition. I went through a lot of trouble to make it look as wonderful (it does, right?) as I could, but it could be even greater. When the ships warp in, time-space could ripple, structures could bend space around them and a lot of breathtaking visual moments could be added. For this, I would need Unity3D Pro, which costs $1,500.
If I had to write it all down, the game would get something along the lines of:


levels - not just fully random blank space like now,
more enemy variations, 
more things to save your life,
a plot much larger than the 30 sentences,
epic scale of surroundings,
the full feeling of loneliness only space can bring...

If you really had to ask, I like to think of it as a little bit like Journey, if you were hunted down through space in Journey from time to time. Of course, it's completely different and is more akin to some minimalistic space roguelike, but the feeling is what's important.
The demo you can see now is the part where you are hunted, with limited storyline exposure and focused on battling through hordes of enemies. I can promise that the game wouldn't be based on this, rather using it as a shift in dynamics, from exploring to combat, back to exploring.
I'd want to do this full time and pay some people to do some fine art stuff, so the rest of the money would go into keeping us alive and well while coding and refining the details. I made this in a day, imagine what a month could bring you. Also, for those worried about losing this style: the concept of minimalism stays, it's what can be built out of that minimalism that's getting paid.
If the goal isn't reached, the funding is still going to this game, to try and buy Unity3D and pay some fine people less than they deserve. If, however, we get more, there's oh so much we can do:
Unity Pro Android costs $1500, so we could deliver this game to your android phones in all of it's splendid graphics and visuals that we can make with Unity Pro.
Unity Pro iOS costs $1500 and afterwards, your nice iPhone or tablet can enjoy some heavy-duty supernova experience.
The perks are made so that you can choose what you want to give your money to: if you'd want us spend your money on, say, iOS more than Android, pick iOS perks and we'll see to buy that one sooner and go with that. It's our plan to roll this game out on all major platforms and, let me tell you, it's much better to play on a touch-sensitive device.


Now, the perks:
Starter perks


The ""I enjoyed the game, keep it coming"" perk ($2) tells me that you've enjoyed playing the game and that you appreciate the time and effort. I say thank you, dear player and know that it will keep coming. For this perk, you get a personal thank you from me.

The ""I want more!"" perk ($10) is where it's at! You clearly want more and I plan to hold to that. A personal thank you from me and a free digital download of the game is what you get!



Intermediate perks



The ""I WANT MOAR!"" perk ($25) gets you the game, once it's out, but before anyone else. You get it and you're in it, and you get a personal thank you in the game, redefining your goals.

The ""I WANT MOAR... on Android!"" perk ($25) is exactly like the previous one, but it lets us know that you want your money to go into Android development.

The ""I WANT MOAR... on iOS!"" perk ($25) is exactly like the other two, just with your cash going to iOS development. Neat!

Advanced perks


The ""Philosopher"" perk ($500) let's you get an all-you-can-eat of our game, to spread it as far as you can, an in-game thank you, a written thank you and a copy of the Supernova limited-edition Thought Book, which will have great in-game moments caught in snapshots, a lot of thoughts (obviously) around that, our thank-you's written all over the place, fine paper and ink, sketches, diagrams, ideas, well - just about everything you could find on our desks while working.

The ""Designer"" perk ($1000) gets you all of the above and more, giving you a chance to add your own idea to the project, be it a new enemy ship, new philosophical sentences or ideas, new levels or tones - you're in. Your signature ends up in the Thought Book, too.

The ""Pro"" perk ($1500) gets us Unity Pro, plain and simple, and you get everything. No, I mean it.

The ""Android"" perk ($1500) gets us Unity Pro Android and you get the same as with the above. You're great and you've pushed in such a great way that we could write books about it.

The ""iOS"" perk ($1500) gets us the Unity Pro iOS and we can now go further, creating beautiful things on beautiful devices. They're quite a match, right? You get everything we said above.

The ""Fan Pit"" perk ($4000) you get a ticket to come and spend some time with us, we'll hand you all of the above when we meet and you can just relax and be a part of something great. Supernova becomes a real supernova because of you.



The Impact
I love great games. I really, really, love the feeling a great game can get you in. It's a one-of-a-kind thing to see yourself feel a moment in the game and observe what kind of gravity and grasp it has on you.

If you have some incredible ideas and concepts that would make this game truly amazing, and have found the same passion for the idea that we have, then naturally, we would recommend our top two packages. Although they might be a lot of money, these guarantee you some incredible creative input without the hassle of mis-communication and inbox pile-ups. However, we understand many people are unable to make such generous donations, so in that case, if you fancy some limited edition merchandise and a special in-game perk, then we feel that our 'Artisan' through to 'Mason' packages might be the perk for you! If you like the idea, but are a little unsure about making a major donation, then every £5 can go a long way for us. This will get you a copy of the 'Innovate' demo upon release, and full access to the game for you to play and review, along with all future updates. In many ways, this is equally as important to us. All of your feedback is read and acted upon, whether it's a bug or a suggestion. So whatever your choice, we thank you for your donation to our cause. All copies of the game will be available as soon as we release our first public demo, which should be shortly after the end of this campaign. Any other physical rewards will be with you as soon as possible after the end of the campaign. We will be sure to keep you informed via email of any other updates and details.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><i>Why Donate?</i></h2><p>With your help and support, we will be able to fully develop 'Innovate' to it's maximum potential. Here you will find a breakdown of how we plan to utilize the funding we hope to receive:</p><p><b>Unity Pro</b> - This will allow us to use the unity engine to its maximum potential.</p><p><b>Adobe Creative Cloud Account</b> - We will be able to make higher quality graphics, art and visual effects.</p><p><b>Hardware</b> - Tablets, hard-drives, graphics cards and PC's, they all come with a cost. We hope to be able to fully equip our team with everything they need to make 'Innovate' an experience of the highest quality.</p><p><b>Dropbox Team Licence</b> - Cloud storage enables us to communicate, store and transfer files to work more effectively as a team. This makes the movement of assets and files from one machine to another much faster.</p><p><b>Unity Assets</b> - The vast quantity of unity assets available online mean that we can adapt and learn to improve the game for you. </p><p><b>Eurogamer Expo 2014</b> - To make 'Innovate' a reality would be incredible, but to have it showcased at the UK's largest gaming expo in London? This would be truly phenomenal. It would be a fantastic opportunity for us to meet and have a chat to all of you, discuss your ideas, and for you all to have a play of Innovate.</p><p><b>Advertising &amp; Marketing</b> -  The majority of our advertising will be online. For this reason, we encourage you to play and record videos, show your friends tell them about 'Innovate'. However a percentage of our funds will go towards website advertising through platforms such as YouTube and other social media.</p>      <p></p><p><br/></p><h2>ProjectKlowd Game Studios:</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><blockquote style=""text-align: center;"">'The volunteers at ProjectKlowd have been working together for the last two years.

Our physics based crafting system allows for the intricate and realistic crafting you've always wanted from a game. Uniquely developed by ProjectKlowd, this never before seen system allows the player to take what resources they have gathered and then experiment and discover their applications using a 3D work bench interface. Using a variety of tools and components, the player can gradually build up their skills by crafting more and more challenging contraptions. Whether it's a chisel, hatchet or bridge, the planning and construction is all done via a 'hands on' physics experience.                        Choose your path, with a skill tree that will take you down one of many different career paths, each altering your gameplay as you train your skills in different areas.As the player, you begin with nothing. Living out of a shed, you must gather basic resources and materials which you can experiment with, though trial and error. Learn and unlock the abilities to craft components using the unique 3D physics interface, and use raw materials to build structures in order to establish trade routes and open up a whole world of jobs, contracts and opportunities. While progressing and developing your skills, you will unlock and be able to achieve bigger and more challenging tasks which lie around every corner. You have one goal in sight, to become a Master Craftsman.  Multiplayer gameplay will be available at a later date, to allow you and your friends to craft and build much larger items and structures on a grander scale. start with nothing and develop your skills until you build a busy town and expand into an in-game commerce system, where you can get paid for your work by in-game NPC's (non-player characters)The Innovate team are campaigning here on Indiegogo to raise funds to develop our game, and these funds will allow us to pay for a whole heap more features that we can implement, as well as better software and hardware to aid with the development.Innovate is being developed in the Unity 3D Engine, however we require Unity Pro in order to develop the quality of our game a lot further. We hope that Indiegogo can help us in achieving this, and allow us to get more professionals onboard with the team, to assist with specialised applications to get certain features implemented into the game.What Is The Right Package For Me?This all depends on how you feel about this project and its team. If you have some incredible ideas and concepts that would make this game truly amazing, and have found the same passion for the idea that we have, then naturally, we would recommend our top two packages. Although they might be a lot of money, these guarantee you some incredible creative input without the hassle of mis-communication and inbox pile-ups. However, we understand many people are unable to make such generous donations, so in that case, if you fancy some limited edition merchandise and a special in-game perk, then we feel that our 'Artisan' through to 'Mason' packages might be the perk for you! If you like the idea, but are a little unsure about making a major donation, then every £5 can go a long way for us. This will get you a copy of the 'Innovate' demo upon release, and full access to the game for you to play and review, along with all future updates. In many ways, this is equally as important to us. All of your feedback is read and acted upon, whether it's a bug or a suggestion. So whatever your choice, we thank you for your donation to our cause. All copies of the game will be available as soon as we release our first public demo, which should be shortly after the end of this campaign. Any other physical rewards will be with you as soon as possible after the end of the campaign. We will be sure to keep you informed via email of any other updates and details.Why Donate?With your help and support, we will be able to fully develop 'Innovate' to it's maximum potential. Here you will find a breakdown of how we plan to utilize the funding we hope to receive:Unity Pro - This will allow us to use the unity engine to its maximum potential.Adobe Creative Cloud Account - We will be able to make higher quality graphics, art and visual effects.Hardware - Tablets, hard-drives, graphics cards and PC's, they all come with a cost. We hope to be able to fully equip our team with everything they need to make 'Innovate' an experience of the highest quality.Dropbox Team Licence - Cloud storage enables us to communicate, store and transfer files to work more effectively as a team. This makes the movement of assets and files from one machine to another much faster.Unity Assets - The vast quantity of unity assets available online mean that we can adapt and learn to improve the game for you. Eurogamer Expo 2014 - To make 'Innovate' a reality would be incredible, but to have it showcased at the UK's largest gaming expo in London? This would be truly phenomenal. It would be a fantastic opportunity for us to meet and have a chat to all of you, discuss your ideas, and for you all to have a play of Innovate.Advertising & Marketing -  The majority of our advertising will be online. For this reason, we encourage you to play and record videos, show your friends tell them about 'Innovate'. However a percentage of our funds will go towards website advertising through platforms such as YouTube and other social media.      ProjectKlowd Game Studios:'The volunteers at ProjectKlowd have been working together for the last two years. Innovate is the project we'd really love to bring to life. The one we want to become reality. Your donations will help us to not only achieve this, but will allow us to fulfil our dream: to make high quality games for the gaming community. Whether you're a 'Junior Craftsman' or a 'Master Craftsman', You can help us to achieve our goal' - Charlie BensonStill Want To Help Us?

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.2; padding: 0px;"">In Status Quo: The Chronicle of Agent White, the player takes control of Agent Maddison White, a spoiled rich kid who ran away from home to avoid becoming her parents' idea of perfect.  After joining the Terran Defense Corporation, White becomes an agent trained to protect Humans wherever they colonize in space.  What she hoped would be a “blow-off” assignment becomes a tragic fight to save colonists under the threat of alien invasion; teaching her the value of Human life and her role in protecting it.  </p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.2; padding: 0px;"">What makes Agent White a solid leading character is the fact that she is an identifiable female protagonist, in the same vein as Buffy and other favorites, who is likeable, funny, and vulnerable; but strong and capable of keeping a world from being torn apart by alien invasion.  Her character will speak for itself, without the need for big boobs, skimpy uniform, or an over-sexualized persona.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.2; padding: 0px;"">While the game has strong elements of first or third person shooters, Miffed Kitty Press also wants to integrate a valuable part of the table-top gaming experience: the character sheet.  Known in SQ as the ""Template"", this aspect of gameplay has a striking impact on the player's experience and how they choose to play the game.  Players may adopt classes that make them a great pilot, a gun toting bad-ass, a medic, a leader capable of commanding “NPCs”, techs who are solid repairmen; or any combination of them all.  The Template allows for limitless replay value, urging players to think on their feet, and try gameplay styles they never would have considered in other first person shooters.  </p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.2; padding: 0px;"">During the single player campaign players assume the role of Agent Maddison White, but this is only the beginning.   After completion of the single player campaign, other modes will be unlocked, along with another single player campaign that allows the player to assume the role of an invading Ji broodling (or one of her thousands of sisters).   Character customization becomes a vital part of the gameplay in multiplayer, encouraging the player to customize their “toon” for every match; changing load-outs or adding points to classes and skills they will need on the battlefield.  As the series continues, 24 races will take the field, each with new abilities, classes, and gear.</p>

<p style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; line-height: 1.2; padding: 0px;"">On the battlefield, a soldier itself is the best weapon; but it never hurts to have a lot of firepower.  Status Quo will feature dozens of weapons, vehicles, tool-sets, and equipment to further customize the gameplay experience.  Money will be earned in game by saving the lives of the colonists.  The more of them that stay alive, the more money the player gets to buy better gear.</p>

Based on the Template System in <em>Status Quo: Chronicles of a Universe at War</em>, the integration of this stats, skills, and classes system will allow players to track progress, compare stats with friends, and improve their situational skills.</p>

Put simply, it will put food on artists' tables.  This <span style=""color: #333333;"">IndieGoGo</span> fundraiser is not an investment or charity.  It is an exchange: funds from fans for rewards from Miffed Kitty Press.  It's a great funding mechanism for indie projects: if we don't reach our financial goal, we still get to keep what we raise and keep moving forward.</p>

In Status Quo: The Chronicle of Agent White, the player takes control of Agent Maddison White, a spoiled rich kid who ran away from home to avoid becoming her parents' idea of perfect.  After joining the Terran Defense Corporation, White becomes an agent trained to protect Humans wherever they colonize in space.  What she hoped would be a “blow-off” assignment becomes a tragic fight to save colonists under the threat of alien invasion; teaching her the value of Human life and her role in protecting it.  
What makes Agent White a solid leading character is the fact that she is an identifiable female protagonist, in the same vein as Buffy and other favorites, who is likeable, funny, and vulnerable; but strong and capable of keeping a world from being torn apart by alien invasion.  Her character will speak for itself, without the need for big boobs, skimpy uniform, or an over-sexualized persona.
 

 
While the game has strong elements of first or third person shooters, Miffed Kitty Press also wants to integrate a valuable part of the table-top gaming experience: the character sheet.  Known in SQ as the ""Template"", this aspect of gameplay has a striking impact on the player's experience and how they choose to play the game.  Players may adopt classes that make them a great pilot, a gun toting bad-ass, a medic, a leader capable of commanding “NPCs”, techs who are solid repairmen; or any combination of them all.  The Template allows for limitless replay value, urging players to think on their feet, and try gameplay styles they never would have considered in other first person shooters.  
There will even be a way to finish the game and save lives without ever firing a shot.


 
During the single player campaign players assume the role of Agent Maddison White, but this is only the beginning.   After completion of the single player campaign, other modes will be unlocked, along with another single player campaign that allows the player to assume the role of an invading Ji broodling (or one of her thousands of sisters).   Character customization becomes a vital part of the gameplay in multiplayer, encouraging the player to customize their “toon” for every match; changing load-outs or adding points to classes and skills they will need on the battlefield.  As the series continues, 24 races will take the field, each with new abilities, classes, and gear.
 

 
On the battlefield, a soldier itself is the best weapon; but it never hurts to have a lot of firepower.  Status Quo will feature dozens of weapons, vehicles, tool-sets, and equipment to further customize the gameplay experience.  Money will be earned in game by saving the lives of the colonists.  The more of them that stay alive, the more money the player gets to buy better gear.
 

 
Status Quo pushes the Unreal Engine to its limits, taking advantage of new features of the Unreal Developer's Kit.  Agent White and players of co-op or competitive multiplayer will have a huge sandbox to battle in, breaking down into over a dozen smaller maps for a variety of game modes and types.
 
DEVELOPMENT

 
Status Quo in its current form as a video game is incomplete, but it has the potential to become a groundbreaking single and multiplayer experience for a variety of audiences, from casual to avid gamers.  The Template System is in development now, and has the potential to gather a massive player community driven by bragging rights and collective accomplishment. Based on the Template System in Status Quo: Chronicles of a Universe at War, the integration of this stats, skills, and classes system will allow players to track progress, compare stats with friends, and improve their situational skills.
We intend to make Status Quo available on our website, as well as any other digital distribution platform worth consideration (such as Steam, etc).  This would allow for an ever growing community, as the player base grows and as the universe expands with each new title released.

PLEDGING

 
Your contributions will help pay for the following:
Continued Development: It costs money to keep a project like this going.  Contributions like yours allow us to keep working and moving forward on the SQ Project.  With your help, this one game could grow into a series that fans around the world can stand behind.
Software Licensing: Licensing isn't cheap, and we can only do so much with open source software.  We need the right tools for the job.  Considering the average cost of the software we use ranges from $700 to $7,500 per seat, we need all the help we can get.
Server Costs: Storage is important for development, and it isn't cheap. Once we open up for multiplayer testing, these costs will only go up.
Marketing and Advertising: We want to reach anyone who craves new and innovative science fiction gaming.  This means putting ads on websites, in magazines, and even on networks like G4 and MTV; and that takes cash... lots of it.
Legal and Accounting Consideration: We have to protect ourselves, and keep everything properly documented just as any other legitimate company would.
 
In the end, what we need the most is you. 
Up until now we have developed Status Quo using money from the sale of the original source book on Amazon, and from generous contributors like you.  These sales have brought us this far, but we still have a long way to go before our playable alpha is ready to show potential investors.  With pledge money received from  IndieGoGo, we hope to cover the various costs associated with creating a video game; from licensing the Unreal Developer's Kit and other software suites, continued development and maintenance efforts, and being a valuable member of our community by helping local artists to pay their rent while doing more great work for us.  We have delved deeply into our own pockets, and now we need a boost to continue making this project a reality.  
We know that our current goal will not even come close to allowing us to fully produce the game, but your contributions will help support this project and permit our team to have the tools necessary to continue forward.  Any amount donated in excess of our IndieGoGo goal will soften the financial strain on Miffed Kitty Press, and allow us broader access to more artists, tools, creative space, and hardware... Put simply, it will put food on artists' tables.  This IndieGoGo fundraiser is not an investment or charity.  It is an exchange: funds from fans for rewards from Miffed Kitty Press.  It's a great funding mechanism for indie projects: if we don't reach our financial goal, we still get to keep what we raise and keep moving forward.
Together we can accomplish what any single one of us cannot do alone.  With help from you and contributors like you, we can build a company, help artists and creative people feed their families, and work to produce something that people around the world can enjoy.
Even if you aren't able to contribute by pledging, you can help us out by showing support: Like us on Facebook!

Thanks for your time and attention.  Help us make this dream a reality!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, my name is Adrian Banninga, founder of Allgraf and Game director of Darkout. I would like to take a moment and tell you a little bit about myself and the team, and why we need your support to make Darkout a success.</p>
<p><br/>Behind Allgraf, the name I used for my previous freelance works, there is a bunch of 9 people from all over the world who joined me on this project that I’m passionate about. All of them have been working for more than a year on Darkout with a royalty-based contract. <br/><br/>At this present moment, we wanted to start the sales for the game in its beta version on our website, because none of the team members have any funding and we need all the support we can muster from the game community in order to complete the game with as many features as possible for the initial release. <br/><br/>As you could  guess, we are not asking for a lot of money in our campaign, and the main reason is because money is not the main focus of our campaign. However, I have been working in this industry for 12 years, I have spent most of that time working on big budget games (UT2004, 007 Nightfire, Forza Horizon, among others) for big companies where gamers’ feedback is not really taken into account. <br/><br/>Here with our small and humble game Darkout we want to give you more than only a digital piece of entertainment. I’ve always wanted to let the community be a part of the game. The way to do that is by offering the chance to come up with new ideas about weapons and other new elements so that gamers can discuss them with the team. In this way we will be able to make the game you would love to play.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>About Us:</b></p><p>     We are a group of people who loved to play a Minecraft gamemode entitled MCSmash which was based upon the game Super Smash Bros. MCSmash was made by Minecraft PVP (aka. Kookaburra Technology Inc.) , a minecraft server community, on February 12th 2013 and all of us at Smash PVP absolutely loved it! We had about 9 months of Smash, and we played and played for hours. Then in early November MCSmash was announced closed, it wasn't receiving enough profit, the main coder had left and it's player base was steadily declining. We were all so saddened. After a few days of the server being closed, Smash PVP was created, We are all the most enthusiastic smash players and really hope to bring back the amazing and wonderful gamemode once called MCSmash. We are now nearing the end of the coding stage and need your help to help us get this project rolling. All of the funds will be going into the server hosting and other things that will make the experience even better.<br/></p><p>     I <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/3658674/x/3658674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harris Rothaermel</a> (aka. 22vortex22) am the owner of Smash PVP,  I am a student but I spend most of my free time coding and playing video games. I was a very dedicated MCSmash player and I am still active in many communities. Helping me with this server are Peter (aka. WasabiLover), <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/6468198/x/3658674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clay</a><b> </b>(aka.

Chris is the social media admin who makes sure you guys always stay informed and up to date.Clay is the community admin, he deals with players, the forums and other things.  We have no other staff right now but we will be always watching for potential staff.</p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Smash:</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383942/files/20140220194129-smash.jpg?1392954089"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p>     Smash was a gamemode made by Minecraft PVP based on the game Super Smash Brothers. The aim was to knock your competitors off the map with a range of buffs and a variety of kits. The more damage you took the farther back you would be backed up. You would keep on getting knocked off the arena but you would need to try and get back onto the map using your double jump rocket which is given to everyone. It was a fast paced, action packed game of you trying to knock other people off the battlefield but keeping yourself alive as well. We used to have tons of fun playing together as a community. We had separate teams and there would be tournaments. All smash players formed a family, the best family. We would spend hours of fun times together. You could become a part of this great community, made by the people who created the original one.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Progress:</b></p><p><b>     </b>We are working very hard to get this server up and running as fast as possible.

This is only limited since only 10 people can buy it.  <p></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">  <b>Social Media:</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;font-size: 15px;"">Keep up and track with us by following our social</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;font-size: 15px;""> pages!</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><a href=""http://instagram.com/smashpvpnetwork"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://instagram.com/smashpvpnetwork</a><br/></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SmashPVPNetwork"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/SmashPVPNetwork</a></b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><a href=""https://twitter.com/SmashPVPNetwork"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/SmashPVPNetwork</a></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/smashpvpnetwork"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/smashpvpnetwork</a></b></p><p></p><p></p></div>","About Us:     We are a group of people who loved to play a Minecraft gamemode entitled MCSmash which was based upon the game Super Smash Bros. MCSmash was made by Minecraft PVP (aka. Kookaburra Technology Inc.) , a minecraft server community, on February 12th 2013 and all of us at Smash PVP absolutely loved it! We had about 9 months of Smash, and we played and played for hours. Then in early November MCSmash was announced closed, it wasn't receiving enough profit, the main coder had left and it's player base was steadily declining. We were all so saddened. After a few days of the server being closed, Smash PVP was created, We are all the most enthusiastic smash players and really hope to bring back the amazing and wonderful gamemode once called MCSmash. We are now nearing the end of the coding stage and need your help to help us get this project rolling. All of the funds will be going into the server hosting and other things that will make the experience even better.     I Harris Rothaermel (aka. 22vortex22) am the owner of Smash PVP,  I am a student but I spend most of my free time coding and playing video games. I was a very dedicated MCSmash player and I am still active in many communities. Helping me with this server are Peter (aka. WasabiLover), Clay (aka. VikingClay), Chris (aka. Cbenfie.) Peter and I are the main coders of the server. Chris is the social media admin who makes sure you guys always stay informed and up to date.Clay is the community admin, he deals with players, the forums and other things.  We have no other staff right now but we will be always watching for potential staff.Smash:     Smash was a gamemode made by Minecraft PVP based on the game Super Smash Brothers. The aim was to knock your competitors off the map with a range of buffs and a variety of kits. The more damage you took the farther back you would be backed up. You would keep on getting knocked off the arena but you would need to try and get back onto the map using your double jump rocket which is given to everyone. It was a fast paced, action packed game of you trying to knock other people off the battlefield but keeping yourself alive as well. We used to have tons of fun playing together as a community. We had separate teams and there would be tournaments. All smash players formed a family, the best family. We would spend hours of fun times together. You could become a part of this great community, made by the people who created the original one.Progress:     We are working very hard to get this server up and running as fast as possible. We will be making weekly updates to ensure you guys know whats going on and can keep track. So far we have made a lot of progress with the server and we are almost ready to release a Alpha version that anyone that bought the Alpha/Beta Tester or higher will be able to join and test out. We are also 75% finished with our spawn that our amazing team of builders are finishing up. Here is a photo of the spawn so far.    More information coming in the next update which will be added every Friday from now on.  Also if you'd like you can follow us with our social media sites.Perks & Ranks:      In this section of the post I am going to be describing in detail the ranks and perks you buy.Free Kit:    When  you join the server or a code is sent to you, you will be allowed to pick any kit you like and keep it permanently. While the campaign is going on kits are 20% off then what they will be. Also as the server becomes more popular the prices are subject to change. This is a great perk to buy if you just wanna help out a bit and get something cool for it.Smasher:       The Smasher rank is the cheapest rank you can get on the server. It allows you to join games when they are full,receive a lot in-game features such as more kits and get a lot of cool in-game aesthetics, for example a colored name, to make yourself even cooler.Normally the Smasher rank is 5$ a month but if you buy it now and help fund us you will receive a free kit to keep permanently.Brawler:       The Brawler rank is the mid range priced rank on the server. It allows you to have all the features that a Smasher has but more. You receive in-game aesthetics as well as cool features such as spectating.     Normally the Brawler rank is 10$ a month but if you buy it now and help fund us you will receive a free kit to keep permanently.ChampionThis is the highest rank you can buy on the server, it gives you every in-game perk, feature and benefit we offer. You also get to try new and upcoming features before any other rank can besides staff.Normally the Champion rank is 25$ a month but if you buy it now and help fund us you will receive a 5$ discount and you will receive a free kit to keep permanently.Alpha/Beta Tester:    You become of the few players that can test the server out before its released. This means you get to help us find anything wrong and things to improve. Also because you helped use alpha/beta test you will get a month of Champion where you get everything feature in the server.  Only 30 players can buy this rank.Legendary:    Legendary give you 3 months of the highest rank, Champion, which gives you all perks and features. Also you will be added to the alpha/beta tester list where you can join the server before anyone else can, where you can help us test and make the server better. You will also be able to talk with many of the staff and best smash players around. After that you will also receive all the kits we create and offer for free permanently.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>My name is Chris a solo entrepreneur based in New Orleans. I honestly create a wide range of different things from Jewelry to Video games! Please do not let that give you the false impression that I jump around WITHOUT finishing my projects tho! ;)</p>
<p>My current focus and love is learning to and creating video games but as most indie game developers know. You still have to bills to pay while creating the game haha. Which brings me here. </p>
<p>I would love to be able to just focus on actually creating something 24/7 which I can no do without your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $19,200 and a year of your time!</p>
<p>$19,200 may seem like a strange amount but I'm only asking for enough to cover my essential bills for the year!</p>
<p>Me being able to focus solely on Glass Tower will allow me to give supply you all with a MUCH clean and polished game. Which I believe we all would enjoy!</p>
<p>Allowing me to come up with more personalized and creative gifts for supports! (Perks of being a designer of all types of mediums) </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I understand that this is my first official game and people may think that I'm out of my depth. Promising things I can not deliver.  Which I totally understand. A year is not a long time when it comes to game development. </p>
<p>All I can say to that honestly is to check out my track record and give me a chance! :)</p>
<p>Every past project I've started has been from absolute zero, but I still managed to deliver high quality products. With zero experience. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not afford to contribute but would still like to help. </p>
