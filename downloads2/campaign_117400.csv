<p>Hey there! I'm Julian, a transgender artist from California. I grew up in Orange County, went to school in Oakland, and currently live in Philadelphia, PA. I've been a writer for as long as I can remember. Poetry was my outlet as a kid, fiction helped me through my teen years, and now as a young adult I use experimental memoir to share my experiences as a queer transgender Jew with lots (and lots) of feelings.</p>
<p>I applied for the LLF writers retreat on a whim, never expecting to be accepted. But when the letter came saying I'd not only been accepted to Cris Beam's non-fiction workshop, but that I'd also received a half scholarship of $825, I was blown away. My whim suddenly became a need. I crave the chance to join a community of queer writers. Even more so, I crave the time to seriously work on my writing before starting grad school at San Francisco State University this August.</p>
<h2>Cost Breakdown</h2>
<p>There are a few obstacles between this writers retreat and I. Firstly, tuition. Although I was given an $825 scholarship, this still only covers half the total cost. Secondly, transportation. I'm moving back to Oakland this summer, but to get between Oakland and LA costs about $175 (assuming I can buy these tickets sooner rather than later). So that's an even $1000.</p>
<p>The fundraising could stop there and I'd be the happiest boy imaginable.</p>
<p>But there's this one other problem. My laptop is no longer portable or functional without a large and heavy monitor/keyboard/mouse set-up. It's in truly sad shape, held together by tape and a dream. Really though, it's falling apart. I'm not only a writer and new grad student, but a photographer and an aspiring filmmaker. In order to be able to write at the retreat, to be able to commute between SF and Oakland for grad school, and to continue my art and business as a photographer/filmmaker, I need a functional computer. If we can come up with another $1000, I could buy a really great laptop that would suit all my needs. </p>
<h2>Perks for Donors</h2>
<p>Supporting this project doesn't just benefit me. I've come up with a number of rewards for you lovely donors!</p>
<p><strong>Donate $5-25</strong> and you'll receive a shout-out on facebook, plus a well crafted thank-you email about how wise, generous, and attractive you are.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $26-75</strong> (and give me your address) and I'll send you a HAND WRITTEN letter thanking you for being wise/generous/attractive <strong>AND</strong> a limerick about your glory and benevolence <strong>AND</strong> a hand-printed patch that I made. They're really, really cute. Pics to come.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $76-200</strong> and you'll get all of the above PLUS a free photoshoot of any kind from the kind folks (me) at <a href=""http://queerlens.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Queer Lens Photography</a> to be redeemed any time you like. If you were already looking to get headshots done by me, this is a great way to do it and to support my epic quest simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Donate $201+</strong> and I will do all of the above and clean your entire house while dancing to music of your choice, no joke. Klezmer, 90's R&amp;B, dubstep, anything. I'm fairly neurotic and am really good at cleaning. Lucky you. You will also receive MY UNDYING GRATITUDE BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND YOU'RE SO AMAZING AND PERFECT.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, wow. Last month we decided to kick on a little bit as an experiment and put more of our time into Wings Over Scotland, and <a href=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/biff-bang-pow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the results were dramatic</a>. But the truth of the matter is that we can't keep up that level every month, because we have to earn a living.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">(Some lovely readers made generous donations over the Christmas/New Year period in particular, which were very much appreciated but not enough to cover the rent on our humble shack for a month, let alone our crippling heroin habit.)</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But here's a thing: supporters of independence constantly and loudly bemoan the lack of a pro-independence Scottish newspaper, or even just a balanced one committed to old-fashioned fair-minded and honest reporting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The last attempt to make a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Standard"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">print one</a> crashed and burned <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4483449.stm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a long time ago</a> - as pointedly noted in the image above by Kerry Gill, current political editor of the Scottish Daily Express.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wings Over Scotland is pretty small beer in the grand scheme of things. But nevertheless, from a standing start and with very little help from anyone other than its own readers and contributors, this wee site, mostly the part-time work of one person, has built a readership of over 30,000 people. And that’s actually quite a big deal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We currently have a <a href=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/donate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""subscription""</a> facility where readers can donate £2 a month to help with our running costs. If, purely hypothetically speaking, everyone who reads the site subscribed - at just 46p a week, or 1p more than a <em>single day's</em> edition of the Daily Record - we'd suddenly and startlingly have enough money in the kitty to pay for <strong>TWENTY full-time professional journalists</strong> on very decent wages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><em>(Because 30,000 times £2 is £60,000 a month, divided by 20 people is £3000 a month each, or £36,000 a year - a pretty handsome salary for a journalist, or indeed anyone else, these days. Obviously the arithmetic wouldn't be quite that simplistic in real life, but as a basic illustration of the power even a modest readership could harness if it put its mind to it, it's a real eye-opener.)</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now, don't panic. We're not nearly mad enough to think we'd get 30,000 readers to all cough up even that modest sum for the sake of a dedicated, professionally-produced Scottish news site with 20 full-time staff. So after a <a href=""https://twitter.com/NewScotGirl/status/291537219557134336"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reader's suggestion</a> a couple of weeks ago, instead of 20 writers we're going to see if we can start with just one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/newscotgirl.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-28474 lazy"" data-src=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/newscotgirl-460x253.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""We couldn't actually use Kickstarter, as under their rules it would count as a &quot;cause&quot; and be ineligible. But that's okay with the coincidentally- but aptly-named Indiegogo.""/></a></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I first became a professional journalist in January 1991, taking a Staff Writer job on a new videogames magazine. I stayed with the magazine for three years, becoming Deputy Editor and then Acting Editor, and seeing it rise from third place to become the best-seller in its field, with a peak circulation of around 65,000 copies a month. Along with some games- and software-development work I've been a freelance for the 17 years since, working chiefly as a writer for dozens of publications from the Guardian to Esquire, The Face, SFX, Front, Teletext and Wired, on subjects ranging from games to music, TV, films, football, comedy and travel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The referendum on independence is the most important subject I'll ever be involved in, and I don't want to be doing it as a hobby (and especially to the point where I can't afford to pay my rent from neglecting proper work). So the purpose of this Indiegogo project is to see if enough people are prepared to put their money where their mouth is and hire at least one full-time professional journalist to cover the topic every day without having to <a href=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/smile-for-me-now-brother/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">follow the agenda</a> of uniformly-Unionist newspaper proprietors.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That modest goal requires a <strong>very</strong> small commitment from readers: a <strong>one-off</strong> contribution of just <strong>£1</strong> <strong>each</strong>. If everyone who reads Wings Over Scotland this month contributes that tiny sum I can do this as a job for a whole year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There'll be more posts every day, and the opportunity to do more in-depth research. The site can have a design overhaul to make it even more accessible and make the additional content easier to navigate. If we exceed the minimum, we can pay other people for still more articles and features, and perhaps ultimately grow a whole online newspaper organically from the ground up. (I like the name <em>""Scotland Tomorrow""</em>.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It's up to you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS<br/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Why do you need thousands of pounds to keep doing what you've been doing for free for the past year and a bit?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Because I can't sustain the current level of commitment to Wings Over Scotland and keep a roof over my head. I need to spend more time on earning money and less on writing about Scottish politics for nothing. The ideal scenario, obviously, would be earning a living writing about Scottish politics, but I'm going to hazard a guess that the Herald and Scotsman won't be knocking on the door any time soon, so we're going to have to do this for ourselves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Why should we pay you when there are loads of free blogs, and lots of other sites who also want money?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">That's entirely your decision. Look back at the quantity and quality of content we've published here over the last 15 months and decide whether it's matched anywhere else. And if you do like it, ponder whether an expanded, improved version of it would be worth a little under 2p a week to you or not.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Why don't you just have advertising?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Respectable as our readership is, it's not yet large enough to attract serious interest/revenue from advertisers. More importantly, we're journalists, not ad-sales people - frankly we have no idea how to go about it. One thing we could look at if we exceeded the minimum goal would be hiring someone to sort that out for us, so that we wouldn't have to ask readers for money again next year. But in a perfect world we could fund the site without being beholden to advertisers at all.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Do you really need THAT much money?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">We chose the figure to represent a symbolic £1 per reader. (To be honest, we sort of wish we'd had slightly fewer readers last month.) But yes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">The ""living wage"" in the UK is £15,496 nationwide, or £17,784 in London. Wings Over Scotland is based in one of the <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/houseprices/9607526/The-10-most-expensive-and-least-expensive-cities-in-Britain.html?frame=2368392"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">most expensive</a> cities in Britain, and the living wage is itself a pretty bare minimum of tolerable existence (plus Indiegogo take a chunk out of the total as commission).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">The target sum will keep us alive, cover running costs - including an overdue proper transfer to <a href=""http://wingsoverscotland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wingsoverscotland.com</a>, which should stop some people's workplaces blocking us for having the word ""game"" in our URL - and <strong>pay other people for articles </strong>and so on too. If we're not working for free, we're not going to ask others to.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>So why not just ask for donations as normal?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Because just asking people to bung you money <em>ad hoc</em> is a bit beggy, and more to the point it doesn't bring in much. Every penny in donations is appreciated very much indeed, but since we've had the Donate page the total is well short of four figures, in nine months. This way, your money goes towards a very specific, clear and defined goal - paying properly for the site to be a full-time professional concern. This way it's crowdsourced project funding, not panhandling.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Couldn't you try a paywall?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">A paywall would rather defeat the object of the site, which is to reach as many people as possible and give them the facts about the independence debate. <em>""Hey there, No voter - go and read this site to see why the stuff you're saying is wrong! Oh, you'll have to pay for it, by the way""</em> isn't going to change many minds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Shouldn't I give my cash to the official Yes campaign instead?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">We're hoping that a <a href=""http://wingsland.podgamer.com/pretending-to-see-the-future/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">single £1</a> won't put too much of a dent in your philanthropy budget.</p>
<p><strong>What will we get for our money?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">For your £1 you'll be getting a year (or more) of seven-day reporting, at considerably more than 40 hours a week. You'll get more posts every day, even compared to January's record total. We'll be able to devote more time to writing, researching, audio-capturing and transcribing, because we won't have to be fretting that every hour we spend working for the site is an hour we're not earning money to pay the bills with.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Anything over and above the target will be put straight into the site in the form of paid content from other high-quality contributors, as well as other improvements - better webhosting, broader coverage (<em>eg</em> we could afford a subscription to The Times to monitor its Scottish reporting), attending events in person and so on. Ideally we'd make enough to carry on all the way to the referendum, but we're keeping the goal simple for now.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Crucially, more money would also enable us to do something several readers have asked for - produce <a href=""http://www.newspaperclub.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">printed materials</a> that could be used by doorstep campaigners to get vital facts and information across to people who don't frequent political websites.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you don't reach the target?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">We don't have the faintest idea whether the fundraiser will succeed or not. If we don't reach the target amount, we'll put any money we do get into the site one way or another - a couple of months full-time, a couple of paid contributors, a new candle for our desk and an extra pair of gloves to keep our typing fingers warm, whatever.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;""><em>(If we don't reach the target, incidentally, we get substantially less money than the ""final total"" - Indiegogo charge <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/how-pricing-works-on-indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more than twice as much</a> commission if you miss your goal as they do if you hit it, to encourage achievable aims.)</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">It might be that Kerry Gill is right, and that independence supporters will do anything for a fair and balanced quality press except pay 2p a week for it.

<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Or perhaps it'll exceed our wildest dreams and we'll be able to offer you a daily diet of stories, features and columns about Scottish politics from the finest writers in the country, from all points of view, with unparallelled quality of research and insight.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Can I donate more than £1 if I want to?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"">Oh God yes, by all means. Obviously in the real world not everyone will kick in, so we'll need some people to do more than their bit if we're going to have a chance.

<p>The Religion-Free Bible Project exists to inspire more love, peace, beauty, goodness, acceptance, compassion, justice and harmony in the world by offering humankind a paraphrase of biblical passages, which combine texts and images to creatively capture the spirit and meaning of the Bible, free from the bias and baggage of man-made religion.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT WILL BE THE IMPACT OF THE RFB PROJECT?</strong></p>
<p>Many people are on the journey of shedding religion to know God, and no longer support the view of Jesus or the Bible that is being taught by the institutional church. Different denominations have views that often lead to condemning people of other faiths, forcing Christians to adopt beliefs and practices they often cannot live up to or support in good conscience, and requiring people to promote a message that divides human beings in the name of God. These same people embrace a religion-free Jesus who stood for the inherent, equal, and divine worth of every human being. Seeking to be instruments of love, peace, grace, compassion and justice, these “divine nobodies” courageously work towards a world that works for everyone.</p>
<p>The greatest need of all people has always been and continues to be to know there is nothing wrong with us, that we are loved and accepted by God without condition. This was the meaning of Jesus’ life. This is the highest truth that defies, fulfills and transcends all religion, and this is the truth that sets people free. And yet countless people have shared with Jim the disillusionment and damage that resulted from their experience in organized religion.</p>

wild and wooly road of cancer — to help them know that they are not alone.  </p>
<p><b>About Breast Dancer</b></p>
<p>I wrote <i>Breast
Dancer </i>just after I completed treatments for breast cancer.  Even though I lived in Alaska, I had a
great support group of friends — distance runners and survivors— who walked the
road with me. </p>
<p>Here is an excerpt from the book . . . </p>
<p><em><b>Breast Journey </b><b>Step 16 – North to the Yukon</b></em></p>
<p><em> . . .</em><span><em> Some of the heartiest laughs I’ve ever produced, deep and loud and unselfconscious, were with Team Survivor Perseverance, on the Klondike International Road Relay.</em></span></p>
<p><em>Despite our ironclad motto — “What happens on the Klondike stays on the Klondike” — I must share some of the unforgettable moments I’ve spent dancing with these gals on a grassy dance floor under a humid tent in Whitehorse, Yukon. Together we listened with glee to one laid back Canadian band after another, celebrating Life in a way that only Survivors can, having kicked death’s ass and happy to tell the tale. These women distinguished the important (friendship, kindness, passion) from the<br/>unimportant (perfection, guilt and housecleaning). These were Survivors who had<br/>been up all night, running for miles through the mountain passes, and who were<br/>now full of both endorphins and watery beer.</em></p>
<p><span><em>  Especially memorable was the year before I myself had been diagnosed. Appointed fashion consultant for the team, I’d arranged pink boas for each member to wear to the dance and award ceremony. As we danced and the tent became increasingly,<br/>humanly humid, the pink feathers began sticking to all our glistening faces and<br/>arms. For some of these friends, having recently endured the indignities of<br/>surgery and hair loss, these feathery adornments recaptured the first touch of<br/>their lost femininity.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Jan hatched the lovely idea to pass on the boas to anyone with a new diagnosis, and<br/>so the feathers have made their way around the state and the country, with our<br/>sweat and our music still clinging to them, to bring joy and hope to other<br/>women.</em></span></p>
<p><em>Running — and the bold, fearless women who do it — saw me strongly through this odyssey and prepared me for those to come. As with singing, the sheer joy of surrendering myself to the Road, and the satisfaction of giving my all as part of a team, contains some of the deepest spiritual lessons of my life. During radiation fatigue, my motivation to get out the door and run came from my commitment to this team.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Why We Need Your Support</b></p>
<p>It has taken seven years, and many edits,
and now we are finally ready to go to print. I keep thinking that perhaps they
will find a cure, and that breast cancer will become a thing of the past, but
so far, that has not happened. Just last month, I met a woman at a resort on
the San Juan Islands who had just finished her treatments, and we shared our
stories, and laughed, and cried just a bit. She is waiting for this book to be
published. But first, we need your help.</p>
<p>We have included the lyrics to several songs
in <i>Breast Dancer. </i>Some music
publishers have generously donated the rights to use their lyrics, but for 12 songs,
the publishing companies require that we pay a fee. We also have some stock
imagery costs related to the cover, and getting the word out about the book.
I’d like to record it too, for those people in chemotherapy for whom reading is
not so easy, but who might like to listen to my melodious voice. If you
contribute to this campaign, then the women who are waiting — for a laugh, for
a story, for a dance — can get a copy of this book to set on their bedside
table, for those nights when they can’t sleep, and just need to make
connection.</p>
<p>Whether or not you can donate, please
consider sending this information along to friends and family.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help, and may your life
be blessed with health and dancing!</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goals</b></p>
<p>All of the editing and book layout work for
<i>Breast Dancer</i> has been done pro bono. We’ve set a conservative goal for this
campaign, to cover the music rights and the costs associated with self-publishing
in e-book and printed formats. </p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to exceed our
goal of $2,500, the additional funding will go toward purchasing books for
women who can’t afford them. We’ve got some festive perks to thank our donors,
and most importantly, you will get that good feeling that you are helping
someone through a difficult time. Survivors come in all ages, sizes, and
demographics. Who knows — someday, that person just may be you.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal, we will purchase as many reprint permissions as possible, and publish <i>Breast Dancer</i> in a slightly abridged form.  We think all the lyrics are important to the story, but we'll make some hard choices in order to get this book out and into the hands of people who need it. </p>

<h3>I'm an anarchist, a writer, a believer in people</h3>
<p>I'm not very adept at writing about myself. It feels heavily egotistical. My sense is that my work speaks more of who I am than any trumped up autobio. At present, I have one novel on the market. In short, my writing centers around the inherent beauty of struggle. Struggle's importance is often overlooked in a world filled with trivial and corrupted pursuits such as politics, law, and religion. Everyday, in so many mediums, we hear people lament the holes in their lives, the emptiness of their existence when the only true and constant thread is individual struggle. When one accepts the exquisite simplicity of it, the world becomes a different place. One realizes that winning means nothing and losing means even less. There are no winners or losers, only volunteers. </p>
<p>Many of my shorter works are posted here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://skitzofuel.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Philosophy of Struggle</a> </p>
<p>I am poised to write my next novel, an ambitious attempt to deliver a wider audience the full weight of my philosophy. It will be a road story, a story of discovery and revelation. I need help to make it real. So I've decided to request the assistance of people who still care about the art of storytelling and the power of words.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Choked with non-fiction and history, contemporary anarchist
literature needs an injection of creative fiction and revelatory stories.
Anarchist fiction has a long and illustrious history. Help me bring the drama,
humor,and vitality back to a genre that hasn’t seen a Camus or Edward Abbey in
quite some time.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Marketing and time are expensive</h3>
<p>After self-publishing my novel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Night-Filled-Mountain-Skitz-OFuel/dp/1469960028/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1379442287&amp;sr=1-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">That Night Filled Mountain</a>, I realized the impact marketing has when scouting the correct audience for a book.

<h3><br/></h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","I'm an anarchist, a writer, a believer in people
I'm not very adept at writing about myself. It feels heavily egotistical. My sense is that my work speaks more of who I am than any trumped up autobio. At present, I have one novel on the market. In short, my writing centers around the inherent beauty of struggle. Struggle's importance is often overlooked in a world filled with trivial and corrupted pursuits such as politics, law, and religion. Everyday, in so many mediums, we hear people lament the holes in their lives, the emptiness of their existence when the only true and constant thread is individual struggle. When one accepts the exquisite simplicity of it, the world becomes a different place. One realizes that winning means nothing and losing means even less. There are no winners or losers, only volunteers. 
Many of my shorter works are posted here:
The Philosophy of Struggle 
I am poised to write my next novel, an ambitious attempt to deliver a wider audience the full weight of my philosophy. It will be a road story, a story of discovery and revelation. I need help to make it real. So I've decided to request the assistance of people who still care about the art of storytelling and the power of words.
Choked with non-fiction and history, contemporary anarchist
literature needs an injection of creative fiction and revelatory stories.
Anarchist fiction has a long and illustrious history. Help me bring the drama,
humor,and vitality back to a genre that hasn’t seen a Camus or Edward Abbey in
quite some time.


Marketing and time are expensive
After self-publishing my novel That Night Filled Mountain, I realized the impact marketing has when scouting the correct audience for a book. I feel the need to explore this avenue to the fullest and, unfortunately, this requires money. More money than a starving writing can afford.      

If this campaign is successful, each contributor will receive not only a signed copy of the funded book but also a signed copy of an art book project also in the works. Anyone who contributes $200 or more will be listed in a specific acknowledgments section of the book. 
If the $5000 goal isn't met, I will provide each contributor with a digital copy of my previous book That Night Filled Mountain.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Many of us-including those who seem to have it all together-are holding on to
some pain in our lives that has the potential to destroy us, and it is costing
us our happiness and our relationships.  Discovering
who you are is the single most important thing you will ever do in your life
because all of our thoughts and actions are based on who we think we are-but
the truth is that many of us are not honest with ourselves and make choices
based on fiction-not fact, which wreaks havoc in our lives and relationships.
My book, Naked &amp; Transparent, will help people identify their true selves
so that they can rise above the pain that once held them in mental and
emotional captivity. </p><p></p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/567473/files/20140508212809-reflection1.png?1399609689"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></b></p><p></p><p></p>

The Passionate Story for Nature’s Glory
Hello,
Amazing People!
My
name is Alexander
and I come from a small but very beautiful country of Moldova. I am an alumnus of AIESEC, member of JCI
and Let’s Do It!, fellow of Kairos Society and an Ashoka Changemaker.
It happened so that I am a multifaceted person: engaged in environmental
research, social entrepreneurship, education and training, writing prose and
poetry, etc. However, all my energy is focused on one PASSION – the NATURE.

""Care about the Earth as the only home and true
friend you have.
Because
it really is so.""
Since
early childhood I admire the beauty and wisdom of the Nature. Also I care much
about its protection from a large number of environmentally destructive human
activities and therefore engage in environmental initiatives and promote the
need to protect the environment. This has become my mission in life.
In
order to share the Nature’s awesomeness and the importance of conserving it with
other people, I started writing poems on this topic. You can read them in my
first book “The
Thoughts” and my blog with the same name: http://ischenco-thoughts.blogspot.com.
I have also made some public readings of my creations at a number of events,
such as the Free Tribe in Chisinau, Moldova.
The
poems were then supplied by 2 short stories: “Black Hole”
and “Road
to Happiness”. And now I have come to the point to start releasing my first
large trilogy of novels under the title “THE
MONSTER”.

will also be my first “experiment” of publishing and demonstrating the
awesomeness of a crowdsourced literature creation – THE NOVEL FOR THE PEOPLE BY

<h3>Who Am I and What's the Plan?</h3>
<br/>My name is Edward Renehan. I'm the author of numerous histories and biographies which have won critical praise in the <i>New York Times</i> and other publications, and which have sold well both domestically and internationally. My books include <i>The Secret Six</i> (Crown/Random House), <i>The Lion's Pride</i> (Oxford University Press), <i>The Kennedys at War</i> (Doubleday) and <i>Dark Genius of Wall Street</i> (Basic/Perseus). I have also contributed many reviews and essays to such publications as<i> The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and Hearst's <i>Veranda, </i>and appeared<i> </i>frequently on C-SPAN's BookTV. As well, I'm in the 35th year of a career on the editorial side of publishing, having held major positions at Macmillan, St. Martin's Press and other houses. I am currently the proprietor of my own small, human-sized firm (New Street Communications, founded 2010) doing digital, paper and audio publishing out of a home office near Newport, RI. I love the democratizing impact which the new digital tools have had on publishing, and am delighted to be a participant in helping build/shape a paradigm in which all writers have an equal opportunity to succeed.<br/><br/>My other love is folk music. I am an adequate guitar-picker (to the extent that I recorded with Pete Seeger for Folkways in the 1970s, and have performed on stage with the likes of Happy and Artie Traum). My latest published book is <b><i>Pete Seeger vs. The Un-Americans - A Tale of the Blacklist</i></b>. This book was successfully crowd-funded via Kickstarter, and has been praised by the likes of actor/director <b>Steve Buscemi</b> (Boardwalk Empire's<i> Nucky Thompson</i>), who called it ""Excellent, a truly enjoyable and informative read.""<br/><br/>I am currently on the back-end of researching and writing <b>the first book ever to focus on one of the most important events in American musical culture: Bob Dylan's controversial and dramatic transition from acoustic to electric music with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 (half a century ago this July).</b> The book is based on new interviews with key participants, as well as unpublished memoirs and other unique, previously-untapped sources. The book also includes numerous never-before-seen photographs. Most importantly, the book dispels the many myths and urban legends which surround the event (many of them perpetuated in the most popular Dylan biographies published in recent years). My aim has been to cut to the <i>facts</i> as they happened on the ground, while also providing context for what Dylan's shift meant as a key moment in the history of the sixties.<br/><br/>The book will be published in three editions: eBook, paper, and audio.<br/><br/>At this stage in the process - with photo licensing fees pending, paper book production pending,  and [very expensive] production to begin shortly on the audio edition - I could use some cash-flow to follow-through on the project. I am therefore seeking to crowd-fund these last stages of the book with what amounts to discounted pre-sale of the various editions, along with perks.<br/><br/>I hope you'll consider joining me in what I consider to be an exciting and important venture.<br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p> <ul> <li>At this stage in the process, I'd ideally like to get $5,000 (or more) to help complete all phases of the project. </li> <li>I've set up a menu of perks which in essence represent discounts against what will be the retail pricing of the book in its various editions after publication, and also include such additional goodies as the placing of your name in the acknowledgments and a full size poster of the cover art.<br/>
</li> <li>As mentioned above, the funds will go for the most part toward final production and prep of the various editions, as well as photo-licensing. <br/>

My name is Edward Renehan. I'm the author of numerous histories and biographies which have won critical praise in the New York Times and other publications, and which have sold well both domestically and internationally. My books include The Secret Six (Crown/Random House), The Lion's Pride (Oxford University Press), The Kennedys at War (Doubleday) and Dark Genius of Wall Street (Basic/Perseus). I have also contributed many reviews and essays to such publications as The Wall Street Journal, San Francisco Chronicle, and Hearst's Veranda, and appeared frequently on C-SPAN's BookTV. As well, I'm in the 35th year of a career on the editorial side of publishing, having held major positions at Macmillan, St. Martin's Press and other houses. I am currently the proprietor of my own small, human-sized firm (New Street Communications, founded 2010) doing digital, paper and audio publishing out of a home office near Newport, RI. I love the democratizing impact which the new digital tools have had on publishing, and am delighted to be a participant in helping build/shape a paradigm in which all writers have an equal opportunity to succeed.My other love is folk music. I am an adequate guitar-picker (to the extent that I recorded with Pete Seeger for Folkways in the 1970s, and have performed on stage with the likes of Happy and Artie Traum). My latest published book is Pete Seeger vs. The Un-Americans - A Tale of the Blacklist. This book was successfully crowd-funded via Kickstarter, and has been praised by the likes of actor/director Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire's Nucky Thompson), who called it ""Excellent, a truly enjoyable and informative read.""I am currently on the back-end of researching and writing the first book ever to focus on one of the most important events in American musical culture: Bob Dylan's controversial and dramatic transition from acoustic to electric music with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 (half a century ago this July). The book is based on new interviews with key participants, as well as unpublished memoirs and other unique, previously-untapped sources. The book also includes numerous never-before-seen photographs. Most importantly, the book dispels the many myths and urban legends which surround the event (many of them perpetuated in the most popular Dylan biographies published in recent years). My aim has been to cut to the facts as they happened on the ground, while also providing context for what Dylan's shift meant as a key moment in the history of the sixties.The book will be published in three editions: eBook, paper, and audio.At this stage in the process - with photo licensing fees pending, paper book production pending,  and [very expensive] production to begin shortly on the audio edition - I could use some cash-flow to follow-through on the project. I am therefore seeking to crowd-fund these last stages of the book with what amounts to discounted pre-sale of the various editions, along with perks.I hope you'll consider joining me in what I consider to be an exciting and important venture.
  What I Need & What You Get
  At this stage in the process, I'd ideally like to get $5,000 (or more) to help complete all phases of the project.  I've set up a menu of perks which in essence represent discounts against what will be the retail pricing of the book in its various editions after publication, and also include such additional goodies as the placing of your name in the acknowledgments and a full size poster of the cover art.
 As mentioned above, the funds will go for the most part toward final production and prep of the various editions, as well as photo-licensing. 
    

Impact 
DYLAN AT NEWPORT, 1965 will, I feel, be a very important addition to the canon of literature depicting the era of the sixties and the canon of literature about one of the greatest songwriters of our time.

Cullin celebrated Haw as “a sort of Brave New World for modern times, updated with Jackson’s expansive, unique vision of a world bordering on collapse, but not yet devoid of hope. The unique imagery and characters summoned in Haw is equal parts moving, funny, irreverent, timely, and verging on sheer brilliance. I relished every moment of it.”<br/></p>
<p>Sean is a multiple NC Press Association award winner who worked as a journalist in Eastern NC for over a decade. His years covering government and communities in NC has given him an inside perspective on the effects of corruption, neglect, poverty and class divisions that impact our state and country. He's had numerous short stories published in literary journals, from the U.S. to Canada and Australia and was a 2011 Million Writers Award nominee for his short story <a href=""http://forgejournal.com/forge/2010/07/01/not-even-jail/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://forgejournal.com/forge/2010/07/01/not-even-jail/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Not Even Jail""</a> by Forge journal. </p>
<p>Mired in a corrupt, dangerous city that is on the verge of collapse, a father and son flee to a rural village, hoping to find refuge from their violent lives. What they find is not the haunted hippie environs of local legend, but a gritty farm community that thrives despite the threat of criminal invasions and the ominous presence of a nearby nuclear reactor. A bioengineer, Lucas lends his expertise to the efforts of sustainability, while his son—a rising young photojournalist—falls in love with one of the sons of a folksy family whose charm lies in its ability to keep the community together, through music and love—until disaster shakes their fragile world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Here's how we expand Haw's reach</b></p>
<p>Haw is being published and released June 19 by Harvard Square Editions, a small press based in Hollywood, California. Being a small press, their marketing budget is limited. A plus to a small press is their dedication to innovative, new voices in the publishing world and Harvard Square in particular focuses on environmental and climate change fiction which plays a large part in Haw's story.</p>
<p>Local, regional and East Coast events are in the planning stages. The launch party is set for July 18 in Carrboro, NC. An author event is scheduled in Elizabeth City, NC for August and guest author appearances in Louisville, Kentucky and Orlando, Florida for September. Attending events, signings, conventions, readings, etc. adds up. Getting the word out about Haw and it's powerful cautionary messages about climate change, government corruption, acceptance of LGBT people and class division based on poverty and race, are important to Sean, especially with the turn NC's state government has taken since 2012. Haw explores what could happen if climate change is left unchecked and the government stops caring about its most vulnerable citizens.</p>

(such as bookmarks, stickers, magnets), raffle giveaways of said swag, 
other cool marketing ideas I have yet to dream up, and possibly one meal
 to sustain me during the marathon that is a new book launch.  
(Nachos...Just one plate.  A girl deserves a plate of nachos for her 
hard work.)You might be thinking, Gee...These ""swag"" things sound pretty cool.  How do I get my hands on some of those?  The answer: Sign on to help fund this project!  Here are some of the perks I'll be offering...

Aqua bookmarks, featuring cool graphics, a witty quote (the level of wit may be subject to interpretation), and an autograph.

Autographed Aqua stickers, which can be placed inside the book cover, on a folder or binder, on your furniture (provided it's inexpensive and/or you're a master of refinishing furniture), or on your person (not recommended anywhere that involves hair).

Aqua magnets (I'm going to assume that you guys know the concept...Find something metal to stick it to.)
E-book copies of Aqua.  Ah, now we're getting to the point of all this.  The BOOK!  I will gladly ""Authorgraph"" it for you (an electronic autograph e-mailed right to you, which you request through the Authorgraph.com website).
Paperback copies of Aqua.  (Is the name ""Aqua"" ingrained on your brain yet?)  These are autographed, of course.  I will offer a paperback copy as one of the higher-dollar perks, as I have learned from experience that shipping paperbacks gets pricey (They have to ship to me for signature, then again to you.  Hence the need for a funding campaign.  And my apologies for the requirement to add additional charges for international shipping.  If I had the funds, I wouldn't be begging for your help in this very moment.)
E-book copies of my previous trilogy, The Proximity Series.  Haven't read it?  You should check it out.  Or, contribute to this campaign, and I'll give it to you!  Awesome, right?
An honorable mention on my author website, www.booksbygeorge.net, if you like that sort of notoriety.  I may also tweet your praises with reckless abandon (I promise I won't be obnoxious about it.)  This one's completely optional, if you don't care to have your name mentioned with my gushing effusions of gratitude.

The ImpactWriting books is my passion.  I would write books from now until the end of time, whether I have the funds to market them or not.  But let's face it, actually selling copies of books is way cooler than watching them languish on the shelves.  I wish these puppies sold themselves, but I live in the real world (most of the time).  I've learned from marketing my Proximity series that the little expenses here and there add up to a chunk of change I don't just happen to have lying around.  If you do have a giant wad of money lying around, feel free to share your secrets on how you acquired it.  (Or you can lop off a little chunk and share, I won't mind). I just want to send this story out into the world, and have the capacity to put it in front of more readers who can absorb themselves in the world of Aqua the way I have.  That's all I'm asking.Other Ways You Can HelpI completely get it if you don't have the funds to offer.  Since this is all about helping me market my book, your help in spreading the word would be a huge contribution in itself.  Tweet, post to Facebook, talk about it on your blog or to your friends, download a very reasonably-priced e-book copy of Aqua when it releases, and even better...Write a review about it!  (Preferably one that doesn't eviscerate it for sucking beyond belief.  How could it possibly suck?  It's awesome.  I have zero bias whatsoever, by the way.)  You can also sign up to join my ""street team"", dedicated to helping me spread the word about my books.  Just visit my website: www.booksbygeorge.net, and look for the giant glaring red button.  You can't miss it.  If you want to help, but you're not sure how, send me a message on the Contact page of my website.  I'll respond to your e-mail ASAP.  If you just want to say ""Hi"", use the message form for that too.  I love to be greeted just for fun's sake, it's awesome.  You'll find that I'm a real, live person.  I don't bite (unless I'm famished from hours of writing, and you look like a plate of nachos).  If you made it this far, THANK YOU.  If you make it to the point of signing on to contribute, HUGE THANKS.  Anything you can do to help me spread the word is truly appreciated.  And as a parting treat, here is the ""blurb"" about Aqua:Meet Layla McKelland:

<p>Mousieur Auguste Rodent, The Artist of Abundant Talent, is the creation of highly regarded painter Niina Chebry. Niina created over 40 original canvases to illustrate the wonderful story she wrote. Her story was patiently crafted in rhymes and always puts a smile on the face of readers, young and old.</p>
<p><br/>Auguste Rodent (modeled after Auguste Rodin the famous French sculptor) is a talented sculptor who uses imported cheese as a medium, in a country very proud of its 400 fromages. Monsieur Brie, an opportunistic art critic, causes a patriotic scandal when he denounces Auguste’s un-French medium. Fortunately, Auguste’s reputation is saved by a young writer named Bernice Elaine Louise Lorraine Eiffel. The two meet, et voilà, you have a charming storybook ending.</p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://augusterodent.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/AR-Logo1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The story is one of hope, tenacity and love. It runs on multiple levels appealing to both children and adults. The illustrations introduce a soft style and a touch of the ""Belle Époque"" (sense of time and place) that provides opportunities for great interactive features, and plays beautifully on a tablet's HD backlit screen.</p>
<p><br/>Thanks to the dedication of award winning designers focused on the needs of parents and children, Auguste Rodent achieves twin objectives of entertaining children while educating them on major works of art. Innovative features allow the story to be read as a traditional book with realistic page turning.</p>
<p><br/>Or, as another option, Auguste RoDent becomes an interactive experience when the story is narrated by the author Niina Chebry. As Niina reads, literacy learning happens as the words of the story are highlighted. (There is a significant sub-market for the book with adult literacy and English as a second language.)</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Auguste RoDent: The Artist of Abundant Talent is the first tablet interactive book created by Sharing-Books.com. <a href=""http://www.sharing-books.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Sharing Books"">Sharing-Books.com</a> is a web property of Shared Books Limited, a private company registered in British Columbia, Canada. Over 20 private and corporate shareholders pooled their resources to create an online children books publisher with a social mission.</p>

Andrea Azevedo had written a children's book, The Little Suitcase, to honour the short life of  young boy who died of a rare disease at age 10.

</div><blockquote class=""webkit-indent-blockquote"" style=""margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 40px; padding: 0px;""></blockquote>Intrigued, the founders researched the children's book publishing industry and found it begging for a transformation towards e-books, and in need of a more collaborative and social business model. Thus the model of Sharing-Books was created with the sharing of revenue equally between the authors, the company and a charity dedicated to literacy: <a href=""http://www.roomtoread.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Room to Read"">Room to Read</a>.<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The model is to acquire new books by giving authors a platform for quick publishing of their works. The authors get the visibility to launch or enhance their writing career. The children visiting the site get DRM free PDFs of the books. And Sharing-Books get the rights to add value to the books and sell them. This is the process with Auguste Rodent. A great story was published and Sharing-Books is now developing the book <br/>and taking it to a new level as a tablet interactive book.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p></p>
<p style=""margin: 0px; text-align: justify; font: 11px Helvetica;""></p>
<p>Interactive Tablet Books are a new medium.  We aim to discover new possibilities in edutainment for children by inventing unique new features that push the limits of tablets.  This book addresses the needs of tech savvy parents who want to make sure their children develop an interest in Art.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to the usual “read it yourself” and “read it to me” option that highlights words as they are read this book will include factoids that teach children about the masterpieces represented in the book.  Children will complete games or activities that teach them about Art History.  Upon completion of the activities, children acquire a reward in the form of a digital object representing the specific art piece.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These objects are added to an art gallery that can be viewed by the child and compared online with other young collectors.  The online network will offer more games and factoids that will be available to add to the child’s art gallery.  These games have a scarcity engine built in with different levels of difficulty.  Just like hockey cards, baseball cards or more recently Pokémon™ cards, these will be tradable between participants.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have already made a sizeable personal commitment with three years of work on Sharing Books to acquire and publish original books like Auguste Rodent.  Our development budget is $148,000.  This project has received a contribution of $50,000 from British Columbia Film and the Arts Council of British Columbia.  The shareholders of Shared Books Limited have contributed $68,000 to the intellectual property portion of the project.  We need $30,000 to complete the more advanced features of the book that will make this a truly exceptional Art History and Literacy experience for children.<br/></p>

Auguste Rodent (modeled after Auguste Rodin the famous French sculptor) is a talented sculptor who uses imported cheese as a medium, in a country very proud of its 400 fromages. Monsieur Brie, an opportunistic art critic, causes a patriotic scandal when he denounces Auguste’s un-French medium. Fortunately, Auguste’s reputation is saved by a young writer named Bernice Elaine Louise Lorraine Eiffel. The two meet, et voilà, you have a charming storybook ending.


The story is one of hope, tenacity and love. It runs on multiple levels appealing to both children and adults. The illustrations introduce a soft style and a touch of the ""Belle Époque"" (sense of time and place) that provides opportunities for great interactive features, and plays beautifully on a tablet's HD backlit screen.
Thanks to the dedication of award winning designers focused on the needs of parents and children, Auguste Rodent achieves twin objectives of entertaining children while educating them on major works of art. Innovative features allow the story to be read as a traditional book with realistic page turning.
Or, as another option, Auguste RoDent becomes an interactive experience when the story is narrated by the author Niina Chebry. As Niina reads, literacy learning happens as the words of the story are highlighted. (There is a significant sub-market for the book with adult literacy and English as a second language.)


The Impact
Auguste RoDent: The Artist of Abundant Talent is the first tablet interactive book created by Sharing-Books.com. Sharing-Books.com is a web property of Shared Books Limited, a private company registered in British Columbia, Canada. Over 20 private and corporate shareholders pooled their resources to create an online children books publisher with a social mission.

Sharing-Books.com was created when a friend of the founders asked for help. Andrea Azevedo had written a children's book, The Little Suitcase, to honour the short life of  young boy who died of a rare disease at age 10. Andrea was not interested in profiting from her book; she wanted all of the proceeds to go to charity.










Intrigued, the founders researched the children's book publishing industry and found it begging for a transformation towards e-books, and in need of a more collaborative and social business model. Thus the model of Sharing-Books was created with the sharing of revenue equally between the authors, the company and a charity dedicated to literacy: Room to Read.

The model is to acquire new books by giving authors a platform for quick publishing of their works. The authors get the visibility to launch or enhance their writing career. The children visiting the site get DRM free PDFs of the books. And Sharing-Books get the rights to add value to the books and sell them. This is the process with Auguste Rodent. A great story was published and Sharing-Books is now developing the book and taking it to a new level as a tablet interactive book.


What We Need & What You Get



Interactive Tablet Books are a new medium.  We aim to discover new possibilities in edutainment for children by inventing unique new features that push the limits of tablets.  This book addresses the needs of tech savvy parents who want to make sure their children develop an interest in Art.  

In addition to the usual “read it yourself” and “read it to me” option that highlights words as they are read this book will include factoids that teach children about the masterpieces represented in the book.  Children will complete games or activities that teach them about Art History.  Upon completion of the activities, children acquire a reward in the form of a digital object representing the specific art piece.  

These objects are added to an art gallery that can be viewed by the child and compared online with other young collectors.  The online network will offer more games and factoids that will be available to add to the child’s art gallery.  These games have a scarcity engine built in with different levels of difficulty.  Just like hockey cards, baseball cards or more recently Pokémon™ cards, these will be tradable between participants.

We have already made a sizeable personal commitment with three years of work on Sharing Books to acquire and publish original books like Auguste Rodent.  Our development budget is $148,000.  This project has received a contribution of $50,000 from British Columbia Film and the Arts Council of British Columbia.  The shareholders of Shared Books Limited have contributed $68,000 to the intellectual property portion of the project.  We need $30,000 to complete the more advanced features of the book that will make this a truly exceptional Art History and Literacy experience for children.

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Let's get out there and bring to the Internet all those indigenous voices, rhythms and sounds we are missing from Mexico, let's reconnect with those communities that have been left out of mainstream media.</span></h4>
<h3>Hit the road!</h3> <p>In ancient times, people that lived in the Pacific side of what today is California and Mexico, were connected to a deer culture, which is why we call this sonic road project La Ruta del Venado (The Deer's Trail). <br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Mexican-American journalist, Ricardo Ibarra, started to broadcast Radio Indígena in the Radio Universidad de Guadalajara network in 2004. Now, 10 years from then, he wants to take a professional team on a tour through living indigenous communities established in the Pacific side of Mexico.</li>
<li>Since these communities don't have connection to Internet and are forgotten by mainstream media, nobody knows what is happening with them. We want to provide technology and human resources for them to manage their own local radio stations, to preserve language and culture, but first, we need to meet them and know them.</li>
<li>With your support, we will be able to visit them and upload in realtime audioclips, videos and photogalleries with their messages to you through a new Radio Indígena website, RadioIndigena.com/RutadelVenado or RutadelVenado.com.</li>
<li>Not just online, their messages will travel with us and shared in the next community we visit, from city to city, plaza to plaza, everyone will know that native language and culture is still alive and in need of ways for preservation.</li>
<li>
<span>In addition, we will create a sound library with more robust living indigenous languages ​​of Mexico's contemporary history.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Ricardo Ibarra. I'm a Mexican-American journalist who started RadioIndigena.org in 2004 after visiting the desert of Wirikuta in Mexico with the huichol family of don Pablo Taizán and after making a long trip through indigenous communities in the Pacific side of Mexico, from Sonora to Chiapas. In that journey, I noticed there was a huge need of reporting issues that happened in these villages that no one was covering. </p>
<p>10 years from then, there is still a need of knowing how are these indigenous tribes doing in these new times: How's their language, culture, health, and day to day battles. I believe that the only way to preserve human diversity is, first, knowing and communicating their situation. <br/></p>
<p>In that sense, the Ruta del Venado Project, is also intended to locate communities willing to hold a community radio station for their own organization and the preservation of their language and culture. That is what you and my team are going to build in this communication venture.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Connecting on the field <br/>
</h3>
<p>Of course, we would have prefered to make this road project on a UFO or at least on a green or hybrid vehicle, but our space in time and the needs of sleeping inside makes that quite impossible. So we need to get a van —a cheap one— for maybe $10,000. I know, so much for gas! In Mexico the gallon of diesel is around $3.65. Yeah, most of the collected budget will have to fill this bag. An almost straight line from Tijuana to Mexico City is around 3,000 kilometers, which means, for a van, near $1,000 the whole trip. And that's if we were in a —almost— straight line, which is pretty hard in this rocky road we will be taking.</p>
<p>Then there's the food department, where we will have to prepare our own food to fill our bellies —we haven't evolved to just consume oxygen– so, let's add that. Plus a mobile WiFi adapter.<br/></p>
<p>We will not get a salary as such, nor for driving the big truck, or for producing audioclips, videos and photo galleries in real time for you. Our income will come from sunsets and the smile of the people we meet.</p>
<p>Be sure any contribution you make to La Ruta del Venado Project will be used wisely, because we will be out there anyhow. Your support will make this much better, because, in the end, you will enjoy every production made on the road and uploaded to our website RutadelVenado.com, where your name will appear as a donator, fan and, why not, part of the team. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Reconnecting humanity<br/>
</h3> <p>There is something happening with people in the world. There seems to be too much violence, too much hate, too much war. We believe that in this battle, there are also peace and love warriors. We are counting with you on this side of the road, on the ""Deer's Trail"" (la Ruta del Venado).</p>
<p>It is time to reconnect with communities that despite having a long history of disposession and exploitaition, still remain rich in traditions connected to our Mother Earth, through music, dance, healing, eating, harvesting.</p>
<p>This Project, for us, is like rediscovering who we are as humanity in these fierceful times. If you have read until this point, you know we are counting on you.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The road is a beast<br/>
</h3> <p> We want to keep it real. Mexico is a land that is crossing through a difficult social fase. It is not an easy or safe trip. That's why we need your support and contribution. But also with the support of local organizations we will acomplish our journey until the end. <br/></p> <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Show your love<br/>
</h3> <p>If you can't help to grow our numbers on this campaign, you can sure share it in your social media accounts. Maybe you don't have the money, but you know some people. Send an e-mail. Make a phone call. Tweet. Post this on your Facebook wall. Share it on your blog. Write about it. Talk about the Ruta del Venado. Take the word out there. Join us!</p>
<p>We know that we are not alone to help Mexican indigenous communities have their word exposed to the world.</p>
<p><span>As often said Dr. Miguel León Portilla, professor at the UNAM:</span> ""There is a philosophy in every language. When a language dies, humanity is impoverished"".<br/></p>
<span>There are still 62 indigenous languages ​​in Mexico, let's do this together so we can keep them alive in this brutal and wonderful Mother Earth.</span><br/><br/><p></p>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/>Mi nombre es Ricardo Ibarra. Soy periodista mexicoamericano que comenzó RadioIndigena.org en 2004 después de visitar el desierto de Wirikuta en México con la familia wixárika de don Pablo Taizan, y después de hacer un largo viaje a través de las comunidades indígenas en el occidente, norte y sur de México, desde Baja California hasta Chiapas. En ese viaje, me di cuenta de que había una gran necesidad de reportar situaciones que sucedían en estos pueblos, y que nadie estaba contando. <br/><br/>A 10 años de entonces, todavía persiste la necesidad de conocer en qué condición se encuentran estas tribus originarias, qué hacen en estos nuevos tiempos: ¿En qué condición se encuentran sus lenguas, la cultura, la salud, y las pequeñas batallas del día a día. Considero que la única manera de preservar la diversidad humana es, en primer lugar, conocer y comunicar su situación. <br/><br/>En ese sentido, el proyecto de la Ruta del Venado también tiene la intención de localizar comunidades que quisieran mantener una radio comunitaria, para cuestiones propias de su organización, junto con la preservación de sus lenguas y culturas. Eso es lo que usted, como colaborador, junto con nuestro equipo vamos a construir en esta aventura de comunicación social. <br/><br/></span></h4>

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/>Por supuesto, habríamos preferido emprender este proyecto vial sobrevolando la tierra desde un OVNI o por lo menos en uno de esos vehículos ecológicos o híbridos, pero nuestro momento en el tiempo y las necesidades de tener un espacio amplio lo hacen casi imposible. Así que tenemos que conseguir una camioneta: una barata, de unos $10,000 dólares. Lo sé, ¡tanto gasto para la gasolina! En México, el galón de diesel está alrededor de $3.65 dls. Sí, la mayor parte del presupuesto recolectado en esta campaña tendrá que llenar esta bolsa.

</div></div>","Let's get out there and bring to the Internet all those indigenous voices, rhythms and sounds we are missing from Mexico, let's reconnect with those communities that have been left out of mainstream media.
Hit the road! In ancient times, people that lived in the Pacific side of what today is California and Mexico, were connected to a deer culture, which is why we call this sonic road project La Ruta del Venado (The Deer's Trail). 


Mexican-American journalist, Ricardo Ibarra, started to broadcast Radio Indígena in the Radio Universidad de Guadalajara network in 2004. Now, 10 years from then, he wants to take a professional team on a tour through living indigenous communities established in the Pacific side of Mexico.
Since these communities don't have connection to Internet and are forgotten by mainstream media, nobody knows what is happening with them. We want to provide technology and human resources for them to manage their own local radio stations, to preserve language and culture, but first, we need to meet them and know them.
With your support, we will be able to visit them and upload in realtime audioclips, videos and photogalleries with their messages to you through a new Radio Indígena website, RadioIndigena.com/RutadelVenado or RutadelVenado.com.
Not just online, their messages will travel with us and shared in the next community we visit, from city to city, plaza to plaza, everyone will know that native language and culture is still alive and in need of ways for preservation.

In addition, we will create a sound library with more robust living indigenous languages ​​of Mexico's contemporary history.


My name is Ricardo Ibarra. I'm a Mexican-American journalist who started RadioIndigena.org in 2004 after visiting the desert of Wirikuta in Mexico with the huichol family of don Pablo Taizán and after making a long trip through indigenous communities in the Pacific side of Mexico, from Sonora to Chiapas. In that journey, I noticed there was a huge need of reporting issues that happened in these villages that no one was covering. 
10 years from then, there is still a need of knowing how are these indigenous tribes doing in these new times: How's their language, culture, health, and day to day battles. I believe that the only way to preserve human diversity is, first, knowing and communicating their situation. 
In that sense, the Ruta del Venado Project, is also intended to locate communities willing to hold a community radio station for their own organization and the preservation of their language and culture. That is what you and my team are going to build in this communication venture.

  Connecting on the field 

Of course, we would have prefered to make this road project on a UFO or at least on a green or hybrid vehicle, but our space in time and the needs of sleeping inside makes that quite impossible. So we need to get a van —a cheap one— for maybe $10,000. I know, so much for gas! In Mexico the gallon of diesel is around $3.65. Yeah, most of the collected budget will have to fill this bag. An almost straight line from Tijuana to Mexico City is around 3,000 kilometers, which means, for a van, near $1,000 the whole trip. And that's if we were in a —almost— straight line, which is pretty hard in this rocky road we will be taking.
Then there's the food department, where we will have to prepare our own food to fill our bellies —we haven't evolved to just consume oxygen– so, let's add that. Plus a mobile WiFi adapter.
We will not get a salary as such, nor for driving the big truck, or for producing audioclips, videos and photo galleries in real time for you. Our income will come from sunsets and the smile of the people we meet.
Be sure any contribution you make to La Ruta del Venado Project will be used wisely, because we will be out there anyhow. Your support will make this much better, because, in the end, you will enjoy every production made on the road and uploaded to our website RutadelVenado.com, where your name will appear as a donator, fan and, why not, part of the team. 

  Reconnecting humanity
 There is something happening with people in the world. There seems to be too much violence, too much hate, too much war. We believe that in this battle, there are also peace and love warriors. We are counting with you on this side of the road, on the ""Deer's Trail"" (la Ruta del Venado).
It is time to reconnect with communities that despite having a long history of disposession and exploitaition, still remain rich in traditions connected to our Mother Earth, through music, dance, healing, eating, harvesting.
This Project, for us, is like rediscovering who we are as humanity in these fierceful times. If you have read until this point, you know we are counting on you.

  The road is a beast
  We want to keep it real. Mexico is a land that is crossing through a difficult social fase. It is not an easy or safe trip. That's why we need your support and contribution. But also with the support of local organizations we will acomplish our journey until the end.  
  Show your love
 If you can't help to grow our numbers on this campaign, you can sure share it in your social media accounts. Maybe you don't have the money, but you know some people. Send an e-mail. Make a phone call. Tweet. Post this on your Facebook wall. Share it on your blog. Write about it. Talk about the Ruta del Venado. Take the word out there. Join us!
We know that we are not alone to help Mexican indigenous communities have their word exposed to the world.
As often said Dr. Miguel León Portilla, professor at the UNAM: ""There is a philosophy in every language. When a language dies, humanity is impoverished"".
There are still 62 indigenous languages ​​in Mexico, let's do this together so we can keep them alive in this brutal and wonderful Mother Earth.

Español

Saldremos a traer a la Internet todas esas voces indígenas, ritmos y sonidos que nos estamos perdiendo de México. Vamos a reconectar con aquellas comunidades que han quedado fuera de los medios masivos de comunicación. 
¡Ponte en camino! 

En tiempos precortesianos, las personas que vivían en el lado del Pacífico de lo que hoy es California y México, se conectaron a una cultura asociada con los ciervos, por eso llamamos a este proyecto de campos sonoros la Ruta del Venado. 

Periodista mexicoamericano, Ricardo Ibarra, comenzó a transmitir Radio Indígena en Red Radio Universidad de Guadalajara, en 2004. Ahora, 10 años a partir de entonces, quiere llevar a un equipo de profesionales en un recorrido por las comunidades indígenas establecidas en el lado del Pacífico mexicano.
Dado que estas comunidades no tienen conexión a Internet, y son relegados por los medios tradicionales, poco se sabe de lo que está ocurriendo en estas localidades. Queremos ofrecer la tecnología y los recursos humanos para que puedan gestionar sus propias estaciones de radio, para preservar la lengua y la cultura, pero en primer lugar, tenemos que conocerlos.
Con su apoyo, podremos visitarlos y subir audioclips en ""tiempo real"", videos y galerías de fotos con mensajes en sus lenguas originarias, por medio de un nuevo sitio web: RadioIndigena.com/RutadelVenado o RutadelVenado.com. 
No sólo en línea, sus mensajes viajarán con nosotros y serán compartidos en la próxima comunidad que visitemos, de ciudad en ciudad,  de plaza en plaza. Además, todo el mundo conectado a Internet sabrá que el lenguaje y la cultura nativa sigue viva y en necesidad de urgentes formas de preservación. 
Además, crearemos la biblioteca sonora con lenguas indígenas vivas más robusta de la historia contemporánea mexicana.


Mi nombre es Ricardo Ibarra. Soy periodista mexicoamericano que comenzó RadioIndigena.org en 2004 después de visitar el desierto de Wirikuta en México con la familia wixárika de don Pablo Taizan, y después de hacer un largo viaje a través de las comunidades indígenas en el occidente, norte y sur de México, desde Baja California hasta Chiapas. En ese viaje, me di cuenta de que había una gran necesidad de reportar situaciones que sucedían en estos pueblos, y que nadie estaba contando. A 10 años de entonces, todavía persiste la necesidad de conocer en qué condición se encuentran estas tribus originarias, qué hacen en estos nuevos tiempos: ¿En qué condición se encuentran sus lenguas, la cultura, la salud, y las pequeñas batallas del día a día. Considero que la única manera de preservar la diversidad humana es, en primer lugar, conocer y comunicar su situación. En ese sentido, el proyecto de la Ruta del Venado también tiene la intención de localizar comunidades que quisieran mantener una radio comunitaria, para cuestiones propias de su organización, junto con la preservación de sus lenguas y culturas. Eso es lo que usted, como colaborador, junto con nuestro equipo vamos a construir en esta aventura de comunicación social. 
Conexión en el campo 

Por supuesto, habríamos preferido emprender este proyecto vial sobrevolando la tierra desde un OVNI o por lo menos en uno de esos vehículos ecológicos o híbridos, pero nuestro momento en el tiempo y las necesidades de tener un espacio amplio lo hacen casi imposible. Así que tenemos que conseguir una camioneta: una barata, de unos $10,000 dólares. Lo sé, ¡tanto gasto para la gasolina! En México, el galón de diesel está alrededor de $3.65 dls. Sí, la mayor parte del presupuesto recolectado en esta campaña tendrá que llenar esta bolsa. Una línea casi recta desde Tijuana a la Ciudad de México cubre unos 3,000 kilómetros, lo que significa que en una camioneta grande gastaríamos $1,000 por hacer ese recorrido. Y eso es en la suposición de hacer una trayectoria lineal, lo cual es bastante difícil, si consideramos el tipo proyecto de inmersión que vamos a realizar. Luego está el departamento de comida, donde tendremos que preparar nuestros propios alimentos para llenar nuestros estómagos. Además de un adaptador WiFi móvil que nos permitirá enlazar con la ""Constelación del Huarache"", es decir, el ciberespacio. No vamos a obtener un salario como tal, ni por conducir la camioneta ni por producir para ti los audioclips, videos y galerías de fotos en tiempo real. Nuestros ingresos vendrán de las puestas de sol y la sonrisa de la gente que conoceremos en el camino. Tenga la seguridad de que toda contribución suya al proyecto de la Ruta del Venado será utilizada sabiamente. Su apoyo hará que este viaje de reconexión con los pueblos originarios sea mucho mejor, porque, al final, podrá disfrutar de todas las producciones hechas en la carretera y montadas en el sitio web RutadelVenado.com, donde su nombre aparecerá como uno de nuestros colaboradores y, por qué no, parte del equipo. 
Volver a conectar la humanidad 

Hay algo que está sucediendo con la gente en el mundo. Parece que hay demasiada violencia, demasiado odio, demasiada guerra. Creemos que en esta batalla, también hay guerreros de paz y de amor. Contamos con ustedes en este lado de la carretera, en la Ruta del Venado. Es hora de volver a conectar con las comunidades, que a pesar de tener una larga historia de desposesión y explotación, mantienen ricas tradiciones conectadas a nuestra Madre Tierra, a través de la música, la danza, la curación, la agricultura. Este proyecto, para nosotros, es como redescubrir lo que somos como humanidad en estos tiempos feroces. Si usted ha leído hasta este punto, sabe que estamos contando con usted. 
El camino es una bestia 

Queremos mantenerlo real. México es un país que atraviesa una situación social difícil con un Estado fallido. No es un viaje fácil o seguro. Es por eso que necesitamos su apoyo y contribución. Pero también con el apoyo de organizaciones locales lograremos atravesar nuestro viaje el final, que es la Ciudad de México, donde presentaremos una primera edición del material recolectado.

The book has massive potential and a parallel series about a young girl with a submarine is in the pipeline. Merchandising of Space Ranger Fred is planned with colouring books, toys and more. $15,000 kicks off the project.With the right support not just financially but from the right people this project can change lives. TimelineAll of the above can happen quite fast with the required funding. Each book takes 4 to 6 weeks to complete with a further week to tweak.  Book launches can happen as soon as each book is released and within 12 months between 9 and 10 Space Ranger Fred books can be on the market helping young kids learn a few things and begin to love the joy of reading. Within 18 months the books can begin to be translated and from there who knows where Fred will end up. With early funding books can be made ready for some superb Christmas stocking fillers. Thank youI thank you in advance for supporting this campaign, your support will impact and change many lives.  As the success grows many books will be donated to good causes (as many already have) and into areas or schools that are less advantaged than others - there is a massive element of giving back in this campaign and that has been my plan since day one.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My mom’s chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which was under control for eight years, suddenly spiraled out of control sending my mom, and my family at her side, in and out of the hospital for the next six months. The very system that I was studying to improve was now responsible for keeping my mom alive.</p><p>This immersive, challenging, heart-wrenching and deeply revealing experience, along with my formal education &amp; experience, has given me a unique view of the American healthcare system, and how it cares for our nation’s sickest patients. This book explores the ways in which innovators and healthcare professionals are already striving to change the system in order to promote population wellness in the face of a national cost and quality crisis. Healthcare is ripe for disruption at the hands of those who dare to think differently. </p><p>Exploring innovation at the intersection of health policy, medicine, and digital health technology, the book bridges the gap between fields that currently fail to work together in the support of our nation's patients. Through the lens of innovative digital health start-ups, big tech companies, entrepreneurs, highly respected policy researchers, actual patients, and my family's tragic story, this book shows how we <strong>can</strong> and <strong>will</strong> innovate to improve the system. The book highlights how innovators must focus on building solutions that solve problems at the patient's level to improve health and support wellbeing through a fundamental shift from reactive to proactive healthcare services.</p><p>This book discusses the hottest topics in healthcare reform and innovation, illustrating it all through the perspective of caring for an acutely ill patient. Throughout the book, the pressures and motivations driving modern healthcare in the U.S. are explored as new business models and solutions are introduced from an insider perspective. </p><p>My name is Robert Longyear and I am the author of <i>Innovating for Wellness</i>. </p><p>I wrote this book because it is time to change the ways in which we approach reforming the deeply flawed and broken healthcare system. We are all patients. And, at the crucial moment when we need its support the most, the healthcare system too often fails to provide it. <strong>It’s time to make important changes and to think differently about how we pay for and deliver care to our nation's sickest patients. </strong></p><p><br/>My hope is that in reading this book you will catch a glimpse of the behind the scenes efforts being made to fundamentally alter and disrupt the way healthcare services are provided to patients, as well as to gain insights into how healthcare will look &amp; feel in 20 years based on the <u>innovations happening right now</u>. <br/><br/>In this book, I will illustrate the ways in which successful innovations and research can drive real improvements for patients and their struggle to navigate a system that was built not to keep people well, but to repair them once they are already sick. <br/><br/>In this book, you will find several stories like these:</p><ul>
<li>A new tech start-up that is changing the face of healthcare services and driving real positive change using a simple system</li>
<li>How big tech companies are already changing the way healthcare works</li>
<li>A mom, suddenly thrown at the mercy of the U.S. healthcare system, and the ways in which things could go differently in the future </li>
<li>The man who has dedicated his life to changing the ways we pay for healthcare to incentivize health rather than revenue; the father of the Accountable Care Organization</li>

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
 

Thank you so much for of all of your kindness & support!

<h3>The Story of <i>Out of OCD</i>
</h3>OCD is one of the top 10 most debilitating and chronic disorders in the world but is still largely misunderstood. If you are suffering from OCD, you may feel alone, ashamed, confused, and, well, crazy. You are not alone. This book can show you a way out and a way forward.<br/><br/>My name is Toi Hershman, I am the author of <i>Out of OCD</i>. I wrote this book because I have OCD and FINALLY, after over 30 years of dealing with this disorder and fighting, I found the right help. I don’t want ANYONE else to wait that long. I wrote this book because I had to. I always felt alone and nuts with my secret disorder. If this book helps just one person seek and find their way out, it is a huge success. <br/><br/>This book is my memoir based on my experience with this beast/bully called OCD. Your experience will not be exactly the same, but I know you will see yourself in these pages. I hope to convey the utter frustration and helplessness felt with OCD and how escaping from this hellacious mental prison is achievable. <br/><br/><i>Out of OCD</i> speaks to OCD sufferers and those who love them. It is for ALL of you who are grappling with this horrible mental illness and aims to provide not only a path out of the OCD prison but what you learn and get from having OCD that will make you the strongest person you know. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Out of OCD</i> inspires you and helps you find your own way out of your OCD.<p>Are you struggling because most therapists you have seen really don’t help you? This book will help you decipher the good from the bad.</p>
<p>Do you feel like OCD is chronic and you cannot get better? You have OCD. However, you do NOT have to live by OCD’s rules. You can make OCD work for you. You will always have OCD... but OCD doesn’t always have to have you!</p>
<p>Are you sick and tired of having an evil micromanager taking up 90 percent or more of your brain space? Yep. Me too. I talk a lot about that and what you can gain from being free of this OCD gremlin. </p>
<p>Are you mad because OCD is largely exploited in the media and the term is thrown around like an adjective? “Aw, dude! I am so OCD about that...” Yep, that pisses me off too! They have NO idea. This book sheds some light on that one as well. </p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you. I hope you enjoy the book. Thank you, and, I love you! </p>

<p>Tucker has cystic fibrosis--and a lot of living to do!  He's just 24 years old, and has had a rough year with long hospital stays, and tough decisions ahead.  Tucker's lungs are damaged from the thick mucus that CF's defective gene creates and builds up, creating rich environments for chronic infections. </p>

<p>Like many CF patients who are living into adulthood, Tucker has had insurance nightmares.  It's tough to have full-time work with benefits when you spend large chunks of time in the hospital, and Medicaid hasn't quite caught on that CF patients are living longer, and need appropirate coverage. </p>
<p>In the 1950's, CF patients were not expected to live to start kindergarten.</p>
<p>Today, young adults with CF are doing amazing things--surfing, running, holding babies up in air!  Carving pumpkins!  Living.  Breathing.  Waitiing for a cure. </p>
<div>

<h3><strong>UPDATE Oct. 2: </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Friends and family, your generous contributions helped me hit my funding benchmark before I even touched down in Venezuela.

<h3><strong>To ensure I rasied money, I did not include the cost of internal country travel, expenses, or any of the labour I will spend editing pieces upon my return.  Any donations over the initial $940 will fund those expenses, and the work I will be doing on the ground while here.

<h3><strong>Also, there´s still some good perks left, so get them while you can! </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Always, </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>x ace.<br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>About the Project</strong></h3>
<div>In 2009, I was a Fulbright scholar to Venezuela working with a video collective that empowers people with basic video skills to organize their communities. I was so impressed by their work, that I co-founded a video cooperative in Portland, OR, where I have been working for the past two years as a writer and videographer dedicated to covering issues of social justice in my community. <br/><p>This October, I will return to Venezuela to report on the historic elections taking place from a people's movement perspective. In order to do this, I need to raise $940 to cover the cost of travel. With your help, I will be able to write four articles, interviewing key members of Venezuela's social movements, and ensure that English-speaking audiences can follow what's really happening on the ground.</p>
<h3><strong>Where the $'s Going</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>While transportation and food are subsidized in Venezuela (they only pay 10 cents/gallon of gas!), the plane ticket is extremely expensive. This is because thousands of Venezuelans currently living in the United States are flying home to vote on October 7. Despite this, Venezuela's democracy and people are so important to me that I've already bought my ticket. Once on the ground, I'll bus around as cheap as possible, and eat big family style meals of rice and beans. With your help, I'll be able to have a birthday cake when I come back...not just a big credit card bill.</div>
<div>
<h3>About the Impact</h3>
There is an unprecedented amount at stake during this election process, and virtually no U.S. coverage is reporting from the ground up. While the mainstream press is focusing on the left/right politics of Venezuela's elections, it is largely ignoring the voices of an entire network of independent media makers, community activists, and the new lower-middle class that form the backbone of the progressive populace that either candidate will have to answer to if they are elected President.  In fact, most U.S. coverage actually deepens misconceptions about the nature of Venezuela's democracy, the extent of crime and corruption, freedom of the press, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To counter this lack of analysis, I will write a series of blog posts and articles chronicling the reflections, criticisms, and suggestions of the community activists who will continue doing their work regardless of the election results.   My goal is to frame the election for U.S. readers, so that they understand the divided nature of the Venezuelan political scene, and the inherent class divisions that it usually runs along.  I hope to open up some of the nuance, and address some of the confusion, that surrounds Venezuela's political situation. </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This project needs an engaged community to help me pull it off. Even if you aren't able to support me financially, there are lots of other ways to help. You could post the campaign on your Facebook account, so that other people who might be interested can learn about what I'm doing, or tweet about it to people who would be interested in seeing the sort of coverage I'll provide.  You could also email it to any friends or co-workers you have with similar interests.  Finally, as I start to write articles, you could read them and share them on the internet as well, letting people know how they can support the project.  Every little bit counts.</p>

If I raise a significant amount over my goal, I will also be able to donate some of the audio-visual equipment I brought with me to the video cooperatives here, and replace it upon turning home.
Also, there´s still some good perks left, so get them while you can! 
Always, 
x ace.
About the Project
In 2009, I was a Fulbright scholar to Venezuela working with a video collective that empowers people with basic video skills to organize their communities. I was so impressed by their work, that I co-founded a video cooperative in Portland, OR, where I have been working for the past two years as a writer and videographer dedicated to covering issues of social justice in my community. This October, I will return to Venezuela to report on the historic elections taking place from a people's movement perspective. In order to do this, I need to raise $940 to cover the cost of travel. With your help, I will be able to write four articles, interviewing key members of Venezuela's social movements, and ensure that English-speaking audiences can follow what's really happening on the ground.
Where the $'s Going

While transportation and food are subsidized in Venezuela (they only pay 10 cents/gallon of gas!), the plane ticket is extremely expensive. This is because thousands of Venezuelans currently living in the United States are flying home to vote on October 7. Despite this, Venezuela's democracy and people are so important to me that I've already bought my ticket. Once on the ground, I'll bus around as cheap as possible, and eat big family style meals of rice and beans. With your help, I'll be able to have a birthday cake when I come back...not just a big credit card bill.

About the Impact
There is an unprecedented amount at stake during this election process, and virtually no U.S. coverage is reporting from the ground up. While the mainstream press is focusing on the left/right politics of Venezuela's elections, it is largely ignoring the voices of an entire network of independent media makers, community activists, and the new lower-middle class that form the backbone of the progressive populace that either candidate will have to answer to if they are elected President.  In fact, most U.S. coverage actually deepens misconceptions about the nature of Venezuela's democracy, the extent of crime and corruption, freedom of the press, etc.
 
To counter this lack of analysis, I will write a series of blog posts and articles chronicling the reflections, criticisms, and suggestions of the community activists who will continue doing their work regardless of the election results.   My goal is to frame the election for U.S. readers, so that they understand the divided nature of the Venezuelan political scene, and the inherent class divisions that it usually runs along.  I hope to open up some of the nuance, and address some of the confusion, that surrounds Venezuela's political situation. 

Other Ways You Can Help
This project needs an engaged community to help me pull it off. Even if you aren't able to support me financially, there are lots of other ways to help. You could post the campaign on your Facebook account, so that other people who might be interested can learn about what I'm doing, or tweet about it to people who would be interested in seeing the sort of coverage I'll provide.  You could also email it to any friends or co-workers you have with similar interests.  Finally, as I start to write articles, you could read them and share them on the internet as well, letting people know how they can support the project.  Every little bit counts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>For the last 3 years I have slowly been working on a memoir called ""Because We Are Trees"" about growing up on Cape Cod. While that might sound quaint and like it's about seashells, it's about my life...so it's whatever the opposite of quaint is. In order to complete this manuscript, I've got to do research in New England with my family members. I set aside time to do this after I go to Vermont Studio Center from early July to Early August. I was accepted off the waitlist and given a partial scholarship, but was just alerted to the fact they wanted $2450 by June 6th. ***Update, after assessing the financial situation that attending VSC would put me in, I have determined that it no longer makes sense for me to attend this year, which is unfortunate. However, I am still very much going to be writing and researching in New England this summer, and want to make sure that I am able to do so without bankrupting myself. Please assist me in completing this work. All donations will get a thank you in the acknowledgements of the memoir! Much love!</h3>

</p><p>2/15/16 – I'm doubling my stretch goal, to take the current $1565 raised and turn it into a flat $3000. Why? Because that would cut at least TWO MONTHS off my savings time in Kansas, toward infusion treatment. If that happens, I can be sitting in an infusion lab chair in just SIX MONTHS time! And it literally makes me shake with desperation to think that by next Christmas, I could be DONE with infusion, and my Lyme Disease could be in full remission!! I never thought I'd raise $1565, but now that I have, I'm pushing for a full MIRACLE. I once thought infusion treatment would be impossible. Then I figured it would be close to a decade before I'd ever be able to hope to save up enough to pay for it. To think now, that I'm only $1500 away from having this treatment in just half a year??!! I'm shaking my head...but maybe...just maybe...There really is a chance now. &lt;3</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>2/14/16 – <b>New Stretch Goal: $2500.</b></p><p>There are plenty of perks to choose from at this point, so...I never thought I'd make it this far. My original plan was to get the money for the house and simply SELL all of my belongings, or give everything to Good Will, or leave boxes of free stuff on the side of the road, or a combination of all three. Because I never thought to even hope to raise enough money to get into the house AND keep my belongings or move any of them with me. I was going to hone it down to a few boxes and other things I absolutely can't get rid of (like photo albums of my kids when they were born and really young, some old baby outfits I saved, and other nostalgic things, etc.) that still can't fit into the car with me and the cats, and those few must-keep items would go into a smallest-of-the-small and cheapest-of-the-cheap storage closet here in Salem.</p><p>Well, here we are, I've met my initial goal and my first stretch goal...and now we're to the point where I might not have to get rid of ALL my things, maybe rent a slightly larger (double closet?) storage unit, to save more of my things to retrieve later on. Another $1000 and I can keep half my things in a larger storage unit long enough to come back in a uhaul (or save for a uhaul or van line company to bring my things later on), and not get rid of EVERYTHING I own...I just never thought my campaign would even go this far. So, it has, and now I'm throwing in the new extra $1000 stretch goal of not having to sell everything I own in order to complete this move to Kansas. So, PLEASE, consider ordering one of my perks. Maybe this move won't need to be as complicated as I once thought it would be. Maybe we can get my move to only medium-complicated, lol. We'll see.</p><p>As usual, however, I appreciate everything you all have done for me so far. More than you all will ever know. &lt;3 Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. I definitely feel a bit more loved this week than last. :)</p><p><i>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><br/></p><p>2/12/16<b> – New Stretch Goal PERK Added! </b><br/></p><p>A new perk. For $40 you can now order a SIGNED copy of <i>Lyrical Tales: Collected Poems and Photography</i>, by Jennifer Word. The poetry and art book just released today (2/12/16), and you can have it signed and delivered to your doorstep. (only ships to United States and Canada).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455317907/xxj51ktzximfnqzxmzop.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>2/11/16<br/></p><p><b>STRETCH GOAL!!!!!</b> After only TWO DAYS, it's already time for me to add a stretch goal of $1,500 to reach in the next twelve days!! (and I've already messaged my Atchison, KS Realtor to move forward on the BID for the house I've been looking at!!). The stretch goal could go towards helping me fund the extra costs of the actual move, on top of the 1% down and closing fees for the house. I mean, I will need to stop at motels along the way on my drive with my cats from Salem, OR to Atchison, KS. The drive will take at least 3-4 days, plus motels, gas, and food costs. So, adding a stretch goal of another $500 is probably a smart thing to do, to make this miracle happenstance go as smoothly and stress-free (yeah, right) as possible. But whether we make the stretch goal or not, I'm making a bid on the house. If this happens, it will literally change my whole life for the better. &lt;3</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>2/09/16<br/></p><p>This
 is not easy for me. I don't like ""begging"" for money. And I'm not 
looking for a handout. Just to get all of that out of the way up front.</p><p>As
 many of you know, I have been battling Lyme Disease for over five years
 now. I didn't even get diagnosed properly (didn't even know it was Lyme
 Disease that I had) until October 20, 2014, a little less than a 
year-and-a-half ago. I have been on oral antibiotics EVER SINCE. And it 
has helped to improve a few of my symptoms a tiny bit, but not all that 
much. I'm still severely disabled, 150 pounds overweight (I was a size 6
 before the infamous ""tick bite""), now I am a size 3X (utterly 
humiliating), and I still suffer from severe edema if I remain in an 
upright position for more than about 2-3 hours in any given 24 hour 
period of time. In other words, to avoid a potential STROKE, I must 
remain horizontal, lying down either in my bed or on my couch for most 
of each day. This has been the only thing to even remotely reduce my 
high blood pressure.</p><p>As some of you perhaps don't know, 
this is also the very reason I have been given roughly TEN more years to
 live. Given my physical state, without any stronger treatment for my 
disease, and barring divine intervention, if I remain on oral 
antibiotics alone, this disease will progress, and not even being 
bedridden will save me from the inevitable stroke and/or heart attack 
that will undoubtedly kill me. Barring those two outcomes, the high 
level of pain killers I take nearly every day to make the full bodied 
rheumatoid arthritis that I also suffer from as a direct result of Lyme 
Disease bearable, will eventually take its toll on my internal organs 
(most notably my pancreas and liver) and this will in turn cause even 
more pain, more meds internally ingested and eventually multiple organ 
failure. If I don't have a stroke or heart attack first, I can look 
forward to developing pancreatitis (painful and incurable), liver 
cirrhosis, and/or kidney failure.</p><p>And all of this will 
happen if my disease remains on its current course. I have been on oral 
antibiotics every day now for fourteen months, and still spend most of 
my days in a lot of pain, and lying down. I do all my work for EMP 
Publishing on my couch, in my home. I'm doing the best I can in the 
situation I have found myself in. And one small grace, in trying to find
 something to do to fill my days (rather than just stare at the TV and 
vegetate) is that in founding my publishing company (originally simply 
to publish all of my OWN writing before I die), I've discovered that I'm
 actually pretty darn good at it. My books look beautiful (who knew I 
had a knack for interior layout design?), and I work very well with 
other authors (I never considered myself a ""people person"" before!). So,
 I now have a publishing company on a fast track to actually being 
successful, i.e. this could end up being my full time job and career 
(that I LOVE!), and I am able to work from home. What I can't do is 
actually go for a walk for basic exercise. The exact and varying 
symptoms of my chronic disease would take forever to explain.</p><p>In
 the past, as many of you again (perhaps) know, I have run fundraisers 
to try and raise tens of thousands of dollars for help in treating my 
Lyme Disease, and also in the past to raise money to fund my own 
personal publishing projects (my life's work before I die). This was 
simply too much. It is too much. I cannot ask for or expect my community
 of friends, family and peers to donate $10K for the basic round of 
infusion treatment (it's the exact same as Chemo, only with high potency
 liquid antibiotics, straight into a port installed in my heart) I need 
to have done, in order to kick my Chronic Lyme Disease into remission 
(at the advanced stage of my disease, remission is the outcome, not a 
""cure""). I may need to have a round of infusion treatment again 3-5 
years down the road, but it's a much more effective treatment than the 
ineffective antibiotic pills I swallow down 3 times a day that only slow
 my body's degeneration. There's no hope of recovering any real quality 
of life without the more aggressive infusion treatment.</p><p>But
 it's too much to ask for that. A round of antibiotic infusion treatment
 (2-3 times a week for 8-12 weeks), at an outpatient infusion lab (they 
are found in every single state in our country) would run a cool $10K. I
 am not asking for that. But I have been praying to God (these are 
simply my own personal religious beliefs) and I believe He has shown me a
 way to rebuild my life.</p><p>Where there is a will, there is a
 way. As they say, right? I work from home. And I have an independent 
income of alimony (and child support) from my unfortunate divorce. 
Without that monthly support, I would be living with family members and 
burdening them, so I am very grateful (not for the divorce, obviously, 
but) for the fact that I do have a monthly ""income"", especially in light
 of my inability to work a job outside the home in my current physical 
condition.</p><p>But I have EMP Publishing. And it's going very 
well. I hope to build my company up to at the very least be a 
supplemental income for me for when I do return to work (with the Grace 
of God) and am finally able, once again, to go outside my home and earn 
money at a job. But my current situation lends itself perfectly to being
 nomadic, if you will. I can go anywhere in the country and still run 
EMP Publishing. I can go anywhere in the country and still retain the 
25% custody of my two teenagers that I now have. I moved to Oregon, not 
by choice, but out of financial necessity. I'm not getting any better, 
physically, and remaining in Southern California was simply not working.</p><p>But
 as I've said, I believe God has shown me a way. On a lark, I applied 
for a home loan. (Lark meaning, I randomly clicked on the ""get 
pre-approved"" button on Zillow one afternoon while daydreaming). With my
 current credit score lower due to the large amount of medical debt I've
 taken on over the last several years, and my savings GONE, I never 
thought a house could possibly be in my future. My life changed roughly 8
 weeks ago (early December) when I was pre-approved for a home loan with
 Quicken, under their new Rocket program (did anyone see that awesome 
commercial during the Superbowl?!, I started screaming, ""That's MY 
loan!!""). But I wasn't approved for a whole lot, considering my 
finances. $75K. That's what I was granted. On pre-approval. Of course, I
 looked in Oregon first. And there's nothing. Nothing that cheap. And in
 livable condition. The Rocket loan program states the house must be 
100% ""turnkey"" condition, i.e., ready to move into and live freely. No 
""as-is"", no ""fixer upper"", not ""This house just needs a little TLC"". 
Turnkey. And under $75K.</p><p>That's harder to find that you 
might think. I began scouring the entire COUNTRY eight weeks ago, 
desperately trying to find a house under $75K that is turnkey. Because, 
given the right situation, all other expenses considered equal (the 
utilities for the area, the cost of winter heating or summer cooling, 
etc.) a mortgage on a house at $75K or under, versus what I'm currently 
paying for my rent here in Salem, OR (which is already 50% cheaper than 
where I just moved from outside of L.A.) would mean an extra $500/month 
of leftover income for me to use.</p><p>And THAT will get me the
 $10K I need to raise to pay for my OWN infusion treatment to kick my 
Lyme Disease into remission. The keys to the kingdom for me, lie in 
raising the money for the house I have found, after scouring the entire 
country. I settled on KANSAS. The Midwest, as it turns out, is the most 
affordable place in the United States. Right smack-dab in the middle of 
the country. I found the perfect little town (only 30 minutes outside of
 Kansas City, KS, the LARGEST city in the state), Lyme Specialists to 
choose from in all directions and within less than 45 minutes drive (and
 more importantly INFUSION labs), and I can even hit bordering states of
 Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri if needs be (but everything I'd need 
medically is right there in KC). A cute little town called Atchison 
(those of you who REALLY know me will know I love this: Atchison is 
billed as the ""most haunted town in Kansas""!!). Population just under 
11,000. And the perfect little, one story, 1388 square foot 
home with a very nice (and DRY) basement, for $45K. And a Rocket Loan from
 Quicken requiring only 1% down. So, I need to raise roughly $450 for 
the initial 1% down payment. Then I need (estimated, I mean, I've never 
bought a home before, and I'm flippin' 40-years-old here) another 
roughly $450 or so for all the random ""closing costs"" upon purchasing 
the home and actually paying taxes and transfer title fees, etc. And I 
need an additional $325 (my Realtor has told me THIS exact amount for 
certain) for the home's appraisal/inspection. I want to make certain 
before putting in a final bid that I'm not buying something that ""looks""
 great, but has hidden mold in the walls, or termite damage, or sits on 
land emitting ridiculously  high levels of Radon, for whatever reason, 
or that the walls aren't covered in LEAD paint, etc.), so YES I'm having
 an inspection done. So:</p><p>$450</p><p>$450</p><p>$325</p><p>Comes
 to a grand total of $1,225. However, I have a very wonderful and 
incredible friend who has already offered to give me $500 to help me 
make this happen, so minus that $500, I need roughly $725. I have 
rounded back up to $1000 to help me cover the cost of hiring movers to 
move all my things from my current apartment here in Salem, OR, into a 
storage unit. I'd be driving myself and a few belongings (plus my two 
cats) halfway across the country to move into this little house in 
Atchison, KS, and leaving my things behind (most of which I plan to sell
 or donate to Goodwill anyhow, so my storage unit will be smaller and 
hopefully minimal cost). Even factoring a storage unit of roughly 
$100/mo into the equation, if I can get this house in Atchison and begin
 paying the mortgage on a $45K home, I will be looking at a monthly 
savings of over $500/month. (ALL other things considered, I've already 
researched the cost of all utilities, groceries, gas, etc. and it's 
actually another 10% cheaper than here in Salem), which I then plan to 
use to pay off my medical debt (another huge stress that doesn't help my
 physical or emotional health) while simultaneously saving up the $10K I
 need to pay for my OWN infusion treatment.</p><p>So, no more 
fundraisers or ""begging"" for money ever again. And certainly not even 
this time around, for tens of thousands of dollars. I need to raise 
roughly $1000. That's it. After that, I truly believe I can create a 
life for myself where I take over, save the money myself, and pay for my
 own medical treatment, no more having to ask anyone for money for 
anything EVER again.</p><p>So, this one last time, I'm telling 
myself. And not for a whole lot. Not for some crazy amount of money that
 I cannot expect anyone to be able to donate for me. And this way, I am 
enabled to help myself. With just one small step of raising the lesser 
amount of $1000, I can then take control of my finances, my life, my 
Lyme Disease treatment and management, etc.</p><p>What would YOU
 be able to do with an extra $500 every month just suddenly handed to 
you? If I can raise the money needed to buy this house and move to 
Atchison, KS, it opens the door, it creates the way, the path, towards 
rebuilding my life. No more begging after this.</p><p>So, I am 
not trying to look for a handout here. To risk sounding cheesy, I'm 
looking for one last ""hand UP"". And then I can take it from there. And 
this WILL change my entire life. This will make a life and a future for 
myself possible. This will give me hope. This would erase that 'TEN 
YEAR' death sentence of not expecting to live beyond age 50, because I'd
 have the hope (and it WILL happen) of getting infusion treatment within
 a year to a year-and-a-half after moving into a financial situation 
where I suddenly have an extra $500 per month to put towards my medical 
goals of treatment. I want to save that $10K myself. And I CAN do it, if
 I can just come up with $1000. And I don't want to lose this perfect 
house (turnkey, in a haunted town, only $45K), I want to be the one to 
bid on it, before someone else takes it off the market. I want to be 
able to bid on that house before the end of February.</p><p>So, 
this is a fundraiser. And it's ""Operation: Save Jen"". I'm not trying to 
be overly dramatic here, but this could literally change my entire life 
for the better...and eventually and actually prolong my life back to a 
more normal lifespan expectancy.</p><p>Also, once I'm in the 
home, the loan and mortgage set in place, I have further been 
pre-approved for a business loan from Wells Fargo (my bank) for $5-$10K 
to help me run EMP Publishing for the next few years without it costing 
ME anymore out of my personal and monthly budget. So, despite the new 
monthly installment to pay off said business loan, that would actually 
INCREASE my monthly budget again by another $200 per month or more.</p><p>I'm
 looking at a DREAM life, with health, longevity, a HOUSE (another dream
 of mine, which is why I was even on stupid Zillow to begin with, 
drooling, lol), the perfect town for me (come on, if you KNOW me, then 
moving to the ""most haunted town"" in any state is SO Jen, lol), I was 
born two days before Halloween, and I LOVE spooky things. I mean, come 
on, EMP's main ""thing"" is an extreme horror quarterly publication! (this
 house I want isn't haunted, though, it was built in 1977, lol). It's 
not haunted...I checked. ;)</p><p>So...it's a fundraiser. I'm 
asking for money. From whoever wants to donate, and for however much you
 can spare or afford. And as soon as possible, so I can BID on that 
house and get it, and set in motion my move there (to Kansas, of all 
places, lol), and begin saving myself for everything else I need. I'm 
not offering perks, really. Although, I supposed I could put a few up 
where I simply offer to send paperback copies of books that EMP 
Publishing puts out over the next year, if that makes some people feel 
more ""okay"" with this, rather than just simply ""donating"".<br/></p><p>Otherwise,
 aside from those few perks, this is a straight up fundraiser asking for
 donations. It's the only thing I know to do at this point. I've tried 
raising the funds with taking on extraneous editing projects on the 
side, but it hasn't been nearly enough. I tried to WORK to raise the 
money, as best as I could. I did try. And I asked close friends, but no 
one has the means (it's hard for everyone right now), except for one 
friend of mine, and as I've said, they are funding me with $500. But I 
still need that tiny bit more. And then I'll be in a situation where I 
can FINALLY help myself.</p><p>If you've made it this far, I 
apologize for writing a book, but I'm not very good at explaining this 
whole situation in under 1000 words...it's a complicated situation, and 
if you don't already know any of this, well...this long story explains 
everything.</p><p>Any amount will help. And I've still got a few
 more things to try and sell on Craigslist. I'm trying to make this 
happen as much on my own as I can. My own family doesn't have the means 
to help, but maybe if enough of my friends and peers on FB and Twitter, 
etc., come together, we can all make this happen for me. Whoever cares 
to, anyhow, and has the means.</p><p>We've all read these types 
of statements, ""If you gave just $1""....or ""If everyone gave just $3 
right now..."" yada-yada. Well, it's true...if every single one of my 
friends on FB literally gave $1, I'd have more than triple what I need 
to build my life. So, I only need one third or less of you guys to give 
$1 (not too much of a hardship, right?), or even just 5% of you to give 
$5, and I could build up my life and make all this happen.</p><p>Or you can order your book perks package from EMP Publishing, lol.</p><p>Now,
 I'm not putting up a video. I know they help. But I'm still too ashamed
 of how ugly and gross I look, going from 138 pounds to 275. I'm not 
putting myself on video again. That was too hard, and too humiliating. 
And I'd rather have people think of me and remember how I used to look. 
Because maybe, if I can get that treatment and get better, I can hope 
(as vain as it is to do so) to look a bit more attractive again someday.
 More like the old me now trapped inside my new, sick body. :( So, no 
video, folks, sorry.</p><p>And that's that. Give if you can or 
want. Judge me harshly, call me a beggar. Be disappointed in me. Tell me
 I'm a loser. Or just support me this one last time and give from the 
goodness of your heart. I've gotten every reaction across the board 
already. I've grown a thick skin. I can take it.</p><p>Thank you
 all (those of you who bothered to take the time to read this whole 
ridiculous thing). I appreciate that. And I appreciate you. I personally
 believe God is overseeing this whole thing. Why He's doing it this way,
 I don't understand. But I'm going to trust it. Whatever your own 
personal religious beliefs are...whether you believe in God or not, or a
 different God than mine (I never said who my ""He"" was...) if you feel 
anything (a small whisper in your ear or your mind) urging you to help. 
Don't ignore it. I think magic is happening here. And I want to get 
better, tell this stupid Lyme Disease to get the f*ck out of my body and
 my life, reclaim my future and my dreams, continue running and building
 up my career and my publishing company, and take my LIFE back, and I 
want to do it in a haunted town in Kansas, darnit!!!</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Jen Word</p><br/></div>","2/15/16 – I'm doubling my stretch goal, to take the current $1565 raised and turn it into a flat $3000. Why? Because that would cut at least TWO MONTHS off my savings time in Kansas, toward infusion treatment. If that happens, I can be sitting in an infusion lab chair in just SIX MONTHS time! And it literally makes me shake with desperation to think that by next Christmas, I could be DONE with infusion, and my Lyme Disease could be in full remission!! I never thought I'd raise $1565, but now that I have, I'm pushing for a full MIRACLE. I once thought infusion treatment would be impossible. Then I figured it would be close to a decade before I'd ever be able to hope to save up enough to pay for it. To think now, that I'm only $1500 away from having this treatment in just half a year??!! I'm shaking my head...but maybe...just maybe...There really is a chance now. <3-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2/14/16 – New Stretch Goal: $2500.There are plenty of perks to choose from at this point, so...I never thought I'd make it this far. My original plan was to get the money for the house and simply SELL all of my belongings, or give everything to Good Will, or leave boxes of free stuff on the side of the road, or a combination of all three. Because I never thought to even hope to raise enough money to get into the house AND keep my belongings or move any of them with me. I was going to hone it down to a few boxes and other things I absolutely can't get rid of (like photo albums of my kids when they were born and really young, some old baby outfits I saved, and other nostalgic things, etc.) that still can't fit into the car with me and the cats, and those few must-keep items would go into a smallest-of-the-small and cheapest-of-the-cheap storage closet here in Salem.Well, here we are, I've met my initial goal and my first stretch goal...and now we're to the point where I might not have to get rid of ALL my things, maybe rent a slightly larger (double closet?) storage unit, to save more of my things to retrieve later on. Another $1000 and I can keep half my things in a larger storage unit long enough to come back in a uhaul (or save for a uhaul or van line company to bring my things later on), and not get rid of EVERYTHING I own...I just never thought my campaign would even go this far. So, it has, and now I'm throwing in the new extra $1000 stretch goal of not having to sell everything I own in order to complete this move to Kansas. So, PLEASE, consider ordering one of my perks. Maybe this move won't need to be as complicated as I once thought it would be. Maybe we can get my move to only medium-complicated, lol. We'll see.As usual, however, I appreciate everything you all have done for me so far. More than you all will ever know. <3 Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. I definitely feel a bit more loved this week than last. :)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2/12/16 – New Stretch Goal PERK Added! A new perk. For $40 you can now order a SIGNED copy of Lyrical Tales: Collected Poems and Photography, by Jennifer Word. The poetry and art book just released today (2/12/16), and you can have it signed and delivered to your doorstep. (only ships to United States and Canada).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2/11/16STRETCH GOAL!!!!! After only TWO DAYS, it's already time for me to add a stretch goal of $1,500 to reach in the next twelve days!! (and I've already messaged my Atchison, KS Realtor to move forward on the BID for the house I've been looking at!!). The stretch goal could go towards helping me fund the extra costs of the actual move, on top of the 1% down and closing fees for the house. I mean, I will need to stop at motels along the way on my drive with my cats from Salem, OR to Atchison, KS. The drive will take at least 3-4 days, plus motels, gas, and food costs. So, adding a stretch goal of another $500 is probably a smart thing to do, to make this miracle happenstance go as smoothly and stress-free (yeah, right) as possible. But whether we make the stretch goal or not, I'm making a bid on the house. If this happens, it will literally change my whole life for the better. <3-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2/09/16This
 is not easy for me. I don't like ""begging"" for money. And I'm not 
looking for a handout. Just to get all of that out of the way up front.As
 many of you know, I have been battling Lyme Disease for over five years
 now. I didn't even get diagnosed properly (didn't even know it was Lyme
 Disease that I had) until October 20, 2014, a little less than a 
year-and-a-half ago. I have been on oral antibiotics EVER SINCE. And it 
has helped to improve a few of my symptoms a tiny bit, but not all that 
much. I'm still severely disabled, 150 pounds overweight (I was a size 6
 before the infamous ""tick bite""), now I am a size 3X (utterly 
humiliating), and I still suffer from severe edema if I remain in an 
upright position for more than about 2-3 hours in any given 24 hour 
period of time. In other words, to avoid a potential STROKE, I must 
remain horizontal, lying down either in my bed or on my couch for most 
of each day. This has been the only thing to even remotely reduce my 
high blood pressure.As some of you perhaps don't know, 
this is also the very reason I have been given roughly TEN more years to
 live. Given my physical state, without any stronger treatment for my 
disease, and barring divine intervention, if I remain on oral 
antibiotics alone, this disease will progress, and not even being 
bedridden will save me from the inevitable stroke and/or heart attack 
that will undoubtedly kill me. Barring those two outcomes, the high 
level of pain killers I take nearly every day to make the full bodied 
rheumatoid arthritis that I also suffer from as a direct result of Lyme 
Disease bearable, will eventually take its toll on my internal organs 
(most notably my pancreas and liver) and this will in turn cause even 
more pain, more meds internally ingested and eventually multiple organ 
failure. If I don't have a stroke or heart attack first, I can look 
forward to developing pancreatitis (painful and incurable), liver 
cirrhosis, and/or kidney failure.And all of this will 
happen if my disease remains on its current course. I have been on oral 
antibiotics every day now for fourteen months, and still spend most of 
my days in a lot of pain, and lying down. I do all my work for EMP 
Publishing on my couch, in my home. I'm doing the best I can in the 
situation I have found myself in. And one small grace, in trying to find
 something to do to fill my days (rather than just stare at the TV and 
vegetate) is that in founding my publishing company (originally simply 
to publish all of my OWN writing before I die), I've discovered that I'm
 actually pretty darn good at it. My books look beautiful (who knew I 
had a knack for interior layout design?), and I work very well with 
other authors (I never considered myself a ""people person"" before!). So,
 I now have a publishing company on a fast track to actually being 
successful, i.e. this could end up being my full time job and career 
(that I LOVE!), and I am able to work from home. What I can't do is 
actually go for a walk for basic exercise. The exact and varying 
symptoms of my chronic disease would take forever to explain.In
 the past, as many of you again (perhaps) know, I have run fundraisers 
to try and raise tens of thousands of dollars for help in treating my 
Lyme Disease, and also in the past to raise money to fund my own 
personal publishing projects (my life's work before I die). This was 
simply too much. It is too much. I cannot ask for or expect my community
 of friends, family and peers to donate $10K for the basic round of 
infusion treatment (it's the exact same as Chemo, only with high potency
 liquid antibiotics, straight into a port installed in my heart) I need 
to have done, in order to kick my Chronic Lyme Disease into remission 
(at the advanced stage of my disease, remission is the outcome, not a 
""cure""). I may need to have a round of infusion treatment again 3-5 
years down the road, but it's a much more effective treatment than the 
ineffective antibiotic pills I swallow down 3 times a day that only slow
 my body's degeneration. There's no hope of recovering any real quality 
of life without the more aggressive infusion treatment.But
 it's too much to ask for that. A round of antibiotic infusion treatment
 (2-3 times a week for 8-12 weeks), at an outpatient infusion lab (they 
are found in every single state in our country) would run a cool $10K. I
 am not asking for that. But I have been praying to God (these are 
simply my own personal religious beliefs) and I believe He has shown me a
 way to rebuild my life.Where there is a will, there is a
 way. As they say, right? I work from home. And I have an independent 
income of alimony (and child support) from my unfortunate divorce. 
Without that monthly support, I would be living with family members and 
burdening them, so I am very grateful (not for the divorce, obviously, 
but) for the fact that I do have a monthly ""income"", especially in light
 of my inability to work a job outside the home in my current physical 
condition.But I have EMP Publishing. And it's going very 
well. I hope to build my company up to at the very least be a 
supplemental income for me for when I do return to work (with the Grace 
of God) and am finally able, once again, to go outside my home and earn 
money at a job. But my current situation lends itself perfectly to being
 nomadic, if you will. I can go anywhere in the country and still run 
EMP Publishing. I can go anywhere in the country and still retain the 
25% custody of my two teenagers that I now have. I moved to Oregon, not 
by choice, but out of financial necessity. I'm not getting any better, 
physically, and remaining in Southern California was simply not working.But
 as I've said, I believe God has shown me a way. On a lark, I applied 
for a home loan. (Lark meaning, I randomly clicked on the ""get 
pre-approved"" button on Zillow one afternoon while daydreaming). With my
 current credit score lower due to the large amount of medical debt I've
 taken on over the last several years, and my savings GONE, I never 
thought a house could possibly be in my future. My life changed roughly 8
 weeks ago (early December) when I was pre-approved for a home loan with
 Quicken, under their new Rocket program (did anyone see that awesome 
commercial during the Superbowl?!, I started screaming, ""That's MY 
loan!!""). But I wasn't approved for a whole lot, considering my 
finances. $75K. That's what I was granted. On pre-approval. Of course, I
 looked in Oregon first. And there's nothing. Nothing that cheap. And in
 livable condition. The Rocket loan program states the house must be 
100% ""turnkey"" condition, i.e., ready to move into and live freely. No 
""as-is"", no ""fixer upper"", not ""This house just needs a little TLC"". 
Turnkey. And under $75K.That's harder to find that you 
might think. I began scouring the entire COUNTRY eight weeks ago, 
desperately trying to find a house under $75K that is turnkey. Because, 
given the right situation, all other expenses considered equal (the 
utilities for the area, the cost of winter heating or summer cooling, 
etc.) a mortgage on a house at $75K or under, versus what I'm currently 
paying for my rent here in Salem, OR (which is already 50% cheaper than 
where I just moved from outside of L.A.) would mean an extra $500/month 
of leftover income for me to use.And THAT will get me the
 $10K I need to raise to pay for my OWN infusion treatment to kick my 
Lyme Disease into remission. The keys to the kingdom for me, lie in 
raising the money for the house I have found, after scouring the entire 
country. I settled on KANSAS. The Midwest, as it turns out, is the most 
affordable place in the United States. Right smack-dab in the middle of 
the country. I found the perfect little town (only 30 minutes outside of
 Kansas City, KS, the LARGEST city in the state), Lyme Specialists to 
choose from in all directions and within less than 45 minutes drive (and
 more importantly INFUSION labs), and I can even hit bordering states of
 Nebraska, Oklahoma and Missouri if needs be (but everything I'd need 
medically is right there in KC). A cute little town called Atchison 
(those of you who REALLY know me will know I love this: Atchison is 
billed as the ""most haunted town in Kansas""!!). Population just under 
11,000. And the perfect little, one story, 1388 square foot 
home with a very nice (and DRY) basement, for $45K. And a Rocket Loan from
 Quicken requiring only 1% down. So, I need to raise roughly $450 for 
the initial 1% down payment. Then I need (estimated, I mean, I've never 
bought a home before, and I'm flippin' 40-years-old here) another 
roughly $450 or so for all the random ""closing costs"" upon purchasing 
the home and actually paying taxes and transfer title fees, etc. And I 
need an additional $325 (my Realtor has told me THIS exact amount for 
certain) for the home's appraisal/inspection. I want to make certain 
before putting in a final bid that I'm not buying something that ""looks""
 great, but has hidden mold in the walls, or termite damage, or sits on 
land emitting ridiculously  high levels of Radon, for whatever reason, 
or that the walls aren't covered in LEAD paint, etc.), so YES I'm having
 an inspection done. So:$450$450$325Comes
 to a grand total of $1,225. However, I have a very wonderful and 
incredible friend who has already offered to give me $500 to help me 
make this happen, so minus that $500, I need roughly $725. I have 
rounded back up to $1000 to help me cover the cost of hiring movers to 
move all my things from my current apartment here in Salem, OR, into a 
storage unit. I'd be driving myself and a few belongings (plus my two 
cats) halfway across the country to move into this little house in 
Atchison, KS, and leaving my things behind (most of which I plan to sell
 or donate to Goodwill anyhow, so my storage unit will be smaller and 
hopefully minimal cost). Even factoring a storage unit of roughly 
$100/mo into the equation, if I can get this house in Atchison and begin
 paying the mortgage on a $45K home, I will be looking at a monthly 
savings of over $500/month. (ALL other things considered, I've already 
researched the cost of all utilities, groceries, gas, etc. and it's 
actually another 10% cheaper than here in Salem), which I then plan to 
use to pay off my medical debt (another huge stress that doesn't help my
 physical or emotional health) while simultaneously saving up the $10K I
 need to pay for my OWN infusion treatment.So, no more 
fundraisers or ""begging"" for money ever again. And certainly not even 
this time around, for tens of thousands of dollars. I need to raise 
roughly $1000. That's it. After that, I truly believe I can create a 
life for myself where I take over, save the money myself, and pay for my
 own medical treatment, no more having to ask anyone for money for 
anything EVER again.So, this one last time, I'm telling 
myself. And not for a whole lot. Not for some crazy amount of money that
 I cannot expect anyone to be able to donate for me. And this way, I am 
enabled to help myself. With just one small step of raising the lesser 
amount of $1000, I can then take control of my finances, my life, my 
Lyme Disease treatment and management, etc.What would YOU
 be able to do with an extra $500 every month just suddenly handed to 
you? If I can raise the money needed to buy this house and move to 
Atchison, KS, it opens the door, it creates the way, the path, towards 
rebuilding my life. No more begging after this.So, I am 
not trying to look for a handout here. To risk sounding cheesy, I'm 
looking for one last ""hand UP"". And then I can take it from there. And 
this WILL change my entire life. This will make a life and a future for 
myself possible. This will give me hope. This would erase that 'TEN 
YEAR' death sentence of not expecting to live beyond age 50, because I'd
 have the hope (and it WILL happen) of getting infusion treatment within
 a year to a year-and-a-half after moving into a financial situation 
where I suddenly have an extra $500 per month to put towards my medical 
goals of treatment. I want to save that $10K myself. And I CAN do it, if
 I can just come up with $1000. And I don't want to lose this perfect 
house (turnkey, in a haunted town, only $45K), I want to be the one to 
bid on it, before someone else takes it off the market. I want to be 
able to bid on that house before the end of February.So, 
this is a fundraiser. And it's ""Operation: Save Jen"". I'm not trying to 
be overly dramatic here, but this could literally change my entire life 
for the better...and eventually and actually prolong my life back to a 
more normal lifespan expectancy.Also, once I'm in the 
home, the loan and mortgage set in place, I have further been 
pre-approved for a business loan from Wells Fargo (my bank) for $5-$10K 
to help me run EMP Publishing for the next few years without it costing 
ME anymore out of my personal and monthly budget. So, despite the new 
monthly installment to pay off said business loan, that would actually 
INCREASE my monthly budget again by another $200 per month or more.I'm
 looking at a DREAM life, with health, longevity, a HOUSE (another dream
 of mine, which is why I was even on stupid Zillow to begin with, 
drooling, lol), the perfect town for me (come on, if you KNOW me, then 
moving to the ""most haunted town"" in any state is SO Jen, lol), I was 
born two days before Halloween, and I LOVE spooky things. I mean, come 
on, EMP's main ""thing"" is an extreme horror quarterly publication! (this
 house I want isn't haunted, though, it was built in 1977, lol). It's 
not haunted...I checked. ;)So...it's a fundraiser. I'm 
asking for money. From whoever wants to donate, and for however much you
 can spare or afford. And as soon as possible, so I can BID on that 
house and get it, and set in motion my move there (to Kansas, of all 
places, lol), and begin saving myself for everything else I need. I'm 
not offering perks, really. Although, I supposed I could put a few up 
where I simply offer to send paperback copies of books that EMP 
Publishing puts out over the next year, if that makes some people feel 
more ""okay"" with this, rather than just simply ""donating"".Otherwise,
 aside from those few perks, this is a straight up fundraiser asking for
 donations. It's the only thing I know to do at this point. I've tried 
raising the funds with taking on extraneous editing projects on the 
side, but it hasn't been nearly enough. I tried to WORK to raise the 
money, as best as I could. I did try. And I asked close friends, but no 
one has the means (it's hard for everyone right now), except for one 
friend of mine, and as I've said, they are funding me with $500. But I 
still need that tiny bit more. And then I'll be in a situation where I 
can FINALLY help myself.If you've made it this far, I 
apologize for writing a book, but I'm not very good at explaining this 
whole situation in under 1000 words...it's a complicated situation, and 
if you don't already know any of this, well...this long story explains 
everything.Any amount will help. And I've still got a few
 more things to try and sell on Craigslist. I'm trying to make this 
happen as much on my own as I can. My own family doesn't have the means 
to help, but maybe if enough of my friends and peers on FB and Twitter, 
etc., come together, we can all make this happen for me. Whoever cares 
to, anyhow, and has the means.We've all read these types 
of statements, ""If you gave just $1""....or ""If everyone gave just $3 
right now..."" yada-yada. Well, it's true...if every single one of my 
friends on FB literally gave $1, I'd have more than triple what I need 
to build my life. So, I only need one third or less of you guys to give 
$1 (not too much of a hardship, right?), or even just 5% of you to give 
$5, and I could build up my life and make all this happen.Or you can order your book perks package from EMP Publishing, lol.Now,
 I'm not putting up a video. I know they help. But I'm still too ashamed
 of how ugly and gross I look, going from 138 pounds to 275. I'm not 
putting myself on video again. That was too hard, and too humiliating. 
And I'd rather have people think of me and remember how I used to look. 
Because maybe, if I can get that treatment and get better, I can hope 
(as vain as it is to do so) to look a bit more attractive again someday.
 More like the old me now trapped inside my new, sick body. :( So, no 
video, folks, sorry.And that's that. Give if you can or 
want. Judge me harshly, call me a beggar. Be disappointed in me. Tell me
 I'm a loser. Or just support me this one last time and give from the 
goodness of your heart. I've gotten every reaction across the board 
already. I've grown a thick skin. I can take it.Thank you
 all (those of you who bothered to take the time to read this whole 
ridiculous thing). I appreciate that. And I appreciate you. I personally
 believe God is overseeing this whole thing. Why He's doing it this way,
 I don't understand. But I'm going to trust it. Whatever your own 
personal religious beliefs are...whether you believe in God or not, or a
 different God than mine (I never said who my ""He"" was...) if you feel 
anything (a small whisper in your ear or your mind) urging you to help. 
Don't ignore it. I think magic is happening here. And I want to get 
better, tell this stupid Lyme Disease to get the f*ck out of my body and
 my life, reclaim my future and my dreams, continue running and building
 up my career and my publishing company, and take my LIFE back, and I 
want to do it in a haunted town in Kansas, darnit!!!Thank you.Sincerely,Jen Word",1.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>What Is Sounds and Colours?</h3>
<p>At <a href=""http://www.soundsandcolours.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sounds and Colours</a> we have made it our mission to find the most interesting stories, influential artists, innovative individuals and illuminating cultural practices happening in South America. This is set to continue with <b><i>Sounds and Colours Argentina</i></b>, our fourth publication and one that will focus strictly on the immense music and culture of Argentina.</p>
<p>Sounds and Colours has been around since 2010 in the shape of a website (<a href=""http://www.soundsandcolours.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.soundsandcolours.com</a>) that regularly publishes articles, news and special multimedia features focused on South American music and culture. In 2012 we grew to become a publisher with the release of <i><a href=""http://soundsandcolours.com/issues/sounds-and-colours-colombia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sounds and Colours Colombia</a></i>, followed by <i><a href=""http://soundsandcolours.com/issues/sounds-and-colours-brazil/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sounds and Colours Brazil</a></i> in 2013 and <i><a href=""http://soundsandcolours.com/issues/sounds-and-colours-peru/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sounds and Colours Peru</a></i> in 2015.</p>
<p>Contributors to the Argentina book include regular contributors to the Sounds and Colours website as well as specially-selected individuals from Argentina and the rest of the world who we feel can offer a valuable and interesting insight into Argentine culture. Here are our current list of contributors:</p>
<p>Pablo Bobadilla, Tim Castor, Alan Chac, Alan Courtis, Juan Data, Sarah Foster, Adam Fry, Ezequiel Garcia, Amaya Garcia-Velasco, Diane Ghogomu, Ellen Gordon, Claire Green, Miguel Grinberg.

<h3>When Will Sounds and Colours Argentina Be Released?</h3>
<p>We are aiming for the print edition of <i>Sounds and Colours Argentina</i> to be ready by August, at which time we will send the book to all of our funders. The book will then be made available to the general public in September. The digital edition of <i>Sounds and Colours Argentina</i> will be ready in September. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Any changes to this schedule will be mentioned in our Project Updates.</span></p>
<h3>Why Get Involved?</h3>
<p>Get involved because you love Argentine or because you want to know more about Argentina, or because you want to help out an independent publisher as they find their way in the world. Sounds and Colours is undoubtedly a niche publication but it's one that inspires a lot of passion and enthusiasm – as nobody else does what we do. Since we began in 2010 we have made no profit. We're happy to continue that way, though we would love to grow and do even more research into South American culture. You can be sure that if you contribute to this campaign your money will not be going into grubby hands or be wasted. We do what we do because we love doing it, and any money we make will go into doing that as best as we can. Plus, we need to cover all the costs of printing this thing!</p>

</div></div>","A guidebook to Argentina's glorious culture, looking beyond the stereotypes to discover the real Argentina.After much deliberation we are back to announce the fourth publication in our Latin American culture series. For our latest project we have set our sights on Argentina; its music, film, literature, art, theatre, architecture, comic books, underground movements and everything else that fills its cultural calendar.Sounds and Colours Argentina will be a 200-page book filled with articles, illustrations and photos produced by an extended team of experts, academics, cultural fanatics, artists, musicians and devotees. By focusing on a wide range of topics and using a vast array of points of views we aim to show a true panorama of Argentine culture, looking at the cultural icons of yore as well as the new artists and areas where creativity and integrity are colliding in interesting ways.The book will come accompanied with a specially-curated selection of new music from Argentina, titled The New Sounds of Argentina.The book will also be released as a digital book and the compilation will be made available digitally as a stand-alone download.Illustration by Ezequiel Garcia What Will Be In The Book?Here are some of the articles that we've already confirmed for the book.

You will not find a single advert in any of our publications. This is the way we like it. It allows us to be completely objective in deciding what content to feature and gives us full creative control.However, this attitude does bring with it some problems. Namely, a lack of money. For this reason we are using Indiegogo to raise £1,300 ($1,870) for the initial costs of making the book (cover design, artwork, editing, translating) and of printing 300 copies. By buying in advance, you are ensuring that this project can go ahead and letting us know of the demand out there. If we make more than our target then any additional money will be spent on printing more books and/or commissioning additional content, such as original illustrations.What You GetChoose to buy Sounds and Colours Argentina as either a digital or print publication and get one of our amazing perks, including the last chance to get hold of some of our older editions.Digital – Sounds and Colours Argentina will be released as a digital book, available in Kindle and PDF formats. The music compilation will also be released digitally and available in a number of formats.Print – The print version of Sounds and Colours Argentina will be available in English and will feature 200 pages of articles, illustrations and photos alongside a CD of new Argentine music.Perks – if you'd like a little something extra then why not get a giclée print of an exclusive design by one of our favourite illustrators, Lee Hodges, especially for the book or one of our postcard sets, featuring images from all four of our publications. It's the perfect gift for anyone who loves Latin American culture.Exclusive Mixtape – as an extra addition all of our backers will receive an exclusive mixtape of new Argentine music from Doma Tornados.The PerksChoose from one of our amazing perks!- A giclée print of a brand new design made by Lee Hodges especially for the book.

Pero su nuevo hogar no lo es todo para que la joven consiga tapar el enorme hueco que los fallecimientos de su hermana y su madre, unos años atrás, dejaron en su alma.<br/>            Además, se siente constantemente acosada por una siniestra presencia que la sigue allá donde va. Una presencia que, en el pasado, fue una pequeña llamada Ana María, que murió en extrañas circunstancias en la misma casa, setenta años atrás.<br/>            En un lugar de leyendas, magia negra, muerte, secretos ocultos y presencias que anhelan volver a la vida, Yanira se enfrentará a sus mayores temores y descubrirá por primera vez, el amor más poderoso de todos.</p>

Con el terror reflejado en sus ojos, Yanira vio que esa figura era la que había visto atravesar  la pared de la cocina. La figura observaba ensimismada el giro que realizaba la bailarina de la caja y al cabo de unos minutos, levantó la cabeza. Instintivamente, Yanira dio unos pasos atrás y trastabilleó, por lo que no alcanzó a ver el rostro de aquella figura que parecía que la observaba mientras lentamente empezaba a descender los peldaños de la escalera.<br/>          Yanira intentó gritar, pero su grito quedó ahogado en su garganta. Por un momento se quedó allí plantada, viendo cómo la figura se aproximaba a ella con cautela sin dejar de sostener la caja de música. Cuando fue capaz de reaccionar, Yanira se levantó torpemente y echó a correr en dirección a su casa. No se detuvo hasta que abrió la valla que velaba la entrada al interior del huerto. Observó la cocina antes de desaparecer tras la puerta de entrada. Una vez dentro de la casa, se apoyó contra la puerta y trató de calmarse.<br/>          Notó que un sudor frío le cubría el rostro y que temblaba ligeramente por el susto. Miró sus manos, y éstas temblaban al igual que toda ella. Un haz de luz volvió a sobresaltarla y vio que provenía del salón: no estaba sola en casa.

Was the GameStop saga in 2021 the beginning of a new trend or a one-time occurrence? What is the unique role that Reddit will play in the future of equity markets?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the unique impact that Reddit and retail investors will have on financial markets and the future of investing. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the rise of Main Street investors and the impact they are having on Wall Street and large hedge funds. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you think about the new trends in equity markets and what that means for your own financial and investment decisions.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the unique role Reddit plays in the social media landscape and what you can expect can change after a whirlwind of new investment dynamics that have emerged in 2021. You'll hear stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>How a unique social media community called WallStreetBets took on the largest hedge funds on Wall Street... and squeezed them</li>
<li>The rise of individual investors during the COVID-19 pandemic... and their unique use of memes and humor to share investment strategies</li>
<li>How public companies on the brink of failure have leveraged the risk appetite of retail investors to fund growth... and who has come out on top</li>
</ul><p>You will definitely love this book if you are one of the 10 million members of the WallStreetBets sub-reddit or if you are passionate about the impact of social media on our society. You will also love this book if you are a retail investor on the fence of going deeper into equity markets, if you are an institutional investor looking to further understand the dynamics of new social media trends, if you are a policymaker trying to make sense of the new world where regulations are playing catch up with markets, if you are a finance manager outside the US looking to understand the new trends that may emerge in your own markets, or if you are a passionate follower of financial news.<br/><br/><i>Memestock Alpha Degenerates: How Reddit is changing WallStreet</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to individual investors and leaders in business who want to look at the bigger picture of how social media can transform an industry in a short period of time and how adapting quickly in an evolving landscape creates huge risks and rewards.<br/> </p><p><strong>The Book - Memestock Alpha Degenerates: How Reddit is changing Wall Street</strong></p><p><br/>The book is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. The reader will learn about Reddit, its quirks and how it changed the retail investment landscape. The reader will also learn about the history of GameStop, the public company that was part of a short squeeze in January of 2021 that raised the impact of individual investors to worldwide attention. This part of the book argues that Reddit is different and its impact on finance therefore should be understood through a unique lens. My research answers questions such as: Was the GameStop frenzy the wisdom of the crowd or the madness of a mob? The dynamic between individual investors on the Robinhood trading platform and hedge funds was closely examined by Congress: what does that mean for the future of investment regulations? Did the memestock mania create a new type of market dynamic? What does that mean for Wall Street?<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 5-6 and the conclusion. The main thing I examine in this part is whether things in Wall Street truly changed or not. I also look at some of the emerging trends in the investment landscape and propose a few ideas of what those changes will mean in the years to come. I am very passionate about this topic because I believe we are only beginning to see the long-lasting impact the last 10 months will have on the next 10 years.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Did something fundamental change in Wall Street or is this a temporary blip in financial history?

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet Chickpea!</h3>
<p>Chickpea is a black and white cow who grows up inside a big farm. Chickpea watches her fellow bovines disappear one by one, including her own mom. One day all the cows at the farm including Chickpea are led towards a truck, which they sense leads to a terrible place. Making a split-second decision, Chickpea takes a brave leap and goes flying over the fence that encloses the farm. This escape leads her into the woods and, thanks to chance encounters and some delicious vegan pie, into the lives of some new friends, human and nonhuman, who welcome her with kindness.</p>

<p>The narrative is inspired by many real-life cases of runaway cows. Some of their stories can be found on the <i>Chickpea Runs Away</i> website at <a href=""https://chickpearunsaway.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://chickpearunsaway.com</a>.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About the author</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sarat Colling and I’m the author of <i>Chickpea Runs Away</i>. Since completing my master’s in sociology in 2012, which focused on the lives of farmed animals who escape captivity, I have been dedicated to writing about animal resistance. As a vegan of 14 years, I value the lives and voices of all animals who, just like <i>Chickpea</i>, have a story to tell.</p>
<p>It has been delightful to work on this project with the talented children’s book illustrator and pet portrait artist, Vicky Bowes, who brought Chickpea’s story to life with her magical illustrations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What makes this book important</h3>
<p>While billions of animals are captive in human society, every day some of them manage to break free: escaping past gates, fences and trailers, and running through the streets, fields, and forests. Such defiant acts are one form of animal resistance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540065431/uvur9prlhutvzohqaxb6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Chickpea Runs Away</i> depicts both daily acts of animal resistance and escape. Based on true stories, this book offers children an engaging narrative through the lens of animals’ resistance and agency. It’s a potent angle from which to consider animals' perspectives and imagine what it would be like to be an outlaw cow on the run and in the forest.</p>
<p>The story also demonstrates ways that supportive individuals can act in solidarity with animal resistors. The characters Chickpea meets after her escape help with her basic needs, offer her a loving home, and aid her without taking away her autonomy.  </p>

About the author
Hi, my name is Sarat Colling and I’m the author of Chickpea Runs Away.

As a vegan of 14 years, I value the lives and voices of all animals who, just like Chickpea, have a story to tell.
It has been delightful to work on this project with the talented children’s book illustrator and pet portrait artist, Vicky Bowes, who brought Chickpea’s story to life with her magical illustrations.

What makes this book important
While billions of animals are captive in human society, every day some of them manage to break free: escaping past gates, fences and trailers, and running through the streets, fields, and forests. Such defiant acts are one form of animal resistance.

Chickpea Runs Away depicts both daily acts of animal resistance and escape. Based on true stories, this book offers children an engaging narrative through the lens of animals’ resistance and agency. It’s a potent angle from which to consider animals' perspectives and imagine what it would be like to be an outlaw cow on the run and in the forest.
The story also demonstrates ways that supportive individuals can act in solidarity with animal resistors. The characters Chickpea meets after her escape help with her basic needs, offer her a loving home, and aid her without taking away her autonomy.

When will I get my book?
The books will be delivered in approximately three months from the end of the campaign. 

May Chickpea’s story inspire kids to contemplate the courage within themselves, as well as the meaningful lives of other animals. Thank you for your support!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What's What...</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Kevin Patterson and I'm blogger behind Poly Role Models and the author of Love's Not Color Blind: Race and Representation in Polyamorous and Other Alternative Communities. I've been speaking and writing about representation and polyamory for going on 5 years. I've been consuming comics and sci-fi for my whole life. About halfway into writing Love's Not Color Blind, I took a break for NaNoWriMo to write a story I didn't think I'd share to anyone but my friends.  Friends like Alana Phelan, The Polyamorous Librarian, an educator, editor, and book reviewer also local to the Philadelphia area.</p>
<p>By our powers combined, we two polyamorous Wonder Twins have kicked off a queer and polyamorous superheroic world with this book, For Hire: Operator.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to cover the cost of publishing and marketing For Hire: Operator. Though our advocacy work offers us a little bit of a platform, it isn't nearly enough to clear the hurdle of getting a book into all of the hands.</p>
<p>What we're looking to cover is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing costs</li>
<li>Shipping supplies and postage</li>
<li>Artwork (credit to <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/mrmiguelblanco/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Miguel Blanco</i></a>)</li>
<li>Marketing materials (stickers, trailers, etc.)</li>
<li>A little financial breathing room to not take on new projects until this one is finished</li>
</ul>
<p>What we're looking to give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early copies of the ebooks</li>
<li>Signed copies of the paperback</li>
<li>Acknowledgements in the book itself</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are nerds and we want to see ourselves represented in characters in a way we can't casually do...yet. We hope to one day see hundreds of books like ours, but until then we will keep writing our diverse world so that others can be reflected in our pages.</p>

The Impact
We are nerds and we want to see ourselves represented in characters in a way we can't casually do...yet. We hope to one day see hundreds of books like ours, but until then we will keep writing our diverse world so that others can be reflected in our pages.

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>In my day-to-day life, I work in higher education in central New York, but in my free time I like to create stories and paper crafts as gifts for friends and local art festivals. Recently, I created an experience that I as able to share with attendees at an event and it got great reviews. After that beta-test, I was ready to bring it to a larger audience. In the future, I will likely continue to make individual experiences tailored to one recipient, but I may make more larger stories. It's a mystery!</p>
</div><div>
<div>
<h3>What did people think of the experience?</h3>
<p>The experience was beta tested for ease of readability and general ""fun"" measuring. Here is what participants had to say:</p>
<p><i>""A haunting and creepy experience."" - Angela S.</i></p>
<p><i>""You start by assuming you're in control of the experience, but rather quickly see that you're not. This piece struck amazing balance, forcing you to pause and think about subtle dynamics while also pushing you to find out what happens next. I'm still thinking about it a week later."" - Dominique D.</i></p>
<p><i>""I was really pleased to be </i>[REDACTED]<i> in this activity. The materials in this activity were beautifully made and the story takes a fun surprise twist at the end!"" - Isaac R.</i></p>
<p><i>""Building the story</i><br/><i>Of Sound of Insanity--</i><br/><i>Horrifying fun!""</i><br/><i>- Amanda S.</i></p>
<p><i>""The bells! The bells!"" - Ann O.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The supplies, shipping, and time to create the items are the bulk of the costs here. The story also has over one hundred hours of creation and testing. For a little extra, you can help craft the story by naming a character after yourself or honoring someone else. There is also an option to have fancy hand-addressed calligraphy envelopes. Regardless of whether I sell all of the experiences available, every purchase will get the experience when it is ready and every backer can customize an artifact in the initial mailing.</p>
<p>The experience itself is currently comprised of four mailings of various sizes with more than a dozen hand-crafted items ranging from newspaper clippings to telegraphs to emails - spanning multiple time periods.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A story told over time through interactive objects is a unique experience that most people have never had before. Recipients of my stories in the past have been surprised by the intricacy and attention to detail that each piece shows. Here is one example from this past holiday season:</p>

<p><i>""Just received the most intricate, interesting Christmas gift. It's like an escape room in a box and I'm obsessed."" - Dani N.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are not many risks or challenges involved. Most of the materials are already purchased and the design for the artifacts are already created and just need to be modified with custom information. The two things that are funding dependent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any ""name a character"" levels leftover at the end will be filled in by myself with people I know and love (unless they die in the story, then I will pick someone else...).</li>
<li>One artifact is cheaper for me the more I buy, but that doesn't affect you ;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Happens to the Proceeds?</h3>
<p>The materials are purchased, so where does the money go? Glad you asked. First, I need to pay myself back for the supplies, the time creating, and the testing process. Then of course Indiegogo has some fees. I also want to donate a portion of the proceeds to POrtalBurn, a regional event that gave me a grant to create the prototype to be beta tested. The rest will go towards a leadership training certification I have wanted to do for a while and also a medical bill that has been haunting me for a few years. There is no plan to launch a new business or anything like that, just trying out a creative way to share my art and pay some bills.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sound too complicated or weird? Not into light horror themes? Don't know anyone to gift it to? Hate fun? No problem! You can support by sharing the campaign with friends who might enjoy it. There are some share tools located at the top to make it easier!</p>
<h3>What, no Stretch Goals?</h3>
<p>Oh alright, fine. If I reach the funding goal, I will also include an epilogue of sorts in the form of an expertly designed crossword puzzle that incorporates the story elements and multiple puzzle elements (in case crosswords weren't hard enough!).</p>

<p>When I was 20 years old I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  It felt like the end of my life. Back then I didn't know anyone with such diagnosis who would lead a fulfilling life and there was generally speaking  little  or no information on how to heal from that existential condition. Only how to stay reasonably stable with the help of medication. The perspective of staying sedated my whole life didn't appeal to me. Psychiatric treatment felt impersonal, unhelpful  and cold. I wasn't progressing but becoming more withdrawn and self-stigmatizing with each month of it. </p>
<p>Afer many years of searching for alternatives I found out that what I needed the most was to have people around me who would understand my story. Professionals couldn't do that for me.  People with lived experience did. And the wisdom and acceptance they gave me slowly started to heal me and make me stronger...</p>
<p>I am in a different place now and I know there is healing. I also know that psychiatry is far too pessimistic in its prognosis for people with what it call serious mental disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The psychodelic journey from space to Earth is not all about suffering and loss.  It provides the one who undergoes this path with rich experiences, deep understanding of humanity, compassion and awareness of the self as well as unique individuality.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, after years of my healing process and feeling closer to being whole, fulfilled and strong I feel the need to share with others what I have learnt along the way.</p>
<p>In my book I present a couple of useful truths about the existential condition of being a highly sensitive individual lost in the World. These truths have saved me and I believe they have the  power to help one integrate and emerge from chaos and suffering.</p>
<p>With your help I will be able to share my knowledge with others.</p>
<p>There are too many of us going through experiences of emotional/spiritual crisis alone. Too many of us not knowing there are other weird creatures from the tribe out there waiting to give us a hand.</p>
<p>With your help I'll do my part in breaking the stigma.</p>

<p>Here's what a specialist in treating psychosis dr. Danielle Knafo wrote about this book:</p>
<p><i>''The Heavy Volume of Aliens is a wonderful and heartfelt book that embraces difference. Author Anna Lipska writes from experience. She herself has been diagnosed with bipolar illness with psychotic features. She was treated according to the medical model with pharmaceuticals and told she had a lifelong condition. Ms. Lipska eventually had the courage to question diagnostic labeling and drug treatment. Instead of living her life as a patient, she embarked on an inner journey that embraced her difference while it also helped to anchor her in reality. This book is a guide for the many others who live life on earth feeling like aliens. It is very comprehensive and covers areas that are glaringly absent from medical texts: spirituality, creativity, self-care, relationships. Healing comes in many forms and Ms. Lipska empathically writes of the pain people feel and the challenges they confront. Most importantly, she gives hope and direction toward the acceptance of difference and channeling of the universal instinct for recognition and belonging. I recommend this book to anyone who feels he or she does not belong in this world. They will be pleasantly surprised with an alternative perspective that can guide them toward integration and peace of mind.''</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started this project after seeing a couple different fandom artbooks go through with great success, both of which were met with much love and support from the Supernatural community. Seeing how much care went into them and how much attention they garnered, I couldn't help but wonder- ""what if a similar project existed to celebrate the writers in fandom?""</p>
<p>""Seasons"" is a project that's meant to do exactly that- celebrate those authors and give them a bit of a spotlight. Fan fiction is an often underappreciated medium, so I wanted to give it some of the love and attention that it deserves. If this project goes according to plan, then it'll finally get at least a bit of that recognition.</p>
<p>On top of that, I'm hoping we'll get to raise some funds for two very worthy causes- all profits raised for this project beyond production costs will be split evenly between the Archive of Our Own (better known as AO3) and the IMAlive crisis support network. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After looking at different costs, here's where we're at in terms of the money we need to see this project through. The $4000 goal I've set pays for...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Printing</strong>: 100 softcover books and 100 hardcover books, to start with</li>
<li>
<strong>Commissions</strong>: cover art, etc.</li>
<li><strong>eBook conversion cost</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Profit margin</strong>: to be donated to AO3 + IMAlive</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds raised past the goal will go to printing of additional books (however many are needed based on demand, plus possibly a few extra copies for post-campaign sales), and possibly to additional rewards.</p>
<p>As for what you'll be getting out of this project- let's talk a little more about the book itself.</p>
<p>The book will be 6x9"", approximately 400 pages long, and is offered in digital (eBook and PDF), hardcover, and softcover versions. The cover art has been done by <a href=""http://paulamould.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paula Mould</a>, and inside, you'll find ninety original works by ninety different fandom authors, each roughly 1200 words or fewer, gen, and canon-verse. Each work will be in one of four themed chapters- Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter- with the overarching theme of the book (and the title!) being ""Seasons."" Also included in the book will be a complete list of writers, betas, and campaign contributors- that's all of you- who've participated in bringing this project to life.</p>
<p>In addition to the books themselves, we've teamed up with some wonderfully talented fandom artists to create a few extra goodies that are available with different contributions. These include postcard prints (by <a href=""http://sketchydean.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sketchydean</a>), bookmarks (by <a href=""http://impalartsociopath.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">impalartsociopath</a>), and stickers (by <a href=""http://diminuel.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">diminuel</a>).</p>
<p>Several of our authors have also signed up to offer written commissions as a part of the campaign! If you're interesting in having a custom fic written and you'd like to learn more about which authors are participating and how to claim their spots, take a look at <a href=""http://spnshortstories.tumblr.com/commissions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this page</a>. You must send in an email (to spnshortstories@gmail.com) in order to gain access to and claim one of these commissions.</p>
<p>Every individual who contributes to this campaign will be included in the list of contributors in the final book, whether you contribute dollar or one hundred. Your support means the world to us, and we want to show you a little love, too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fan fiction is a medium that's often dismissed by people at large, and its creators don't get much in the way of respect for their talent. This project aims to start mending that, by giving those authors the recognition they deserve. If it's successful, and everything goes according to plan, then Seasons could open the door for more, similar projects in the future- ones with different parameters, attracting different authors and different types of audiences.</p>
<p>We're also working to raise money for two very worthy charity causes- the Archive of Our Own and the IMAlive crisis support network.</p>
<p>For fandom writers, AO3 is an indispensable resource for sharing work. For fic readers, it’s a godsend; extremely easy to navigate and chock-full of everything you could possibly want to read. AO3 is a non-profit organization that relies on donations to run, and with everything it's done for our fandom and more, it definitely deserves to get a little something back from us. </p>
<p>IMAlive is an online crisis network where 100% of the volunteers are trained in crisis intervention. It offers an online alternative to crisis hotlines, where talking over the phone might be too much for an individual to handle. Largely supported by the SPN Family, they’re also present at Creation’s Supernatural conventions and offer support to people who need it. Donations support volunteers and the network itself. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now, the project is in its final stages of being put together. All of the content has been gathered, and now it's just a matter of putting it into the book so everything can be properly formatted. The biggest challenge will be wait time in terms of getting everything printed and shipped out, and I'll be doing everything in my power to make sure it all runs smoothly once the campaign is over.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The biggest way to help out is to spread the word! We want to get as many people interested in this project as possible, so spreading interest on any social media you have is a huge help. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I started this project after seeing a couple different fandom artbooks go through with great success, both of which were met with much love and support from the Supernatural community. Seeing how much care went into them and how much attention they garnered, I couldn't help but wonder- ""what if a similar project existed to celebrate the writers in fandom?""
""Seasons"" is a project that's meant to do exactly that- celebrate those authors and give them a bit of a spotlight. Fan fiction is an often underappreciated medium, so I wanted to give it some of the love and attention that it deserves. If this project goes according to plan, then it'll finally get at least a bit of that recognition.
On top of that, I'm hoping we'll get to raise some funds for two very worthy causes- all profits raised for this project beyond production costs will be split evenly between the Archive of Our Own (better known as AO3) and the IMAlive crisis support network. 

What We Need & What You Get
After looking at different costs, here's where we're at in terms of the money we need to see this project through. The $4000 goal I've set pays for...


Printing: 100 softcover books and 100 hardcover books, to start with

Commissions: cover art, etc.
eBook conversion cost

Profit margin: to be donated to AO3 + IMAlive

Funds raised past the goal will go to printing of additional books (however many are needed based on demand, plus possibly a few extra copies for post-campaign sales), and possibly to additional rewards.
As for what you'll be getting out of this project- let's talk a little more about the book itself.
The book will be 6x9"", approximately 400 pages long, and is offered in digital (eBook and PDF), hardcover, and softcover versions. The cover art has been done by Paula Mould, and inside, you'll find ninety original works by ninety different fandom authors, each roughly 1200 words or fewer, gen, and canon-verse. Each work will be in one of four themed chapters- Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter- with the overarching theme of the book (and the title!) being ""Seasons."" Also included in the book will be a complete list of writers, betas, and campaign contributors- that's all of you- who've participated in bringing this project to life.
In addition to the books themselves, we've teamed up with some wonderfully talented fandom artists to create a few extra goodies that are available with different contributions. These include postcard prints (by sketchydean), bookmarks (by impalartsociopath), and stickers (by diminuel).
Several of our authors have also signed up to offer written commissions as a part of the campaign! If you're interesting in having a custom fic written and you'd like to learn more about which authors are participating and how to claim their spots, take a look at this page. You must send in an email (to spnshortstories@gmail.com) in order to gain access to and claim one of these commissions.
Every individual who contributes to this campaign will be included in the list of contributors in the final book, whether you contribute dollar or one hundred. Your support means the world to us, and we want to show you a little love, too.

The Impact
Fan fiction is a medium that's often dismissed by people at large, and its creators don't get much in the way of respect for their talent. This project aims to start mending that, by giving those authors the recognition they deserve. If it's successful, and everything goes according to plan, then Seasons could open the door for more, similar projects in the future- ones with different parameters, attracting different authors and different types of audiences.
We're also working to raise money for two very worthy charity causes- the Archive of Our Own and the IMAlive crisis support network.
For fandom writers, AO3 is an indispensable resource for sharing work. For fic readers, it’s a godsend; extremely easy to navigate and chock-full of everything you could possibly want to read. AO3 is a non-profit organization that relies on donations to run, and with everything it's done for our fandom and more, it definitely deserves to get a little something back from us. 
IMAlive is an online crisis network where 100% of the volunteers are trained in crisis intervention. It offers an online alternative to crisis hotlines, where talking over the phone might be too much for an individual to handle. Largely supported by the SPN Family, they’re also present at Creation’s Supernatural conventions and offer support to people who need it. Donations support volunteers and the network itself. 

Risks & Challenges
Right now, the project is in its final stages of being put together. All of the content has been gathered, and now it's just a matter of putting it into the book so everything can be properly formatted. The biggest challenge will be wait time in terms of getting everything printed and shipped out, and I'll be doing everything in my power to make sure it all runs smoothly once the campaign is over.

Other Ways You Can Help
The biggest way to help out is to spread the word! We want to get as many people interested in this project as possible, so spreading interest on any social media you have is a huge help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you're reading this you probably already know who I am and what I do but if you're new to me and the unadulterated fiasco that is my life, here's the low-down...</p>
<p>My name is Cate Bolt, people like to call me Aunty Cate or CaBo. I'm just an average middle-aged mum of nine who started an orphanage in Indonesia. My orphanage is primarily funded by me sewing 'cunt' on soft furnishings... and selling pictures of my tits. I live in a Walking Dead themed converted school bus and I drive a hot pink Kombi...it matches my hair. I have a few tattoos and I tend to swear quite a fucking lot. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm not what you'd call your 'average' humanitarian but I have saved lives. I've been to some of the darkest and most fucked up places - both physically and metaphorically. I'm best known, however, as the creator of the 'cunt cushion' that went viral... and the customer service smackdown queen.</p>
<p>For years now people have been asking me to compile all my best ""Messages From People Who Don't Really Like Us Very Much"" and other replies to mouth-breathers in a handy-dandy, take-anywhere compendium - and here it is.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's This Book About?</h3>
<p>As you may or may not know, I'm currently in the process of writing a ""real book"". This book is basically just foreplay... a pre-book book. This book will contain filthy fucking language, fairly frequent references to masturbation, possibly nudity and topics that are best avoided at family gatherings. It's the perfect gift for your kids this Christmas!</p>
<p>Dead Guys Don't Play Trumpet will feature a whole bunch of stuff I've posted on social media over the years, organised into sections on topics like customer service, parenting, depression, being 40+ and single... why I will die alone etc etc. Even though some of the subject matter is ""heavy"" it will overall be a lighthearted and (hopefully) funny read, interspersed with those classic CaBo 'smack in the feels' moments. It will also feature lots of pretty pictures, not only of my tits, and not be a normal paperback style publication... because fuck normal.</p>
<p>I'm still in the concept stage but at this point, I'm aiming for the book to be a bit larger than a standard paperback, and at least 124 pages of partial colour print. If you're familiar with my work at all, you'll know to expect something a little 'different'. I like to make pretty things :D</p>
<p>The book is available in three formats - paperback cover, hardcover with dust jacket and hardcover with imagewrap (no dust jacket).</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div><p>Because I'm self publishing this book I'm just looking to raise enough to print a small run of 100 copies. If I sell more than 100 copies on pre-order then, I'll print more. If I don't sell 100 copies on pre-order, then I won't be printing it at all! If you don't get in on the presale though, don't stress. Assuming we DO go to print, after the initial run you will be able to purchase an unsigned copy direct from the printers.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to order a copy of the book and you'd still like to help out, please feel free to share the campaign on social media and amongst your family, friends, work colleagues or parole officers. </p>
<p>You can also make a contribution without buying the book, if you have some fundamental objection to publishing ... or books in general. I'm not judging you but that's kinda weird. OK, I am judging you. Please buy my book. It will be pretty. </p>
<p>The profits from this book will be split between me and my humanitarian projects. Sometimes I like to eat, and food costs money, unless you steal it and I don't condone illegal activities. </p>

<p>Cheers fkn heaps, guys!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> It's all about the music!  At least for me it is.  Like most Canadians, I am a music lover. Although I've never been an active participant such as a songwriter or musician, I always felt that I have missed out on something in my life by not being an active member of that special community.  Just like a song can trigger certain memories, I found that album covers could do the same.  When I was younger I would could hardly contain my excitement when , after purchasing a new album, I could now admire the artwork, review the liner notes and check out the credits of the band.  Now, in this digital age, it appears that the album cover has become a lost art.  I hope in some small way that I can renew your interest.  I started this project about five years ago as my personal commitment to help support Canadian musicians, and though there have been many times that I thought I would never finish a few kind words from friends and family, and a big shout out and thank you to Alan Cross, who without his support and advice, I likely would never have finished.</p>
<p>          Canadian Alternative &amp; Indie is the first in a series from Rock My World Canada!  I do not profess to be a writer, so let's be clear about that!  The series is designed as a compilation of the history of each musician or band as shown by the studio album releases and a short biography.  This issue contains over 900 musical acts and over 3000 album covers from Canada's famous and not so famous musicians.  It's like going to the record store without going to the record store!  The goal is for you to discover something new as you view the pages, a musical act you might have never heard of, but for some reason that album cover has peaked your interest, and before you know it, you're on the internet checking it out. Alan Cross (The Ongoing History Of New Music, A Journal Of Musical Things) described the book like this: ""If you’re at all into collecting/cataloguing/researching Canadian music, this pictorial discography—and the “pictorial” part of that description is very important in the digital era--will be immensely valuable. It’s fun to flip through, too, because it offers a new perspective on a whole universe of our music.""</p>

<p>Set to be released in the summer of 2017, this collection of essays covers the wide range of Rollin’s career from 1968’s LE VIOL DU VAMPIRE through his 2010 swansong, LE MASQUE DE LA MÉDUSE, touching upon his horror, fantasy, crime and sex films—including many lesser seen titles. The book closely examines Rollin’s core themes: his focus on overwhelmingly female protagonists, his use of horror genre and exploitation tropes, his reinterpretations of the fairy tale and fantastique, the influence of crime serials, Gothic literature and the occult, as well as much more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492164422/twgw5liqfgrqorvnykkl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>""Rising out of the smoky Parisian Mai 68 shrapnel and claiming his stake as the first French vampire movie director, the inimitable father of European Horrortica, Jean Rollin (1938-2010) has smudged the painted face of surrealist cinema for over five decades. Dragging his roots from beneath the Letterist/Situationist movements, avant-garde theatre, Belgian fine art groups and entwining them around the minds of sexual revolutionaries, the European comic book cognoscenti, the Parisian free jazz and rock scene, Rollin stopped at nothing to bring his macabre phantasies of zygotic vampirism and back-ward blood cults to Gallic cinemateques and beyond."" </i>- Andy Votel, Finders Keepers Records</p>
<p>LOST GIRLS is the third book in Spectacular Optical’s ongoing series of limited run film and pop culture books, which includes KID POWER! (2014) and SATANIC PANIC: POP CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s (2015) and will precede the previously announced YULETIDE TERROR: CHRISTMAS HORROR IN FILM AND TELEVISION, which will be released in fall of 2017.</p>
<p>Curated and edited by Samm Deighan (DIABOLIQUE), contributors to LOST GIRLS include some of the most important critical voices to emerge over the last decade of genre journalism: Alexandra Heller-Nicholas (SENSES OF CINEMA), Kat Ellinger (DIABOLIQUE), Virginie Selavy (ELECTRIC SHEEP), Alison Nastasi (SATANIC PANIC: POP-CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s), Marcelline Block (ART DECADES), Rebecca Booth (DIABOLIQUE), Michelle Alexander (CINEMADROME), Lisa Cunningham (THE LAUGHING DEAD: THE HORROR-COMEDY FILM FROM BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN TO ZOMBIELAND), Heather Drain (DANGEROUS MINDS), Erin Miskell (THAT’S NOT CURRENT), Gianna D’Emilio (DIABOLIQUE) and Kier-La Janisse (HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN), as well as veteran horror journalist Marcelle Perks (SHIVERS, EYEBALL).</p>
<p>Our cover art and chapter headings are being created by illustrator Jessica Seamans, known for her work with <a href=""http://landland.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Landland</a> and posters for MONDO.

<p>The funds raised here will go specifically toward printing costs and artist fees – not only designer fees, but all contributors to the book receive royalties on every copy sold. Part of our goal with Spectacular Optical is to create a small but sustainable business that is able to pay artist fees to the many awesome (and often underpaid) writers and graphic artists working in our field, and to give them books they are proud of. Any writers who contributed to our last books, KID POWER! and SATANIC PANIC: POP-CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s can vouch for us on this count.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Set to be released in the summer of 2017, this collection of essays covers the wide range of Rollin’s career from 1968’s LE VIOL DU VAMPIRE through his 2010 swansong, LE MASQUE DE LA MÉDUSE, touching upon his horror, fantasy, crime and sex films—including many lesser seen titles. The book closely examines Rollin’s core themes: his focus on overwhelmingly female protagonists, his use of horror genre and exploitation tropes, his reinterpretations of the fairy tale and fantastique, the influence of crime serials, Gothic literature and the occult, as well as much more.

""Rising out of the smoky Parisian Mai 68 shrapnel and claiming his stake as the first French vampire movie director, the inimitable father of European Horrortica, Jean Rollin (1938-2010) has smudged the painted face of surrealist cinema for over five decades. Dragging his roots from beneath the Letterist/Situationist movements, avant-garde theatre, Belgian fine art groups and entwining them around the minds of sexual revolutionaries, the European comic book cognoscenti, the Parisian free jazz and rock scene, Rollin stopped at nothing to bring his macabre phantasies of zygotic vampirism and back-ward blood cults to Gallic cinemateques and beyond."" - Andy Votel, Finders Keepers Records
LOST GIRLS is the third book in Spectacular Optical’s ongoing series of limited run film and pop culture books, which includes KID POWER!

Curated and edited by Samm Deighan (DIABOLIQUE), contributors to LOST GIRLS include some of the most important critical voices to emerge over the last decade of genre journalism: Alexandra Heller-Nicholas (SENSES OF CINEMA), Kat Ellinger (DIABOLIQUE), Virginie Selavy (ELECTRIC SHEEP), Alison Nastasi (SATANIC PANIC: POP-CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s), Marcelline Block (ART DECADES), Rebecca Booth (DIABOLIQUE), Michelle Alexander (CINEMADROME), Lisa Cunningham (THE LAUGHING DEAD: THE HORROR-COMEDY FILM FROM BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN TO ZOMBIELAND), Heather Drain (DANGEROUS MINDS), Erin Miskell (THAT’S NOT CURRENT), Gianna D’Emilio (DIABOLIQUE) and Kier-La Janisse (HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN), as well as veteran horror journalist Marcelle Perks (SHIVERS, EYEBALL).
Our cover art and chapter headings are being created by illustrator Jessica Seamans, known for her work with Landland and posters for MONDO. Below is the final artwork for the book's cover, featuring the Castel Twins among a combination of imagery from Rollin's films Fascination and La Rose de Fer:

The funds raised here will go specifically toward printing costs and artist fees – not only designer fees, but all contributors to the book receive royalties on every copy sold. Part of our goal with Spectacular Optical is to create a small but sustainable business that is able to pay artist fees to the many awesome (and often underpaid) writers and graphic artists working in our field, and to give them books they are proud of. Any writers who contributed to our last books, KID POWER! and SATANIC PANIC: POP-CULTURAL PARANOIA IN THE 1980s can vouch for us on this count.

If we don't reach our goal, the book will still be printed and perks will still be delivered - the book is completely written and copy-edited, contracts have been signed, photographs have been sourced and the book is being laid out. We’re well on our way! But pre-sales through Indiegogo ensure the necessary cash flow to keep everything in the allotted timeline so that we can take advantage of promotional opportunities through the busy upcoming festival season. Our goal is to debut the book at the Fantasia International Film Festival in July 2017.
LOST GIRLS will be a beautiful 6X9"", perfect-bound book, roughly 400 pages and heavily illustrated throughout with stills, posters, ads and other visual ephemera related to Rollin's films. If we meet our goal, the book will be printed in full colour. If we don't meet our goal, it will be in B+W with an extensive full-colour section. So if you want your book to be in full colour, please help us spread the word about the campaign so we can get the number of pre-orders we need to make that happen.

Perks are unique added incentives to support the book now; they are free gifts you get with contributions of anything over the basic cost of the book - and some of them are pretty spectacular!
Jessica Seamans who has done our cover art will also be creating the artwork for one of our most unique perks - available in a limited edition of only 50 copies - a full-sized Rollin-themed mystery boardgame! A familiar 'whodunit' game will be given the Rollin treatment, complete with kooky cousins, sinister twins, crypts, coffins, candelabras, a secret passageway behind the grandfather clock and more! All lovingly rendered in Jessica's inimitable illustrative style and professionally manufactured for long-term enjoyment. We've also just confirmed the individual weapons pieces for the game are going to be sculpted by British FX artist Dan Martin, who does the effects for Ben Wheatley’s films, was the effects supervisor on Human Centipede 2, and created the custom cameras used to film Harmony Korine’s Trash Humpers.
Below are some initial rough sketches, and the first complete character card (Isolde from Le frisson des vampires) and room (the master bedroom, also from Le frisson des vampires)!




Here's a short video of FX artist Dan Martin sculpting one of the weapons pieces!

Other perks include Spectacular Optical T-Shirts, Rollin blu-ray box sets from Kino Lorber, Rollin soundtrack CDs from Finders Keepers, books from fellow publishers Headpress, festival passes and tickets to Monster Fest (Melbourne), Fantastic Fest (Austin) and Fantasia (Montreal), season passes to The Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies - London and subscriptions from horror streaming platform Shudder (now available in three countries - US, UK and Canada - and counting!).











And most exciting of all for those who want the true interactive Rollin experience:
Tour de sang: The Rollin Locations TourA three-day tour held approximately September 11-13 2017, through eight French locations from Rollin’s films, including chateaux, cemeteries and more from Levres de Sang (Lips of Blood), Les Frissons des Vampires (Shiver of the Vampires), La Rose de Fer (The Iron Rose), La Vampire nue (The Nude Vampire), Requiem for a Vampire and Rollin’s beloved Dieppe beach, which appeared in many of his films.

<p><strong>MY STORIES ARE MY PASSION</strong></p>
<p>It is my dream to publish my spiritually based fiction. I write feature articles about how the world is undergoing a powerful change in which light and darkness are both growing stronger. I am astounded at how many people are intensely interested in this, and in the personal growth required to cope with this change. I admire the readers who have connected with me and want so much to provide them with fiction, parables and stories, that are well-written and enjoyable, while helping them on this journey.</p>
<p>Do you believe that books can fix the world?</p>
<p>Writing fiction is my passion. It’s a spiritual channeling that tells the stories of our humanity and our collective subconscious. And I believe that stories can fix the world.</p>
<p>My stories are about personal transformation, understanding the miracle of life we are here to discover and be a part of. It’s the product of the unique journey I have been blessed to travel: as suburban New Jersey boy, Manhattan biker-chef of five-star French restaurants, dairyman, IDF reservist, student of Torah, husband, father, and published author and journalist. You can read one of the <a href=""https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/79421/magic-car-fiction/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stories</a> that thousands have already enjoyed on my regular column at <i>Breaking Israel News.</i></p>
<p>WHO IS IT FOR?</p>
<p>These stories are for spiritual people from all faiths who believe in fixing the world.<br/>They believe in the magic of the Self. The more they listen to that inner voice, the more it gives them the power to dream, create, and live their lives from a place of simplicity. This is what changes the world.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480625933/mkoaxcjtqrkvkimt4nle.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHY SUPPORT SPIRITUALLY-BASED FICTION?</strong></p>
<p>My readers are not moved by stories about power, wealth, or physical gratification. They are looking for a higher aspect of their humanity. They have a demand for spiritually-based fiction that is not being met by mainstream publishing. My writing comes from that place and speaks to them on a deep level.</p>
<p>We are living in very special times. And my readers have a powerful inner voice that they hear calling out to them. It’s the voice of the human spirit. People who believe in that inner voice can now support a kind of writing that expresses this powerful voice.</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","MY STORIES ARE MY PASSION
It is my dream to publish my spiritually based fiction. I write feature articles about how the world is undergoing a powerful change in which light and darkness are both growing stronger. I am astounded at how many people are intensely interested in this, and in the personal growth required to cope with this change. I admire the readers who have connected with me and want so much to provide them with fiction, parables and stories, that are well-written and enjoyable, while helping them on this journey.
Do you believe that books can fix the world?
Writing fiction is my passion. It’s a spiritual channeling that tells the stories of our humanity and our collective subconscious. And I believe that stories can fix the world.
My stories are about personal transformation, understanding the miracle of life we are here to discover and be a part of. It’s the product of the unique journey I have been blessed to travel: as suburban New Jersey boy, Manhattan biker-chef of five-star French restaurants, dairyman, IDF reservist, student of Torah, husband, father, and published author and journalist. You can read one of the stories that thousands have already enjoyed on my regular column at Breaking Israel News.
WHO IS IT FOR?
These stories are for spiritual people from all faiths who believe in fixing the world.They believe in the magic of the Self. The more they listen to that inner voice, the more it gives them the power to dream, create, and live their lives from a place of simplicity. This is what changes the world.  

WHY SUPPORT SPIRITUALLY-BASED FICTION?
My readers are not moved by stories about power, wealth, or physical gratification. They are looking for a higher aspect of their humanity. They have a demand for spiritually-based fiction that is not being met by mainstream publishing. My writing comes from that place and speaks to them on a deep level.
We are living in very special times. And my readers have a powerful inner voice that they hear calling out to them. It’s the voice of the human spirit. People who believe in that inner voice can now support a kind of writing that expresses this powerful voice.
YOUR OPPORTUNITY
So if you connect to this, then I want to make my powerful stories available to you. This is an opportunity to help create my upcoming short-story collection, Dolphins on the Moon.

<p> </p>
<h3>   My name is William Wright. I am the author of Woo Her The Wright Way - Be the Man Every Woman Wants (c) 2013.</h3>
<h3>   I wrote this book to share effective concepts that “Any Man” can easily follow to create a positive, passionate, loving and long lasting relationship with the woman he desires.   </h3>
<h3>   I started writing the book while I was going through a rough time period in my own personal relationship.   The realization that I came to was it is partially my own fault and I had to take responsibility and fix it.   I discovered there are many ways for a man to win the heart of the woman he desires, forever.  </h3>
<h3>   I have enthusiastically experimented with these ideas and the rewards have been tremendous.  These concepts are simple to learn and easy to use.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who is this book is for?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>   This book is for <em>All</em> men.  If you are looking to meet a woman or you have been married for fifty years, the easy to follow ideas in this book can create or renew your relationship with the woman you love.  With all the technology and the fast paced lives we lead in the twenty-first century, the later generations of men have not been taught the basics. </h3>
<h3>   Become the kind of man women want to date and marry.</h3>
<h3>  </h3>
<h2> <strong>Who can benefit from the book?   </strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>   Both men and women will benefit.</h3>
<h3>   All men can benefit from learning the helpful techniques to have the love of the woman they desire.  You will gain more pleasure from an exciting, loving and long lasting relationship then you thought possible. </h3>
<h3>   Women will reap the rewards by having a passionate as well as heightened emotional and physical connection with your man.</h3>
<h3>   When was the last time you got a text from your girlfriend/wife randomly in a day saying “Just thinking of you makes me smile?”  Would you like to?</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Basis of the book   </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>1)  Having a woman fall in love with you is a combination of emotional, physical and psychological factors.  Gain knowledge of the proper cues and techniques to earn her trust, love and passion. </h3>
<h3>   Set yourself apart from previous men she has dated.  Learn how to set emotional and physical “feel good” buttons for her.  Grow individually and as couple. Every chapter is packed with practical information that will make her love you more.  </h3>
<h3>2)  You will also learn what it takes to build the exciting, loving, positive and long lasting relationship you want.</h3>
<h3>   </h3>
<h3>   The book is set around a group of 5 buddies having a Guy's Night Out.  They are talking about how much or how little they know about women.  My goal was to write the book similar to the way we would talk and express our points of view within an average group of guys. </h3>
<h3>   It covers the psychological, emotional and physical aspects of growing a strong positive relationship from your first meeting to your fiftieth wedding anniversary.</h3>
<h3>   It is written in simple and easy to read language.  The book’s appeal is the sharing of amusing stories, stirring life experiences and simple yet extremely successful concepts that are easy to apply.</h3>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What is the reaction of the test readers?    </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>   I have studied, attended seminars, consulted with psychologists, relationship therapists, average men and women to confirm that the theories in this book are accurate.  I felt it was crucial the test readers included both men and women. </h3>
<h3>   All the test readers’ reviews were not only positive but every single one felt these were valuable and practical ideas that could be implemented easily and successfully.</h3>
<h3>   I have very exciting reviews from relationship professionals that will appear on the back of the book.  They confirm the accuracy of the information and ease of use in the manner it is presented. </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Professional reviews to appear on back cover </span>– (Full names will appear on book)</h3>
<h3>“William Wright has combined a Guys Night Out with keen insight into the nature of relationships.  The result is this book:  An accurate guide book for men on how to create the successful relationship you want.”</h3>
<h3>- PhD, Psychologist - Male</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>“I have been counseling couples for decades.  William Wright wrote the perfect book for men who desire a successful relationship but need some great and practical advice on how to build one.”</h3>
<h3>- LCSW, Marriage Counseling Specialist - Female</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>“William Wright shares the psychological aspects of relationships with accuracy and amusement.  This book breaks down the ideas in easy to understand language and even easier to implement concepts.”</h3>
<h3>- PhD, Psychologist – Male</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Additional test reader reviews</span></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> “Instead of taking a sneak peak into relationships, William Wright has pulled the curtain wide open for all men see.  I don’t know any woman who would not want their man to learn from this book.  Woo Her The Wright Way is a Winner.”</h3>
<h3>- Actress – Female</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>“William Wright has brought new meaning to The Study of Man.  This book addresses topics most men won’t admit they want to talk about and never do.  The lessons in this book are priceless. From the chronically shy to the most confident alpha male, there is something for everyone in this book.”</h3>
<h3>- Teacher - Male</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is the status of the project?   </strong></h2>

   My name is William Wright. I am the author of Woo Her The Wright Way - Be the Man Every Woman Wants (c) 2013.
   I wrote this book to share effective concepts that “Any Man” can easily follow to create a positive, passionate, loving and long lasting relationship with the woman he desires.   
   I started writing the book while I was going through a rough time period in my own personal relationship.   The realization that I came to was it is partially my own fault and I had to take responsibility and fix it.   I discovered there are many ways for a man to win the heart of the woman he desires, forever.  
   I have enthusiastically experimented with these ideas and the rewards have been tremendous.  These concepts are simple to learn and easy to use.
 
Who is this book is for?
 
   This book is for All men.  If you are looking to meet a woman or you have been married for fifty years, the easy to follow ideas in this book can create or renew your relationship with the woman you love.  With all the technology and the fast paced lives we lead in the twenty-first century, the later generations of men have not been taught the basics. 
   Become the kind of man women want to date and marry.
  
 Who can benefit from the book?   

 
   Both men and women will benefit.
   All men can benefit from learning the helpful techniques to have the love of the woman they desire.  You will gain more pleasure from an exciting, loving and long lasting relationship then you thought possible. 
   Women will reap the rewards by having a passionate as well as heightened emotional and physical connection with your man.
   When was the last time you got a text from your girlfriend/wife randomly in a day saying “Just thinking of you makes me smile?”  Would you like to?
 
Basis of the book   
 
1)  Having a woman fall in love with you is a combination of emotional, physical and psychological factors.  Gain knowledge of the proper cues and techniques to earn her trust, love and passion. 
   Set yourself apart from previous men she has dated.  Learn how to set emotional and physical “feel good” buttons for her.  Grow individually and as couple. Every chapter is packed with practical information that will make her love you more.  
2)  You will also learn what it takes to build the exciting, loving, positive and long lasting relationship you want.
   
   The book is set around a group of 5 buddies having a Guy's Night Out.  They are talking about how much or how little they know about women.  My goal was to write the book similar to the way we would talk and express our points of view within an average group of guys. 
   It covers the psychological, emotional and physical aspects of growing a strong positive relationship from your first meeting to your fiftieth wedding anniversary.
   It is written in simple and easy to read language.  The book’s appeal is the sharing of amusing stories, stirring life experiences and simple yet extremely successful concepts that are easy to apply.
 
What is the reaction of the test readers?    
 
   I have studied, attended seminars, consulted with psychologists, relationship therapists, average men and women to confirm that the theories in this book are accurate.  I felt it was crucial the test readers included both men and women. 
   All the test readers’ reviews were not only positive but every single one felt these were valuable and practical ideas that could be implemented easily and successfully.
   I have very exciting reviews from relationship professionals that will appear on the back of the book.  They confirm the accuracy of the information and ease of use in the manner it is presented. 
 

Professional reviews to appear on back cover – (Full names will appear on book)
“William Wright has combined a Guys Night Out with keen insight into the nature of relationships.  The result is this book:  An accurate guide book for men on how to create the successful relationship you want.”
- PhD, Psychologist - Male
 
“I have been counseling couples for decades.  William Wright wrote the perfect book for men who desire a successful relationship but need some great and practical advice on how to build one.”
- LCSW, Marriage Counseling Specialist - Female
 
“William Wright shares the psychological aspects of relationships with accuracy and amusement.  This book breaks down the ideas in easy to understand language and even easier to implement concepts.”
- PhD, Psychologist – Male
 
Additional test reader reviews
 
 “Instead of taking a sneak peak into relationships, William Wright has pulled the curtain wide open for all men see.  I don’t know any woman who would not want their man to learn from this book.  Woo Her The Wright Way is a Winner.”
- Actress – Female
 
“William Wright has brought new meaning to The Study of Man.  This book addresses topics most men won’t admit they want to talk about and never do.  The lessons in this book are priceless. From the chronically shy to the most confident alpha male, there is something for everyone in this book.”
- Teacher - Male
 
What is the status of the project?   
 
The book is basically finished.  I am working on some final revisions.  I am hoping to raise enough money for this project because writing it is the only free part of the process. 
   I am investing what I can from my own funds but more money is needed.  The copy editing, proofreading, interior design, cover design, website design and implementation, printing, marketing, and promotional materials to create a quality product are surprisingly expensive.  I would also like to be able to attend at least one larger book convention this year, to promote the book.

</div>","Sharing My Story
Hi!  I'm Lynn Sanders, CEO/Founder of Park Avenue Marketing, LLC, and online host at Difference Makers Media.  My passion is telling and sharing inspirational stories that educate, inspire and transform our world.  
I've spent over 25 years promoting heart-centered entrepreneurs and causes through writing, videos and online media.  This story is one I never forgot.   
                                                

The ""Dancing With Tex"" Story...
Imagine a friendship between a man and a bird.                                                                      A friendship demonstrating the power of belief, faith and perseverance.                        A friendship that helped save the Whooping Cranes from extinction.
“Dancing With Tex – A Special Friendship,” is a vibrantly illustrated picture book that touches the mind and heart.  Children will treasure this story that raises awareness about our endangered cranes, and helps children realize we all can make a positive difference in the world.
*************************************************************************The Impact 
Our minds get affected by what we see and hear.  We're often subjected to negativity in our news and movies.  Our world needs more inspiration, and this story can be the start for more ""difference maker"" stories.   

Over 30 years ago, this little-known story amazed audiences on the Johnny Carson show. Through this book, we will:  

  * Raise greater awareness about preserving and protecting our environment               * Motivate youth to recognize how each of us can make a difference                                 * Support the International Crane Foundation, the world's only sanctuary for all fifteen species of cranes.       

                                   

After costs are covered, I will give a portion of royalties back to the International Crane Foundation.

Risks & Challenges

                                                         My ""Behind The Scenes"" StoryIt happened during a video shoot in 1995 at the International Crane Foundation. Off-camera, Dr. George Archibald told me about his friendship with Tex, a rare Whooping Crane.  I thought it would make a great children's book.After years of effort and numerous rejections, the story eventually DID get accepted.  I was thrilled.  But then, the unexpected happened...The publishing company ran out of money!  I kept going.  I collaborated on a children's musical to bring this story to life with music, choreography and humor. Here's a poster from the show.                                    
""A Whooper's Tale:  The Incredible Story of Tex"" was performed at the former Theatre Building Chicago in 2009. Book writer Jenny Stafford and composer Russ Coutinho did an outstanding job. I wrote the lyrics. We got rave reviews!     As we seek sponsors, we'll also promote this story to raise environmental awareness.  Our story is intended to empower, motivate and inspire youth that we all can make a difference.  Ultimately, ""Dancing With Tex"" will provide the foundation for more empowering books in the future.  Other Ways You Can Help

<div>
<h4><i>Stories from the Polycule: Real Life in Polyamorous Families</i></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Stories from the Polycule</i> by Dr. Elisabeth Sheff is an anthology of of work from people living in polyamorous families of all configurations, from solo poly people to live-in networks to elders, with or without children. The anthology will include both writing and visual art, and will range from a few sentences to several thousand words. Submissions are coming from children, tweens and teens growing up in poly families, to adults and elders. They deal with the day-to-day experiences of living polyamorously. (Scroll down to ""Get involved"" for information on contributing your story!)</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>
<i>The Husband Swap: A Memoir</i> (second edition)</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the true story of a couple that fell in love with another couple and tried to make it work as a polyamorous quad. With raw and intimate prose, Louisa Leontiades unflinchingly shares her story, with all the drama, passion, joy and conflict that goes along with it. Many will recognize their own experiences in her story, as she and her husband stumble for the first time to find a path to a sustainable polyamorous future.</p>
<p>This is the second edition of <i>The Husband Swap,</i> re-edited, redesigned and with new material.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><i>The Game Changer: A Memoir</i></h4>
<p>Franklin Veaux has written, in <i>More Than Two</i> and on his blog, about the ""game-changing relationship"": the relationship that changes you, and what you want from life, so much that it upsets what you'd thought were the stable, permanent, comfortable rules of the game. Game-changing relationships can make your life better, but change is hard - and it can be particularly hard for the other people in your life, who didn't necessarily sign on to having you change, and may feel left behind. They are, by definition, disruptive. They can be burdened by shame stemming from monogamous norms, and polyamorous people don't yet have good models for dealing with them.</p>
<p>Over a decade ago, Franklin had a game-changing relationship that changed his life and forever altered his thinking about polyamory (and the writings at morethantwo.com). <i>The Game Changer</i> will share that story, to help anyone who's ever experienced a game-changing relationship understand they are not alone, and there is a path through what may feel like madness.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><i>NEW! Lessons to My Younger Self: A Companion Guide to The Husband Swap</i></h4>
<p>Writing a memoir is an eye-opening experience. Looking back on her early mistakes now, with nearly a decade of experience in polyamory behind her, gave Louisa a chance to consider the mistakes she made and the people she hurt--and what she'd do differently if she had it to do over. Now she's turning those lessons into a companion e-book for <i>The Husband Swap. </i>A short, easy-to-read piece with a lesson drawn from each chapter, <i>Lessons to My Younger Self</i> will include illustrations by Tikva Wolf.</p>
<p>We're releasing <i>Lessons to My Younger Self</i> alongside <i>The Husband Swap</i> in 2015, and if we meet our goal, <i>all</i> backers will get an e-copy!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><i>NEW! Coming Out Poly: A Booklet for Family and Friends</i></h4>
<p>We've been asked numerous times to provide content that a polyamorous person can give to family and friends when they're coming out, to help educate them about polyamory. We think Dr. Sheff is the perfect person to write such a piece, and she's agreed to do so! We're publishing the book in fall 2015, and if we meet our funding goal, all backers will get a copy!</p>

We're thrilled to be publishing three well-known authors in 2015.

Dr. Elisabeth Sheff
 

 
One of just a handful of global academic experts on polyamory and the foremost international expert on children in polyamorous families, Dr. Sheff is an educational consultant and expert witness serving sexual and gender minorities. Last year she published The Polyamorists Next Door: Inside Multiple-Partner Relationships and Families, which showcased the results of a 15-year study on polyamorous families. 
Dr. Sheff’s research explains the unique strategies polyamorists use in navigating their complex family lives and describes how they could prove tremendously useful for people in monogamous relationships, as well as other gender and sexual minorities like kinksters and people on the transgender spectrum. She lives in Atlanta with her girlfriend, their children, dog, cats, and the small wild animals the cats bring in.
 
Louisa Leontiades


A freelance writer originally from the UK, Louisa lives in an open relationship with her partners and two children in Sweden. She writes full-time on her blog, Postmodern Woman, and is chairwoman of the National Polyamory Association. She also writes for Huffington Post, Salon, Nerve, Jezebel and the Guardian. She lives a life that makes for a lot of stories.
 
 
 
Franklin Veaux

 Franklin is the co-author of the groundbreaking new book More Than Two: A Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory, and the author of the Web's top-ranked polyamory site, morethantwo.com. He is also the creator of Onyx: The Game of Sexual Exploration, maintains the sites xeromag.com, symtoys.com and thinkbeyond.us, publishes erotic fiction under the pen name William Vitelli, and is the co-founder of both Thorntree Press and the Vancouver, Canada-based sex toy R&D company Tacit Pleasures.
 

Tikva Wolf
 Tikva is the creator of the popular polyamory Web comic Kimchi Cuddles. She's been drawing ever since I could hold a crayon. After undergoing many different artistic incarnations, she realized that what she primarily cares about in art (and life) is connecting to people, creating dialogue and spreading awareness.  She's always taken delight in making people laugh, and in doing so also unveiling hidden perspectives.  Comedy has the ability to transform heavy topics into something that’s easier to digest.  She uses humor as a way of being seen deeply, and as a way of encouraging others to deeply see themselves and each other.

 
 


The Books
Your contribution will support production costs - editing, design, proofreading and printing - for the three amazing books Thorntree Press has in the pipeline for 2015.

Stories from the Polycule: Real Life in Polyamorous Families
 
Stories from the Polycule by Dr. Elisabeth Sheff is an anthology of of work from people living in polyamorous families of all configurations, from solo poly people to live-in networks to elders, with or without children. The anthology will include both writing and visual art, and will range from a few sentences to several thousand words. Submissions are coming from children, tweens and teens growing up in poly families, to adults and elders. They deal with the day-to-day experiences of living polyamorously. (Scroll down to ""Get involved"" for information on contributing your story!)
 

The Husband Swap: A Memoir (second edition)
 
This is the true story of a couple that fell in love with another couple and tried to make it work as a polyamorous quad. With raw and intimate prose, Louisa Leontiades unflinchingly shares her story, with all the drama, passion, joy and conflict that goes along with it. Many will recognize their own experiences in her story, as she and her husband stumble for the first time to find a path to a sustainable polyamorous future.
This is the second edition of The Husband Swap, re-edited, redesigned and with new material.
 
The Game Changer: A Memoir
Franklin Veaux has written, in More Than Two and on his blog, about the ""game-changing relationship"": the relationship that changes you, and what you want from life, so much that it upsets what you'd thought were the stable, permanent, comfortable rules of the game. Game-changing relationships can make your life better, but change is hard - and it can be particularly hard for the other people in your life, who didn't necessarily sign on to having you change, and may feel left behind. They are, by definition, disruptive. They can be burdened by shame stemming from monogamous norms, and polyamorous people don't yet have good models for dealing with them.
Over a decade ago, Franklin had a game-changing relationship that changed his life and forever altered his thinking about polyamory (and the writings at morethantwo.com). The Game Changer will share that story, to help anyone who's ever experienced a game-changing relationship understand they are not alone, and there is a path through what may feel like madness.
 
NEW! Lessons to My Younger Self: A Companion Guide to The Husband Swap
Writing a memoir is an eye-opening experience. Looking back on her early mistakes now, with nearly a decade of experience in polyamory behind her, gave Louisa a chance to consider the mistakes she made and the people she hurt--and what she'd do differently if she had it to do over. Now she's turning those lessons into a companion e-book for The Husband Swap. A short, easy-to-read piece with a lesson drawn from each chapter, Lessons to My Younger Self will include illustrations by Tikva Wolf.
We're releasing Lessons to My Younger Self alongside The Husband Swap in 2015, and if we meet our goal, all backers will get an e-copy!
 
 
NEW! Coming Out Poly: A Booklet for Family and Friends

Worldwide:
  - Every year 60 million girls are sexually assaulted at or on
their way to school. 
  - 1-3 women have been beaten or sexually abused in their lifetime.
  - At least 60 million girls are missing form their populations-
mostly in Asia as a 
     result of infanticide or sex related abortion.  - Women and Girls are 80% of 640,000 of the
estimated 800,000 trafficked    across national borders annually with the majority
505,600 being trafficked for 
    sexual exploitation.
  - In some parts of the world girls are more likely to be raped
than to learn  
    how to read.  
  - Over 60 million girls worldwide are child brides, 31.3 million
in S Africa. Violence  
     & abuse characterize married life for most
of these girls. 
  - Boys who witness their fathers violence are 10 times more likely
to engage in  
     spousal abuse in later adulthood. 
  - Up to 5% of women report being physically abused while
pregnant, 50% of  
     physically abused Indian women reported being abused
while pregnant
  - Between 100 & 140 millions girls alive today have been
subjected to Female  
     Genital Mutilation. In 6 African countries 80% of
women have been subjected 
     to this torture.

$300 & for each of these same 30 femfolk to unite 2 matching legacy council
member pledges in hopes of surpassing perhaps, the $30,000 foundational budget! Our amazing legacy donors have the option of receiving a signed copy

contribution, moreover, contributors always have the option of giving anonymously, any amount and without claiming a
perk. Conversely, however, please keep in mind the potential strategy of  donating 300$ & affiliating 2 other femmefolk
to match your gift amount within the incoming days
of the campaign. Needless to say no donation is too big or too small. We urge you to give as BIG as you can afford, for ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE KEY! Visit us on FB & Twitter, #TransFemDrive & share this momentous councilship call-to-action as wide & far possible. Can

to her gender, wrote, ""The only way that I will rest in peace is if one 
day transgendered people aren't treated the way that I was, they're 
treated like humans with valid feelings, & human rights. Gender needs to be taught about in school the earlier the better. My
 death needs to mean something. My death needs to be counted in the 
number of transgender people who commit suicide this year. I want 
someone to look at that number & say that's fucked up and fix it. Fix society. Please.""  Fixing society is contingent upon us all, together we will prevent future transteen of color suicides, violence against queer women of color, rape, systemic violence, personal violence & all exploitation!!!

""Feminism as a movement to end sexism, sexist exploitation, & 
oppression is alive & well & the renewal of a mass based 
feminist movement is our primary goal, to ensure the continued relevance
 of the feminist movement in our lives visionary feminist theory must be
 constantly made & re-made so that it addresses us where we live, in
 our present. Women & men have made great strides in the direction 
of gender equality, & those strides towards freedom must give us 
strength to go further. We must courageously learn from the past & 
work for a future where feminist principles will undergird every aspect 
of our public & private lives. Feminist politics aims to end 
domination to free us to be who we are ~ to live lives where we love 
justice, where we can live in peace. Feminism Is For Everybody.""                         ~ collaborate quotation, bell hooks & xothi tellez, edited by xothi tellez                                                        Visionary Feminism: Feminism Is For Everybody ★

This past summer, a local court in Germany ruled that circumcision constitutes a criminal assault. This set off an international firestorm of debate.  Before the German Parliament responded, another major event occurred: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released their new circumcision policy statement. Their conclusion—that “the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks”—contradicts earlier policy statements and goes against the rising tide of medical literature documenting the harms of circumcision, and the consensus of the international medical community.</span></span></p>

Hi,
I'm Steven Svoboda, founder of Attorneys for the Rights of the Child (ARC), a non-profit organization that has been working hard since early 1997 to secure equal protection for, and broaden judicial and public recognition of, children’s legal and human rights to bodily integrity and self-determination.
Our work has borne very satisfying fruit over the past twelve months. As opposition continues and even expands in certain areas, ARC and our fellow intactivists are making unprecedented inroads in safeguarding genital integrity, achieving goals of which we could only have dreamt in past years.
 
Project Description
Our current project—perhaps one of our most important projects to date—is a paper we hope to use to advocate for legal changes in Germany with some intactivists with whom we are in contact there. The paper is being written for Springer and will update my well-received presentation in Helsinki for the 12th International Symposium on Circumcision. My presentation covered the Cologne Court decision and legal developments in Germany, titled, “Strange Yet Familiar Bedfellows - Effectively Addressing Chronic Issues Encountered when Law and Human Rights Seek to Protect Bodily Integrity,” and was extremely well received at the conference. You can find the abstract and a link to the full version here: http://arclaw.org/announcements/steven-svoboda-present-nocirc-symposium-helsinki-finland-september-30-october-2-2012-a
To this end, we need to have a number of important German legal cases and law review articles professionally translated to English.
 
Project Background
ARC's work in educating policy and lawmakers has paid off greatly in 2012-2013. This past summer, a local court in Germany ruled that circumcision constitutes a criminal assault. This set off an international firestorm of debate.  Before the German Parliament responded, another major event occurred: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released their new circumcision policy statement. Their conclusion—that “the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks”—contradicts earlier policy statements and goes against the rising tide of medical literature documenting the harms of circumcision, and the consensus of the international medical community.
While this was a major setback, we sat tight and wrote a letter to the AAP's Pediatrics journal, which was not published by Pediatrics but was published elsewhere. The German Pediatrics Association read our statement online and cited us in their report on male circumcision to the German Parliament, perhaps the most incriminating report ever on male circumcision from a doctors organization. We were cited for our exemplary efforts in the United States working to end circumcision.
 
List of ARC's Achievements


We helped to end Medicaid funding for routine infant circumcision in steventeen states through hundreds of phone calls, letters, and scholarship.


Work at the UN (part of the UN permanent record):


We presented a petition to the UN Sub-Commission on August 9, 2001, available here on our website: http://arclaw.org/our-work/presentations/oral-intervention-united-nations-regarding-male-circumcision


We presented an oral intervention to a session of the UN Sub-Commission on August 14, 2001, available here on the UN website: http://www.unchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridocda.nsf/(Symbol)/E.CN.4.Sub.2.2002.NGO.1.En




We received the 2002 Human Rights Award from the International Symposium on Human Rights and Modern Society.


Our work has been recognized by Harvard Law School, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Men’s Health Magazine, and numerous other well-known organizations and publications.


ARC has represented plaintiffs in several state and federal lawsuits to protect genital integrity.


We have published 27 issues of our Newsletter in the past 11 years, helping to spread news about intactivism and to maintain spirits among activists in this often demanding work. Our newsletter is carried by all three of the top content providers that electronically provide journals to libraries throughout the world! These three are ProQuest, EBSCO and Cengage (formerly Gale). Click here to view our latest issue: http://arclaw.org/newsletter/latest



We recently released a list that we have been painstakingly compiling since our founding in 1997 of all known significant legal awards and settlements in circumcision-related lawsuits. Click here to view the list: http://arclaw.org/resources/settlements


We recently marked the one-year anniversary of the release of our “Know Your Rights Brochure,” available on our website for potential litigants on how to see legal compensation for the wrong of circumcision. Click here to view the brochure: http://arclaw.org/announcements/circumcision-your-legal-rights


We helped organize a special issue on circumcision of the world’s top ethical journal, the UK’s Journal of Medical Ethics. The JME published two of my articles in this issue, one concerning male circumcision, human rights, and customary law, and the other analyzing the AAP’s policy statement and technical report. Click here to view our press release: http://arclaw.org/resources/press-releases/new-arc-article-finds-fault-pediatric-organization%E2%80%99s-support-circumcision-pThe Jewish Press, the largest weekly newspaper read by Orthodox Jews, favorably mentioned the article by me and pediatrician Robert S. Van Howe. Click here to view the article: http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/human-rights-lawyer-challenging-aap-pro-circumcision-stance/2013/03/19/

I will be debating the American Academy of Pediatrics' Susan Blank, M.D. in a talk entitled, ""Newborn Male Circumcision is Unethical and Should be Illegal,” at the Medical University of South Carolina in October 2013.



We have accepted an invitation to attend a two-day conference in Keele, United Kingdom this September, at which we will present a paper entitled, “The Right to Bodily Integrity as a Right to Genital Autonomy in Law and Human Rights,” that seeks to prove that the history of leading United Nations human rights documents supports a right to bodily and genital integrity.  



Publication is imminent by Springer, one of the world’s top academic publishers, of the proceedings from the 2010 Berkeley symposium, to be entitled “The Rights of the Child: Ensuring Every Child's Fundamental Right to Body Ownership and Protection from Medical, Cultural, and Religious Infringements.” The book will—for the second successive time—lead off with my article, which analyzed problems applying informed consent to male circumcision and is entitled, “Tortured Bodies, Tortured Doctrines: Informed Consent As a Legal Fiction Inapplicable to Neonatal Male Circumcision.”



A special issue of Global Discourse relating to genital autonomy will be publishing our paper entitled, ""“That Awful Darkness”—Protecting all from genital cutting and bridging the gaps that perpetuate the practices.""  




In Search of Fatherhood magazine will feature me on the cover of their first issue in 2013, along with another reprint. I was featured on the cover of three of their four 2012 issues, each of which reprinted a different article of mine.

<p>Hello, my name is Alexander Leontakis. A while ago I wrote a novel named Angel in the Stars. I heard a lot of good things about it. What I also heard almost every single time when I got a response about my novel is that I’m a new writer. Every publishing house in their own subtle way was telling me that in these times they were not willing to risk a book from a new writer.</p>
<p>That is until Empeiria Publishing agreed to publish it. But this is Greece of 2013, no one has it easy. So I was told I had to share the cost of just the first edition. Should the book sell there will be more editions and the royalties I’m entitled will follow.</p>
<p>The thing is I don’t have the initial capital I’m asked for and that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>It would mean the world to me if I could get my first novel published. All I need is this sum of money to make it happen.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake most people make when they look for a job is they try to do it on their own. The average person looks for a job once every few years so they are not experts.  Looking for a job without support is like trying to ski or play golf without lessons.  Furthermore, with changes in technology and markets, the job search process is constantly changing.  What worked best five years ago doesn’t apply today. Thus the first step any person looking for a job should take is - join a job search support group.  The group can help with all the other steps such as finding opportunities, writing a resume, interviewing skills, and researching employers and company culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most job search experts will tell you that few people find jobs by searching through listings on job sites, and that the best way to get a job is through networking.  Joining a job support group is networking on steroids.  LinkedIn tells its members that people with a few hundred direct contacts can have several million contacts two levels removed.  Working with contacts who are in the same situation affords high quality contacts that can be shared by the group.  As part of a group you can pass along and benefit from leads that may not be right for you, but may be ideal for another member.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fortunately, the best groups are free or minimal cost to job hunters, which is especially important when income is limited between jobs.  While most people using job search support groups are unemployed at the time they join, job search support groups can be useful for people looking to change jobs while still employed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ironically, the best support groups are all volunteer organizations that follow the pay it forward philosophy.  Simply stated, pay it forward says that when you are in a time of need you get support from someone who asks that when your situation improves you pay your debt forward to another person in need, rather than back to the person who helped you.  Support groups continue to be effective when helping people dealing with common problems such as, grief, addiction, and severe trauma.</p>

</div></div>","The biggest mistake most people make when they look for a job is they try to do it on their own. The average person looks for a job once every few years so they are not experts.  Looking for a job without support is like trying to ski or play golf without lessons.  Furthermore, with changes in technology and markets, the job search process is constantly changing.  What worked best five years ago doesn’t apply today. Thus the first step any person looking for a job should take is - join a job search support group.  The group can help with all the other steps such as finding opportunities, writing a resume, interviewing skills, and researching employers and company culture.
 
Most job search experts will tell you that few people find jobs by searching through listings on job sites, and that the best way to get a job is through networking.  Joining a job support group is networking on steroids.  LinkedIn tells its members that people with a few hundred direct contacts can have several million contacts two levels removed.  Working with contacts who are in the same situation affords high quality contacts that can be shared by the group.  As part of a group you can pass along and benefit from leads that may not be right for you, but may be ideal for another member.
 
Fortunately, the best groups are free or minimal cost to job hunters, which is especially important when income is limited between jobs.  While most people using job search support groups are unemployed at the time they join, job search support groups can be useful for people looking to change jobs while still employed.
 
Ironically, the best support groups are all volunteer organizations that follow the pay it forward philosophy.  Simply stated, pay it forward says that when you are in a time of need you get support from someone who asks that when your situation improves you pay your debt forward to another person in need, rather than back to the person who helped you.  Support groups continue to be effective when helping people dealing with common problems such as, grief, addiction, and severe trauma.

Why Fund This Campaign
Job seekers need all the help they can get to find work as quickly as possible.  Publishing a book the traditional way is a long and difficult process.  There are many books available on job hunting, but none of them have a primary focus on job hunting as a group effort. Ironically, this is the most important factor in finding a good job quickly.
 
Besides the support of pledges on Indiegogo I hope this campaign can help spread the word that in the age of electronic media and enhanced communication there is a need for a return to basic face-to-face communication.  This is mostly an untold story that I want to tell.
 
Support groups with as few as 12-20 members are the most effective.  Almost anyone could be the founder of a local support group.  Another goal of this project is to share information on establishing, structuring and running local networking groups with individuals, nonprofits, local government, and state government organizations established to support anyone in career transition.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This is a true story about one of the largest open source research projects in
post-modern times, that was responsible for spurring off the second coming of green technology
revolution in the field of fuel economy. Led by a small group of people with a vision, they would take on the responsibility of legitimizing a
movement into industry segment within the automotive and <b><a href=""http://extremeenergysolutions.net/Our_Product_Lines.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">green tech</a></b> sector. </p>
<p>This story is an account of a series of events which triggered
a subculture of inventors, inventors, patriots, green enthusiast, marketeers, mechanics,
business men, entrepreneurs, to take action setting out to do what was called
“the impossible.” What was the impossible? To get fifty percent or more in fuel
economy out of the current automobile with the help of a controversial
technology; the <b><a href=""http://samburlum.com/did-it-really-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hydro Assist Fuel Cell</a></b> (or HAFC for short). </p>
<p>The cast of characters from diverse
backgrounds, come together to enhance the technologies
capabilities as they each add their own ideas to the mix, allowing the <b>HAFC</b> to
deliver far beyond the original expectations. The HAFC would soon
become legend in specialized social circles; thus capturing the imagination of
a few local race car hobbyist and car enthusiast.  They would later not just
prove the technology could work; they would push the boundaries of HAFC to

<p>These

<p>So what

<p>As any

<p>I lived happily in the house in the little story for 35 years, but I got broke and had to move out.<br/></p>
<p>The snapshots in this picture book are, for me, a fond memory of my former home, my little grandchildren and the many creatures who visited my garden. There is Bad Angus, Miranda my own little cat, Mr Foxy, a robin and some gliding swans. It is situated in central Edinburgh, Scotland, very near to the Queens Park and Holyrood Palace the official home of The Queen in Scotland.

 with a publisher. This seems to mean that I pay for all the publishing costs, and if I hope to sell any books, I have discovered, I have to pay for all advertising too, or no-one will ever know about the book.
So, PLEASE, anyone hitting on this campaign, contribute £1 or $1 or as little
as you wish.  I have nearly enough now for a newspaper advertisement.
Bad Angus and Mr Foxy would be well pleased

I lived happily in the house in the little story for 35 years, but I got broke and had to move out.
The snapshots in this picture book are, for me, a fond memory of my former home, my little grandchildren and the many creatures who visited my garden. There is Bad Angus, Miranda my own little cat, Mr Foxy, a robin and some gliding swans. It is situated in central Edinburgh, Scotland, very near to the Queens Park and Holyrood Palace the official home of The Queen in Scotland.


Little children would like this happy story where Bad Angus turns out to be 
Brave Angus.
You can see it on Amazon books."".Bad Angus by Laura Bennett"".. look inside there too.
Also see the three reviews on Amazon.
Only 9 people have bought the book so far because people do not know it
exists.  This is why I am requesting donations from you, please, for publicity
to let people know about it.

<p>  Hi, my name is Vic. I am 72 and full of the energy and desire to make a huge difference in the lives of children and adults. I have reinvented myself as a milkman, baker, appliance repair and sales, refished antique furniture,  bought and sold treasures I found at garage sales on Ebay, and now I am a published author. All in spite of being raised in a disfunctional family. I am always looking for a better way to help those I meet with what i have learned along my path in life. I get things done.</p>
<p>  For to many years I suffered needlessly from the debilitating fear of expressing my <strong>True Self</strong> in front of people. I was raised when saying like, “Kids were to be seen and not heard,”  and ""Sticks and Stones will break your bones, but <strong>‘WORDS’</strong> can never hurt you,"" among many other negative debilitating beliefs. Feelings and questions were not allowed to be expressed. At a young age, before I became aware of having a choice about what I wanted to feel,<strong> ‘words’ and 'beliefs'</strong> were thrown into the mind of my defenseless being, eroding the very core of my <strong>TRUE SELF</strong>. <br/><br/>  In an attempt to rid myself of this fear, I began to notice children and adults with the same issue, the inability to expressing themselves with power and confidence. This lack of power in expressing one's true self came from somewhere and I was committed to finding out its cause.</p>
<p>  So  I created the <strong>Magicardstory™ ""Little Joe and the Joker"" </strong>a Magic Card Story told by you and a deck of playing cards. Even though you have someone cut the cards 5 different times, the cards match the story as it unfolds, creating a ... Magical Illusion ... of the cards <strong>APPPEARING</strong> .............. <strong>AS YOU SPEAK!</strong></p>
<p><br/>  Then I created the <strong>Magicardstory™</strong> called: <strong>“The Wizard of Wishes,”</strong> a Magic Card Story told by you and a deck of playing cards. Even though you have someone cut the cards 5 different times, the cards match the story as it unfolds, creating a ... Magical Illusion ... of the cards <strong>APPPEARING</strong> .............. <strong>AS YOU SPEAK! <br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> I began to notice the reactions of the kids that learned the secret to this Magic Card Story as they preformed it in front of people. It was then and I knew I was on to something. That sparkle in the eyes of kids that preformed the trick ignighted something I missed in my childhood = Recognition, acknowledgement, attention. It also improves memory, concentration and raises self confidence and self worth.</p>
<p>  Getting this book in the hands of kids around the world has the potential of preventing the suffering I went through for many years, the suffering of not being true to myself, looking for the recognition I did not receive, thinking I did not fit in. All because of something that was said to them from a person who was not being responsible for their words having power.                                   <strong>  </strong><span class=""image-wrapper current"" style=""""><a class=""advance-link"" href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/children-s-creative-self-expression-being-stifled/x/2643262?c=gallery#1"" rel=""history noopener nofollow"" title=""The Wizard of Wishes""><br/></a></span><strong> </strong></p>

<p>   After finishing that book I received a delightful gift on my 60th birthday that would have a profound effect on my life. I received a visit from a friend who asked me what I wanted to do on my birthday. I responded with, “I want to write another book.” Little did I know the power in those words at that time. I fought the excuses, yet I drove to a lake, found a shady spot and settled in with my notebook and my favorite pen.</p>
<p><br/>                <strong>This is where the focus of my campaign 'began' to show up.</strong><br/><br/>  It was then that Izy, my muse, abruptly came into my life. He was an audacious Idea whose time had come and he would not be denied. As I sat attempting to find a title for this book, he popped into my head appearing as a little light bulb saying, “Vic, I have a gift for you. If you will listen and write down what I have to say, I will grant you your birthday wish.” Well, I did write down what he had to say and it became the book, <strong>“Victims of the Voice.”</strong> When I returned home he appeared again, along with a few of his friends, telling me I had to learn from a few lesson in life, before I could present this book to the public. Years passed.</p>
<p>                                      <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/744289/pictures/full/20130407114856-Print.jpg?1365632592"" src="""" style=""""/>                                  <br/>  This story was to become the answer to finding the cause of the fear and as Izy coached me through those lessons I got rid of the fear of expressing my True Self and began to experience the power of my own true voice, eliminating the victim I had become.  Once the fear was gone I began to realize what Izy had given me. It was the missing link, the one thing I could not discover on my own. It came with a great responsibility and I was ready to take it on.<br/><br/>    Then what showed up was Indiegogo. A friend mentioned I might find what I was looking for here. A place to ask for support in getting this book in the hands of those who suffer the powerless feeling of life dragging them along, having no power, no voice, no say about how their life turned out.  So, I began to comprise this request, asking for your support for those suffering from becoming <strong>“Victims of the Voice.”</strong>  </p>
<p>                                                     <strong>The Secret.</strong></p>
<p>  The power to overcome this voice that caused the victimization is located in plain sight, when used in multiplies and it is unlimited. It has the power to disappear and to manifest, is acquired by recognition and appropriation. The best part of this gift we are all give at birth is that it is <strong>Free.</strong> Once recognized and put to use it changes lives and rids the person of suffering from the fear of true self-expression, among many other fears and negative experiences.  With some practice it gives you control over your own life, also giving you a say in the matter of your future experiences. As your self worth and self confidence increases you begin to experience your ability to choose for yourself, therefore altering your view of life.  </p>
<p> This voice, the one that says, “what voice” is the cause of many, many issues people deal with in their daily lives. Once recognized it can be tamed and eventually it becomes quiet allowing you to <strong>generate</strong> self-confidence, laughter, joy, self worth and power over your own life.     </p>
<p><strong>                                My mission statement is as follows.</strong></p>
<p>  I intend to make this book available at a reduced cost, and if needed it will be given away for free. I am not in a position to carry those costs, so this is where I am asking you to join me in demystifying this injustice, therefore exposing the truth and increasing awareness by revealing the cause of the fear, the damage it causes, and the cure.  <br/><br/>   I will intend to give talks to promote the book, speaking of its value to demystify, not fix to issues, now that my fear is gone. I also intend to be on the radio in the future, sharing the secret I discovered when Izy came to visit me and helped me write this book. </p>
<p> <br/>  My next project it to create a ‘CD’ of “The Victims of the Voice,” intending to offer it at a discounted cost also, to those in need. This project will begin in June-July. After thatI am going to pitch Izy, the Idea  {The premise} to be turned into a movie.</p>
<p>  I would appreciate, those of you that view this page, any noise you make. Any links to contacts that would assist this campaign in becoming bigger than even I can imagine. Unnecessary suffering is running rampant throughout the world and all it takes is enough people to say, ""Enough!"" We have been conned into believing we are Victims of the Voice! We are not!!!!!!</p>

<p><br/>   For those who have been dragged along and experienced being at the mercy of this fear of expressing your <strong>True Self</strong>, or any other fear.

<ul>
<li>The book's title is <i>Dads of Disability:
Stories for, by, and about Fathers of Children that Experience Disability</i>
</li>
<li>Stories are written by me, other
fathers, mothers, and others. The book includes some poetry and 
micro-stories. The focus is on specific situations, storytelling, and 
lessons seen through the eyes of or
written for or through the filter of a father or male caregiver.</li>
<li>
The book will help fathers feel less alone, spur
conversations with peers, significant others, and families.
</li>
<li>The least expensive perk is a $9 DRM-free PDF file of the book when it is released.
</li>
<li>Although the book is ""for"" Dads it is also for the Moms and women that love those Dads.</li>
<li>Funds needed for production costs, writer stipends, awareness and marketing (mailings, podcast and blog sponsorships, PR, possible conference and travel expenses, etc.)<br/>

should be about the child. And to best focus on the individual with a disability,
fathers need to learn a lot. There are a lot of feelings to understand and
process after diagnosis as well as throughout life's milestones.<p></p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if dads had a source where they could read father-specific
stories to learn that their feelings and experiences are shared with other fathers? That they are not alone?</p>

<i><b>What this book is about:</b></i> This book is about specific situations and experiences told in such a way that
new fathers, experienced fathers, and those that love and support them can
learn.  Or maybe even provide family discussion topics. The book will contain micro-stories,
essays from ~500 to ~2500 words, and a few poems from the poetry contest judged
by <a href=""http://blog.dadsofdisability.com/poetry-contest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">poet and author Marly Youmans</a><a href=""http://blog.dadsofdisability.com/poetry-contest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://blog.dadsofdisability.com/poetry-contest"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://thepalaceat2.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Keep and eye on the main project page to learn more about how the topics are shaping up. </p>
<p><i><b>What this book isn't about:</b></i>  This book is not a full-length, first-person inspirational narrative about a
particular individual or family or a specific disability. There are a lot of
great books like that already out there! It is not a practical handbook about services and
systems. It isn’t a gripe session about the way the world should be. It isn’t a
reference book.</p>
<p><i><b>Is this book for women too?</b></i> Yes. This book
is for men, but it is also for women who would like to read about male perspectives and
gain additional insights into understanding and communicating with the dads and
male caregivers in their lives.</p>
<p>The content usually delivered by 
support systems for families like ours rarely addresses fathers in very 
much detail--or at all. One only need look at most blogs and books to
see the majority of support content is targeted at moms and females. 
This book attempts to address that shortcoming.</p>

<b><i>What will the funds raised be used for?</i></b> The funding will be
used to locate and pay <b>stipends </b>to essay and poem contributors, to
complete the <b>editing and production</b> of the book and ebooks including
design, getting files ready, and the expenses incurred in self publishing. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The financial target for this project is conservative -- <b>it will
not cover the full costs of creating and marketing this whole project.</b> My
hope is that you’ll share this project far and wide and we can exceed the

A book of stories for, by, and about fathers of children that experience  disability. (And the women who love them.) 
Get your free three-story preview with this link!
Visit the full project website 
at www.dadsofdisability.com





The book's title is Dads of Disability:
Stories for, by, and about Fathers of Children that Experience Disability

Stories are written by me, other
fathers, mothers, and others. The book includes some poetry and 
micro-stories. The focus is on specific situations, storytelling, and 
lessons seen through the eyes of or
written for or through the filter of a father or male caregiver.

The book will help fathers feel less alone, spur
conversations with peers, significant others, and families.

The least expensive perk is a $9 DRM-free PDF file of the book when it is released.

Although the book is ""for"" Dads it is also for the Moms and women that love those Dads.
Funds needed for production costs, writer stipends, awareness and marketing (mailings, podcast and blog sponsorships, PR, possible conference and travel expenses, etc.)

I am actively looking for essay and poem contributors! Read on...




The first concern
should be about the child. And to best focus on the individual with a disability,
fathers need to learn a lot. There are a lot of feelings to understand and
process after diagnosis as well as throughout life's milestones.
Wouldn’t it be nice if dads had a source where they could read father-specific
stories to learn that their feelings and experiences are shared with other fathers? That they are not alone?


What this book is about: This book is about specific situations and experiences told in such a way that
new fathers, experienced fathers, and those that love and support them can
learn.  Or maybe even provide family discussion topics. The book will contain micro-stories,
essays from ~500 to ~2500 words, and a few poems from the poetry contest judged
by poet and author Marly Youmans

Keep and eye on the main project page to learn more about how the topics are shaping up. 
What this book isn't about:  This book is not a full-length, first-person inspirational narrative about a
particular individual or family or a specific disability. There are a lot of
great books like that already out there! It is not a practical handbook about services and
systems. It isn’t a gripe session about the way the world should be. It isn’t a
reference book.
Is this book for women too? Yes. This book
is for men, but it is also for women who would like to read about male perspectives and
gain additional insights into understanding and communicating with the dads and
male caregivers in their lives.
The content usually delivered by 
support systems for families like ours rarely addresses fathers in very 
much detail--or at all. One only need look at most blogs and books to
see the majority of support content is targeted at moms and females. 
This book attempts to address that shortcoming.


What will the funds raised be used for? The funding will be
used to locate and pay stipends to essay and poem contributors, to
complete the editing and production of the book and ebooks including
design, getting files ready, and the expenses incurred in self publishing. 

The financial target for this project is conservative -- it will
not cover the full costs of creating and marketing this whole project. My
hope is that you’ll share this project far and wide and we can exceed the
conservative target.




Story submissions are still open.You can learn about the themes and desired approach and the submission guidelines here. While I seek all fathers (and their supporters) stories, I urge fathers of color, older dads, military
dads, dads who have disabilities themselves--basically a wide range of fathers
whose child of any age experiences a disability--to submit an essay or idea.



Hi.  I'm Gary. Darned pleased to meet you.  In different phases of my
 life I have been variously known as a son, musician, a special needs 
camp counselor, a computer dude, a tech writer, a product and marketing 
manager, and an entrepreneur.  But my most important and rewarding and 
enduring role is as a Dad. 
You can learn more about me on my marketing site at www.garydietz.com and of course at the www.dadsofdisability.com
 web site. I'm a hardworking optimist. My goal in this project is to 
help other dads, and if I am lucky, not end up in the hole -- or maybe 
even with a few extra bucks -- after the project is complete. 


Casey Silvestri is a recently graduated high school student, and soon to be
college student in an animation program.  Casey graduated the same high school as I did
exactly 30 years after me. I happen to think she is going to be
famous.  You should buy the perk of her artwork from her video and get in on the ground floor!
I wrote the 
script and and recorded the voiceovers. Casey created the animation.  We
 worked together to edit and critique and it was very much a 
collaboration.  She was very fun to work with. 
Please note:  This project is a book and a website.  This is not a movie or animation project. At this point, the animation is only for the marketing of this project.


Those that think that this book will minimize individuals with disabilities,
people-first language critics who may object to the title, those who question
the project's ""dad focus"", those who were troubled by the intro video
subjects and approach, and other naysayers please read main project’s website's FAQ and submission guidelines FAQ. Or maybe submit an essay yourself. This book
won't be perfect, but it will attempt to empower all constituencies even though it is focused on dads.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Me llamo Sara Godoy y descubrí mi pasión por la poesía casi por accidente a los 11 años aproximadamente. Estudié educación infantil y trabaje unos 11 años como educadora en escuelas infantiles. Pero mi interés por los cuentos comenzó realmente cuando empecé a trabajar en una librería y haciendo talleres de cuenta cuentos. Entonces descubrí el efecto mágico que tienen sobre los niños y niñas que los escuchan. Aunque<strong> lo que realmente me interesó es el efecto que tienen sobre los adultos...</strong> Así comencé a crear talleres de cuento-terapia y a guiar a las personas que acudían, a resolver conflictos del pasado, incluso de la infancia, transformando  esas experiencias en cuentos y <strong>regalándose el final más maravilloso y completo que pudieran imaginar. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">¡Así me enamoré de los cuentos y sus efectos mágicos!</p>

</div><p> </p><p>                                                                                     Sara Godoy</p></div>","Me presento!

Me llamo Sara Godoy y descubrí mi pasión por la poesía casi por accidente a los 11 años aproximadamente. Estudié educación infantil y trabaje unos 11 años como educadora en escuelas infantiles. Pero mi interés por los cuentos comenzó realmente cuando empecé a trabajar en una librería y haciendo talleres de cuenta cuentos. Entonces descubrí el efecto mágico que tienen sobre los niños y niñas que los escuchan. Aunque lo que realmente me interesó es el efecto que tienen sobre los adultos... Así comencé a crear talleres de cuento-terapia y a guiar a las personas que acudían, a resolver conflictos del pasado, incluso de la infancia, transformando  esas experiencias en cuentos y regalándose el final más maravilloso y completo que pudieran imaginar. 
¡Así me enamoré de los cuentos y sus efectos mágicos!
Este es el primero de mis cuentos que va a ser publicado y, no por casualidad, sino porque es el más especial de todos ellos, es el único que me ha enseñado que todo es cuestión de actitud, que no basta con querer, hay que CREER  y que no pasa nada si una necesita un poquito de ayuda, al contrario ,compartir con otros lo que se hace con amor es el mejor regalo que se puede hacer una a sí misma.
 

 
No es solo un cuento...
 También es un proyecto solidario dirigido a la investigación del cáncer. Donaré una parte de los beneficios obtenidos a la  FUNDACIÓN JOSEP CARRERAS CONTRA LA LEUCEMIA.
Su gran labor, esfuerzo y superación me inspiró y animó a querer formar parte se su labor. Y puesto que este cuento nace de una experiencia cercana y contada en primera persona, supe que tenía que formar parte de esta aventura.
La Fundación Josep Carreras colaborará junto con la editorial Babidi-bu y conmigo misma en la difusión y la venta de este maravilloso proyecto en el que os invito a colaborar.
 

   ¿Qué me motivó a escribir esta historia?
           Escribo cuentos metafóricos desde hace años, con el fin de ayudar a conocernos mejor y a respetar cada experiencia de vida como una lección de oro.
Hace un par de años conocí un caso cercano de cáncer infantil y necesité escribir este cuento al igual que necesité hacer algo al respecto, poner mi granito de arena y compartir esta historia con el mundo .
           La suerte no existe, ni buena ni mala, somos responsables de como nos tomamos las experiencias y de lo que somos capaces de aprender de ellas. Esa es la filosofía de nuestra protagonista. De ese modo Niké decide aferrarse  a la lección que le brinda la vida y crecer, madurar y compartir lo que ella ha aprendido.
                                             
         Es una historia escrita en verso, inspiradora para grandes y pequeños que anima a cambiar la perspectiva de las dificultades del camino desde el amor y la actitud positiva que a veces olvidamos que tenemos.
         Tanto los problemas que nos derriban como los pequeños inconvenientes del día a día dependen siempre de como nos los queramos tomar. Con el ejemplo de Niké ayudaremos a todos los lectores y oyentes a controlar las emociones y sacar siempre el mejor partido de cualquier situación.
            Os animo a colaborar para que se haga realidad este gran proyecto y podamos hacer que cada lector u oyente despierte (si es que no lo ha hecho ya) a esa Niké que aguarda en su interior.
 
Un pequeño avance de Niké, la guerrera valiente.
Una niña que juega tranquilamente en casa, empieza a encontrarse mal. Sus padres la llevan al medico y pronto ingresa en un hospital. Aunque ella esta cansada, todo parece transcurrir con normalidad, hasta que de pronto ... un humo blanco la rodea y una voz que parecía conocerla bien y la esperaba con impaciencia, le explica la verdadera razón por la que esta niña se encuentra allí.
Todos tienen sus esperanzas puestas en ella, y necesitan de su valor y coraje para que su mundo no termine para siempre.

¿De dónde viene el nombre de nuestra protagonista, Niké?
 Elegí este nombre de guerra para nuestra protagonista porque es el de la Diosa Griega de el valor y la victoria. Una pequeña mujer alada y requerida por todos los Dioses del Olimpo para vencer en sus batallas.
Me resultó verdaderamente inspirador que un ser mágico, pequeño y valiente fuera quien diera nombre a una niña que lucha con la mejor actitud y sin plantearse la derrota.

 
¿Por qué colaborar en esta campaña?
Para hacer grande lo pequeño, para hacer importante lo insignificante, porque una idea o una ilusión pueda ser la diferencia entre una vida o millones de ellas, y también, porque es un cuento precioso, alegre y divertido que sabe dar a cada Ser lo que necesite sin que se lo tenga que pedir.
Porque me ayudaréis a mi, una escritora algo asustada, a que me lance al fin al abismo y deje los miedos en casa. Porque podré compartir con el mundo lo que mas me gusta hacer y podré rescatar a mi propia Niké de la infancia, donde hace demasiado tiempo la dejé olvidada...

""These are stories that need to be heard"" — audience member at Mizna's Twin Cities Film Festival



Who We Are
We are Mizna! A forum for Arab American film, literature, and art. With you as our partner, we have been able to provide a space for artists, writers, filmmakers, and other creatives doing cutting edge work for over 15 years. The work we present fills a critical need in our cultural landscape—a space for Arab artists to tell their own stories, to write back against a cultural and political climate that seeks to define and vilify Arabs and Muslims.




About This Project
Mizna’s work has been gaining national attention, and we’ve recently received funding from the Knight Foundation's Knight Arts Challenge for our upcoming project Arab America at Home. 

This project will bring incredible authors, films, and arts events into unexpected places in St. Paul with:




a world-class photography exhibition from renowned artist Osama Esid, Still / Life / Syria, a portraiture project from the Syrian refugee camp in Adana, Turkey, presented with the conviction that, in time, there will still be life for Syria.




POETRY PICNIC & OUTDOOR FILM SCREENING on August 19 in Mears Park. We'll celebrate the release of the summer issue of Mizna and watch May in the Summer by Cherien Dabis under the stars.




READINGS from incredible Arab American authors including Pulitzer-nominated novelist Laila Lalami. Laila was nominated for the Pulitzer for her gorgeous novel The Moor's Crossing, and we were lucky enough to have published her work in our literary journal, Mizna.





Mizna's Twin Cities Arab Film Festival, November 5–8. The festival will be held at the St. Anthony Main Theatre and will close at the beautiful Walker Art Center. 




And (if you can believe it) much more!





What We Need & What You Get 
This funding from Knight is a Challenge Grant, and
we were tasked with raising a matching $40,000 in order to receive the Knight
dollars. We have already secured $25,000 from generous individuals and foundations,
but WE MUST RAISE AN ADDITIONAL $15,000
BY JULY 15! We are working to raise half of that through this IndieGoGo campaign's goal of $7500, and half through a simultaneous check-writing campaign.


To thank you for your generous donation, we have a number of thank you gifts to choose from at different levels, including Arab Street art stencil posters, a portrait sitting with renowned Osama Esid, and cooking alongside incredible chef of Saffron Restaurant, Sameh Wadi. Read through all the perks on the right!





    Risks & Challenges
This is a Challenge Grant from the Knight Foundation, which means Mizna has the opportunity 
and the challenge of raising $15,000 by July 15 ($7500 through this IndieGoGo campaign). If we do not reach this goal together Mizna will have to cancel our upcoming St. Paul events, and no one wants that to happen!

Also keep in mind when supporting Mizna that your contribution is a tax-deductible. 



Other Ways You Can Help



Get the word out to your friends! Can you get 10 people in your circle to support Mizna? Use e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, and other means to get your community engaged and excited! We have a month to reach this goal, and we can't (and don't want to) do it without you!

Thank you for being a part of our
vision.",5.0,1,"3 Campaigns

Summary
The Qu'ran, many believe, is the greatest book in existence.
There has been for centuries investigations into the links between science and religion, especially now with modern discoveries in quantum physics which has almost linked the two fields. 
Originally inspired by the writings of Sheikh Hisham Kabbani, this is the first book for young people on the subject with exciting illustrations and straightforward commentary encouraging children to think for themselves and to contemplate the creation around them. To have the fascination that mystics and scientists have had since the beginning of civilisation, which drives on new fields of discovery, both inner and outer, personally and globally.

Each book is produced when ordered which means there is no initial large layout of funds.

<p>The Bright Green Co-Editors</p></div>","Bright Green is one of the UK's leading left-wing blogs, publishing news and comment on green politics and social movements since January 2010.Next year presents exciting elections for Green Parties across the UK, and we need your help to publish quality independent coverage of these campaigns, as well as to continue to provide a platform for discussion of the broader future of green and progressive politics in the UK and Europe.We are aiming to raise £2000 over the next month to cover our costs including travel, publicity, printing, and our website, and would appreciate any contribution to help us meet these costs. And whether or not you can contribute, it would be fantastic if you could help us spread the word!After 2015 brought the Green Surge and the
best-ever Westminster result for the Greens, 2016 presents a number of key opportunities for Green Parties across the UK, with several critical elections
all taking place on 5th May:

In London, the Greens hope to add to their two seats on the London
Assembly and run a strong campaign in the Mayoral election, mobilising support
and highlighting the Green Party’s radical vision for London

The Scottish Greens look set to increase their representation in
Holyrood from two MSPs to eight or more, representing every region of Scotland,
and working to hold the SNP to account

The Welsh Greens seek to make a breakthrough in the Senedd, gaining their first one or two Assembly Members

The Green Party of Northern Ireland are in a good position to add to their one Assembly Member, in a region where Green politics is valuable in bringing together divided communities

In Bristol, Liverpool and Sheffield, Greens are set to make gains in local elections and headway in mayoral elections, increasing the possibility of Green MPs in those cities in 2020

Bright Green hopes to play our part in this vital year for Greens across the UK, publishing high-quality, original, independent
coverage of these elections in the six months leading up to 5th May,
including breaking news from the campaigns and interviews with Green candidates
across the UK.
Beyond the elections, we also seek to
provide a platform to discuss the broader future of the green politics and
social movements throughout the UK and Europe, and bring together some of the
best green thinking under one roof to expand people’s vision of what is
possible in politics. We will continue publishing articles on topics ranging from the need for electoral reform to the current refugee crisis, from why Scottish Young Greens threw a tea party for the Queen to what Young Greens can do to help the student movement.
But we need your help to do this.
As we grow and expand our coverage in this
crucial moment for the Greens, there are various costs we will have to meet:


Travel costs—to help our correspondents
attend and cover various events and local campaigns (£600 will pay for 15 round-trip train tickets at £40 each), as
well as organising a strategy weekend to bring together members of the team to
plan our long-term strategy (up to £600
to bring together our editors and correspondents from across the UK)


Publicity costs—to bring our articles to more people than ever before (£300 will bring 30 of our best articles
over the next year to tens of thousands more people through sponsored posts on
social media)


Printing costs—to provide exclusive Bright
Green newssheets at Green Party conferences (£300
will allow us to print hundreds of copies for each conference—both Green Party
of England and Wales and Scottish Green Party)


And finally, the costs of
keeping the website up and running (coming out to around £150)


In order to meet these costs we will face
over the next year, we are running this crowdfunder, aiming to raise £2000 in one
month.
However much you can donate, your contribution would be greatly appreciated, and will help us provide more and better Green journalism. Even if you can't contribute anything, it would be fantastic if you could spread the word over social media and in your local activist group or Green Party branch.
Thank you very much,

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>My name is Tania L Ramos, recovery room nurse turned part-time author and entrepreneur.  I have written two books and one manual.  My second book was self-published and has won two awards to date.  The manual is titled <em>Surviving the Writing Apocalypse: Content Help for New Authors</em>.  The website I am fundraising for is based off the manual.</p>
<p>     I have found over years of reading self-published books that many are substandard and published haphazardly.  This has given the self-publishing community of authors a bad name.  The purpose of writing the manual was to give authors, with little resources or finances, a comprehensive glimpse into some of the critical areas of writing where many mistakes are made. Areas such as foresight, author intrusion, period based themes, branding, and use of dialogue tags for example, are listed in the book.</p>
<p>     After writing the manual, my friend and I agreed there was so much more to contribute.  As a new self-published author it was time consuming to research many sites, compile the information, figure it all out, and put it into action.  With the manual in place, we decided it would be a great resource to add an accompanying website loaded with all the information a new author would need in one easy to navigate website.</p>
<p>    The website will include a page detailing the book, events, and social media revolving around it.  The site will also have a resource page with links to web designers, cover artists, editors, publicists, video media editors, beta-readers, and more.  The biggest feature, and the one we feel deeply about, is a page titled, ""Writing Apocalypse Survivors."" This page will feature submitted books which raise and exceed the bar for self-published material. A page where these wonderful books can be displayed, and where readers seeking to find top notch indie books can locate them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds we need are both for the manual and the website.  This is a list of what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicity for the manual and website</li>
<li>Purchase of a domain and server site</li>
<li>Purchase of booking application</li>
<li>Ability to put the book out in physical print (we have already started work in ereader formats)</li>
<li>Commercial time with ads on Facebook, YouTube, and Google ads</li>
<li>Bookstubs to advertise</li>
<li>A webinar campaign to increase clients</li>
</ul>
<p>The Perks (based on contribution):</p>
<ul>
<li>One free, signed book stub with download to many ereader apps</li>
<li>Free 30 min consultation, or consultation you can gift to a freind</li>
<li>A beautiful website dedicated to improving indie books</li>
<li>Your publishing related business listed for one month as a contributor on our home page, then listed free for the rest of the year on our resources page with link</li>
<li>A beautiful website and business you had a hand in putting together. And we love you for it!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    The website will not only target readers, but small publishing related businesses, as well as authors.  There are a few websites out there that boast that they display great indie books, but no one website we have come across offers more resources.  This is what we will offer on the site:</p>
<ul>
<li>30 minute &amp; 1 hour phone consultations for authors needing one-on-one help</li>
<li>3 chapter or 30 page review. This is where an author can submit their first three chapters or thirty pages (whichever is shorter), for content review at a price much cheaper than traditional editing</li>
<li>A page dedicated to books that have exceeded a minimum standard</li>
<li>A page with resources such as downloads of form sheets</li>
<li>A page with outside resources such as editing, cover design, and more</li>
<li>A manual available for purchase at a reasonable price</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    We realize times are hard all around the world, and we appreciate any financial help you can offer.  However, if you can not help financially there are many other ways to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>spread the word about our campaign by linking it into your social media</li>
<li>become a beta-reader</li>
<li>and most importantly, tell your friends about <em>Surviving the Writing Apocalypse</em>
</li>

<p><strong>Update (April 2017): Order your copy of<i> Lost Guides - Singapore</i> on my website <a href=""http://thelostguides.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>! </strong></p>
<p>Hello! I’m Anna and I’m the author, photographer and explorer behind this book <i>Lost Guides – Singapore</i>. A few years ago I turned up to this city and didn’t have a clue where to go, and spent way too much time in the wrong places! I’ve since been digging up local and authentic spots, finding great food, and discovering creative neighbourhoods. I’m now using this book to share with you all that is awesome about Singapore, and to help you have an amazing time here!</p>

<h3>What’s in the guide?</h3>
<p>This book highlights 120 of the most special spots in Singapore where I love to spend my time. Recommendations include cool coffee shops, authentic Asian art galleries, fabulous food (both local and contemporary), speakeasy bars and boutique hotels. Designed to be practical and useful, this book is organised into 10 neighbourhoods, with bespoke maps and original photography to give you all the information that you need.</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>I’ve also been speaking to some of the most inspirational local creatives, who have given me in-depth interviews, and some of Singapore's most promising writers have contributed beautiful pieces of literature about this little island.</p>

<h3>What stage am I at?</h3>
<p>You'll be happy to know that all the groundwork has been done! All the spots that have made it into the book have been decided and I've organised all the photography as well as conducted interviews and collected written contributions. </p>
<p>I'm now working with some amazingly talented designers that specialise in creating lovely independent books. The aim is to create a beautiful book for you, something that you'd happily display in your home or give as a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>18<sup>th</sup> Jan - Launch the crowdfunding campaign</p>
<p>13<sup>th</sup> Feb - End of crowdfunding campaign</p>
<p>Feb – March – Finalise text, design and layout</p>
<p>March - Send to the printers</p>
<p>End of March - Pick up your books at the launch event! Books &amp; rewards are shipped</p>
<h3>What will the money be used for?</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise a minimum of <strong>$5000 USD</strong>. This will be going straight into printing costs as well as getting the rewards out to you. The biggest barrier to getting a book published is the printing costs with most printing companies requiring high minimum orders. Additional funds will also go towards the book design and layout. I've specifically tracked down and chosen the most talented book designers to work with me on this project so I can give you the best possible final product!</p>
<h3><strong>About Lost Guides</strong></h3>
<p>I founded my travel website <a href=""http://thelostguides.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thelostguides.com</a> in 2014 as I was frustrated with the lack of useful and trustworthy information about the places I wanted to visit. I now use this space to share unique and inspiring travel experiences for Asia with the aim of making your travel planning that little bit easier!</p>
<p>In November 2015 I launched my first book <i>Lost Guides – Bali</i> (through crowdfunding), which has since gone on to sell thousands of copies in its first year. <i>Lost Guides - Bali</i> is stocked in some awesome places like Books Actually in Singapore, Stanfords in London, and Periplus in Indonesia. It even made its way to Nordstrom in USA for a pop-up.</p>

</div></div>","Update (April 2017): Order your copy of Lost Guides - Singapore on my website here! 
Hello! I’m Anna and I’m the author, photographer and explorer behind this book Lost Guides – Singapore. A few years ago I turned up to this city and didn’t have a clue where to go, and spent way too much time in the wrong places! I’ve since been digging up local and authentic spots, finding great food, and discovering creative neighbourhoods. I’m now using this book to share with you all that is awesome about Singapore, and to help you have an amazing time here!

What’s in the guide?
This book highlights 120 of the most special spots in Singapore where I love to spend my time. Recommendations include cool coffee shops, authentic Asian art galleries, fabulous food (both local and contemporary), speakeasy bars and boutique hotels. Designed to be practical and useful, this book is organised into 10 neighbourhoods, with bespoke maps and original photography to give you all the information that you need.

I’ve also been speaking to some of the most inspirational local creatives, who have given me in-depth interviews, and some of Singapore's most promising writers have contributed beautiful pieces of literature about this little island.
Details

A5, full colour 182 page soft cover book
Original photography
Hand-drawn maps of the neighbourhoods and illustrations
Offset-printed and perfect bound

View in high res here.






What stage am I at?
You'll be happy to know that all the groundwork has been done! All the spots that have made it into the book have been decided and I've organised all the photography as well as conducted interviews and collected written contributions. 
I'm now working with some amazingly talented designers that specialise in creating lovely independent books. The aim is to create a beautiful book for you, something that you'd happily display in your home or give as a gift.
Timeline
18th Jan - Launch the crowdfunding campaign
13th Feb - End of crowdfunding campaign
Feb – March – Finalise text, design and layout
March - Send to the printers
End of March - Pick up your books at the launch event! Books & rewards are shipped
What will the money be used for?
I'm looking to raise a minimum of $5000 USD. This will be going straight into printing costs as well as getting the rewards out to you. The biggest barrier to getting a book published is the printing costs with most printing companies requiring high minimum orders. Additional funds will also go towards the book design and layout. I've specifically tracked down and chosen the most talented book designers to work with me on this project so I can give you the best possible final product!
About Lost Guides
I founded my travel website thelostguides.com in 2014 as I was frustrated with the lack of useful and trustworthy information about the places I wanted to visit. I now use this space to share unique and inspiring travel experiences for Asia with the aim of making your travel planning that little bit easier!
In November 2015 I launched my first book Lost Guides – Bali (through crowdfunding), which has since gone on to sell thousands of copies in its first year. Lost Guides - Bali is stocked in some awesome places like Books Actually in Singapore, Stanfords in London, and Periplus in Indonesia. It even made its way to Nordstrom in USA for a pop-up.
Reviews of Lost Guides - Bali

My readers are AMAZING and often share their beautiful photos with me on their instagram during their travels.

<h3>More Than Just One Journal...</h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Ivy Page. I am the editor and founder of OVS Magazine. I started this journal after graduating from my MFA program as a way to stay connected with other poets and artists, and give those same poets and artists a peer reviewed journal that would help them get their work out in the world. </p>
<p>The AWP Conference is one of the largest writing conferences, and we would love to be able to fund having a table to display OVS Magazine and the artists and poets we have published.</p>
<p>By helping us fund this conference you will be helping every artist and poet in our journals reach a wider audience. We have been publishing since 2009, and have published both undiscovered and well-known artists and poets.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $500.00 to purchase the bookfair table, and an additional $500.00 for stickers, cards, and give-away material for those that stop by the table. Anything beyond that would go to having a reading/gallary show off-site for the people we publish to showcase their work.  This will hopefully be the next champaign!</p>
<p>We want to give you something in return...</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Announcing the Stories of Our Legacy</h2><p>The stories of the women in the bible have been hidden from the sight of Jewish women in this generation. Now there is a rising desire for access to the power of the women we have descended from. <i>Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors: The Legacy of the Jewish Woman</i> reveals the stories and teachings so you can discover these timeless stories for yourself and bring them into your life in concrete ways.</p><p>These are the stories that built a nation, and it's time to know them for ourselves. It's time to cash in on our inheritance!</p><p>I'm Laya Saul, author of this new book about timeless stories of the Jewish foremothers. Since I began my journey into the world of Torah, I have found truth after truth, wisdom and more wisdom. One of the teachings is about how women impact this world, how women will bring redemption to the world. Women! I'm so passionate about letting women know the power we have had in the past, the very foundation of our nation, and the power we have right now.</p><p>I want women (and men!) to know these stories, to honor themselves, to know the truth. Each one of us is a candle that chases away the darkness. By getting this book to print in a big way, by getting this knowledge into women's hands, we can ignite more light within ourselves and others.</p><p>I have been teaching the topic of women in Torah internationally for over ten years. With a master's degree in psychology, I have also focused on filling this book with lessons that can have a major positive impact on the quality of our lives. This is not just a book, it's a treasure map.</p><p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here's the breakdown of how we'll use the money:</p><p>The funding through this campaign covers the high-quality production of this book: Superb editing and source referencing, cover art, interior layout, indexing, and printing costs.  We did not hold back on bringing this book to excellence!</p><p>Your participation gets you more than just ink on a page. It's timeless wisdom, something you can grow with and give to others. Check out the unique copper mirror pendant especially designed by artist Tzipora Hoynik, whose jewelry has been on exhibit in the Smithsonian. There are opportunities to get this book into the hands of Jewish women who might not otherwise find it on their own through campuses and outreach.</p><p>If we reach and surpass the goal, I'll be your emissary to spread the light and get this book into even more hands!</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your contribution gets you more than a book. Statistics show that one book is read by multiple people. The light of your candle ignights the wicks of other candles.</p><p>The time has come for this generation to know the truth about our own foremothers and learn from both their mistakes and their strengths.</p><p>My self-help book for teens went to print fifteen years ago. It's still selling and still impacting lives for the good.</p><p>Here's a chance for you to truly be a link in the chain of the legacy of our nation.</p><h3>Advance Praise from Jewish Leaders</h3><p>""Laya Saul has written a book that will give today’s generation of Jewish women their rightful inheritance: the role models that reveal our legacy and illuminate our future.""</p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Lori Palatnik, Founding Director, Jewish Women’s Renaissance Project (JWRP)</p><p>""Accessible and inspiring. Laya Saul tells the epic stories of women of the Torah and brings to life the lessons and values of being a Jewish woman. I am happy to recommend and support such a wonderful book.""</p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Olivia Schwartz, co-director, Chai Center, Los Angeles</p><p>""Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is an in-depth exploration of fourteen of the most prominent women in the Hebrew Bible. By focusing on the eternal archetypes represented by each female character, Saul illuminates the spiritual lessons these strong women teach us—lessons that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. Saul writes in a clear, engaging manner, making this book accessible to all Jewish women, whether this is their first introduction to biblical heroines or they’ve been studying the material for years. Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is an entertaining book that is sure to inspire Jewish women of all ages and backgrounds.""</p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Nina Davidovich Litvak, screenwriter and co-creator, Accidental Talmudist</p><p>""Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is a marvelous foundational “family history” that mirrors the wisdom, power, and spiritual DNA of the Jewish woman.""</p><p style=""text-align: right;"">Adrienne Gold, Trip and Education Leader, Jewish Women’s Renaissance Project (JRWP)</p><h3>Why Copper Mirrors?</h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IRvrpVTIwA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>
<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>This is not technology—there's nothing to break. The book is written and edited. This campaign is about going to print, and it's a process I've done before. I did a campaign for a picture book for toddlers that is in print (in limited quantity for now). We can do this!</p><p>I suppose the most dramatic risk is that there is a delay in the process. That is not anticipated, and I will keep you posted.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Whether or not you can make a financial contribution, please:</p><p>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</p><p>You can use the Indiegogo share tools!</p><p>Copy and paste any part of this page with the URL and share with friends and family on social media or via email.</p><p>Say a little prayer or send me an encouraging word. It all makes a difference!<br/><br/>Thank you so much!</p><h3>About the Jeweler</h3><p>Tzipora Hoynik is a lifelong artist and jeweler who uses natural gemstones as the inspiration for her one of a kind jewelry designs.</p><p>For this project, Tzipora was inspired by some of the stories to create this fundraising piece.  Made of cast, lead-free pewter, dipped in copper, and then sealed, it is a reflection of the beauty in all of us.

Now there is a rising desire for access to the power of the women we have descended from. Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors: The Legacy of the Jewish Woman reveals the stories and teachings so you can discover these timeless stories for yourself and bring them into your life in concrete ways.These are the stories that built a nation, and it's time to know them for ourselves. It's time to cash in on our inheritance!I'm Laya Saul, author of this new book about timeless stories of the Jewish foremothers. Since I began my journey into the world of Torah, I have found truth after truth, wisdom and more wisdom. One of the teachings is about how women impact this world, how women will bring redemption to the world. Women! I'm so passionate about letting women know the power we have had in the past, the very foundation of our nation, and the power we have right now.I want women (and men!) to know these stories, to honor themselves, to know the truth. Each one of us is a candle that chases away the darkness. By getting this book to print in a big way, by getting this knowledge into women's hands, we can ignite more light within ourselves and others.I have been teaching the topic of women in Torah internationally for over ten years. With a master's degree in psychology, I have also focused on filling this book with lessons that can have a major positive impact on the quality of our lives. This is not just a book, it's a treasure map. What We Need & What You GetHere's the breakdown of how we'll use the money:The funding through this campaign covers the high-quality production of this book: Superb editing and source referencing, cover art, interior layout, indexing, and printing costs.  We did not hold back on bringing this book to excellence!Your participation gets you more than just ink on a page. It's timeless wisdom, something you can grow with and give to others. Check out the unique copper mirror pendant especially designed by artist Tzipora Hoynik, whose jewelry has been on exhibit in the Smithsonian. There are opportunities to get this book into the hands of Jewish women who might not otherwise find it on their own through campuses and outreach.If we reach and surpass the goal, I'll be your emissary to spread the light and get this book into even more hands!The ImpactYour contribution gets you more than a book. Statistics show that one book is read by multiple people. The light of your candle ignights the wicks of other candles.The time has come for this generation to know the truth about our own foremothers and learn from both their mistakes and their strengths.My self-help book for teens went to print fifteen years ago. It's still selling and still impacting lives for the good.Here's a chance for you to truly be a link in the chain of the legacy of our nation.Advance Praise from Jewish Leaders""Laya Saul has written a book that will give today’s generation of Jewish women their rightful inheritance: the role models that reveal our legacy and illuminate our future.""Lori Palatnik, Founding Director, Jewish Women’s Renaissance Project (JWRP)""Accessible and inspiring. Laya Saul tells the epic stories of women of the Torah and brings to life the lessons and values of being a Jewish woman. I am happy to recommend and support such a wonderful book.""Olivia Schwartz, co-director, Chai Center, Los Angeles""Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is an in-depth exploration of fourteen of the most prominent women in the Hebrew Bible. By focusing on the eternal archetypes represented by each female character, Saul illuminates the spiritual lessons these strong women teach us—lessons that are as relevant today as they were thousands of years ago. Saul writes in a clear, engaging manner, making this book accessible to all Jewish women, whether this is their first introduction to biblical heroines or they’ve been studying the material for years. Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is an entertaining book that is sure to inspire Jewish women of all ages and backgrounds.""Nina Davidovich Litvak, screenwriter and co-creator, Accidental Talmudist""Sisterhood of the Copper Mirrors is a marvelous foundational “family history” that mirrors the wisdom, power, and spiritual DNA of the Jewish woman.""Adrienne Gold, Trip and Education Leader, Jewish Women’s Renaissance Project (JRWP)Why Copper Mirrors?
Risks & ChallengesThis is not technology—there's nothing to break. The book is written and edited. This campaign is about going to print, and it's a process I've done before. I did a campaign for a picture book for toddlers that is in print (in limited quantity for now). We can do this!I suppose the most dramatic risk is that there is a delay in the process. That is not anticipated, and I will keep you posted.Other Ways You Can HelpWhether or not you can make a financial contribution, please:Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.You can use the Indiegogo share tools!Copy and paste any part of this page with the URL and share with friends and family on social media or via email.Say a little prayer or send me an encouraging word. It all makes a difference!Thank you so much!About the JewelerTzipora Hoynik is a lifelong artist and jeweler who uses natural gemstones as the inspiration for her one of a kind jewelry designs.For this project, Tzipora was inspired by some of the stories to create this fundraising piece.  Made of cast, lead-free pewter, dipped in copper, and then sealed, it is a reflection of the beauty in all of us. The leaves on the mirror represent the hadassah plant (myrtle). Hadassah was Queen Esther’s birth name.

Huntar Fischer is totally cool with that, but right now he's eighteen.  After all, he wants to find himself too.  He wants to find himself a major, a man and a fake id.  But the harder he tries to keep his superpower, scholastic, and sex lives apart, the more they insist on the one type of threesome Huntar can't handle.   

The Quarterlife Series follows Huntar and his friends’ journey over their college years, through battles, under covers, and around the world as he learns to accept who he really is, all the while dealing with toga parties and teleporting, finals and flight, soul mates and super strength. 
 
As with all heroic journeys Huntar’s begins with a choice, and the reader will be able to see what life is like on both sides of the fence.  This is merely part one.  Part Two, an alternative timeline to Part One will be released next autumn, which will complete the first volume of the Quarterlife Crises.


**the first chapisode of The Freshman Fifteen is available for download (for free)**
What's the Plan?
The Freshman Fifteen is structured into ten chapisodes that will be released from October until December, allowing us a two month period to spread the word and build momentum.  We are going to promote The Freshman Fifteen with a book tour disguised as homo-house party themed promotional events, such as beer pong competitions, masquerade parties, and storytelling nights in Madison, Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and a final location to be chosen by a donor ($1500+). In this project, we are exploring new ways of doing business, content generation, distribution, and promotion using internet grass-roots techniques.  All of this is to promote creativity and inspiration between various creative personalities (like bringing in other singers, storytellers, artists, etc. to promote the various communities that I'm proud to be a part of--friends, LGBT, storytellers, minority groups, and future communities I haven't met yet).  We are doing this by pushing ourselves to our limits and embracing the entrepreneurial spirit of the internet with only an author and a reader, no middlemen publishers (because that's the one kind of threesome I can't handle).   We believe that with a good book, hard work, and a knack for self-promotion, we can make our voices heard and change the world.

$pending & $WAG
We are seeking funding to be able to promote the book with a regional book tour.  By working with our connections in the service industry and other cities we have found ways to host awesome events on pretty tight budgets.  Our costs can be broken into three categories:





Travel costs (e.g. bus tickets [no high-speed rail in WI yet], food, incidental transportation, etc.).  Lodging will be provided by our dear friends in other cities.

Event costs: venues, and food/drink.
Promotional materials (i.e. ads, printed materials, SWAG).



 
We strived to offer interesting perks at each level of donation that are reflective of the book and of our gratitude for your support of The Freshman Fifteen.

<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
<p>For some time now, I’ve known that God has called me
to something far greater than myself. <span> </span>Over the past 14 years God has given me the honor to
preach His word. In November 2013, God gave me the vision to plant a Church.
This is not going to be an easy task but I’m confident that God will make a
way. </p>
<p>For almost 10 years I’ve had
the pleasure of serving on the ministerial staff at Mount Carmel Baptist Church
in Washington, DC. During this time, God has developed in me a huge passion for
ministering to His people. I feel that this has been one of the greatest
experiences – one in which I’ve grown in so many ways. </p>
<p>At Mount Carmel I was given
so many leadership opportunities. Over the years I’ve helped to start an after
school program for teens as well as a Sunday evening service for college
students and young adults. I’ve also partnered with the community to host
community events and forums. I had the opportunity to learn about radio by
helping the church expand their radio broadcast from one to ten cities. Mount
Carmel has been a place where I’ve truly seen the major role that a Church has
in the community. This has inspired me to do the same in Laurel, MD. </p>
<p><b>The Opportunity</b></p>
<p>There are over 9 million
people in the Baltimore – Washington, D.C area and Laurel sits in the middle of
both cities. With a large and growing business and residential population, this
is an ideal place for a new Church plant. With a large and diverse ethnic
population, we will not only be able to reach those locally within this
community, but we will also have the opportunity to reach and impact lives
around the world. With many young professionals moving to the area, this city
is in desperate need of a church that ministers to their needs. In order to
make the vision a reality we need the financial support of men and women who
want to make a difference with their lives and resources. Below is a detailed
break down of our plan and the resources needed to accomplish it.  It is my prayer that you will join with us to
help uplift minds, hearts and the spirits of God’s people.</p>

For some time now, I’ve known that God has called me
to something far greater than myself.  Over the past 14 years God has given me the honor to
preach His word. In November 2013, God gave me the vision to plant a Church.
This is not going to be an easy task but I’m confident that God will make a
way. 
For almost 10 years I’ve had
the pleasure of serving on the ministerial staff at Mount Carmel Baptist Church
in Washington, DC. During this time, God has developed in me a huge passion for
ministering to His people. I feel that this has been one of the greatest
experiences – one in which I’ve grown in so many ways. 
At Mount Carmel I was given
so many leadership opportunities. Over the years I’ve helped to start an after
school program for teens as well as a Sunday evening service for college
students and young adults. I’ve also partnered with the community to host
community events and forums. I had the opportunity to learn about radio by
helping the church expand their radio broadcast from one to ten cities. Mount
Carmel has been a place where I’ve truly seen the major role that a Church has
in the community. This has inspired me to do the same in Laurel, MD. 
The Opportunity
There are over 9 million
people in the Baltimore – Washington, D.C area and Laurel sits in the middle of
both cities. With a large and growing business and residential population, this
is an ideal place for a new Church plant. With a large and diverse ethnic
population, we will not only be able to reach those locally within this
community, but we will also have the opportunity to reach and impact lives
around the world. With many young professionals moving to the area, this city
is in desperate need of a church that ministers to their needs. In order to
make the vision a reality we need the financial support of men and women who
want to make a difference with their lives and resources. Below is a detailed
break down of our plan and the resources needed to accomplish it.  It is my prayer that you will join with us to
help uplift minds, hearts and the spirits of God’s people.

Christian truths through a medium of entertaining adventure. All of my currently
published books are in the realm of Christian self-help/devotionals. But as a
father, I wanted to write something for my children as they enter their teenage
years—something that would pull my boys into reading while providing me with an
opportunity to share biblical truths and concepts in a unique way.</p>
<p>Having read many different genres, I felt that the use of a
fantasy realm would provide me with the most varied, flexible, interesting, and
entertaining series of adventure novels…thus the Isle of the Phoenix was born. </p><p><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com/?show_post=22"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com/?show_post=22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read an excerpt here!</a></p>
<p>They are fast-paced novels that will draw young readers in
and captivate their imagination in an engaging manner while sharing lessons of
life that will prepare them for their own adventures. Each novel is a complete
story, though often laying the foundation for the novels yet to follow. The
novels will follow a wide variety of characters and their descendants to form
an in-depth world that a young imagination can blossom in a positive way. </p><p><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com/?show_post=27"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com/?show_post=27"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read another excerpt here!</a></p>
<p>This is an ambitious project. I anticipate writing dozens of
adventure novels attuned to the Isle of the Phoenix. But anyone who has ever
published a book knows how expensive it can get, so the purpose of this campaign
is to raise the necessary funds to get it published right—proper editing, art preparation,
publishing expenses, and marketing. </p>
<p>This isn’t just about my children. It’s about having clean
books absent all the sex, casual death, foul language, and humanistic philosophies—while
dealing with real issues of everyday life and promoting Christian values. These
books will be great for anyone—kids, teens, young adults, old fogies...everyone.
What we read has a huge impact on our thinking, our way of life, our understanding
of life, and our attitudes. Fiction is a perfect medium to positively affect
those ideals, strengthen our morals, and instill positive values.</p>

transformation every year upon the advent of the Phoenix’s Rebirth. Valleys can
appear where mountains once towered. Swamps can replace scorching desert.
Volcanoes can form where only trees once grew. Deep snow can be found where a
steaming tropical jungle once stood. The entire ecosystem and climate of the
island changes every year at the Rebirth. However, the general outline of the island
never changes.<p></p>
<p>The only things other things that do not change are human built
structures, but even these are only safe towards the coastline of the island.
Anything in the interior can find itself on a cliff one year and in a river the
next. The effect is not so dramatic towards the coastline, so most of the human
population lives there. Only creatures of the island live in the interior,
making the interior not only unmapable, but also incredibly dangerous.</p>
<p>There are two main population centers. The inhabitants of
Khol, the northern city, are typically followers of the Phoenix and those with
a Gift of the Phoenix serve as the public servants within the city. The
inhabitants of Taninim, the southern city, are typically worshipers of the
Dragon. Those with a Gift of the Dragon are rulers, often ruling dictatorially
and harshly. Around both cities can be found a scattering of villages and
farms.</p>
<p>A mysterious fog surrounds the island, preventing anyone
from leaving. Those who attempt it are never seen again, though the wreckage of
their ships are often found washed ashore. Occasionally, someone emerges from
the fog having entered it from the other side, became wrecked on the
treacherous reefs hidden within the fog, and is then washed ashore, marooned.</p>
Within the interior
of the island live a variety odd creatures that seem to have emerged from
folklore. Though their natures tend to remain consistent, their physiology
changes with each Rebirth. One year, a creature can be taller than a human and
the next year, no higher than the same human’s knees. Their overall appearance
remains the same, but they can be thinner, stockier, fatter, stronger, weaker, etc. than precious years. They are different than normal animals which, like
humans, don’t change from year to year. Some are very intelligent and some have
intelligence little better than animals. Regardless, they are special and can
be either helpful or incredibly dangerous if encountered. <br/><p></p><p>It is in this fantastical land that all the adventures take place. The map above is what the characters of the first book discover. The next book will have an entirely different map as the island will have changed.</p><p><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.isleofthephoenix.com</a><br/></p><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682066/files/20140629070413-Heading3.jpg?1404050653"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Everything in the book symbolizes some aspect of Christianity. This is not overtly stated in the actual novel, but anyone who tries to see the symbols will find them easily enough.</p><p>For example, the Phoenix is actually an ancient Christian symbol that depicted salvation and the new birth in Christ. In my book, the Phoenix symbolizes the Holy Spirit and the Gifts of the Phoenix represent the various gifts of the Spirit found in 1 Corinthians 12. The Dragon represents Satan and his ""gifts"" represent the three sources of sin: Lust of the Eyes, Lust of the Flesh, and the Pride of Life (1 John 2:16).</p><p>Each book has an overall theme that is represented by a Scripture verse at the very beginning of the book. For the first book, <i>The Phoenix Quest, </i>the theme deals with two intertwined themes: the problem with a bad reputation and bullying. It shows the difficulties of changing a bad reputation once you have it and issues surrounding bulling and friendships. The particular Scripture used is Proverbs 22:1. Every book will follow a similar theme straight out of the Bible.</p><p>Although these books are intended for teenagers and young adults, anyone, adult or otherwise, will benefit from seeing these Biblical truths illustrated in these fun-filled, clean adventures. The stories make for great discussions. </p><p><a href=""http://www.isleofthephoenix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.isleofthephoenix.com</a><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682083/files/20140629071601-Heading4.jpg?1404051361"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687856/files/20140701130251-BookCoverConcept7.jpg?1404244971"" src="""" style=""float: right; padding: 5px; width: 183.49655172413793px; height: 294px;""/></p>I think so. I absolutely loved writing the first one and I tested it out on two of my own children. One is nearly 13 and the other nearly 11. Both of them consumed the book. In fact, I have never seen my 11 year old so singly determined to read a book such as he did this one. As the author, I loved watching him read and read and read. It is written at about an 8th grade reading level, so he came to me on numerous occasions asking about what a particular word meant, but I figured he is still young enough that if he didn't like it, he would have gotten bored and wandered away--no matter if his daddy wrote it or not. <p></p><p>After he finished, we had a great discussion on the many lessons on the book. For me, this book is already a success. Both of my two oldest cannot wait for the second book to be finished. </p><p>My brother, in his 30's, and his wife both loved the book as well.  My brother said, ""This is probably the best book you've ever written."" He began reading a chapter each night to his own children. His oldest got impatient with that and wanted to read it on his own.</p><p>A teenager in our church who is not a reader by any stretch of the imagination has started reading it. He said, ""I like the story!"" His father likes it too.</p><p>Both of my parents have read the first book and these ""old fogies"" loved the adventure as well. My mother commented that it would make a great movie. My father is already tossing around ideas with me for the second book.

It shows the difficulties of changing a bad reputation once you have it and issues surrounding bulling and friendships. The particular Scripture used is Proverbs 22:1. Every book will follow a similar theme straight out of the Bible.Although these books are intended for teenagers and young adults, anyone, adult or otherwise, will benefit from seeing these Biblical truths illustrated in these fun-filled, clean adventures. The stories make for great discussions. www.isleofthephoenix.comI think so. I absolutely loved writing the first one and I tested it out on two of my own children. One is nearly 13 and the other nearly 11. Both of them consumed the book. In fact, I have never seen my 11 year old so singly determined to read a book such as he did this one. As the author, I loved watching him read and read and read. It is written at about an 8th grade reading level, so he came to me on numerous occasions asking about what a particular word meant, but I figured he is still young enough that if he didn't like it, he would have gotten bored and wandered away--no matter if his daddy wrote it or not. After he finished, we had a great discussion on the many lessons on the book. For me, this book is already a success. Both of my two oldest cannot wait for the second book to be finished. My brother, in his 30's, and his wife both loved the book as well.  My brother said, ""This is probably the best book you've ever written."" He began reading a chapter each night to his own children. His oldest got impatient with that and wanted to read it on his own.A teenager in our church who is not a reader by any stretch of the imagination has started reading it. He said, ""I like the story!"" His father likes it too.Both of my parents have read the first book and these ""old fogies"" loved the adventure as well. My mother commented that it would make a great movie. My father is already tossing around ideas with me for the second book. Both are avid readers and they felt the book is on par with many other well known authors.You can read excerpts of the book and explore the Isle of the Phoenix yourself by going to www.isleofthephoenix.com.The funds that are raised here will go for a variety of purposes:

<p><em>We All Become Stories</em> is a book about the experience of age and how memory changes as the years roll by. <a href=""http://bluedenimpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blue Denim Press</a> is publishing the book in the fall of 2013.  Blue Denim’s Shane Joseph and Sarah Jacobs are convinced that although old age is a scary topic to many, there are a plethora of readers who want to know what it’s really like to age – and to hear about it from older people themselves.  Perhaps you also want insights into how to care for the older people in your life, or to get ideas about how to think about your own old age. </p>
<p>We’ve all heard about the so-called tsunami-like impact of the aging population: the effects on the economy and the health care system, the rapidly depleting social safety net.  There’s plenty of information about what to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">do</span> about old age (and old people, as if they’re things!). We can learn about health and aging, sex and aging, memory “decline,” about the physical, emotional and social losses that come with aging, about how and where the elderly should live, and so on.</p>
<p>And we like hearing old people talk about the past: what they did in the war, family stories, about people they knew in the “good old day.” But we don’t hear them talking about their own experiences of aging. On that topic, something all of us will experience, their voices seem silenced. I gave voices to silenced women in <em>My Grandmother’s Hair</em> (Edgar Kent, 2005) and I wrote about the repression of those who draw our attention to the disappearance of so much of our natural world in <em>Shadow’s Light</em> (Longboat Alliance 2005) and in <em>The Risks of Remembrance</em> (Words Indeed Ltd, 2010).</p>
<h3>Conversation as Action</h3>
<p>As we <em>are</em> living in a time when the population is aging, it’s important to broaden the conversation, give a voice to the elderly and listen to what old people have to say about aging and old age.</p>
<p>That’s why I’d like <em>We All Become Stories</em> to reach as wide an audience as possible. To do that, my goal is to raise $7,500 – enough money to cover a broader range of promotional activities and expenses than was necessary to promote my earlier books.  Your support will help me cast a wider net and build a network of bloggers, writers and researchers who are interested in this topic.</p>

</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>Author JE Fletcher (Julie) has been supporting her family through
her writing income since 2005. Recently her chronic illness and a
legal problem concerning her work has reduced that income well below
the amount needed to continue to support her family and gain legal
help during this very stressful time.</p><div>
</div><p>Julie is being treated for an undetermined suspected autoimmune
disease.<i>( Her first visit to a rhuematologist is August 28</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
as previous treatment through her primary has been unable to
determine anything further than persistent hematuria (blood in urine)
from undetermined sources, and persistent vitamin deficiency  even
with supplementation. ) </i>Joints
in her hands become swollen and severely painful which limits her
ability to write. So much that her income has been slashed to the
point she is unable to continue to support her family or procure
legal counsel.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
<br/>
</div><div>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
<br/>
</div><h3>What She Needs &amp; What You Get</h3><div>
</div><p>Julie needs to get her family through this difficult time and hire
a lawyer as the legal aid in her area does not provide services in
literary or publishing. The family had to resort to applying for
public assistance which does not cover the needs of a family of seven
for a full month. The funds from the fundraiser will go toward:</p><div>
</div><p>Life/personal expenses such as grocery/bill/clothing/repair costs</p><div>
</div><p>Procurement of attorney services (initial counsel, travel to law
office or court if needed) and all fees.</p><div>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>The family needs to purchase a used vehicle as they live in a
rural area and there is no public transit and the cost of a taxi per
trip is prohibitive on their income. 
</p><div>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><p>What contributors get:</p><div>
</div><p>Eternal gratitude at every donation level, even just shares of the
link.</p><div>
</div><p>Every contributor of $50 or more will receive a signed print copy
of Fletcher's upcoming novel. 
</p><div>
</div><p>Contributors of $100 or more receive acknowledgment in back of the
book and an exclusive short story written custom for the contributor.</p><div>
</div><p>Contributors of $1000 or more will be listed as a sponsor on the
re-release of a novel Fletcher previously authored.</p><div>
</div><p>Contributors of $5,000 or more will get a signed card from
Fletcher who will probably be in the hospital recovering from shock
at a donation that huge.(Seriously, you'll get a print copy of both
Fletcher's novels when released, mention in the back of the book,
listed as a sponsor on the re-release, and a special place on all of
Fletcher's websites plus free advertising for life on any of her
sites.)</p><div>

</div><h3>The Impact</h3><div>
</div><p>The impact contributors have with this fundraiser is significant
on the author and her family. Not only will you, the contributor,
help us, you'll help Julie prove that authors and author rights are
NOT something to joke about or take advantage of. 
</p><div>
</div><p>Artists are treated unfairly by those that would make money off
those author's works, but let those authors end up in poverty. This
isn't right – for Fletcher or any other author going through such a
thing. She hopes that this will set a standard for all authors that
have been tricked into giving up their rights.</p><div>
</div><p>You'll also be helping keep a family afloat – three of the four
school aged children still need school supplies and clothing.
Clothing donations from a personal friend has helped supply clothing
in full for one of the children, in part for the others. They still
need shoes and supplies.</p><div>
</div><p>You'll help buy the parts to repair their washing machine –
being poor is fine, being stinky is not.</p><div>
</div><p>You'll help them buy a used car so the family can make it to
medical/dental appointments. This is extremely important as Fletcher
missed enough dental appointments due to scheduled cabs not showing
up (from Medicaid paid transport) and cannot receive treatment from
her dentist as the office no longer will see her as a patient- her
disorder is causing her teeth to break apart.</p><div>
</div><p>The author will (hopefully) be able to secure a lawyer that can
help her in a publishing legal problem and recover damages along with
moving forward with the publishing of a novel. The proceeds will
allow the author to support herself and family with a passive income
stream when Julie isn't able to write due to chronic joint pain. It
will also cover cover art and release costs.</p><div>
</div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div>
</div><p>I may not win my legal case. This is always a risk.</p><div>
</div><p> I could become severely disabled or die suddenly which would
leave me unable to fulfill my part of the fundraiser obligations.
I've been hospitalized once for stroke-like symptoms in Rochester
(Strong Memorial) in 2012 and then sent to the emergency room for
another stronger, more severe neurological emergency event this year
(2014). 
</p><div>
</div><p>It may take some time to find a lawyer that will fight my legal
case. It may take a long time to recover damages and publishing
rights for the current situation.</p><div>
</div><p><br/></p><div>
</div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div>
</div><p>If you can't contribute you can help by sharing this fundraiser.
Someone else may be able to help.</p><div>
</div><p> If you are a lawyer or know a lawyer who would be interested in
helping Julie – please let her know. 
</p><div>
</div><p>If you're interested in helping with school supplies or clothing,
but don't want to donate here because you're worried, gift codes for
online shops is a way you can donate and receive verification of what
is purchased with the code or online gift card. (These work best as
the family doesn't have a car and can have clothing or supplies
delivered).

</div>
</div><div> <p>As I've mentioned before, 90% of the funds raised will go towards paying author honorariums.  We're an organization made up entirely of volunteers, and our passion is to create a launchpad for emerging authors and artists.  </p>
<p>We don't look at resumes and we don't read author bios until after we've studied the work.  We accept work from students, emerging professionals, established authors, and those just returning to a love for writing.  We respect talent and passion above accolades and awards.  </p>
<p>Our team is willing to dedicate our time to the work-- combing through submissions, organizing layouts, scrambling for author photos, mocking-up cover art-- but the talent belongs to our authors and artists.  And they're the ones who will reap the benefits once we reach our goal of $2,000.  We'll be able to publish at least six future editions and fully pay all of our authors and artists for each one.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our primary challenge at the moment is prevalent throughout the publishing industry: how can we reconcile print and digital media?  There were a lot of factors at play in our decision to actively pursue publishing on both fronts.  Digital publishing is less expensive, obviously, but it's also harder to reap the benefits in order to continue publishing into the future.   We'd also like to be able to provide our authors and artists with a copy of the publication in which they're featured, which we can't do online.  </p>
<p>We want to honor personal tastes, which is why we're publishing on multiple avenues.  Our risk is that we will be spread too thin, but I am utterly confident that we can overcome.  This publication is our passion, and we have brought it this far; we can see it past the next obstacle.  </p>

</div></div>","The Axe Factory is a quarterly online literary journal that publishes contemporary poetry, prose, and visual art in any 2D medium.  We curate each edition of like a gallery exhibition--drawing together pieces in various styles and media that complement and offset each other.  We encourage collaboration, blending of media, and experimentation.


What We Need....
Here at the Axe Factory Press:
1. We believe that authors and artists should be paid for their work.  Publicity is not currency, which is why we have been dedicated to paying an honorarium to our authors from the start.
2. We believe that our readers should have the ability to access our publication in the format that they prefer, which is why, despite being primarily web-based, we are publishing a print edition as well.
We are looking to raise $2,000 in three weeks.
90% of the funds raised by this campaign will be used to sponsor authors and artists in future editions of The Axe Factory.  If we reach our goal of $2,000, we will be able to fully fund six editions of The Axe Factory.
10% of the funds raised will go towards publication of the first print edition of The Axe Factory Press.  


...& What You GetWe're offering an array of Axe Factory Press merch, plus a special pre-order of the first print edition of The Axe Factory.  
For a $5 pledge, we'll send you an art-print Axe Factory Press postcard with a personal thank-you, plus we'll thank you on our website.
If you pledge $15, you're pre-ordering the first print edition of The Axe Factory!  We'll keep you updated on the process and once publication is complete we'll send the edition your way!  
We're also printing Axe Factory Press t-shirts featuring our crowned bear logo; for a pledge of $25, we'll send you one!  $25 sponsors an author or artist for publication, so we'll list you as a sponsor and thank you on our website.
If you pledge $50, you're subscribing to The Axe Factory for one calendar year (four print editions-- and a savings of $10 versus buying them individually).  
For a pledge of $100, you'll get a year's subscription (four print editions) and the aforementioned Axe Factory Press t-shirt, plus an embroidered Axe Factory Press bookbag.
For $250, we'll list you as a PATRON on four print and web editions of The Axe Factory.  You'll receive a copy of each issue, plus the bookbag and t-shirt.
And for $500, you become a BLACK BEAR BENEFACTOR!  We'll dedicate one edition of the The Axe Factory to you!  We'll send you three copies of that special edition, plus you'll be subscribed for the remainder of the year (six print editions total).  Your three special editions will arrive inside your Axe Factory Press bookbag along with a crowned bear t-shirt.  


The Impact

 As I've mentioned before, 90% of the funds raised will go towards paying author honorariums.  We're an organization made up entirely of volunteers, and our passion is to create a launchpad for emerging authors and artists.  
We don't look at resumes and we don't read author bios until after we've studied the work.  We accept work from students, emerging professionals, established authors, and those just returning to a love for writing.  We respect talent and passion above accolades and awards.  
Our team is willing to dedicate our time to the work-- combing through submissions, organizing layouts, scrambling for author photos, mocking-up cover art-- but the talent belongs to our authors and artists.  And they're the ones who will reap the benefits once we reach our goal of $2,000.  We'll be able to publish at least six future editions and fully pay all of our authors and artists for each one.


  Risks & Challenges Our primary challenge at the moment is prevalent throughout the publishing industry: how can we reconcile print and digital media?  There were a lot of factors at play in our decision to actively pursue publishing on both fronts.  Digital publishing is less expensive, obviously, but it's also harder to reap the benefits in order to continue publishing into the future.   We'd also like to be able to provide our authors and artists with a copy of the publication in which they're featured, which we can't do online.  
We want to honor personal tastes, which is why we're publishing on multiple avenues.  Our risk is that we will be spread too thin, but I am utterly confident that we can overcome.  This publication is our passion, and we have brought it this far; we can see it past the next obstacle.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Stephanie Schroeder and my project is to travel the US in search of the happiest communities.  What are the happiest communities here in America?  What common threads do they share?  And, as social media becomes a part of our daily lives, is it bringing us closer relationships or is it weakening our physical communities?  In order to get my answers, I will be traveling by car in a time of 7 weeks to 29 randomly selected locations across the continental US.  I'll interview people in grocery stores, on the street, in front of their houses, from the young to old and from all walks of life and backgrounds. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The great thing about my project is that it affects everyone.  Pretty much everyone's lives are impacted by social media and networking.  As humans, we all want to belong in a community as it's one of our basic needs!  We can all apply what makes some communities happier than others in our own lives.  By the end of my trip, I will have very detailed information to publish
 research on American happiness today.   This research will be the basis 
for my book in which I will share the data I collected, conclusions I drew, and adventures I had along the way! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will be needing around $3,000.  Even though I have a pretty fuel-efficient car, the majority of this need will be gas money.  Other money will be used for printing surveys, buying cans of tuna to eat along the way, and hopefully enough to stay in campsites instead of my car.  Money will also go back to give people perks for donating!  Those who help support me will be rewarded in return with some pretty neat incentives, such as t shirts, kitsch souvenirs, and more.<br/></p>

<p>""Brass Knuckles LA"", is a poetry slam team, with members: Judy Holiday, Mr. Poetic (Darnell Davenport), Madison DiNapoli, Ashley Catharine, and E. Amato. The team was formed out of it's home venue, Kaos Network, in Leimert Park. For several months, the venue holds slams open to the general public for performance poets to compete. Slammers go through vigorous competitions in hopes of making the final five. But it's after all slots have been fought for and earned, that the REAL work begins. The five artists come together and write collaboratively, practice, fund-raise, receive coaching, and perform together for 3 months all in preparation of competing against 80+ teams on a national level. This is Brass Knuckles' second year having a team, and we are excited to share our work outside of our city on a larger platform, and receive workshops from some of the most respected artists in our community...and YOU can make that possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Team has sacrificed a lot of time and work hours all for the sake of our dedication to our team. When we are on stage and surrounded by our peers in the poetry community...we are most alive. Our practicing and collaborations will NOT be a waste if we are not able to go, because we are fortunate to have achieved all that we have in such little time. However the ability to witness and perform in front of other artists on a national level will be missed without your help. </p>

<i>My name is Josie Moon. I wrote a story called THE BUBBLE TREE.
Although a children’s picture book, I suggest this story for people of all
ages. I aim to evoke the dreamer within. 
</i><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What is THE BUBBLE TREE?</b></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The Bubble Tree is about a young girl who craves adventure. After discovering a tree that grows bubbles, she longs to follow the bubbles that float out into the world. She goes on an inward journey,  learning lessons in life, which evolves her soul and enriches her heart. </span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>This
 project is a result of a game I once played with a friend of mine seven
 years ago. The name of the game is “what would you rather be?” The 
players ask each other what they would prefer to be. I had suggested a 
tree, or a bubble. My friend Evan was torn over which to choose, for 
they are both so appealing, though total opposites. Then I imagined 
living a life as both a tree and a bubble. I imagined embodying a life 
of balance in having the qualities of something so strong and grounded,
 and something so light and free. Although I wrote THE BUBBLE TREE seven
 years ago, only now is it ready to be exposed. The story evolved along 
with all my travels and changed with each new path of my journey. 
Finally, after many explorations and self evolution, I am ready to share
 it with the world. </span></p>

<br/>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Who am I?</b><br/></p>
<p>I come
from Big Hollow road in Maplecrest, New York. I grew up in a family
of seven in a house that my father built. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045287/files/20141125023630-b054a44b-6c91-4dc7-96bc-8cefed77d805.1.jpg?1416911790"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><i> I think of myself as a writer, a
traveler, a dreamer, a dancer and a peaceful warrior. </i></span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><i>Since I can remember,  I´ve felt the value of togetherness and human companionship,  though over the years I have learned the importance of the self. As much as I love and miss my family, I´ve decided to live on the other side of the ocean to learn about the world and about myself.</i></span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>I spent my childhood
discovering the imagination. Whether it was looking for fairies in the forest,
directing plays with my sisters, or writing tales, I made sure my world was
filled with magic and adventure. Now as a twenty-eight year old woman, I
have lived in numerous cities and countries fulfilling my desire to explore the
world. This story THE BUBBLE TREE is a depiction of my lust for exploration and the unknown. 
The protagonist in the story finds a tree growing bubbles and follows the
bubbles into the world to seek her own adventure and realize true growth from
within.</span></p>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Why is this project so important? </b><br/></p>
<p>I am
twenty eight years old and I still go directly to the children's book section.
For me, they are a magical world to discover. As a child, illustrated tales
were so important to me. It made me believe in worlds other than the one around
me. My sister Iris and I used to sit on the couch together and ¨jump¨into the
illustrations. We did this by putting our faces so close to the page we couldn’t
see anything except the pictures and our blurry noses. Picture books are a
beautiful escape, and all children deserve their own journey.  <br/></p>
<p>THE BUBBLE TREE is my first attempt for publication. The success of this campaign is so
important to me for many reasons, one being that it's a personal story of mine
brought to life.  Time to fly!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1045769/files/20141125071738-pag6_vertical_doble.jpg?1416928658"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why do I need funding?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>THE BUBBLE TREE is a picture
book, and the nature of all picture books is that the pictures carry the story.
I, as the author, have always had very specific images of each and every page.
I wanted the images full of color, in a soft, dream-like place that made the
reader feel warm and enchanted.  When my illustrator Laura Castello made her first sketches for me, I
knew right away she was the one! Her work is beautiful, with diverse
techniques, small detail, and amazing color work. Her job is massive: she must
sketch and paint 24 pages of this wild tale, plus the cover art and all design
elements. I, alone do not have the funding to pay her. She has completed the first five pages, and will finish the book if we reach our goal! We must also pay Indiegogo a percentage of our amount raised. Once the book is ready,
we then
send it into be published and will be faced with additional printing fees for maximum quality coloring, and in hard cover edition. <i> We will print the first copies for our offered ""gift perks"" for participating, but the book will always be available on line with a 'print-on-demand' format. </i></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why choose crowd funding? </b></p>
<p>Crowd funding is a new
concept for me, and at first I felt skeptical. After realizing the nature of
how it works, I was delighted. Publishing this book the traditional way would
be great, but doing it because there is a network of support and energy behind
the project is a true victory! If this book can speak to enough people to
accomplish the publication,  then it will become not only my dream, but a
collective dream. A small bubble carried by loving winds. </p>

<p>We are working on designing posters and stickers of THE

carrots and onions in :) </p>

<br/>
<p><b>I will also be giving my personally crafted mini SWINGS as gifts.</b> </p>
<p>I love to swing. Its one of my greatest therapies. Since I have lived in Barcelona, I started collecting recycled fruit crates from the street, breaking them, sanding them, and painting them uniquely. Now there are many hanging in the trees of different Barcelona neighborhoods. They are my street art, and each one is totally unique. They are perfect for your favorite tree, to hang in your house, or, they're even  small enough to  wear as a necklace!</p>

<br/><p><b>The Impact of THE BUBBLE TREE</b></p>
<p>This story has gotten amazing reviews reviews and reactions from
the people I've shared it with. Most of them are enchanted, and some very
surprised, though one older couple in Barcelona had a different response. They
thought the message behind the story was too ""deep"" for children.  Although
it’s a children's book, there IS a deeper message that I hope will speak to
people of all ages. I can recall the books of my childhood that I read now, and
realize the various, more profound messages behind these tales. Kids have a way
of filtering what they can make sense of. What they may not understand lies in
their subconscious and may appear later on in life. Why not instill positivity
and support through storytelling while the young brain is developing?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why believe in this story?</b></p>
<p>I believe in this story because it promotes a positive message.
In a world where we must find our way through many struggles, fight for what we
want, and realize our dreams, I think it’s important for people to believe in
themselves, and their potential at a very early age. The Bubble Tree’s message
encourages self exploration and expansion. It reminds people that magic exists
if we want to experience it. I invite everyone to participate in
this project, young or old, because we all have dreams to realize.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b>?</p>
<p>My challenges thus far have been mainly myself. It has taken me so long to get to this point, mainly for not taking enough initiative! <i>Talking</i> about doing something is quite different than actually <i>doing</i> it. I think many people suffer from the crippling state of laziness, fear, and self doubt. What a toxic place! I decided it was time to stop talking and get things rolling. I wanted to prove to myself (and all the others I shared this project with) that I could make it a reality. </p>
<p>The second obstacle is not having the financial means to do it alone. Many people misunderstand my situation and think that I come from heaps of money because I've been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit and live in Europe. This is far from the truth. I come from a modest family, rich in love and health, who taught me how to get where I need to go by working hard.</p>
<p><i> I have faith in this project:  first off, because it comes from a very pure place, and has nothing but good intentions. Secondly, I have faith in my supporters and know I have an amazing group of people who will be the angels that help carry it through. </i><br/></p>

<p>To my fellow starving artists who can't contribute
financially, I salute you! I am one of the pack. Your love and support and
ability to SHARE is immeasurable and I am forever grateful for your super
powers in propelling this book into reality!! In a world full of technology, I
still believe strongly in word of mouth! This is the true essence of story
telling!  I have whispered this story to people from the mountains of
North Carolina, shouted it through the noise of NYC, spout it to the bass of
booming clubs in Berlin , told it along the wandering Quai's of Paris, and
danced the story alive to drums in Barcelona. After having reached all these
people verbally, THE BUBBLE TREE is begging to be put to ink and paper.  If
this story speaks to you, PLEASE share it with fellow dreamers, and<i> more importantly,
those who need a reminder of the dreamer they are. </i></p>

</div></div>","Hello beautiful people!


My name is Josie Moon. I wrote a story called THE BUBBLE TREE.
Although a children’s picture book, I suggest this story for people of all
ages. I aim to evoke the dreamer within. 

What is THE BUBBLE TREE?
The Bubble Tree is about a young girl who craves adventure. After discovering a tree that grows bubbles, she longs to follow the bubbles that float out into the world. She goes on an inward journey,  learning lessons in life, which evolves her soul and enriches her heart. 
This
 project is a result of a game I once played with a friend of mine seven
 years ago. The name of the game is “what would you rather be?” The 
players ask each other what they would prefer to be. I had suggested a 
tree, or a bubble. My friend Evan was torn over which to choose, for 
they are both so appealing, though total opposites. Then I imagined 
living a life as both a tree and a bubble. I imagined embodying a life 
of balance in having the qualities of something so strong and grounded,
 and something so light and free. Although I wrote THE BUBBLE TREE seven
 years ago, only now is it ready to be exposed. The story evolved along 
with all my travels and changed with each new path of my journey. 
Finally, after many explorations and self evolution, I am ready to share
 it with the world. 




Who am I?
I come
from Big Hollow road in Maplecrest, New York. I grew up in a family
of seven in a house that my father built. 

 I think of myself as a writer, a
traveler, a dreamer, a dancer and a peaceful warrior. 
Since I can remember,  I´ve felt the value of togetherness and human companionship,  though over the years I have learned the importance of the self. As much as I love and miss my family, I´ve decided to live on the other side of the ocean to learn about the world and about myself.
I spent my childhood
discovering the imagination. Whether it was looking for fairies in the forest,
directing plays with my sisters, or writing tales, I made sure my world was
filled with magic and adventure. Now as a twenty-eight year old woman, I
have lived in numerous cities and countries fulfilling my desire to explore the
world. This story THE BUBBLE TREE is a depiction of my lust for exploration and the unknown. 
The protagonist in the story finds a tree growing bubbles and follows the
bubbles into the world to seek her own adventure and realize true growth from
within.
Why is this project so important? 
I am
twenty eight years old and I still go directly to the children's book section.
For me, they are a magical world to discover. As a child, illustrated tales
were so important to me. It made me believe in worlds other than the one around
me. My sister Iris and I used to sit on the couch together and ¨jump¨into the
illustrations. We did this by putting our faces so close to the page we couldn’t
see anything except the pictures and our blurry noses. Picture books are a
beautiful escape, and all children deserve their own journey.  
THE BUBBLE TREE is my first attempt for publication. The success of this campaign is so
important to me for many reasons, one being that it's a personal story of mine
brought to life.  Time to fly!




Why do I need funding?

THE BUBBLE TREE is a picture
book, and the nature of all picture books is that the pictures carry the story.
I, as the author, have always had very specific images of each and every page.
I wanted the images full of color, in a soft, dream-like place that made the
reader feel warm and enchanted.  When my illustrator Laura Castello made her first sketches for me, I
knew right away she was the one! Her work is beautiful, with diverse
techniques, small detail, and amazing color work. Her job is massive: she must
sketch and paint 24 pages of this wild tale, plus the cover art and all design
elements. I, alone do not have the funding to pay her. She has completed the first five pages, and will finish the book if we reach our goal! We must also pay Indiegogo a percentage of our amount raised. Once the book is ready,
we then
send it into be published and will be faced with additional printing fees for maximum quality coloring, and in hard cover edition.  We will print the first copies for our offered ""gift perks"" for participating, but the book will always be available on line with a 'print-on-demand' format. 

Why choose crowd funding? 
Crowd funding is a new
concept for me, and at first I felt skeptical. After realizing the nature of
how it works, I was delighted. Publishing this book the traditional way would
be great, but doing it because there is a network of support and energy behind
the project is a true victory! If this book can speak to enough people to
accomplish the publication,  then it will become not only my dream, but a
collective dream. A small bubble carried by loving winds. 



There are some gifts to offer for your support!
We are working on designing posters and stickers of THE
BUBBLE TREE cover art.  We are also making canvas tote bags with THE BUBBLE TREE cover art , in which  you can carry your apples,
carrots and onions in :) 



I will also be giving my personally crafted mini SWINGS as gifts. 
I love to swing. Its one of my greatest therapies. Since I have lived in Barcelona, I started collecting recycled fruit crates from the street, breaking them, sanding them, and painting them uniquely. Now there are many hanging in the trees of different Barcelona neighborhoods. They are my street art, and each one is totally unique. They are perfect for your favorite tree, to hang in your house, or, they're even  small enough to  wear as a necklace!







The Impact of THE BUBBLE TREE
This story has gotten amazing reviews reviews and reactions from
the people I've shared it with. Most of them are enchanted, and some very
surprised, though one older couple in Barcelona had a different response. They
thought the message behind the story was too ""deep"" for children.  Although
it’s a children's book, there IS a deeper message that I hope will speak to
people of all ages. I can recall the books of my childhood that I read now, and
realize the various, more profound messages behind these tales. Kids have a way
of filtering what they can make sense of. What they may not understand lies in
their subconscious and may appear later on in life. Why not instill positivity
and support through storytelling while the young brain is developing?

Why believe in this story?
I believe in this story because it promotes a positive message.
In a world where we must find our way through many struggles, fight for what we
want, and realize our dreams, I think it’s important for people to believe in
themselves, and their potential at a very early age. The Bubble Tree’s message
encourages self exploration and expansion. It reminds people that magic exists
if we want to experience it. I invite everyone to participate in
this project, young or old, because we all have dreams to realize.



Risks & Challenges?
My challenges thus far have been mainly myself. It has taken me so long to get to this point, mainly for not taking enough initiative! Talking about doing something is quite different than actually doing it. I think many people suffer from the crippling state of laziness, fear, and self doubt. What a toxic place! I decided it was time to stop talking and get things rolling. I wanted to prove to myself (and all the others I shared this project with) that I could make it a reality. 
The second obstacle is not having the financial means to do it alone. Many people misunderstand my situation and think that I come from heaps of money because I've been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit and live in Europe. This is far from the truth. I come from a modest family, rich in love and health, who taught me how to get where I need to go by working hard.
 I have faith in this project:  first off, because it comes from a very pure place, and has nothing but good intentions. Secondly, I have faith in my supporters and know I have an amazing group of people who will be the angels that help carry it through. 




ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO SUPPORT!
To my fellow starving artists who can't contribute
financially, I salute you! I am one of the pack. Your love and support and
ability to SHARE is immeasurable and I am forever grateful for your super
powers in propelling this book into reality!! In a world full of technology, I
still believe strongly in word of mouth! This is the true essence of story
telling!  I have whispered this story to people from the mountains of
North Carolina, shouted it through the noise of NYC, spout it to the bass of
booming clubs in Berlin , told it along the wandering Quai's of Paris, and
danced the story alive to drums in Barcelona. After having reached all these
people verbally, THE BUBBLE TREE is begging to be put to ink and paper.  If
this story speaks to you, PLEASE share it with fellow dreamers, and more importantly,
those who need a reminder of the dreamer they are.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p>The Autonomy Mind provides practical advice on taking back our lost freedom of self-determination through adopting an autonomy mindset, and offers an antidote to the fear of missing out, blurred personal boundaries, and other symptoms from the loss of personal autonomy.<br/><br/>My name is Jason Yang, and I am the author of The Autonomy Mind. I wrote this book because I’ve found so many talented and diligent people in my life never live up to their full potentials. They gradually give up their personal autonomy as a result of long being in a subordinate position, or they simply chose to succumb to groupthink. In a world full of ever-changing fads, sink-or-swim work culture, and information inequality in hierarchies, it is now more than ever the moment for us to adopt an autonomy mindset to look after our own interests and achieve self-realization in our careers.<br/><br/><strong>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to develop your autonomy mindset in your life. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for initiating this change in mindset. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool and a road map to help you develop a new mindset that empowers you to focus on and dedicate to your most cherished goals in your professional and personal life.</strong><br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how we gradually lost our personal autonomy, how the loss is accelerating in the modern world and several principles that help you rebuild your personal autonomy and unleash your full potential.<br/><br/><strong>You'll read about the latest research in cognitive sciences</strong> that dissects the scientific dynamics of personal autonomy, <strong>and real-life experiences</strong> from the author, his friends and interviewees, ranging from graduate school students to corporate employees in different capacities.<br/><br/><strong>The Autonomy Mind is a nonfiction book that speaks to students, corporate employees, and entrepreneurs alike. </strong>You will love this book if you want to navigate your professional and personal life in a way more truthful to your most cherished goals, or if you want to unleash your underutilized potentials and create your own future.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>Jason Yang works in Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language Processing. He approaches his multiple ventures with the top-down perspective of an entrepreneur and the bottom-up perspective of an engineer. He earned an MS in Cognitive Sciences from Brown University, an MS in Computer Science from Johns Hopkins University, a BS in Software Engineering and a BA in Japanese from Dalian University of Technology.<br/><br/>He wrote this book because he’s seen so many talented and diligent people never live up to their full potential because they gradually give up their personal autonomy. He feels the urge to bring more awareness to our personal autonomy and the urge for us to take action to develop the autonomy mindset. In the book, he offers effective actionable items towards adopting the mindset and points out that personal autonomy is in our human nature, rather than a luxury afforded to a select few.</p>
<p>Aside from writing and building out his ideas in AI, Jason boasts of his huge personal library of books in English, Chinese, Japanese and French in downtown Manhattan. He is a relentless life-long learner with infinite curiosity to better understand our world. When outside of his home office, he can be found enjoying hiking, biking, museum-going or archery.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Jason at xi_x_yang@alumni.brown.edu.</p>

<h3><strong>The Book - The Autonomy Mind</strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>- How We Got Here: contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. We explore our loss of personal autonomy in the modern world, how the recent trends in technology and the workplace are accelerating it, and the various psychosomatic symptoms that result from it, backed by the latest research in cognitive sciences, management sciences and more. Particularly, we will see how the debate between David Graeber and Peter Thiel on technology trends related to personal autonomy, and moreover, we show how the recent Covid-19 disaster uncovered our latent tendency of groupthink. Then, we move on to look at how being in the subordinate position in any relationship, either at school or at work, usually contributes to the loss of autonomy. We wrap up this part with examples showing the urgency that we develop an autonomy mindset to tackle the challenges in our personal and professional life and how to thrive based on the autonomy mindset.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>- Principles of the Autonomy Mind: contains Chapters 4-8. We will dig into specific theories and examples of what the various principles of the autonomy mindset are and what this mindset looks like in real life. We will find out how phenomena such as the fear of success, the fear of being rejected, the fear of missing out, the fear of saying no, and the fear of dedication all share one common root cause — the lack of personal autonomy. We look at how people work on getting back their autonomy and see their life strategy work out successfully in different settings, through adopting each of the five principles, citing examples from my interviewees, friends and myself.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains the Epilogue. In this final section, we will revisit some of the important points raised in Part 1 and 2, on the urgency of developing an autonomy mindset in the modern world, and how a successful combination of all the five principles of the autonomy mindset can initiate the change in us to pursue our own interests and goals more freely. Furthermore, we will see some interesting latest developments in our society’s increasing awareness of our loss of autonomy, such as the RISE 4 MIT movement, which fights for more graduate student autonomy and has made great progress so far.</p>

In the book, he offers effective actionable items towards adopting the mindset and points out that personal autonomy is in our human nature, rather than a luxury afforded to a select few.
Aside from writing and building out his ideas in AI, Jason boasts of his huge personal library of books in English, Chinese, Japanese and French in downtown Manhattan. He is a relentless life-long learner with infinite curiosity to better understand our world. When outside of his home office, he can be found enjoying hiking, biking, museum-going or archery.For more information, you can connect with Jason at xi_x_yang@alumni.brown.edu.
 

The Book - The Autonomy Mind
The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 - How We Got Here: contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. We explore our loss of personal autonomy in the modern world, how the recent trends in technology and the workplace are accelerating it, and the various psychosomatic symptoms that result from it, backed by the latest research in cognitive sciences, management sciences and more. Particularly, we will see how the debate between David Graeber and Peter Thiel on technology trends related to personal autonomy, and moreover, we show how the recent Covid-19 disaster uncovered our latent tendency of groupthink. Then, we move on to look at how being in the subordinate position in any relationship, either at school or at work, usually contributes to the loss of autonomy. We wrap up this part with examples showing the urgency that we develop an autonomy mindset to tackle the challenges in our personal and professional life and how to thrive based on the autonomy mindset.Part 2 - Principles of the Autonomy Mind: contains Chapters 4-8. We will dig into specific theories and examples of what the various principles of the autonomy mindset are and what this mindset looks like in real life. We will find out how phenomena such as the fear of success, the fear of being rejected, the fear of missing out, the fear of saying no, and the fear of dedication all share one common root cause — the lack of personal autonomy. We look at how people work on getting back their autonomy and see their life strategy work out successfully in different settings, through adopting each of the five principles, citing examples from my interviewees, friends and myself.Part 3 contains the Epilogue. In this final section, we will revisit some of the important points raised in Part 1 and 2, on the urgency of developing an autonomy mindset in the modern world, and how a successful combination of all the five principles of the autonomy mindset can initiate the change in us to pursue our own interests and goals more freely. Furthermore, we will see some interesting latest developments in our society’s increasing awareness of our loss of autonomy, such as the RISE 4 MIT movement, which fights for more graduate student autonomy and has made great progress so far.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.
