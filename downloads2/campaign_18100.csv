About The Suburban Motel Series
George F. Walker's The Suburban Motel Series tells six different stories in the same suburban motel room on the north end of Edmonton.
Check out an interview with George F Walker speaking on writing and other productions of The Suburban Motel Series.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_3Onb_6fTo


About The Project

The Suburban Motel Series is our biggest project to date and we have hired over 40 Edmonton artists to make it happen.  
3 directors.                                                                                             
3 assistant directors.
15 actors.  
6 designers. 
3 stage managers.  
3 assistant stage managers.  

6 crew members.  
1 producer/publicist.  
1 technical director. 
1 production manager. 
24 of those artists are emerging professionals.

The Ask
We are excited that we have the opportunity to work on a project of this size and scope.  However, it does not come without cost. 
We are hoping you can help us raise the final $6000 that we need to successfully mount the series.  What does that money go towards, you ask? 
$2500 of it goes towards ensuring the actors won't be naked (costume materials).  We need over 30 costumes for the actors.  By donating $84 you could provide and actor with a costume! 


$1000  of if goes towards prop materials. By donating you could help us buy any number of things found in a motel room, like a tv, bed, towels, lamps, alarm clock, chairs, a vacuum, tiny vodka bottles- all sorts of fun things!


$2500 of it goes towards construction materials to build the set.  By donating you could help us build walls for the set, buy carpet, source windows and doors so our motel room looks just like it does in real life!

 
These budgetary requirements are absolutely essential for a professional production.

Stunned and not sure what to do, I put the tapes into the freezer to kill the ants, but then I just had cold tapes filled with dead ants. Heart broken, I finally threw them all away. Luckily, Peter Neville who documented most of the Milly shows from it’s beginning at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lounge_Ax"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lounge Ax</a>, made copies of most of the masters before he gave them to me. Some shows are lost forever, but many are still on tape. However, that tape is deteriorating quickly, some of them are well over 25 years old dating back to early 1988. It is, again, my great luck that Peter has become a web-God, and determined to save what we have left (and reduce his clutter), he proposed doing this Indiegogo campaign to archive what remains. I resisted the idea of asking for help, but he was patient, very patient. And then I realized that what has always made the Milly shows great is you, the audience. Performers say it to me over and over again, “You have the best audiences.” So it is fitting that we should do this together as we have always done, because without you, there is no show.

events from an early age. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our
childhood involved entertainment of different sorts.  With our regular home shows, we would find
any reason to dance and entertain.  Music
always filled the house, when our mother played her vinyl records of Jamaican
reggae, Scar, Lovers’ Rock, Dub etc, our burning passion for music
bubbled.  We’ve enjoyed stage shows like
SLU Jazz Festival through the early 90’s and met some of the international
artistes, Zion Train with local artists, regional shows featuring performers
like Sizzla, Anthony B,  Maxi Priest,
John Holt and so on.  We would be amazed
at the entire production of a show both with talent and hands on for set up,
how it all just falls into place.</p>

members of the Charmolion Dance Ensemble and got our first chances at 15 to
work and perform at hotels, national shows and regional arts festivals.  Bashana played the flute in the Secondary

competitions and now choreograph pieces with students from a few schools.  Shadrea’s choreography with Corinth Secondary
School, won the national cheerleading competition in 2004.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Shadrea
danced professionally with choreographer Yalitza Garcia at Club St. Lucia by
Splash which played a major role in developing her stage presence and dance
technique.  Bashana has been a model in
television and print advertising and has walked for renowned designers in a
number of fashion shows.  Most recently
being HOT Couture in our Jazz &amp; Arts Festival 2014.  She also plays a leading role in our local

<p>Toward the end of the play, the motel room becomes completely covered with tin foil. I don't want to spoil the story, but this is absolutely essential to the plot. Industrial strength tin foil runs about $25 per roll and we expect to need as many of these as we can get. </p>

    WHY BUG IS IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW



In a horror story, the horror elements are only there to service the character development and to better enlighten the audience on what the storyteller is trying to say. A ghost story is never about the ghost. It is about the people being haunted. 
The characters in Bug are haunted by their own minds, and the horror elements in Tracy Lett's play are there to service the discussion of how intense grief can contribute to the development of mental illness. Discussing mental illness and what leads to it is an important discussion in our society today. 




Risks & Challenges Our greatest challenge in putting up this play is to ensure that the difficult subject matter is handled with respect and integrity.

<h3><b>About the director...</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Chelsey Ng and I hail from the sunny island of Singapore. I moved to the glorious, glittering, all consuming island of Manhattan in the Fall of 2013 and have made a home for myself here.</p>
<p>What I've discovered on this whirlwind of a creative journey is that I'm happiest when I am creating in any way shape or form. I fully intend on constantly exploring new mediums and I have no intention of stopping that process anytime soon. <br/></p>
<p>The decision to take on 'Danny' was, like most good things in life, spontaneous. I was having drinks with my best friends <i>(Sam &amp; Monty - AKA the cast)</i> , we had just wrapped ""D I S T O R T I O N"" <i>(an experimental variety show we worked on in the Spring of last year) </i>and were kind of in a daze. We knew we had captured magic in the little scene we had explored from 'Danny' and we didn't know how to let it go.</p>
<p>So we didn't.</p>
<p>We took it upon ourselves to dive headfirst into the murky glorious depths of Shanley's masterpiece because we knew no one else would do it for us. </p>
<p>It's honestly been terrifying but it's also been enormously liberating to see this production take shape. To know that creating your own work truly isn't impossible, all it takes is vision, drive and belief. </p>
<p>Oh... and of course, I would be lost amidst the mire if it weren't for the support of beautiful people like you.</p>

</div></div>","A little bit about us...

Ebb&Flow Productions is a burgeoning bespoke theatre company founded by Chelsey Ng based in New York City. We aim to curate theatrical experiences that foster visceral connections between the audience and the actor. 


'Danny and the Deep Blue Sea' has been a labor of love for the past year. It's been a journey of experimentation and it continues to be a constantly evolving beast. There has never been a dull moment in our rehearsal space which is exciting because the production continues to breathe and live with each step we take moving forward. 

About the director...

My name is Chelsey Ng and I hail from the sunny island of Singapore. I moved to the glorious, glittering, all consuming island of Manhattan in the Fall of 2013 and have made a home for myself here.
What I've discovered on this whirlwind of a creative journey is that I'm happiest when I am creating in any way shape or form. I fully intend on constantly exploring new mediums and I have no intention of stopping that process anytime soon. 
The decision to take on 'Danny' was, like most good things in life, spontaneous. I was having drinks with my best friends (Sam & Monty - AKA the cast) , we had just wrapped ""D I S T O R T I O N"" (an experimental variety show we worked on in the Spring of last year) and were kind of in a daze. We knew we had captured magic in the little scene we had explored from 'Danny' and we didn't know how to let it go.
So we didn't.
We took it upon ourselves to dive headfirst into the murky glorious depths of Shanley's masterpiece because we knew no one else would do it for us. 
It's honestly been terrifying but it's also been enormously liberating to see this production take shape. To know that creating your own work truly isn't impossible, all it takes is vision, drive and belief. 
Oh... and of course, I would be lost amidst the mire if it weren't for the support of beautiful people like you.


What We Need

We've set a goal of $2500 to bolster our production value.



$1500: Scenic Design.Without spoiling all the fun, the scenic design of 'Danny' is incredibly ambitious and essential to the world of the play. Audience members will be transported into a heightened world, unlike any they would associate with previous interpretations of this work. This unique multi-sensory performance will take place in a former knitting factory/butchery/underground artist gallery that has been reimagined as a multi-purpose raw space called the Artery @464 Seneca Avenue in Brooklyn, New York.There will be many tactile elements such as sand and driftwood. Large billowy sheets of muslin. Crushed rose petals. Paper lanterns. Anchors and so on.We understand that this is incredibly ambiguous - but half the fun is in the mystery, isn't it?We promise to engage all five sense throughout the evening in various cheeky ways. 



$1000: Theatrical Gastronomy.As mentioned, we want to engage all 5 senses and one of the most powerful senses we have is taste. 
For one of our perks (Evening on the Deck) we invite a select few to partake in an evening of epicurean delight.  A stunning four course representation of the world in which our characters live.Another one of our perks involves a selection of delectable canapé's and bespoke cocktails catered to your desires. We've always found that creating an event out of any theatrical experience allows for audience members to have a platform for catharsis and discussion. What better way to encourage conversation than with a little liquid courage?



Perks!

Impact You're Making

    There would be no progress without experimentation. With 'Danny' we've taken great liberties with the form in which we're presenting this beautifully simple expression of humanity. 
As a company we want to take storytelling to more intimate depths, we want you to walk away feeling like you've been privy to something that you maybe shouldn't have been. You will have a story to tell that is entirely yours and that you could only share with those who were with you in that room.
By supporting us you'll be helping us to more fully flesh out a world for our actors to live in and for you to be a part of.

instruction in piano, woodwinds, violin, banjo, mandolin, guitar, brass, percussion
and voice throughout the year. Current community enrollment in these programs
is slightly above 200 students! The School also offers group instruction for
children in visual arts and drama during the school year; and summer arts
camps in drama, music and visual art for grades K-12. The GSOA Youth Orchestra
offers young people a chance to learn the art of ensemble instrument playing
and increase their proficiency on their instrument. <span>The School’s children’s theatre,<span>GSOA

<p>. GSOA charges a minimum fee that varies by program
and only covers the operating cost of the programs, with a built in allowance for
need based scholarships. GSOA believes that nothing should hold a person back
from pursuing an education in the fine arts, especially their economic
situation.<span>  We are funded by a
combination of tuition payments, private donations and corporate sponsorships.
Our funding is distributed firstly to operating costs, which are kept to minimum,
equipment necessary for classes, and providing tuition assistance to those who
need it. Because of this we have an ever-growing number of very talented and
ambitious students who enjoy performing for their community. However our dedication
to community involvement and our mission of ensuring that every student that desires
an artistic education is able to participate, has left us with a budget
shortfall. We have thus far been unable to secure funding for equipment that is
essential for our students to perform for the community. We have an amazing
stage and auditorium, however we do not have any audio projection, processing,
or amplification equipment. We are seeking donations in any amount so that we
can purchase audio equipment that will allow our performers to showcase their
various talents. We need four speakers, microphones, and wires/connectors to
make the system work. Our goal is to raise $2,000 by June 26<sup>th</sup> 2015
so that we can utilize our new system in the summer performance of Into the
Woods, not to mention future performances of the 2015/2016 season. </span></p>
<p>In the spirit of transparency we will distribute any money
raised above our fundraising goal as outlined below.</p>
<p><b>Scholarship

<p><b>Future

<p>On
average it cost $1,500 to purchase the rights to <b>legally</b> perform a play or musical </p>
<p><b>Future
production cost 60% </b></p>
<p>This
rather broad category includes costumes, song books, building materials for
sets, additional script copies for cast members, liability insurance (you know
to keep the kiddos safe), building permits and inspection cost, life and fire
safety, accessibility, advertisement, and really an endless list of items that are
required to legally and safely produce a show. </p>
<p>What’s in it for you? Firstly you will receive that
wonderful, warm and fuzzy feeling associated with acts of kindness that have a
profound and lasting impact on children’s futures. Secondly, and if you want a
more substantial reflection of your kindness, anyone who makes a single
contribution of $100.00 will have their name appear on the donors page in the
programs for this seasons performances. Anyone who makes a single contribution
of $150.00 will have a full page in the program that can be used for any <b><u>approved</u></b> advertisement, in
memoriam, dedicated to, or in honor of, submission. A copy of that program,
signed by the cast will be mailed to you after the performance. Anyone who
makes a single contribution of $200 or more will have their name placed on a

<div>Daggers MacKenzie is a one-woman musical about a knife juggler who runs away from a circus in 1894. I perform as different characters, sing original songs, and throw sharp metal near my face in the service of a story about love, risk, power dynamics, and finding your home.</div>
<div>The character originally came to me in a dream at a time when I was playing guitar, singing, and writing songs in bands, something I've been doing since I was a teenager. I wanted to go deeper with what I could do and create a real performance. I'm absolutely crazy about Hedwig and the Angry Inch (I was Yitzhak for a show when I was just out of college) and I also love Kate Bush and the way she immerses herself in different characters through song. </div>
<div>I started writing the music and let that tell me what the story was about, and decided I would embody the characters. I did that soul-searching thing that artists do and discovered that Daggers was a knife juggler, but I didn't know how to juggle. So I started training with professional jugglers and developing skills -- which I still do daily. It's frustrating and fun and totally worth it.</div>
<div>I recorded the music with producer Michael Eisenstein (Letters to Cleo), who worked extensively with my band in the past and was pivotal to creating the music. I then began developing the show with director Stephanie Abrams, founder of LA circus school Kinetic Theory Circus Arts and Theatre, who really helped make a bulk of this possible by contributing her resources, expertise, and theatre. We staged the show with a full band at the theatre last year, and it was incredible.</div>
<div>The process, from dream to development to implementation, took me three years, and the time, support, patience, and dedication of friends. I'm grateful. And I want to honor everyone's time by growing the show's audience and my performance skills and taking it to the next level.</div>
<div>This is year four, and I'm taking the show on tour to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and the United Solo Festival in NYC. I've got a great team behind me, and we're ready to go.</div>

</div>
</div><div> <p>Up until this point, I've covered much of the hard cash stuff on my own -- recordings, promotion, airfare and fees. The cost of taking a show overseas is enormous, and I've covered some already, but there are a few more things we still need to cover. </p>
<p>I've covered the cost of flights and the deposit to the theatre. This is what we still need (some costs converted to U.S. dollars from British pounds):</p> <ul> <li>Hotel (reserved, not yet paid): $2,883 for two people for 18 days. That's $160 each day, which is a good rate for a big city during festival season.</li>
<li>Food / expenses for two people for 18 days in Edinburgh (includes haggis): $900. That's $25 per person, per day, or roughly £16.5. </li>
<li>Round-trip flight from LA to NYC, plus baggage (I can't board with knives): $380</li>
<li>Promotion for Edinburgh: $180 for 5,000 flyers, 100 posters, and shipping to the venue</li>
<li>Promotion for NYC: $150 for flyers and posters</li>
<li>CD booklets: $80 for 200 prints (see an example in the gallery -- we fold and glue them!)</li>
<li>Edinburgh performer's Insurance (everyone at the festival needs this, whether they're juggling knives in front of an audience or just speaking very loudly at them): $120</li>
<li>Two Edinburgh bus passes: $135</li>
<li>Shipping and handling of Indiegogo perks: $40</li>
</ul>
<div>These are the basics. Daggers is a show with incredibly low overhead, and anything my director and I can do ourselves, we do. Any extra money we make will help us grow the show; we'd love to hire a videographer and promoter, pay for more ads, create merchandise (CDs, CD booklets, posters, t-shirts), improve upon our costumes and props, hire another band and record more music.<br/>
</div>
<div>The perks come straight from the skills cultivated to create the show: I will sing you songs, share my songwriting, guitar and juggling knowledge, entice you with character work, perform for you live or over Skype, and basically lay my heart bare. This is part of the work I want to accomplish in the show anyway, so if I get a chance to rattle your emotions and leave you with something that makes you feel or think anything, I've done my job.</div>

Risks & Challenges
For one, we need a roof over our head in Edinburgh!
Beyond that, this campaign took a lot of planning, and now we have momentum going.

The show doesn't start when we enter the theatre, but when we hit the streets. My director and I will be talking and singing and miming in alleys and squares, in parks and near store fronts, all to grab some ears and eyes and get people to come. We just need flyers and a hearty Scottish breakfast.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">LADY is a new play about the lengths we go to for beauty and power. It's loosely based on Countess Bathory, who (if the rumors are true) killed over 600 young girls making her the worst serial killer in history. LADY and our team were chosen for the 2015 Araca Project and the play will have six performances at the American Theatre of Actors from October 28th-November 1st.</span></h3> <ul> <li>Hi, I'm Sofya, and I am the executive producer and playwright of this project. I have a history of self-producing, from high school to my theatre major studies at Loyola Marymount University. I recently graduated with my MFA in playwriting and screenwriting from Northwestern University, where I produced the quarterly MasterClash! reading series, and was commissioned by Steep Theatre to write a new play. </li> <li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is a fast and furious campaign in which we hope to raise more funds to put towards the investment from the Araca Project and a grant from Northwestern. This last piece of contribution will be instrumental in renting rehearsal space, getting important set pieces (i.e. a bathtub), paying our devoted artists who are offering up a month or their dedicated time, and lighting and sound packages to make this a polished, beautiful and thrilling piece of theatre.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your donations will not only help us put on an incredibly effective, bold and beautiful show, but you will help ensure the future life of this production and help me make an impact on the theatrical world of New York City.</span><br/>

Be a part of something important and meaningful.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This is what your donation will ensure:</p> <ul> <li>On this campaign, we are asking for $1500, a smaller sum for a production of this scale but that would be imperative towards rehearsal space rental, important set pieces, payment of our artists, and lighting packages.</li> <li>We're offering free tickets to our New York City show, free refreshments during the production, unique pieces of production art, producing credits and other exciting perks.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Team</h3>

LADY is a new play about the lengths we go to for beauty and power. It's loosely based on Countess Bathory, who (if the rumors are true) killed over 600 young girls making her the worst serial killer in history. LADY and our team were chosen for the 2015 Araca Project and the play will have six performances at the American Theatre of Actors from October 28th-November 1st.  Hi, I'm Sofya, and I am the executive producer and playwright of this project. I have a history of self-producing, from high school to my theatre major studies at Loyola Marymount University. I recently graduated with my MFA in playwriting and screenwriting from Northwestern University, where I produced the quarterly MasterClash! reading series, and was commissioned by Steep Theatre to write a new play.  This is a fast and furious campaign in which we hope to raise more funds to put towards the investment from the Araca Project and a grant from Northwestern. This last piece of contribution will be instrumental in renting rehearsal space, getting important set pieces (i.e. a bathtub), paying our devoted artists who are offering up a month or their dedicated time, and lighting and sound packages to make this a polished, beautiful and thrilling piece of theatre.

Your donations will not only help us put on an incredibly effective, bold and beautiful show, but you will help ensure the future life of this production and help me make an impact on the theatrical world of New York City.
  If you can't make it out to see the show, consider donating to help us make our dreams for this production and its future life in New York City. Be a part of something important and meaningful.   What We Need & What You Get This is what your donation will ensure:  On this campaign, we are asking for $1500, a smaller sum for a production of this scale but that would be imperative towards rehearsal space rental, important set pieces, payment of our artists, and lighting packages. We're offering free tickets to our New York City show, free refreshments during the production, unique pieces of production art, producing credits and other exciting perks.    The Team
We are so excited about our incredible artists on this project.
Director & Producer: Will Arbery
Producer & Managing Director: Katie Cochran
PR: Emily Owens
Art/Marketing: Hayes Thornton
Cast: Lola Kelly, Eli Gelb & Sasha Diamond

<h3><i>The Haunting of Blaine Manor</i></h3>
<p><strong>England, 1953.</strong></p>
<p><strong>​Renowned American parapsychologist Doctor Roy Earle, famous for discrediting hauntings and exposing fake mediums, is invited to attend a seance in what is said to be the most haunted building in England, a building with a horrific history, Blaine Manor.

<h3>Who are we and what are we doing? </h3>
<p>I am <strong>Maddy Moore</strong> and I am the Artistic Director of <strong>The Thelmas</strong>, and director of <strong>LADYKILLER by Madeline Gould.  </strong></p>
<div>The Thelmas is a female-led theatre company which comprises of myself and my co-director, playwright, <strong>Guleraana Mir </strong>who is co-producing Ladykiller. The Thelmas was set up to develop and promote early career female writers, and this year, not satisfied with having completed our first National tour, we are going to be making our <strong>Edinburgh Fringe Debut</strong> with a rollercoaster of a one woman show,<strong> Ladykiller </strong>by a brilliantly audacious and talent playwright, <strong>Madeline Gould.</strong>  The play stars the unbelievably watchable London-based, Northern Irish actor, <strong>Hannah McClean</strong>, who is also making her fringe debut. </div>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><i>A chambermaid, a hotel room and a dead woman. It’s not what it looks like, really, it’s not. It was self-defence… and anyway the woman was asking for it</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>The chambermaid considers herself to be a pretty normal person; she reads books. She pretended to read the party manifestos at the General Election.  She’s even read The Psychopath Test and she’s pretty sure she’s not one so…</i></strong></p>
<p>Ladykiller is a blood-soaked morality tale about social responsibility, zero-hours contracts and tearing up the gender rule book on psychopathy; a jet-black comedy for the age of the gig economy.  It charts one woman's journey through victimhood, from violent oppression to bloody revolution.</p>
<p>It is  a <strong><i>comedy. </i></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why do we need you?</strong></h3>
<p>We are a pretty resilient bunch, but everyone needs someone right? So at this time, we need you to help us make Ladykiller the success it deserves to be. </p>
<p><strong>Edinburgh Fringe is HUGE</strong> - this year there are over <strong>3500 shows</strong> in town featuring 30,000+ performers. We are a small, but thriving 'young' theatre company with big ambitions. So far we have self-funded our productions on favours and our day-jobs, but more recently have been awarded grants from Arts Council England for Guleraana's recent play<strong> <a href=""http://www.pocketsizetheatre.com/2018/04/review-coconut-at-ovalhouse.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Coconut'</a></strong>.... twice! However, the Arts Council doesn't fund shows going to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and while we have some money made from touring to re-invest, <strong>we need to raise an additional £9k</strong> to ensure we have a successful, safe and sustainable run at the fringe and beyond.</p>
<p>However, it is more than that; by showing your support for us and our work, <strong>you will also contributing to the good will, buzz and excitement</strong> not only around the show, but also around us as an up-and-coming, female-led company which is smashing more than a few stereotypes, drawing in new and diverse audiences, and helping to support women to bring fresh stories to the UK theatre scene. We are interested in building a solid base for the company, and for this to happen <strong>we want people who are passionate about supporting the artists of the future - <i>that's you and us btw... </i>;o)</strong></p>
<p>Even a £1 or a share on your social media channels does this - nothing is too small and everything is hugely appreciated. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531327695/vjqyak3vroi8t0acm6ge.jpg"" src=""""/><strong>Your contribution will make a huge difference.</strong> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Our budget covers our production costs, like set and the construction of our 'victim'.... yes, a fake dead body basically. It will also go towards *really* sexy things like insurance, PRS and photocopying.</p>
<p>It covers travel and accommodation for the whole team.</p>
<p>In order to stand out from the crowd, our marketing budget is probably our biggest spend, but we feel that with our eye-catching image of Hannah, it is going to be really effective. </p>
<p>On top of this we want to be able to pay the team minimum Equity fringe rates - it's bloody hard work putting on a show so we believe that everyone should be paid as best we can. </p>
<p><strong>Let us break it down for you a bit more:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>£1 is 5 miles of petrol on our 402.5 mile drive to Edinburgh.</li>
<li>£10 pays for 60 mins of street flyering (x 2 hours per day for 27 days... well you can do the maths right?)</li>
<li>£30 will buy us an extra large bumper container of realistic looking and durable fake blood (plus a few packs of baby wipes to remove it from Hannah and the set after the show!)</li>
<li>£60 will cover the cost of Hannah's costume and spares</li>
<li>£100 hires us our extra lights to make Hannah look extra creepy!</li>
<li>£150 buys us a ultra sexy, large outdoor advertising board</li>
<li>£170 allows us to caption the show for the hearing impaired</li>
<li>£250 would allow us to film the show to help us book future tours</li>
<li>£300 covers the Fringe entry fee</li>
<li>£600 covers our venue's marketing contra</li>
<li>£1800 will cover our print advertising and digital marketing costs. </li>
<li>£2000 will pay for our accommodation for the full month of the fringe. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to become a commercially viable company, making theatre which entertains, but also encourages you to laugh your way into deeper conversation about the themes in the bar after the show.  Our work is best summed up by this quote from one reviewer:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>‘An all-female cast and crew making theatre that people like - maybe that's the best kind of feminism.'- <strong>View from the Gods</strong></i></p>
<p>Ladykiller is a show which we believe is genuinely different - we genuinely have never seen a character quite like her on stage before. Our protagonist is not likeable. She is not someone you can root for. She says and does the things we fantasise about doing only in our very deepest, darkest moments.  At a recent preview showing an audience member reacted thus,</p>
<p><strong><i>'I loved it. So dark it was like a beautiful black hole!'</i></strong></p>
<p>Ladykiller demonstrates very clearly how rare it is that we see women's capacity for violence and evil portrayed in the media.  At a time when we as a society are examining our gender roles more so than any other, this show taps into this conversation in a most unexpected way.</p>
<p><i>We think this is an important conversation worth having.</i> </p>
<p><strong>Our presence at the fringe will achieve three really clear aims:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To showcase our work allowing potential programmers to see it and meet us, thus maximising our future earning potential.</li>
<li>To allow us access to members of the industry we would never normally get to meet - this enables us to start to forge partnerships for both our production and participatory work.</li>
<li>To expose our work and the company to a wider National and International audience. </li>
</ul>

<p>We are thoroughly determined to make Edinburgh Fringe the next success on the ladder to us becoming a sustainable touring theatre company.  We have recent produced a very successful tour of Guleraana's play, 'Coconut', supported by<a href=""https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/artist-development/in-good-company"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>In Good Company</strong></a>, the East Midlands flagship artist support programme. Last year we were a<strong> <a href=""http://www.newdiorama.com/artist-support/for-supported-companies/emerging-companies-programme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Diorama Emerging company</a></strong>. Since 2016 we've been given time, advice, space, and opportunities by <strong><a href=""https://www.derbytheatre.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Derby Theatre</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.coliseum.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oldham Coliseum</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://www.parktheatre.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Park Theatre</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.ovalhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ovalhouse</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://space.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Space,</a></strong> <strong><a href=""http://www.newdiorama.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Diorama</a></strong>, <a href=""http://www.diorama-arts.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Old Diorama</strong></a>, <a href=""https://canalcafetheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Canal Cafe Theatre</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=""https://www.rada.ac.uk/about-us/womenrada/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RADA</a> </strong>so we feel that even though this is our fringe debut, we are a pretty safe bet in terms of our theatrical pedigree: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maddy (producer/director) was invited to be part of the <strong>Fringe Society's Emerging Producer Programme in 2017</strong> which allowed her to forge a relationship with our venue for this year and learn the ropes of producing at the biggest fringe festival in the world. Maddy has had recent successes as a director at the helm of project like 'Coconut' by Guleraana Mir and <strong>multiple OFFIE and Broadway World award nominated</strong>, 'The Awakening' by Julian Garner.</li>
<li>We have been chosen by <strong><a href=""https://www.pleasance.co.uk/event/ladykiller#overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Pleasance</a></strong> to be part of their programme - The Pleasance is one of 'the big four' venues on the fringe and in our books, the very best! </li>
<li>Maddie (writer) is a seasoned Edinburgh Fringe creative and has had recent critical acclaim with her immersive wartime drama, <a href=""https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/think-england-review-vaults-london/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><u>'Think of England'</u></strong> </a>at this year's Vault Festival and is Associate Writer for <a href=""https://www.aiawtc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Anonymous is a Woman</strong></a> theatre company. </li>
</ul>
<p>However, as a relatively new company while we have a good following in London and the surrounding area, within the wider industry we are not that well known... yet. This is something we want to change by going to the fringe. Both Maddy and Guleraana will be feet on the ground at as many industry events we can blag, bribe or burrow our way into - Maddy, having been Industry accredited last year now has the skinny on this and will be ready with her elevator pitch! </p>
<p>Likewise for developing our audience, this is a chance for us to share our work with a wider National and International audience base. We know our audience is likely to be young (20-35), digitally native and culturally curious, so we will be running a consistent witty and visually impactful social media campaign (see our trailer for example) through-out the fringe, as well as targeting our street flyering at the places these fringe-goers hang out.</p>

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>Love &amp; Pride is about 6 individuals who identify at different points along the spectrums of gender, sex, and sexuality, and the conflicts that arise within themselves and their relationships due to those identities.  The story is set during a summer in San Francisco, and we watch these characters go through profound changes against the backdrop of iconic San Francisco events like Bay2Breakers, Folsom Street Fair, and of course, Pride.</p>
<p>I started writing this story while I was in college majoring in theater, gender studies, and music.  to my dismay, I virtually never came across anything about queerness in the ways the ways that I or my friends experienced.  I found a deep lack of nuance, critical thinking, and representation...so I was inspired and determined to write songs that gave visibility to these identities, write a play that confronted these issues head on, and portray stories I have never seen on stage before.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>We are doing this crowdfunding campaign because have Love &amp; Pride booked at the SF LGBT Center for a 4 week run beginning this October.  This is so exciting because they are one of the leading organizations that fight for the community the play is about.</p>
<p>The amount we're raising is to cover the cost of renting the venue space, which is due before the show opens on October 18, 2018: Performances $480 per night x 4 nights =  $1920 + Technical Rehearsal $555 per night x 1 night = $555 = <strong>TOTAL NEEDED: $2475</strong></p>

<p>Inequality, prejudice, and violence against queer, trans and non-binary folks are still prevalent all over the world.  While this play centers on the topics of gender and sexuality, it is ultimately about the universal themes of finding your true self and learning to love others for who they truly are.  My hopes for this project that it fosters dialogue about complex and controversial topics, and creates awareness for marginalized communities - so that we can all relate to the struggles and joys of love, and be proud of that love, no matter how we identify</p>

<h3>Theater Costs Money</h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah... we've heard about the Poor Theater. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the Paying Theater. Padua Playwrights has been churning out avant-garde masterpieces for 40+ years. Ever heard of Sam Shepard? Murray Mednick? Marie Irene-Fornes? Well guess what? Writing is great, but we want to produce some large-scale, touring productions and pay actors a living wage.

</div><div>
<h3>History of Padua Playwrights</h3>
<p>In 1978, Murray Mednick and five other playwrights, including Sam Shepard and Maria Irene Fornes, converged on the old Padua Hills estate in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, just east of Los Angeles. The playwrights, as well as playwriting students and actors, were given free reign to re-investigate their creativity, developing writing exercises for the morning, rehearsing in the afternoon, and presenting the results in the evening.</p>
<p>Under Mednick’s artistic direction through 1995, the Festival and Workshop became a model that, staged annually, had a lasting impact on American theater. In 2001, under the artistic direction of playwright and director Guy Zimmerman, Padua began offering regular seasons of new work to critical acclaim. In its first ten seasons the company staged 28 productions, including three in New York City and three abroad, and garnered a host of LA Weekly, Garland, and Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle awards and an American Theatre Critics Association citation. Since 2003, the company has published six play anthologies, distributed nationally by Theatre Communications Group, including two new play anthologies slated for the Winter of 2012.</p>
<p>Among the many prominent playwrights to emerge from or be nurtured by Padua are: David Henry Hwang, John Steppling, John O’Keefe, Kelly Stuart, Jon Robin Baitz, Marlane Meyer, Guy Zimmerman, Wesley Walker, Julie Hebert, Susan Champagne, Sharon Yablon, Susan Mosakowski, and Joseph Goodrich, to name a few.</p>

Yeah, yeah, yeah... we've heard about the Poor Theater. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the Paying Theater. Padua Playwrights has been churning out avant-garde masterpieces for 40+ years. Ever heard of Sam Shepard? Murray Mednick? Marie Irene-Fornes? Well guess what? Writing is great, but we want to produce some large-scale, touring productions and pay actors a living wage. We want a theater company in an actual building where our actors, designers, writers, and directors are on staff and get health benefits. We also want a pony. We will care for the pony and treat the pony as if it were a member of the family. We shall call it ""Pony"" and it shall live a fine, fine life.

<p>This is a rare opportunity to sponsor a cross-cultural collaboration between American and Palestinian youth theatre artists. </p>
<p>We are the debut cohort of the<strong> <a href=""http://www.cooptheatreeast.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Co-Op Theatre East </a></strong>youth ensemble. We have been invited to attend the 2018<a href=""http://www.ashtar-theatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong>Ashtar Youth Theatre Festival </strong></a>in the West Bank where we will spend 10 days performing and participating in theatre education workshops with artists from across the world. </p>
<p>We are creating an original ensemble devised theatre piece on the theme of the festival, ascension.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $10,000 to help subsidize our plane fare and provide stipends to our hard-working young artists while going abroad this summer.

<p>The money raised by our Indiegogo Campaign will go directly to support our plane fare and provide small living stipends to our artists who are taking time off of work to attend the festival.

By funding this project, we will be able to focus on our work as opposed to working several jobs to pay off the tickets. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a rare opportunity to visit the West Bank and meet international artists and hear from artists that rarely get a voice on the American stage.

<p>Here's how it started:</p>
<p>The day after I saw that production of <i>Measure for Measure</i>, I was listless and depressed. I thought of the Isabella/Angelo scene and I cried. I texted my friend who I’d seen the show with and it turned out she had also been depressed all day and thought the show had triggered it.</p>
<p>It was an excellent production. It was moving and aesthetically exciting and it made me never want to see <i>Measure for Measure</i> again. As we walked away from the theatre, my friend and I – both of us lifelong Shakespeare nerds and passionate Shakespeare educators – talked about all the plays we may have had our fill of. This same company’s <i>Othello</i> had similarly given me a definitive production and made me never want to see <i>Othello</i> again. My friend had had her fill of <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream </i>after watching all of the women get humiliated so much while teaching it.</p>
<p>I was almost ready to just call it a day with Shakespeare. Like – really. I’m a playwright. To hell with it. I can write my own damn plays. I already do, in fact. I don’t need his anymore. You’ve loved something enough, you can let it go, right?</p>
<p>Then, at dinner, while I tried not to cry into my bi bim bap, my partner wondered if I’d feel similarly about <i>Measure for Measure</i> if instead of just silently accepting the Duke’s proposal, Isabella kicked him in the balls. I had to confess that that would have helped. And further suggestions of a bloody revolution at the end also cheered me right up. “As Isabella feeds The Duke into the wood chipper, a spray of blood covers the entire stage. End of play.” Wouldn’t need to change a single line of Shakespeare’s language and I would feel so much differently about this play.</p>
<p>And so – by the end of the night, I was scheming about how to do an experimental workshop to explore these ideas. I went from never wanting to see <i>Measure for Measure</i> again to wanting to direct it -  in the space of a day.</p>
<p>Over the last year the state of the world has been such that I haven’t had the will to make any theatre. But I was suddenly energized to seize hold of this play and shake it til it cries for mercy.</p>
<p>I had ten free hours of rehearsal space and a nimble adaptable theatre company. So, with no prep, no preamble and no waiting, I dove right in. It’s instant feminist theatre.</p>
<h3>So – if the space is free, why do we need money?</h3>
<p><br/>The artists who have signed on to explore this play need to be paid. This is a cast of all women and statistically women’s work is underpaid or unpaid. Please help me make this project different.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we were able to pay every woman just NY’s current minimum wage of $13 per hour, for the ten hours we’ll be in their presence, that’s $130 per actor. However, there is a lot of work happening when we're not seeing them as well. Let’s call it $200 per actor for just the bare minimum. This doesn’t include the cost that a lot of our actors are incurring due to the location of our “free” rehearsal space. In Soraya Chemaly’s book, <i>Rage Becomes Her</i>, she discusses the Safety Tax – which is a premium that women often pay to stay safe in a misogynistic world. Our actors are incurring a safety tax during this process. A highly conservative estimate of that tax – that is, taking a car service due to the fact that the area is not well trafficked or well lit is a further $75 per actor.</p>
<p>For the ten people we have involved already, $275 per person brings us to $2750. But – in the course of this process, it has become clear that we need a chorus of additional performers which we’ll bring in for subsequent rehearsal. So assuming we’ll have them for the remainder of our time and that they too will be in a position of paying the safety tax, we’ll need an additional $1750 – bringing our total to $4500 – just to pay everyone a minimum wage and safety tax.</p>
<p>And believe me, I want so much to be able to pay them so much more than minimum wage. I imagine you might, as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your donation is a vote for a more economically just feminist world.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s also a vote for a more process oriented world. Like our previous project (<i>The Door Was Open</i>) this is an exploration, Research and Development, a creative process and not a product. If you value such things, please consider making a donation.</p>
<p><br/>Will we raise the funds we need to pay these ladies sufficiently? I don’t know. Historically, Indie Theatre is underfunded,  women’s work is radically underfunded and explicitly feminist work even less so. Will things remain as they are or be transformed? It’s up to you.</p>

Will we raise the funds we need to pay these ladies sufficiently? I don’t know. Historically, Indie Theatre is underfunded,  women’s work is radically underfunded and explicitly feminist work even less so. Will things remain as they are or be transformed? It’s up to you.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h2>What is this project and why should I help fund it?</h2>
<p>Bow &amp; Arrow is a circus theater collective founded by four badass women: Marie &amp; Genie Cartier, Bethlayne Hansen and Madi Worthington. By combining our diverse backgrounds in circus, theater, production and design, we are taking on the patriarchy by creating our own original independent circus theatre productions. Our recent productions have been yearly installments of Saturnalia: A Raunchy Circus Christmas, a fun, sexy circus show inspired by the Pagan origins of Christmas.</p>
<p>The idea for “Dark Side of the Circus” was born many years ago when teenage circus performer Genie Cartier listened to Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” for the first time and thought “this should be a circus show.” The time for this idea has arrived. Not only is female leadership more needed than ever, a thoroughly entertaining and well-produced independent show is just what the doctor ordered in these dark times.</p>
<p>You should fund this show because artists deserve to be paid for their hard work. Because hard-working artists deserve to work in good conditions, wear fabulous costumes, and perform in a theater that can accommodate their needs. Because artists provide an invaluable service to our community and deserve to be recognized and compensated for it! Can I get an amen?</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>So here’s the deal:</p>
<p>We need $10,000 to give this show the treatment it deserves. To give you an idea of the costs, the theater rental alone for two weekends is $6000. The rest goes to production costs, publicity, and most importantly paying the cast &amp; crew!</p>
<p>We have some great perks, so take a look before you decide on an amount. Any donation over $100 includes one or more tickets to the show!</p>
<p>If we do not reach $10k, the funds we do raise will go towards the theater rental. That means everything else has to be borrowed against future ticket sales. It is very difficult to do this and pay artists fairly, so please help us reach our goal!</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We at Bow &amp; Arrow are intimately knowledgeable about the struggles of being a performer. Too often, we are forced to choose between meaningful, creative projects and projects that will pay. We want to change that norm. By contributing to this campaign, you are not only supporting one production, you are helping us shift the view of artists to a valuable demographic that deserves to be paid for their hard work like any other profession.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Want to contribute beyond your donation? Don’t have the funds, but still want to support us? Indiegogo makes it really easy to share the campaign across all platforms, so please help us get the word out!</p>

<p>Hello all, and thank you for stopping by our page!</p>
<p>The senior cohort in the Acting program at Utah State University is raising money to attend The Mountain West Actor Showcase on March 11, 2019. This showcase will be our launching point into the professional world. Every year casting directors, agents, managers, and other industry professionals are invited to our showcase. </p>
<p>Through this showcase, Utah State Alumni have made connections around the United States. Many have found work in regional theatres across the country. Some are living in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago pursuing their dreams on stage and in film. Multiple students have booked agents and managers through this showcase which help guarantee them future work. This is the fifth year students from Utah State will be traveling to New York, and each year the success of the showcase has grown exponentially. </p>
<p>The expected total cost for this trip is around $20,000 for eight students. We are in the process of raising money by selling concessions at USU theater shows and performing in cabarets. We have also applied for several sources of university funding.</p>
<p>With the holiday season in full bloom, we wanted to give our friends and family an easy way to donate to our project. Any donations will go toward headshots, printing and distribution costs, travel to and from New York City, hotel rooms, and the rental of the theatre, accompanist, and piano for our performances.</p>
<p> If we are lucky enough to raise money beyond the essentials, any extra fundraising will go toward the further artistic education of the actors. Some students have never been to New York and would like to take this opportunity to indulge in the history of the city. Others are planning to attend advanced classes to get a taste of what will be available after graduation. Most would like to see at least one Broadway show while they are in such a brilliant theatre hub.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any donation. No amount is too small. If you are unable to contribute in this way, please share the link to our campaign. You can also support us by purchasing concessions at any Utah State Theatre production, or by attending the Last Chance Cabaret in early February. </p>
<p>Thank you again!</p>

<p>Hi!  I'm Candice Oden, major star of stage, screen, and television.  Why have you not heard of me?  ... Well, maybe I'm not a major star -- that was misleading.  I am a singer/actor, though, who has been performing professionally for 27 years in all realms of the entertainment industry.  With the exception of mime.</p>
<p>I have created a musical evening of fun and drama that I have been working on off and on for a couple of years.  It's a free workshop production of my solo show that's very important to me -- it's important for me to tell my story so that people can get a glimpse of what it's like dealing with mental illness.  It's an area that I'm very passionate about, and it's time I did something about it, in a way that only I can.  And your contributions can make this dream I've had a reality.  If I open the eyes of even one person to the truth about bipolar disorder, I will have done my job.  And you can help make that happen!</p>
<p>I need to raise $2,000 to get this thing up and running.  That will help cover the costs of my musical director, my director, props, a sparse set, and sound equipment.  The Seeing Place is generously providing the space and stage manager, so those are covered.  Woohoo!  Naturally, as any good IndieGoGo campaign does, I have perks!  These very high class and expensive perks range from a shout out and stick figure drawings, all the way to an evening with Candice Oden at Taco Bell.  And don't worry, if these perks aren't exciting enough and I don't reach my goal, the funds are still going to this project.  Whether you can donate $1 or $2,000, your contribution means the world to me.  This show is so important to me.  And anything helps.</p>
<p>If you are also a starving artist and $1 is too much (I get it), spreading the word about the show and this campaign will have a huge impact.</p>
<p>Oh!  And did I mention -- this show is going to be free to the public!  That's one reason why this campaign is so important -- because I'll be making no money from the box office to cover costs.</p>
<p>The show is performing Wednesday, January 16th at 3pm and Saturday, January 19th at 5pm.</p>
<p>Come and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>The Saskatoon International Burlesque Festival will celebrate its first year at the Broadway Theatre in Saskatoon SK October 3-6 2019. The SIBF aims to produce the first ever, top quality, weekend-long professional Burlesque Festival in SK. The festival will include but not be limited to 2 full-scale performance showcases and a day of professional development workshops. We are pleased to co-produce the festival with The Broadway Theatre.</p>
<p>The SIBF’s goal is to include a wide variety of talented performers including people of colour, first nation people, people of all genders and variations, performers of a variety of ages, sizes, backgrounds, beliefs and sexual orientations. We will provide a safe space for artistic expression, performance and training opportunities. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Announcing our festival headliner </strong></h2>

<p>While some performers “burst” onto the burlesque scene, Ava Lure’s ascent has resembled more of a high-viscosity ooze of angst and ardour. Performing burlesque since 2010, Ava has graced the stages of Wasabassco Burlesque NYC, the Vancouver International Burlesque Festival, Toronto Burlesque Festival, Edmonton Burlesque Festival, Texas Burlesque Festival, Minneapolis Burlesque Festival, and with Screaming Chicken Theatrical Society, the Burlesque Hall of Fame Weekender. Ava is currently a member of Pandora &amp; The Locksmiths, an instructor with Screaming Chicken Theatrical Society, and the Creative Director and Founder of The Crystalline Cabaret.</p>
<p>With a strong commitment to incorporating artistic education into her creative practice, Ava has a Diploma in Theatre as well as Alumni Award for Community Service from Douglas College, an Advanced Certiﬁcate in Arts &amp; Entertainment Management and Bachelor of Performing Arts from Capilano University, and has studied Viewpoints Movement Improvisation from the Banff Centre for the Arts. Ava served on the board of the Vancouver International Burlesque festival for three years and was President in 2015. As a part of East Vancouver’s larger artistic community, Ava often collaborates with photographers, video and theatre artists, dancers, and designers on various projects outside of burlesque. Blending theatricality with timeless grace every time she hits the stage, her intoxicating movements lure you into her dream world.</p>

<p>Based out of Chicago, Dahlia Fatale is a travelling contortionist,  burlesque performer and instructor. Dahlia's performances combine the smoothness of classical dance training with the bizarre and superhuman styling of contortion. She has been featured at prestigious events across the US and Canada and loves bringing her unique art form to new and different audiences. As an artist, Dahlia loves to create characters which play with the boundaries (both physical and emotional) of burlesque and perception versus reality of humans. Regardless of the act she puts on that night, she's guaranteed to always bend your mind with her body!</p>
<p>The festival will also present 28 other performers from around the globe! You can keep your eye on our website at <a href=""https://saskatooninternationalburlesquefestival.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://saskatooninternationalburlesquefestival.com/</a> for line up announcements. </p>

<p>As you can imagine there is an awful lot that goes into producing a multi-day large scale event like this, especially for the first time! The Burlesque Festival and the Broadway Theatre are working hard to raise enough funds to cover the travel, accommodation and performance costs for our Headliner and Co-feature, theatre rentals and technician wages as well as our advertising costs. We also will guarantee each of our other 28 performers a performance fee, aid with finding billeting for out of town artists and provide affordable workshop/training opportunities with our stars. </p>
<p>We are a small independent group of burlesque fans partnering with a local not for profit to take the risk to produce the festival this season. Our production budget is just over $18,000 and through both our ticket sales and our fundraising initiatives like this one we hope that the festival is successful enough to ensure the future of the event!</p>

<p>Amanda here. I started this company a year ago for one reason:</p>
<p>THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH FEMALE WRITER/ PRODUCERS IN NEW YORK (or anywhere), making original content- comedies, dramas, avant-garde circus acts- with FEMALE MAIN CHARACTERS. We should be HALF of the population of creators and right now we're about a quarter. </p>
<p><font>""Family Business"" is headed by an amazing all-female production team comprised of Amanda Murphy, Amanda Jayne, Francesca Day, and honorary female Christopher Matos. </font></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>Rehearsal space rental: $1500</li>
<li>Set Design + Set Construction: $2000</li>
<li>Costume/ Props: $1000</li>
<li>Stage Management/ Crew: $1000</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone else is (AMAZINGLY) working for free but we WILL pay them if we exceed our fundraising goal. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>Our production staff, directors, writers, artists, and cast are entirely NEW talent heading off a NEW play. Starting from the ground floor isn't easy. We could make another remake of the Lion King which would guarantee us millions of dollars at the box office. We value ORIGINALITY, OPPORTUNITY, and GROWTH AS ARTISTS. </p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let's be honest. It's many of our first times producing an Off-Off-Broadway play. It could suck. </p>
<p>But guess what? It won't. First of all, we've got Francesca Day, who is the Goddess of Off-Off-Broadway. The rest of us have produced a half dozen short plays in NYC festivals this year alone. From the PIT Loft to the Tank, we're beloved everywhere. (We brag more on youupproductions.com)</p>

<p>“<i>Weekend in Eden</i> is a brilliantly comedic and honest three act play which pins sister against sister as they fight for a ring their grandmother said would bring them good fortune. The comedy, in combination with characters so human in their flaws, fears, and love, make this play a clear stand out in the competition. Bravo!” </p>
<p>                     – AFF Script Reader Notes</p>
<p>“This script gave me plenty of moments of laughter, imagination, and empathy, which ultimately made this work so well-rounded. It’s a well-crafted story about making the best decisions for ourselves and going through multiple hurdles just to get what we want.”                                                                          – AFF Script Reader Notes</p>
<p>“The play’s plot revolves around the contest for the pseudo-magical ring La Broma; however, just as the sister’s fight is not truly about a ring, so too is the plot of this play not reduced to a simple conquest. Rather, through the battle for the ring, each character’s secrets, desires, and fears are uncovered and they most come to terms with those realities: both with themselves and each other…The humor in this piece is incredible and it’s so carefully balanced with serious conversations.”                                                                                       </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This year, <i><strong>The Argentinian Prostitute Play</strong></i> will receive its world premiere at the Broadway Bound Theatre Festival - an honor granted only to 20 works out a massive pool of submissions. This premiere provides us with the opportunity to present a little-known moment of Jewish history to a wider audience that we've been researching and developing for nearly a year. It's time for us to tell this story on stage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our performance dates will be: </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Tuesday, August 20th @ 8pm </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Wednesday, August 21st @ 5pm </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Saturday, August 24th @ 2pm</strong></p>
<p>This will be a fully staged production with a cast of seven. The show runs about 90 minutes with no intermission. </p>
<p>Our cast will include: Nahar Aminov, Anja Avsharian (Beauty and the Beast, Player's Theatre), Mateo Ervin, Bruce Jimenez, Ben Natan (The Trial of Mrs. Surratt, Wandering Theatre Co.), Bella O'Brien, and Shawn Zylberberg.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to raise a total of $7400, to be able fund the entire project from casting to rehearsal to the stage. Our budget breakdown is as follows: </p>

<p><strong>Miguel Ferrerossa </strong></p>
<p>Miguel is 23 and was born in the Aguablanca district, one of the most socially problematic sectors in Cali, Colombia. However, this community stands out for its joy transmitted through dance and music, where salsa is the protagonist.</p>
<p>Miguel began dancing professionally at the age of 17 and is now a professional dancer, instructor and choreographer. For the past four years, he has danced in Cali’s Salsódromo, a parade gathering the best professional salsa dancers in Cali and around the world.</p>
<p>A young man who, with his talent, skill and discipline reached a high level in a short amount of time. He excels as much dancing men’s style and women’s style.</p>
<p>He has performed in many shows and competed in international competitions such as the Mundial de Salsa de Cali. His teachers held him in such high esteem that he became the example for several groups of dancers in different schools. He helped many young girls and professional dancers grow artistically and always received positive feedback on his teaching methods.</p>
<p>He was a teacher in several dance schools up until January 2018, when he decided to start his own business as a personal brand.</p>
<p>From there on, he began his process of dancing in heels, wanting to promote this activity as a contribution to society to foster respect and acceptance of the LGBT community.</p>

<p><strong>Charlotte Charbonnier</strong></p>
<p>Charlotte is 30 and was born in Geneva, Switzerland. She graduated from a private journalism school in Paris and then worked for four years as a production manager for an audio-visual company in Switzerland.</p>
<p>However, Charlotte felt that the life she had was not satisfying enough and she felt the impulse to focus on herself. Therefore, she decided to find new life goals and ways to express her creativity. At 28, she decided to quit her job and started a course in video editing and graphic design.</p>
<p>She then started working as a freelancer, developing her own style. She takes care of everything from organizing to directing, and filming to editing her videos according to what her clients are looking for.</p>
<p>In April 2018, she decided to buy a one-way ticket to Havana, to embrace the love she has for dancing and traveling. She spent a month taking dance classes and practicing every day. She then found work volunteering in a salsa school in Cali, exchanging her videography skills for accommodation and salsa classes. Initially, she thought she’d only stay for a few weeks but little did she know, the Salsa Capital would end up being her home for the next 8 months.</p>
<p>It was Cali which gave her the opportunity to meet Miguel Ferrerossa, her salsa teacher. With whom she improves her dance technique daily and works hand-in-hand with the production and creation of #YoMeEntacono. Today she is the one behind the scenes, producing content and making this initiative more visible in order to achieve the goal of the proposed crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE START OF THE PROJECT #YOMEENTACONO</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550776566/qxqhwnsp6acwsuyk8c2a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It was a night of June 2018 at an iconic bar in Cali, that Charlotte saw Miguel's unique style for the first time and decided to take classes with him. They had many things in common and quickly became very good friends. That's how they decided to put together his talent and her creativity to produce outstanding dance videos in iconic spots in the city.</p>
<p>In the midst of this desire to do something innovative and out of the ordinary, they had the idea of producing a video of Miguel dancing salsa caleña in heels. This was his chance to express one of his passions.</p>
<p><i>""We chose to go to an iconic place in the city, put on a costume and a pair of heels. When we arrived at the shooting location, an atmosphere of mockery was noticed <s>in</s> among some of the spectators who were there.""</i>- Miguel said.</p>
<p>Noticing the reaction of the spectators, Miguel felt the lack of empathy that exists in Cali towards diversity and the negative impact it has on society. <i>"" Salsa caleña is a rhythm that I love and adore, it's the dance of our grandparents and it’s traditional. That's why I decided to put on my high heels and dared to make this video with my team, to prove that as a society, we are evolving daily. And also, that it’s not acceptable that throughout 2017, more than 105 people have been killed because of this disease called homophobia.”</i></p>
<div> </div>
<p>Together they want to demonstrate that it doesn't matter your background, your skin tone, your age, your preferences, whether you're straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Together, we can all join forces to deliver a message of tolerance and have a positive impact on society. Let’s make it a place where people dance to celebrate diversity without fear.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE FIRST STAGE OF #YOMEENTACONO IN CALI</strong></h3>
<p>The project #YoMeEntacono was officially launched in Cali, Colombia in January 2019, with the creation of two dance crews called the ""Ferrerossa Heels Crews"".</p>
<p>The groups going ranging from level basic-intermediate to intermediate-advanced, included both men and women who decided to dance in heels and give a voice to those who are scared of being crushed morally in a macho society.</p>
<p>After two months of workshops, the dance crew that gathered over 40 people each week, did a closing performance in Cali’s most iconic salsa bar “La Topa Tolondra”.</p>
<p>#YoMeEntacono’s team is now focusing on making the trip to Europe achievable, in order to grow on an international scale. </p>

<h3><strong>WHY A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN? </strong></h3>
<p>Living in a conservative country like Colombia, where several of your conceptions have been forged for many years by the church, makes it hard for the LGBT community or anyone who goes against tradition.</p>
<p>Up to this day, many of them suffer daily discrimination and in some cases, persecution. Studies show that transgender women pay the highest price as they have the biggest homicide rate and a life expectancy of only 35 years.</p>
<p>Miguel Ferrerossa comes from a low-income family where men are forbidden to act like women, let alone dance like them. However, he decided to swim against the current and through dancing found a supportive and caring community that accepts him as he is. Feeling supported and not judged by his sexual orientation, Miguel eventually decided to start the #YoMeEntacono movement to generate a positive impact on the city. To make it a place where a man can dance salsa caleña in heels and therefore open minds every step of the way and even encourage those who still don't dare to do it. An action perceived by many as a stupendous talent and an experiment to break taboos.</p>
<p>That's why we want to show a face of diversity from an evolving country and how it’s starting to accept the LGBTI community more and more. We are promoting ourselves as a gay-friendly destination and showing how the people, the joy, the rhythms, the gastronomy and the salsa that Cali has is a means to celebrate diversity, at a city level and soon a world level.</p>
<p>The funds we have gathered so far are not enough to cover the budget of this somewhat ambitious dream. That's why we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign with the goal of bringing more people together around the world who want to share our message and join our cause, by contributing financially or spreading the word.</p>
<p>The closer we get to our funding goal of 16'000Euros, the more we will be able to accomplish. Let's build this adventure together! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WILL THE FUNDS RAISED BE USED FOR?</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s why we need a minimum of 4’000€ to be able to fulfil this project:</p>
<ul><li>International Flights (for 2 people): between 2’000 - 3’000€</li></ul>

WHAT IS THE #YOMEENTACONO PROJECT?
#YoMeEntacono is a project that strives to bring the salsa and caleña culture around the world with a message of diversity and gender equality by supporting the empowerment and inclusion of both women and the LGBT community. We fight so that seeing a man dance in heels will not be an object of hatred anymore.
The project started in January 2019 in Cali, Colombia and has the ambition to grow around the world starting in European cities.
The project is currently trying to raise funds through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo: https://igg.me/at/yomeentacono
The goal is to raise a minimum of 4’000€ before the 28th of April 2019, in order to travel one month in June 2019, to two European cities.

 
WHERE IS #YOMEENTACONO PLANNING TO GO?
1.         Geneva, Switzerland – 6th to 20th of June 2019 (15 days)
Location for events & Workshops: Geneva Urban Shape Studio
2.         Paris, France – 20th of June to 3rd of July 2019 (15 days)
Location for events & Workshops: Le Théâtre les 5 Diamants
 
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A #YOMEENTACONO EVENT?

An opening speech written by Miguel, talking about his own life experience growing up in a poor and dangerous neighborhood, facing homophobic and macho attacks throughout his life. He explains how salsa has positively influenced and encouraged acceptance and respect around the different forms of expressing himself.
Projection of a short documentary produced by Charlotte, putting Cali on the map so that it gets recognition for its dance style and highlights its potential as a diverse global city.
Inviting the audience to take part in an introduction class of salsa caleña.
Closing the event by show of salsa caleña in heels choreographed by Miguel

The #YoMeEntacono events will be open to all public and free of charge.

 
OTHER GOALS PLANNED DURING THE TRIP

To hold several dance workshops including traditional and unique styles (Salsa, Pachanga Caleño Fusion, Chacha Caleño, Lady Style, Salsa Heels, etc.)
To offer students private & group dance classes
To produce dance videos in heels in iconic places in Europe and spread the #YoMeEntacono challenge.
To produce of a documentary to be released after the trip
To start an online platform so that the #YoMeEntacono community can learn salsa caleña from anywhere in the world.

 
THE TEAM BEHIND THE PROJECT

Miguel Ferrerossa 
Miguel is 23 and was born in the Aguablanca district, one of the most socially problematic sectors in Cali, Colombia. However, this community stands out for its joy transmitted through dance and music, where salsa is the protagonist.
Miguel began dancing professionally at the age of 17 and is now a professional dancer, instructor and choreographer. For the past four years, he has danced in Cali’s Salsódromo, a parade gathering the best professional salsa dancers in Cali and around the world.
A young man who, with his talent, skill and discipline reached a high level in a short amount of time. He excels as much dancing men’s style and women’s style.
He has performed in many shows and competed in international competitions such as the Mundial de Salsa de Cali. His teachers held him in such high esteem that he became the example for several groups of dancers in different schools. He helped many young girls and professional dancers grow artistically and always received positive feedback on his teaching methods.
He was a teacher in several dance schools up until January 2018, when he decided to start his own business as a personal brand.
From there on, he began his process of dancing in heels, wanting to promote this activity as a contribution to society to foster respect and acceptance of the LGBT community.

Charlotte Charbonnier
Charlotte is 30 and was born in Geneva, Switzerland. She graduated from a private journalism school in Paris and then worked for four years as a production manager for an audio-visual company in Switzerland.
However, Charlotte felt that the life she had was not satisfying enough and she felt the impulse to focus on herself. Therefore, she decided to find new life goals and ways to express her creativity. At 28, she decided to quit her job and started a course in video editing and graphic design.
She then started working as a freelancer, developing her own style. She takes care of everything from organizing to directing, and filming to editing her videos according to what her clients are looking for.
In April 2018, she decided to buy a one-way ticket to Havana, to embrace the love she has for dancing and traveling. She spent a month taking dance classes and practicing every day. She then found work volunteering in a salsa school in Cali, exchanging her videography skills for accommodation and salsa classes. Initially, she thought she’d only stay for a few weeks but little did she know, the Salsa Capital would end up being her home for the next 8 months.
It was Cali which gave her the opportunity to meet Miguel Ferrerossa, her salsa teacher. With whom she improves her dance technique daily and works hand-in-hand with the production and creation of #YoMeEntacono. Today she is the one behind the scenes, producing content and making this initiative more visible in order to achieve the goal of the proposed crowdfunding campaign.
 
THE START OF THE PROJECT #YOMEENTACONO

It was a night of June 2018 at an iconic bar in Cali, that Charlotte saw Miguel's unique style for the first time and decided to take classes with him. They had many things in common and quickly became very good friends. That's how they decided to put together his talent and her creativity to produce outstanding dance videos in iconic spots in the city.
In the midst of this desire to do something innovative and out of the ordinary, they had the idea of producing a video of Miguel dancing salsa caleña in heels. This was his chance to express one of his passions.
""We chose to go to an iconic place in the city, put on a costume and a pair of heels. When we arrived at the shooting location, an atmosphere of mockery was noticed in among some of the spectators who were there.""- Miguel said.
Noticing the reaction of the spectators, Miguel felt the lack of empathy that exists in Cali towards diversity and the negative impact it has on society. "" Salsa caleña is a rhythm that I love and adore, it's the dance of our grandparents and it’s traditional. That's why I decided to put on my high heels and dared to make this video with my team, to prove that as a society, we are evolving daily. And also, that it’s not acceptable that throughout 2017, more than 105 people have been killed because of this disease called homophobia.”
 
Together they want to demonstrate that it doesn't matter your background, your skin tone, your age, your preferences, whether you're straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Together, we can all join forces to deliver a message of tolerance and have a positive impact on society. Let’s make it a place where people dance to celebrate diversity without fear.

THE FIRST STAGE OF #YOMEENTACONO IN CALI
The project #YoMeEntacono was officially launched in Cali, Colombia in January 2019, with the creation of two dance crews called the ""Ferrerossa Heels Crews"".
The groups going ranging from level basic-intermediate to intermediate-advanced, included both men and women who decided to dance in heels and give a voice to those who are scared of being crushed morally in a macho society.
After two months of workshops, the dance crew that gathered over 40 people each week, did a closing performance in Cali’s most iconic salsa bar “La Topa Tolondra”.
#YoMeEntacono’s team is now focusing on making the trip to Europe achievable, in order to grow on an international scale.

WHY A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN? 
Living in a conservative country like Colombia, where several of your conceptions have been forged for many years by the church, makes it hard for the LGBT community or anyone who goes against tradition.
Up to this day, many of them suffer daily discrimination and in some cases, persecution. Studies show that transgender women pay the highest price as they have the biggest homicide rate and a life expectancy of only 35 years.
Miguel Ferrerossa comes from a low-income family where men are forbidden to act like women, let alone dance like them. However, he decided to swim against the current and through dancing found a supportive and caring community that accepts him as he is. Feeling supported and not judged by his sexual orientation, Miguel eventually decided to start the #YoMeEntacono movement to generate a positive impact on the city. To make it a place where a man can dance salsa caleña in heels and therefore open minds every step of the way and even encourage those who still don't dare to do it. An action perceived by many as a stupendous talent and an experiment to break taboos.
That's why we want to show a face of diversity from an evolving country and how it’s starting to accept the LGBTI community more and more. We are promoting ourselves as a gay-friendly destination and showing how the people, the joy, the rhythms, the gastronomy and the salsa that Cali has is a means to celebrate diversity, at a city level and soon a world level.
The funds we have gathered so far are not enough to cover the budget of this somewhat ambitious dream. That's why we decided to start a crowdfunding campaign with the goal of bringing more people together around the world who want to share our message and join our cause, by contributing financially or spreading the word.
The closer we get to our funding goal of 16'000Euros, the more we will be able to accomplish. Let's build this adventure together! 
 
WHAT WILL THE FUNDS RAISED BE USED FOR?
Here’s why we need a minimum of 4’000€ to be able to fulfil this project:
International Flights (for 2 people): between 2’000 - 3’000€
From Cali to Geneva - From Paris to Cali
Train Tickets (for 2 people): between 80 - 200€
From Geneva to Paris
Daily costs including food, transportation and miscellaneous:
Average of 60€ per day for 2 people
60€ x 30days = 1’800€

Accommodation in Geneva: No costs (staying with family)
Accommodation in Paris: No costs (staying with friends) 

We hope to spread this around the world, thank you very much for joining our community and sharing this message with your friends.
We would appreciate any kind of contribution, no matter how big or small, we believe that with everyone’s help we can make this dream a reality.

el hombre ve con su corazón</h4>
<p>
Hungría
es el país que se extiende en el centro de Europa, y según muchos
aquí late el Chacra del Corazón de la Tierra. De aquél planeta que
brinda hogar a toda la humanidad, pero a pesar de eso unos quitan el
hogar, la comida, la vida, la familia de los otros. Nosotros, los
húngaros, sabemos como es cuando nos quitan nuestro hogar, y un día
despertamos como extraños en nuestra tierra natal.</p>
<p>
Y
a pesar de eso somos nosotros los que erigimos reja de alambre ante
el rostro de las personas aterradas. Somos nosotros los que de la
Barraca más Alegre nos convertimos en la mancha de deshonra de
Europa. Fuimos nosotros los que oficializamos el odio y la exclusión.</p>
<p>
¡No,
no fuimos nosotros! Nosotros no nos identificamos con los que le dan
una patada a los que yacen en el suelo. Nosotros somos los que vemos
con el corazón, y no miramos con el rabo del ojo al mundo a través
de nuestro miedo. Nosotros somos los que sienten, comprenden el
peligro y la trampa, el cual está en acecho sobre nosotros y sobre
Europa, y a pesar de eso podemos seguir siendo Personas.</p>
<p>
Vemos
con nuestro corazón, y nuestra atención pasa sobre tales detalles,
como que cuanto mide exactamente el día de hoy la valla de alambre.
Por eso es, que recolectamos 275.000 dólares en vez de 175.000. La
Sabiduría Universal nos enseñó, que a que conlleva cuando el
hombre ve con el corazón y no con su ego. ""Por casualidad""
empezamos a recaudar más de lo que fue nuestra intención original.
Esto tiene fuerza. No lo vamos a deshacer, y no lo vamos a
rectificar. Porque nosotros vemos con el corazón: lo esencial.</p>
<p>Para
275.000 metros de alambre de espino es 275.000 dólares de amor
nuestra respuesta.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4>Wenn der Mensch mit seinem Herzen sieht</h4><p>Ungarn ist jenes Land, welches in der Mitte Europas liegt und der Ort an dem vielen nach das Herzchakra unserer Erde schlägt. Das jenes Planeten, welcher das zu Hause aller Menschen ist, auf welchem dennoch der Eine das Zuhause, das Essen, das Leben oder gar die Familie des Anderen wegnimmt. Wir Ungarn wissen, was für ein Gefühl es ist, wenn man seiner Heimat beraubt wird und eines Tages als in unserer eigenen Heimat als Fremde aufwachen. </p><p>Dennoch sind es gerade wir, die einen Stacheldrahtzaun vor den furchterflößten Gesichtern Anderer ziehen. Wir sind es, die aus der „muntersten Baracke“ zum Schandfleck Europas geworden sind. Wir sind diejenigen, welche Hass und Ausgrenzung für offiziell erklärt haben. </p><p>Nein, das sind nicht wir, die so geworden sind! Wir sind nicht gleich jenen, welche die am Boden liegenden weiter treten. Wir sind jene, welche mit ihren Herzen sehen und nicht von hinter ihren Ängsten auf die Welt hinausschielen. Wir sind jene, die die Gefahr und Falle spüren und verstehen, welche auf uns und Europa lauert und dennoch menschlich bleiben können.</p><p>Wir sind jene, welche mit ihren Herzen sehen und deren Aufmerksamkeit vorübergleitet daran wie lang der Stacheldrahtzaun am heutigen Tage gerade ist. Deshalb konnte es passieren, dass wir 275.000 Dollar gesammelt haben, anstelle der geplanten 175.000. Die universelle Weisheit hat gezeigt, was passiert, wenn der Mensch mit seinem Herzen sieht, und nicht nur mit seinem Ego. „Ausversehen“ haben wir mehr Spenden gesammelt, als wir es geplant hatten. Dies bedeutet Kraft. Wir wollen das nicht rückgängig machen und nicht korrigieren. Denn wir sehen mit unseren Herzen: das Wesentliche. </p><p>Auf die 275.000 Meter Stacheldrahtzaun heißt unsere Antwort 275.000 Dollar voller Liebe.</p><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><h4>Quando la gente vede con il cuore</h4><p>Ungheria é il paese, che si estende in mezzo dell’Europa, e tanti lo credono che qui pulsa il chakra di cuore (anahataciakra) della Terra. Di quella pianeta, che dá una patria a tutta la gente, eppure uno toglie la casa, il cibo, la famiglia dell’altro. Noi ungheresi lo sappiamo, come é quando qualcuno toglie la nostra casa, ed un giorno svegliamo come stranieri nella nostra terra di nascita.</p><p>Eppure siamo noi, che tiriamo un recinto di filo spinato davanti la faccia della gente terrorizzata. Siamo noi, che dalla „Baracca piú Allegra del Campo” siamo divenuti una macchia d’infama dell Europa. Siamo noi che avevamo ufficializzato l’odio e l’espulsione dei „differenti”.</p><p>Ma no, non siamo noi! Noi non siamo identici con quelli che vorrebbero dare un calcio alla persona che si estende sulla terra. Noi siamo quelli che vedono con il cuore, non guardiamo il mondo attraverso il velo della nostra paura. Noi siamo quelli, che sentono il puzzo del pericolo e delle trappole, che ci circondano – eppure siamo capaci a rimanere Umani.</p><p>Noi guardiamo con il cuore, e superiamo la domanda, quanti metri farebbe la lunghezza di quel recinto. Per questo é stato deciso di fare una colletta di 275 mila dollari invece di 175 mila.</p><p>La Somma Sapienza Universale ci ha fatto vedere, com’é quando uno vede con il suo cuore e non con il suo Ego. „Per sbaglio” abbiamo iniziato a raccogliere di piú della nostra idea iniziale. Peró questa ha una forza. Non ci ritiriamo, e non facciamo neanche la correzione. Perché con il cuore noi vediamo: la sostanza.</p><p>La nostra risposta ai 275 mila metri di fili spinati saranno 275 mila dollari di caritá.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4></h4><h4>Quand on voit avec le cœur</h4><p>La Hongrie est un pays situé au centre de l’Europe, et beaucoup pensent que c’est ici que le Chakra du cœur de la Terre palpite, cette Terre qui accueille tous les Hommes ; malgré cela, parfois un homme prend la  vie, la maison, la nourriture, la famille de l’autre. Nous les Hongrois, nous savons ce que signifie être privé de son habitation, de se réveiller un jour étranger dans sa propre patrie.</p><p>Et ce sont quand-même nous ceux qui posons des fils de fer barbelés devant le visage de personnes apeurées. Sur la carte de l’Europe nous sommes passés de « la plus heureuse caserne » à la tâche déshonorante. Nous sommes ceux qui ont officialisé la haine et l’exclusion.</p><p>Mais non ! Nous ne sommes pas ceux-là! Nous ne sommes pas comme ceux  qui donneraient un coup de pied à une personne couchée par terre. Nous sommes ceux qui voient avec le cœur et qui ne voient pas le monde uniquement à travers la peur. Nous sommes ceux qui sentent et comprennent le danger et la piège, auxquels nous sommes exposés, nous et l’Europe, mais sommes quand même capables rester Humains.  </p><p>Nous voyons avec le cœur, et les détails tels que la longueur actuelle des fils de fer barbelés ne retiennent pas notre attention. C’est pour cela que nous collectons 275.000 dollars au lieu des 175.000 prévus. La sagesse universelle a montré où conduit quand on voit avec son cœur et non pas avec son ego. « Par hasard » nous avons commencé à collecter plus d’argent que prévu. Ce hasard a du pouvoir. Nous ne retirons pas, ne rectifions pas le montant. Car nous voyons avec le cœur : c’est là l’essentiel.</p><p>Aux fils de fer barbelés d’une longueur de 275.000 mètres nous répondons par 275.000 dollars d’amour.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h4>Когда человек видит сердцем</h4><p>Венгрия - это страна, которая расположена в середине Европы, и где по мнению многих пульсирует Сердечная чакра Земли. То есть той Планеты, которая является общим домом для всех человечества, но всё равно одни люди отбирают у других жилище, еду, жизнь, семью. Мы, венгры, знаем, как это, когда нас лишают наших домов и наступает такой день, когда мы просыпаемся чужими на земле, на которой мы родились.</p><p>Но опять же, это мы - те, кто натягивает колючую проволоку перед лицами перепуганных до смерти людей. Это мы - те, кто из «Самого весёлого барака» Европы стали её стыдом. Мы стали теми, кто официально декларировал ненависть и непринятие.</p><p>Нет, такими стали не мы! Нас нельзя путать с теми, кто пинает ногой лежащих на земле. Мы те, кто видит сердцем, а не украдкой смотрит на мир, видя свои страхи. Мы те, кто чувствует и понимает опасности и ловушки, которые подстерегают нас и Европу, но всё равно смогли остаться Людьми.</p><p>Мы видим сердцем, и из нашего внимания выпадают такие детали как сколько метров составляет точная длина ограды из колючей проволоки на сегодняшний день. Поэтому получилось так, что мы стали собирать 275 000 долларов вместо 175 000. Всеобщая Мудрость показала, к чему приводит, когда человек видит сердцем, а не своим эго. «Случайно» получилось так, что мы начали собирать больше, чем первоначально намеревались. У этого есть сила. Мы не повернём это вспять и не будет исправлять. Потому что своими сердцами мы видим суть.</p><p>На 275 000 метров колючей проволоки наш ответ - 275 000 долларов любви</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

الذين جعلنا الكراهية والإقصاء رسمياً.

لا،
نحن لسنا هكذا!
نحن
لسنا من الذين يدوسون على الراقدين على
الأرض.
نحن
الذين نرى بقلوبنا ولا ننظر إلى العالم
عبر مخاوفنا.
نحن
الذين نحس ونفهم الخطر والفخ اللذان
يتربصان بأوروبا، ومع ذلك نستطيع أن نبقى
بشر.

نحن
نرى بقلوبنا، وفي نفس الوقت نتجاهل تفاصيل

الأسلاك الشائكة.
لذلك،
قررنا أن نجمع 000،275

الحكمة

بدلاً من الأنا.
""عن

بدأنا
أن نجمع مبلغاً أكبر مما قصدنا إليه.

لن

لأن
ما نرى بقلوبنا هو:

Cuando
el hombre ve con su corazón

Hungría
es el país que se extiende en el centro de Europa, y según muchos
aquí late el Chacra del Corazón de la Tierra. De aquél planeta que
brinda hogar a toda la humanidad, pero a pesar de eso unos quitan el
hogar, la comida, la vida, la familia de los otros. Nosotros, los
húngaros, sabemos como es cuando nos quitan nuestro hogar, y un día
despertamos como extraños en nuestra tierra natal.

Y
a pesar de eso somos nosotros los que erigimos reja de alambre ante
el rostro de las personas aterradas. Somos nosotros los que de la
Barraca más Alegre nos convertimos en la mancha de deshonra de
Europa. Fuimos nosotros los que oficializamos el odio y la exclusión.

¡No,
no fuimos nosotros! Nosotros no nos identificamos con los que le dan
una patada a los que yacen en el suelo. Nosotros somos los que vemos
con el corazón, y no miramos con el rabo del ojo al mundo a través
de nuestro miedo. Nosotros somos los que sienten, comprenden el
peligro y la trampa, el cual está en acecho sobre nosotros y sobre
Europa, y a pesar de eso podemos seguir siendo Personas.

Vemos
con nuestro corazón, y nuestra atención pasa sobre tales detalles,
como que cuanto mide exactamente el día de hoy la valla de alambre.
Por eso es, que recolectamos 275.000 dólares en vez de 175.000. La
Sabiduría Universal nos enseñó, que a que conlleva cuando el
hombre ve con el corazón y no con su ego. ""Por casualidad""
empezamos a recaudar más de lo que fue nuestra intención original.
Esto tiene fuerza. No lo vamos a deshacer, y no lo vamos a
rectificar. Porque nosotros vemos con el corazón: lo esencial.
Para
275.000 metros de alambre de espino es 275.000 dólares de amor
nuestra respuesta.Wenn der Mensch mit seinem Herzen siehtUngarn ist jenes Land, welches in der Mitte Europas liegt und der Ort an dem vielen nach das Herzchakra unserer Erde schlägt. Das jenes Planeten, welcher das zu Hause aller Menschen ist, auf welchem dennoch der Eine das Zuhause, das Essen, das Leben oder gar die Familie des Anderen wegnimmt. Wir Ungarn wissen, was für ein Gefühl es ist, wenn man seiner Heimat beraubt wird und eines Tages als in unserer eigenen Heimat als Fremde aufwachen. Dennoch sind es gerade wir, die einen Stacheldrahtzaun vor den furchterflößten Gesichtern Anderer ziehen. Wir sind es, die aus der „muntersten Baracke“ zum Schandfleck Europas geworden sind. Wir sind diejenigen, welche Hass und Ausgrenzung für offiziell erklärt haben. Nein, das sind nicht wir, die so geworden sind! Wir sind nicht gleich jenen, welche die am Boden liegenden weiter treten. Wir sind jene, welche mit ihren Herzen sehen und nicht von hinter ihren Ängsten auf die Welt hinausschielen. Wir sind jene, die die Gefahr und Falle spüren und verstehen, welche auf uns und Europa lauert und dennoch menschlich bleiben können.Wir sind jene, welche mit ihren Herzen sehen und deren Aufmerksamkeit vorübergleitet daran wie lang der Stacheldrahtzaun am heutigen Tage gerade ist. Deshalb konnte es passieren, dass wir 275.000 Dollar gesammelt haben, anstelle der geplanten 175.000. Die universelle Weisheit hat gezeigt, was passiert, wenn der Mensch mit seinem Herzen sieht, und nicht nur mit seinem Ego. „Ausversehen“ haben wir mehr Spenden gesammelt, als wir es geplant hatten. Dies bedeutet Kraft. Wir wollen das nicht rückgängig machen und nicht korrigieren. Denn wir sehen mit unseren Herzen: das Wesentliche. Auf die 275.000 Meter Stacheldrahtzaun heißt unsere Antwort 275.000 Dollar voller Liebe.Quando la gente vede con il cuoreUngheria é il paese, che si estende in mezzo dell’Europa, e tanti lo credono che qui pulsa il chakra di cuore (anahataciakra) della Terra. Di quella pianeta, che dá una patria a tutta la gente, eppure uno toglie la casa, il cibo, la famiglia dell’altro. Noi ungheresi lo sappiamo, come é quando qualcuno toglie la nostra casa, ed un giorno svegliamo come stranieri nella nostra terra di nascita.Eppure siamo noi, che tiriamo un recinto di filo spinato davanti la faccia della gente terrorizzata. Siamo noi, che dalla „Baracca piú Allegra del Campo” siamo divenuti una macchia d’infama dell Europa. Siamo noi che avevamo ufficializzato l’odio e l’espulsione dei „differenti”.Ma no, non siamo noi! Noi non siamo identici con quelli che vorrebbero dare un calcio alla persona che si estende sulla terra. Noi siamo quelli che vedono con il cuore, non guardiamo il mondo attraverso il velo della nostra paura. Noi siamo quelli, che sentono il puzzo del pericolo e delle trappole, che ci circondano – eppure siamo capaci a rimanere Umani.Noi guardiamo con il cuore, e superiamo la domanda, quanti metri farebbe la lunghezza di quel recinto. Per questo é stato deciso di fare una colletta di 275 mila dollari invece di 175 mila.La Somma Sapienza Universale ci ha fatto vedere, com’é quando uno vede con il suo cuore e non con il suo Ego. „Per sbaglio” abbiamo iniziato a raccogliere di piú della nostra idea iniziale. Peró questa ha una forza. Non ci ritiriamo, e non facciamo neanche la correzione. Perché con il cuore noi vediamo: la sostanza.La nostra risposta ai 275 mila metri di fili spinati saranno 275 mila dollari di caritá.Quand on voit avec le cœurLa Hongrie est un pays situé au centre de l’Europe, et beaucoup pensent que c’est ici que le Chakra du cœur de la Terre palpite, cette Terre qui accueille tous les Hommes ; malgré cela, parfois un homme prend la  vie, la maison, la nourriture, la famille de l’autre. Nous les Hongrois, nous savons ce que signifie être privé de son habitation, de se réveiller un jour étranger dans sa propre patrie.Et ce sont quand-même nous ceux qui posons des fils de fer barbelés devant le visage de personnes apeurées. Sur la carte de l’Europe nous sommes passés de « la plus heureuse caserne » à la tâche déshonorante. Nous sommes ceux qui ont officialisé la haine et l’exclusion.Mais non ! Nous ne sommes pas ceux-là! Nous ne sommes pas comme ceux  qui donneraient un coup de pied à une personne couchée par terre. Nous sommes ceux qui voient avec le cœur et qui ne voient pas le monde uniquement à travers la peur. Nous sommes ceux qui sentent et comprennent le danger et la piège, auxquels nous sommes exposés, nous et l’Europe, mais sommes quand même capables rester Humains.  Nous voyons avec le cœur, et les détails tels que la longueur actuelle des fils de fer barbelés ne retiennent pas notre attention. C’est pour cela que nous collectons 275.000 dollars au lieu des 175.000 prévus. La sagesse universelle a montré où conduit quand on voit avec son cœur et non pas avec son ego. « Par hasard » nous avons commencé à collecter plus d’argent que prévu. Ce hasard a du pouvoir. Nous ne retirons pas, ne rectifions pas le montant. Car nous voyons avec le cœur : c’est là l’essentiel.Aux fils de fer barbelés d’une longueur de 275.000 mètres nous répondons par 275.000 dollars d’amour.Когда человек видит сердцемВенгрия - это страна, которая расположена в середине Европы, и где по мнению многих пульсирует Сердечная чакра Земли. То есть той Планеты, которая является общим домом для всех человечества, но всё равно одни люди отбирают у других жилище, еду, жизнь, семью. Мы, венгры, знаем, как это, когда нас лишают наших домов и наступает такой день, когда мы просыпаемся чужими на земле, на которой мы родились.Но опять же, это мы - те, кто натягивает колючую проволоку перед лицами перепуганных до смерти людей. Это мы - те, кто из «Самого весёлого барака» Европы стали её стыдом. Мы стали теми, кто официально декларировал ненависть и непринятие.Нет, такими стали не мы! Нас нельзя путать с теми, кто пинает ногой лежащих на земле. Мы те, кто видит сердцем, а не украдкой смотрит на мир, видя свои страхи. Мы те, кто чувствует и понимает опасности и ловушки, которые подстерегают нас и Европу, но всё равно смогли остаться Людьми.Мы видим сердцем, и из нашего внимания выпадают такие детали как сколько метров составляет точная длина ограды из колючей проволоки на сегодняшний день. Поэтому получилось так, что мы стали собирать 275 000 долларов вместо 175 000. Всеобщая Мудрость показала, к чему приводит, когда человек видит сердцем, а не своим эго. «Случайно» получилось так, что мы начали собирать больше, чем первоначально намеревались. У этого есть сила. Мы не повернём это вспять и не будет исправлять. Потому что своими сердцами мы видим суть.На 275 000 метров колючей проволоки наш ответ - 275 000 долларов любви

<p>William S. Burroughs has been a literary and cultural hero of
mine for 26 years. In 2010, I wrote an award winning one-man show called The
Burroughs and Kookie Show: Late Night in the Interzone. It was a wild adventure
into the absurd, surreal, and post modern world of Burroughs. During the 60
minute one-act play I was able to reveal the spirit and energy of my hero while
at the same time reveal some deeply painful and revelatory personal truths of
my own.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in 2015, I have decided to challenge myself to take my Burroughsian
journey to the next level. Over the next year I plan to travel to Europe,
Morocco, Mexico, South America, and throughout the US to literally walk in
William S. Burroughs footsteps. This August, I shall visit every city in Europe
that Burroughs lived in, ending my visit in Tangier, Morroco where he wrote his
most celebrated novel, Naked Lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Later, this year I shall travel to Mexico City to visit the location where Bill
accidentally shot and killed his wife, Joan Vollmer. Thus, catalyzing what
would become a lifetime of writing dedicated to ridding himself of what he
termed ""the Ugly Spirit"" that he firmly believed possessed and forced
him to commit his tragic mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Next January, I shall again visit New York City, Chicago, New Orleans, St.
Louis, and Lawrence, KS - to see his American stomping grounds.<br/>
<br/>
While traveling I will be working on a new two-act rock opera called, BURROUGHS 101: The Cold Dead Truth.<br/>
<br/>
This rock opera will dig deep into the life and times of William S. Burroughs,
deeper than ever before. I plan to reveal many unknown truths that very few
people know or remember about this iconic literary hero. He was so much more
than a junky, a wife killer, and literary revolutionary, and the Godfather of
Punk. He, like all of us, was a person with the same need for love and respect,
and with the same weaknesses that can lead a person away from their true path.</p>
<p>Your support during this 4 part campaign will help, during the 1st stage, pay for air travel, train travel, rental cars, hotels, motels,
coffees, cocktails, meals, and pens and paper-pens and paper-pens and papers
throughout my travels to Europe and Tangier. The 2nd stage, I shall travel and research
Mexico City and South America to unlock secrets regarding the accidental killing
of his wife, Joan Volmer, and his adventures in search of a cure to purge him
of the Ugly Spirt he believed possessed his body and drove him to commit the
tragic event – that would forever haunt him and his writing. The 3rd stage
will focus on my journey through the US to visit St. Louis – his birth place,
New York City – where he first met Allen Ginsberg and Jack Keruoac at Columbia
University, Chicago – where he worked as an exterminator,  New Orleans – where
he lived with his wife Joan, and then Rio Grande South Texas where he and
Joan lived with their two children and grew marijuana under the umbrella of
purporting to be corn farmers.  </p><p>Throughout my travels I shall post daily video reports as William S. Burroughs. Some special funders will have the reports delivered to them personally!<br/></p>
<br/><p>Ultimately, upon my return to San Francisco – I shall begin the

 Artistic Director, Valeria Yvette Gonzalez, found herself while 
exploring her passion for movement  and the unconscious mind. As a 
result this and her constant desire to make a difference in the world of
 dance, VALLETO was conceived in 2014. Many of her personal experiences 
and cultural encounters in the artistic world led her to create VALLETO 
as a dance company that also advocates for equality. As a Mexican dance 
artist, her vision is to raise a stronger voice for dance and the arts 
in countries where dance is not empowered the way it should be.<br/><p></p><p><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p><h3><i>VALLETO is now a platform that innovates dance, unifies the arts and advocates for equality.</i></h3><h3><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462479438/pita_43_lutonz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></h3><p><i><i>2016

 Artistic Director, Valeria Yvette Gonzalez, found herself while 
exploring her passion for movement  and the unconscious mind. As a 
result this and her constant desire to make a difference in the world of
 dance, VALLETO was conceived in 2014. Many of her personal experiences 
and cultural encounters in the artistic world led her to create VALLETO 
as a dance company that also advocates for equality. As a Mexican dance 
artist, her vision is to raise a stronger voice for dance and the arts 
in countries where dance is not empowered the way it should be.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VALLETO is now a platform that innovates dance, unifies the arts and advocates for equality.2016
 company dancers: Suzuka Matsumoto, Gabriela Rendon, Valeria Y. 
Gonzalez, Laura Bowers and Allison Metts. (Photo Credit: Melissa 
Gamache)VALLETO’s is a contemporary dance theater
company with roots of Gaga, Hip-hop and Ballet techniques. The performances
explore what the unconscious mind hides in the body. The process becomes a
playground for senses, imagination, stories and emotions explored through a magnified
glass.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VALLETO also narrates different topics in an abstract or humorous way to
reveal the relationship between body, the objective reality and the
unconscious mind in this new digital era.Our MISSION is
to create performances, initiatives, dance workshops and events
that leave a transformative experience. Our VISION is to inspire, impact, and
empower the artistic community all around the globe, and to create initiatives
that empower the global unheard voices in the current millennium.(""#VOIDS"" May 9th, 2015 at CPR / Photo Credit: Luis Nieto Dickens)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why an INDIEGOGO Campaign?VALLETO made its first company debut thanks to the amazing supporters who
 believed in us and donated through a crowdfunding platform back in 
2014. Thankfully, their support was able to take us even further than 
promised and we have accomplished so much! 
We premiered our first
season “Inner Dialogues” at The Kraine Theater in the East
Village with a FULL HOUSE.
We created 5 dance workshops with guest dance artists.
We performed in Washington Square Park.
We hosted a screening event for french artist JR called ""ELLIS"" and opened up a public conversation about Immigration. 
We created and performed our second season called
“#VOIDS” at the acclaimed theater ""Center for Performance Research"" in Brooklyn. 
We developed an improvisation, ballet and contemporary workshop in Cd. Juarez, Mexico. 
We introduced Gaga Technique in a workshop in Mexico.
We were selected to be part of the “Sublet Series” at HERE Arts in
SOHO where “Lesson Unlearned” made its debut successfully at the Dorothy B.
Williams Theater. 
We have created free events including our “Equality
First” conversations where the public is invited.
WANT TO SEE IT WITH YOUR OWN EYES?BELOW is a recapitulation:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THIS CAMPAIGN WAS CREATED TO MAKE OUR 3RD SEASON POSSIBLE IN ITS FINAL STAGE AND THE BEGINNING OF OUR 4TH SEASONSince
 our founding, it has been challenging to survive on a daily basis. 
Studio rentals and production costs are really expensive! Without a 
proper studio we can't rehearse and without specific production 
requests, our performances wouldn't be the same!Dance is an 
expensive enterprise that is not properly funded. But, with your support
 we can expand our vision in more communities!!
VALLETO aims to find new opportunities and more possibilities for dance theater. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUT .... WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO?

The funds earned from
this campaign will go specifically towards production costs such as: 

costume creation.
dancers fees

studio rentals (The most expensive!!)
theater rental

lighting designer
graphic designer
collaboration and performance taking place on September
video production

Valeria Yvette
González, Directora Artística de VALLETO, se encontró a sí misma cuando
descubrió su pasión por crear movimiento, la mente inconsciente y su gran deseo
de marcar una diferencia en el mundo de la danza, y como resultado fundó
VALLETO en 2014. Muchas de sus experiencias, y encuentros culturales en el
mundo artístico la llevo a crear VALLETO, una compañía de danza contemporánea
que también apoya y promueve la diversidad cultural en el mundo de la danza y
los derechos de igualdad en el mundo. Como bailarina mexicana, su visión es
empoderar la danza contemporánea y poder darle una voz fuerte al arte en países
donde el arte es visto como un “hobby.”


Fotografía:Melissa Gamache 
VALLETO es una compañía de danza contemporánea que emplea raíces de técnicas
como Gaga, Hip-hop y Ballet. Nuestros espectáculos representan emociones e
historias creadas desde una exploración profunda de lo que la mente
inconsciente esconde en el cuerpo. Durante el proceso de crear cada coreografía
exploramos, jugamos y observamos intensamente nuestra imaginación, nuestros
sentidos, nuestras historias y sobre todo emociones.


Fotografía: Melissa Gamache

VALLETO
también narra diferentes temas de forma abstracta o cómica, para así mismo
transmitir de diferentes formas la relación que hay entre un cuerpo, una
realidad objetiva y la mente inconsciente en esta nueva era digital. 
Nuestra MISIÓN es
crear espectáculos, iniciativas de empoderamiento, cursos de danza y eventos
que dejen una experiencia transformativa. Nuestra Visión es
inspirar, crear un impacto y empoderar la comunidad artística mundialmente, y
crear iniciativas donde apoyemos globalmente a voces que aún son ignoradas en
este milenio.

¿Y por qué una
campaña INDIEGOGO? 
VALLETO logró su debut
en el 2014 gracias al apoyo de gente que creyó en nuestra misión! Ahora podemos
decir y comprobar que hemos logrado mucho más de lo prometido!

VALLETO logró su debut
en el 2014 gracias al apoyo de gente que creyó en nuestra misión! Ahora podemos
decir y comprobar que hemos logrado mucho más de lo prometido! 


Estrenamos nuestra primera temporada con “Inner
     Dialogues” en el “Kraine Theater” en el “East Village” en Nueva York donde
     tuvimos casa llena.
Creamos 5 cursos de danza donde también invitamos a
     coreógrafos emergentes.
Nos presentamos en Washington Square Park.
Fuimos anfitriones de un evento creado por el artista
     francés JR y emitimos el cortometraje ""ELLIS"" donde también
     empezamos una conversación sobre migración.
Creamos y presentamos nuestra 2nda temporada llamada
     “#VOIDS” en el aclamado teatro “Center for Performance Research” en
     Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Creamos un taller de improvisación y danza
     contemporánea en Cd. Juárez, Chih. donde introducimos la técnica “Gaga.”
Fuimos seleccionados para ser parte del aclamado
     “Summer Sublet Series”  de el teatro “HERE” en SOHO Nueva York. Donde
     presentamos “Lesson Unlearned” por primera vez.
Hemos creado eventos incluyendo nuestras “Equality
     First” conversaciones donde el público puede participar y traer consigo
     algún tema pertinente a igualdad y diversidad.

¿QUIERES VERLO CON TUS PROPIOS OJOS? 
EN ESTE VIDEO puedes ver una
recapitulación de nuestras 3 temporadas:

Nuestra campaña
INDIEGOGO fue creada durante la última etapa creativa de nuestra 3era temporada
para lograr cubrir gastos en producción, así como también tener la posibilidad
de empezar a desenvolver el proceso creativo de la 4ta temporada.
Desde nuestro
establecimiento nos hemos enfrentado a diferentes retos monetarios. La renta de
estudios para ensayar y los gastos en producción son extremadamente costosos
para el presupuesto que manejamos como bailarines. Se necesita un estudio con
piso adecuado para no lastimarnos, así como también necesitamos tener los
accesorios específicos para poder crear un espectáculo profesional. Aunque muchos no lo
crean, las empresas de danza clasica y contemporanea son muy costosas y lamentablemente no son apoyadas
adecuadamente.

We want to grow so we can reach more people, which means CHANGING more people. The styles of dance &amp; events we host at the <i>""Kookies Dance Den""</i> increase smiles, self - esteem and builds people UP! It's NOT your avergae dance studio, just some hobby or a bucket-list spot. Over 3,000 reviews has proved this place is <strong>MANDATORY &amp; NEEDED. <i>Self- care is needed. It's not an option anymore.</i> </strong>Kookie's Dance Den has saved romantic relationships, built friendships, treated abuse victims, stopped suicides, and created more confident people! 8 counts here are MEDICINE, we teach people more than dance. There is NO places like this. Founded in 2012 this brand has continued to thrive, won awards and has been featured on several media and T.V outlets.  After the pandemic, we took a loss.

Hello! I'm Kookie Daniels 30 year old ""FOUNDER & ENTREPRENEUR""!
This campaign is to raise funding towards an EXPANSION of ""Kookie's Dance Den""
Good things need to exist. Kookie's Dance Den is a  ""GOOD THING"". Expanding this studio facility is going to CHANGE the dynamic of so many lives, not only in ILLINOIS but around the world (physically and virtually)! We want to grow so we can reach more people, which means CHANGING more people. The styles of dance & events we host at the ""Kookies Dance Den"" increase smiles, self - esteem and builds people UP! It's NOT your avergae dance studio, just some hobby or a bucket-list spot. Over 3,000 reviews has proved this place is MANDATORY & NEEDED. Self- care is needed. It's not an option anymore. Kookie's Dance Den has saved romantic relationships, built friendships, treated abuse victims, stopped suicides, and created more confident people! 8 counts here are MEDICINE, we teach people more than dance. There is NO places like this. Founded in 2012 this brand has continued to thrive, won awards and has been featured on several media and T.V outlets.  After the pandemic, we took a loss. However, we fought through it, and decided to go HARDER...because if we CLOSED, many people's ""ME TIME"" will stop. We often don't understand how important.. people feeling good about themselves truly is. Teaching people to do more, be more and give more is a life skill that changes the world. Kookie's Dance Den wants to continue changing the world. We are now accepting donations towards expanding so we can keep changing the world, one 8 count at a time!

<p>As actors, artists and sisters, we believe in lending ourselves to a higher cause through theater. We have dreamed of bringing David Auburn's play ""Proof"" to life not only because this play resonates with us on a deep level, it also brings to awareness the all-too-real struggles of families affected by cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's. </p>
<p>We are aiming for $4,000 towards our production (New York is pricey, y'all) for theater rental, props, lighting, rehearsal space, rights to the play, costumes, sets and programs. </p>
<p>Here's where it gets important: No matter what, we will donate at least 30% of tickets sales to the New York City Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association. HOWEVER, if we reach and/or surpass our goal of $4,000, we will donate 50% of ticket sales!</p>
<p>You can help us by sharing this campaign on social media and by telling your friends and family! </p>
<p>Theater is nothing more than tribes sitting around a campfire and reflecting humanity back to each other through stories. We long to be a part of this in a way that gives back to our human story. </p>

<h2>Who is SpiderWebShow? </h2>
<p>SpiderWebShow is a nationally-connected, Kingston-based performance company that creates and curates live, digital art. We are led by Artistic Director Michael Wheeler, Creative Catalyst Sarah Garton Stanley, and Festival Director Adrienne Wong (Directors, Creators, Adventurers all). We’ve worked with more than 200 makers from coast-to-coast-to-coast and we’re dedicated to using the unlimited capacity of digital technology to bolster the voices of diverse and disruptive artists across the country. We’ve hosted Thought Residencies, a magazine on Canadian arts and culture called CdnTimes, and even invented CdnStudio, an online performance tool that creates digital space for artists working across distance. And now, we’re bringing the internet together IRL.</p>

<h2>What the heck is foldA? </h2>
<p>foldA is our first move from curating to creating space for live, digital performance. This year we started thinking: how can we engage artists across the country to unpack the possibilities and fears associated with the digital shift? How can we use our coast-to-coast-to-coast digital networks to invite creators to be excited about the future of live performance?</p>
<p>foldA makes space for artists and thought leaders to investigate and experiment within the digital realm. Everything we are doing is with digital in mind. Our website, powered by PLANK, puts mobile access first. Our welcome package is powered by Slack (read about us on the Slack blog). Audience feedback forms are submitted directly from your phone to the artists themselves. We’re opting out of print programs for sustainability’s sake.</p>

We respectively ask you to help ""get the word out"" as our ambassadors and make some ""NOISE"" about our campaign on your own social media platforms. Strength in numbers can put us over the top and your recommendation may make that difference.
Remind your friends to pay it forward by sharing our campaign on their own social media platforms. You tell friends, they tell their friends and so on and so on!

<h3><i>WHO ARE WE?</i></h3>
<p>Located in San Francisco, CA, Left Coast Theatre Company, is a network of more than 100 LGBTQ and allied playwrights, directors, actors, and theater technicians passionate about creating and sharing the stories of the queer community through theater. We believe that the power of theater to tell the stories of the LGBTQ and allied community is vital to fostering understanding and acceptance in a time of change.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>WHAT ARE WE DOING?</i></h3>
<p>In the fall of 2019 we will producing Paul Rudnick’s <i>The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told</i>. This play tells the story of Adam and Eve, only it's Adam and Steve, who then meet Jane and Mable, and together the first two <i>homo</i>sexual couple in the world explore 2,000 years of human history from their perspective. While this is not a new play, it is stylistically innovative and definitely timely.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?</i></h3>
<p>San Francisco is a difficult city to produce indie theater - with rehearsal rentals, venue rentals, and production costs such as set materials, costumes and props skyrocketing daily.</p>
<p>Contributors will help us achieve the successful production of the show by relieving the burden of rehearsal, venue, and administrative costs and allowing us to focus on production and artist costs. This show is more complex than any of our previous shows, with more intricate costumes, sets, and props than we have built in the past. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>WHAT DO WE NEED HELP WITH?</i></h3>
<p>In order for Left Coast to produce this show successfully we need some assistance in relieving some housekeeping costs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Venue rental costs: $2,500</li>
<li>Rehearsal rentals costs: $1,500</li>
<li>Administration costs (insurance, printing, marketing materials, etc.): $2,000</li>
</ol>
<p>By contributing to these overhead costs we will be able to focus revenue funds on our production materials (costumes, props, set pieces, etc.) and our creative staff (actors, directors) and crew staff (stage managers, tech designers, etc.). Left Coast is a fully volunteer organization, with the ability to offer our incredible artists a stipend, but we always want to offer them more! For their dedication and hard work on this show we are hoping to be able to do that.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>WHY IS THE SHOW IMPORTANT TO PRODUCE?</i></h3>
<p>We believe this play specifically will have a unifying impact on our audience and community. Producing <i>Fabulous Story</i> in November 2019 ensures its themes dovetail with election season conversations as we gather for the holidays with deeply held (and often divergent) viewpoints. <i>Fabulous Story</i> queers the notion of Christmas as an American institution built on the traditional, nuclear family, demonstrating how truly Christmas can be for every family—and by extension manifesting the necessity for each of us to have trusted “families” (whether related by blood, world view, or just plain love) to keep us strong through life’s toughest trials and share the blessings of life’s greatest joys. </p>
<p>It's important to remind the San Francisco Bay Area that we can still love and accept our religious siblings and friends, even if we don’t see eye-to-eye, especially around the holidays. We hope this production will unite our community to shore it up for the stress of 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>""Petrified Lightning"" tells the story of a happenstance seaside meeting, which forces two strangers into a tumultuous exploration of fear and loss. Together they must decide to experience the unknown or forever be petrified by it.</p>
<p>A note from the playwright: I wrote ""Petrified Lightning"" a year after my mother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  I wanted to explore my seemingly innate inability to share my grief and fear with the people closest to me. After my mother passed away in August 2019, I began revising the piece. ""Petrified Lightning"" will be premiering at the Strawberry One-Act Festival in February 2020. I am fortunate to have Jacob S. Louchheim directing and starring as Thaddeus, while I will be portraying Susanna.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $2,500 to help defray the costs associated with participation in the festival</p>
<p>Rehearsal Space: $600 will be spent on booking space for 31 hours of rehearsal at Shetler Studios</p>
<p>Actors: $1,380. We think it's important to pay your artists--even if that means paying yourself! We will be working for New York City minimum wage, which is $15 per hour. The $690 per actor includes rehearsal, tech rehearsals, and all performances during the festival.</p>
<p>Sound and Lighting Technician: $200 will be used to pay our sound and light technician, who is responsible for designing and running our sound and lighting for the show.</p>
<p>Costumes and set: $120</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: $200. Things happen and we think it's important to have a little wiggle room for when the tide comes in!</p>
<p>Any additional money raised will be used as reimbursement for the $400 festival fee, as well as any future productions of ""Petrified Lightning.""</p>
<p><strong>About the Festival</strong></p>
<p>The Strawberry One-Act Festival is a play competition in which the audience and the theatre's judges cast their votes to select the best play of the season.  Twice a year, hundreds of plays from across the country are submitted for the competition.  Plays move from the 1st Round to the Finals. The finals are judged by a theatre producer, literary agent, acting agent, and a casting director. The playwright of the winning play receives $1,500 and the opportunity to have a full-length play developed by the Riant.  The awards to be presented are Best Play, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Costume Design, Best Set Design, and Best Video Diary Short Film.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We would love to see everyone at the show! ""Petrified Lightning"" will be performed on February 12th at 8:30 pm and February 13th at 6 pm. Tickets can be purchased online for $25 or in-person at the box office for $27. Tickets can be purchased at the link below:</p>

Though this project takes inspiration from an Ancient Greek myth, its exploration of how the oppressed soul reclaims its strength amidst unthinkable brutality is palpably relevant. While we want to provoke with questions regarding violence, misogyny, grief, corruption and revenge, we ultimately seek to transcend the torment of Hecuba’s pain and ignite a communal catharsis for artists and audience alike.</p><h3>WHO WE ARE</h3><p><i>Cynosemma</i> is a joint project between Los Angeles based Overtone Industries and theatre company By The Souls of Our Feet (BTSOOF). The members of BTSOOF (Megan Breen, Kristin Condon, Nathan Singh and Sabina Zuniga Varela) all attended USC’s School for Dramatic Arts.  After the invigorating catharsis and connection of their inaugural production in 2013 - Serpentine Pink - ,  they formed a collective hell-bent on creating visceral and poetic theatre experiences. Overtone Industries began 40 years ago by Artistic Director O-Lan Jones as a way to develop and present new multidisciplinary operas and music theatre, bringing to life vivid, original stories and myths. The shared mission of these two groups made it an obvious choice for collaboration, and the beginnings of Cynosemma were born.</p><h3>PROJECT HISTORY</h3><p>We have been developing this show since 2017, starting with informal workshops. The first portion of the show, stations 1-3, were presented in 2018 for five sold-out nights at the Son of Semele Theater. The workshop performance received beautiful reviews from both <a href=""http://stageraw.com/2018/08/23/cynosemma-a-dirge-from-the-dogs-tomb-theater-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STAGE RAW</a> and the <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-cynosemma-moon-walk-notebook-20180821-story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LA TIMES</a>. Now we are asking you to help support the ultimate phase of development and the premiere performance, scheduled for the summer of 2020.</p><h3>WHY THIS PROJECT</h3><p>This primitive opera, with a grieving but resilient and raw female protagonist, tackles difficult questions concerning society’s gender norms, allowing the artists and communities who engage with it to reconsider any limited attitudes towards women and their roles in the spiritual, social, and political arenas; to tell stories in which the female protagonists are strong, complex and act upon their agency in a powerful way, reflecting and celebrating the progress we have made in 2019 regarding gender issues and women’s rights, as well as stirring us to keep moving forward.</p><h3>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING</h3><p>Your donations will help us secure rehearsal space, provide supplies for costumes and props, and most importantly, pay a decent wage to our eight excellent performers and creative artists as they commit their time and energy to bringing this revelatory work to life. Only about 25% of the opera’s cost will come from ticket sales, and only another 25% percent will come from grants. We are relying on our community of theater lovers, people who believe in the transformative power of the stage, to make this show happen.</p><p>You can be a vital part of bringing this important retelling and reclaiming of the Hecuba myth into today’s world. In a time when there is so much devastation in the world, artists, audiences and supporters can collect in the sacredness of the theatrical space and reclaim Hecuba’s story of devastation to release the pain, fear and anxiety that oppressors inflict upon us, setting us on a path towards healing. Through the enacting and witnessing of ritual theatre in a sacred space that aims to heal, we can come together in a communally spiritual way to replenish any spiritual drought.</p><p>We are offering our donors some fun and imaginative perks for their support, including ways to attend the performances, take pieces of the show home with you, and even commission brand new works of art.</p><p>Donations of any amount make a pivotal difference!

<p><strong>On Site</strong> is a one act comedy about the life of Derek Setliff, the gay Michael Scott version of a property manager. On Site was originally a 13 minute comedic mockumentary pilot I wrote and produced, and from that, I developed a 30 minute one-act play which will make its premier this summer at <strong>FRINGE FEST</strong>!!!!</p>
<p>In reality, Derek is a heightened version of myself. Like Derek, I am a property manager. Oh, and also I came out of the closet later in life. In my writing, I want to explore what it feels like to be yourself and question if others will accept that true version of you. One challenge many gay men experience, myself included, is that feeling of stunted emotional growth. While many people start exploring dating and their sexuality closer to puberty, people in the closet are deprived of that exploration in an open way until they come out. It’s important to me to produce a show about a 30-something gay male trying to both be himself and also find a genuine connection with others.</p>
<p>As it turns out, producing a play is challenging, y’all, and because I care more about getting butts in seats than I do about making money, I have 2 questions to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How many discounted tickets can I give away?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How many free tickets can I give away?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to answer those questions, I gotta take a look at my <strong>budget</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hollywood Fringe Registration: $300</li>
<li>The Space: $1,037<ul>
<li>5 performance slots</li>
<li>2 hours of tech time</li>
<li>1 tech person</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Publicity: $500<ul>
<li>Programs</li>
<li>Posters</li>
<li>Postcards</li>
<li>Finge Festival Ads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Misc: $300<ul>
<li>Food for actors</li>
<li>Props / Set pieces</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: $1,837</strong></p>
<p>Technically, I need to sell 154 full price tickets to break even. This means as of today, I can give away discounted or free tickets to 6 people. That’s not so great, and that’s ONLY if we sell the rest of the seats at full price. This is a lot of pressure, and again I care more about getting butts in seats than I do about money. So, this is where you come in:</p>
<p>With your help, my <strong>goal</strong> is to raise <strong>$1,500 </strong>to help offset these numbers. If you help me bring in $1,500, then I only need to sell 29 full price seats in order to break even. That means I can give free or discounted tickets to up to 104 people! That makes it that much more likely that we will, in fact, sell out.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s where you come in.</strong> If you donate $25, I will send you a code for 1 ticket to see On Site! If you donate $50, you will get a code for 2 tickets, and so on, and so on. Not only does your money get you the opportunity to see the premier of On Site, but it also helps us . . . wait for it . . . GET MORE BUTTS IN SEATS!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your support. I love you!</strong></p>

In reality, Derek is a heightened version of myself. Like Derek, I am a property manager. Oh, and also I came out of the closet later in life. In my writing, I want to explore what it feels like to be yourself and question if others will accept that true version of you. One challenge many gay men experience, myself included, is that feeling of stunted emotional growth. While many people start exploring dating and their sexuality closer to puberty, people in the closet are deprived of that exploration in an open way until they come out. It’s important to me to produce a show about a 30-something gay male trying to both be himself and also find a genuine connection with others.
As it turns out, producing a play is challenging, y’all, and because I care more about getting butts in seats than I do about making money, I have 2 questions to answer:

How many discounted tickets can I give away?
How many free tickets can I give away?

In order to answer those questions, I gotta take a look at my budget:

Hollywood Fringe Registration: $300
The Space: $1,037
5 performance slots
2 hours of tech time
1 tech person
Insurance


Publicity: $500
Programs
Posters
Postcards
Finge Festival Ads


Misc: $300
Food for actors
Props / Set pieces



Total: $1,837
Technically, I need to sell 154 full price tickets to break even. This means as of today, I can give away discounted or free tickets to 6 people. That’s not so great, and that’s ONLY if we sell the rest of the seats at full price. This is a lot of pressure, and again I care more about getting butts in seats than I do about money. So, this is where you come in:
With your help, my goal is to raise $1,500 to help offset these numbers. If you help me bring in $1,500, then I only need to sell 29 full price seats in order to break even. That means I can give free or discounted tickets to up to 104 people! That makes it that much more likely that we will, in fact, sell out.
Here’s where you come in. If you donate $25, I will send you a code for 1 ticket to see On Site! If you donate $50, you will get a code for 2 tickets, and so on, and so on. Not only does your money get you the opportunity to see the premier of On Site, but it also helps us . . . wait for it . . . GET MORE BUTTS IN SEATS!
Thank you for your support. I love you!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

The production then took New York by storm, being described by the <i>New York Times</i> as:  “truly fearsome or really ridiculous…  oh, so deliciously, both… the silliest and the most sinister show in town. It is also… one of the smartest… <b>Few shows have ever been as good at being bad</b>… It gets under your skin and stays there.”  To get a taste of the original production by the Tiger Lillies et al., please check out YouTube:  </span></p>

Maybe by cultivating some dark appetites of your own…Written & directed by Julia Jarcho with live sound design by Ben Williams, minor theater’s The Terrifying premieres at Abrons Arts Center March 12-April 2, 2017. Starring Jess Barbagallo, Kim Gainer, Kristine Haruna Lee, Hanna Novak, and Pete Simpson; with sets by Jason Simms, costumes by Ásta Bennie Hostetter, and lights by Barbara Samuels; producer John Del Gaudio; associate producer Gillian Fallon; production manager Ann Marie Dorr; stage manager Liz Nielsen; production assistant Stephen Smith.Who are we?minor theater is a NYC company putting on plays written and directed by Julia Jarcho. The artists are downtown veterans including Jenny Seastone (NY Innovative Theatre Award, 2014), Ben Williams (Elevator Repair Service; OBIE 2012), and costume designer Ásta Bennie Hostetter (OBIE 2016). With dark humor and goofball precision, we camp out on the underbelly of pop culture. We tell the stories that don’t fit into the stories. We are champions of weird desire. We’ve been working together for a long time but we just started the company a couple of years ago and The Terrifying will be the first piece to premiere as a minor theater show.And hey. There’s a lot of things that need your help right now, and we know downtown theater might not be at the top of the list. That totally makes sense. But if it does feel like an important time to support weird art—and those spaces of experiment where we can try to make something that feels really right, for once—we hope you’ll consider contributing. Either way, we hope you’ll come check out the show.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About The Project</h3>
<p>My name is Thalia Gonzalez Kane and I am a queer, Ecuadorian-Canadian artist based in Toronto.</p>
<p>The '94 Club is my playwriting debut and the inaugural production of Crave Productions. </p>
<p>Based on true events, <i>THE ’94 CLUB</i> explores gender politics, sexuality, coming of age, queerness and the harsh realities of of growing up in a small town. As our society grows into one of openness and understanding, it is important we hear these stories of oppression and pain. It is important we acknowledge our past and work to amend the future. Without self-reflection, we will not be able to better ourselves and our world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting on a new play is not easy, nor is it cheap. We need to cover space rental, rehearsal space, insurance, supplies, advertising etc.... but most importantly- The artists. We are proud to be paying every single artist involved Equity rates and that takes up the majority of our budget. This is a new play being produced by an indie theatre company. It would be easy to do the show under a profit-share model, it happens all the time. However, we have an unbelievable team of women assembled to put on this show and it was vital in planning that everyone be paid. Our budget is higher than the usual indie theatre production, but we feel good knowing our artists will have some means to continue to live their lives.</p>

I have a BA in Theater Arts from Loyola Marymount University. I’ve been working in front of and behind the camera for the past few years but I’m about to get back to my roots in the theater.  </p><p>I’m really excited to be teaming with Kelly Shea and her non-profit <a href=""http://www.thecollectivestudiola.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Collective Studio: Los Angeles</a> to bring both Reasons To Be Pretty and Reasons To Be Happy to life this fall. We also have actor/director extraordinaire <a href=""https://jeffreymeek.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Meek</a> to helm the ship as the director. You may know Jeff from his work on the silver screen over the years. He is also the Artistic Director of PlayFest Santa Barbara.</p><p>There are so many amazing artists that don’t get to spread their wings in the theater in Los Angeles, and we will be very lucky to employ a handful of talented and dedicated people.

I have a BA in Theater Arts from Loyola Marymount University. I’ve been working in front of and behind the camera for the past few years but I’m about to get back to my roots in the theater.  I’m really excited to be teaming with Kelly Shea and her non-profit The Collective Studio: Los Angeles to bring both Reasons To Be Pretty and Reasons To Be Happy to life this fall. We also have actor/director extraordinaire Jeffrey Meek to helm the ship as the director. You may know Jeff from his work on the silver screen over the years. He is also the Artistic Director of PlayFest Santa Barbara.There are so many amazing artists that don’t get to spread their wings in the theater in Los Angeles, and we will be very lucky to employ a handful of talented and dedicated people. For the community, putting on a play is like starting a conversation. This conversation to me is about beauty, attraction, love, self-discovery, growing up, and communication, or lack there of. Our project is unique because we will be doing a play and its sequel in two consecutive weekends – giving the audience a chance to catch up or refresh their memory of Neil LaBute’s great works before his third play in the series premieres.As a contributor you can be proud of creating jobs for artists and helping us develop characters the audience can relate to in a therapeutic way. Our Production Will Gave Back to the CommunityWe are all very passionate about giving back.

<p>Join Prism Movement Theater as they adapt one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, all without a single word. LEAR is a beautiful and moving work of dance theater that focuses on the relationship between Lear and her daughters. <br/><br/>When Lear is betrayed by her corrupt daughters, Regan and Goneril, her sanity is sent into a tailspin, forcing her only faithful daughter, Cordelia, to take up the mantle and fight for her mother's dignity and the fate of the kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>O BRAVE NEW WORLD!</strong></p>
<p>This fall, Prism Movement Theater has been given the incredible opportunity to perform in Theater Three's basement space, Theater Too.  That means you have the opportunity to help fund this incredible work of art that will be performing in the heart of uptown under the umbrella of an award-winning theater like Theater Three.  This collaboration is an amazing opportunity for us but we need your help to pull it off! </p>
<p>Written by Prism Movement Theater cofounder, Katy Tye, (the writer behind incredible shows like Persephone and MIDAS) This production of LEAR will heavily feature dance, clowning, live music, and sword fights, all to subvert and reinvent the classical Lear narrative into something for the modern age.</p>
<p>By doing wordless Shakespeare, we are diving right into the core of the emotional life in Shakespeare’s work.  From the minute the audience walks downstairs into that basement theater, we want them to feel as if they are descending into Shakespeare’s world and eventually Lear’s madness.</p>
<p>The audience will walk into Lear’s retirement party, where they will meet Regan, Goneril, the Fool, Cordelia, and even Lear herself. After the party goes horribly wrong, Lear struggles to maintain her sanity, and pulls the audience down with her on her slide into madness.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Laura Watkins (music and lyrics) and Nicholas David Brandt (book), the creators of ""Comic-Con The Musical."" Along with our producer/original cast member Jessica Gardner, we are so excited to finally bring our new musical to the stage.</p>

<p>- Rehearsal and tech space</p>
<p>- Playbills and printing</p>
<p>- Costume rental/purchases (especially for our awesome ""Masquerade"" ball number!)</p>

The man himself is revealed in his words and actions as he confronts the difficulties posed by women, minorities, construction deadlines, and Louis Sullivan.BURNHAM'S DREAM: THE WHITE CITY has been officially endorsed by Illinois Bicentennial and is live on our website here: https://illinois200.com/celebrate/events/ About UsWriter and producer JUNE FINFER is president of Lost and Found Productions.   Her play about Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House, The Glass House, premiered in New York City in 2010.  Developmental presentations of Burnham’s Dream: The White City were  presented in Chicago venues to enthusiastic capacity audiences at IIT, Glessner House, Athenaeum Theater, Pleasant Home, Swedenborg Library at the  Chicago Temple,  CliffDwellers, and Heitman Architects.   https://lostandfoundproductions.org/Award-winning ASCAP member  ELIZABETH DOYLE  is the composer and co-lyricist of Burnham’s Dream.   She has worked with June Finfer to develop the musical over several years of concert performances.  Doyle’s solo cabaret and jazz programs have wowed live and broadcast audiences and she has composed music for many musicals produced in the Midwest and California, including  Fat Tuesday, The Virginian, and Sleepy Hollow.  www.elizabethdoylemusic.com Lost and Found Productions, founded by June Finfer in 1993, has produced award-winning films about art and architecture that are in international distribution,  including The Farnsworth House, Mies van der Rohe’s Czech Masterpiece: Tugendhat House, Creating Community: Lafayette Park, and the Chicago Parks of Alfred Caldwell.   Finfer’s interest in architecture and urban planning was a result of her marriage to the late architect and city and regional planner Paul Finfer, designer of the New Town of Valdez, Alaska,  after the Good Friday Earthquake.  He was always aware of the impact of  their physical setting on the daily lives of people --  access to open spaces,  safe transportation routes, accommodation to nature’s imperatives.  Fascinated by the vision and idealism of her husband, and the challenges he faced in dealing with the political and economic pressures on any planning project, June Finfer explored in films and plays the lives and accomplishments of visionaries such as Mies van der Rohe, John Root, Louis Sullivan,  and Daniel Burnham. Testimonial From A Concert Performance""The White City Musical - - With the combination of history, humor and excellent musical performances, the show appealed to a wide audience including seniors, young adults, music aficionados and architecture buffs.  Guests particularly enjoyed the representation of Daniel Burnham and Louis Sullivan, and music numbers such as ""Never Marry an Architect"" and ""Are You In"" were crowd favorites. If The White City Musical were to become a full production, there will already be a solid fan base who will jump at the chance to experience it again."" Heidi Ruehle-May, Execotive Director, Pleasant Home, Oak Park, IlReview of The Glass House production in NYC Fascinating.  It’s a great approach to illuminating and humanizing the lives of people we have come to regard, wrongly, as icons rather than people. Jon Camea, Director , The Working Group, NY *All contributions are tax-deductible to the extent allowed by law.  Follow us on Facebookhttps://www.facebook.com/TheWhiteCityAMusical/https://whitecitymusical.org/",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help! Although we were accepted to the festival, the cost of getting the collective to Malaysia, and staging a full-scale production requires funds. Patrons of art will not want to miss this opportunity to be at the ground stage of this revolutionary project.</p>
<p>Our current goal of $4,000 will go toward the price of producing a show at the George Town Festival. Our budget includes sound equipment, light equipment, set costs, and travel costs. This is our largest show to date, and anything you give will help.</p>

WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES
Funds raised through our
Indiegogo campaign will help fund the modest costs of our first run and allow
us to provide a small stipend to the cast, musicians and director of $250 per
person. We do no receive any ticket proceeds. We estimate over 700 person hours of rehearsal will have been completed
by opening night. The writers are not seeking any compensation.  If we raise more than our budget, additional funds will go to increase the stipends. Our budget of
$3,695 we plan to raise includes:
·  Marketing and
promotion (postcards, social media, logo, programs, etc)  - $450
·  Costumes and props -
$320
·  Snacks for rehearsals
(our cast are hungry beasts!) - $175
·  Stipend for actors,
musicians and the director ($250 per person) - 
$2,750

</div></div>","About MDC Menagerie Dance Collective is an aspiring dance company and movement project that currently does not exist for the dancer. Dancers pursue personal artistry as a soloist while also performing with the group or collective.  This approach provides the dancer with rich personal and shared experiences that otherwise do not exist. Please help us share this opportunity.
From our audience: ""Spending time with ""Menagerie"" touches the observer, moves one to tears, and awakens a deeper sense of human connection. That sense of community, that sense of belonging, even if fleeting; is a welcomed experience"".

Workshop the musical with actors and musicians for at least two months


Incorporate projections, puppetry and other forms of media into the workshop production as much as possible, as these elements are both exciting to work with and also essential to creating the play world. 


Perform a semi staged reading of ""The Demon Wars"" at the end of the semester (around the end of April, exact date TBD)


Produce an original cast recording of all the music in the show. 

Prepare the whole production for competition, post-graduation performances, etc. 
What do we need money for exactly? 

Projectors
Props
Lights
Puppetry equipment
Costumes
Set pieces
General Supplies
Recording costs

Set in a present day Bible-Belt village in the Netherlands, people go about their everyday lives wearing a mask for the world and themselves. Their façades start to fall apart when the Duke decides to leave and give the authority over to the seemingly stern Angelo.</p><p>Merchant Of Venice:</p><p>What does it cost to fit in? To stand out?</p><p>Our version of Merchant of Venice will examine society's darker impulses. Set in the same Dutch Bible-Belt village, we explore the nastier side of one of Shakespeare's most famous plays and ask the question: what does blind faith really get you?</p><p> </p><p>Who Are We?</p><p>Our company is made up of actors, directors, and writers from all over the world (we have had people from Canada, the Netherlands, the USA, Eastern Europe, and of course the UK). We have all trained or worked in the theatre for years and have learned varying techniques (The Method (Strasberg), Grotowski, Stanislavski, Hall, Viewpoints, among many others). It is the combination of these techniques and the artists that use them that produces the best work and we firmly believe that each artist's experience and training informs us as a whole.</p><p>Here are a couple of specifics:</p><p></p><p>Rachael Bellis (the Artistic Director, Co-Director Merchant of Venice): Rachael trained as an actor at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in New York, studying Strasberg's Method for three years. Upon moving to London, she immersed herself in Shakespeare and learned the technique practiced by Sir Peter Hall, working as a student on a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Rose Theatre Kingson in 2010. Rachael strongly believes in combining these techniques so that Hall's approach to text and Strasberg's approach to character work together harmoniously.</p><p>Sophia Start (Director Measure for Measure, Co-Director Merchant of Venice): Sophia has been immersed in the world of Shakespeare for much of her adult life, having studied the plays in depth at both UCL and Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She also has been a student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, studying an evening course Directing. Sophia has assistant directed several productions on the fringe circuit and looks forward to putting that experience to work with the team at Aequitas!</p><p>Remaining Cast:</p><p>Rosie Aylward</p><p>Mark Desmond</p><p>Zoe Evans</p><p>Tara Godolphin</p><p>Rebecca Lund</p><p>Meg Matthews</p><p> </p><p>The show will be performed March 24-29, 2015 at the Bread &amp; Roses Theatre in Clapham, an incredible new theatre space with the same desire to ensure that those who work on the fringe get proper pay. Check them out at <a href=""http://www.breadandrosestheatre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.breadandrosestheatre.co.uk</a></p><p></p><p>All money raised here will be going towards cast and crew wages. Other production costs have a budget elsewhere and are already covered. This includes the cost of Indiegogo perks, which are being funded by our artistic director, Rachael Bellis. This campaign is really all about wages for our actors and crew who really deserve to be able to earn a living from all their hard work.</p><p></p><p>Be A Patron Of The Arts</p><p>We want to put on two of the most classic of plays in one of the most classic performance styles (repertory) in what we think is the classiest city in the world. It's super important that even with budget cuts in arts funding worldwide, we continue to support and recognize the arts, whether that is in budding theatre companies like ours or elsewhere (though obviously we want you to support us...that's why we are crowdfunding).</p><p> </p><p>Our project is valuable to the world because we want to show our community that we can put on performances and pay people fairly--and that message extends not only to theatre companies, but also to other companies across the world.</p><p>Our project is valuable to you (yes you!) because you will be helping people who normally work a second job to pay for their first job (aka theatre makers) to focus entirely on creating their art--which will make the work better. There is a long tradition in the arts of patrons supporting artists and if you support us, we will consider you our patron. Think about going to work and telling your colleagues you are a patron of the arts. How prestigious does that sound? (We like the sound of that too.)</p><p>We successfully put on Black Sunday, our last production in the Camden Fringe, a couple of years ago. It was successful as fringe productions go, but the profits did not make enough to pay for more than the cast and crew to celebrate at the end of the run. We want to take it further this time and ensure that a fair wage is paid to everyone. We are repeating this a lot, we know. It's because it's really important.</p><p> </p><p>What If You Can't Contribute?</p><p>If you can't afford to contribute, don't worry, you can still help us!</p><p>You can share our link or our video. You can like us on Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/AequitasTheatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/AequitasTheatre</a>) and follow us on Twitter (@AequitasTheatre). You can share our posts. You can make noise about our campaign.</p><p>Hopefully our campaign strikes a chord with you. If it does, please donate and share so that anyone you know who you think will be able to help can do so.

Their façades start to fall apart when the Duke decides to leave and give the authority over to the seemingly stern Angelo.Merchant Of Venice:What does it cost to fit in? To stand out?Our version of Merchant of Venice will examine society's darker impulses. Set in the same Dutch Bible-Belt village, we explore the nastier side of one of Shakespeare's most famous plays and ask the question: what does blind faith really get you? Who Are We?Our company is made up of actors, directors, and writers from all over the world (we have had people from Canada, the Netherlands, the USA, Eastern Europe, and of course the UK). We have all trained or worked in the theatre for years and have learned varying techniques (The Method (Strasberg), Grotowski, Stanislavski, Hall, Viewpoints, among many others). It is the combination of these techniques and the artists that use them that produces the best work and we firmly believe that each artist's experience and training informs us as a whole.Here are a couple of specifics:Rachael Bellis (the Artistic Director, Co-Director Merchant of Venice): Rachael trained as an actor at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in New York, studying Strasberg's Method for three years. Upon moving to London, she immersed herself in Shakespeare and learned the technique practiced by Sir Peter Hall, working as a student on a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Rose Theatre Kingson in 2010. Rachael strongly believes in combining these techniques so that Hall's approach to text and Strasberg's approach to character work together harmoniously.Sophia Start (Director Measure for Measure, Co-Director Merchant of Venice): Sophia has been immersed in the world of Shakespeare for much of her adult life, having studied the plays in depth at both UCL and Utrecht University in the Netherlands. She also has been a student at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, studying an evening course Directing. Sophia has assistant directed several productions on the fringe circuit and looks forward to putting that experience to work with the team at Aequitas!Remaining Cast:Rosie AylwardMark DesmondZoe EvansTara GodolphinRebecca LundMeg Matthews The show will be performed March 24-29, 2015 at the Bread & Roses Theatre in Clapham, an incredible new theatre space with the same desire to ensure that those who work on the fringe get proper pay. Check them out at www.breadandrosestheatre.co.ukAll money raised here will be going towards cast and crew wages. Other production costs have a budget elsewhere and are already covered. This includes the cost of Indiegogo perks, which are being funded by our artistic director, Rachael Bellis. This campaign is really all about wages for our actors and crew who really deserve to be able to earn a living from all their hard work.Be A Patron Of The ArtsWe want to put on two of the most classic of plays in one of the most classic performance styles (repertory) in what we think is the classiest city in the world. It's super important that even with budget cuts in arts funding worldwide, we continue to support and recognize the arts, whether that is in budding theatre companies like ours or elsewhere (though obviously we want you to support us...that's why we are crowdfunding). Our project is valuable to the world because we want to show our community that we can put on performances and pay people fairly--and that message extends not only to theatre companies, but also to other companies across the world.Our project is valuable to you (yes you!) because you will be helping people who normally work a second job to pay for their first job (aka theatre makers) to focus entirely on creating their art--which will make the work better. There is a long tradition in the arts of patrons supporting artists and if you support us, we will consider you our patron. Think about going to work and telling your colleagues you are a patron of the arts. How prestigious does that sound? (We like the sound of that too.)We successfully put on Black Sunday, our last production in the Camden Fringe, a couple of years ago. It was successful as fringe productions go, but the profits did not make enough to pay for more than the cast and crew to celebrate at the end of the run. We want to take it further this time and ensure that a fair wage is paid to everyone. We are repeating this a lot, we know. It's because it's really important.

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Patrick-Jude Oteh and I am the Artistic Director of the Jos Repertory Theatre. We use the theatre to challenge crucial issues that affect our daily existence. 
The highlight of my career happened in 2009 - 2011 when I was fortunate to spend three summers at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington DC. I left the program learning how to use the arts to produce change.
Our current campaign is critical to us as we are confronted with dire situations that defy all economic indices but I believe very firmly that the arts can help point our legion of unemployed youths and even in-school youths in the right direction towards making life changing career judgements.
Every single contribution will help in making this reality possible using the arts of the theatre. Poverty is a daily grind we believe we can use the arts to challenge and possibly change.

  What We Need & What You Get We are requesting for USD $25,000 as our total funds to enable us create undocumented stories from very ordinary lives which are being lived under very daunting and extra-ordinary circumstances. Most of these stories are very brave and universal.
BUDGET:
Design USD $3,500
Overheads including expansion of our current space USD $8,000
Publicity towards the 10th Jos Festival of Theatre 2017 USD $3,500
Artistes Fees / Honorarium USD $10,000
TOTAL USD $25,000
If we do not reach our entire goal, we will scale down the scope of our project or make another appeal through local philanthropists to make up for the difference.

  The Impact
Our project is very valuable and will make the much needed difference in our immediate community. Currently, there are over 15 million young people with no access to a hope filled  and bright future. We believe that the theatre can make a difference.
There are about 10 million young people that are out of school in the region where we work. We believe that the arts can make a difference in their situation.
There are over 7 million in-school youths who have not been able to make a decision on which life changing career they will want to go into. We believe that the theatre can help them to make a decision.
Your contribution will make this possible!

  Risks & Challenges
We have been in existence for 17 years and we are still energized to be around for a long time to come. Our ability to be resilient has been of immense value in our situation and the life changing benefits of the arts and the theatre specifically will continue to enable us to make a difference in the immediate future. 
The challenges are numerous but they are not insurmountable. We have the will, and we have the ability and our young people have the energy but they need a platform. The stage and the theatre can provide this platform.

<p>‘Daddy was a Boogie Man’ is a play about a dysfunctional relationship between a mother and her daughter and the outside world. Set in 1970’s Dublin, in a tenement block, Mammy and her seventeen year old daughter, Eadaoin live together in a cramped and filthy room.  This show will employ physical theatre and at the same time be heavily reliant on the strong dialogue and powerful words. It is moving and emotional because of the tragic situation; their relationship is based on love, no matter how dysfunctional. It is also very much a feminist play with strong female characters questioning what it means to be a woman and what one’s role is in a social and religious context.</p>
<p>We are needing to fundraise to get 12 cast and crew to Galway Fringe between July 11th and 16th, as well as funding for our props and set.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are Erin's Fiddle, from Belgrade, Serbia, the biggest Irish dance school and troupe in our region. During the 10 years of existence we have overcome many problems and managed to stay together and become what we are today. Erin’s Fiddle was the first dance troupe in the region to become the member of dance association An Coimisiún le Rincí Gaelacha (CLRG), the oldest and biggest association of Irish dancers and Irish dance teachers. The membership in this association binds the troupe to teach Irish dance in a traditional way, and it also gives it an opportunity to compete in many international competitions, as well as to qualify for European and World championships. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are the first to have an official Irish dance instructor who has passed the assessment and gained the title of the ""Conditional Teacher"" in Ireland. She is currently working hard preparing for the final exam which will make us a permanent member of this association.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have performed in the biggest halls in Serbia. We are the first school from our region to have participants in European championship. We have attended 10 competitions all over Europe. We have practiced dancing in all sorts of conditions and we don't like to complain about it - it made us stronger!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of the most important parts of our work and determination are children. We are all familiar with the fact that most of children nowadays are not intereseted in sprots and culture in our country. We are trying to fight this by providing them with wonderful environment, great role models in their older fellow dancers, teaching them patience and spreading love for dancing, acting and team work. We are so proud of our kids and we are happy to help them find their way in life. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the last two years, we were determined to take a new step and we managed to make our own dancing studio. It is modest and nice. Even though we finally found our place, it has never been really finished and used to its fullest potential. We still need a proper bathroom with a shower, new windows and doors and dance floor. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Everything we do, we do on our own and with the help of our friends. We make our own costumes, organize the shows, deal with the marketing world, learn new steps every day etc. Our teachers are choreographers as well, practically doing their job voluntarily. Each year we deliver innovative and spectacular shows which push the boundaries of Irish dance performance in our region. Our troupe counts around 80 dancers, children and adults, and around 20 dancers that are advanced professional performers competing and performing regularly.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Erin's Fiddle was made out of love for dancing and great companionship and it grows on that to this day. Unfortunately, some things are depending on money and there is not much we can do about that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since we can barely cover all costs and bills every month, any kind of renovating on our own is not in the near future. This is where you come in. We are thankful for any kind of help!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p><b>How Can I Help?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To help us make better environment and conditions for dancing and practicing you can help by donating. Our campaign goal is $7.000, which will cover repairs that include: bathroom renovating, changing very old windows and doors and buying a better dance floor. Donations in any amount are critical in helping us make our studio better, so that we can continue doing what we do best.</p>
<p><b>Thank You!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p>
<p>If we do this, we are going to have much safer, warmer and more comfortable environment for dancing. If you go through the gallery you will see how old the windows and the bathroom are. No need to explain why we have to do something about that. And for the floor.. We have some improvisation of what it should be but we keep tearing it and it just falls apart slowly since we are mostly step dancing. We really need a more durable floor, it's a matter of safety.</p>
<p>This studio is our second home! We are excited to make these much-needed repairs and upgrades a reality, and we are grateful for your generosity.</p>

We are the first to have an official Irish dance instructor who has passed the assessment and gained the title of the ""Conditional Teacher"" in Ireland. She is currently working hard preparing for the final exam which will make us a permanent member of this association.
We have performed in the biggest halls in Serbia. We are the first school from our region to have participants in European championship. We have attended 10 competitions all over Europe. We have practiced dancing in all sorts of conditions and we don't like to complain about it - it made us stronger!
One of the most important parts of our work and determination are children. We are all familiar with the fact that most of children nowadays are not intereseted in sprots and culture in our country. We are trying to fight this by providing them with wonderful environment, great role models in their older fellow dancers, teaching them patience and spreading love for dancing, acting and team work. We are so proud of our kids and we are happy to help them find their way in life. 
During the last two years, we were determined to take a new step and we managed to make our own dancing studio. It is modest and nice. Even though we finally found our place, it has never been really finished and used to its fullest potential. We still need a proper bathroom with a shower, new windows and doors and dance floor. 
Everything we do, we do on our own and with the help of our friends. We make our own costumes, organize the shows, deal with the marketing world, learn new steps every day etc. Our teachers are choreographers as well, practically doing their job voluntarily. Each year we deliver innovative and spectacular shows which push the boundaries of Irish dance performance in our region. Our troupe counts around 80 dancers, children and adults, and around 20 dancers that are advanced professional performers competing and performing regularly.  
 

 
Erin's Fiddle was made out of love for dancing and great companionship and it grows on that to this day. Unfortunately, some things are depending on money and there is not much we can do about that.
Since we can barely cover all costs and bills every month, any kind of renovating on our own is not in the near future. This is where you come in. We are thankful for any kind of help!
 
How Can I Help?
To help us make better environment and conditions for dancing and practicing you can help by donating. Our campaign goal is $7.000, which will cover repairs that include: bathroom renovating, changing very old windows and doors and buying a better dance floor. Donations in any amount are critical in helping us make our studio better, so that we can continue doing what we do best.
Thank You!
 
If we do this, we are going to have much safer, warmer and more comfortable environment for dancing. If you go through the gallery you will see how old the windows and the bathroom are. No need to explain why we have to do something about that. And for the floor.. We have some improvisation of what it should be but we keep tearing it and it just falls apart slowly since we are mostly step dancing. We really need a more durable floor, it's a matter of safety.
This studio is our second home! We are excited to make these much-needed repairs and upgrades a reality, and we are grateful for your generosity.

<br/><p>Originally from France, I am an international choreographer currently residing in Los Angeles. I’ve dreamt of bringing my ideas and visions to life while inspiring others to do so by collaborating and spotlighting amazing dancers. I discovered dancehall 20 years ago in France. Since then I’ve taken on this mission to bring this amazing dance and culture to the forefront by teaching and travelling professionally all over the world. I’ve trained and studied the history of dancehall and its core with all my heart, love, and respect for over two decades. Today, I can say that I am the woman I am largely because of this expression!</p>

<p>THE PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>Ludens Ensemble presents ‘Macbeth: without words ’. A stark and stylised performance of this most familiar of tales, of boundless ambition and greed and the destruction it ultimately wreaks. Three actors perform all the characters on stage accompanied by video mapping projections and animation, a dynamic DJ set and a darkly brooding sound world, transforming Shakespeare’s words and narrative into a visual language of potent imagery and movement. This dramatic cluster of images incorporates Expressionism with Brecht and silent era film aesthetics, creating a powerful interpretation of Macbeth’s rapid rise to power and even more precipitous fall. </p>

ABOUT (Introduce yourself and your background)
Ludens Ensemble is an Edinburgh-based theatre group which works with live music, masks, puppets, projections and animation, creating performances that ebb and flow between the aesthetics of critical distance and immersive experience. 
Our first performance 'Macbeth: without words' was performed at the Hidden Door Festival in 2015 and in Cyprus as part of the ‘Pafos’ European Capital of Culture 2017 celebrations.

Australia and we have launched this campaign in an effort to assist the winners
of the 2015 National Street Dance Championships reach their goal of representing
Australia at the world’s largest street dance competition, UDO World Street
Dance Championship, in the UK at the end of August. <h3>
</h3>
<p>We are also the Director of Masters of Choreography
and we have brought this competition to Australia
with the belief that we have exceptional talent and creativity here that we
know can competitively represent Australia on a global arena.</p>
<p>We believe that this competition is much needed as
it provides dancers and their teams with an opportunity to compete to represent
Australia
and to showcase their talent, skills and creativity on a world stage. </p>
<p>Having lived in the UK for a decade, we know we have
the talent right here that can bring back the trophies and be called World
Street Dance Champions.</p>
<p>As <strong>every single cent raised will go to the dancers</strong>,
your involvement is extremely valuable in contributing to the dreams and
aspirations of every competitor. To win a trophy will be fantastic, to win
funds to help a dancer represent Australia at the world’s largest
street dance competition……..that’s what dreams are made of!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The more we raise for these dancers, the better! It’s not
easy to fly to the UK
when you are part of large team of dancers. That’s why every single cent raised
will go directly to the winners of the National finals in May. We need a lot of money to send every winner of this competition to the UK, however, this year we want to raise $15,000 so that we can help cover some of their costs. This is our first year of competition so as this competition grows each year and we gather more support from the street dance community, we hope to raise more and more until we are able to fly every winner to the UK without needing any further financial assistance. With everyone's help, the dancers will only need to focus on their dancing and becoming champions!</p>
<p>In gratitude for your contribution, we can offer you the
following:</p>
<p><strong>Up to $30 – An e-Certificate of Appreciation </strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Up to $50 – An e-Certificate of Appreciations and an entry ticket to the
competition on May 30 in Melbourne (MSAC).</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Up to $100 – An e-Certificate of Appreciation, 2 x entry
ticket to the competition on May 30 (MSAC) in Melbourne and a DVD of the
competition (Posted at a later date)</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Over $100 – all the above plus a T-shirt (Provided on
competition day or posted at a later date) and a further 2 tickets (Total of 4
tickets)</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Over $1000 – all of the above plus a further 16 tickets
(Total of 20 tickets)</strong></p>
<p>We need your support. We need to show these dancers that we
believe in them, that we believe that they can wave the Aussie flag on behalf
of street dance. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This fundraiser has been created for all monies to be given to
the dancers. This fundraiser is to reward the solo dancers, the duos and the
dance teams for their endless hours of discipline, dedication and passion for
dance. </p>
<p>We brought this competition to Australia because we believe in the
culture of street dance and we believe in the talent that exists on our shores.
We wanted a competition that could be challenging, fun and purely for the
dancers.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Street dancers love to compete. They love to come together
under one roof to compete against others as well as to learn and observe the
moves from their colleagues in dance. It is a community that lives and breathes
for the street dance culture. For many, it is their only physical and creative
outlet and the competition is the perfect platform for them to combine this raw
energy, skill and talent. It is their time to shine!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The beauty of this particular campaign is that there is no
risk, at all! We are hosting this competition and we are proud to say that we
are expecting to have a fantastic event at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic
Centre on Saturday, May 30. </p>
<p><strong>Every cent raised is going to the winners, it is up to you to
decide how much they will receive.</strong> If we raise sufficient that nobody has to
dip into their own pockets to travel to the UK, absolutely brilliant. If we do
not, then what we have raised will undoubtedly still be a great boost to the
dancers efforts to reach the UK
to dance for Australia.
It is a win-win!</p>
<p>We are hoping that we can all demonstrate the support that
the street dance community holds from family, friends and the corporate
industry. By this form of expression we hope to show potential sponsors and
government departments that this competition and its participants are worthy of
their financial support. </p>
<p>Whether you can contribute financially or whether your
contribution is in the form of promoting our event on your social mediums such
as Facebook or using the Indiegogo share tools, it will all be extremely
appreciated and we will always be grateful. </p>

<p>We all like to eavesdrop on other

audience members a bigger glimpse into strangers’ worlds. Instead of watching

audience member. And now, after being on stage for over 10 years, I’m looking

<p>At the start, audience members will get
a set of wireless headphones and a map of downtown Fort Collins, with a few

</u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
NASA Space program sends two astronauts on a widely publicized lunar mission. Fred, the
mission commander is already an astronaut of national renown, with a number of successful missions under his belt. He is joined by Ditch, a
bright, young, media savvy upstart on his first space mission. Comic relief is provided by Les,
the homophobic mission control chief. During the tense moments before mission
launch, Ditch suddenly declares his love for Fred. Is this true love or just a moment of
catharsis and hero worship?</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sexual tension overwhelms this confined space capsule, but is everything as it really seems?
When the astronaut’s workplace kiss is revealed live on national TV during a broadcast, their
relationship begins to deteriorate. The pragmatic Ditch will do whatever it takes to further his career ambitions, while Fred is finally willing and ready to live his truth. Can the two rocket men put aside their personal emotions  to see this high stakes mission through to success or will their ill timed lip lock lead to disaster.....only time will tell. <br/><br/><b>Show Location: <br/><a href=""http://fringenyc.org/Festival/venues/venue-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>VENUE #2: </strong>Flamboyan Theatre at the Clemente</a><br/>107 Suffolk Street<br/>(between Rivington &amp; Delancey)</b><br/><br/><b>TICKETS ARE NOW AVAILABLE - CLICK ON A DATE BELOW FOR MORE INFO: <br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-air-endless-water-fringenyc-tickets-17727587692"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WEDNESDAY - AUGUST 19TH 4:45 PM</a><br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-air-endless-water-fringenyc-tickets-17727605746"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FRIDAY - AUGUST 21ST 2:15 PM</a><br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-air-endless-water-fringenyc-tickets-17727663920"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MONDAY - AUGUST 24TH 9:15 PM</a><br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-air-endless-water-fringenyc-tickets-17727675956"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WEDNESDAY - AUGUST 26TH 7:00 PM</a><br/><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/endless-air-endless-water-fringenyc-tickets-17727697019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FRIDAY - AUGUST 28TH 9:30 PM</a><br/></b></p>
<p><b><u>Why this play? Why now?
</u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This play asks its audience whether America is ready for gay people as heroic figures. Our
company believes this question is even more relevant today than when this play was first
written in the late 80’s and early 90’s. More recently we are seeing an increased visibility for publicly gay figures such as new reporter Anderson Cooper, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and the first openly gay U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin.  The questions raised by this play will leave
the audience thinking and struggling with important questions about masculinity, hero
worship, gender, and the struggle of living openly gay in America. With the repeal of the U.S. Military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy and the recent Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage this is a topic on the minds of many Americans. </p>
<p><b><u>The Production</u></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Blue Comet Company has been looking to bring a “space play” to the stage. We
understand the unique challenges of setting a stage play in space, but are looking forward to
facing this challenge head on under the visionary and creative direction of Michael Damico.
Our discovery of this previously un-produced play presents The Blue Comet Company and the
New York International Fringe Festival with an opportunity to host a World Premiere production
written by award winning playwright, Robert Shaffron (Bums, Samuel French, 2004)</p>

The
NASA Space program sends two astronauts on a widely publicized lunar mission. Fred, the
mission commander is already an astronaut of national renown, with a number of successful missions under his belt. He is joined by Ditch, a
bright, young, media savvy upstart on his first space mission. Comic relief is provided by Les,
the homophobic mission control chief. During the tense moments before mission
launch, Ditch suddenly declares his love for Fred. Is this true love or just a moment of
catharsis and hero worship?












Sexual tension overwhelms this confined space capsule, but is everything as it really seems?
When the astronaut’s workplace kiss is revealed live on national TV during a broadcast, their
relationship begins to deteriorate. The pragmatic Ditch will do whatever it takes to further his career ambitions, while Fred is finally willing and ready to live his truth. Can the two rocket men put aside their personal emotions  to see this high stakes mission through to success or will their ill timed lip lock lead to disaster.....only time will tell. Show Location: VENUE #2: Flamboyan Theatre at the Clemente107 Suffolk Street(between Rivington & Delancey)TICKETS ARE NOW AVAILABLE - CLICK ON A DATE BELOW FOR MORE INFO: WEDNESDAY - AUGUST 19TH 4:45 PMFRIDAY - AUGUST 21ST 2:15 PMMONDAY - AUGUST 24TH 9:15 PMWEDNESDAY - AUGUST 26TH 7:00 PMFRIDAY - AUGUST 28TH 9:30 PM
Why this play? Why now?

This play asks its audience whether America is ready for gay people as heroic figures. Our
company believes this question is even more relevant today than when this play was first
written in the late 80’s and early 90’s. More recently we are seeing an increased visibility for publicly gay figures such as new reporter Anderson Cooper, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and the first openly gay U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin.  The questions raised by this play will leave
the audience thinking and struggling with important questions about masculinity, hero
worship, gender, and the struggle of living openly gay in America. With the repeal of the U.S. Military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy and the recent Supreme Court decision on same sex marriage this is a topic on the minds of many Americans. 
The Production
The Blue Comet Company has been looking to bring a “space play” to the stage. We
understand the unique challenges of setting a stage play in space, but are looking forward to
facing this challenge head on under the visionary and creative direction of Michael Damico.

New York International Fringe Festival with an opportunity to host a World Premiere production
