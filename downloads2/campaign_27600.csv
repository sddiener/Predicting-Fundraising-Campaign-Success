Pay-It-Forward

“A life lived for others, is the only life worth living.” Albert Einstein
Ten years ago in rural Nepal, a community built a school where there was no school. 



It was the pride of the community. 
Now, it is destroyed due to the devastating earthquakes in Nepal.
The genesis of The Devisthan Primary School grew from a trek made to Everest Base Camp by American Don Wilks in 2000,  where he met porter Tanka Kapri, a university student hauling bags to pay for his tuition. 


Don sponsored Tanka in last two and a half years of studies with an agreement that Tanka Pay-It-Forward
Tanka’s vision was to build a school in his village and with financial help from Don’s family and friends, the materials were purchased and the community built the school.
Little Devisthan Primary in turn formed the foundation of The Global Community for Education, a small, grassroots organization founded in 2005 that has now built and supported four schools in rural Nepal,  currently serving over 700 children. You can read the full story here: The Route Revision.



A simple question: Why does Global Community for Education exist?
GCE exists to educate children in a remote corner of Nepal, in agrarian communities often neglected by Nepalese government and the rest of the world. 





After the recent devastating earthquakes, we expect these communities will again be ignored or be relegated to the bottom of the list of aid priorities. The only cavalry  coming to help these communities is the one we send, and we need your help.
What it will take to rebuild:We are seeking $7,000 to fund our Emergency Response.  GCE's Nepal Country Director hired a Jeep and made six relief runs to GCE’s communities with tarpaulins, medicines, food, plastic bags to store salvaged rice, and other necessary supplies.We are also seeking $25,000 to rebuild the destroyed Devisthan Primary School, GCE’s first school project. We will be assessing the possibility of using non-traditional reused/recycled materials that will not only benefit the environment, but will be more resistant to earthquake damage. Total Requirements: $32,000The goal of this project is simple: get the school rebuilt and get the children back in their classrooms.The ImpactTo date, GCE has educated and created hope in the lives of 1,378 Nepali children. Current enrollment: 822 children are presently enrolled in GCE schools. GCE Founder, Don Wilks covers all administrative costs.  95% of donations are applied to building schools and the remaining 5% are applied to capital improvements.

Our popular culture reinforces the idea that travel is difficult and expensive. But we know that if you put your mind to something you can make it happen.

This is where we started to envision Our Trip Around the World and all the possible benefits we could bring to people.</p><p>There are millions of children and people in need all around the world. Everyday something bad happens to the new ones and there is not always help for them. Of course there are many humanitarian organizations like UNICEF, Human in need, Amnesty International or Doctors without borders but these organizations cannot be everywhere and unfortunately are not able to help everyone who needs and calls for it.

Our popular culture reinforces the idea that travel is difficult and expensive. But we know that if you put your mind to something you can make it happen. So we have raised the money and are ready to go but we want to further our purpose as we travel 4 continents and 25 countries. This project we call „Our trip around the World“.3. And we also have a super idea – to help!Young people think outside the box, push boundaries and experiment with the new. We want to be part of this change and show people that adventure is waiting for them and they can live to travel AND help people in need. This is where we started to envision Our Trip Around the World and all the possible benefits we could bring to people.There are millions of children and people in need all around the world. Everyday something bad happens to the new ones and there is not always help for them. Of course there are many humanitarian organizations like UNICEF, Human in need, Amnesty International or Doctors without borders but these organizations cannot be everywhere and unfortunately are not able to help everyone who needs and calls for it. There is no one in this world to redeem them all, not even us. But, we can at least try to help some of these people during our round the world trip.4. Whom we are going to help and how!We mainly want to focus on small children or families living in poverty and finding their shelters in orphanages. Why we chose them? These people need help and normally do not get a chance to receive anything from humanitarian organizations.5. How we want to donateFirst of all we want to point out on people’s situation by going to these shelters and write their stories. We believe that writing about them will force people think more about this problematic.All the money we gain thanks to this crowdfunding campaign will be donated as follows:1/3 of the collected money will be sent directly to UNICEF after the campaign ends. The proof of this act will be shown on our website www.ourtriparoundtheworld.com with a confirmation from our bank account statement.The rest of the collected money will be then used during our travels.  We decided not to give them money because there is a suspect that they might never get them.

<div><b>Every $1 counts.. make a small contribution and feel like you have done something great today</b></div> <p></p>
</div>I am Daniel Travolto. I am long time friend of Togbe in Ghana. He is an absolutely amazing person. He runs a fitness studio, makes music &amp; helps disabled children and also kids to stay in shape. Whats amazing about him is he brings so much positiveness to the kids and while there a lot of scammers in Africa this dude is the real deal.

<p>The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is bursting with
creative minds. The region is rife with spirit, music and innovation, but the picture being painted
of the Middle East often shows us the opposite. The Word is Yours
Festival is here to challenge that image and to celebrate the people and
creative culture that is thriving there. But a good festival needs people. People
like you. Every amount donated will go directly to sustaining the creative arts
scene in the MENA and nurturing a network of creative and innovative minds. </p>
<p>I<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">t takes a lot to put on a
festival of this caliber – and we need your help</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to make The Word Is Yours Festival a reality. By being a founding contributor, your help will give urban youth culture in the Middle East a push forward. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This festival doesn't just bring in </span>renowned<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and upcoming artists from all over the region to meet, create, perform, skate, and build - it aims
to invest in culture long-term, and in sustained creative industries in Jordan and The Middle East.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Each amount
of money donated – no matter the size – funds the creation of a platform that
will return dividends for years to come.

<h3>
<span><br/></span>Who We Are &amp; Our Vision </h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are four young women who for the past 11 months have been working pro-bono to arrange the first interregional urban festival in Amman, and our vision is now transforming into a reality. Our production companies <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mektoubconsulting%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MEKTOUB</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/malahico"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MALAHI</a> have joined forces and have over 10 years of experience with producing cultural events as well as non-profit initiatives across Jordan and the region. </p>
<p>Together, we will be flying in artists from MENA from disciplines of rap, dj'ing, dancing, spoken word, production, street art and skateboarding as well as establishing a network of creatives, where panel discussions and artist talks will take place between artists from the MENA region and industry representatives to discuss challenges and raise ideas on how to foster a creative industry in Jordan and throughout the region. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We believe that culture is a vital tool for the socio-economic development of Jordan, which is a knowledge-based society. Due to the Syrian crisis, more jobs will need to be created in alternative sectors and this festival will also serve as a meeting place for refugees and local Jordanians, contributing to social cohesion issues between host-community and refugee groups. </span><br/></p>
<p>Through music, art, conversations and workshops - we aim to bring all these groups together, to show that the word is ours - and does not belong to agents who portray a negative image of youth in MENA. </p>
<p></p>

Putting on a festival is no easy feat and all of these benefits come at a cost. In addition to the regular production cost of festivals – audio and visual, lighting, security, stage rental, artist fees, etc. – the scope of The Word Is Yours presents extra expenses. For instance, we will be bussing in youth from the nearby refugee camps as they are seldom provided the opportunity to leave the camps and this festival is created with them in mind. As an extremely marginalized group, refugee youth are not often awarded the feeling of belonging nor empowerment. The Word Is Yours will provide that, but we have to cover the costs of transportation to the festival.<p></p>
<p><b>The Word Is Yours</b> involves creating a community of creatives throughout the entire MENA region. We have artists coming from Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, UAE, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. It is important for artists to meet each other and collaborate in person. It is necessary for the region to have solidarity. It is also an added expense to fly in these artists from their respective bases. </p>
</div> <p>What your donations will help fund:</p> <ul> <li>The target of 10.000 USD will cover a part of all the expenses that are involved with producing a large-scale festival such as materials for: workshops (paint, brushes, teachers for youth), transportation of youth, transport for artists, establishing a creative hub hosting artists and creatives, AU/AV stages, projection of films, local permits and taxes and a small remuneration fee for artists. </li> <li>You'll be a founding backer of the first interregional festival in The Middle East focusing on urban culture!</li> <li>This festival is all about co-creation, and we are open to your ideas, and your word. Word up. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact &amp; Reach</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over half of Jordan’s population is under the age of 25.
This number is quickly increasing from an influx of refugees. The youth
demographic in this region is integral for the future development of the sense
of community as well as the economic direction. 
These young minds are an untapped source for lifting the cultural
threads of the region and stimulating the dialogue around the future of the
MENA. Not only will The Word Is Yours provide a weekend of creative expression
woven through multiple disciplines of urban life, but it will show how fruitful
the creative arts is for the community and – more importantly – that creativity
is a skill that can become a livelihood. <span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440079246/upx5m2zaif2angjzishu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<b><span><br/></span></b><h3>What We Will Do</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>TWIY will reach an estimated 1500 youth in Amman and 150 refugee youth<br/></span></li> <li>Workshops and master-classes will be held in 5 locations across Amman</li> <li>Activities will not end with festival, a regional network will be set up</li>
<li>Classes such as production and DJ'ing will help qualify youth to work and make money regardless of social or economic background</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<div>In Jordan’s capital city of Amman, The Word Is Yours will be hosted by 7Hills Skatepark, the first outdoor community skate park in Jordan. Located in downtown Amman, the skate park is easily accessible for all – including some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Due to Jordan’s central placement in the Middle East – it
has an important role to play in culture and politics of the whole region. Amman
is considered one of the “safe havens” for refugees in the Middle East leading
to an influx of Syrians, Palestinians and Iraqis seeking safety within the
borders of the city. Many of these refugees are confined to camps and are rarely
offered the opportunity to leave – with children being some of the most
strongly affected. Staying true to 7Hill’s philosophy of providing all children
with an opportunity to experience skate culture, The Word Is Yours will be
bussing in children and youth from nearby refugee camps to simply allow them to
be young for a day.</p>
<h3>The Festival &amp; Activities </h3>
<span>
<p><b>Day 1 – What’s Your Word?</b></p>
<p>Kicking off at 7Hills Skatepark the premiere day of the
festival includes:<br/>
<br/>
• A <b>skateboard deck painting workshop</b>
conducted by noted arabesque and calligraffiti artists in partnership with
<a href=""http://www.aptart.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AptART</a> – these decks will then become part of the 7Hills loaner equipment
program.</p>
<p>• An impressive roster of regional <b>DJ’s, rappers, and beatboxers</b> will be showcasing their great works,
beats, and rhymes throughout the day’s festivities. <span><br/></span><br/>
• There will be <b>competitions for
skateboarders and dancers</b> with a judging panel of international
professionals.  Followed by the judges
showing their own bag of tricks.</p>
<p>• Finally, there will be an <b>‘Open Mic’ to invite the audience</b>, MC’s, poets, and spoken word
artists to demonstrate their lyrical skills; finishing with the reminder to all
that the word, ultimately, is theirs.</p>
<p><b>Day 2  - For Artists, By Artists</b></p>
<p>At Al Locanda Boutique hotel,  it is time for the artists to work on their
craft rather than perform it. </p>
<p>• <b>Workshops </b>will
be held to provide an opportunity for any festival goers from day one to take
the first steps in getting involved with any of the creative skills they
witnessed the day before.  </p>
<p>• <b>Artists’ Talks</b> will
open avenues for discourse about four general topics: (1)strengthening cross-
collaboration and boosting creative industry, (2)legal rights and obligations
for artists, (3)Arab sample culture, and (4)the current state of Hip Hop in the
MENA region.  Each talk will be moderated
by an invited, respected moderator in their field. </p>
<p>• A <b>live-streamed,
mind-blowing DJ set</b> culminating the festivals artists and events we will
conclude the The Word Is Yours with an after party  on Al Locanda’s panoramic rooftop. Going out
with a bang, a view, and a rooftop full of smiles.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p></span>

<br/></div>","The First Urban Festival In The Middle East


The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is bursting with
creative minds. The region is rife with spirit, music and innovation, but the picture being painted
of the Middle East often shows us the opposite. The Word is Yours
Festival is here to challenge that image and to celebrate the people and
creative culture that is thriving there. But a good festival needs people. People
like you. Every amount donated will go directly to sustaining the creative arts
scene in the MENA and nurturing a network of creative and innovative minds. 
It takes a lot to put on a
festival of this caliber – and we need your help to make The Word Is Yours Festival a reality. By being a founding contributor, your help will give urban youth culture in the Middle East a push forward. 

This festival doesn't just bring in renowned and upcoming artists from all over the region to meet, create, perform, skate, and build - it aims
to invest in culture long-term, and in sustained creative industries in Jordan and The Middle East.Each amount
of money donated – no matter the size – funds the creation of a platform that
will return dividends for years to come. 
Stand with us and invest in culture; invest in a progressing community. 



Who We Are & Our Vision 

We are four young women who for the past 11 months have been working pro-bono to arrange the first interregional urban festival in Amman, and our vision is now transforming into a reality. Our production companies MEKTOUB and MALAHI have joined forces and have over 10 years of experience with producing cultural events as well as non-profit initiatives across Jordan and the region. 
Together, we will be flying in artists from MENA from disciplines of rap, dj'ing, dancing, spoken word, production, street art and skateboarding as well as establishing a network of creatives, where panel discussions and artist talks will take place between artists from the MENA region and industry representatives to discuss challenges and raise ideas on how to foster a creative industry in Jordan and throughout the region. 
We believe that culture is a vital tool for the socio-economic development of Jordan, which is a knowledge-based society. Due to the Syrian crisis, more jobs will need to be created in alternative sectors and this festival will also serve as a meeting place for refugees and local Jordanians, contributing to social cohesion issues between host-community and refugee groups. 
Through music, art, conversations and workshops - we aim to bring all these groups together, to show that the word is ours - and does not belong to agents who portray a negative image of youth in MENA. 





  The Word Is Yours (TWIY) have already teamed up with a number of media partners, local creative spaces in Al Weibdeh (Amman) as well as 7Hills Skatepark - the first community skatepark in Jordan (funded on Indiegogo). 
TWIY is a FREE and non-profit festival for ALL!  Line-up includes artists from 10 countries and 9 artistic disciplines. 
TWIY respects freedom of artistic expression, human and gender rights and will include female performers and participants in order to break down stereotypes and build empowerment amongst youth.

What We Need & What You GetWith your help of a donation of any amount – we can
guarantee that your contribution goes directly to the production of The Word Is Yours as well as compensation and/or
transportation of artists, materials for workshops and transporting marginalized youth to the festival.  With your donation, The Word is Yours will be able to:



· 
Initiate the first ever interregional festival in Jordan
· Create a platform and network for artists to collaborate and further the creative industry in Amman and cities all over the MENA
· 
Provide an experience for youth (including those in refugee camps) 
· Substantiate the loaner equipment program for 7Hills Skatepark
· 
Support the long lasting decoration of walls and murals throughout the city by international and regional noted graffiti artists
· Highlight the opportunities for creative youth in Amman within their own city
· Stimulate the local economy in Amman by
featuring local businesses and increasing tourism demands. 




Putting on a festival is no easy feat and all of these benefits come at a cost. In addition to the regular production cost of festivals – audio and visual, lighting, security, stage rental, artist fees, etc. – the scope of The Word Is Yours presents extra expenses. For instance, we will be bussing in youth from the nearby refugee camps as they are seldom provided the opportunity to leave the camps and this festival is created with them in mind. As an extremely marginalized group, refugee youth are not often awarded the feeling of belonging nor empowerment. The Word Is Yours will provide that, but we have to cover the costs of transportation to the festival.
The Word Is Yours involves creating a community of creatives throughout the entire MENA region. We have artists coming from Jordan, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, UAE, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. It is important for artists to meet each other and collaborate in person. It is necessary for the region to have solidarity. It is also an added expense to fly in these artists from their respective bases. 
 What your donations will help fund:  The target of 10.000 USD will cover a part of all the expenses that are involved with producing a large-scale festival such as materials for: workshops (paint, brushes, teachers for youth), transportation of youth, transport for artists, establishing a creative hub hosting artists and creatives, AU/AV stages, projection of films, local permits and taxes and a small remuneration fee for artists.  You'll be a founding backer of the first interregional festival in The Middle East focusing on urban culture! This festival is all about co-creation, and we are open to your ideas, and your word. Word up. 


Impact & Reach


Over half of Jordan’s population is under the age of 25.
This number is quickly increasing from an influx of refugees. The youth
demographic in this region is integral for the future development of the sense
of community as well as the economic direction. 
These young minds are an untapped source for lifting the cultural
threads of the region and stimulating the dialogue around the future of the
MENA. Not only will The Word Is Yours provide a weekend of creative expression
woven through multiple disciplines of urban life, but it will show how fruitful
the creative arts is for the community and – more importantly – that creativity
is a skill that can become a livelihood. 




What We Will Do

TWIY will reach an estimated 1500 youth in Amman and 150 refugee youth Workshops and master-classes will be held in 5 locations across Amman Activities will not end with festival, a regional network will be set up
Classes such as production and DJ'ing will help qualify youth to work and make money regardless of social or economic background


In Jordan’s capital city of Amman, The Word Is Yours will be hosted by 7Hills Skatepark, the first outdoor community skate park in Jordan. Located in downtown Amman, the skate park is easily accessible for all – including some of the poorest neighborhoods in the city.


Due to Jordan’s central placement in the Middle East – it
has an important role to play in culture and politics of the whole region. Amman
is considered one of the “safe havens” for refugees in the Middle East leading
to an influx of Syrians, Palestinians and Iraqis seeking safety within the
borders of the city. Many of these refugees are confined to camps and are rarely
offered the opportunity to leave – with children being some of the most
strongly affected. Staying true to 7Hill’s philosophy of providing all children
with an opportunity to experience skate culture, The Word Is Yours will be
bussing in children and youth from nearby refugee camps to simply allow them to
be young for a day.
The Festival & Activities 

Day 1 – What’s Your Word?
Kicking off at 7Hills Skatepark the premiere day of the
festival includes:

• A skateboard deck painting workshop
conducted by noted arabesque and calligraffiti artists in partnership with
AptART – these decks will then become part of the 7Hills loaner equipment
program.
• An impressive roster of regional DJ’s, rappers, and beatboxers will be showcasing their great works,
beats, and rhymes throughout the day’s festivities. 
• There will be competitions for
skateboarders and dancers with a judging panel of international
professionals.  Followed by the judges
showing their own bag of tricks.
• Finally, there will be an ‘Open Mic’ to invite the audience, MC’s, poets, and spoken word
artists to demonstrate their lyrical skills; finishing with the reminder to all
that the word, ultimately, is theirs.
Day 2  - For Artists, By Artists
At Al Locanda Boutique hotel,  it is time for the artists to work on their
craft rather than perform it. 
• Workshops will
be held to provide an opportunity for any festival goers from day one to take
the first steps in getting involved with any of the creative skills they
witnessed the day before.  
• Artists’ Talks will
open avenues for discourse about four general topics: (1)strengthening cross-
collaboration and boosting creative industry, (2)legal rights and obligations
for artists, (3)Arab sample culture, and (4)the current state of Hip Hop in the
MENA region.  Each talk will be moderated
by an invited, respected moderator in their field. 
• A live-streamed,
mind-blowing DJ set culminating the festivals artists and events we will
conclude the The Word Is Yours with an after party  on Al Locanda’s panoramic rooftop. Going out
with a bang, a view, and a rooftop full of smiles.

    The Word is also Yours!  
We thank you kindly for supporting our cause and for helping
us to make it a reality. Every tiny donation helps. We greatly believe in this
festival and we greatly believe that with the power of creativity and the
support of creative outlets – The Word is Yours will be the first step towards investing in youth and culture, and together we can make the word ours for years to come.   Salamat, TWIY-team",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Donate by October 8th to launch the new Robbin Mackbee Firefighter Youth Academy in Vallejo<br/>
</h3>

As firefighters in urban environments, they responded to
increasing numbers of medical emergencies that resulted from acts of violence.
Far too often, it was young African-American males who were both the
perpetrators and the victims of violence, suffering serious injury and death. </p>
<p>As first responders, firefighters had a chance to build on the
community’s trust and to prevent future violence. The idea of the <a href=""http://www.firefighteryouthacademy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Firefighter Youth Academy</a> was born. The academy’s purpose is simple: to share the
firefighting career and provide professional guidance and life skills to any young
teenagers at risk of social, economic, or academic failure. The first
Firefighter Youth Academy was founded in Richmond, California over 20 years
ago, and has helped to change the lives of the youth cadets it has mentored.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Today, retired Battalion
Chief Byron Berhel of the Richmond Fire Department, one of the founders of the Richmond
academy, is on a mission to bring this successful youth mentoring program to
new communities, starting with Vallejo. Berhel is the founder and CEO of a non-profit
called <a href=""http://www.sfary.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Solutions for At Risk Youth</a> (SFARY) that is partnering with the Vallejo
Fire Department and Vallejo Unified School District to bring the Firefighter Youth Academy to this
new community.</span></p>
<p>The
new Robbin Mackbee Firefighter Youth Academy in Vallejo is named in honor of a
fallen Vallejo Fire Department hero. Robbin lost his life 35 years ago in the
line of duty while fighting a grass fire. Known as “Robbie” to friends and
family, he was the youngest ever engineer in the Vallejo Fire Department and was
also a positive community role model who spent time tutoring and mentoring
youth at the local Omega Boys and Girls Club in Vallejo. </p>
<p>Starting
October 3rd, the academy will launch a six-week program that will provide youth
with mentorship from local firefighters, teaching them the importance of
academic achievement, community service, and self-discipline.</p>
<p>With
your donation, you can honor Robbie’s memory by helping to support the new
Robbin Mackbee Firefighter Youth Academy in Vallejo, giving local high school
students the opportunity to participate in the academy.</p>
<div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We need your help to build our academy in Vallejo. Each Saturday
morning for six weeks, the youth “cadets” will meet to learn new skills from
firefighters. The academy will provide food, uniforms, and other training
materials to the cadets. Your donation will help to cover these costs for our young cadets. </p>
<p>To thank you for your support, we have created some unique
giveaways:</p>

<li>A shout-out on social media thanking our donors</li>

In 1991, a group of Richmond firefighters noticed a disturbing trend of violence in their community. As firefighters in urban environments, they responded to
increasing numbers of medical emergencies that resulted from acts of violence.
Far too often, it was young African-American males who were both the
perpetrators and the victims of violence, suffering serious injury and death. 
As first responders, firefighters had a chance to build on the
community’s trust and to prevent future violence. The idea of the Firefighter Youth Academy was born. The academy’s purpose is simple: to share the
firefighting career and provide professional guidance and life skills to any young
teenagers at risk of social, economic, or academic failure. The first
Firefighter Youth Academy was founded in Richmond, California over 20 years
ago, and has helped to change the lives of the youth cadets it has mentored.

Today, retired Battalion
Chief Byron Berhel of the Richmond Fire Department, one of the founders of the Richmond
academy, is on a mission to bring this successful youth mentoring program to
new communities, starting with Vallejo. Berhel is the founder and CEO of a non-profit
called Solutions for At Risk Youth (SFARY) that is partnering with the Vallejo
Fire Department and Vallejo Unified School District to bring the Firefighter Youth Academy to this
new community.
The
new Robbin Mackbee Firefighter Youth Academy in Vallejo is named in honor of a
fallen Vallejo Fire Department hero. Robbin lost his life 35 years ago in the
line of duty while fighting a grass fire. Known as “Robbie” to friends and
family, he was the youngest ever engineer in the Vallejo Fire Department and was
also a positive community role model who spent time tutoring and mentoring
youth at the local Omega Boys and Girls Club in Vallejo. 
Starting
October 3rd, the academy will launch a six-week program that will provide youth
with mentorship from local firefighters, teaching them the importance of
academic achievement, community service, and self-discipline.
With
your donation, you can honor Robbie’s memory by helping to support the new
Robbin Mackbee Firefighter Youth Academy in Vallejo, giving local high school
students the opportunity to participate in the academy.
 What We Need & What You Get 

We need your help to build our academy in Vallejo. Each Saturday
morning for six weeks, the youth “cadets” will meet to learn new skills from
firefighters. The academy will provide food, uniforms, and other training
materials to the cadets. Your donation will help to cover these costs for our young cadets. 
To thank you for your support, we have created some unique
giveaways:

A shout-out on social media thanking our donors

“Our Hero” wrist bands

Firefighter Youth Academy t-shirts
An AAA first aid kit
A tour of the new academy

<p><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></b></p>
<p>Founded in
2014, Serenite Foundation is a 501(c) (3) not-for-profit organization providing
support to families dealing with pediatric cancer. Our services include
meal delivery, transportation and academic support for siblings.  All of the families we support are receiving treatment
at hospitals and live at or below the low-income status. For more information
please visit :<b> <a href=""http://www.serenite-foundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Serenite-foundation.org</a></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Why we are
raising funds?</b></p>
<p>Currently there
are 30 families admitted in our local children's hospital  receiving treatment
for various types of cancer. These families are from different areas of
California or out of state, and are temporarily staying in a family house near  hospital for the duration of their child's treatment. </p>
<p>We are seeking
to raise 25K to provide a healthy end of the day meal to these families
upon their return to the family house, after a long day at the
hospital.  Any amount we raise
will fully go to providing meals for these families. Your contribution
will bring some relief to a parent going through a painful journey! </p>
<p>We thank you
for your support! Please share our campaign with your friends and
family. </p>

<p><b>Our goals in more detail:</b></p>
<p>The increasing
number of kids diagnosed with cancer is alarming. That means more and more
families are experiencing this painful ordeal, and they all face a potential
melt down not only emotionally but financially. Although we won’t be able to
solve the root cause of this issue, we are able to make a difference and give a
helping hand. Your tax deductible donations, every single dollar of it, helps
Serenite Foundation maintain  long-term viability in order to support families dealing with
pediatric cancer.</p>
<p><b>Stretch goal
#1: </b></p>
<p>Once we
reach <u>$25,000</u>, we will be able to deliver warm, fresh and healthy
meals to 30 families for 6 months. By increasing the number of families served,
we will be able to bring down the meal cost due to increased volume.  We have local vendors interested in
helping us achieve this goal.  We
will continue to support the current number of families being sponsored until
this goal is met for expansion.</p></span></div>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Stretch goal #2: </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</p>
<p>Once we
reach <u>$80,000</u>, we will further expand our services to provide meals
to 50 families in two (2) different facilities.  Our ongoing strategy will be to reduce meal cost by
partnering with a variety of locally licensed food providers, so we can expand
our reach and support.</p>
<p><b>Stretch goal #3 </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p>Once we go
beyond $80,000, we will be able to expand our services by providing
transportation to families whose child has developed a compromised immune
system.  These children are put at
risk every time they have to share a ride with other passengers in a van, and
especially when having to use public transportation.  This transportation service would enable families to go back
and forth to the doctors’ office and chemo infusion appointments, without worrying
about exposing the children to viruses and germs that could be life
threatening.  This is an important
service since most families are not local, and renting a car for several weeks
is costly.  With this funding, we
will work to secure a local transportation company to assist us with rides or we
will look for a small van donation to Serenite in order to provide these special
patients a ride on an as needed basis.</p>

</div></div>","Who is Serenite Foundation? 


Founded in
2014, Serenite Foundation is a 501(c) (3) not-for-profit organization providing
support to families dealing with pediatric cancer. Our services include
meal delivery, transportation and academic support for siblings.  All of the families we support are receiving treatment
at hospitals and live at or below the low-income status. For more information
please visit : www.Serenite-foundation.org

Why we are
raising funds?
Currently there
are 30 families admitted in our local children's hospital  receiving treatment
for various types of cancer. These families are from different areas of
California or out of state, and are temporarily staying in a family house near  hospital for the duration of their child's treatment. 
We are seeking
to raise 25K to provide a healthy end of the day meal to these families
upon their return to the family house, after a long day at the
hospital.  Any amount we raise
will fully go to providing meals for these families. Your contribution
will bring some relief to a parent going through a painful journey! 
We thank you
for your support! Please share our campaign with your friends and
family. 



Our goals in more detail:
The increasing
number of kids diagnosed with cancer is alarming. That means more and more
families are experiencing this painful ordeal, and they all face a potential
melt down not only emotionally but financially. Although we won’t be able to
solve the root cause of this issue, we are able to make a difference and give a
helping hand. Your tax deductible donations, every single dollar of it, helps
Serenite Foundation maintain  long-term viability in order to support families dealing with
pediatric cancer.
Stretch goal
#1: 
Once we
reach $25,000, we will be able to deliver warm, fresh and healthy
meals to 30 families for 6 months. By increasing the number of families served,
we will be able to bring down the meal cost due to increased volume.  We have local vendors interested in
helping us achieve this goal.  We
will continue to support the current number of families being sponsored until
this goal is met for expansion.

Stretch goal #2: 


Once we
reach $80,000, we will further expand our services to provide meals
to 50 families in two (2) different facilities.  Our ongoing strategy will be to reduce meal cost by
partnering with a variety of locally licensed food providers, so we can expand
our reach and support.
Stretch goal #3 

Once we go
beyond $80,000, we will be able to expand our services by providing
transportation to families whose child has developed a compromised immune
system.  These children are put at
risk every time they have to share a ride with other passengers in a van, and
especially when having to use public transportation.  This transportation service would enable families to go back
and forth to the doctors’ office and chemo infusion appointments, without worrying
about exposing the children to viruses and germs that could be life
threatening.  This is an important
service since most families are not local, and renting a car for several weeks
is costly.  With this funding, we
will work to secure a local transportation company to assist us with rides or we
will look for a small van donation to Serenite in order to provide these special
patients a ride on an as needed basis.



Our meal delivery impact projection:

Reaching our
$25,000 goal means that we will be able to deliver 3,120 meals for 6 months at
the cost of $8 per meal .  That’s
two meals  a week for 26 weeks. The
cost of delivery is included as is the expense of a part time scheduler to
coordinate the efforts between family house, vendors and patients. 

Reaching our
$80,000 goal means that we will be able to provide support to an addition 20  families at the cost of $8 per meal .At this point, we will have maximized our
ability to decrease the meal cost per the volume we have, and we will allocate
remaining funds to rolling out our transportation plan. 

What do our families say about us?
"" Dear Serenite foundation team,

Please accept our dearest appreciation and gratitude for our first dinner service we received on Tuesday night.Having a family member who is dealing with a serious illness, a 6 years old and working long hours makes it very challenging to prepare dinner every night. It was great to come home to warm, delicious and healthy dinner waiting for us!! It made the night go much smoother and allowed for more quality time. Thank you again for your support and kindness !! ""



Your contribution will enable us
to: 
• 
Provide dinner to all the families residing at the local  temporary family housing.
•  Provide transportation to the child with low immune system and ease the pain and stress of getting to appointments on time.
• Help sponsor an increases number of families who are  going through a tough and painful journey.

The objective of this campaign is to raise funds for the production and printing of the second episode of Artery Wars (""Attack of the Worms""). This comic will use colorful graphics and simple text to address the dangers associated with soil parasite infections and what can be done to avoid them in vulnerable communities. Copies will be distributed in the municipal schools of Santa Luzia do Itanhy, one of the poorest counties in Brazil. The campaign will also help fund the translation and printing of both issues into English. CentroNia, a non-profit organization in Washington, DC, will help us distribute the English version in local schools to increase awareness among students about the environmental health hazards hat children their own age face across the world.

Sample Page From First Issue

         Sample Page From First Issue

Problem:Iron deficiency anemia is the world’s greatest nutritional disease, affecting 30% of the world’s population. This disease is linked to cognitive development deficiencies in children, which can have lasting consequences in their health, ability to learn and economic development as adults. Iron deficiency anemia develops due to several causes, and lack of proper nutrition is one of the most common ones. In more vulnerable areas, this condition is exacerbated by infectious diseases like malaria and soil parasites, among others. In Santa Luzia do Itanhy, one of the poorest counties in Brazil, the average rate of students with Iron Deficiency Anemia reaches an alarming 32%. 


Sample Page From First Issue:           





The Solution:


IPTI and several stakeholders such as doctors, nurses, nursing technicians, students and health agents, developed and implemented a social technology in the form of a comic book to reduce the prevalence of anemia in schools. The comic book, Artery Wars, was firstly distributed to 5000 children and their families in Santa Luzia do Itanhy and nearby towns, reducing anemia prevalence to 6.5%. The first episode was called ""Invisible Sabotage"", which incorporated public health solutions to recognize and fight anemia. 


The second episode, ""Attack of the Worms”, will address the issues and dangers associated with soil parasite infections and what can be done to avoid them. We foresee to see a similar impact as we had with the first episode. These episodes will be distributed among students in developed countries to raise awareness of the implications of soil parasites for nutritional health in vulnerable populations. Bringing awareness to these students can help bridge the gap between underserved child and their counterparts, and help build a bridge among diverse community to create a more mindful generation.


The creation of the book was conducted by Luca Fontes, a 16 years old teen together with 8 other students from the community.

<b><u>Frequently Asked Questions:</u></b>
</div><div>
<b></b><p><b>What is CEF’s role in this project?</b></p>
<p>The
Center for Emerging Futures (CEF) -  has spent the last 11 years in Israel
and Palestine facilitating gatherings of Israelis and Palestinians designed to help
them rediscover their shared humanity and see if there are joint projects they
might want to work on together.</p>
<p>When
self-managed groups grow from these meetings and demonstrate leadership that is
a partnership and shares ownership of the vision CEF becomes a support to the
project, particularly in the field of project and often some limited start-up
funds.</p>
<p>CEF
expects that long term funding will come from both the Palestinian Ministry of
Education and grant makers in US, EU and Middle Eastern institutions.  CEF
has learned that those bigger funders want to see a start-up that is active on
the ground and shows existing community support.  For these reasons CEF is
assisting the local non-profit society established in Tarqumiya to raise funds
for this pilot project.  Teacher and staff training is being
offered to Tarqumiya teachers by both Israeli and Palestinian experts in the
field through another grant from the EU that has already been received by
another West Bank school, in part through CEF efforts.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.emergingfutures.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.emergingfutures.org</a></p>
<p><b>Is
$60,000 enough to run a new school?</b></p>
<p>No,
not by itself. Additional funds totaling $25,000 have been raised through other
grants.  More importantly, it should be understood that these funds being
raised are to start a small school with state-of-the art treatment and
education that can be provided now in an area with almost no other
resources.  There are potential funders who have expressed interest in
considering support for a school with 100+ students and a $250,000 budget once
early evidence of need and an ability to respond to the need is established.</p>
<p><b>How
will the Indiegogo money be spent?</b></p>
<p>Approximately
$25,000 will be utilized to upgrade a facility (that cost is low because of the
combined efforts of Israeli and Palestinian volunteers) and this  $60,000
will fund operations for a limited number of students during the first year.
Concurrently, the Tarqumiya society will be raising the much greater funding
needed to gradually build enrollment to 100+ students.</p>
<p><b>Is
this project for real?</b></p>
<p>Yes! 
Grants from the EU for teacher training including Tarqumiya teachers have been
received.  In addition to $10,000 awarded by CEF, the Australian government
recently announced a $15,000 grant for the pilot project. 
Funding this school is a key component of the long-term goal for
the folks from both sides of the conflict who know how important it is to these
children.</p>

Education and grant makers in US, EU and Middle Eastern institutions.  CEF
has learned that those bigger funders want to see a start-up that is active on
the ground and shows existing community support.  For these reasons CEF is
assisting the local non-profit society established in Tarqumiya to raise funds
for this pilot project.  Teacher and staff training is being
offered to Tarqumiya teachers by both Israeli and Palestinian experts in the
field through another grant from the EU that has already been received by
another West Bank school, in part through CEF efforts.
http://www.emergingfutures.org
Is
$60,000 enough to run a new school?
No,
not by itself. Additional funds totaling $25,000 have been raised through other
grants.  More importantly, it should be understood that these funds being
raised are to start a small school with state-of-the art treatment and
education that can be provided now in an area with almost no other
resources.  There are potential funders who have expressed interest in
considering support for a school with 100+ students and a $250,000 budget once
early evidence of need and an ability to respond to the need is established.
How
will the Indiegogo money be spent?
Approximately
$25,000 will be utilized to upgrade a facility (that cost is low because of the
combined efforts of Israeli and Palestinian volunteers) and this  $60,000
will fund operations for a limited number of students during the first year.
Concurrently, the Tarqumiya society will be raising the much greater funding
needed to gradually build enrollment to 100+ students.
Is
this project for real?
Yes! 
Grants from the EU for teacher training including Tarqumiya teachers have been
received.  In addition to $10,000 awarded by CEF, the Australian government
recently announced a $15,000 grant for the pilot project. 
Funding this school is a key component of the long-term goal for
the folks from both sides of the conflict who know how important it is to these
children.

<h2><b>The Power of
Numbers</b></h2>
<h4>A Lonely Struggle<br/>
</h4>
<p>For a long time, I thought I was the only person who
remembered Pope John Paul I. When Cardinal Albino Luciani was elected in 1978, I was immediately
moved by his serenity and joy, his smile and his wonderful catechism lessons. I
read everything I could about him, even after he died so suddenly, just a month
into his promising papacy. I continued to study his life, learning Italian and ordering his
books from Italy, in order to be able to read his writings.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>Then when the furor broke out over the Pope’s death in 1984,
with the publication of <i>In God’s Name</i>
by David Yallop, I thought I was the only one in the English-speaking world who
remembered what John Paul I was really like, and who could refute David Yallop’s
ridiculous theory that the Pope was murdered. That my first visit to Italy to
research, to my translating John Paul I’s writings into English, and years of fruitless
struggle to get a publisher interested in publishing them or the biography of him I was
writing. <br/><br/><h4>Meeting Friends<br/>
</h4>
<p>What helped me more than anything else was discovering that
there were other people who felt the same about John Paul I as I did. Over the
years, in addition to meeting the Luciani family and some of the late Pope's co-workers, I met the Seabecks, the founders of
The Missionary Servants of John Paul I, with whom I finally got some of Luciani's writings published in <i>The Smiling
Pope</i> in 2003. I met many ordinary people who loved him through e-mail,
social media, and my blog. I also met Mo Guernon and Paul Spackman, who had both written about
our Pope. Paul is the author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0852441878?keywords=god%27s%20candidate&amp;qid=1445113861&amp;ref_=sr_1_5&amp;sr=8-5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">God’s Candidate: the Life and Times of John Paul I,</a> and Mo Guernon <a href=""http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20150928/OPINION/150929436"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">has written articles</a> and is also working a biography, to be called <i>Love
Is a Journey: A Portrait of Pope John Paul I</i>. <br/></p>
<h4>What We Found We Could Do Together<br/>
</h4>
<p>In 2012, Mo, Paul and I got together with a few other people
to organize a conference called “The True Pope John Paul I,” which was held in
New York to commemorate the centenary of his birth. Participants included the
Pope’s niece, Pia Luciani, Loris Serafini, a local historian from John Paul I's home town of Canale d'Agordo and Stefania Falasca, who wrote the <i>Positio</i> for his beatification process. We learned many new details about his life, and found out some important information about his death from Pia and from Fr. Joseph Curran,  who was in Rome at the time, and had a very lively discussion of the murder theory. A
local TV station did a great story about it (see the video above). <a href=""https://popejpi.org/index.php/2015/12/03/new-revelations-about-pope-john-paul-i-in-soon-to-be-published-work/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Read our latest press release with many fascinating revelations from the conference.</a><br/></p>

<p>1. To spread accurate knowledge of the life, writing, and 
spirituality of Pope John Paul I through means such as publications,

<p>2. To provide a means for those of any faith who are interested in 
the purpose of the association to obtain information and to network with

<p>We did lots of planning and discussion, and slowly built <a href=""https://popejpi.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our website</a>. We have met new people, including some in different parts of the

<h2><b>John
Paul I and the Jubilee Year</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Jubilee Year of Mercy called by Pope Francis, has many people
discussing the meaning of this virtue. John Paul I’s teaching on mercy is gaining increased
attention as the Church approaches the Jubilee Year, including <a href=""https://popejpi.org/index.php/the-mercy-of-god-explained-by-albino-luciani/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an article by famed Vaticanist Andrea Tornielli</a>.  So the Pope John Paul I Association has started a petition asking Pope Francis to “proclaim and promote the Magisterium of John Paul I
on Mercy during the coming Jubilee Year, and encourage the study of his works.”
It says, in part:</p>
<p>“In his audiences, Papa Luciani taught the
world how to cultivate faith and hope in childlike humility, the better to
trust in God’s mercy. Earlier in his letter to Jesus, he had said: ‘Your whole
manner is that -- this is my impression -- of someone more concerned with the
suffering that sin produces in the sinners than the offense it gives to God. When
you are instilling the hope of forgiveness, You seem to say: “You can't even
imagine the pleasure that your conversion gives me!”’ (<i>Illustrissimi</i>)</p>
<p>“Most famously, he stressed the maternal
quality of God's mercy: ‘God has such tender love for use, even more tender
than the love that a mama has for her children, Isaiah says.’(Sept. 13th
audience). ‘Little children, when they are sick, have one more reason to be
loved by their mothers, and so do we: if we are sick with wickedness, if we
have gone astray, then we have one more reason to be loved by the Lord.’ (Sept
10th Angelus).</p>

</div><b>The Short</b><br/>Do you know about conflict in Myanmar/Burma?  Good news!  There is a cease fire in place!  We should take advantage of the cease fire and move forward to a better situation for others.  We aim to stengthen the economic situation of people in Myanmar/Burma through developing an agriculture business, but we need to work out the details.  This project is to test what options will work and how do we make things work.  <br/>We want to create business for people to earn and bring money into the area, and we will need to test these business ideas out.  <br/>Agriculture development, farmers who have been subsistence farmers want to grow more, enough to sell.  <br/>We want to test ideas out on how to make that happen.  Will option A or option B work?  <br/>I am a veteran who after finishing school fled to hide at Missoula valley in the mountains.  As part of my time in Thailand, I worked with Design and Eliyah.  These men are involved with education and medical treatment with refugees.  We want to create a business partnership working with local farms to modernized farming techniques and increase selling power.  We will test this out on a farming site and use the test site to make food for workers at health clinics.  From what we learn we can move forward to creating business for farmers.  <br/><b>The Plan</b><br/>Since conflict has happened farming land still lays fallow.  Plots of this land belong to certain families.  Working with a family we would clear, plant a plot of land, and give the rice to local health clinic workers.  The land would be cleared using a chain saw, weed trimmer, and tractor, slightly different from the traditional slash and burn technique.  A transplanter would be used for planting as opposed to the traditional broadcasting method.  Transplanting has higher efficiency in labour and seed usage.  The crop would be harvested with a combine, and processed with drying racks.  Tradition is not entirely a bad thing as modern techniques in neighboring areas have created problems with dependency on fertilizers and pesticides.  I do not need my farmers twitching and alternates will have to be worked out.  This project is work and involves much coordination.  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442987098/hxqgy5iihwvs67ixoht1.png"" src="""" style=""width: 373.222px; height: 602px;""/></p><b>The Location<br/></b>The project will occur in Dooplaya District, Karen State of Myanmar.  Why there?  They asked for it.  And this location is far enough from urban locations to avoid rapid shifts in political unrest.  In conversations with people in this area, the topic of funding came up as it often does.  Recommendations were made for making business instead always seeking donations.  These people want to be entrepreneurs but need the help to get started.  While I am asking for donations now, it is a move to avoid donations later.  <br/>Advantages with this location include ready work force, limited military attention (KNU headquarters is located in the North), 1-2 day journey to almost all needed parts of the supply chain, local approval/request, witnessed coordination between different political organizations, distance from the ocean to limit storm effects, and local ""get it done"" attitude among local populace.  <br/>Disadvantages about this location are distance to any form of infrastructure (healthcare, shipping, energy, retail, clean water, etc), higher temperatures compared to northern growing areas, limited growing space, and no skiing is available.  <br/>Thanks to the KHRG for allowing this map to be used.  Their website can be found at <a href=""http://www.khrg.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.khrg.org</a>.  <br/><br/><b>The Timeline<br/></b>The project is planned to start in mid November of 2015.  Much of the beginning should involve negotiation that will pave the way for future ventures.  Purchasing of equipment and certain supplies would occur at this time as well.  December would be excellent time for clearing operations as this is the dry season with cooler temperatures.  This should continue through to February 2016.  March should be a good time to work on using a tractor to scape the land.  Since land has been previously farmed this should not be to difficult.  May and June will be time for planting starts and tilling the ground.  July will be the month for cycling the flooding of the paddies.  Rice should grow steadily into August.  With a final harvest time of September.  If this seems rough, that is because the schedule is very rough.  <br/><br/><b>The Budget</b><br/>An expected minimum of expenses for the Test Project fits into four categories; tools/machinery, travel, lodging, and technology.  <br/>Tools/machinery   $7,250.25<br/>Travel                        $2,795.71<br/>Lodging                    $1,315.29<br/>Technology             $1,790.00<br/>Total trip                $13,151.25<br/>Perk items              $1,643.91<br/>Project Total         $14,795.16<br/>The requested amount is $15,000 to provide a slight buffer for unexpected costs.  <br/><br/><b>The Techniques</b><br/>What needs to be tested?  Things we will focus on testing or answering are communications, shipping/transportation, and modernized farming.  This a very remote location that does not have infrastructure.  We need to use actual methods of communication to accomplish a task.  While use of a BEGAN satilite transmitter maybe an effective way of communicating from this type of location, it costs too much to operate.  Talking over ideas on communication has sounded great in the past but we need to work out reliable systems to communicate back and forth.  <br/>Shipping/transportation is difficult in a remote location.  That is part of the definition of a remote location.  We aim to create systematic processes for shipping goods and transporting people

entails the use of farm machinery and application of the system of rice intensification.  Most hilltribe farmers do not use machinery as it is expensive to purchase and operate.  When asked if they would use machinery if they could access it most answered ""yes"".  System of rice intensification is a method of planting rice differing from regular or traditional ways of planting.  It varies from region to region but follows 5 primary elements.  Those 5 elements are careful leveling/scaping of the rice field, early planting of single seedlings at wider intervals, moistening soil instead of saturating, regular weeding and tilling, and use of organic fertilizers.  Check out the information from Cornell University about this methodology (<a href=""http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/methods/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sri.ciifad.cornell.edu/aboutsri/methods/index.html</a>).  <br/><br/>I wanted to get this announcement open and will post more information about the project as we go.  <p></p></div>","The ShortDo you know about conflict in Myanmar/Burma?  Good news!  There is a cease fire in place!  We should take advantage of the cease fire and move forward to a better situation for others.  We aim to stengthen the economic situation of people in Myanmar/Burma through developing an agriculture business, but we need to work out the details.  This project is to test what options will work and how do we make things work.  We want to create business for people to earn and bring money into the area, and we will need to test these business ideas out.  Agriculture development, farmers who have been subsistence farmers want to grow more, enough to sell.  We want to test ideas out on how to make that happen.  Will option A or option B work?  I am a veteran who after finishing school fled to hide at Missoula valley in the mountains.  As part of my time in Thailand, I worked with Design and Eliyah.  These men are involved with education and medical treatment with refugees.  We want to create a business partnership working with local farms to modernized farming techniques and increase selling power.  We will test this out on a farming site and use the test site to make food for workers at health clinics.  From what we learn we can move forward to creating business for farmers.  The PlanSince conflict has happened farming land still lays fallow.  Plots of this land belong to certain families.  Working with a family we would clear, plant a plot of land, and give the rice to local health clinic workers.  The land would be cleared using a chain saw, weed trimmer, and tractor, slightly different from the traditional slash and burn technique.  A transplanter would be used for planting as opposed to the traditional broadcasting method.  Transplanting has higher efficiency in labour and seed usage.  The crop would be harvested with a combine, and processed with drying racks.  Tradition is not entirely a bad thing as modern techniques in neighboring areas have created problems with dependency on fertilizers and pesticides.  I do not need my farmers twitching and alternates will have to be worked out.  This project is work and involves much coordination.  The LocationThe project will occur in Dooplaya District, Karen State of Myanmar.  Why there?  They asked for it.  And this location is far enough from urban locations to avoid rapid shifts in political unrest.  In conversations with people in this area, the topic of funding came up as it often does.  Recommendations were made for making business instead always seeking donations.  These people want to be entrepreneurs but need the help to get started.  While I am asking for donations now, it is a move to avoid donations later.  Advantages with this location include ready work force, limited military attention (KNU headquarters is located in the North), 1-2 day journey to almost all needed parts of the supply chain, local approval/request, witnessed coordination between different political organizations, distance from the ocean to limit storm effects, and local ""get it done"" attitude among local populace.  Disadvantages about this location are distance to any form of infrastructure (healthcare, shipping, energy, retail, clean water, etc), higher temperatures compared to northern growing areas, limited growing space, and no skiing is available.  Thanks to the KHRG for allowing this map to be used.  Their website can be found at www.khrg.org.  The TimelineThe project is planned to start in mid November of 2015.  Much of the beginning should involve negotiation that will pave the way for future ventures.  Purchasing of equipment and certain supplies would occur at this time as well.  December would be excellent time for clearing operations as this is the dry season with cooler temperatures.  This should continue through to February 2016.  March should be a good time to work on using a tractor to scape the land.  Since land has been previously farmed this should not be to difficult.  May and June will be time for planting starts and tilling the ground.  July will be the month for cycling the flooding of the paddies.  Rice should grow steadily into August.  With a final harvest time of September.  If this seems rough, that is because the schedule is very rough.  The BudgetAn expected minimum of expenses for the Test Project fits into four categories; tools/machinery, travel, lodging, and technology.  Tools/machinery   $7,250.25Travel                        $2,795.71Lodging                    $1,315.29Technology             $1,790.00Total trip                $13,151.25Perk items              $1,643.91Project Total         $14,795.16The requested amount is $15,000 to provide a slight buffer for unexpected costs.  The TechniquesWhat needs to be tested?  Things we will focus on testing or answering are communications, shipping/transportation, and modernized farming.  This a very remote location that does not have infrastructure.  We need to use actual methods of communication to accomplish a task.  While use of a BEGAN satilite transmitter maybe an effective way of communicating from this type of location, it costs too much to operate.  Talking over ideas on communication has sounded great in the past but we need to work out reliable systems to communicate back and forth.  Shipping/transportation is difficult in a remote location.  That is part of the definition of a remote location.  We aim to create systematic processes for shipping goods and transporting people to and from locations.  While this may sound simple to most people, a location with limited access and a history of violence it is a lot of work.  We will work this out.  Modernized farming entails the use of farm machinery and application of the system of rice intensification.  Most hilltribe farmers do not use machinery as it is expensive to purchase and

<p>We are the Youth Ministry of St Ignatius Church, Kelana

facilitate the very first Youth Rally, a youth camp for those aged 13-17 from
the local parish. Since then, we have trained about 20 young people every year
to be facilitators for the Youth Rally, who outreach to the young people at the
rally through the use of drama, dance, song and other methods. At the same
time, we build them up as young leaders of the church and mold them to be
strong characters with their foundation in Christ and the teachings of the
Catholic Church. Next year, we are going to send about 30 pilgrims to World
Youth Day, which is held in Krakow, Poland.</p>
<p>Briefly, World Youth Day is the single biggest gathering of
Catholic Youths from around the world. There will be many activities during
that time such as sharing from different youth groups, talks from international
speakers, catechism from various religious and speakers, musical concerts from
renowned Christian bands and also we get to meet the Holy Father, Pope Francis.
This will be an amazing experience for the pilgrims who are going and we want
to bring something back to share with the Youth Ministry. </p>

Unfortunately 95% of our oceans remain unexplored, and we plan to slowly change that through citizen science. By funding our private ROV, you are contributing to the exploration of the coastal waters of the Northern US (an area that larger science foundations have not thoroughly mapped).  The Bigger Picture:Project Sentinel will involve and stimulate the public's scientific interest. We hope to revive and improve the citizen science movement, where everyday people can perform experiments and exploration to produce data and results. By bringing research back into the public domain, the scientific community will diversify and grow!What we need for the ROV:  The $3000 needed for this project will go towards the following:  $1500 for 6 deep water thrusters (to control the vehicle)$500 for various circuit components  $1000 for surface control equipment and camerasNote: A project like this that only requires $3000 is an amazing opportunity, as some ROVs cost hundreds of thousands or more***  How you can help:  Share this project with your friends and families and contribute if you can!

<br/>Sweden has always been well know to the rest of the world as a progressive, forward nation, bound to protect human rights and fight injustice on all aspects of life. Yet, Sweden harbours one of the most repressive and destructive drug policies in the Western world. With that comes a stigma and an entire society that is brainwashed into ""Reefer Madness"" maners and also ignorantly proud of their lack of knowledge when it comes to drugs. <br/><br/>Cannabis is still considered a slippery slope to heroine addiction in Sweden and even with harsh fines and potential prison time for soft drugs, such as cannabis,  Sweden still has roughly 500 drug related deaths annually and a current spice (synthetic cannabis) epidemic. A direct result of the Swedish criminalization of cannabis.<br/><br/>Sweden, a nation of 9,5 million inhabitants has roughly the same amount of heroin addicts as The Netherlands (ca, 17 million), even though The Netherlands has one of the more liberal drug laws in the world. How is that possible?<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FbMjK-lHTj7s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbMjK-lHTj7s&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FbMjK-lHTj7s%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>Wally Johnson is hoping to do with <i>Mary &amp; I</i>, what <b>Adam Scorgie </b>did with award winning<b> </b><i>The Union </i>and the critically acclaimed <i>The Culture High . <br/></i><br/>As part of<i> Mary &amp; I</i>, Wally received the honour of flying Adam Scorgie over to screen his movie in Malmö, Sweden April 19th, 2015.

</div></div>","THE FUNDRAISER WAS SUCCESSFUL, BUT NOT THROUGH INDIEGOGO. WE RECEIVED A PRIVATE CONTRIBUTION OF 100 000 SEK FROM A DONOR THAT WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS.WE THANK EVERYONE THAT MADE THIS EVENT A GREAT ONE AND FIRST OF IT'S KIND

Cannabis.se | Svenska premiären av The Culture High Swedish screening of The Culture High with special guest Adam Scorgie + ongoing fundraiser for ""Mary & I""
 Wally Johnson is a Swedish comedian, actor/film maker and cannabis activist that decided to make a first of it's kind documentary on the impact the criminalization of cannabis has had on Swedish society. 



Sweden has always been well know to the rest of the world as a progressive, forward nation, bound to protect human rights and fight injustice on all aspects of life. Yet, Sweden harbours one of the most repressive and destructive drug policies in the Western world. With that comes a stigma and an entire society that is brainwashed into ""Reefer Madness"" maners and also ignorantly proud of their lack of knowledge when it comes to drugs. Cannabis is still considered a slippery slope to heroine addiction in Sweden and even with harsh fines and potential prison time for soft drugs, such as cannabis,  Sweden still has roughly 500 drug related deaths annually and a current spice (synthetic cannabis) epidemic. A direct result of the Swedish criminalization of cannabis.Sweden, a nation of 9,5 million inhabitants has roughly the same amount of heroin addicts as The Netherlands (ca, 17 million), even though The Netherlands has one of the more liberal drug laws in the world. How is that possible?Wally Johnson is hoping to do with Mary & I, what Adam Scorgie did with award winning The Union and the critically acclaimed The Culture High . As part of Mary & I, Wally received the honour of flying Adam Scorgie over to screen his movie in Malmö, Sweden April 19th, 2015. This is an exclusive visit that will be part of Wally's documentary to raise awareness of the effects prohibition has had on Sweden. The event will be open for everyone to attend, though seats will be limited.""Mary & I "" go to World Cannabis Conferences Indiegogo campaignAs explained in Wally's previous (and successful) fundraiser, because of the stigma cannabis has in Swedish society, Wally has not been able to find any traditional funding for Mary & I. Institutions finding loop holes to not support ""A Hippie project"" and production companies loving the idea, but being afraid to lose future gigs because of affiliation with a ""weed movie"". So far the documentary has been sponsored merely by Wally's own funds and now recently, the successful Indiegogo fundraiser. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, Wally decided to take a page out of Scorgie's book and also make a fund raiser. Wally is once again, humbly, seeking your support to keep pushing this documentary forward. 
Your support is incredibly valuable to us! <3

By donating to this cause, you will be directly responsible of funding two very important aspects of this project.
                      

Out of the $8000, roughly $5000 will go towards securing  Adam Scorgie's visit, Q&A and screening of The Culture High. That includes travel & accommodation for Adam to Malmö from Calgary. That also includes us renting a theater that can host 100-200 people. Equipment + staff so we can record and live stream the event. Of course, part of those funds will go towards travel and accommodation for our other guests that will be attending the panel discussion. Moderator: Ehsan Noroozi, (journalist, Stora Radiopriset)

<br/><p>Hello everyone, <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My name is Kevin Anglade. I am the Founder/CEO of a small publishing press called Flowered Concrete. As a publisher, we release and publish the works of many up-and-coming authors (including myself) that write in many various genres such as mystery, thriller, drama, detective fiction, graphic novelty and many, many more! <br/></p>
<p>The reason behind this campaign is to provide the opportunity for my fellow team members and myself to make an appearance at the book festival which will be the first inaugural festival of its kind in the borough of Queens which already has a diverse population and as well as a vibrant multi-cultural presence.</p>
<p>To those of you that are able to contribute to this campaign, you would be helping out in an enormous kind of way. <br/></p>
<p>Firstly, your financial assistance would allow us the great opportunity in exhibiting at the book festival. <br/></p>
<p>Secondly, it would allow us to showcase our company and as well as make book lovers aware of our Flowered Concrete brand.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that I have learned while upstarting and running this company over the past three years is that building a fan base or an awareness for a brand is hard, and so, I honestly feel as if with the help of you guys, you can help us get there by giving us that extra push that we so desperately need. The most important aspect of our publishing press is that we are attempting to not only entertain and captivate the minds of our potential readers, but it is also our greatest of hopes that we will educate them as well. Basically, Flowered Concrete is trying to change young lives with literature one human being at a time and so what better way in getting there by possibly having a chance in attending the first ever Queens Book Festival at Citi Field in New York City?!!</p>
<p>Find us online at <a href=""http://www.floweredconcrete.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.floweredconcrete.net</a> for more info on who we are and what we do as a small publishing press. If you aren't sure then, you can also visit our blog at <a href=""http://www.floweredconcrete.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.floweredconcrete.com</a> <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>For this festival, we need $1,000 dollars in order to find ourselves as participating exhibitors at this event. First and foremost, $750 of the dollars earned will be allocated to our event registration fees which includes: <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>One (1) 10 x 10 E-Z UP White Tent<br/><br/>One (1) Table: 8' Banquet (30""x96"") (without linen) w/ 2 Chairs<br/><br/>Secondly, $200 dollars will go towards the creation and printing of a booth banner with company logo and as well as I.D. passes for me and my fellow team members.<br/><br/>Lastly, the final $50 dollars will go towards our parking fees/passes for the day. Although we are a small publisher, we plan on bringing our fair share of books to the book festival, therefore, it is imperative that we are able to have reserved parking in order for us to carry our loads of promotional materials to this event.<br/><br/><ul><li>Everyone that participates and makes any sort of contribution (whether big or small) will be receiving signed free copies of our books throughout the remainder of the year. One of our authors by the name of Kevin Eleven will be releasing his second detective fiction novel (currently untitled) this summer in July, therefore, what better way to show our thanks during our book launch than to provide you all with autographed copies of his new book for FREE?! <br/>
</li></ul>
<br/><ul>
<li>Also, everyone who contributes will also be sent free downloads of short-stories and other bonuses courtesy of Flowered Concrete and in December, our very own Alton Taylor is releasing a noir crime-thriller of his own called ""Yelloworld"". Therefore, to wrap up the year, everyone that participates in this fundraising campaign, will also receive free e-book copies of that novel as WELL!!!<br/>
</li>
<br/> <li>Now there is a great possibility that we may find ourselves unable to reach our goal and if we don't, the $1,000 of funds provided by you all will still be put towards the book festival and the remainder of what's needed will be split in four equal ways between me and my remaining team members:</li>
</ul>Kevin Anglade (Me) (Founder/CEO/Publisher)<br/>Mia Hill (Public Relations/Media)<br/>Alton Taylor (Lead Art Director)<br/>Roy Diaz (Videographer)<br/>
<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>We feel as if this project is valuable towards you, the contributor and as well as the world because it is important to sustain and grow healthy readers/thinkers that will one day grow up to help leave the world in a much better way than which it was found. <br/>
</li>
<li>Through literacy and cultivating imagination, readers will be able to succeed in life as they realize their actual potential while reaching for greatness in whatever it is that moves them within their daily lives. Therefore, it can only happen if we all pitch in for this to actually come into fruition.<br/>
</li> <br/><li>We know that many may view this campaign as a plea for money that will aid in sparking a ""big break"" or a big-time gimmick in seeking attention for quick changed fame, however, this is most certainly NOT the case!!! Flowered Concrete (the name of our publishing press) is a metaphor within itself. The name equates to growing literature one rose at a time. The ""rose"" that we are speaking of metaphorically is YOU, the human being. Therefore, for any and everyone that is exposed to our literature, we are growing literature, expanding minds and also changing the world one reader (human being) at a time.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>There is a possibility that we may face obstacles and challenges along the way. For example, there is a strong chance in that we are able to attend the book festival and somehow it does not end up being the success that we thought it could be. <br/>
</li>
<li>For example, people may not want to engage themselves in conversation with us or they may find us flat-out uninteresting and boring (although here at Flowered Concrete, we are ANYTHING BUT BORING!! Check out our YouTube channel to see for yourselves).</li>
<li> Also, there is a possibility that we may not be able to make money off of our materials (books, posters, artworks). However, what qualifies us to overcome these hurdles is that we have hosted other events in which we've sold our books or partook in showcases that allowed us to sell our books and as well as pitched our brand. However, those did not work to our favor as we would have hoped they would. <br/>
</li>
<li>Therefore, going forward, we plan on solving and overcoming these past hurdles by being in attendance at the book festival itself!!! If there is one thing that I can say about our past trials and attempts at attending fairs or festivals is that we have never sold or appeared in any place as prestigious as an ACTUAL book festival!! Also, the attendance of families with teens and kids is perfect for our company as the youth are our target audience. If there is one thing that I can definitely say is that we have never gotten the chance to display our works in front of youth, therefore, the Queens Book Festival would be a great attempt at exhibiting an succeeding!!<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>For those of you that can't make a monetary contribution, just even spreading the word about this campaign would mean so much to us!<br/>
</li> <li>Also, if you think our campaign is worthy enough of a possible contribution, please be sure to use the sharing tools on our campaign's page and as well as this site in order to increase the awareness of the campaign itself. The Queens Book Festival takes place on Saturday, June 20th, 2015, and we are hoping that you all will partake in helping us get there.</li> </ul>

Although we are a small publisher, we plan on bringing our fair share of books to the book festival, therefore, it is imperative that we are able to have reserved parking in order for us to carry our loads of promotional materials to this event.Everyone that participates and makes any sort of contribution (whether big or small) will be receiving signed free copies of our books throughout the remainder of the year. One of our authors by the name of Kevin Eleven will be releasing his second detective fiction novel (currently untitled) this summer in July, therefore, what better way to show our thanks during our book launch than to provide you all with autographed copies of his new book for FREE?! 


Also, everyone who contributes will also be sent free downloads of short-stories and other bonuses courtesy of Flowered Concrete and in December, our very own Alton Taylor is releasing a noir crime-thriller of his own called ""Yelloworld"". Therefore, to wrap up the year, everyone that participates in this fundraising campaign, will also receive free e-book copies of that novel as WELL!!!

 Now there is a great possibility that we may find ourselves unable to reach our goal and if we don't, the $1,000 of funds provided by you all will still be put towards the book festival and the remainder of what's needed will be split in four equal ways between me and my remaining team members:
Kevin Anglade (Me) (Founder/CEO/Publisher)Mia Hill (Public Relations/Media)Alton Taylor (Lead Art Director)Roy Diaz (Videographer)
   The Impact   We feel as if this project is valuable towards you, the contributor and as well as the world because it is important to sustain and grow healthy readers/thinkers that will one day grow up to help leave the world in a much better way than which it was found. 

Through literacy and cultivating imagination, readers will be able to succeed in life as they realize their actual potential while reaching for greatness in whatever it is that moves them within their daily lives. Therefore, it can only happen if we all pitch in for this to actually come into fruition.
 We know that many may view this campaign as a plea for money that will aid in sparking a ""big break"" or a big-time gimmick in seeking attention for quick changed fame, however, this is most certainly NOT the case!!! Flowered Concrete (the name of our publishing press) is a metaphor within itself. The name equates to growing literature one rose at a time. The ""rose"" that we are speaking of metaphorically is YOU, the human being. Therefore, for any and everyone that is exposed to our literature, we are growing literature, expanding minds and also changing the world one reader (human being) at a time.
    Risks & Challenges 
There is a possibility that we may face obstacles and challenges along the way. For example, there is a strong chance in that we are able to attend the book festival and somehow it does not end up being the success that we thought it could be. 

For example, people may not want to engage themselves in conversation with us or they may find us flat-out uninteresting and boring (although here at Flowered Concrete, we are ANYTHING BUT BORING!! Check out our YouTube channel to see for yourselves).
 Also, there is a possibility that we may not be able to make money off of our materials (books, posters, artworks). However, what qualifies us to overcome these hurdles is that we have hosted other events in which we've sold our books or partook in showcases that allowed us to sell our books and as well as pitched our brand. However, those did not work to our favor as we would have hoped they would. 

Therefore, going forward, we plan on solving and overcoming these past hurdles by being in attendance at the book festival itself!!! If there is one thing that I can say about our past trials and attempts at attending fairs or festivals is that we have never sold or appeared in any place as prestigious as an ACTUAL book festival!! Also, the attendance of families with teens and kids is perfect for our company as the youth are our target audience. If there is one thing that I can definitely say is that we have never gotten the chance to display our works in front of youth, therefore, the Queens Book Festival would be a great attempt at exhibiting an succeeding!!
    Other Ways You Can Help

For those of you that can't make a monetary contribution, just even spreading the word about this campaign would mean so much to us!
 Also, if you think our campaign is worthy enough of a possible contribution, please be sure to use the sharing tools on our campaign's page and as well as this site in order to increase the awareness of the campaign itself. The Queens Book Festival takes place on Saturday, June 20th, 2015, and we are hoping that you all will partake in helping us get there.

only 2 weeks since the massive 7.8 Richter scale earthquake hit Nepal, the area
was jolted by another devastating M 7.3 quake east of Kathmandu. One of the
hardest hit is the Kavre district, located close to the capital city of Kathmandu.
The first deadly Himalayan earthquake took more than 8000 lives, and the death
toll is still increasing. Thousands have been injured resulting loss of their

has made but to especially conduct an effort towards rebuilding remote public
schools.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to
raise adequate donation for rebuild the two Public School (from where we
graduated) in Hokse Bazar which is completely demolished due to massive
earthquake. Hokse is a small village in Kavrepalanchok, Nepal located in 51KM
(32 Miles) East of Kathmandu Valley (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokse_Bazar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokse_Bazar</a>). More than 1,500 students are affected due
to the aftermath created by the earthquake. The currently planned fiscal goal
is not adequate to reestablish the infrastructure completely, therefore we
believe it may light up the spirit of the poor children, teachers and their
parents. A small contribution can also play a vital role in a big situation
like this. An achievement of further smaller goals can be a greatest attempt in
accomplishing the bigger goal.</p>

its way, all the earthquake victims currently enduring on the street must walk
through a very challenging situation.</p>
<p>Since the first
earthquake struck, we have been aiding the community disaster management team
in our village to provide an immediate relief.  At this point we truly
believe it is time to start the rebuilding process. The public school is one of
the area which needs to be addressed soon. If not large number of students will
be out of school without proper education. </p>

<div>Reading proficiency is an essential skill for success in the 21st Century. Children spend their first few years of school learning to read and around 3rd grade, students begin reading to learn. Students who are not proficient in reading by 4th grade struggle academically and are much less likely to graduate from high school. </div>

<h2></h2>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>A disproportionately high percentage of black children live in<b> book deserts</b>, where libraries, bookstores, and reading material at home are scarce. In some poverty stricken communities there are as few as<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-susan-neuman/opportunity-gap-or-knowle_b_1907750.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> one age appropriate book for every 300 children.</a></p>

Adding to these challenges, many early childhood classrooms do not incorporate black boys' reading preferences and too few teachers are responsive to young black boys' individual learning needs.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.ed.gov/news/media-advisories/us-secretary-education-duncan-and-film-producer-spike-lee-call-morehouse-students-pursue-teaching-careers"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Far too many black men are missing during the critical period for reading acquisition (pre-K to grade 3). <a href=""https://www.ed.gov/news/media-advisories/us-secretary-education-duncan-and-film-producer-spike-lee-call-morehouse-students-pursue-teaching-careers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Less than 2% of U.S. teachers are black males </a>and<a href=""https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-570.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a majority of black boys live with single-mothers</a><a href=""https://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-570.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>.  Black men’s absence from black boys' early reading experiences is significant. Recent<a href=""http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Files/PDF/Topics/Gender%20and%20Racial%20Fairness/IB_Strategies_033012.ashx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> social psychology research </a>demonstrates that encouragement and modeling from relevant same-sex role models can improve a one's attitude, perceptions, and confidence.  </p>
<p><b>Young black boys' current reading attitudes, behavior, or ability are not fixed, but malleable and highly susceptible to positive influences - Barbershop Books is proof.</b></p><p></p>
<h2>An Innovative Solution 

</h2>
<div>Barbershop Books is a community-based literacy program that creates child-friendly reading spaces in barbershops for boys ages 4-8. This innovative program works to improve boys' <b>access to engaging books</b> and increase the <b>amount of time boys read for fun</b>. <br/>
</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430769844/iesqvonx1yiui9wix0hz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Unlike literacy programs based in schools, libraries, or community organizations, Barbershops Books brings children’s books into a male centered environment. It connects barbers and parents to the early reading experiences of young boys in a positive and culturally meaningful way. Currently, we have reading spaces in  <a href=""http://barbershopbooks.org/barbershopbooks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">six NYC barbershops</a>, reaching more than 240 boys annually.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1428063/files/20150430011412-Levels_Barbershop-186.jpg?1430381652"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A window decal at the entrance of participating barbershops reminds patrons about the children's books inside. Each reading space includes a colorful 2 ft by 2ft book sling filled with <a href=""http://readingholidayproject.org/books/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://barbershopbooks.org/books/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">15 curated titles </a>that appeal to boys, especially reluctant readers. The book sling is prominently displayed near a seating area and in large shops, the reading space includes a small bright-yellow chair.  The books used for the program change annually and  target boys ages 4 to 8 for two main reasons: (1) this age range represents a <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528655/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">critical period for reading acquisition</a> and (2) barbershop observations revealed that young boys are most likely to engage with books in a barbershop setting. Older boys and men are usually on cell phones, watching TV, or talking to other guys in the shop. </p>

<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<p>One day<a href=""https://twitter.com/AlvinIrby"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://barbershopbooks.org/about/founder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Alvin Irby</a><a href=""https://twitter.com/AlvinIrby"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, the creator of Barbershop Books, was getting a haircut in a barbershop across the street from<a href=""http://www.ps69bronx.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> PS 69</a><a href=""http://www.ps69bronx.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, the elementary school in the Bronx where Mr. Irby taught 1st grade. A few minutes into his haircut, one of his 1st graders walked into the barbershop and plopped down on a sofa. The 7-year-old boy stared out the barbershop's large window for 10 minutes with a bored look on his face and then he began running around the shop. As he watched the boy's antsy behavior, Mr. Irby thought to himself, “He really should be practicing his reading right now. I wish I had a children's book with me for him to read.” It was at this moment back in the spring of 2009 that the idea for Barbershop Books was born.</p>

<h2>Measuring Program Outcomes</h2>
<p>Initially, Barbershop Books will track the number of reading spaces we create annually in barbershops to determine how our program is impacting black boys' access to age-appropriate books. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Once we secure additional funding, we will
develop a Barbershop Books mobile app that gamifies reading for boys,
making it fun and competitive. This innovative app will incentivize children to engage with books and allow them to digitally track the books they read. Interested mobile app and game developers, coders, or software engineers, please <a href=""http://readingholidayproject.org/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://barbershopbooks.org/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact us </a>to get involved. </p><p>The Barbershop
Books app will produce actionable data about boys' book preferences and
reading behavior that will help us to continually improve our program. </p><p><br/></p><h1>

More than 85% of black male 4th graders in the United States are not reading on grade level.
Reading proficiency is an essential skill for success in the 21st Century. Children spend their first few years of school learning to read and around 3rd grade, students begin reading to learn. Students who are not proficient in reading by 4th grade struggle academically and are much less likely to graduate from high school. 



The Challenge
A disproportionately high percentage of black children live in book deserts, where libraries, bookstores, and reading material at home are scarce. In some poverty stricken communities there are as few as one age appropriate book for every 300 children.
Few diverse books are published each year that reflect the culture and reading interests of African American children, especially boys. Adding to these challenges, many early childhood classrooms do not incorporate black boys' reading preferences and too few teachers are responsive to young black boys' individual learning needs.
Far too many black men are missing during the critical period for reading acquisition (pre-K to grade 3). Less than 2% of U.S. teachers are black males and a majority of black boys live with single-mothers.  Black men’s absence from black boys' early reading experiences is significant. Recent social psychology research demonstrates that encouragement and modeling from relevant same-sex role models can improve a one's attitude, perceptions, and confidence.  
Young black boys' current reading attitudes, behavior, or ability are not fixed, but malleable and highly susceptible to positive influences - Barbershop Books is proof.
An Innovative Solution 


Barbershop Books is a community-based literacy program that creates child-friendly reading spaces in barbershops for boys ages 4-8. This innovative program works to improve boys' access to engaging books and increase the amount of time boys read for fun. 


Unlike literacy programs based in schools, libraries, or community organizations, Barbershops Books brings children’s books into a male centered environment. It connects barbers and parents to the early reading experiences of young boys in a positive and culturally meaningful way. Currently, we have reading spaces in  six NYC barbershops, reaching more than 240 boys annually.


A window decal at the entrance of participating barbershops reminds patrons about the children's books inside. Each reading space includes a colorful 2 ft by 2ft book sling filled with 15 curated titles that appeal to boys, especially reluctant readers. The book sling is prominently displayed near a seating area and in large shops, the reading space includes a small bright-yellow chair.  The books used for the program change annually and  target boys ages 4 to 8 for two main reasons: (1) this age range represents a critical period for reading acquisition and (2) barbershop observations revealed that young boys are most likely to engage with books in a barbershop setting. Older boys and men are usually on cell phones, watching TV, or talking to other guys in the shop.

The Impact






Easy access to reading materials, regardless of children’s reading ability, increases the amount of time children read for fun. This campaign will help create 100 reading spaces in barbershop across America this year. Making culturally relevant, age appropriate, and gender responsive books easily accessible for black boys has an immediate positive impact on their reading behavior (boys read in the barbershop for 10-30 minutes while they wait for a haircut). Research from the U.S. Department of Education shows that students who read for fun once or twice a month have significantly higher reading scores than students who never or hardly ever read for fun. The one to two trips that many young black boys make to the barbershop each month can lead to significant reading gains. 

Origin Story

One day  Alvin Irby, the creator of Barbershop Books, was getting a haircut in a barbershop across the street from PS 69, the elementary school in the Bronx where Mr. Irby taught 1st grade. A few minutes into his haircut, one of his 1st graders walked into the barbershop and plopped down on a sofa. The 7-year-old boy stared out the barbershop's large window for 10 minutes with a bored look on his face and then he began running around the shop. As he watched the boy's antsy behavior, Mr. Irby thought to himself, “He really should be practicing his reading right now. I wish I had a children's book with me for him to read.” It was at this moment back in the spring of 2009 that the idea for Barbershop Books was born.
How Will Your Donation Be Used?
Your donation will help Barbershop Books create the inventory we need to distribute 100 reading spaces to barbershops, reaching approximately 4,000 boys. 

6000 engaging children's books (initial book set + replacement books)
100 colorful book slings
100 large Barbershop Books posters
100 Barbershop Books window decals
Packaging (outside NYC)
Shipping (outside NYC)

We will select barbershops in NYC and in other U.S. cities throughout the United States in which to implement Barbershop Books this year. Please visit our website to recommend barbershops in your community. 

$100,000 Stretch Goal
Once we reach $100,000, we will be able to distribute 200 reading spaces to barbershops, reaching approximately 8000 boys.  
What We Need to Scale Nationally 





Measuring Program Outcomes
Initially, Barbershop Books will track the number of reading spaces we create annually in barbershops to determine how our program is impacting black boys' access to age-appropriate books. 


Once we secure additional funding, we will
develop a Barbershop Books mobile app that gamifies reading for boys,
making it fun and competitive. This innovative app will incentivize children to engage with books and allow them to digitally track the books they read. Interested mobile app and game developers, coders, or software engineers, please contact us to get involved. The Barbershop
Books app will produce actionable data about boys' book preferences and
reading behavior that will help us to continually improve our program.

<p>Our aim is to be able to offer full scholarships to all institute participants. Women who dedicate their lives to defending the rights of others often face significant daily adversity that affects their mental, spiritual and physical well-being.

This is particularly true for those from historically discriminated groups, such as the Indigenous peoples of Canada. We do not want finances to be a barrier to attending this important course that is impacting women's lives around the world . That is why we wish to generate enough money to offer funding to all of the participants for the 2015 institutes, and to support the sustainability of the WHRI moving forward. </p>
<p>You can help us achieve that goal by contributing towards a general scholarship pool or by offering a scholarship in your name, or in the name of a person of your choosing, for either the full WHRI Intensive of for the CEDAW for Change Institute.  </p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the costs of funding a participant scholarship:</p>

<p><b>CEDAW for Change Institute</b><br/>Partial Scholarship: $1,000<br/>Full Scholarship: $3,000</p>

 (Traducción española sigue)
The Women's Human Rights Education Institute (WHRI) was co-founded by internationally renowned Costa Rican feminist jurist and Expert Member of the UN Working Group on Discrimination Against Women in Law and Practice, Alda Facio, and University of Toronto/OISE Professor of Adult Education and Community Development, Angela Miles. The purpose of the institute is to  offer international human rights training programs that help women's human rights defenders from around the world develop a practical understanding of the UN Human Rights system, learn how to apply a women's human rights framework to a multiplicity of issues, and develop the facilitation skills necessary for them to become human rights educators in their own regions and organizations. 
El Instituto de Educación de Derechos Humanos
de la Mujer (WHRI) fue cofundado por Alda Facio, jurista feminista
costarricense, quien es internacionalmente reconocida, miembro experta del grupo
de trabajo de la ONU sobre la Discriminación contra la Mujer en la ley y en la
práctica. Y por Angela Miles, profesora del Instituto para Estudios de la
Educación de Ontario (OISE), Universidad de Toronto. El objetivo del Instituto es ofrecer programas
internacionales e formación en derechos humanos. Estos programas permiten que
los defensores de derechos humanos de las mujeres de todo el mundo logren
desarrollar una comprensión práctica del sistema de Derechos Humanos de la ONU,
aprender a aplicar el marco de los derechos humanos de las mujeres a una
multiplicidad de temáticas y desarrollar las habilidades necesarias para que se
conviertan en educadores de derechos humanos en sus propias regiones y
organizaciones.
Since 2004, more than 500 participants have enhanced their capacities as
 women's human rights defenders through the WHRI training programs, 
which include (Desde 2004, más de 500 participantes han

CEDAW for Change - A seven-day institute focused on the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of

Convention, examine case studies that have come before CEDAW, and 
strategize on how to link their work to that of the CEDAW committee and a
 women’s human rights education framework.

Issue</u></i></p>
<p>Across
much of the developing world, by the time she is 12, a girl
is tending to the house, cooking, cleaning and she is less likely to
be vaccinated, to see a doctor, or attend school, compared to her
male counterpart. Too often, a family values a daughter less than a
son, not seeing the benefits of educating her when they could just
have her work at home. The odds are constantly against her. 
</p>
<p><b>We’re
here to change that with your help. </b>
</p>
<p><i><u>Who
Are We?</u></i></p>
<p>We’re
FuzeUs! 
</p>
<p>FuzeUs
is a social-sharing and collaboration platform that works to deepen
the connections between nonprofits and the individuals (like you!)
and the communities that support them. We help you find, share and
care more about the good happening in the world by giving you the
platform and tools to turn your voices into action. 
</p>
<p>By
providing in-depth data and analytics to non-profits and
cause-marketing campaigns for corporations to truly understand their
audience and consumer base, we make sure every single dollar and
minute is being used with 100% efficiency and productivity. Our GOAL
is to change the world by turning philanthropy into a science, and
making DOING GOOD, fun, engaging and easy for everyone to do!</p>
<p><i><u>What’s
this Indiegogo Campaign for?</u></i></p>
<p>At
FuzeUs, we strongly believe that empowering
young women
and girls is a key step in breaking the cycle of poverty
and
gender inequality
around the world, and there’s no better way to accomplish that than
by giving more girls
the opportunity and the support so that they can go to AND stay in
school to
champion them to eventually become role models and great heroine!

</p>
<p>Gonzo
Soccer is a nonprofit that we’ve been working with for a while that
we think has the potential to really make a difference in the agenda
to
empower girls,
gender
equality, and leadership
but they need your help! That’s why we started this Indiegogo
campaign, to raise awareness on their cause and get them the support
they need. 
</p>
<p><i><u>Why
Should You Care? (Why Invest in Girls?) Part 2</u></i></p>
<p>70%
of the children NOT in school around the world are girls. That’s
about 65 million girls. Without education, girls are more likely to
marry young, have children early, and spend their life in poverty,
with
a lack of gender equality and leadership skills for their future.
Over 51 million adolescent
girls
between the ages of 15 and 19 are already married. Of course, younger
mothers
are at a much higher risk of complications during childbirth and
pregnancy and the lives of the mother and the child are in danger.  
</p>
<p>Just
by keeping them in school beyond 7<sup>th</sup>
grade, girls would be more likely to marry 4 years later and have an
average of 2.2 fewer children and send them to school, less likely to
die in pregnancy and
childbirth,
and more likely to have healthier children. AND when girls and women
earn income, they are likely to reinvest 90% of it into their
families. They buy books, medicine, and bed nets. For men, that
figure of reinvestment is only between 30-40%. 
</p>
<p><b>Despite
this truth, less than 2 cents of every development dollar goes to
girls…and roughly 9 of 10 youth programs are aimed at boys. </b>
</p>
<p>BUT
you can help turn the tide for
gender inequality.
Ultimately, you would be a
champion to help
Gonzo Soccer help these girls find their voices as young women and as
future leaders, and support their continuing education in
becoming the leadership of tomorrow.
By contributing what you can, YOU can help empower at-risk girls and
have a hand in turning them into strong women who can become
champions of their communities and
role models for future generations.</p>
<p><i><u>A
Little Bit about Gonzo Soccer</u></i></p>
<p>Gonzo
Soccer was founded by Monica Gonzalez, former captain of the Mexican
National Women's
Soccer team.
It is a year-round girls’ soccer and leadership academy for
underprivileged girls that began in the US in 2009, which has now
expanded to Mexico and 5 cities in Colombia.  The goal is to reach
more marginalized young women that are at risk of “falling through
the cracks.” 
</p>
<p>On
top of giving the girls elite soccer training by experienced and
dedicated coaches and
role models,
the academy also provides an hour-long session of tutoring and
academic counseling before or after training. In Mexico and Latin
America, they provide intensive English classes through a partnership
with the US Embassy. Gonzo also connects girls with scholarships to
attend private schools in hopes of eventually earning college
academic or athletic scholarships. 
</p>
<p>Lastly,
the academy provides valuable life skills training on topics such as
goal setting, team-building, leadership, body image, dangers of drugs
and alcohol use, bullying and violence in school, and forming good
habits. The academy even conducts seminars for parents to educate
them on themes like proper nutrition, study habits, exercise and
education so
that they can be the role models and heroes to empower these young
girls. 
</p>
<p><i><u>Why
we need YOU.</u></i></p>
<p>Today,
we’re trying to raise money for 35 Gonzo girls and several coaches
from their locations in Colombia, Mexico and the US, to Chicago for a
meet and greet with the Chicago Red Stars and then to a 5-day
leadership retreat this summer (2015) at a renowned summer camp in
Wisconsin. The funds will go to fees for the summer camp program,
travel (transportation) and insurance.</p>
<p>Show
the girls you care, and help us spread the word! (Even if you can’t
contribute!)</p>
<p><i><u>What
are you funding?</u></i></p>
<p>
At
the retreat, the girls and coaches will be able to partake in
intensive leadership meetings, special classes in a variety of topics
such as public speaking, conflict resolution, and ROPES courses led
by distinguished guests. They will also be attending a community
outreach workshop with bilingual mental health practitioners and
mentors who work with affected youth in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>The
girls will also have a “meet and greet” visit with the Chicago
Red Stars players where they will have a chance to talk with players
and coaches and meet great female role models. (such as US Olympic
Team midfielder Laurie Chalupny and Canadian National Team Captain
Karina LeBlanc). 
</p>
<p>Finally,
the girls will be invited to share in a celebration event with local
leaders, other youth and press to share about the program, Colombian
culture and experiences. 
</p>
<p>The
GOAL of the trip is not only to raise awareness and support for the
program and the concept of Sport for Social Change and women’s
empowerment through sport, but to show the girls a bigger horizon,
and meet more female role models so that they can begin thinking of
themselves as future leaders who can cross the boundaries of
countries and
be a champion for change. 
</p>
<p><i><u>What
if you can’t contribute?</u></i></p>
<p>Share
this campaign with as many of your friends as you can! Make a lot of
noise! Who doesn’t love soccer AND empowering young girls?? 
</p>
<p><i><u>What
do you get in return?</u></i></p>
<p>In
return for your contribution, you get warm and fuzzy feelings for
making a difference! (We promise, it feels like nothing else!)</p>
<p>Alright,
fine, fine, you get more than that for contributing. 
</p>
<p>Depending
on your contribution, you could see yourself wearing a Gonzo Soccer
branded T-shirt that we designed, some
of our great FuzeUs Do Goodies, and even qualify for our social good
clubs where you can get all sorts of great things. 
</p>

<p><i><u>You’re
Investing in THE Future</u></i></p>
<p>We
have to help girls realize their potential instead of seeing them as
dispensable or even worse, as prey. And by investing in girls’
education, society reaps the benefits from the skills she gains. It
is the first step in creating the next generation of leaders. They
are the key to breaking the cycle of poverty.  In fact, you could
even say that <b>investing
in a girl is investing in the future</b>.

</p>
<p><i><u>Why
Sports? Why Soccer? </u></i>
</p>
<p>Sports
is unifying. It can engage and bring the world together in a way only
very few things can manage. It can promote understanding, tolerance,
break down barriers and mobilize support for social causes. It is a
universal language. It can overcome prejudices of race, background
and gender. 
</p>
<p>It
has proven to encourage students to stay in school and parents to get
their children immunized. Today it is used effectively to promote
HIV/AIDS awareness and has even helped drive global campaigns against
child labor and landmines.</p>
<p><b>Most
importantly, sport is also providing role models for empowering girls
and women. The international success of female athletes are giving
young girls new heroines, challenging the norm and helping girls
recognize their own potential and ambitions. </b>
</p>
<p>Whether
people in the US like it or not, soccer is the most popular sport in
the world. You only need a ball and one other person to play after
all! This allows the sport of soccer to be a perfect tool for
diplomacy and opening avenues of dialogue on questions of culture and
politics. 
</p>
<p><b>Gonzo
Soccer is harnessing sports’ ability to be an agent of social
change, to help these girls become empowered individuals who can
shape their own community and the future for the better. </b>
</p>
<p><i><u>What
happens if we go below or above the goal?</u></i></p>
<p>If
we don’t reach the intended goal, the money will still go to fund
the Gonzo Soccer programs so that they can reach more girls and give
them a chance for a better education and future. 
</p>
<p>IF
we go above and beyond our goal, all extra funds will either go to
getting more girls to be able to attend the leadership retreat, or to
fund other exchange programs that the academy has planned for their
girls. 
</p>
<p>There’s
always other things to be paid for such as equipment, uniforms,
staffing and educational training costs that your help could fund!</p><p><br/></p><p>Here are the 4 choices of shirts you can choose from:</p><p>#1</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435589229/utcn8u8hsuqjtw6vbwvl.png"" src="""" style=""width: 317.190721649485px; height: 397px;""/></p><p>#2

<h4>Mystique Found Her Voice This Past Summer...</h4>

She astounded us by not only asking an insightful question that NBA legend Alonzo Mourning himself complimented her on, but by being the ONLY student in our group who did not have stage fright the day of the interview and instead, grabbed the mic and spoke her mind.

</div></div>","Journal Junkies is a nonprofit writing center based in Springfield, Massachusetts, dedicated to empowering high school youth to explore their journalistic lens. We help teenagers understand that everyone has a story to tell, and every story has a right to be heard, including their own. We are dedicated to instilling courage, compassion, and confidence in the young people we work with every day.               Who We Serve                                         
We have worked with a
wide range of high school students in Springfield, MA and its surrounding
communities. Students reflect the socioeconomic and multicultural
diversity within the Western, MA region. All of our programs will always be offered 100% free
to students, ensuring that those who need our services most – the students
who are least likely to have a voice in their community – can participate.

Our Innovative Program                         
We will enlist the
talent and support of local teachers, college students, fellow journalists and
community volunteers. At our impressive 9,000 square foot downtown writing
center in the heart of Springfield’s Tower Square, our 2015 students will have free after-school
workshops and open writing hours each week. We will be sharing our space with The Tech Foundry, a nonprofit organization
committed to working with students and residents to turn Western Massachusetts
into a tech hub for the Northeast.





In our weekly after school sessions, our goal is to help our students prepare for
and interview people ranging from community members to notable activists and
celebrities. Students have a complete say in the kinds of stories they’d like
to pursue. We also work with them to choose the type of media venue that is
right for them, whether that is audio story telling, photojournalism or
writing. All of our students’ work gets published on our blog and could also be publicized on local or national media outlets.

We are genuinely interested in listening to what our Journal Junkies have to say. We value their insights about their communities, their lives and the news they hear, watch, or read on their many mobile devices. We are never grading or judging. We are simply put, inspired by their voices and we think the rest of the world should hear them, too.





Interviews                                                  


During the summer of 2014, students interviewed a
wide range of folks from everyday people in their community, to NBA legend
Alonzo Mourning. With each interview, they learned that every person, no matter
who they are or where they come from, has a story to tell. 


Alonzo Mourning: When the students interviewed NBA
     legend Alonzo Mourning, they learned that if it weren’t for his foster
     mom, he never would have graduated from college or made it to the NBA.
     Several of the students from this summer’s program live in foster care.

Sarah Concannon: In interviewing
     Sarah, a local artist whose project “The People in Your Neighborhood” is
     on display at Springfield’s Wood Museum, the students learned that each of
     their city’s 17 communities has a unique voice. They also asked Sarah many
     questions about what it takes to persevere as a working artist.

Bhuwan Gautam: A former refugee from
     Bhutan who lived in a refugee camp for 16 years, Bhuwan came to the United
     States in 2008 and holds a B.A. from Western New England University. He
     resides in Springfield currently. The students asked him many questions
     about survival and what it has been like coming to the city as a refugee.

Our 2015 Blog
Will Feature:



 A recurring piece called “What’s that
     Junk?” Students will go out into the community and explore what appears to
     be a decrepit or abandoned building. Their job will be to find out the
     backstory, the life the buildings once had before they were forsaken.

Students will also write a feature series
     about a talented spray paint artist in Springfield whose work includes a
     large mural with the life size words: “What does it take to be a man?”

They will investigate a story in conjunction
     with our University of Massachusetts teacher volunteers about why the FDA
     is not disclosing certain information pertaining to a student research project.

</div> </div>","Hi there!

Have you ever wanted something really bad (at least as a kid)? And you were trying to get/earn/save money as fast and as much as you could so you could afford that ""something""? Do you still remember the moment when someone saw how hard you're trying and decided to help you in your endeavour?

We are first Croatian national Ultimate team and we know exactly how you feel!! 
We have a really big goal we want to achieve - to participate in European Ultimate (frisbee) Championship 2015. in Copenhagen, Denmark, at the end of July, and we would like YOU to be that ""someone special"" who will help us to get there.

If you are still wondering what the Ultimate (frisbee) is, here is some brief info:

the best team sport you can possibly imagine


limited-contact team field sport played with a flying disc


whole idea of Ultimate is based on honesty and respect among players





NO REFEREES! - all misunderstandings and disagreements are solved between players involved

points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone

a stunning feature of the Ultimate is the ""lay out"", a horizontal dive to catch or block the disc (which simply leaves spectators breathless)





What We Need & What You Get

Although there are several things and ways you can help our cause, the main thing we need to make our dream come true is money. As it is stated, we need 5000$ or more for (about 300€ per player for low budget stay): 



Transportation (minibus)
Sleeping (camp expenses)
Training (field and cones)
Equipment (jerseys and discs)


 If we don't reach our entire goal and have just part and decide not to go to EUC, we will use all collected money for developing youth ultimate!

that, we are introducing a graphic tee from our '<b>Made in the USA' </b>collection. For
every one of these shirts sold, $5 will be donated to a local nonprofit
organization that supports US Veterans. But we won’t stop there. We are working

</div></div>","Who We Are
Children Across America (CAA), a 501c3
nonprofit located in Milford, MA, is an organization dedicated to protecting
children against preventable illnesses and giving underserved kids an
opportunity to achieve academic excellence.

Since 2007, CAA has been working with local communities to
ensure children in low-income families receive preventative medical care and also gain literacy and leadership skills they need to succeed in school and in
life.Help us make
the DIFFERENCE in children's lives! Here's how you can support our campaign, to
contribute or to buy a t-shirt, please follow these steps:


If you would
like to fund our campaign and you don't want to shop, please select Contribute
on the right hand side of the campaign.


If you want
to buy a t-shirt, select a perk on the right hand side. If you would like to
buy more than 1 t-shirt, please select the perk more than 1 time.


From here
the page will lead you to provide your shipping information and payment
details.


For your
shipment you can pay via Paypal or your debit/credit card.


To choose a
t-shirt size and color, please check the available colors and sizes under the
t-shirt perks. Please let us know which color and size would you like to receive
by sending an email to jstgermain@childrenacrossamerica.org.


The t-shirts
will be on their way by October 1st.


Why We’re on Indiegogo
CAA is developing an innovative brand
of imprinted t-shirts. These
shirts will have people feeling new and Recharged! After delivering awesomely inspirational apparel, the
profits from the campaign will go towards funding programs that are uniquely
designed to empower children in communities across America.
Wait, wait, wait! It gets better!
Recharge branded t-shirts are 100% cotton and will be made and
screened right here in the USA. Aligning with the philosophies of CAA, much of the apparel
produced alongside this campaign will also benefit other organizations. To do
that, we are introducing a graphic tee from our 'Made in the USA' collection. For
every one of these shirts sold, $5 will be donated to a local nonprofit
organization that supports US Veterans. But we won’t stop there. We are working
on several other concepts that are designed to help other nonprofits too!









We recognize that as CAA, we cannot successfully achieve our mission without the support of local communities. That’s why we decided to behave with the golden rule in mind. Treat others the way you wanted to be treated.
The bottom line is that you are recharging your local community by participating in this campaign. You deserve pats on the back in perpetuity.



The Master Plan to Recharge Local Communities
We are trying to get our largest program up and running by Summer 2016, the Summer Lunch and Literacy Program (SLLP).For most of the children that receive free or reduced cost lunch during a school year, this is their most nutritious meal of the day. During the summer months, children are likely to go without this meal for 80 consecutive days.These same children, usually living with their parents, don’t usually understand the value of a proper education. They are not encouraged to read or practice math over the summer. As a result, when they return to school in September, they take twice as long to reach their previous literacy level from June. 








We have a program
that will solve that problem

The Recharge program is a major step in funding the SLLP and if you believe that this program is essential, then it’s time to do your best to support it.
The Recharge brand, established in 2015, designs clothes for people from all walks of life. If you are someone that appreciates putting on your favorite shirt for their favorite cause, then wow, you’re in the right place. Recharge believes that there are consumers out there that have a sense of pride knowing that their purchase is creating jobs in the USA. CAA is highly confident that people will back a brand that puts out great looking, feel-good inspirational wear. Not to mention that the majority of the proceeds go to supporting programs designed to empower people in need.

<b>Walter Prunzik</b>
</div><div>Hello my name is Walter Prunzik. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">On a recent visit to the rainforest of Ecuador, I came into contact with the Shuars, an indigenous tribe of some of the most beautiful people on Earth. The purpose of my visit was to do my own investigation into Ayahausca, also known as the Spirit Vine. The Spirit Vine has long been rumored to have many healing properties that the Western medical community does not recognize, healing such things as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, hyper and hypothyroidism, as well as repairing hearts, kidneys, livers, and any other damaged organs in the human body. I was introduced to a Shaman named Danielle. It didn't take me long to realize that I was in the presence of a very real and actual Shaman. It was only after Danielle felt comfortable with me that I was invited into his home and into his family. That is where this magical journey began and unfolded into a mystical once in a lifetime adventure of healing, friendship and love. </span>

<b>Danielle and his wife Maria with me </b></span></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Journey Begins</b></div><div>The days passed as I rested and Danielle appeared once again to inform me that he had decided to take me on as a patient and a student. We headed into the rain forest, stopping along the way to take pictures and rest. After a few miles of hiking a muddy trail deeper into the jungle, we walked into a clearing and the sound of incredible rushing waters. I was standing before one of the most magnificent waterfalls I had ever seen. It was here that Danielle informed me, through my interpreter, Ken Johnson, that I was now in the presence of the Spirit Water Fall, and that before I could meet Spirit Mother, I must first undergo a Spirit Cleansing Ceremony. I was told to undress. </div><div><br/></div><div>

<p>The Spirit Cleansing Ceremony was unique to me in many ways and quite profound. I had not heard of this before and no other Shaman I had interviewed ever mentioned it. Danielle told me it was time to begin a fast and to not eat or drink anything until the next evening. We spent the day in the jungle, Danielle educating me with a show-and-tell adventure of magical plants and their healing properties. As the sun began to set, Danielle led the way to the Sacred Ceremony Site.<br/><br/></p>

One of the many plant species that need to be preserved.



Walter Prunzik
Hello my name is Walter Prunzik. On a recent visit to the rainforest of Ecuador, I came into contact with the Shuars, an indigenous tribe of some of the most beautiful people on Earth. The purpose of my visit was to do my own investigation into Ayahausca, also known as the Spirit Vine. The Spirit Vine has long been rumored to have many healing properties that the Western medical community does not recognize, healing such things as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, hyper and hypothyroidism, as well as repairing hearts, kidneys, livers, and any other damaged organs in the human body. I was introduced to a Shaman named Danielle. It didn't take me long to realize that I was in the presence of a very real and actual Shaman. It was only after Danielle felt comfortable with me that I was invited into his home and into his family. That is where this magical journey began and unfolded into a mystical once in a lifetime adventure of healing, friendship and love. 

Danielle and his wife Maria with me The Journey BeginsThe days passed as I rested and Danielle appeared once again to inform me that he had decided to take me on as a patient and a student. We headed into the rain forest, stopping along the way to take pictures and rest. After a few miles of hiking a muddy trail deeper into the jungle, we walked into a clearing and the sound of incredible rushing waters. I was standing before one of the most magnificent waterfalls I had ever seen. It was here that Danielle informed me, through my interpreter, Ken Johnson, that I was now in the presence of the Spirit Water Fall, and that before I could meet Spirit Mother, I must first undergo a Spirit Cleansing Ceremony. I was told to undress. 

Ceremony at Spirit Waterfall


The Spirit Cleansing Ceremony was unique to me in many ways and quite profound. I had not heard of this before and no other Shaman I had interviewed ever mentioned it. Danielle told me it was time to begin a fast and to not eat or drink anything until the next evening. We spent the day in the jungle, Danielle educating me with a show-and-tell adventure of magical plants and their healing properties. As the sun began to set, Danielle led the way to the Sacred Ceremony Site.

The Doctor's Office


As we slogged to the end of a muddy trail, the rain forest yielded its canopy to a beautiful sunlit site. I gazed in awe at a beautifully manicured and very well built Ceremonial Village that had been in Danielle's family for many many years. This was the Scared Ceremonial Site that would become my home for the next few weeks.          The jungle comes alive at night with tree frogs, birds, and the many other unseen critters, and the orchestra begins to play the rain forest sonata that would lull me to sleep night after night. There was an excitement in their song I sensed. Although I didn't know it at the time, these critters of the rain forest would be my fellow passengers on my Ayahuasca flight.          Sunrise in the rain forest is very unique, casting beams and flecks of sunlight through the forest as it makes its morning climb, finally cresting the tree tops, bathing everything in her warm delight. It was the giggling of children that got me out of bed that morning, and as I stepped outside into the sunlight, I was greeted by shy smiling faces. Danielle's three daughters couldn't wait to play. 








The Ayahuasca TruthI participated in five Ayahuasca ceremonies. I watched how the vine was cut and prepared and I also watched as it cooked all day long. The Ayahuasca Ceremony is traditionally performed at night. That night would be the first of five ceremonies. I had several health issues that, according to doctors, would not go away. After the fifth Ayahuasca ceremony, I was free from these perplexing illnesses. That is when I realized the value and the importance of these plants of the rain forest and the Shaman's centuries old knowledge and wisdom on how to use them. We simply cannot allow the destruction of this rain forest. We must preserve this culture and we must understand everything these Shamans know.                                                                        The devastation occurring in our rain forest is no longer a secret. These people, their lands, and their cultures are under constant threat. If we can save their culture, we can save them. The most serious of threats are lumber pirates, who are constantly illegally stealing timber and illegal gold mining. These two threats alone are causing irreparable damage to our rain forest. Without your help, this way of life will surely disappear, taking with it this valuable Tribal Culture. The more contact these people have with the outside world, the better their chances for survival, and the better our chances will be to understand these valuable plant medicines and this wonderful culture that uses them.

<p>My son, Audei, is eight years old and loves airports. 
Luckily we live close to Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston and he
 gets a chance to visit it on a regular basis. He loves riding the 
inter-terminal train and visiting all the locations he has access to. He
 loves going on the parking garage roof to see the planes. He would love
 to go into the terminals, but I keep telling him we cannot unless we 
have a ticket. </p>
<p>Audei is also autistic and has trouble 
communicating due to developmental delays in speech and social skills. 
That means when Audei was first diagnosed he was completely non-verbal 
and would only communicate by pointing or other hand gestures. He would 
be in his own world most of the time, tuning out the rest of the world 
almost completely. Over the years we have seen some great improvements 
in these areas in spite of the fact he is still far behind his age 
equivalent for speech and social cognitive ability. He talks now in 
broken sentences and is eager to learn new words. He is also using more 
basic social skills including eye contact, how to greet people, be 
polite and other similar tasks we often take for granted. When compared 
to where he was and where he is now it's not hard to be proud of Audei's
 accomplishments. </p>
<p>Recently Audei participated in a Wings for Autism 
event sponsored by Arc. It gave him the opportunity to practice routine 
airport tasks like checking in luggage, getting his boarding pass, going
 through security checkpoints, entering a real passenger plane, and 
sitting through a practice ""flight"" (we also got a chance to explore the
 terminal away from the group for a bit). He was perfect the entire 
time. Too bad the plane didn't leave the ground or even taxi out of the 
terminal. Still this told me he was ready to fly on a plane, and I had 
to find a way to make it happen. </p>
<p>What I would like to do is take 
Audei on a one day, round trip flight to a nearby city. Austin is a good
 choice as I have friends there who can pick us up and we can spend a 
few hours in the city. The problem is we are set squarely on a middle 
class income with me being the sole provider. To accomplish this trip it
 would cost well over $400 for the flight alone. That's generally our 
budget for taking the entire family on a little vacation road trip. In 
other words the costs are prohibitive. <br/></p>
<p>That's where Indiegogo comes 
in. If any of you are interesting in helping a father out with 
giving his son with special needs a really special outing we would 
greatly appreciate it. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>A round trip flight to Austin for the two of us will cost approximately $450. Since Indiegogo has a minimum of $500 the plan is to put the extra money toward a fun activity to take Audei to. In all honesty we can do this with about $250-$275 and I can take care of the rest. So any contribution level we get would make a difference. <br/><br/>If we go beyond our goals any additional money would still go back into this trip in various ways. Here are what I figured we could do with the extra money:<br/><br/><p>- $150 
more would easily get us a hotel for the night and make the adventure 
even longer. An additional $50 on top of that would secure a rental car.
 </p>
<p>- $150 on top of that would pay for a nice outing to someplace 
like Six Flags Fiesta Texas or Schlitterbahn water park in San Antonio 
(just an hour and a half from Austin). Lots of options in the area to check out.  </p>
<p>- $400 more would bump up our tickets to first class. </p>
<p>Getting my son on that plane and giving him a chance to see the world 
thousands of feet above the ground is the real goal here. All this other
 stuff would just be icing on the cake. </p>
<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I have noticed a few things in our frequent 
trips to the airport. On a practical end it's a great way to entertain 
him for the price of parking. More importantly I saw an excitement in 
him every time we went there. He is much more aware of the world around him. He was soaking up all the sites and 
exploring every corridor and floor he could get to. He started to talk 
more and even socialize from time to time with people we never met 
before. These little adventures to the airport were opening him up to a wider awareness. <br/><br/>This trip is the next logical step to expand on this experience, which will likely open up even more cognitive awareness in him. This will be our first father/son trip, and this will make a good transitional step. There is no telling how he will react when up on the plane (cabin pressure changes, being confined to the seat, etc), and seeing how he deals with a short flight will prepare us for dealing with longer trips. <br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Since I am only asking for a leg up in the expenses for taking Audei to 
Austin the risks to success for that are minimal. Unless airline ticket 
prices suddenly spike in the next few months your funding will 
successfully get him in the air. If for some reason prices do spike I am
 committed to using the funds exactly as described and will do what I 
can to cover the rest of the expenses on our own.<br/>

<p><b>Why do we need your time?</b></p>
<p>During the regime of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,up to two million lives were claimed between 1975 and 1979 in what would be one of the worst mass killings of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>Since then, the Cambodian educational system was dealt a severe setback. The Khmer Rouge’s hatred towards the middle class and educated caused a wave of tortures and execution of people who were suspected of belonging in these groups, including teachers. After the fall of Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, thousands were executed. The consequences of this civil war are still visible: the educational system is still not optimal and too expensive for many poverty-stricken families.</p>
<p>This is where we come into play. Our vision is to open new doors for students living in poverty. The low wages their families earn are not sufficient to pay for their education, resulting in a high number of children without education. With no prospects of an academic and/or professional career, these children turn to illegal activities in hopes of becoming “high earners”. With drug dealers, sex workers and gamblers as their role models, youngsters are enticed into emulating the people involved in such activities and will remain trapped in the cycle of poverty. </p>

</div><p>They know what is best for their country and what is needed for improvement. By learning from the past, they can improve the country’s current state and start developing for the future. By aiding them in this process, we want to help redeveloping Cambodia.</p>
<p>So how are we going to do this? Simply by offering them the right tools for them to excel academically.  Davit Seng, one of the founders of the project is heading for Cambodia for an internship. Next to his internship he wants to find new ways to help young children with their ambitious dreams. This requires a lot of courage and a good education. By offering them the tools they need for education and showing them the faith we have in them will give them courage to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>As a group of bright-minded, well-intentioned individuals, we plan to execute a small project that contributes to the Khmers “kaa aprom”ការអប់រំ a.k.a. education. Help is needed and we invite everyone who has always wished to offer opportunities to the ones without one. If you appreciate what we are doing and want to support us in achieving this goal, don’t hesitate to donate to our cause or ask about other ways of helping.</p>
<p><b>The tools of education</b></p>
<p>Offering free education in Cambodia is already a difficult task, and any support is necessary to maintain a qualitative free education.</p>
<p>There are many ways to support students in Cambodia such as providing quality lectures (English) or providing resources which is where we focus on. During this project we collect monetary and non-monetary donations, which we can donate in the form of supplies to the school in Cambodia. This will minimize the risk of donations disappearing into the wrong pockets. </p>
<p>The tools of education that we require are:</p>
<p> -Packs of writing equipment, 2 blue pens 1 black pen, 2 pencils, a set of coloured pencils, a sharpener, an eraser, a marker, a notebook and an etui.</p>
<p>- Study books, the study books we provide are, mathematics, History, Languages books (English and Khmer)</p>
<p>- Art supplies, painting equipment, finger paint equipment, an extended supply of colored pencils</p>
<p>-Desktop computers</p>
<p><b>Stretch Goal!</b></p>
<p>We believe that children also need their own time to play, a school is not only a place to study but also <b>a place to come together </b>and create friends with same interests. By providing extra entertainment such as  sports equipment, children will have more motivation to attend classes on a weekly base. </p>
<p>If we are able to reach the following goals we shall donate  extra sports equipments to the school.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>With a collective bonus of $500,- we shall add a soccer ball (donate to unlock)</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>with a collective bonus of $1000,-  we shall add a rugby set (donate to unlock)</p>

During the regime of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia,up to two million lives were claimed between 1975 and 1979 in what would be one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century.
Since then, the Cambodian educational system was dealt a severe setback. The Khmer Rouge’s hatred towards the middle class and educated caused a wave of tortures and execution of people who were suspected of belonging in these groups, including teachers. After the fall of Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, thousands were executed. The consequences of this civil war are still visible: the educational system is still not optimal and too expensive for many poverty-stricken families.
This is where we come into play. Our vision is to open new doors for students living in poverty. The low wages their families earn are not sufficient to pay for their education, resulting in a high number of children without education. With no prospects of an academic and/or professional career, these children turn to illegal activities in hopes of becoming “high earners”. With drug dealers, sex workers and gamblers as their role models, youngsters are enticed into emulating the people involved in such activities and will remain trapped in the cycle of poverty. 











“Education allows individuals to think and act ethically, independently and critically. Who knows best how Cambodia should be shaped in the future, how to look at the present and how to learn from the past?
Cambodians themselves.”






They know what is best for their country and what is needed for improvement. By learning from the past, they can improve the country’s current state and start developing for the future. By aiding them in this process, we want to help redeveloping Cambodia.
So how are we going to do this? Simply by offering them the right tools for them to excel academically.  Davit Seng, one of the founders of the project is heading for Cambodia for an internship. Next to his internship he wants to find new ways to help young children with their ambitious dreams. This requires a lot of courage and a good education. By offering them the tools they need for education and showing them the faith we have in them will give them courage to follow their dreams.
As a group of bright-minded, well-intentioned individuals, we plan to execute a small project that contributes to the Khmers “kaa aprom”ការអប់រំ a.k.a. education. Help is needed and we invite everyone who has always wished to offer opportunities to the ones without one. If you appreciate what we are doing and want to support us in achieving this goal, don’t hesitate to donate to our cause or ask about other ways of helping.
The tools of education
Offering free education in Cambodia is already a difficult task, and any support is necessary to maintain a qualitative free education.
There are many ways to support students in Cambodia such as providing quality lectures (English) or providing resources which is where we focus on. During this project we collect monetary and non-monetary donations, which we can donate in the form of supplies to the school in Cambodia. This will minimize the risk of donations disappearing into the wrong pockets. 
The tools of education that we require are:
 -Packs of writing equipment, 2 blue pens 1 black pen, 2 pencils, a set of coloured pencils, a sharpener, an eraser, a marker, a notebook and an etui.
- Study books, the study books we provide are, mathematics, History, Languages books (English and Khmer)
- Art supplies, painting equipment, finger paint equipment, an extended supply of colored pencils
-Desktop computers
Stretch Goal!
We believe that children also need their own time to play, a school is not only a place to study but also a place to come together and create friends with same interests. By providing extra entertainment such as  sports equipment, children will have more motivation to attend classes on a weekly base. 
If we are able to reach the following goals we shall donate  extra sports equipments to the school.
·  With a collective bonus of $500,- we shall add a soccer ball (donate to unlock)
·  with a collective bonus of $1000,-  we shall add a rugby set (donate to unlock)
·  with a collective bonus of $2000,- we shall add a volleyball set (donate to unlock)
·  with a collective bonus of $5000,-  we shall add something super special (locked)

The school in Peam village
All of the donated supplies shall be donated to a school in Peam village.located an hour away from Siem Reap. This school is used by more than 300 local children each week. The school provides English classes, what has resulted in children speaking English fluently with ambitious plans to continue their studies and pursue a career beyond anything they imagined possible. Your donation will not give them the tools for these children, but also promotes the importance of quality education by providing the Cambodian society with well-educated children with new hopes and dreams. 
Our goal
We hope to provide all the students with the basics needs to support them during education. Even if we are not able to reach our full goal, we shall instead of offering each student a set, distribute loads of writing equipment and study material what will be shared between the students.
When we do reach our goal or even exceed this, we shall start looking for another school with similar qualitative education to support even more students in Cambodia
The meaning of donating
What are the odds? The odds to live with all the rights, just given?
All the basic needs are just in arms reach such as water, food and shelter. To even have the right to free education, the right to health, the right to freedom and protection and the right for our own identity. For a Cambodian child it is farfetched.
For those who have all their rights, are more likely to be unhappy duo to the fast paced circumstances, there are so many things that they have to do due to the high social demands.
I believe that those who are unhappy are stressing too much and to focused on their expectations that they tend to forget to enjoy their unique journey towards their own goals and dreams. One way to find out how special the journey really is.  Is to pause for a moment and become aware of your own surroundings, while gazing around, understand why others are not able to follow the same path. `Thinking` about why others are not able to follow is not enough, you have to `feel` why. Why are they so far behind?  Because their rights are not given to them, they do not even know how to claim their rights! Show your support and inspire and motivate the children in poverty!
Give them the courage to claim their rights, and pursue their ambitious dreams!Give them the courage to stay off the streets, and shape their own future!

<h2>Why Contribute to the LXS?</h2>The League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers is a 501c3 non-profit.  Our mission is to do our part to help San Diego educators 
<b>teach young students to be THINKERS, CREATORS, INVENTORS and the next generation of
MAKERS</b>.

<p>LXS provides hands-on ""science-ing"" to Pre-K to 5th grade learners by contributing in-classroom support for their educators -- <b>FREE to all schools and libraries. </b></p>


It takes a community to EXPLORE, DISCOVER and ENGINEER a new generation
of <i>Critical Thinkers</i>. Our talented team of <b>Local Science, Technology &amp; Engineering  Professionals</b> have developed in-classroom tours that are constantly evolving (as all good science does).  LXS brings these passionate scientists and engineers right to front of your classrooms to provide exciting, hands-on exploration and discovery experiences. <div>
<br/>
<p>Sharing our knowledge not only assists educators to meet new and evolving standards, but also <b>EXCITES KIDS' basic INSTINCT to DISCOVER and LEARN and, most importantly, to THINK.</b></p>
<b>We are very excited to have you join us!</b>
<hr/>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>Last year, LXS had over 15,000 student contacts through our unique classroom
tours.  Our current budget constraints have required us to cap our
2014-2015 <b>scheduled student contacts at 22,000</b>.  We will be visiting over 30 schools, several
public libraries, and many before- and after-school programs across San Diego County. LXS is gearing up to meet other science and engineering communities <b>throughout our nation</b> to provide valuable insight on organizing and being part of the <b>essential community effort </b>to support Science in K-5th grade.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1304456/files/20150317233427-StudentContacts-Horizontal.png?1426660467"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Community Needs Your Support</h3>
<p>LXS is a 501c3 non-profit organization.  The League of Extraordinary Scientists &amp; Engineers program is available throughout San Diego County. </p>
<p>We have $96,000 in yearly expenditures. To date, our operating budget is provided entirely by <b>personal and community donations</b>.  </p>
<p>With support from <b>Local Community Leaders</b>, collaborations with <b>other STEM education non-profits</b> and <b>generous Grants, </b>LXS can fulfill its commitment to visit over <b>1,250 classrooms during the 2015/2016 school year</b>.   </p>
<p>The LXS larger goal is to be fully funded for the next four years so we can provide a stable, FREE resource to all K-5th grade classrooms while educators and schools work towards meeting new and evolving standards. </p>
<p>Your contribution will <b>support our ability to continue</b> to give K-5 classrooms in San Diego County equal access to our hands-on, interactive science education tours. We bring a <b>unique community of specialists that is ready and willing to do its part in lifting San Diego County students</b> in the specific area of ""science-ing"".</p>

<h1>Our Programs</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>local science and engineering community has come together</b>
to create unique, hands-on, engaging STEM tours that go right into K-5<sup>th</sup> grade classrooms. With our forever-growing <b>Advisory Board</b>, LXS keeps up-to-date with the latest
scientific information and exciting discoveries.</p>
<p>Most
K-5th grade educators are not STEM professionals. <b>Passionate
teachers are constantly seeking tools and resources </b>to help give their students the best
possible education available. After every class, LXS gives the
in-class educator a tool for evaluation and feedback and we strive to work with teachers
in order to be of the most valuable use of classroom time. The gathered data
from evaluations has clearly shown<b> an overwhelming
TEACHER APPROVAL of 4.8 out of 5. </b></p>
<p>Our
scientists, engineers, graduate students and STEM/STEaM-loving parents and other volunteers teach their passion right next to the in-class educators. <b>Every
tour is designed to ENCOURAGE all KIDS to EXPLORE, DISCOVER, SHARE and THINK
like a scientist</b>.</p>

<h2>LXS Origins 

</h2>
<p>The League of Extraordinary Scientists &amp; Engineers <b>began in 2009</b>. It was clear, after
a few years of bringing bugs and other life science to before-school and after-school
programs, that <b>basic critical thinking was being over-looked in the very (early)
    years it is most easily absorbed.</b>  In July 2013, LXS's founder, Jeane Wong, gathered together an amazing group of San Diego minds to
address this issue head on. 
</p>
<p>
We entered K-5th classrooms as LXS in September
2013 and had over <b>15,000 student contacts by the end of our first school year.</b> 
This number was<b> far greater than our 4,500 target</b>. The demand was both amazing and telling. It became
absolutely clear by January 2014 that K-5 classrooms were desperately seeking hands-on science activities.  
</p>
<p>
We quickly realized that many other science
outreach programs charge schools and libraries, forcing many schools to choose between critical field trips or in-class hands-on
science experiences. We adopted our by-laws in a deliberate effort
to give equal access to all K-5th classrooms -- <b>LXS will always be FREE to all
schools and libraries</b>. </p>
<p>
<b>LXS is an incredible community effort to enhance,
introduce and engage ""science-ing"" for San Diego County K-5.
We have already touched the lives 
of tens of thousands of students, and we've only just gotten started.  Your support
will help us reach tens of thousands more.

</div></div>","Science-ing: /'sīɘns-iNG/ verb., the teach-ing, experiment-ing, explore-ing, discover-ing, hands on do-ing of science.  Science as the active pursuit of knowledge, not just passive memorization of science-facts.  Like a super hero action ... Not just a verb... but a super verb!

Why Contribute to the LXS?The League of Extraordinary Scientists and Engineers is a 501c3 non-profit.  Our mission is to do our part to help San Diego educators 
teach young students to be THINKERS, CREATORS, INVENTORS and the next generation of
MAKERS.

LXS provides hands-on ""science-ing"" to Pre-K to 5th grade learners by contributing in-classroom support for their educators -- FREE to all schools and libraries. 


It takes a community to EXPLORE, DISCOVER and ENGINEER a new generation
of Critical Thinkers. Our talented team of Local Science, Technology & Engineering  Professionals have developed in-classroom tours that are constantly evolving (as all good science does).  LXS brings these passionate scientists and engineers right to front of your classrooms to provide exciting, hands-on exploration and discovery experiences. 

Sharing our knowledge not only assists educators to meet new and evolving standards, but also EXCITES KIDS' basic INSTINCT to DISCOVER and LEARN and, most importantly, to THINK.
We are very excited to have you join us!

Our Impact
Last year, LXS had over 15,000 student contacts through our unique classroom
tours.  Our current budget constraints have required us to cap our
2014-2015 scheduled student contacts at 22,000.  We will be visiting over 30 schools, several
public libraries, and many before- and after-school programs across San Diego County. LXS is gearing up to meet other science and engineering communities throughout our nation to provide valuable insight on organizing and being part of the essential community effort to support Science in K-5th grade.

Our Community Needs Your Support
LXS is a 501c3 non-profit organization.  The League of Extraordinary Scientists & Engineers program is available throughout San Diego County. 
We have $96,000 in yearly expenditures. To date, our operating budget is provided entirely by personal and community donations.  
With support from Local Community Leaders, collaborations with other STEM education non-profits and generous Grants, LXS can fulfill its commitment to visit over 1,250 classrooms during the 2015/2016 school year.   
The LXS larger goal is to be fully funded for the next four years so we can provide a stable, FREE resource to all K-5th grade classrooms while educators and schools work towards meeting new and evolving standards. 
Your contribution will support our ability to continue to give K-5 classrooms in San Diego County equal access to our hands-on, interactive science education tours. We bring a unique community of specialists that is ready and willing to do its part in lifting San Diego County students in the specific area of ""science-ing"".

Our Programs


The local science and engineering community has come together
to create unique, hands-on, engaging STEM tours that go right into K-5th grade classrooms. With our forever-growing Advisory Board, LXS keeps up-to-date with the latest
scientific information and exciting discoveries.
Most
K-5th grade educators are not STEM professionals. Passionate
teachers are constantly seeking tools and resources to help give their students the best
possible education available. After every class, LXS gives the
in-class educator a tool for evaluation and feedback and we strive to work with teachers
in order to be of the most valuable use of classroom time. The gathered data
from evaluations has clearly shown an overwhelming
TEACHER APPROVAL of 4.8 out of 5. 
Our
scientists, engineers, graduate students and STEM/STEaM-loving parents and other volunteers teach their passion right next to the in-class educators. Every
tour is designed to ENCOURAGE all KIDS to EXPLORE, DISCOVER, SHARE and THINK
like a scientist.


ESTIVATION, HIBERNATION, MIGRATION

Where do all the snails go in the summer? 
How do different animals survive and thrive?
Counting heartbeats: What is the difference between sleeping in and hibernating?  




We explore our own heartbeats
and examine the difference from true hibernators. Otis, our desert tortoise,
and a few others will be in attendance on this tour.  This tour is in
schools mid-September - October and then we come back to the classroom for a brief visit in March after Otis wakes up so students can weigh him again to compare
with his pre-hibernation weight. 

This tour is perfect for Pre K-1st grade learners.

Estimated Student Contacts: 3,750

MAKING WAVES 

Did you know that when we take three deep breaths, the oxygen for two of those breaths comes from plants that
live in the ocean?   How do plants work?  Why aren't all plants green?  What is a holdfast?  





Marine plants may provide our atmosphere and help reduce
global warming, but we actually know so little about them!  In the ""Making Waves""
tour, students are introduced to marine plants and are encouraged to think
critically about what makes a plant a plant. We will discover
what makes marine plants different from land plants, how we use products from
marine plants every single day (think toothpaste and ice cream!), and how students become investigative marine biologists on their next beach day.  This tour
will help develop skills in critical thinking and hypothesis formation and will
introduce students to the global carbon and oxygen cycles. 

This tour is perfect for 4-5th grade learners. 
Estimated Student Contacts: 6,240

INSIDE OUT
Did you know that flies taste with their feet? What is the strongest KNOWN animal on the planet per its body weight?  Where do we classify a vinegaroon? Are bugs gross or given more data-possibly the anti-gross?


Often thought of as the
""BUG TOUR!"" This tour explores the very foundation of the ""how"" we as SCIENTISTS gather and SHARE discoveries GLOBALLY. A Dichotomous or ""Sorting"" Key is
very much like our own dresser drawers at home…We put items in different drawers so we can
easily find them. Introducing Biological Classification, this tour brings to life an EXCITEMENT for EXPLORING,
DISCOVERING, OBSERVING and ultimately drawing/WRITNG & REPORTING.  We also demonstrate how scientists all over the world share information and learn
more about OUR PLANET as GLOBAL COMMUNITY.

This tour is perfect for 3rd-4th grade learners. 
Estimated Student Contacts: 6,250

LIFE CYCLES
Did you know YOU are ""VIVA""
VIVIPAROUS? You start off your life cycle ready to eat, drink and breathe
oxygen! 



We bring tadpoles, frogs,
beetles, mantis, and more! During this tour, we teach how everything alive has
a life cycle and we talk about how those life cycles are all interconnected - Seeds to Plants,
Babies to Adults, Eggs to Butterflies. We also learn about how scientists
explore, discover, journal and share information to better understand our
planet. We observe differences in life cycles to compare and contrast including, for
example, the difference between chrysalis and cocoons. We bring live OVIPAROUS butterfly eggs to view on the LCD screen
microscope and determine what kind of caterpillar is inside based on the clue
of what kind of leaf it is on. LXS allows all of its students to come up close,
be hands-on, and explore.
This tour is perfect for 1st-3rd grade learners. 
Estimated Student Contacts: 7,750

IF YOU PLANT IT - THEY WILL COME 



After asking thousands of kids to explore and discover, we have found
that so many students neither have the easy access nor the time outside of school to really
explore. Working with Butterfly Farms, Luca Nursery, the U.S. Air Force Silver Wings
Volunteers, and gardeners in and around San Diego, LXS organizes and fundraises to build gardens that grow the specific plants that pollinators look
for. Students watch all school year as these gardens bring forth new life
cycles. LXS comes back to the gardens to teach the ""Ambassadors"" of these
gardens to maintain and educate other students during before and after school programs at each school.

Our Student Ambassador Program encourages older students
to care for these gardens while exploring and discovering with younger students during before
and after school programs in each school.

Estimated Student Contacts in our Ambassador Program: 2,250

Science-ing Nights at San Diego Public Libraries


Get your whole family excited about ""science-ing""! We wanted to extend our access
to kids and families over the summer months, and the San Diego Public Library
provides a perfect place to beat the heat and become excited to explore. This has also become a resource for homeschool communities and after school science programs. 
This tour is perfect for Pre K to 5th grade learners


Estimated Student Contacts: 3,080

SD KIDS EXPLORED & DISCOVERED



LXS Kids from all over San
Diego County send in the journal entries they have created of anything with a
life cycle that they have found and observed in and around the county! These entries
be a part of our giant LXS dichotomous ""sorting"" key. We would like the key to be
hung on display in the Downtown San Diego Library as early as August 2015, but we
need more SCIENCE JOURNALS to give our students! 

LXS Origins 


The League of Extraordinary Scientists & Engineers began in 2009. It was clear, after
a few years of bringing bugs and other life science to before-school and after-school
programs, that basic critical thinking was being over-looked in the very (early)
    years it is most easily absorbed.  In July 2013, LXS's founder, Jeane Wong, gathered together an amazing group of San Diego minds to
address this issue head on. 


We entered K-5th classrooms as LXS in September
2013 and had over 15,000 student contacts by the end of our first school year. 
This number was far greater than our 4,500 target. The demand was both amazing and telling. It became
absolutely clear by January 2014 that K-5 classrooms were desperately seeking hands-on science activities.  


We quickly realized that many other science
outreach programs charge schools and libraries, forcing many schools to choose between critical field trips or in-class hands-on
science experiences. We adopted our by-laws in a deliberate effort
to give equal access to all K-5th classrooms -- LXS will always be FREE to all
schools and libraries. 

LXS is an incredible community effort to enhance,
introduce and engage ""science-ing"" for San Diego County K-5.
We have already touched the lives 
of tens of thousands of students, and we've only just gotten started.  Your support
will help us reach tens of thousands more.

We've got plans in the works for our new building, which we will share with you as soon as possible. Here are our needs:$15,000 to purchase land$19,000 to rebuild the Dembele home and Djembeso music center$6,000 for Adama’s travel expenses to and from Ivory CoastRisks & ChallengesAs with most of West Africa, Ivory Coast faces many challenges, such as poor infrastructure, access to clean water, and political strife. But, with Adama's language skills (he speaks English, French, Bambara, and Baoule) and his personal and professional connections in Ivory Coast, he and everyone behind this campaign can meet this challenge. If we don't raise all of the money needed, we will still be able to buy a plot of land and start the building process. Any amount will help.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to contribute, you can still help! Please spread the word about this campaign; emails, sharing on social media, and even word of mouth all go a long way.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><p>A year ago
I had that plan to go on a study trip. When I looked to see manners to do
volunteer work my eye felt to a Dutch Travel Agency with a beautiful project in
Zambia, Africa. Zambia is nowadays a pour country. In particular outside the
big cities.</p><div>
</div><p>This
project is called The Linda Blind Farm School. There was this school for
children from the pre-school.<span>  All very vulnerable children with very pour,
mostly disabled parents.  And this is
what I saw: the schoolbuilding was
terrible!  80 children in a
schoolbuilding from 4 by 4 meters. With 3 classrooms in it.  I did not believe my own eyes. 3 classrooms
in 4 by 4 meters! That is a little more than my toilet at home! And 80 children
in that building!</span></p><div>
</div><p>My heart
immediately was stolen by this children. Was my first plan to be a teacher for
5 weeks here, I was convinced their needs had to be something very different. I
decided to do fundraising for a new schoolbuilding. So I designed a campaigne
to raise money for this new schoolbuilding. I came on national televison, in
the national newspaper for children and thousands of people read my blog. I made
a website, organised with friends a sponsor-tour etcetera etcetera. And the
money came in.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1399383/files/20150420101351-DSC01960.JPG?1429550031"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p><b>The first time in Zambia!</b></p><div>
</div><p>When it was
February 2014, I had raised up more than
21.000 euros for the new schoolbuilding! So I I went, for the first time, 5 weeks to Zambia.</p><div>
</div><p>In Zambia I
had the time of my life. The children
were very happy me teaching them.<span>  At
that time two teachers were in charge.  I
found two Zambian organisations to work together with me to make the dream of a
new school come true. Of course the teachers and people of the Linda Blind Farm
were very much involved. I talked to a architect to build the most beautiful
school of Zambia and negotiated about a drawing, the costlist and so more. Ii
went to the gouverment for support and I talked to the mayor about the school.
I wrote the president a letter. Of course I also travelled in Zambia for three
days (a safari) but mostly I was busy making plans for the school with my
partners in Zambia and teaching the children. </span></p><div>
</div><p>The schoolbuilding
was really so small and there were really 80 children. At times everyone came
to school this number reached up to 100. What me impressed the most was the
pleasure and happiness on the faces from the children. They really love going
to go school. The children came every
day very happy to school in spite they don’t have a lunch or had to walk a long
time on almost bare feet (and it was rainy season at that time). If they were
lucky they had popcorn as lunch.</p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1399374/files/20150420100921-DSCN0323.JPG?1429549761"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p>When I went back home the arrangements were made and the
builders began to build the school. </p><div>
</div><p><b>The second time! The opening.</b></p><div>
</div><p>In July
2014 I went back to the Linda Blind Farm. A dream came true: the school was
almost finished en I went back to open the school. It was so nice to see the
children again and to share with them the happiness of the opening ceremony. I
gave a speech for two hunderd people and counselers. It was a experience I will
never. This was a very important step to help these vulnerable children to
build a better future!</p><div>

<br/>
</div><p>Also at
that time I organized a schoolcomite. In my last week in Zambia there was the
first meeting of this school comite. It was a very special meeting. We
discussed a lot about important matters. We made a lot of arrangements. For
example: I think this is the first school with a maximum of children in one
class. 30 children. The schoolcomite decided about this because of the quality
standards they want to achieve for the children. So they asked for<span>  the solutions in Holland. And after
discussion they made this very important decision.  . We have an amazing school. </span></p><div>

</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><span><br/></span></p><div>
</div><p><b>What do the children need?</b></p><div>
</div><p>But the
dream had a second part.<span>  There is still
one big problem. My aim was also to take care the children did not have to have
their schooleducation on the floor. This problem was the lack of schoolfurniture. In the old school
there was no space to sit.  All the
children and teachers had to stand on their feet during schooltime. Their
schoolwork they had to do holding the papers on the wall and write down their
exercises. There was no money left to
buy enough furniture for all the children. </span></p><div>
</div><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431008204/e9ivxtngbywq2gd2nsge.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><div>
</div><p>What is the
need of the furniture? Not only for the children and teachers in the current
pre-school. But there is a second goal<span> 
to expand the school. The aim of the schoolcomite, the partners and my
foundation is to expand the use of the school up to 200 vulnerable children in
2017. We want to extend this school with the primary school. So the access to
education is guaranteed also when children finish their preschool and continu
their education in the primary school. Now we have only 70 children. In 2017 we
want to have all the primairy classes in our schoolbuilding. 200 children can
build a better future at that time. But 10 till 15/16 years children and young
adults, need chairs.</span></p><div>
</div><p>So we need
furniture for all this children. Once I returned in Holland I began to collect
schoolfurniture. Now I have collected over 100 tables, chairs and other
furniture and supplies. I have raised an

euros. This children need 4500 euros more to have a seat so they can build a
better future.</p><div>
</div><p>Now I see

choose to work on for my dream and the dream for this children! My challenge in this project is to see the
best way to raise the money needed for this vulnerable children. On the 18 of
June 2015  I have to present this project
to a lot of people in the Netherlands. An hour before I closed this special
crowdfundraising project. And my dream
is that at that very moment I raised the money to help those children with a
chair, a table and all the other necessary schoolneeds. All the money more than 4500 euros goes also to
the Linda Blind Farm school but on other ways, for example to train the
teachers.</span></p><div>

Together with your support, 14 youth volunteers from Youth Corps Singapore aspire to transform the way children in Cambodia learn English. We are working closely with Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Singapore. We will be introducing technology into the educational curriculum in Boys Brigade Learning Center (BBLC) in Siem Reap, Cambodia.Our initiative allows students to - leverage on technology and improve their command of English language - gives students technological knowledge to pursue better-paying jobs when they graduate- encourage independent learning outside school curriculum time 
The village has minimal exposure to technology. With your help, we will bring in tablets and enhance their learning capabilities.


Resources Needed

Your generous donations will be used to subsidize the project implementation cost including the purchase of- unwanted but fully functional tablets- wireless routers- earpieces - storage stations to ensure that the tablets will be securely stored 
These tablets and technological resources will be donated to BBLC. Full time staff from YMCA will be based in BBLC to ensure that our technologically based english curriculum is implemented as planned, even after we leave. This paves the path for sustainable change.

Impacting lives beyond borders

'The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now'. Children in Siem Reap have always been dependent on traditional methods of learning, such as using chalk and paper. We know the power of technology. We wish that those in Cambodia could harness technology and seize these opportunities. With the endless possibilities that technology can bring, it is never too late to introduce technology to them. 
Why Cambodia?
According to the Unesco National Education Support Strategy Report (2010), - An average Cambodian primary school has 1 teacher to 50 students.- High student to teacher ratio means that each student receive less attention, making the learning process a challenging one for most students. Independent learning is impossible due to limited resources. With tablets, students can learn at their own time.- Only 12.4% of the government's expenditure is spent on education.- 32% of the population survives on less than a dollar a day. Parents are unable to self-fund their children's education.
By integrating technology into the BBLC's educational curriculum, we can nurture the young minds and empower them to become successful people in society. it serves as a starting point for children to explore other methods of learning. These children can access the usage of educational apps on the tablets on their own and improve their command of English language. Together we increase their literacy rates, we open up opportunities for them to seize better paying jobs, we elevate them out of poverty. Technology will change their lives!

We strongly believe that the technological advances can greatly contribute to developing a thoughtful, educated, and confident young generation of professionals in Armenia. That’s why we created the eLearning, cloud-based portal of Dasaran (which means ‘classroom’ in Armenian) as a vehicle to help realize our vision for a 21st century education for Armenia’s new generation. Since its inception in 2009 Dasaran has grown into a large-scale feasible project and a unique online education network connecting all schools across Armenia: providing a common workspace for communication, co-learning, co-creation and school management for all stakeholders in the pedagogy system—students, teachers, parents and local authorities.In 2009, the introduction of e-tools (e-Gradebook and e-Planner) into Armenia’s school management network system was pioneered to help raise transparency in the school systems and provide effective monitoring for all parties involved in the education process.Following this, our pilot project developed into a virtual communication platform that connected school age students across Armenia allowing for social interaction, sharing and a gamified content that turned learning into a fun, entertaining and more effective experience. A special online reward scheme—points and badges— was created to recognize and share the achievements of every student within their circle of classmates, thus encouraging healthy competition to improve school performance. 
After six years of dedicated, volunteer hard work, we proudly serve a user community of 925,383, which includes: 437,706 students, 437,706 parents/guardians, and 49,911 teachers in 1,495 schools across Armenia and Artsakh.

Our lacking school-based sex education, <a href=""http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_SE.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">which mandates the stressing of abstinence in over half our U.S. states</a>, paired with our cultural knack for social stigmatization has made sure of it. As women are taught to be sexually receptive, passive, and submissive, or, to “Just take it”, men are being socialized to sexually take charge, to “know everything”, to be emotionally detached, or, to “Just fake it”.</p><p>These socially-prescribed, gendered sexual roles puts everyone in an often non-consensual and terribly misinformed place with sex. Socially and formally, we are teaching both youth and adults to keep their mouths shut when it comes to sex, with our very masculinity or femininity at stake. </p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Modern sex education - learned through media, peers and government-funded school-based sex education - is teaching youth to be silent about sex unless the word spoken is simply  “NO”. </i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p>However, young people are saying yes to sex. <a href=""http://www.massteenpregnancy.org/research/teen-sexual-behavior"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">73% of adolescents are having sex by the age of 19 and about one in seven teens have had sex before their 15th birthday</a>.

THE FULL STORYWe are really bad at talking about sex. Our lacking school-based sex education, which mandates the stressing of abstinence in over half our U.S. states, paired with our cultural knack for social stigmatization has made sure of it. As women are taught to be sexually receptive, passive, and submissive, or, to “Just take it”, men are being socialized to sexually take charge, to “know everything”, to be emotionally detached, or, to “Just fake it”.These socially-prescribed, gendered sexual roles puts everyone in an often non-consensual and terribly misinformed place with sex. Socially and formally, we are teaching both youth and adults to keep their mouths shut when it comes to sex, with our very masculinity or femininity at stake. Modern sex education - learned through media, peers and government-funded school-based sex education - is teaching youth to be silent about sex unless the word spoken is simply  “NO”. However, young people are saying yes to sex. 73% of adolescents are having sex by the age of 19 and about one in seven teens have had sex before their 15th birthday. This gap between youth’s lived experience and the sex education available to them shuts down any opportunity youth have to engage in a dialogue about the role of sex in their real lives with the information they need to make consensual choices for themselves and with their partners. And the impact of this matters:Approximately 8 in 10 teen girls and 1 in 3 teen boys who had sex at age 14 or younger report that they either didn’t really want to have sex at the time, or had mixed feelings about having sex at the time.
A majority (53%) of millennials say that high schools are not doing enough to address the issue of sexual assault. 
Women between the ages of 16 and 24 are 4x more likely to be raped than women in other age groups.
Approximately 1 in 8 lesbian women and nearly half of bisexual women experience rape in their lifetime.
Nearly half of bisexual men and 4 in 10 gay men have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime.
A staggering 64% of transgender people have experienced sexual assault in their lifetime.
Researchers found that among 12 to 25 year olds in the Netherlands, where sexuality education begins in primary school and includes topics such a sexual diversity & sexual assertiveness training, most say they had  “wanted and fun” first sexual experiences. 
In contrast, 66 percent of sexually active American teens surveyed said they wished that they had waited longer to have sex for the first time.
Four in ten millennials say that school sex education classes were not helpful to them in making decisions about sex and relationships.73% are having sex. But is it consensual? Consent is about arriving at and saying an enthusiastic yes. Consensual sex is sexual activity that occurs with informed, enthusiastic agreement between each partner involved. Consent is an active, ongoing process that can be revoked or revised at any time. Consent can only be achieved via conversation and communication, by asking for permission and being granted that permission verbally. Consent is spoken. Consent is informed. Consent is verbal.If the sex education taught in schools is teaching our youth to be silent and uninformed about sex, we are teaching non-consensuality to our youth. If we are denying our youth accurate information about sex, we are teaching them to make misinformed decisions about sex.When we teach youth to never ask questions about themselves or others in regards to sex, we are teaching them to “just take it” and to “just fake it”. Consent-based sex education can break this cycle.#FUNDCONSENT aims to raise money to teach consent-based sex education workshops to teenaged youth, with no cost to their hosting school or organization.

And that consensual skills will make a lifelong positive impact.(At a consent for youth workshop I taught earlier this year, a youth participant shows off her 'consent cookie' made during our sugary activity that helps bring to life consent strategies learned earlier in the workshop)The goal of every consent-based sex education workshop is to meet youth where they’re at in their lives and relationships in an approachable & appropriate setting to help them break down the linguistic, mental & emotional barriers standing in the way of creating a culture of consensual communication at their schools, in their peer groups and for their future sexual explorations.This integrative approach to youth sex education isn’t new and boasts some of the world’s best outcomes when it comes to teen sexual health, happiness and behavior. Yet this type of sex education is simply not funded by the U.S. government nor is it taught in our traditional schools.

</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Brothers Empowered to Teach Initiative</b>’s (BE2T) mission is to close the achievement gap for at-risk students by inspiring and incentivizing men of color to choose education as a career starting in New Orleans. Our vision is to inspire all <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px;"">children especially those at-risk to drop out, to expand their vision of success and defy the odds.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1250885/files/20150226072334-2014-11-15_09.22.48.jpg?1424964214"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px;"">In 2012, co-founders Kristyna Jones and Larry Irvin created Brothers Empowered to Teach out of a passion to change the trajectory of the lives of at-risk students in New Orleans. Larry's own experience as a young black man growing up in the city and the countless losses of friends and peers to drugs, the streets, or dropping out  is one of the drivers to its creation. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px;""> The difference between Larry and his peers and friends was that he went on to graduate from college.   We decided that the best way to affect that trajectory was in the classroom--where students spend 8 hours (or more) a day 5 days a week. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Solution</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">BE2T recruits men of color to
consider education as a career and enter the classroom with the tools each man
needs to be impactful and prepared for the rigors of teaching.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We do this two ways:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>The BE2T
Fellowship- </b>The Fellowship program is
geared toward full-time enrolled college students . Participants are eligible
beginning Sophomore year to be a part of our three year fellowship program.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">•</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> 
</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Change
Track</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">— The Change Track is
specifically for men of color who may have already had a career in another
profession, are older students returning to </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px;"">school, or are looking to change
from their current career to education.</span></p>
<p>We designed a program that directly aims to engage and connect black men to careers in education. We examined other teacher exploration and preparation programs and decided that in order to turn the face of teaching on its head (85% of all teachers, are white, female and from the suburbs) we needed to start earlier while young men are in college to connect them to the idea--and getting them to buy in to teaching. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Both programs culminate in certification and
readiness for the classroom. </b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
Black men need to start
investing in the education of black men. 
Young men of color need to see more men who look like them in front of
the classroom. Over the next 5 years you will see Brothers Empowered to Teach
bring 100 men of color to careers in the education space in New Orleans alone. Men in the classroom can have a profound effect on the academic trajectory of their students. According to the Center for American Progress, the relationship between the presence of African American teachers in schools and African American students success  showed significant impact on ""time out of school"" (discipline actions like suspension) and the percentage of students placed in special education versus gifted programs.  </span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We did a pilot last fall to see if we could recruit young black men to consider teaching. Since then, 40 young men have showed interest. We were only able to accept 7. Three have applied for teaching opportunities. None of these men was considering teaching. Now they are in the classroom. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And the schools in New Orleans wanted our candidates yesterday. </p>
<p><br/></p>

Starting in the 8th grade, 50% of young black men in New Orleans will drop out.  This
population is feeding our prison system. How can
kids make better choices if they don’t see better examples standing before them
everyday.
Teachers
are some of the most influential people in the lives of a student. So why don’t
we treat them that way?  In this
city, less than 3% of teachers are black men.  

Who we are
 
Brothers Empowered to Teach Initiative’s (BE2T) mission is to close the achievement gap for at-risk students by inspiring and incentivizing men of color to choose education as a career starting in New Orleans. Our vision is to inspire all children especially those at-risk to drop out, to expand their vision of success and defy the odds.


In 2012, co-founders Kristyna Jones and Larry Irvin created Brothers Empowered to Teach out of a passion to change the trajectory of the lives of at-risk students in New Orleans. Larry's own experience as a young black man growing up in the city and the countless losses of friends and peers to drugs, the streets, or dropping out  is one of the drivers to its creation.  The difference between Larry and his peers and friends was that he went on to graduate from college.   We decided that the best way to affect that trajectory was in the classroom--where students spend 8 hours (or more) a day 5 days a week. 
     The Solution BE2T recruits men of color to
consider education as a career and enter the classroom with the tools each man
needs to be impactful and prepared for the rigors of teaching.


We do this two ways:
• 
The BE2T
Fellowship- The Fellowship program is
geared toward full-time enrolled college students . Participants are eligible
beginning Sophomore year to be a part of our three year fellowship program.  


 • 
The Change
Track— The Change Track is
specifically for men of color who may have already had a career in another
profession, are older students returning to school, or are looking to change
from their current career to education.
We designed a program that directly aims to engage and connect black men to careers in education. We examined other teacher exploration and preparation programs and decided that in order to turn the face of teaching on its head (85% of all teachers, are white, female and from the suburbs) we needed to start earlier while young men are in college to connect them to the idea--and getting them to buy in to teaching. 


Both programs culminate in certification and
readiness for the classroom. 

The Impact
 
Black men need to start
investing in the education of black men. 
Young men of color need to see more men who look like them in front of
the classroom. Over the next 5 years you will see Brothers Empowered to Teach
bring 100 men of color to careers in the education space in New Orleans alone. Men in the classroom can have a profound effect on the academic trajectory of their students. According to the Center for American Progress, the relationship between the presence of African American teachers in schools and African American students success  showed significant impact on ""time out of school"" (discipline actions like suspension) and the percentage of students placed in special education versus gifted programs.  



We did a pilot last fall to see if we could recruit young black men to consider teaching. Since then, 40 young men have showed interest. We were only able to accept 7. Three have applied for teaching opportunities. None of these men was considering teaching. Now they are in the classroom. 


And the schools in New Orleans wanted our candidates yesterday. 

    Risks & Challenges 
There are two issues that keep black men from choosing the classroom. Black men don’t consider teaching and the programs that are out there are too short and insufficient in preparing and attracting teachers that are culturally competent.  First we have to attach them to the work. And then we have to train them to have the confidence to be an incredible teacher.  We will need to re-brand education as a career. 
The other challenge is competition from larger teacher preparation and teacher recruitment programs. All of these programs are looking for solutions to attract greater numbers of people of color--especially black men--to the classroom.  These programs have struggled mightily to find a solution.


We have seen from our pilot that by starting early, with discreet exposure to working children we can have a better chance of connecting college men to working in schools.

We need your help funding the development of our first graphic novel.
Why a graphic novel?
 
   
There are relatively few strategies
that really work when teaching social skills to those with autism, and the ICONz® Curriculum already
incorporates almost all of them. However, since students with ASD
tend to be highly visually oriented, comic books or graphic novels are
especially effective teaching tools.
Our immediate goal is to produce a
series of graphic novels that expand on the skills already taught through the ICONz®
Curriculum but that can also be used as stand-alone materials by parents, teachers, social

We can only imagine how much more impacting the Curriculum can be when we add graphic novels.

<p><b>A toolbox to develop your creativity!</b> Every time you create
a story your associations will come to you faster and your confidence will
grow. </p>
<p><b>One box - several creativity games. </b>Use the cards for with
friends and family of all ages to do;</p>
<p> · Storytelling challenges in a group</p>
<p>· Charades/pantomime</p>
<p>· Creating
your own song lyrics</p>
<p>· Plot
making for writing, film or cartoons</p>
<p>· Guessing
games</p>
<p>· Creating
your own game!</p>
<p><b>From passive consumer to active creator. </b>Instead of listening
to a story you start telling or playing it yourself. Instead of being bound by
a book, the cards can be picked up and played with. </p>
<p><b>Minimalism for maximal creativity. </b>To not hamper the
creativity of the storyteller we made the cards minimalistic, without cultural
references or too much individual character. We often made over ten versions of each card to get them just right! The cards are also
language neutral as they only use images – only the instructions are in English
(for now!)</p>
<p><b>Durability and usability. </b>We want to put the cards in a wooden box to keep out on the sofa table all the time.  As it will last for generations, even if a card or two goes
missing, it is good for the environment too!</p>
<p><b>An educational tool. </b>Teachers, drama/music
pedagogues as well as speech therapists, psychologists, team builders and
evaluators have given us input along the way. Here a taste of the
pedagogical potential of the Story Cards:</p>
<p>* Write a
story from four Story Cards (Language teaching)</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">* In pairs,
pick two “who” cards and make a story about friendship, injustice or bullying….
(Reflections on feelings, community etc)</span></p>
<p>The cards can
also for example be used for icebreakers, address group challenges or evaluations.</p>
<p><b>One for me – one for you. </b>Creativity and story
telling is about sharing – which is why one set of 26 cards will be given to a
refugee child for every
package of Story Cards sold, starting with Syrian children coming trough Europe. The cards will be distributed starting from
January 2015 and our first cooperation partner is a local Bosnian NGO where the
Goggo Designer Ismet is active. </p>

a helping hand and so she developed the Goggo Story Cards as a way to practice
creativity and grow in confidence. Since then she has teamed up with Ismet, a
Bosnian designer and social entrepreneur, and for the last two years they
have worked passionately with developing the perfect set!




How to
do it? It's
simple! You just flip a card from each category:  WHO; WHERE; WHAT and HOW
to find the inspiration to make up your own story. Run out of ideas? Just
flip the next card, and the next - or ask your friend to continue!  The
box also comes with several instructions for
creativity challenges; storytelling in group, charades, guessing
games - all to stimulate creativity while having fun! 
""...but already after a few weeks on his
space travel he began to feel lonely and decided to write a letter, as message
in a bottle for outer space ..."". How
would you continue?
A TOOLBOX FOR CREATIVITY


The Goggo Story Cards Box (L)
A set of 140 cards in 4 categories inside a beautiful wooden box
that will never run out of stories. The cards are ready but only with the funds
raised in this campaign we will be able to produce the box and make this
creativity tool a physical reality!
Travelpack: Goggo to go  (S)
This is a smaller version of the Goggo Story Cards with 52 cards
in 4 categories - perfect for the bus ride! The travel pack is already in
production and will make it out before Christmas to early backers!  

THE GOGGO VISION
A toolbox to develop your creativity! Every time you create
a story your associations will come to you faster and your confidence will
grow. 
One box - several creativity games. Use the cards for with
friends and family of all ages to do;
 · Storytelling challenges in a group
· Charades/pantomime
· Creating
your own song lyrics
· Plot
making for writing, film or cartoons
· Guessing
games
· Creating
your own game!
From passive consumer to active creator. Instead of listening
to a story you start telling or playing it yourself. Instead of being bound by
a book, the cards can be picked up and played with. 
Minimalism for maximal creativity. To not hamper the
creativity of the storyteller we made the cards minimalistic, without cultural
references or too much individual character. We often made over ten versions of each card to get them just right! The cards are also
language neutral as they only use images – only the instructions are in English
(for now!)
Durability and usability. We want to put the cards in a wooden box to keep out on the sofa table all the time.  As it will last for generations, even if a card or two goes
missing, it is good for the environment too!
An educational tool. Teachers, drama/music
pedagogues as well as speech therapists, psychologists, team builders and
evaluators have given us input along the way. Here a taste of the
pedagogical potential of the Story Cards:
* Write a
story from four Story Cards (Language teaching)* In pairs,
pick two “who” cards and make a story about friendship, injustice or bullying….
(Reflections on feelings, community etc)
The cards can
also for example be used for icebreakers, address group challenges or evaluations.
One for me – one for you. Creativity and story
telling is about sharing – which is why one set of 26 cards will be given to a
refugee child for every
package of Story Cards sold, starting with Syrian children coming trough Europe. The cards will be distributed starting from
January 2015 and our first cooperation partner is a local Bosnian NGO where the
Goggo Designer Ismet is active. 


RISKS
1. Will we manage to get the money together to produce a wooden
box for the large version of the Story Cards and keep retail price low enough
by a large production order quantity? 
2. Goggo to go (S) will be sent to you 2 weeks before X-mas
at the latest. If the postal service messes up delivery and it does not reach
you in time for X-mas, let us know and we can send you a digital gift card in
the meantime!
CROWDFUNDING FOR CREATIVITY

donated their time and expertise and we have invested as much time, effort and
money as possible. Now we need your help!

Overview of the 1 Hour Program
Video Introduction - The Explanation of Our Existence - The Speck – The Wits +
The Explanation of the 3 Subjects & What Participants Will Learn
An Inhabited World is Hiding in Plain Sight
Would You Like The Opportunity to Photograph - What Is Hiding In Plain Sight?
Photographs have been captured of legendary-mythological living creatures from the writings of antiquity, and participants can produce photographic evidence with their camera, or cell phone camera and using the Software Application.
The Mark of Inheritance, The Mark of the Curse
Do You Possess The Mark of the Inheritance or The Mark of the Curse?
Mankind has lost the knowledge of their heritage, because it has been replaced with an identity, and categorized by race to disguise their origin to prevent them the opportunity to change their fate. 
Participants will be able to use the scientific method of the Smithsonian to learn who they are, and their camera, or cell phone camera with the Software Application to reveal if they possess an inheritance or a curse.
The Solution Everyone Can Use
Would You Like To Defeat Death & Remove Its Claim On Your Soul?
The mystery is revealed in the writings of antiquity and the instructions are provided to Participants on how to cleanse their flesh with the light of the sun, by using the optimum position to drive darkness out of their bodies that will remove death's claim of their soul/spirit, which is revealed in these writings as their reward. The Software Application is used with the image produced by a camera or cell phone camera to measure the results they achieve compared to the Reference Guide that will provide photographic evidence of their success.
Summary
The Special Edition communicates Knowledge, Wisdom, & Understanding that everyone can achieve.
The Benefits of the Participation Program
There is a contentious line drawn between science and the recorded history of religion, separating believers and non-believer and offered an opportunity for an interdisciplinary research that could apply the tools of science to disprove or verify the claims of the humanities.
The Participation Program
The Special Edition is a 3 subject presentation that allows everyone to evaluate the hypothesis, review the references, and by following the instructions in the use of the software application to produce photographic evidence for their personal review and consideration.
How Was the Program Formed?
A multidisciplinary research was required to develop a methodology that was simple to present with recognized sources that everyone can use to reacquire this lost knowledge by combining the references of antiquity and comparing the results they will produce.
The Evaluation Framework
The development required the disciplines of science and the participation of the humanities to evaluate the results of the investigation, and produce a presentation that would allow everyone to use their personal knowledge and experience and compare the recognized references and reproducible evidence they will produce.
Summary of the Journey
The journey to this time in the present has required 3-decades of exhaustive investigation, and the commercial development and availability of handheld devices that possess computing power are available to the public and allows everyone to photograph and confirm-what is hiding in plain sight.
The Impact
If everyone used The Solution, according to the writings of antiquity, then death could not claim the remaining souls of mankind.

</p><p>Our budget for the full completion of the center which includes a classroom, refuge home, office space and community store is US$15,000.  (<b>Budget Breakdown below</b>)</p><p><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Challenge</span></b><br/></p><p>By GDP per capita, Malawi is the world’s poorest country. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, 74 per cent of the Malawian population lives below the income poverty line of US$1.25 a day. Most families cannot afford to finance their children’s education which ranges between $30 and over annually. At secondary school age, only 33% of the sum that should be enrolled in secondary school education is attending school. From this 33%, only 42% are girls. Most girls marry early in exchange for dowry; payment from the husband’s family. With the infrequency of social mobility in Malawi, her daughter and her daughter’s daughter often face the same fate: early marriage and insufficient schooling. Over time this vicious cycle has created a substantial population of women who are undereducated, jobless and facing extreme poverty.</p><p><b>Our Approach</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445888185/fydvw54bguryrdllaeyn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Tiwale means, “let us shine/glow,” in Chichewa. Tiwale was set up as a youth-led community based organization to empower Malawian women by providing economic opportunities through leadership workshops, micro-finance loans, vocational skills training and education grants.  </p><p>Tiwale started with a team of five youth ranging from 14 to 19 years old. The goal was to design a business education training program that was to be followed by micro-loans to fellow young women in poverty. The intended prototype was 10 women for the education program and 4 women to start businesses. The response however was tremendous with a surprise attendance of 150 women in the education program and a selected 12 women to initiate the micro-business program.  </p><p>To date, Tiwale has grown training 150 women in the business education programs, guiding 40 women to start businesses via micro-loans and another 50 women undergoing a vocational skills training program. The goal has been to promote the education of women and so with selling of fabrics made in the training program, Tiwale secured US$2,500 to purchase a plot of land to build an education center. With this space, we will provide secondary school education classes and further vocational skills development for the women in Ntsiriza community.</p><p></p>

</tbody></table></div>","To grow our efforts at providing economic opportunities for Malawian women, Tiwale has acquired a plot to construct an education center. This center will provide secondary school education classes and further vocational skills training for the women of Ntsiriza Community, Malawi.

Project Women’s Center for Education and EntrepreneurshipOur goal is to construct a space for education and entrepreneurship for women in Malawi. In the past, we have given school grants for women to return to school, however, two challenges were reported:



The schools were located in far communities and so participants could not afford and spare the time for the commute.


Their classmates in the schools were younger children which was embarrassing and discouraging. 




The education center is targeted as a space for women of all ages who were forced to leave school early due to varied circumstances. 
Tiwale will hire a teachers that will provide daily evening classes at a time feasible for the women of the community. The classes will vary ranging from sciences, humanities, languages and the arts. The goal is to aid our participants towards the Malawi Secondary Certificate of Education (MSCE).
Our timeline:



August-September: Purchase plot for construction of education center


September: Cost calculations and team building


October-November: Fundraising and sells of vocational skills training products


December 2015: Commence construction of education center


February/March 2016: Launch classes!!



We are sourcing collaborations with organizations that recycle hardware so as to contract a donation for computers. We intend to host computer training summer camps, weekly art studio space popups and biweekly health education gatherings. With these activities together, we hope to empower 200 women annually. Moreover, as the space we purchased already has a small home in need of repairs. We want to improve this structure and turn it into a refuge for women who are temporarily homeless.

Project budget:

Our budget for the full completion of the center which includes a classroom, refuge home, office space and community store is US$15,000.  (Budget Breakdown below) The ChallengeBy GDP per capita, Malawi is the world’s poorest country. According to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, 74 per cent of the Malawian population lives below the income poverty line of US$1.25 a day. Most families cannot afford to finance their children’s education which ranges between $30 and over annually. At secondary school age, only 33% of the sum that should be enrolled in secondary school education is attending school. From this 33%, only 42% are girls. Most girls marry early in exchange for dowry; payment from the husband’s family. With the infrequency of social mobility in Malawi, her daughter and her daughter’s daughter often face the same fate: early marriage and insufficient schooling. Over time this vicious cycle has created a substantial population of women who are undereducated, jobless and facing extreme poverty.Our ApproachTiwale means, “let us shine/glow,” in Chichewa. Tiwale was set up as a youth-led community based organization to empower Malawian women by providing economic opportunities through leadership workshops, micro-finance loans, vocational skills training and education grants.  Tiwale started with a team of five youth ranging from 14 to 19 years old. The goal was to design a business education training program that was to be followed by micro-loans to fellow young women in poverty. The intended prototype was 10 women for the education program and 4 women to start businesses. The response however was tremendous with a surprise attendance of 150 women in the education program and a selected 12 women to initiate the micro-business program.  To date, Tiwale has grown training 150 women in the business education programs, guiding 40 women to start businesses via micro-loans and another 50 women undergoing a vocational skills training program. The goal has been to promote the education of women and so with selling of fabrics made in the training program, Tiwale secured US$2,500 to purchase a plot of land to build an education center. With this space, we will provide secondary school education classes and further vocational skills development for the women in Ntsiriza community.

<h3>Passion for Connecting</h3>
<p>It's so hard to put into words my passion for creating a community bookstore. I've been in publishing and book selling since 1989. I've worked at large independent bookstores in San Francisco and Oakland. In addition to front line retail experience I also have book marketing experience-I've worked for various publishers here on the West Coast from hippie independent publishing like Ten Speed Press to multimillion dollar corporate companies such as Harcourt. I've also worked at the University of California Press and some other educational publishers in between. BUT my life long love has always been book selling. Bookstores are an oasis for these challenging times. They are a place to give voice to those who would be silenced, solace to those who are in strife, knowledge to those who are seekers.</p>

<p>St. Johns is a growing community. The University of Portland is just down the road. In town there is Way Finding Academy, an alternative 2 year college, Roosevelt High School which enrolled an unanticipated 300 students this fall, 3 elementary schools with additional kindergarten classes added-all in walking distance to Two Rivers Bookstore. The community itself has asked for an alternative meeting place to the bars and other eating/drinking establishments. I have been doing pop-up bookstores in St. Johns for the last several years. I've collected hundreds of emails of the folks who are dying for a bookstore.</p>
<p>Join <u>Two Rivers Facebook Group</u>!</p>
<h3><strong>What Two Rivers will offer the community:</strong></h3>
<p>Two Rivers will be a community focused store, carrying new titles, hosting events like storybook hour, author readings, book clubs, cookbook clubs, salon discussion groups, literary karaoke, workshops, teacher back to school nights and much more. Eventually I hope to create a student run publishing program, where the material is written by students, edited, designed and produced by students in the hopes of creating career opportunities for a new and diverse generation of publishers.</p>
<h3>I Live Here Too</h3>
<p>I'm very active in the St. Johns Community. I live just down the road from the retail space. I participate in many community organizations; The St. Johns Boosters (the local business association), The St. Johns Women's Choir, and the St. Johns Center for Opportunity (SJO). In the last year I have run pop-up shops in conjunction with SJO sponsored events like Biz Mob, the St. Johns Bizarre and a seasonal curated collection set up in RoM Shoes. In addition to pop-up bookstores, I've hosted and organized a neighbor Holiday Craft Bizarre. <strong>I love this community and would love to contribute to its growth by adding a neighborhood bookstore. All this to say, I can get things done with your help!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Two Rivers Bookstore is trying to open on a shoestring. Your contributions will help:</p>
<ul><li>Opening and operating expenses for the first year:<ul>
<li>Opening and holiday inventory.</li>
<li>POS system</li>
<li>Operating costs such as credit card processing, equipment</li>
<li>And of course Indiegogo needs their share for helping us reach all of you!</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>We're running a 40 day campaign, To reach our goal that's $2500 a day or 100 $1000 contributions. Spread the word!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Independent Bookstores are Still Thriving</h3>
<p>The strength of an independent bookseller is knowing its community, listening to their needs and responding with books and events that reflect that community (something Amazon can't do). One of the biggest obstacles I've been coming up against are the doubters-the ones who say bookstores are dying off. Well I'm here to tell you it's not true.</p>
<p><strong>Some very reliable news outlets have some very factual reports:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/03/29/598053563/why-the-number-of-independent-bookstores-increased-during-the-retail-apocalypse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Between 2009-2015 the number of Independent Bookstore have increased by 35% (NPR)</a></p>

<h3>Spread the Word Like Your Hearts on Fire</h3>
<p>Books and reading are my passion. If you  or anyone you know is  a book lover, a reader, a community member or anyone that might support this crazy dream of mine please contribute or forward this campaign.</p>
<p>Use Indiegogo's share tools #stjohnsreads or find us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/452898528384028/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tworiversbooks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></p>
<p>Thank you everyone! I would not have been able to get this far without the support and encouragement of my sister, friends and neighbors, especially the lady business owners here in St. Johns. Thank you Thank you! A special thanks to Drake Stewart who helped pull of a last minute miracle.</p>

What Two Rivers will offer the community:
Two Rivers will be a community focused store, carrying new titles, hosting events like storybook hour, author readings, book clubs, cookbook clubs, salon discussion groups, literary karaoke, workshops, teacher back to school nights and much more. Eventually I hope to create a student run publishing program, where the material is written by students, edited, designed and produced by students in the hopes of creating career opportunities for a new and diverse generation of publishers.
I Live Here Too
I'm very active in the St. Johns Community. I live just down the road from the retail space. I participate in many community organizations; The St. Johns Boosters (the local business association), The St. Johns Women's Choir, and the St. Johns Center for Opportunity (SJO). In the last year I have run pop-up shops in conjunction with SJO sponsored events like Biz Mob, the St. Johns Bizarre and a seasonal curated collection set up in RoM Shoes. In addition to pop-up bookstores, I've hosted and organized a neighbor Holiday Craft Bizarre. I love this community and would love to contribute to its growth by adding a neighborhood bookstore. All this to say, I can get things done with your help!

What We Need
Two Rivers Bookstore is trying to open on a shoestring. Your contributions will help:
Opening and operating expenses for the first year:
Opening and holiday inventory.
POS system
Operating costs such as credit card processing, equipment
And of course Indiegogo needs their share for helping us reach all of you!


We're running a 40 day campaign, To reach our goal that's $2500 a day or 100 $1000 contributions. Spread the word!

Independent Bookstores are Still Thriving
The strength of an independent bookseller is knowing its community, listening to their needs and responding with books and events that reflect that community (something Amazon can't do). One of the biggest obstacles I've been coming up against are the doubters-the ones who say bookstores are dying off. Well I'm here to tell you it's not true.
Some very reliable news outlets have some very factual reports:
Between 2009-2015 the number of Independent Bookstore have increased by 35% (NPR)
New stores are opening all the time (ABA resource for articles)
Independent Bookstores are Booming (CBS, April 2018)
Bookstore Sales are up (Forbes, May 2018)

Spread the Word Like Your Hearts on Fire
Books and reading are my passion. If you  or anyone you know is  a book lover, a reader, a community member or anyone that might support this crazy dream of mine please contribute or forward this campaign.
Use Indiegogo's share tools #stjohnsreads or find us on Facebook or Instagram
Thank you everyone! I would not have been able to get this far without the support and encouragement of my sister, friends and neighbors, especially the lady business owners here in St. Johns. Thank you Thank you! A special thanks to Drake Stewart who helped pull of a last minute miracle.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Brain Retrain™ is not about replacement. While the flames of autism's prevalence continues at this level of intensity, Brain Retrain is about immediate proactive intervention in getting for autism, accessibility to solutions for learning and communication. Accessibility is defined as having an awareness of what, where and how these solutions are currently available, and being able to use them in terms of time, affordability and with effective results for each learner’s individuality. Brain Retrain brings this all together by being built as an interactive and digital upgrade of current, new and forward thinking principles and practices. And it is presented on a Digital Platform.</p><h3>How do we know Brain Retrain™ works? </h3><p>We know that Brain Retrain™ works because it has been rigorously tested within the Autism Learning Lab for the past 4 years. But, it works mainly because it is built upon updated research, the principles of time tested and evidenced based methodologies currently being used, (all be it, with limited accessibility), and especially, because for the first time, a special education method for autism is interwoven with non-invasive, modern brain retraining technologies. Brain Retrain™ does not seek to reinvent the wheel. Instead, Brain Retrain™ has introduced gears onto those wheels, making them more efficiently accessible and affordable. Brain Retrain™ recognizes that autism’s students respond differently to different methods of learning and communicating. And, although 87 percent of these students will respond positively to the Brain Retrain™ methodology (according to the Autism Learning Lab’s data), there is a small percentage of these students who will respond best to certain principles, that have been updated and re-purposed from other currently practiced methods. As the definitive platform for learning and communications in autism, Brain Retrain™ is built to identify the principles of those method such learners are best responding to.</p><p><i><u><strong>OUR COMPLETE AUTISM RESOURCE DIRECTORY</strong></u></i></p><h3>We have in Brain Retrain™, a directory of all special education methods and resources for autism spectrum disorders. It is called our<strong> Applications Directory.</strong> It offers a constantly updated listing and their details, of new technologies, teachers of all methods, and their locations, nationally. After evaluating each learner’s additional needs, and using this resource directory, Brain Retrain™ would refer that particular learner to something, somewhere, or someone that utilizes what the learner additionally requires.

In 2006 he founded and initially self-funded the Dreamweaver House Foundation.  In addition to bringing some of the brightest and most innovative international MDs, neuro scientists, behavioral scientists and educators together, to investigate alternative options in treatment and learning for autism, he has pioneered a revolutionary new concept of using children’s movies, utilizing a new and patented media technology, to teach, encourage and improve reading and language skills to children.</p><p>Len Anthony’s academic background has steered him through a BA program in Theater and English and an Associate BSc in Photography, to a career launching fine arts degree in Film Production from the School of Visual Arts and his business initiating work in the graduate diploma program in Arts Management at Adelphi University.  In 2002 Len directed the new American drama ‘REFLECTIONS’, written by Joseph Koster. ‘REFLECTIONS’ opened Off- Broadway at New York's famed Cherry Lane Theater to rave reviews, as his tenure as a Director in the Actor’s Studio’s MFA program at New School University ended.</p></div>","The Dreamweaver House Autism Foundation The Autism Learning Laboratory Initiative (A.L.L.) Re purposed Special Education MethodsUpdated by an Interwoven Network of Interactive Digital ApplicationsNoninvasive Cutting Edge Brain Technologies Seamlessly Built in as Applications or as Use Guides for a Recommended Device AdditionAutism Solutions:These are solutions brought about by Dreamweaver House’s (A.L.L) approach, which constantly draws together the expert advice of, and works with an expanding volunteer coalition of, qualified American and internationally innovative and experienced MD’s, Neuroscientists, Behavioral Scientists, Researchers and Special Education Teachers.  These (A.L.L.) specialists cooperate in seeking effective solutions for autism.  They do so with a burning desire to be proactive in solving the puzzle and to improve the epidemic that is autism.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONSDoes Brain Retrain™ seek to replace other special education methods for autism?No!

Her career responsibilities, together with personally coordinating and supervising the daily,  almost 12 hour cycle of support staff for Christopher, makes Regina the ultimate ‘boots on the ground and go-to’ person, who has been directing Dreamweaver’s parents support inquiries and needs for most of its decade of community service.Karalee HarriganDirector of Mission Development and ProgramsCo- Founder Dreamweaver House Autism FoundationKaralee is a Magna Cum Laude graduate from the City of New York University, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology.  Subsequently, she worked for the New York City Department of Health as a School Health Coordinator, and later she became a Mental Health Counselor with Saint Vincent’s Hospital in Staten Island, New York. She joined the Len Anthony Studio as an associate producer of children’s movies and media, before becoming a Co-Founder of the Dreamweaver House Autism Foundation in 2006.  Karalee’s practice as the administrator of Dreamweaver Houses’ Energetic and Informational Protocols for autism is highlighted by her advanced certification in Bio-Modulation Therapy from the Tennant Institute in Texas.Len Anthony SmithFounder and Executive Director of DreamWeaver House Autism FoundationLen Anthony is a prolific producer, director and studio executive with an excellent multifaceted background in both the creative and business sides of the entertainment industries. In addition to writing, directing and producing motion pictures, stage plays music recordings and electronic media; he has also been an innovative and driving force in their marketing and distribution. He has had over two decades of service within the Hollywood Studio System of marketing and distribution. Within the entertainment industry he has served as the VP of International Marketing and subsequently as CEO of Studio Entertainment Corp. As Studio’s head of marketing he has traveled extensively producing, purchasing, distributing film and music products in such industry venues as the Cannes film festival, the Milfed film market in Italy, the Midem music market in France and the American film market in Hollywood. His tenure at Studio Entertainment has been featured in such publications as Billboard Magazine, The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, American Film, and Video Business.Len’s familiarity with the marketplace for children’s movies drew his attention to the seeming inability of the mainstream to stem the epidemic growth of autism. As a lifelong proponent of the practices and principles of naturopathic and energetic medicine, with training from the Pan American University of Natural medicine, he became increasingly passionate about the urgent need for alternative solutions in the care, treatment and education of autism’s children. In 2006 he founded and initially self-funded the Dreamweaver House Foundation.  In addition to bringing some of the brightest and most innovative international MDs, neuro scientists, behavioral scientists and educators together, to investigate alternative options in treatment and learning for autism, he has pioneered a revolutionary new concept of using children’s movies, utilizing a new and patented media technology, to teach, encourage and improve reading and language skills to children.Len Anthony’s academic background has steered him through a BA program in Theater and English and an Associate BSc in Photography, to a career launching fine arts degree in Film Production from the School of Visual Arts and his business initiating work in the graduate diploma program in Arts Management at Adelphi University.  In 2002 Len directed the new American drama ‘REFLECTIONS’, written by Joseph Koster. ‘REFLECTIONS’ opened Off- Broadway at New York's famed Cherry Lane Theater to rave reviews, as his tenure as a Director in the Actor’s Studio’s MFA program at New School University ended.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

I have mostly been involved in remote healing, and recently have been guided to begin work in a more direct fashion. I am being guided to reach out and share this method with more people, and it seems that the best way for people to learn about this is for me to go out into the world and physically meet with people.<br/><br/>I first developed a general tool to give people a way to work on themselves. Then I spent time expanding upon it, working out a lot of the details. It turned out to be a complex, mostly unknown system that - through extensive investigation and experimentation - I was able to simplify enough for the average person to use. I now want to share my efficient and simple translation of the complex system.<br/><br/><h3>A General Outline Of My System</h3>
<br/>First I enable in the person the ability to communicate with 'everything'. This includes their own body. I show them how they are going to be able to communicate with each part of their human body, and that these body parts will have the ability to communicate back to them. This is slightly similar to Kinesiology in how the body can respond, yet with my method the parts of the body will each have a voice of their own and will be able to speak and answer questions directed at them. This opens up the potential for gaining a whole lot of insight regarding physical ailments, ""hereditary"" diseases, pain, etc. <br/><br/>Just as many are beginning to realize that our ailments are a result of what we think and believe, more and more people are working with a healer. And many of those people will again need to make return visits for that same help, as the beneficial effects ""wear off"". What if you could now become aware of the specific beliefs that cause the ailment? And what if you had the tools to remove those underlying beliefs yourself?<br/><br/>The physical issues that this communication system allows one to address are truly amazing. However, the benefits are not limited to the physical alone. Imagine having the ability to communicate with your heart. For instance, it turns out that very many people are confused regarding what is their ""life calling"". They think that when someone says ""follow your heart"" it means to just do whatever their head tells them to do. Now they can specifically find out what their heart wants them to do, and by that, identify their true (or Heart's) purpose in life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>A small portion of abilities that can be gained from this system: <br/><br/>- The transformation and erasure of harmful beliefs.<br/><br/>- Healing of the self and others by touch.<br/><br/>- Healing of the self and others by thought.<br/><br/>- Comprehension of dream metaphoric language, along with the ability to apply this new understanding in ways that help with problem-solving and spiritual expansion.</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-Comprehension of fear and how it creates the external experience (what is often called karma).</span></div><div><br/></div><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div><div> <p>I am hoping to meet many people across the country who want to make a difference in the world. Provided that goals are met, the advanced perk ensures that I will visit your area (USA only) for an in person meetup. All healing work is free of charge, all basic training is free as well. I would ask that you invite any friends that are interested as the group experience helps to push your doubts to the side and become more comfortable with the experience. It also helps you form a local support group.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p>Because I was not happy with the common systems that create a reliance upon the healer, I wanted to develop a system to empower the individual and give them the ability to face their problems on a personal level.</p>
</div><div> <p>While each person trained becomes a power in their own right, I continue to bring information to light, which allows everyone involved to continue with advancements in understanding, if they choose to stay updated. I offer a free forum membership that functions as a support group.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p>I am fully self trained in the Arts. I have trained myself through my own guidance in methods commonly described as Regressive Hypnotherapy, Axiatonal Alignment, Energy Body Reconstruction, Quantum Touch, Interpersonal Reconstructive Therapy, etc. </p>
<p>My wife will join me with the touch healing form of work, and help with that area of training.</p>

It turned out to be a complex, mostly unknown system that - through extensive investigation and experimentation - I was able to simplify enough for the average person to use. I now want to share my efficient and simple translation of the complex system.A General Outline Of My System
First I enable in the person the ability to communicate with 'everything'. This includes their own body. I show them how they are going to be able to communicate with each part of their human body, and that these body parts will have the ability to communicate back to them. This is slightly similar to Kinesiology in how the body can respond, yet with my method the parts of the body will each have a voice of their own and will be able to speak and answer questions directed at them. This opens up the potential for gaining a whole lot of insight regarding physical ailments, ""hereditary"" diseases, pain, etc. Just as many are beginning to realize that our ailments are a result of what we think and believe, more and more people are working with a healer. And many of those people will again need to make return visits for that same help, as the beneficial effects ""wear off"". What if you could now become aware of the specific beliefs that cause the ailment? And what if you had the tools to remove those underlying beliefs yourself?The physical issues that this communication system allows one to address are truly amazing. However, the benefits are not limited to the physical alone. Imagine having the ability to communicate with your heart. For instance, it turns out that very many people are confused regarding what is their ""life calling"". They think that when someone says ""follow your heart"" it means to just do whatever their head tells them to do. Now they can specifically find out what their heart wants them to do, and by that, identify their true (or Heart's) purpose in life.A small portion of abilities that can be gained from this system: - The transformation and erasure of harmful beliefs.- Healing of the self and others by touch.- Healing of the self and others by thought.- Comprehension of dream metaphoric language, along with the ability to apply this new understanding in ways that help with problem-solving and spiritual expansion.-Comprehension of fear and how it creates the external experience (what is often called karma).
What We Need & What You Get
 I am hoping to meet many people across the country who want to make a difference in the world. Provided that goals are met, the advanced perk ensures that I will visit your area (USA only) for an in person meetup. All healing work is free of charge, all basic training is free as well. I would ask that you invite any friends that are interested as the group experience helps to push your doubts to the side and become more comfortable with the experience. It also helps you form a local support group.

The Impact
Because I was not happy with the common systems that create a reliance upon the healer, I wanted to develop a system to empower the individual and give them the ability to face their problems on a personal level.
 While each person trained becomes a power in their own right, I continue to bring information to light, which allows everyone involved to continue with advancements in understanding, if they choose to stay updated. I offer a free forum membership that functions as a support group.

    Challenges I am fully self trained in the Arts. I have trained myself through my own guidance in methods commonly described as Regressive Hypnotherapy, Axiatonal Alignment, Energy Body Reconstruction, Quantum Touch, Interpersonal Reconstructive Therapy, etc. 
My wife will join me with the touch healing form of work, and help with that area of training.


Other Ways You Can Help

 Spreading the word is a contribution in itself. Please share this in any way you can. Healing work is always offered for free, if you have a friend that has been seeking alternative methods, they are welcome to contact me. 


FeedbackThis is from our first hands on healing test (combined with the system I designed). This individual deals with Scoliosis and found my name listed on the Dolores Cannon website.:
""It has been feeling pretty good. I started skateboarding last week and it doesn't bother me like it used to. I have never felt stable enough to attempt getting on a skateboard. But I've been taking the dog to the park and rolling around. No tricks for me tho lol my back feels so much stronger than I ever remember it being in the past 14 yrs."" 
I do have a lot of feedback from remote healing. If you have questions feel free to contact me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Though, the concept of eBooks exists in the society but only
in a form that people scan books, create static PDFs and upload. The proper
eBook creation process is not followed because there is no such platform yet
which can display right-to-left languages’ text as easily as left-to-right’s.
Furthermore, interface of the platform in the same language is also needed.
Even further, the eBook creation process is lengthy and requires considerable
time, money and effort because of composing the manuscripts in digital form and
then using development techniques to generate optimized eBooks in the proper
epub format. Therefore the concept remains limited.</p>

</div></div>","The background


“Kitaab”, Urdu word for “book”, is a brainchild of “Ideal
Ideaz”, a software house founded by a group of friends, all sharing the same
vision to do something impact-ful for the society as well as themselves. 




Urdu is world’s 3rd biggest language* (mixed with
Hindi by some analytics) and is written right-to-left. Spoken primarily in
Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Middle-East and by the large community of Asian people living in US, UK, Canada and Australia. The language offers a
deep literary heritage and is considered as one of the sweetest languages in
the world. Unfortunately, the literature is dying because of the declining
trend of book reading which in turn is caused by rising prices of paper books
and decreasing affordability of people. eBooks can revive the book reading
habit by offering books which are,



Free (belonging to
public-domain or copyright free)


Paid but very cheap as
compared to paper-back editions


Easily accessible online


Easily readable giving the
best eReading experience


Encouraging amateur authors
to publish their works free of cost

Encouraging professional
authors to sell their books to a much larger audience around the globe



Though, the concept of eBooks exists in the society but only
in a form that people scan books, create static PDFs and upload. The proper
eBook creation process is not followed because there is no such platform yet
which can display right-to-left languages’ text as easily as left-to-right’s.
Furthermore, interface of the platform in the same language is also needed.
Even further, the eBook creation process is lengthy and requires considerable
time, money and effort because of composing the manuscripts in digital form and
then using development techniques to generate optimized eBooks in the proper
epub format. Therefore the concept remains limited.



The statistical analysis of such resources offering scanned
images as books show that the people do want to read eBooks but they are
helpless.




A static PDF can be “read”
but not “enjoyed”


PDF books are almost
impossible to read on mobile devices


There is no dedicated
mobile app for Urdu eBooks reading, having the interface language in Urdu too


Available collection is not
very vast, specially the classic literature


In scanned images, you do
not have the customization features offered by eBooks (font style, size, color,
line height, spacing, background color, day mode, night mode etc.)

Due to piracy, authors and
publishers remain hesitant


So we develop Kitaab
Kitaab is a complete eReading and ePublishing solution for not only Urdu but all right-to-left (RTL) languages. 



Scope includes, 



Free Android and iOS app
optimized for RTL eBooks reading


ePublishing mechanism by
which Urdu books will be made available in industry standard EPUB format


Generating a vast library
of FREE eBooks belonging to public-domain and copyright free


Digital Rights Management
(DRM) system to handle piracy on copyrighted books


Platform for publishers and
authors to sell their books in ebook form


Translation of other
languages masterpieces to Urdu, thus bridging the societies


Primary interface language
as Urdu, secondary language English


English eBooks can also be
read with as much ease as Urdu


Exciting social sharing
features not yet offered by any eReading app


Expanding the horizons to
include other RTL languages like Arabic and Persian

Following several visits to Africa, Sue and Henry realised the challenges African children face to learn and they became passionate about transforming their life chances. In England, children are very fortunate to have an abundance of books and to be surrounded by stimulating, colourful and well-resourced schools and classrooms. In Africa the situation is quite the opposite:</span><br/></p><ul><li>Of Africa's nearly 128 million school-aged children, only half have the opportunity to attend school and learn basic skills.</li></ul><ul><li>An estimated 37 million African children learn so little while in school that they are hardly better off than peers who never went to school.</li></ul><ul><li>More than 90% of African children who attend school have never owned a book of their own.</li></ul><ul><li>Teachers use a ‘chalk-and-talk’ method of teaching a class of up to 60 pupils. This is a valid teaching method but only 78% of schools have blackboards and less than 50% of schools have chalk.</li></ul><div>
<p>Within a few months of setting up, PGL had filled a garage with old textbooks, story books, stationery and laptops kindly donated by schools in the UK. Now they have collected more than 500,000 essential books from over 500 schools and individuals across UK, which are ready to be shipped to Africa. PGL's next goal is to ship a container of 100,000 books to pupils in nursery and primary schools in Ghana and to set up 3 mobile libraries in communities which have limited access to books or lack the funds to build a permanent library.</p>

</div><br/></div>","Education Crisis in Africa: In School, But Without BooksPromoting Global Learning (PGL) is a UK charity (Registration Number: 1158202) established in 2014, by Sue Gerrish and Henry Yentumi, with a vision to raise the standard of education in Africa. Following several visits to Africa, Sue and Henry realised the challenges African children face to learn and they became passionate about transforming their life chances. In England, children are very fortunate to have an abundance of books and to be surrounded by stimulating, colourful and well-resourced schools and classrooms. In Africa the situation is quite the opposite:Of Africa's nearly 128 million school-aged children, only half have the opportunity to attend school and learn basic skills.An estimated 37 million African children learn so little while in school that they are hardly better off than peers who never went to school.More than 90% of African children who attend school have never owned a book of their own.Teachers use a ‘chalk-and-talk’ method of teaching a class of up to 60 pupils. This is a valid teaching method but only 78% of schools have blackboards and less than 50% of schools have chalk.
Within a few months of setting up, PGL had filled a garage with old textbooks, story books, stationery and laptops kindly donated by schools in the UK. Now they have collected more than 500,000 essential books from over 500 schools and individuals across UK, which are ready to be shipped to Africa. PGL's next goal is to ship a container of 100,000 books to pupils in nursery and primary schools in Ghana and to set up 3 mobile libraries in communities which have limited access to books or lack the funds to build a permanent library.


Help us to set up three Mobile Libraries for children of the Upper West Akim District in Ghana
We are getting ready to ship more than 100,000 books to Ghana and to distribute our educational materials through 3 mobile library vehicles. These libraries will provide services to disadvantaged schools in the Upper West Akim District of Ghana and aim to ignite a passion for learning, reading and exploring among local children.

Upper West Akim District is located in Eastern region of Ghana and has a total population of 97,950. 
65% of the working population is engaged in agriculture and their income levels are extremely low.
There are 167 public schools available at the basic level. The total number of students at school is 19,811 with approximately 15,000 students in nursery and primary schools.
13 primary schools are operating under trees; and a further 10 primary schools and 8 junior high schools have no permanent classroom blocks.
The pass rate for Maths is 27% and for English is 22%, 11 schools have a zero percent (0%) pass rate. 




To make this happen, we need to raise £60,000:

Your contribution will make an enormous difference in the lives of thousands of children in Ghana. The fund will be used for:



Shipping: £3,000 - Shipping a container of 100,000 books from UK to Ghana.

Mobile Library Vehicles: £34,000 - Purchasing 3 second-hand Transit type vans in good condition: each costs around £11,300.

Interior Design: £4,800 - Designing, shelving and colouring  expenses to decorate the vans and turn them into to 3 efficient and friendly mobile libraries.

Annual Staff Salary: £3,200 - Hiring 3 drivers and 3 librarians.

Staff Training: £1,500 - Organising training for our staff and volunteers. We plan to engage 2 volunteers per community.

Annual Fuel Cost: £5,400 -  Average monthly fuel expense per vehicle is around £150.

Repair & Maintenance: £2,100 - Average annual repair & maintenance cost of £700 per vehicle.

Annual Insurance: £1,000 - Insuring 3 mobile library vans.

Annual Storage & Garage: £5,000 - Renting a storage unit for books and a garage for the mobile library vans.

If you help us to meet our goal, your kindness will not go unnoticed or unrewarded. Please check out the right rail for the packages of authentic African perks you could receive as a way of saying thank you for your vital contribution.

<p>When I was five years old my favorite thing in the World was drawing monsters. Many years later my mother handed me a stack of those original childhood drawings and I saw something magical in those early creations. I cast 6 of those monsters as the “<i>ScrapKins</i>” and created a story about a tribe of creatures that build a world out of the things we throw away. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457296589/wqy2oxmkxzanwc8h6jgy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Combining my years of experience working with The Jim Henson Company and designing educational products and toys for kids, I created the <b>ScrapKins Recycled Arts School</b> to get kids ages ages 5–10 years old to see the creative potential in everyday objects. From milk carton pirate ships to cardboard tube dinosaurs, the ScrapKins guide children to ""re-think"" junk and awaken the creative process. <br/>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457292286/qxujddpkhptypdfdjcms.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><i>ScrapKins: Junk Re-Thunk</i></b>  is our 2nd book and the definitive guide to the ScrapKins. It includes 80 full-color color pages of comics, biographies of the six ScrapKins, puzzles, and illustrated instructions for 24 recycled-art projects kids can create using stuff found in almost every home. This book represents a journey I’ve been on my whole life to create things that kids treasure. This is the book I wanted when I was seven. A manual, a friend, an invitation to unlock creativity, and a secret glimpse into the wonder that still exists in the World. </p>
<p></p>

The tour is the best way to reach as many kids and families as

<p>Everyone should be able to feel the pride in making something, to experience the joy of creating art. Making stuff fuels the imagination, sparks the brain to solve problems and empowers kids to gain confidence in creation. And art shouldn't require special tools. That's why all of the ScrapKins projects are made from common household recyclables. That's the underlying message: We should use what we have and begin to engage kids in conversation about why recycling is important and where our trash goes.<br/></p>
I feel honored to be able to share this message with children. This is why I’m here. I've been building the ScrapKins for 10 years but it's really something I've been creating my whole life. This is my gift to the Universe. To you. To your kids. To your friend’s kids. To your nieces, nephews, step-siblings, grandchildren and anyone who always wanted to be creative but didn’t know how.  You already have the tools and materials. The ScrapKins are your guide.  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457296112/roleqjiy6tg1vvgjyotw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","When I was five years old my favorite thing in the World was drawing monsters. Many years later my mother handed me a stack of those original childhood drawings and I saw something magical in those early creations. I cast 6 of those monsters as the “ScrapKins” and created a story about a tribe of creatures that build a world out of the things we throw away. 

Combining my years of experience working with The Jim Henson Company and designing educational products and toys for kids, I created the ScrapKins Recycled Arts School to get kids ages ages 5–10 years old to see the creative potential in everyday objects. From milk carton pirate ships to cardboard tube dinosaurs, the ScrapKins guide children to ""re-think"" junk and awaken the creative process. 


ScrapKins: Junk Re-Thunk  is our 2nd book and the definitive guide to the ScrapKins. It includes 80 full-color color pages of comics, biographies of the six ScrapKins, puzzles, and illustrated instructions for 24 recycled-art projects kids can create using stuff found in almost every home. This book represents a journey I’ve been on my whole life to create things that kids treasure. This is the book I wanted when I was seven. A manual, a friend, an invitation to unlock creativity, and a secret glimpse into the wonder that still exists in the World. 





The tour is the best way to reach as many kids and families as 
possible with the ScrapKins mission of creativity through 
resourcefulness. By visiting schools, museums and bookstores across the 
US, we get the opportunity to empower kids with the joy and wonder of creating 
art from junk. 



In each city we visit, we have 3 goals:
Visit 2–3 Schools for an assembly or workshop about the ScrapKins 

Visit 1–2 Bookstores to talk about the book and teach a project to kids
Create a Pop-up Recycled Workshop at a museum, festival or public space


CITIES WE ARE SCHEDULED TO VISIT* (so far):

New York City: April 3–9 + Book Launch Party, April 2
Washington, DC/Baltimore:  April 10–17
Rochester, NY:  April 18–22
Boston, MA:  April 23–27
Philadelphia, PA:  May 2– 8


CITIES FOR FALL 2016 (exact dates TBD): 

Atlanta, GA
Chapel Hill, NC
New Orleans, LA
Austin, TX


*For each $800 we earn above our goal, we can add another US city to the Tour! We’d like to go around the world, and with your help, we can do it! 






Hiring a publicist: This is our biggest expense to help reach out to local media and arrange bookstore and school visits in
 each of the cities we visit 

Travel expenses: Airfare, rental cars and food
Shipping and perk fulfillment

Everyone should be able to feel the pride in making something, to experience the joy of creating art. Making stuff fuels the imagination, sparks the brain to solve problems and empowers kids to gain confidence in creation. And art shouldn't require special tools. That's why all of the ScrapKins projects are made from common household recyclables. That's the underlying message: We should use what we have and begin to engage kids in conversation about why recycling is important and where our trash goes.
I feel honored to be able to share this message with children. This is why I’m here. I've been building the ScrapKins for 10 years but it's really something I've been creating my whole life. This is my gift to the Universe. To you. To your kids. To your friend’s kids. To your nieces, nephews, step-siblings, grandchildren and anyone who always wanted to be creative but didn’t know how.  You already have the tools and materials. The ScrapKins are your guide.

<p>Benjamin Denen graduated from the prestigious Belmont University in Nashville, TN with a degree in Commercial Music Guitar Performance.  While living in Nashville he toured extensively throughout the US playing a variety of styles of music sharing the stage with some of the industries top stars.

He eventually left Nashville to serve as a youth pastor, earning a Master's Degree in Youth Ministry Leadership from Huntington University.  </p>
<p>Tessa Denen, who grew up in Pendleton, also attended Belmont University studying Music Business. On the business side of the industry, she has worked events with some of today's top country artists, worked in artist development, and also as a booking agent.</p>
<p>The two married two years after meeting in Nashville and have been dreaming of opening a music school for as long as they can remember.  Their combined skill sets and passions led them to believe that this will be a great venture and one from which the community of Pendleton could benefit.</p>

$4,000- launch our e-commerce site and develop our first set of inventory, the proceeds from which will be giving to our educational partners who are providing educational and work placement support for refugees.
$1,000- to cover a portion of our travel expenses to compete for $1M in funding in the Hult Prize competition in London.
If we don’t reach our $5,000 goal, we will fulfill our perk obligations as much as possible, and any remaining donations will be given to our educational partners.What You Get: About our JewelryOur perks include a variety of pendant necklace options, ranging from stainless steel to customizable gold plated. Each pendant comes with a necklace cord and has handmade touches. Ultimately, we strive to have each piece designed or handcrafted by refugees from around the world, but today we're taking it one step at a time, so your piece may be handcrafted in our hometown in Upstate New York.Risks & ChallengesWe recognize that launching any initiative can be risky business. Artemis’ biggest risks lie in ensuring we can drive enough sales of accessories to cover our costs and support our educational partners. A crowdfunding campaign is one strategy we are taking to reduce this risk. The Artemis team is comprised for four experienced business professionals whose goal is to see Artemis succeed so that it can make as much impact as possible.Other Ways You Can HelpCan’t donate at this time?

<h2>The challenge</h2>

<p>We all have mountains to climb in life. Whether it’s a mountain of rock or one of troubles and disbelief, the challenges are there every day for us to fight and overcome. </p>
<p>And while some of us may get help along the way, for underprivileged children this climb starts early and with stones tied to their feet.</p>
<p>This year, I have decided to combine my passion for supporting education with my passion for nature (and trekking) and started this fundraising campaign that I hope you will support. </p>
<p>Between the 1st and 7th of October, I will attempt to climb Kilimanjaro (5895m), while raising funds for Teach for Romania. I am doing this to help underprivileged children get access to education,  increasing their chances of escaping poverty. Climbing the highest freestanding mountain in the world symbolises the struggles those children have when trying to succeed in life. </p>
<p><strong>My target is to raise £1 for every meter of the total ascent, £5895 in total. </strong></p>
<p><strong>I will fund the entire climbing part/logistics of the expedition myself, therefore all the money raised in this campaign will go directly to Teach for Romania to support teaching of underprivileged children in rural communities.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>What are the main issues we are trying to solve?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Student motivation:</strong> According to the most recent international education study performed by PISA (OECD), Romanian students are the least motivated to study of all students from a group of 65 countries analysed. Other recent international studies demonstrate that Romania’s education system ranks towards the bottom of both European and global rankings.</p>
<p><strong>School drop-out rates:</strong> Romania has a 17.4% average drop-out rate, compared to 12.8% which is the European Union average. This is more pronounced in the rural than the urban communities, however the figures are slowly increasing in both sub-categories.</p>
<p><strong>High school graduation rates:</strong> Among students who remain in school through the 12th grade, only 56% passed the national high school graduation exam (""Bacalaureat"") in 2013, latest data available. The figures above, as well as others published in recent years, demonstrate that Romania suffers from an overall lack of quality education as well as an inequality of access.</p>

<p>Teach for Romania has had a tremendous success over the past few years since its inception in Romania in 2014 and continues to grow - since last year, the number of teachers in the program and the number of schools has grown. We now have 87 primary and secondary school teachers in 72 schools and high schools in 12 counties. (3rd &amp; 4th generation of teachers and Alumni that chose to continue teaching) This year’s aim is to focus on the organization’s sustainability, curriculum development and increase the overall quality of the programme.</p>

<h3><strong>What are the risks involved?</strong></h3>

</div></div>","The challenge

We all have mountains to climb in life. Whether it’s a mountain of rock or one of troubles and disbelief, the challenges are there every day for us to fight and overcome. 
And while some of us may get help along the way, for underprivileged children this climb starts early and with stones tied to their feet.
This year, I have decided to combine my passion for supporting education with my passion for nature (and trekking) and started this fundraising campaign that I hope you will support. 
Between the 1st and 7th of October, I will attempt to climb Kilimanjaro (5895m), while raising funds for Teach for Romania. I am doing this to help underprivileged children get access to education,  increasing their chances of escaping poverty. Climbing the highest freestanding mountain in the world symbolises the struggles those children have when trying to succeed in life. 
My target is to raise £1 for every meter of the total ascent, £5895 in total. 
I will fund the entire climbing part/logistics of the expedition myself, therefore all the money raised in this campaign will go directly to Teach for Romania to support teaching of underprivileged children in rural communities.

 

The Reason
 
What is Teach for Romania, their mission and their values?

As most of you know by now, education has always been an important part of my life and I would like to continue to give back in the best way I can, by promoting good education and making it available to those communities that need it the most.

The education and qualification that a child receives, as well as the environment that he develops in, are crucial for the opportunities that he would have later on.
The teachers at Teach for Romania promote an education based on strong solid values, broadening their pupils life choices and horizon.


 
 
The Trip
 
Mount Kilimanjaro
In the wild northern reaches of Tanzania, a snow-capped giant rises majestically above the African plains and savannah, as iconic as it is unfathomable, the roof of Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro.

At 5895 meters tall, this dormant volcano is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest freestanding mountain in the world. For more than a hundred and twenty years, this astonishing natural wonder has drawn climbers from all over the world and is listed as one of the world’s great 7 summits. Kilimanjaro is famous for its incredible biodiversity, which covers almost all the ecological systems known to man. from lush rain forests, to alpine desserts and the famous artic summit.

<p><strong>Who are we? </strong></p>
<p>Good Kenyan is a Social Enterprise that aims to empower, transform and engage high school leavers in a four month program. The program has a set curriculum in basic IT, Personal Finance, Entrepreneurship and Life Skills. To empower them economically, we teach them how to make cards, bags and gift boxes from recycled materials and earn once the items are sold. We will also offer one on one mentor-ship and motivation talks.</p>
<p><strong>What are we trying to achieve? </strong></p>
<p> To contribute to the eradication of poverty, as well as to a positive and healthy society by transforming and empowering it’s youth through our program. We seek to fill the gap that exists between completion of high school and the commencement of tertiary education. Currently in Kenya, there is no formal system to engage youth during this formative stage that affects the rest of their adult lives and should be well guided.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we doing it?</strong></p>
<p>Good Kenyan was founded out of Lucy Chepchumba’s own life experience. Having lost her mother before completing high school, she stayed with relatives and was idle for a big part of the year. She also did not have help in choosing her career or clear guidance in life issues such as personal finance or workplace preparedness. Lucy promised herself that she would offer someone else this guidance once she established herself. Her co-founder, Humphrey Kayange, is a long-time friend and Olympian rugby player for the Kenya team who wants to give back to his country. Out of a shared vision to give a helping hand to the next generation of Kenyans, our social enterprise was born.</p>
<p>Kenyan youth are often idle on completion of high school making them easy targets for crime, abuse of alcohol and drugs or unhealthy sexual behaviours. Our project aims to engage them positively during this transition period. Youth unemployment levels remain high so we are offering a solution to this. The need for the use of recycled material has become an environmental issue and Kenya has issued a ban on plastic packaging so our recycled products are sustainable and attractive to the market.</p>
<p>Mentorship and coaching is our greatest pillar as we pair the youth with career and life mentors through our networks to ensure they learn from experience.</p>
<p><strong>How will we use your contribution?</strong></p>
<p>It will help us purchase second-hand computers, industrial blenders, a screen printer, and purchase raw materials. Your contribution will enable us to pay trainers, facilitate mentoring, provide for the overall running of the project and feed the cohorts for four months in session. We anticipate needing $8500 to have a successful second program for 10 cohorts. If we don't meet our funding goal, we will soldier on with the limited resources we have as we continue fundraising and selling products.</p>
<p><strong>What other ways can you help?</strong></p>
<p>Donate a computer, industrial blender, screen printer, white board or your training expertise.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at how we have done so far. If you like what you read, please consider a donation to help us run our 2nd program!</p>
<p><strong>Cohort 1- Program Pilot</strong></p>
<p>Our program runs for 4 months and each group is referred to as cohort. We launched on 30th April 2017 starting with 10 young people who successfully completed on 15th September 2017. The cohort commenced with ten youth recruited from Dreams children’s home, neighboring communities of Kerarapon, Vet Slums and Ngong town. We used churches and the local administration to spread the word. Twenty five youth turned up for an interview, out of which we selected ten based on their needs and demonstration of willingness to learn.</p>
<p>During the business and entrepreneurship classes, the youth learnt how to make packaging from recycled materials, life skills and attended IT classes. We have also partnered each youth with a career and life mentor from our networks and friends of Good Kenyan.</p>
<p>Beyond attending the program, each youth was encouraged to select a community project to undertake by end of the program. These projects are facilitated by Good Kenyan and once a month they mentor high school students from the local schools.</p>
<p>Our current challenges include: only four computers in a class of 10 that the youth share during the IT classes and an open air workshop which makes it difficult to conduct classes in cold and rainy weather. We also do not have many of the materials and equipment we require to support highly interactive learning sessions such as interactive screens and projectors. Additionally, most of our training is offered on a pro-bono basis and sometimes the trainers do not honor the schedule due to competing priorities. Finally, we require a greater supply of raw materials and other equipment such as screen printers to increase production of the packaging materials.</p>
