<div>We are looking for ALL of you… YOU who will never, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ever</span>, be in the IN CROWD to help us make a music video for this song.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>IN CROWD is all about standing up for the outcasts, the bullied, anyone who has ever felt like they don't fit in.  And it's about celebrating the different… and occasionally humorous… things that make us unique.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've been so blown away by your response to this song, all the photos and comments you've been posting and emails you have sent us.  We believe more than ever that the world needs to hear this message.  So we're asking for you to help us make the best, most impacting music video we've ever released.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT ARE WE ASKING FOR?</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>We have developed some crazy cool ideas for this video and put together a budget with an LA-based crew who will produce the clip for us.  It's not a huge budget compared to the $500,000+ spent on most major-label videos, but we are confident for that $15,000 we can create something we can all be proud of, that you will want to share with your friends, and will encourage so many people who feel ""out"" of the crowd.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We need you guys to donate whatever you can afford - from $10 to $10,000.  There are a bunch of different incentives listed in the side column… we're super excited about the T-shirt design using all the IN CROWD photos and images you've been sending us.  And there are some other fun ones there too:  try your hand as <strong>Band Stylist</strong>, bring a <strong>Ruckus House Party</strong> to your place, or get some friends together and encourage one of your mates by giving them a day <strong>On Tour</strong> with us!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>No money?  Already donated and don't know what to do next?  We want <strong>as many people as possible</strong> to hear about this song, this video, this movement.  Please share our project page on your Facebook, Twitter, email your friends… And we have the IN CROWD (live) download still available <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">absolutely free</span> at <a href=""http://www.raptureruckus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.raptureruckus.com</a>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're creating SONICBOOST STUDIO, a high quality home recording studio where local artists can create a quality album at an affordable rate.  We need your help to make it possible to keep our rates very low and help to foster the local music scene.</p>
<p>My name is Eric Myers.  I manage a high end recording studio here in Raleigh, NC - <a href=""http://www.puremixstudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.puremixstudios.com</a></p>
<p>The rates at PureMix are already pretty reasonable considering the level of quality we provide.  The room there was designed by Wes Lachot, and we have an SSL console, as well as a pile of incredible outboard gear.  However, there are still many artists who can't afford even our deepest discounted rate of $50/hr at PureMix.</p>
<p>SONICBOOST STUDIO will exist in the basement of my home where we can help musicians create music with some very good equipment and skilled engineers starting at $25/hr!</p>
<p><strong>REWARDS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>T-Shirts!</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>STUDIO TIME! </strong> We think this is pretty genius.   We are also making studio time available as a reward.  Even if you are not interested in the studio time, you could buy some studio time and donate THAT to an artist you believe in!</li>
</ul>
<p>We already have the equipment needed to record, edit and mix great sounding albums because of the generosity of our partner studio PureMix Studios.  We are thinking of SONICBOOST STUDIO as sort of a ""B"" room for PureMix.  We are keeping the overhead extremely low by building out a room in our basement, and we are also able utilize the portable equipment that we use for our ""on location"" recordings as the majority of the platform for SONICBOOST STUDIO.</p>
<p>In order to keep our rates low, we need your help with final construction costs in order to finish the basement area in such a way that the rooms will be isolated from each other and to create an acoustically appropriate environment for tracking and some light duty mixing.</p>
<p>Final mixes for larger budget projects can always be completed at PureMix, but for demo budget projects we will need to make the acoustics in the environment at SONICBOOST STUDIO correct enough to complete a demo quality mix.</p>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of $5000 to complete construction here in the basement for approximately 300 square feet of space to isolate from the upper floor, stud the walls, install electrical, HVAC, and electrical work.  Some of this work has already been completed, and the money we raise through this project will complete the remaining construction tasks.</p>
<p>If we ""overfund"" through this Kickstarter we will put the additional funds towards additional studio equipment to expand our capabilities.</p>
Remaining budget needs breakdown:<br/><ul>
<li>Electrical - $750</li>
<li>Framing/Insulation - $2000</li>
<li>Drywall/Painting/Flooring/Finishing (doors/light fixtures etc) - $2250</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will be like a scholarship fund for many local artists helping to keep our hourly rate costs WAY down.  There are already many artists and bands lined up and waiting to take advantage of our low rates and expertise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to give PLEASE help by sharing the links and spreading the word.  Use the Indiegogo SHARE tools!  Tell a friend personally about it.  Talk about it over lunch tomorrow!</p>

<h2><em>How Did We Get Here? </em></h2>
<p>Straw &amp; Hay is a raw, two-piece band that originates from Lexington, Ky. The band consists of Shane Allan Smith and Joshua Hollis Doss and started from a urge and need to play ""loud"" music. After one jam session it was evident that it was a start of a beautiful friendship and passionate tunes. One year later Straw &amp; Hay is going to be miles apart with Shane moving to PHILADELPHIA for grad school, and Josh is staying in Lexington to finish up obtaining his undergrad degree. The reason this campaign is so important is due to the fact that Straw &amp; Hay will be on hiatus for awhile and this collection of songs entitled, ""Princess Motel"" was recorded with the sole purpose of keeping the music alive for the time being. The ten song album is tentatively scheduled to be released on September 1st with help from our fans!  </p>
<h2><em><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET:</strong></em></h2>
<p>Over the past year Straw &amp; Hay have worked extremely hard in writing music that is very personal and dear to both. Much has gone on and hard times produce beautiful art and we want to be able to share and hopefully inspire others. In order for this project to be completed we need help to do so. With Shane and Josh both in college and the high expenses of mastering and producing a record it is necessary and unfortunate that we must ask and reach out to all of you for help. With a goal of $1,000 we intend to be able to fund the production and mastering costs associated with producing an album, the album which was recorded in two long nights is all but finished with only the mastering and production to be completed. </p>
<p>However through your help you will not be left empty handed  Through some of the perks we have made available and the wonderful ability of Shane Smith to create not only music, but imaginative and beautiful art there are some very fine objects to be earned. Whether it's the limite edition art prints and t-shirts hand designed by Shane, personalized covers or songs or just a plain ole copy of the album we hope that there is something for you! We also will take any recommendations that might be unique to you and not listed as a perk but there are always exceptions! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact of Helping Straw &amp; Hay Finish ""PRINCESS MOTEL"":</h2>
<p>With this album so near and dear to our hearts we really hope that not only is this completing an album but it's helping Shane and Josh reach their dream of finishing an album that has taken a lot of hard work and late nights to record. It will also help to set in stone a piece of work that will hold as a bridge between Shane and Josh's hiatus and hopefully the next step in furthering our love of music. We hope you will find the same joy in this project that we have found and that you will find a way to help us complete our dream! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help:</h2>
<p>We also encourage you to help spread the word and to get the word out on the streets about this project. Even if you have no means to donate (which we totally understand) you can still tell others and help get the campaign out to the masses. Any way you may feel the need or desire to help we beyond appreciate  So with that being said thank you and may God Bless you! </p>

<h3>Umculo's 2013 Fairy Queen</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.capefestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.capefestival.com</a></p>
<p>Umculo/ Cape Festival is an international organisation that supports lasting social change through opera in South Africa. Our dedicated team of top professionals donates its time and effort to a project to which all of us are passionately committed. We believe that the future of opera can be found in South Africa.</p>
<p>Singing is part of everyday life in South Africa - more than anywhere else in the world. Thousands of choirs in schools, churches, community halls and even prisons bear living witness to this tradition.</p>
<p>This is the starting-point for Umculo, a name which means both music and reconciliation. </p>
<p>Our team organises workshops in Township schools.  Scenic interpretation is the decisive step towards more self-awareness and social consciousness; both sides learn equally from encounter and exchange.</p>
<p>The highlight each year is a full opera production with young South African singers and musicians and a choir from the Townships. </p>
<p>We urgently need your support for this unique project.</p>
<p>Our project already receives generous support from the Hilti Foundation and the Goethe Institut.  But neither organisation is able to cover all of our costs, and we urgently need an extra EURO 25 000 in the next three weeks to enable our opera to reach the stage.</p>
<p>We believe that Umculo can achieve in opera a revolution comparable to that of Venezeula's El Sistema for the symphony orchestra.  With the right support, we can grow and expand.  Not only can we touch hundreds of thousands of young lives in South Africa; we can also help the rest of the world to learn from South Africa just how much social impact can be achieved when opera is conceived as participation and grown from communities.  </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Umculo's 2013 Fairy Queen team includes:</p>
<p>- Founder and director Shirley Apthorp, Cape Town-born music journalist for the Financial Times;</p>
<p>- Baritone Njabulo Madlala, winner of the 2010 Kathleen Ferrier Award;</p>
<p>- Catherine Milliken, head of the Berlin Philharmonic's education programme from 2005 to 2012;</p>
<p>- German stage director Robert Lehmeier;</p>
<p>- Award-winning costume designer Thando Lobese;</p>
<p>- Violinist Stefano Pagliano, concertmaster of the orchestra of the orchestra of La Scala, Milan;</p>
<p>- Vienna-based conductor Warwick Stengards;</p>
<p>- Education team: Ntando Cele, Lea Heinrich, Marion Haak</p>
<p>- The choir of Bloekombos Secondary School, conducted by Siyabulela Sulelo;</p>
<p>- Singers Angela Kerrison, July Zuma, Mlamli Lalapantsi, Melissa Gerber, Sandile Mabaso, Ronald Paseka, and Brenda Thulo</p>
<p>- Production team Tatjana Dachsel, Laura Ellersdorfer, Michael Maxwell.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The EURO 25000 we need is essential for providing transport and school lunches for workshop participants. Our education workshops, which build tomorrow's opera audiences, give talented young singers a first-hand understanding of performance, and build social skills, are absolutely fundamental to Umculo's aims.  The funds will also cover transport and daily costs for our young orchestra members and chorus.</p>
<p>By supporting us, you become part of this exciting new venture.</p>
<p>Depending on the size of your donation, you can secure your own tickets to our performances, original photographs of the performance, an individually-designed photo book of the production, a Fairy Queen t-shirt, a poster, and/ or an exclusive invitation to attend our closing party.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our full goal, we will still provide as many workshops as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the three years since it was founded, Umculo has reached hundreds of young South Africans and gained international press attention and financial support.  We believe opera can change lives, and our young participants are the living testimony to this fact. Opera develops self-awareness and social consciousness, and provides a vital aesthetic experience.</p>

<p>As you know, I'm a guy from a small town in Tennessee who had the crazy idea to pursue a music career in NYC. This journey has brought me some wonderful experiences/memories: sharing the stage with people like Norah Jones, John Forte, Me'Shell Ndegeocello; becoming the lead singer for world-renown director/choreographer Bill T. Jones and performing his tribute at the Kennedy Center for Pres. Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah, Paul McCartney, et al, touring cities in the U.S. and Europe, landing singing for a national commercial, getting features about my music on CBS News, in Ebony Magazine, and working with some of the most talented singers/songwriters and musicians in NYC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As they say, half of being lucky is just being there...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since my tour in Europe last Summer (Berlin, Cologne, Brussels, London, Paris, Den Haag &amp; Amsterdam), I've been getting messages and calls  asking me when I would be able to come back to Europe to begin moving forward with opportunities to grow my career. Meetings with publishing companies, licensing companies, booking agents, and more recently, club managers, radio stations, and festival managers have all surfaced and I just need to be there to make things happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's time to build on this momentum. I've been doing so much of it on my own, and I'm thankful for that because I've grown so much, and I thank you for all your support, too. But, I'm now at the point in my career where I need to build my team (booking agent, manager, publishing, record label, distribution, etc) ; I need to solidify my ground game to spread my music &amp; expand my reach (street teams, local booking &amp; cross-pollinating for events and causes); and I need it to be global because if given the proper chance, I know my music can connect people, it can give context, it can unify, it can be fun, and it can allow us to open up a little bit more - that's my vision for my career...and here's how you can help.</p>

<p>Welcome! <br/>I am very thankful for the time you are spending reading this.</p>
<p>My name is Moana Avvenenti. I am a 23-year old singer and songwriter from Saint-Martin, Caribbean. In 2009, I moved to Boston, Massachusetts to attend Berklee College of Music. In my 7 semesters there, I studied with some of the best faculty in the world, and I worked with the most gifted musicians I had ever met. After graduating, and years of performing in cover bands, I am finally focusing on my career as an original artist.</p>
<p>Throughout the past 4 years, I have confectioned many songs, and I have selected 13 of them that I am now hoping to bring to life. <br/>Each song reflects the uniqueness of my cultural background from a different light. And in addition to my own experiences, the talented multi-cultural musicians that I'm working with (Berklee faculty, students and alumni from all over the world) are helping to bring even more variety and colors to my music! <br/>Now, the time has come to record and assemble these pieces of music into an album.</p>
<p>So, let's attack this project from the problematic part. <br/>$10,000!?!?! <br/>Yes, you read that right. <br/>I know this may seem like a magnanimous sum at first. Trust me, that’s how I felt, too! <br/>But if you break it down like I did with my production team, you'll come to realize that we actually cut down on a lot of expenses.</p>
<p>Here's where the money will go:</p>
<p>Studio: $1500<br/>Musicians: $3500<br/>Production: $3500 <br/>Manufacturing/Distribution: $1500</p>
<p>As an artist, depending on this much money to create my project is not a comfortable feeling. <br/>It is scary to think that my art could never be born because of economical reasons.</p>
<p>This is why I need your help.<br/>But not only your financial contribution:<br/>I want to add you and your own colors to the team, too!</p>
<p>Once you are on board, I will send you videos, photos and messages throughout the whole process, to ask you for your advice and feedback.<br/>Your opinion will be considered for every step and every decision, and you will get access to the behind the scenes of how to make an album. <br/>We will film just about everything, so it will be like you are there with us along the way!</p>
<p>The more people that I get to be involved in this, the more chances I have to record the album, but also to make it a good one, at that!</p>
<p>We can only make this together! <br/>Then, you can tell your grandchildren how you have taken part into the making of a record.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much. Every bit helps and I am completely and whole-heartdely appreciative of every act of generosity. </p></div>","Hola!

<p>Dear Supporters,</p>
<p>I have embarked on a very monumental journey in my life. I have decided to start my solo music project in hopes of branching out and making a successful career out of the music I make. One of the first steps on this journey is recording the material I have written. I have decided to work with Ethan Kaufmann in Los Angeles, California to record this new EP and distribute it to all of you beautiful people. However, this process does not come at a low cost. Being that I must travel to Los Angeles and spend quite a lot of money during the recording process, I will need a lot of financial support to make the project successful. I would be so incredibly appreciative for anybody that could contribute financially to this project, even if just one dollar. As you can see, there are rewards depending on the amount of money you donate. This opportunity is a dream come true for me, and to have all of my supporters involved in the process would mean the absolute world.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support,</p>

<p>The song ""Daddy's Girl"" is about a girl's experience of her father leaving her, among other things. The video will not necessarily interpret that experience exactly, but will instead concentrate on the theme of abandonment. </p>
<p>The video centres around two girls on the brink of adolescence. All on their own, the girls drift through abandoned drive-ins, play baseball in empty parks, make pets out of 'live bait' worms, and allow themselves to become hypnotized by race cars circling around a track. After all their wandering, they finally arrive at the water - the edge of the world - at sunset. Here they meet Falcon Jane who adorns them with floral crowns and warrior paint. Together they play along the shoreline until the sun sets, bringing their last day of childhood freedom to a close before the reality of adulthood sets in.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>About Falcon Jane &amp; Take Off</strong></p>
<p>Released on <span class=""aBn""><span class=""aQJ"">October 19th</span></span> was Falcon Jane’s full-length album Take Off, which is a beautiful mix of rhythms that draws you in and does not disappoint. Ms. Jane describes the album as being about “loss in all its forms. It’s about running away from both the good and the bad. I tried to take all the negative feelings I had of fear, hatred, loneliness, worthlessness, and abandonment, turn them into something positive through music, and distance myself from them.” Take Off is a haunting assortment of sounds, lyrics and raw emotions that will have listeners enter into a dreamlike world of storytelling. It’s a simple yet dynamic mixture of talent from Hayden Farrar on bass and Laura Conning singing backing vocals. Described by Ms. Falcon Jane herself: “My music is a way for me to capture the present and all the emotions, happenings and bullshit that seems to go along with it and to preserve it so that it can be interpreted and understood by those who care to listen.”</p>

The venue is not for profit, with every dollar made being used to pay bills, make general improvements and, most importantly, pay local and touring artists. The We Are The New Direction campaign aims to make improvements that are out of reach with the monthly income alone. It also aims to give the community a sense of ownership in the space, that it is a space for everyone to enjoy no matter what walk of life you come from. Central to the Campaign is a fundraising drive through IndieGoGo.  We aim to raise at least $2,000 through the site to improve the sound system, concert area, and general look of the space. Some of the highlights include new speakers, a new logo, and a redesigned stage. As an incentive/ reward for donating, contributors will get their name on a wall of support at the venue. If they pledge enough they will also receive a tee shirt commemorating their contribution. The drive will run from June 20th to July 31st.

<p>The
Scarlet Fever have become a staple in the Toronto alt-rock scene, combining
their flair for energetic and dramatic stage shows with a sound that blends the
darker and more surreal side of psychedelia with their post punk and glam rock
roots. Their accomplishments include a nomination for best independent album at
the Toronto Independent Music Awards, and holding their own in an opening slot
for cult heroes The Sex Gang Children.</p>
<p>We, as a
band, have always tried to remain a self sustaining entity, but the magnitude
of finishing our sophomore album has proven to be more than we can handle by
ourselves at this time. With hopes of providing our fans with the best product
possible, we are reaching out to you, to join us in making this our best work
to date.  With seven tracks all but
completed, and three to four more ready to record, we are close enough to taste
the finish line.

</p><p>We truly
love our fans and supporters and we not only want to bring them the best sonic
experience, as only The Scarlet Fever can, but have also constructed a campaign
to excite the music fan in all of us.</p><p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We're
pretty close to a finished product as is, but we still have 3 to 4 more tracks
to lay down before we reach a solid LP length album. Plus, there are the costs
of final mixing and mastering, and then the costs of manufacturing the CD's
themselves. Why stop at just CDs though?! If we reach our final goal it would
be our dream to give this collection of songs the proper release the music
deserves with both CD <i>and</i> vinyl formats. Just imagine
laying down a slab of scarlet red vinyl on your turntable and cranking the
volume way up! Sexy? We think so! </p>
<p>To give
you a more clear idea of where the money is going, here is a quick run down:</p><p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To finish recording the album:</span><br/>

<p><b>What You Get!</b></p>
<p>What?!
You want more than the satisfaction of helping someone out?? Well, you got it!
We have a very exciting list of perks ranging from our retro cool styled gig
posters, the album itself, and an hour with our very own super talented massage
therapist. You could even see your name next to producer’s credits of your very
own Scarlet Fever album!</p>
<p><b>The Impact </b></p>
<p>In an age where there is little value left for hard working bands, live music, and the sweat and blood that goes into the art of a well crafted album, you have a chance to help rekindle the fire of a dying art form by a band that truly loves the medium. We want to bring you an album that you will listen to from front to back, many times over, for many years. An experience that you can take as you please, when you feel the urge for that one specific song, or immerse yourself in with your headphones on and the rest of the world tuned out. This suspended reality will exist in your speakers because of your generosity and passion for the art of rock n roll.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span> </p>

What You Get!
What?!
You want more than the satisfaction of helping someone out?? Well, you got it!
We have a very exciting list of perks ranging from our retro cool styled gig
posters, the album itself, and an hour with our very own super talented massage
therapist. You could even see your name next to producer’s credits of your very
own Scarlet Fever album!
The Impact 
In an age where there is little value left for hard working bands, live music, and the sweat and blood that goes into the art of a well crafted album, you have a chance to help rekindle the fire of a dying art form by a band that truly loves the medium. We want to bring you an album that you will listen to from front to back, many times over, for many years. An experience that you can take as you please, when you feel the urge for that one specific song, or immerse yourself in with your headphones on and the rest of the world tuned out. This suspended reality will exist in your speakers because of your generosity and passion for the art of rock n roll.

<p><b><i>About Me &amp; The Album:</i></b></p>
<p>My name is Donald Hunt.  I'm a
singer-songwriter (and recent Berklee College of Music graduate) preparing to
record my debut album entitled “Life Or Imagination”. The album is to be
recorded in January 2014.</p>
<p>The album will contain 13 songs consisting
of nine original songs and four jazz standards of which include “Shiny
Stockings”, “I’ll Get By”,  “Love Dance” and “Lush Life. The album’s
musical styles are very diverse with swing, Latin swing, Argentine tango,
bolero, bossanova, straight 8ths, gypsy jazz and ballads all being
representative. </p>
<p>Nik Rodewald and I serve as the album’s
producers with Nik also engineering each track. This special project will
feature the Grammy award-winning Turtle Island Quartet as well as some of
Nashville’s most seasoned musicians. Cedric Hanriot will write the string
arrangements for the Turtle Island Quartet. </p>
<p>Above, you will find two live
performances of ""Will You?"" and ""Savor the Now, Forget the
Rest"". These two tracks will appear on the album and are written by Nik
Rodewald and myself! You can also visit my official website at <a href=""http://www.donaldhuntmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.donaldhuntmusic.com</span></a>

It was most recently featured on the ""Garbage Feet"" segment of MTV's ""Ridiculousness"" starring Derek Hough from ABC's Dancing with the Star's.Since her success with “Catch Me I'm Falling”, Jade has charted 7 times on Billboard.BREAKING BAD SEASON 4Kickin It Old Skool Don't Mess With The ZohanTHE CAMPAIGN""CAPTIVE"" is my debut solo album and I'm very proud of it!! ""Insomniak"", the first single from ""CAPTIVE"" broke into Billboard's Top 30 Club Singles Chart earlier this year. ""Insomniak"" was the result of a successful KICKSTARTER campaign that I launched in July of 2013 when I successfully raised just over $21,000. This allowed me to pay for 3 remixes at an average of $2500 ea, radio promotion, club promotion (both in the US and in Europe) and make & promote a video.  For ""CAPTIVE"" I'm going to need a minimum of $15,000 to pay for advertising, social media promotion, and club & radio promotion for the 2nd single ""THINKIN ABOUT U"". Any additional money that is raised during this INDIEGOGO campaign will go towards the creation of additional videos, aggressive radio promotion and to launch a fully routed ground based tour. The success of  ""INSOMNIAK"" was just the beginning. ""CAPTIVE"" has the potential to be my most successful release since “Catch Me I’m Falling” ruled the charts. ""CAPTIVE"" features several collaborations between me, my long time writing partner Whey Cooler and popular British DJ/remixer Lee Dagger of “BIMBO JONES” fame as well as the fast rising star Laszlo and French Universal recording artist Franck Dona.LEE DAGGER of BIMBO JONES“I met Lee while SKYPING with Bimbo Jones last June to discuss their remixing my song “Dance Revolution” which appears on ""CAPTIVE"". After they delivered an amazing remix, I asked Lee if he had any tracks that we could collaborate on. He emailed me 20 or so tracks and I along with Whey picked a few and started writing. The results were so good that we kept writing and writing until we had a dozen new songs. “INSOMNIAK”, ""ONLY LOVE"",""SPONTANEOUS"",THINKIN ABOUT U"",""SUBLIMINAL"",""EVERY LIL BEAT"",""A PLACE IN THE SUN"" and ""AWAKE"" are all featured on the ""CAPTIVE"" LP and among the best songs I've ever written. These are songs for and of the SKYPE era where writing and recording could occur between people a world away simultaneously.I finally got to meet up with Lee for real in Miami when we presented an award together at the Winter Music Conference’s International Dance Music Awards (IDMAs) last year. I had a similar experience with hot new comer LASZLO who is based in Denver with songs like ""Love of a Lifetime"", ""Better and Better"", ""Runaway Hearts"" and ""Step by Step"" all of which are featured on ""CAPTIVE"".With Franck Dona, I was introduced to him through long time friend Chris Schwartz who gave the world Lauryn Hill and the Fugees, with his Ruff House Records.Franck Dona was making noise in France and on Chris' radar. Franck had some tracks and was looking to collaborate with other writers. He sent me a few tracks and one just really spoke to me, the result is ""Everything in the World"".I played “THINKIN ABOUT U” around for some tough audiences and everyone was reacting to this record! Lee had similar reactions in Prague, Switzerland and Australia where he played it in his sets!!! Of course just having a great song is a small piece of the puzzle especially when dealing with the EDM community. (Electronic Dance Music) In order to chart a record on the Billboard Club Chart, you need at least 3-6 different mixes all of which cost money, then you have to buy a club promotion because you need someone to organize the DJs to report the record to Billboard at the same time not to mention the Dance Radio promotion!!(which cost twice as much as the club promotion) I’ve used promotion companies (Loren Chaidez Promotions & Promo Only) who are among the best in the business. (With that said, they charge accordingly lol) The project will be managed by my long time associate Vince Corea who will oversee the promotion staff, video production and remixes.So to recap, I’m trying to raise the $15,000 necessary to pay for the remixes, and promotion campaign.I have been performing around the US at clubs and as part of the FREESTYLE EXPLOSION concert series along with Lisa Lisa, Stevie B, Expose, Cover Girls, Stacy Q, Debbie Deb, Shannon, Johnny O, Nu Shooz, Cynthia and Nocera.These shows are a lot of fun and hugely successful with 5,000 – 10,000 fans showing up at each show.

<p>Today, Crosspulse opens the sixth annual International Body Music Festival (IBMF).  Running November 5-10, this will be a truly international event featuring 75 artists from 9 countries. I began producing the Festival in 2008 after receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship, and we have alternated locations between the Bay Area and abroad (São Paulo in 2010 and Istanbul in 2012). This year’s Festival is the most ambitious to date. Based in Oakland, San Francisco and Berkeley we’ll offer concerts, classes, workshops, and in-school events, reaching an incredibly diverse audience.</p>
<p>We’re enormously proud of the success and recognition that the Festival has achieved both nationally and internationally. It has become the focal point for both the artists and audiences involved in the world’s oldest musical form. I’m sure that you understand that producing a festival of this scope and magnitude requires the hard work of a dedicated staff and scores of volunteers. It also requires the generosity of our friends in the community such as you. That’s why we would like to ask you to join with us to make the year’s Festival the most memorable one yet. </p>
<p>We do face some special hurdles this time around. The government shutdown made the always onerous task of obtaining visas for our visiting artists almost impossible. We hired a lawyer skilled in the area of visas for international artists in order to complete this process in time. However the extra costs involved here – which includes having to book last minute, expensive airfares – has put a strain on our already frugal budget. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago we launched an indiegogo fundraising campaign to meet a matching grant awarded to Crosspulse from the East Bay Community Foundation to support the IBMF's opening spectacle that takes place tonight in downtown Oakland - a free, outdoor event featuring IBMF artists and vertical dance company, Bandaloop.  We recently met that goal and are now seeking to raise additional funds to help offset these unforeseen visa and travel costs created as a result of the government shutdown.</p>
<p>With the help of our friends we are confident that the Festival will be a spectacular and unique artistic event here in the Bay Area. Would you please join our team by making a contribution today?</p>
<p>We deeply appreciate your consideration.</p>

<p><br/></p>--------------------------------<p><br/></p>
<p>My name is Keith Terry and I’m the Artistic Director of Crosspulse, a non-profit arts organization based in Oakland, California.  On November 5, 2013, a swarm of international Body Musicians—snapping, clapping, stepping, singing — will descend on the San Francisco Bay Area for the 6th International Body Music Festival (IBMF).  It’s the biggest and most ambitious festival we’ve ever produced and the Opening Event is unlike anything we've ever done.  </p>
<p>Crosspulse has been awarded an $8,000 matching grant from the East Bay Community Foundation for aerial dancers Bandaloop to perform on the side of a building in Downtown Oakland, with a Body Music Orchestra below them, providing the score.  The orchestra will be comprised of groups Corposonic (Oakland, CA), Barbatuques (São Paulo, Brazil), Çudamani (Bali, Indonesia), many other Festival Artists, and YOU, the audience!</p>
<p>This amazing and unusual collaboration encapsulates everything the IBMF is about —connecting people and communities, artist and audience. It is art that is accessible, present, and dynamic.  It infuses our home community of Oakland with this international spark of talent and energy, and shows off our resurgent city at its best. This Opening Event of the Festival is brand new, extremely exciting, and FREE.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p>We need $8000 to match this grant.  But honestly, we could use much, much more to produce the full 6 days of the Festival to its best capacity. We have fantastic perks in exchange for your contribution, plus we welcome you into the incredible experience of being a part of an unusual, 3-dimensional live performance, in the heart of a diverse urban scene.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Body Music is a very human artform, the oldest music on the planet.  Music you can SEE, dance you can HEAR, Body Music connects people on a visceral level.  Where we fear foreign influence and ideas, when we tighten our borders, Body Music is a common language - we all share basically the same instrument. </p>
<p>The IBMF is a gathering of talents and traditions, curated into an open and welcoming festival environment. We are bringing a host of artists from Brazil, Indonesia, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Canada and across the US to present and collaborate within our community—with local artists, with our audiences and with many different communities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.  </p>
<p>In 2011, many of you helped us successfully raise over $13,000 for the 4th IBMF.  That kept us in the black so that we could take the Festival to Istanbul, Turkey in 2012.  For the next few years the IBMF will be produced overseas.  Please help us produce this incredible event now, in our hometown.  If we don’t meet our goal we will not receive the matching grant, but whatever funds we raise will still be used to create this vibrant project.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>We <b>need</b> your contribution to meet our matching grant.  If we exceed our goal, even better, we can put it to good use.  And if you can’t donate, you can still help us by sharing this page with your friends and families.  Thank you for your support.</p>

<h3>About Us and the EP</h3>
<p>We of Flashpoint are a young trio of folk musicians from Dallas playing tunes rooted in the Irish and surrounding traditions.   We are comprised of brothers David and Daniel Mehalko and Joseph Carmichael.</p>
<p>After meeting at the O'Flaherty Irish Music Youth Camp back in the summer of 2009 we got our start playing at a local Farmer's Market in McKinney, slowly developing our playing styles and repertoire, and eventually establishing ourselves as a fully-fledged band.</p>
<p>As a band and individually we have performed at venues and festivals throughout the US, such as the North Texas Irish Festival, Austin Celtic Fest, Kansas City Irish Festival, and have recently had the great privilege of opening for bands such as Solas and FullSet.</p>
<p>In the winter of 2011-2012 we recorded our debut album, ""Jammed"", comprised of traditional and contemporary tunes.</p>
<p>Since then we've honed our ideas and want to get back into the studio to bring them to you all in the form of a 5-track EP.</p>
<p>Stylistically we expect this recording to be much different than the first, including more modern arrangements, vocals, and a select few guest musicians.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We've already got about $1,000 set aside from sales of our previous CD, but we hope to raise another $3,000 with your help.</p>
<p>The $3,000 will go towards the studio costs of recording, mixing and mastering.

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>Who are we? Well without getting too intimate, we are Carly Thomas and Lori Girard, two singer songwriters with a desire to share our songs and live the dream. Doing what you're passionate about isn't easy - but it's without a doubt worth it; unfortunately, it rarely comes free. We all want to do what makes us happy and we all want to share that happiness with others and nothing would make us happier than living in a van and singing across Canada for 17 days! Really! Hopping on a train-car undetected with our guitars, CDs and merch is not really feasible so to make our very first -<strong>yes very first!-</strong> tour a success, we need your help. We are hoping to get by with a little help from our friends. The cost of gas is our biggest concern and you can help us turn dreams into gasoline so we can exhale with relief and focus on making every show the very best it can be! </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p>We need some extra cash to fund our gas bills, so that we don't have to rip our hair out while driving across the country! </p>
</div>
<p>What YOU get is some great perks that don't smell like gas at all. Like, want Lori's BRAND NEW CD? Easy! She'll send you a signed copy. Want To hear Carly or Lori cover a song just for you on Youtube?? Your request becomes our command and your kindness comes back to you. Want some sweet merch? Buy it here so we can put it in our tanks! Want to give us a tip? Any amount you give is going directly into fueling our dreams! We so appreciate the support from our friends, family and fans. What you give you always get back. So check out the donation options and get yourself some sweet and often limited edition stuff!! And as always, high fives and hugs are always free at our shows!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>The Impact</strong></span></p>
<p>If we can share our music across the country without racking up a huge debt, it will be that much more possible to do it again! You would be helping to make our musical dreams come true! (So cheesy but true).</p>

Who are we? Well without getting too intimate, we are Carly Thomas and Lori Girard, two singer songwriters with a desire to share our songs and live the dream. Doing what you're passionate about isn't easy - but it's without a doubt worth it; unfortunately, it rarely comes free. We all want to do what makes us happy and we all want to share that happiness with others and nothing would make us happier than living in a van and singing across Canada for 17 days! Really! Hopping on a train-car undetected with our guitars, CDs and merch is not really feasible so to make our very first -yes very first!- tour a success, we need your help. We are hoping to get by with a little help from our friends. The cost of gas is our biggest concern and you can help us turn dreams into gasoline so we can exhale with relief and focus on making every show the very best it can be! 
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need some extra cash to fund our gas bills, so that we don't have to rip our hair out while driving across the country! 

What YOU get is some great perks that don't smell like gas at all. Like, want Lori's BRAND NEW CD? Easy! She'll send you a signed copy. Want To hear Carly or Lori cover a song just for you on Youtube?? Your request becomes our command and your kindness comes back to you. Want some sweet merch? Buy it here so we can put it in our tanks! Want to give us a tip? Any amount you give is going directly into fueling our dreams! We so appreciate the support from our friends, family and fans. What you give you always get back. So check out the donation options and get yourself some sweet and often limited edition stuff!! And as always, high fives and hugs are always free at our shows!
The Impact
If we can share our music across the country without racking up a huge debt, it will be that much more possible to do it again! You would be helping to make our musical dreams come true! (So cheesy but true).

 
Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute financially, you can still help. Be part of a street team that puts posters up where we are playing! Host a house concert in your town or city! Call up your crazy uncle who happens to work for a radio station and get us some exposure! Come to a show or tell your friends and family about our shows.  Give us a place to stay on the tour or recommend a venue for a date that we have open!!!

</div>
<br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h3>
<strong>Who are we?</strong> </h3>
<p>We are three highly-regarded musical organizations in one: the all-professional<strong> New York Virtuoso Singers (NYVS)</strong>, the volunteer and community-based <strong>Canticum Novum Singers (CNS)</strong>, and <b>The</b> <strong>Canticum Novum Youth Choir</strong>,
 all under the direction of founder and conductor, Harold Rosenbaum. 
 Collectively, the groups are under the 501(c)3 umbrella of Canticorum 
Virtuosi, Inc.</p>
<p>We are almost halfway to our $40,000 goal -- and this is where you can help us.</p>
<h3><strong>Why should you contribute to this campaign? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>We’ll give you seven good reasons:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>When you give to our 2013 Matching Fund Challenge, you support all three vocal ensembles. </strong>
 Each group performs for a different and distinct part of the New York 
metropolitan area concert audience, so all three combine to make for a 
large and extremely diverse public that your support helps us reach. </li>
<li>
<strong>It’s good to know you’re giving to one of the best and most visible organizations in American choral music.</strong> 
 For The New York Virtuoso Singers alone, Harold Rosenbaum has 
commissioned over 50 new choral works from internationally-recognized 
composers, many of whom have received such high honors as the Pulitzer 
Prize.  Both NYVS and Canticum Novum have created an extensive catalog 
of choral recordings, and have toured in the US and Europe.</li>
<li>
<strong>We work with great musicians</strong> – our 
Founder/Conductor, Harold Rosenbaum, is universally recognized as one of
 the finest choral conductors of our time. The singers of NYVS are the 
finest the New York area has to offer. The all-volunteer Canticum Novum 
is widely acclaimed for its very high quality, and has done 4 
international tours. We also present world-class soloists who join our 
groups in spectacular performances of timeless classics and new works by
 many of the world’s great composers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music, the arts, and music education are good for business</strong>
 – Communities with strong music and arts organizations and education 
programs are communities that attract and sustain business. The Canticum
 Novum Youth Choir is a strong example of music education and the 
difference it can make: our Youth Choir members have the opportunity to 
sing music at a much higher level to which they would be exposed in 
their schools.</li>
<li>
<strong>We need more than we earn</strong> – Sustaining and growing a
 high-level arts organization like ours costs a bit of money, and 
concert ticket sales alone cannot cover our entire budget.</li>
<li>
<strong>We have a vision</strong> – our groups have a bright future 
and big plans, and with your help will continue to bring music to people
 in New York City and beyond for many years to come:<ul>
<li>NYVS will commission ten recent young award-winning composers who 
have not yet written choral works.  Harold Rosenbaum will mentor them 
during the creative process and NYVS will perform them.</li>
<li> CNS will present masterworks with professional orchestra and soloists.</li>
<li>NYVS will perform World Premieres of recent works and U.S. Premieres of those from past centuries.</li>
<li>The youth choir will perform with CNS in Bach’s St. Matthew Passion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Nobody will tax your generosity</strong> – all donations to Canticorum Virtuosi, Inc. are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law.</li>

<p>We are DEAD SEASON, an independent metal/rock band from Maine formed in 2003.<span>  Over the past decade we’ve made a name for ourselves writing songs with meaningful lyrics, top notch musicianship, and playing hundreds of intense live shows for our fans. We've sold 25,000+ cd's and proud to have done it all on our own, completely self-funded. <br/><br/>We decided to launch this campaign because we need your help.  Commercial radio is only playing and supporting national major label artists, people are buying less cd's than ever before, and attendance at shows is down due to the struggling economy.  Over the years we've been able to pay-off recording debts through cd sales and income from live shows but due to the issues mentioned previously we are struggling to afford the costs of recording new music.  Many continue to ask us ""when are you guys going to come out with some new music?""…well, this is your chance to make it happen!</span></p>

There are also other cool perks for those able to contribute more than $10 such as t-shirts, live DEAD SEASON show at your house, and much more!  We are hoping to raise $10,000 which we’ll use to record new songs.  If we are unable to reach the entire goal we'll still be able to receive whatever funds have been raised.  Obviously the more funding we get, the more music we'll be able to put out.  Who knows, maybe we can surpass this goal if we get an overwhelming amount of support.  Depending on how much money is raised, we may be able to put together a small recording studio allowing us to record an unlimited amount of new music in the future!</span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey y'all! For anyone new here, my name is Seph Schlueter, and I am an young Christian artist from Ohio. In the summer of 2019, I felt called to start recording and releasing songs I wrote, and I released my first one that fall. The Lord said to keep going, so shortly afterwards, I crowdfunded my next song and released it. That was nearly a year ago. Here's a little snapshot of the things that have happened since:</p>
<p>-I led a new Catholic Worship movement, Damascus Worship movement, to put out our first full album</p>
<p>- We released our first live song/music video shortly after, called ""I Believe."" </p>
<p>-I got to go to Texas to write with some awesome people, and am going back to record a song I wrote with them</p>
<p>-I spent a week in Nashville writing and making demos with some super talented writers/producers there</p>
<p>-I had the opportunity to open for Phil Wickham in a 3 day concert in Florida,</p>
<p>-And so much more!</p>
<p>It's been a crazy yet beautiful year in many ways, and I am so excited to begin to show you some of the fruit of what I've been up to in the last year. But, I need your help.</p>
<p><b>Making a song is expensive</b>, and it's something that I can't do on my own. So, I'm here looking for people interested in helping make this a reality. And to have some fun along the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $1,500 for this project. This will cover every step of the song; recording, producing, mixing, mastering, and the marketing of it. I've made a lot of really cool connections in the past months which will allow for this song to really sound better than ever before, but also quality is pricier. </p>
<p>However, like I said, I want to have some fun with this. And what's more fun than some special perks to go along with supporting a meaningful project, right? (Definitely a few things, but we'll just leave it there for now.) Here are some of the perks for supporting:</p>
<p>$10: Get the song a week early (the ""I Liked It Before It Was Cool"" perk)</p>
<p>$25: ^ + Exclusive Acoustic Video of Song (The ""For All You Visual People Out There"" perk)</p>
<p>$50: ^^ + Video Explaining/Teaching Songwriting Process (The ""I Like The Behind The Scenes"" perk)</p>
<p>$100: ^^^ + Free Merch! (Long-Sleeve Shirt) (The ""Boutta Look FLY"" perk)</p>
<p>$250: ^^^^ + Demos of 3 Future Songs (The ""Ahead Of The Times"" perk)</p>
<p>$500: ^^^^^ + In-House/On Campus Worship Night (The ""My House Is A Temple"" perk)</p>
<p>So. That's pretty fun, right? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am still so continuously blown away by all the messages I still </span>regularly<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> get about my last song, and how it has changed/still impacts their lives. When I set out to do that song, I had no idea the scope or influence the Lord was about to give it, and I am still in wonder at it all.</span></p>
<p>So I guess this is the same. To have the chance to write a song that has the opportunity to reach and touch hundreds of thousands of hearts is mind-blowing. But that's the reality of where we're at. That this song can reach hundreds of thousands with the message that despite our circumstances, God is still in control (song title hint? ? ) So your support will directly contribute to that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you aren't able to contribute financially. But there are other ways you can help:</p>
<p>-Keep this project, this song, and me in your prayers; that God will guide everything from start to finish, and that all will be for His glory.</p>
<p>-Tell other people about it! Maybe you have friends or family who can help. Give them a chance to use their finances to help make a difference.</p>
<p>-Go social! Share it on social media; Instagram, Tik Tok, Facebook, Twitter, etc. (Reddit anyone?). Let's spread the word!</p>

<h3>Self-Taught Girl Drummer</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518459717/oitekputyf1fwnljv0up.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>I am a self-taught girl drummer. I live in a village not far from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. I started drumming when I was 6. I create drum covers of rock and pop songs and put them on my YouTube channel <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/KateKuziakina"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube.com/KateKuziakina</a></p>
<p>Drums mean to me much more than dolls and games - music is my passion and my toy. I fall asleep with my pink drumsticks more often than with a teddy bear.</p>
<p>In comments to my videos people say that I am very talented and have a bright future. But I know exactly that my drum covers are not perfect yet and there is no future without solid music foundation.</p>
<p>So my biggest dream is to get good music education to create music and videos that people love and that encourage children to learn drumming.</p>
<h3>What I Hope to Raise</h3>
<p>I hope to take about 10 lessons per month for 10 months. On the average it is 300-350 USD per month - this includes tuition fees, educational materials (textbooks, etc), and drum gear maintenance. So totally with overheads I need 3500 USD.</p>
<h3>Why I Need Your Support</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>There is no music school nearby</strong> in the radius of ~70 km, especially with the course Drums. Therefore, we have to find a tutor.</li>
<li>
<strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518461094/nqjkpqg8pl9bd89rvgtn.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>High tutoring rates</strong>: Good tutors (nearest to us) are in the country capital. Their rates are high. Also, add to this the transportation costs to reach the village where we live now.</li>
<li>
<strong>Overheads</strong>: Drumheads wear out, plates crack, drumsticks break. To tune drums, we need special tools. Also, we need microphones and equipment for recording videos.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drums and tools are expensive</strong>, especially in comparison with local salaries.</li>
<li>
<strong>My parents</strong> and my older sister help me very, very much. But it is not so easy to raise three children (I have also a younger syster). </li>
<li>
<strong>Sometimes friends help us</strong> - give me lessons and drum gifts. But that cannot replace the tutor.</li>
<li>
<strong>We minimize our expenses</strong> - for example, we shoot and edit videos ourselves.</li>
<li>
<strong>I try to gain some money</strong> too. But</li>
<li>
<strong>Videos does NOT give earnings</strong>: I make drum covers of rock songs. According to the copyright laws, even if ads are shown, all money goes to the copyright owners. I get NOTHING.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we need additional money. These funds are strictly intended for tuition and drums maintenance.</p>
<h3>If We Don't Reach Entire Goal</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518459485/etwd756jvzdfy0ghio0r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>If we don't reach our entire goal, then the funds will go for paying tuition fees for as many drum lessons as possible. If there's some money left over that cannot be used for tuition (for example, it is less than necessary for 1 lesson), then we will use it for buying drum gear.</p>
<h3>Am I a Talent?</h3>
<p>You may say: ""<i>Hey, girl! Why are you sure that you are a talent? Your Mom that said?</i>"" No. I've tried to check it out and won such awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalist of the International Contest of female drummers ""Hit Like A Girl"", USA, 2016</li>
<li>Grand Prix at the International Art Festival ""ArtistA"", Benalmádena, Spain, October 2016</li>
<li>Grand Prix at the Festival of Creative Collectives ""Antelope Gold"", Kyiv, Ukraine, 2016</li>
<li>First place at the International Festival ""Christmas star"", Vuokatti, Finland, 2017</li>
<li>Grand Prix at the International Children's Festival ""Golden Dream"", Las Vegas, USA, 2017</li>
<li>The First Prize at the competition ""Wonder Kid"" in the nomination ""Most Creative Child"", Kyiv, Ukraine, 2017</li>

</div></div>","Self-Taught Girl Drummer
I am a self-taught girl drummer. I live in a village not far from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. I started drumming when I was 6. I create drum covers of rock and pop songs and put them on my YouTube channel Youtube.com/KateKuziakina
Drums mean to me much more than dolls and games - music is my passion and my toy. I fall asleep with my pink drumsticks more often than with a teddy bear.
In comments to my videos people say that I am very talented and have a bright future. But I know exactly that my drum covers are not perfect yet and there is no future without solid music foundation.
So my biggest dream is to get good music education to create music and videos that people love and that encourage children to learn drumming.
What I Hope to Raise
I hope to take about 10 lessons per month for 10 months. On the average it is 300-350 USD per month - this includes tuition fees, educational materials (textbooks, etc), and drum gear maintenance. So totally with overheads I need 3500 USD.
Why I Need Your Support


There is no music school nearby in the radius of ~70 km, especially with the course Drums. Therefore, we have to find a tutor.

High tutoring rates: Good tutors (nearest to us) are in the country capital. Their rates are high. Also, add to this the transportation costs to reach the village where we live now.

Overheads: Drumheads wear out, plates crack, drumsticks break. To tune drums, we need special tools. Also, we need microphones and equipment for recording videos.

Drums and tools are expensive, especially in comparison with local salaries.

My parents and my older sister help me very, very much. But it is not so easy to raise three children (I have also a younger syster). 

Sometimes friends help us - give me lessons and drum gifts. But that cannot replace the tutor.

We minimize our expenses - for example, we shoot and edit videos ourselves.

I try to gain some money too. But

Videos does NOT give earnings: I make drum covers of rock songs. According to the copyright laws, even if ads are shown, all money goes to the copyright owners. I get NOTHING.

That is why we need additional money. These funds are strictly intended for tuition and drums maintenance.
If We Don't Reach Entire Goal
If we don't reach our entire goal, then the funds will go for paying tuition fees for as many drum lessons as possible. If there's some money left over that cannot be used for tuition (for example, it is less than necessary for 1 lesson), then we will use it for buying drum gear.
Am I a Talent?
You may say: ""Hey, girl! Why are you sure that you are a talent? Your Mom that said?"" No. I've tried to check it out and won such awards:

Finalist of the International Contest of female drummers ""Hit Like A Girl"", USA, 2016
Grand Prix at the International Art Festival ""ArtistA"", Benalmádena, Spain, October 2016
Grand Prix at the Festival of Creative Collectives ""Antelope Gold"", Kyiv, Ukraine, 2016
First place at the International Festival ""Christmas star"", Vuokatti, Finland, 2017
Grand Prix at the International Children's Festival ""Golden Dream"", Las Vegas, USA, 2017
The First Prize at the competition ""Wonder Kid"" in the nomination ""Most Creative Child"", Kyiv, Ukraine, 2017

Is It My First Campaing?
This is not our first campaign - the money for the trip to the USA mentioned above we mainly raised here on Indiegogo.

Future of Talent in Your Hands
Helping me, you support a talent. Helping me, you make my dreams come true. Supporting me, you help to eliminate the injustice when people have no equal rights to get education. I do believe that these all make our world a bit better.

Possible Risks
Yes, there is a risk. Its name is procrastination. But thank God I have an older sister and my Dad and Mom. My sister Valerie is my manager. She selects songs to play, films clips, edits videos, and manages social networks. She encourages me and supports me. Due Valerie we have overcome a lot of obstacles. My Dad helps me a lot too.

We made our goal and we couldn't have done it without each and every one of you. Now we have a new one.

Everyone who donates any amount from August 12th to the end of the campaign on Monday, August 15th will receive a special handmade mystery gift and an unreleased Spark and Echo demo track in addition to the normal perks!

So donate now and help us make this an album to remember.  


Cup O' Joy Concert:

We had a fantastic show this past weekend at the Cup O' Joy in Green Bay. We were able to perform all the new things we have been working on, including almost all of the songs from our upcoming album! Thank you to all those who came out and showed their support both with their presence and their donations. Want to hear a song from the album? Click here to listen to a demo of More Than Rubies, a beautiful song by Jonathon. The album version includes Emily on her as-yet-unnamed clarinet! 



This Just In:
We are thrilled to announce that renowned musician and producer Jay Foote will be producing this album! You may know him from Welcome Wagon, from one of his many appearances playing bass on every late night talk show, or you may know him from one of his many other gigs.
Learn all about him at www.JayFoote.com.

Our Story
After two years of playing his piano/vocal songs solo in NYC clubs, Jonathon Roberts wanted to play with other musicians.  Meanwhile, his lovely wife (me) was looking for ways to play more music. As we started singing together, our voices magically blended and the spark was lit. When Boris the Bassoon entered the picture, followed by Christopher Robin the Baritone Ukulele and friends, we had a band!
We also have a non-profit for which to play. As ambassadors of good cheer we have performed valiantly through New York City and the wild woods of Wisconsin, spreading our music and telling audiences about Spark and Echo Arts. 
Spark and Echo Arts (501(c)3) was founded over a year ago in New York City by Jonathon and I, and is now a community of talented artists and volunteers.  The goal of Spark and Echo Arts is to create a giant multi-disciplinary ""illuminated"" Bible with a piece of art, music, dance, theater or poetry covering every passage of the Bible.  We create, inspire, support and showcase new art from emerging artists in NYC and beyond.

The Project
A full length album produced in New York City, featuring Spark and Echo the Band. The album will consist of original songs responding to biblical text, written by Jonathon Roberts. The core of the band is Jonathon Roberts on vocals and piano, and me (Emily Clare Zempel) on vocals, bassoon, baritone ukulele, Melodica and clarinet. For the album we will be joined by some of the fabulous musicians we have connected with through the Spark and Echo Arts community.  The album will be rehearsed this summer, followed by recording sessions and a release in the Fall.   
The Impact

At www.SparkAndEcho.org you can already listen to many of Jonathon’s songs that have been recorded as demos. By making a professionally produced album we will raise the quality of music on our website and spread awareness about the great work by some amazing artists that is coming out of Spark and Echo Arts.  

Spark and Echo Arts was started by a generous founding grant and individual donations from supporters like you.  We've done well our first year featuring work covering over 500 passages in the Bible and holding many live events. To continue sustaining this pace we need to develop new income streams. This album will be a fun, inspiring way to keep the non-profit running effectively. Once the album is released all income from CD sales will go directly to Spark and Echo Arts, helping us continue supporting the artistic community around us. 
What We Need 
Our budget is $6,500, of which we have already raised $4,000 through individual donations. We’re hoping you can help us raise the last $2,500 to make this an album of competitive quality and to get it out to the public. 

The costs involved include paying our producer, booking studio time, hiring an engineer, hiring additional musicians, mixing, mastering, duplicating, and marketing. 


If we don’t reach our fundraising goal, we will still make an album, but it will be less likely that the album will help make our non-profit sustainable, and we will not have the money to reach our audience. 


We worked hard crafting some great perks for your donations. Be sure to check them out! Remember, even a donation of $5 can make a difference. 

And since we're a non-profit, all donations made through PayPal are deductible! (You don't need a PayPal account). 
Other Ways You Can Help
The best way you can help, apart from your generous donations, is to spread the word about this campaign and Spark and Echo Arts! 

Please share the campaign via the social media links above, and check out our website www.SparkAndEcho.org

Thanks for all your help, we couldn't do it without you!

<p>My name is Hillary Esqueda. I am writing on behalf of a small, but powerful opera company in NYC called OperaOggiNY. I have worked as a singer for OperaOggiNY for over a year, and I have now been given the chance to direct their winter performance, Englebert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p>OperaOggiNY is a rare and magical company run by singers. Our goal is to bring opera to the people in their own communities by creating portable productions that we tour within the tri-state area. We foster the talent of many young singers and accompanists through our productions, and urge our singers to use their many different talents towards putting together a full production in whatever locale we inhabit.</p>
<p>Though we have tried our best to gain a following, our company is still struggling to put together productions with little to no budget. Our gala fundraiser was scheduled for November 4th in Soho, and had to be canceled due to the flooding following Hurricane Sandy, leaving us with no way of collecting funds for Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p>We are not asking for a lot. We are just asking that you donate what you can to help us get the bare necessities for this show. Anything collected beyond the costs of this production will be donated directly to OperaOggiNY to fund our future productions. We understand that in these times, donating is not easy, but just as we have always worked as a team, I urge you to, as well. If everyone who sees this donates 5 or 10 dollars, we will reach our goal in no time. </p>
<p>However, if you DO chose to give more, we can offer you a few perks as our way of saying Thank You!</p>
<p>-For a donation of $75 you can claim 1 ticket to a performance of Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p>-For a donation of $150 you can claim 2 tickets to a performance of Hansel and Gretel.</p>
<p>-And if you are very generous and make a donation of $500, you can schedule a 45 minute concert with our singers in your own home!</p>
<p>These Perks are only available to those in the Tristate area (approximately a 60 mile radius around NYC), or those visiting the NYC area for the performance. In the case of the concert, you must arrange your concert by January 31, 2013. For tickets, please donate at least 48 hours before the date you wish to attend.</p>
<p>(If you would just like to buy advanced tickets, please visit operaogginy.info for more information on dates and times!)</p>

Our gala fundraiser was scheduled for November 4th in Soho, and had to be canceled due to the flooding following Hurricane Sandy, leaving us with no way of collecting funds for Hansel and Gretel.
We are not asking for a lot. We are just asking that you donate what you can to help us get the bare necessities for this show. Anything collected beyond the costs of this production will be donated directly to OperaOggiNY to fund our future productions. We understand that in these times, donating is not easy, but just as we have always worked as a team, I urge you to, as well. If everyone who sees this donates 5 or 10 dollars, we will reach our goal in no time. 
However, if you DO chose to give more, we can offer you a few perks as our way of saying Thank You!
-For a donation of $75 you can claim 1 ticket to a performance of Hansel and Gretel.
-For a donation of $150 you can claim 2 tickets to a performance of Hansel and Gretel.
-And if you are very generous and make a donation of $500, you can schedule a 45 minute concert with our singers in your own home!
These Perks are only available to those in the Tristate area (approximately a 60 mile radius around NYC), or those visiting the NYC area for the performance. In the case of the concert, you must arrange your concert by January 31, 2013. For tickets, please donate at least 48 hours before the date you wish to attend.
(If you would just like to buy advanced tickets, please visit operaogginy.info for more information on dates and times!)
We thank you for your support!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hospital Heroes is an exciting new charitable endeavor in which I, Dustin Dorough, will be hitting the road to visit at least one children's hospital in every one of the 48 continental United States and at least three Canadian provinces while wearing my movie quality Superman uniforms.</p>
<p>During these visits, the children will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>An autographed 8x10 picture of Superman (Thanks to Superhero Photography by Adam Jay <a href=""http://www.superherophotography.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.superherophotography.co.uk</a> )</li>
<li>A ""Certificate of Heroism"" in recognition for the bravery exhibited in their personal struggles and all those that they have been able to inspire with their strength in fighting their illnesses.</li>
<li>Various items donated by businesses around the country (Children's books, comics, blankets, toys, etc.)</li>
<li>A chat with the ""real"" Superman, photo opportunities, etc. I will be 100% in character the entire time.</li>
<li>The most important thing a hero can give: Hope.</li>
</ul><h2>Who is Dustin Dorough?</h2>
<p>I'm a 25 year old Superman fan, actor, costumer and general do-gooder. I've been active in the costuming community since 2007, though I was born on Halloween, so I've been wearing costumes most of my life. I'm just a comic nerd who wants to share the joy that my heroes brought to me as a child with a younger generation. When I'm not wearing spandex, you can find me working as an emcee for the Spartan Race series (<a href=""http://www.spartanrace.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.spartanrace.com</a>).</p>
<h2>Didn't you already have a fundraiser?</h2>
<p>Why yes, I did! Though, while trying to be EXTRA frugal, I accidentally underestimated the expenses. As the tour has grown, so have the costs associated with it. Not all of the gifts for the children are donated and most of it has to be paid for. I'm going to be visiting multiple thousands of children while on this tour and I don't want any of them to be left behind.<br/><br/>Also, since the original fundraiser began, prices on many essential items (especially fuel costs) have risen significantly. I'm holding this secondary fundraiser to make sure that I don't get stranded in the middle of the desert with no fuel, haha.<br/><br/>These updated costs still do NOT include lodging. In order to keep the costs down for the donors, I have opted to sleep in my car for the entire trip and to shower using my nationwide LA Fitness membership. Hopefully there will be some nice people who offer their sofas along the way, but I'm trying not to rely on it. I just want this tour to happen no matter what inconveniences I have to endure.<br/><br/>If I DON'T meet the fundraising goal, then the trip will just take longer. I AM going to visit these kids if I have to wait for my paychecks to come in while I'm on the road and pay for this out-of-pocket. Your donation would just make things much smoother for everyone involved.</p>
<h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
<p>I'm going on this trip to brighten the lives of thousands of children who are in such desperate need of hope. I feel that the most important duty of any superhero is not so much saving people directly, but rather in inspiring them to save themselves.</p>
<p>The character of Superman has had a profound impact on my life and the way I view the world. He's a man with the power to rule the world, but instead chooses to serve it. He lost his home planet, but chooses to protect ours. He has every reason to be angry, but he lives to inspire others with the sheer power of hope. I feel like Superman is exactly what these kids need when dealing with such intense struggles of their own.</p>
<p>I also often see individuals who truly wish to do great things for others in the most selfless of ways, but unfortunately we live in a world where kindness is immediately cause for ridicule. Far too often do I see someone with good intentions hold back for fear of embarrassment. As part of this tour, I want to help inspire all those who hear of it to remind them that old-fashioned kindness still has a place in the modern world. I want to remind them that it's still okay to be a good person.</p>
<h2>How can I help?</h2>
<p>Monetary donations are certainly appreciated, but I do fully understand that times are tough for a lot of people and they might not be able to give as freely as they would like to.<br/><br/>I will be setting up a P.O. Box next week so that I will be able to receive tangible donations as well. Useful things would be gift cards you hadn't planned on using, gas cards, etc. You can also just send me a letter if you wish.<br/><br/>You can find a list of other ways to help on my Facebook page here: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/notes/dustin-dorough-official/hospital-heroes-how-you-can-help/10151047509598798"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">http://www.facebook.com/notes/dustin-dorough-official/hospital-heroes-how-you-can-help/10151047509598798</a></p>

</h2><p></p><br/>A true artist cannot live in isolation, but I think it would be wrong to state—as many classical musicians seem to have claimed—that a classical musician must live with or even around other classical musicians. If the true artist is living with their Beloved—whoever and whatever that is—and amongst his fellow human beings—then I think those conditions are enough for him to make his art; the truth being that all human beings have within them the capacity of true artistry, and that to live with one’s Beloved is to live with and amongst one’s True Self… which the artist then comes to realize is everywhere, permeates all things, and is in all beings.<p></p><p></p><p></p>This is especially true of the soloist, as I think it has been for soloists throughout history, when I reflect upon the teachings of my musical training. My name is Paul Yeager, and I’m a 32 year old classically trained virtuoso solo violinist. The above video is me performing Eug<em>é</em>ne Ysaÿe’s Third Solo Violin Sonata entitled “Ballade” in a concert I gave at Old First Church, San Francisco, in 2009. Yes, that was me performing 20th century atonal classical music in a zebra pimp jacket from Amsterdam, in a church. ;)<br/><br/><h3>My Musical Background<br/>
</h3><br/>I’ve been studying music and practicing the classical violin since I was five years old, and my first teacher was my mother. My family, though not financially wealthy like many families of classical musicians I’ve known, is from a culturally rich American-European classical music background. I play on a violin which was handed down through the family, which was played on by a great-grandmother with equally-fast fingers apparently. I also had one ancestor who played for a brief time in the courts of a German emperor. My more immediate genetic lineage is littered with European orally-transmitted/“folk” and liturgical music from the protestant and German Evangelical traditions as well as being influenced by ""big band.""“ Sometime in the late 19th-20th century, all that transformed into much more than a democratic majority of both sides of my family being able to read music from the staff (vs. playing by ear). That flowered into a deep appreciation for being educated and spreading education in the classical arts in general, throughout the 20th century, starting with all my great-grandparents and their children, and all that was ultimately and finally transmitted to me. I don’t come from gypsies or Jews strangely (although there’s one or two in the genealogy, however covertly), but I do come from… I guess we might just call it: “a diaspora of high Bohemianism.”<br/><br/>Out of those genes, and my mother teaching violin from the time I was in the womb, I eventually asked when I was 3.5 years old for a “vah-vhan” (my three year old word for “violin”) and it was obvious to my parents what I was asking for. My mother gave me a plastic toy violin to satiate my childish and heartfelt desire, since she knew I was at risk of breaking a real one at that age, so it was later I got a real one when I was five (I had just turned six in the pic below). <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/497780/files/20140409234728-1987PaulVio.jpg?1397112448"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If this were program notes at a classical performance venue—which it’s obviously not—I might continue on here to list all my influential teachers beginning with my mother and ending with some of the classical greats with whom I was fortunate enough to have musical contact, and/or concluding with the fact that I am a certified, registered, and otherwise credentialed Bachelor of Music with supposedly lofty academic connections, but let’s face it; none of that means anything to the new and glorious age I’m grateful to be alive in. <br/><br/><h3>Why I Am Here on Indiegogo<br/>
</h3><br/>I’m a former child prodigy with admittedly some burned bridges in the small-and-insular world of classical music, where <i>you the reader might be quite surprised to know</i> is/was as political as a House of Cards, only sometimes more brutal! I witnessed while growing up a great and sometimes very painful distance between all those hours I spent giving my passion and dedication over the last nearly-three decades for the music I so deeply love VS. the political forces of ""high culture"" which seem to dominate access to the classical stage and recording industry, almost as if ""the limelight"" is a territory fought over by the noble lords of feudal Europe vs. awarded according to passion, skill, and
 work, as many other vocations are in our 21st global century (i.e. see <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/giornovichi-violin-concertos/id383460388"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link to a CD of my Giornovichi Concerto #1</a> , or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Giornovichi-Violin-Concerto-Nos-Vol-2/dp/B000005I8J/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1397201428&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=paul+yeager+giornovichi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link to my Giornovichi Concertos #'s 3 and 9</a> , or <a href=""http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1473015/a/samuel%3A+string+quartets+1%262%2Ftransformations.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this one to my premier of an atonal 20th century work ""Transformations"" by Gerhard Samuel</a><a href=""http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1473015/a/samuel%3A+string+quartets+1%262%2Ftransformations.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> as examples of CD recordings I made between the ages of 12-14 for which I've yet to receive any royalties). <br/><br/>I'm excited to be making my request here on Indiegogo, not only because I'm excited about the opportunity to finally record and sustainably distribute my life's solo works (and with the adult musical maturity I know I now fully possess), but also because I see crowdfunding as a way to heal a serious cultural disparity in the world. That healing I believe, just like the beautiful and rich classical music tradition I carry in my musical identity, is actually the rightful property and privilege of all humankind, and that's why I've been so happy to take part in funding classical musicians via crowdfunding on occasion myself as well! In short, I believe this new funding mechanism inherently shares and embraces my ultimate ideal of classical music becoming universally accessible, and is a great mechanism for achieving that ideal in the world. <br/><br/><h3>The Virtuoso Will Return With Your Help<br/>
</h3><br/>I played as a soloist in front of many symphony orchestras between the ages of eight and fourteen, such as I was below playing Pablo de Sarasate’s “Zigeunerweisen” when I was ten with the Indianapolis Symphony, as a result of winning their solo competition:<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCR0bjkOfYNA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCR0bjkOfYNA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCR0bjkOfYNA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>I also played here when I was a little older (12-14, somewhere in there), playing Max Bruch’s “Scottish Fantasy” with the Northern Kentucky Symphony (click on to youtube to continue watching through all five movements):<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F8eA__MUqbsk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8eA__MUqbsk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F8eA__MUqbsk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>I haven’t even nearly devoted my whole life to music, which many people have found saddening, and a lot of people would say I wasted a big part of my life, especially in my twenties between the beginning and end of my “college days.” But, I will just note that mostly I was having a blast and working hard—however temporarily—at my “live fast, die young” motto of those times. ;p<br/><br/>Now I’m [A LOT] more balanced and have a deep appreciation for the smaller pleasures of life. I’m also newly married to a beautiful and nurturing woman from Northeast India and live in a place I’m proud to call my new home, Bangkok, Thailand. I’m again getting serious about the core/transcendent purpose(s) of my life, let's just say: after some minor bad blows in my home country (America) regarding my ability to live there with my goddess. I’m lucky, fortunate, and otherwise blessed enough to know exactly what the first of all of those possible transcendent purposes is at this very moment, and that’s why <i>I’m here to try and get this one the fuel it’s gonna need to burn</i> on past… hopefully, my own mortal frame or even those of future generations!<br/><br/><h2>
<b>“EXACTLY WHAT MUSIC IS HE TALKING ABOUT?”</b> <br/>
</h2><p>...you’re hopefully now itching to know…</p><h2></h2><br/><p>Recordings of:</p><ul>
<li> My Six J.S. Bach Sonatas and Partitas</li>
<li>My Six Eug<em>é</em>ne Ysaÿe Sonatas. <br/>
</li>
</ul>This is an amount of music any classical violinist would agree is a massive undertaking to record. This will require three Discs/compilations, two in a box for the Bach (“Box for the Bach”—hm, maybe that should be its name) and one for the Six Ysaÿes. I will need to re-immerse myself in daily 8+ hour/day practice sessions for several months in order to achieve this recording feat -to-snuff, while devoting funding towards an epic amount of time in the professional recording studio amidst. And then there's distribution. Regarding distribution, I aim to get the music not only into “more mainstream” channels like iTunes and Amazon, but also where it needs to go to poor and starving people in developing countries where I believe my music specifically and desperately needs to be heard (i.e. via mobilizable organizations I may be able to work with who could potentially leverage that), --and I will also note-- into channels where the music can be consumed more sustainably regardless of even whatever ""force majeure"" sorta events may be likely to occur globally in the 21st century (i.e. via non-fiat currencies like the Swedish kronar or others with sturdy backings, or via electronic currencies where legality abides).<br/><br/><h2>Impacts of Your Donation</h2><br/>Perhaps I'm thinking a tad like a megalomaniac for a minute here (please forgive me if that's the case but I want this is to be perfectly clear in terms of the extent of the Impacts I am aiming for), I’m aiming to get the recordings into channels where I can feel reasonably reassured that if someday, extraterrestrials come to planet earth to dig up the archeological remains of the human race long after it’s destroyed itself, that they might even find my recordings of the J.S. Bach Sonatas and Partitas and Ysaÿe Sonatas, thus adding to their conclusion that human beings “weren’t all bad”… in fact they might even find the CD liner notes where I’ll be making mystical-sounding annotations such as noting the fact that Bach inscribed on every one of his manuscripts “<i>to the glory of God alone</i>,” leaving the aliens wondering why all human beings' didn't develop more in that kind of mystical-creative-immersive direction in their lives, since the music is, well, so pleasurably satisfying to listen to <i>and to create</i>. <br/><br/>Or, perhaps my recordings might have something to do with preventing the destruction of humankind altogether in ways I can't understand or predict! As my mother used to say, “music makes the world go round.” And maybe she was somehow more right than she realized.<br/><br/><h2>Incentives and Perks</h2><br/>SO, here’s some ueber-incentives and perks to funding this: <br/><br/><ul>
<li>By giving $50 USD you’re hereby guaranteed—regarding all three CDs of this monumental amount of solo violin music I will have manifested before 2014 is out—that you will receive all of it First amongst all my funders, and Free of Charge. <br/>
</li>
<li>By giving $25, you’ll receive one of those CDs, my Six Eug<em>é</em>ne Ysaÿe Sonatas.</li>
<li>By giving $10, you will be my friend until and after I am dead and your email will be added to my VIP list.</li>
<li>By giving $5 or more, you will be invited to some huge private party on a tropical island, which might then belong solely to me or some organization in which I am incremental (as a result of the upward spiral you’re no doubt helping into motion by making a donation here), in the year 2023. Of course, we all also have to work at stopping climate change, for this to actually happen.<br/>
</li>
<li>By giving even $1, you are affirming that my life’s deepest work in classical music has not gone to waste, as a mantra, and that’s how my wife will feel about it too;</li>

My family, though not financially wealthy like many families of classical musicians I’ve known, is from a culturally rich American-European classical music background. I play on a violin which was handed down through the family, which was played on by a great-grandmother with equally-fast fingers apparently. I also had one ancestor who played for a brief time in the courts of a German emperor. My more immediate genetic lineage is littered with European orally-transmitted/“folk” and liturgical music from the protestant and German Evangelical traditions as well as being influenced by ""big band.""“ Sometime in the late 19th-20th century, all that transformed into much more than a democratic majority of both sides of my family being able to read music from the staff (vs. playing by ear). That flowered into a deep appreciation for being educated and spreading education in the classical arts in general, throughout the 20th century, starting with all my great-grandparents and their children, and all that was ultimately and finally transmitted to me. I don’t come from gypsies or Jews strangely (although there’s one or two in the genealogy, however covertly), but I do come from… I guess we might just call it: “a diaspora of high Bohemianism.”Out of those genes, and my mother teaching violin from the time I was in the womb, I eventually asked when I was 3.5 years old for a “vah-vhan” (my three year old word for “violin”) and it was obvious to my parents what I was asking for. My mother gave me a plastic toy violin to satiate my childish and heartfelt desire, since she knew I was at risk of breaking a real one at that age, so it was later I got a real one when I was five (I had just turned six in the pic below). If this were program notes at a classical performance venue—which it’s obviously not—I might continue on here to list all my influential teachers beginning with my mother and ending with some of the classical greats with whom I was fortunate enough to have musical contact, and/or concluding with the fact that I am a certified, registered, and otherwise credentialed Bachelor of Music with supposedly lofty academic connections, but let’s face it; none of that means anything to the new and glorious age I’m grateful to be alive in. Why I Am Here on Indiegogo
I’m a former child prodigy with admittedly some burned bridges in the small-and-insular world of classical music, where you the reader might be quite surprised to know is/was as political as a House of Cards, only sometimes more brutal! I witnessed while growing up a great and sometimes very painful distance between all those hours I spent giving my passion and dedication over the last nearly-three decades for the music I so deeply love VS. the political forces of ""high culture"" which seem to dominate access to the classical stage and recording industry, almost as if ""the limelight"" is a territory fought over by the noble lords of feudal Europe vs. awarded according to passion, skill, and
 work, as many other vocations are in our 21st global century (i.e. see this link to a CD of my Giornovichi Concerto #1 , or this link to my Giornovichi Concertos #'s 3 and 9 , or this one to my premier of an atonal 20th century work ""Transformations"" by Gerhard Samuel as examples of CD recordings I made between the ages of 12-14 for which I've yet to receive any royalties). I'm excited to be making my request here on Indiegogo, not only because I'm excited about the opportunity to finally record and sustainably distribute my life's solo works (and with the adult musical maturity I know I now fully possess), but also because I see crowdfunding as a way to heal a serious cultural disparity in the world. That healing I believe, just like the beautiful and rich classical music tradition I carry in my musical identity, is actually the rightful property and privilege of all humankind, and that's why I've been so happy to take part in funding classical musicians via crowdfunding on occasion myself as well! In short, I believe this new funding mechanism inherently shares and embraces my ultimate ideal of classical music becoming universally accessible, and is a great mechanism for achieving that ideal in the world. The Virtuoso Will Return With Your Help
I played as a soloist in front of many symphony orchestras between the ages of eight and fourteen, such as I was below playing Pablo de Sarasate’s “Zigeunerweisen” when I was ten with the Indianapolis Symphony, as a result of winning their solo competition:I also played here when I was a little older (12-14, somewhere in there), playing Max Bruch’s “Scottish Fantasy” with the Northern Kentucky Symphony (click on to youtube to continue watching through all five movements):I haven’t even nearly devoted my whole life to music, which many people have found saddening, and a lot of people would say I wasted a big part of my life, especially in my twenties between the beginning and end of my “college days.” But, I will just note that mostly I was having a blast and working hard—however temporarily—at my “live fast, die young” motto of those times. ;pNow I’m [A LOT] more balanced and have a deep appreciation for the smaller pleasures of life. I’m also newly married to a beautiful and nurturing woman from Northeast India and live in a place I’m proud to call my new home, Bangkok, Thailand. I’m again getting serious about the core/transcendent purpose(s) of my life, let's just say: after some minor bad blows in my home country (America) regarding my ability to live there with my goddess. I’m lucky, fortunate, and otherwise blessed enough to know exactly what the first of all of those possible transcendent purposes is at this very moment, and that’s why I’m here to try and get this one the fuel it’s gonna need to burn on past… hopefully, my own mortal frame or even those of future generations!
“EXACTLY WHAT MUSIC IS HE TALKING ABOUT?” 
...you’re hopefully now itching to know…Recordings of:
 My Six J.S. Bach Sonatas and Partitas
My Six Eugéne Ysaÿe Sonatas. 

This is an amount of music any classical violinist would agree is a massive undertaking to record. This will require three Discs/compilations, two in a box for the Bach (“Box for the Bach”—hm, maybe that should be its name) and one for the Six Ysaÿes. I will need to re-immerse myself in daily 8+ hour/day practice sessions for several months in order to achieve this recording feat -to-snuff, while devoting funding towards an epic amount of time in the professional recording studio amidst. And then there's distribution. Regarding distribution, I aim to get the music not only into “more mainstream” channels like iTunes and Amazon, but also where it needs to go to poor and starving people in developing countries where I believe my music specifically and desperately needs to be heard (i.e. via mobilizable organizations I may be able to work with who could potentially leverage that), --and I will also note-- into channels where the music can be consumed more sustainably regardless of even whatever ""force majeure"" sorta events may be likely to occur globally in the 21st century (i.e. via non-fiat currencies like the Swedish kronar or others with sturdy backings, or via electronic currencies where legality abides).Impacts of Your DonationPerhaps I'm thinking a tad like a megalomaniac for a minute here (please forgive me if that's the case but I want this is to be perfectly clear in terms of the extent of the Impacts I am aiming for), I’m aiming to get the recordings into channels where I can feel reasonably reassured that if someday, extraterrestrials come to planet earth to dig up the archeological remains of the human race long after it’s destroyed itself, that they might even find my recordings of the J.S. Bach Sonatas and Partitas and Ysaÿe Sonatas, thus adding to their conclusion that human beings “weren’t all bad”… in fact they might even find the CD liner notes where I’ll be making mystical-sounding annotations such as noting the fact that Bach inscribed on every one of his manuscripts “to the glory of God alone,” leaving the aliens wondering why all human beings' didn't develop more in that kind of mystical-creative-immersive direction in their lives, since the music is, well, so pleasurably satisfying to listen to and to create. Or, perhaps my recordings might have something to do with preventing the destruction of humankind altogether in ways I can't understand or predict! As my mother used to say, “music makes the world go round.” And maybe she was somehow more right than she realized.Incentives and PerksSO, here’s some ueber-incentives and perks to funding this: 
By giving $50 USD you’re hereby guaranteed—regarding all three CDs of this monumental amount of solo violin music I will have manifested before 2014 is out—that you will receive all of it First amongst all my funders, and Free of Charge. 

By giving $25, you’ll receive one of those CDs, my Six Eugéne Ysaÿe Sonatas.
By giving $10, you will be my friend until and after I am dead and your email will be added to my VIP list.
By giving $5 or more, you will be invited to some huge private party on a tropical island, which might then belong solely to me or some organization in which I am incremental (as a result of the upward spiral you’re no doubt helping into motion by making a donation here), in the year 2023. Of course, we all also have to work at stopping climate change, for this to actually happen.

By giving even $1, you are affirming that my life’s deepest work in classical music has not gone to waste, as a mantra, and that’s how my wife will feel about it too;

</p><h1>Twin Cities 4th Annual Roots, Rock and Deep Blues Festival</h1><h4><i>Patrick's Cabaret needs YOUR help to put on this amazing festival!</i></h4><h4><i>""Best Rock Festival 2014"" as named by City Pages and ""Best Block Party 2014"" as named by Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></h4><p>Patrick's Cabaret is a unique, non-profit arts organization in South Minneapolis, committed to supporting artists in their growth and development. For 28 years, we have encouraged a diverse range of artists to take risks and push boundaries. For 28 years, our audiences have helped us hold the space to make sure every artist has a stage to call their own. We especially reach out to local artists, artists of color, GLBTQ-identified artists, and those with disabilities.</p><p>For the past three years, Patrick's Cabaret has presented the Twin Cities Roots, Rock and Deep Blues Festival - a fundraiser to support our programming throughout the year, ensuring that we can keep our doors open and our stage available to artists of all backgrounds, cultures, experience levels and artistic disciplines.</p><p>This year's Twin Cities Roots, Rock and Deep Blues Festival will take place July 19, 2014, and will feature an impressive array of local, regional and national musical acts on multiple stages at Patrick's Cabaret and the neighboring Harriet Brewing. With visual artists selling their goods, food trucks lining the street, and performers mingling with the crowd, it's an urban festival with a neighborhood feel.</p><p>And because of our reputation for supporting emerging artists, many of the festival's past headliners have performed for much less than they would normally get paid. It's their way of giving back. They understand that Patrick's Cabaret has awfully big dreams for such a small organization. They understand that we need all the help we can get to pull off an event this big.</p><p></p><p>Here is a sample of some of the bands that will be performing 
at this year's festival:</p><p>Sonny Knight &amp; the Lakers</p><p>Black Eyed Snakes </p><p>Kent Burnside &amp; the New Generation (MS)</p><p>Black Market Brass </p><p>Crankshaft &amp; The Gear Grinders</p><p>Erik Koskinen</p><p>i like you</p><p>Mrs Glass (TX)</p><p>Carson McHone (TX)</p><p>Spider John Koerner </p><p>Eleganza</p><p>Mike Gunther</p><p>The 757's</p><p>The Flood Brothers (MO)</p><p>Black Diet</p><p>Molly Maher<br/></p><p>Joe &amp; Vicky Price (IA)<br/></p><p>Kitten Forever<br/></p><p>Ben Balinger (TX)</p><p>Nikki &amp; The Ruemates</p><p>Molly Dean</p><p>The Dead Pigeons <br/></p><p>Dirt Road Ramblers </p><p>There are more to come! Stay tuned!</p><p>If these bands interest you, a $20 donation or higher will reserve your spot at this year's festival!</p><p></p><h4>
<i>What We Will Use the Funds For</i><br/>
</h4><p>We need $10,000 to reach our goal! We will use this money for performers, rent tents, stages, permits, ice, road blocks, tickets, printing, and everything else that goes into mounting a production of this scale.</p><p>The money raised from the festival will be used to support programming at Patrick's Cabaret throughout the year. It will help us continue to showcase artists who challenge, provoke and inspire, and provide audiences access to vibrant, diverse and uncensored performances.</p><p>And that's where YOU come in! Help us put on the best outdoor music festival of the summer,  and you'll not only receive our undying gratitude, but we'll show you all kinds of appreciation!</p><h4><i>Perks for Patrons of the Arts</i></h4><p><b>A Drop in the Bucket (EVERY dollar helps!)</b></p><p><b>$1-4 earns you:</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Our sincere, heartfelt thanks and a warm, fuzzy feeling.

<p></p></div>","Twin Cities 4th Annual Roots, Rock and Deep Blues FestivalPatrick's Cabaret needs YOUR help to put on this amazing festival!""Best Rock Festival 2014"" as named by City Pages and ""Best Block Party 2014"" as named by Minneapolis Star TribunePatrick's Cabaret is a unique, non-profit arts organization in South Minneapolis, committed to supporting artists in their growth and development. For 28 years, we have encouraged a diverse range of artists to take risks and push boundaries. For 28 years, our audiences have helped us hold the space to make sure every artist has a stage to call their own. We especially reach out to local artists, artists of color, GLBTQ-identified artists, and those with disabilities.For the past three years, Patrick's Cabaret has presented the Twin Cities Roots, Rock and Deep Blues Festival - a fundraiser to support our programming throughout the year, ensuring that we can keep our doors open and our stage available to artists of all backgrounds, cultures, experience levels and artistic disciplines.This year's Twin Cities Roots, Rock and Deep Blues Festival will take place July 19, 2014, and will feature an impressive array of local, regional and national musical acts on multiple stages at Patrick's Cabaret and the neighboring Harriet Brewing. With visual artists selling their goods, food trucks lining the street, and performers mingling with the crowd, it's an urban festival with a neighborhood feel.And because of our reputation for supporting emerging artists, many of the festival's past headliners have performed for much less than they would normally get paid. It's their way of giving back. They understand that Patrick's Cabaret has awfully big dreams for such a small organization. They understand that we need all the help we can get to pull off an event this big.Here is a sample of some of the bands that will be performing 
at this year's festival:Sonny Knight & the LakersBlack Eyed Snakes Kent Burnside & the New Generation (MS)Black Market Brass Crankshaft & The Gear GrindersErik Koskineni like youMrs Glass (TX)Carson McHone (TX)Spider John Koerner EleganzaMike GuntherThe 757'sThe Flood Brothers (MO)Black DietMolly MaherJoe & Vicky Price (IA)Kitten ForeverBen Balinger (TX)Nikki & The RuematesMolly DeanThe Dead Pigeons Dirt Road Ramblers There are more to come! Stay tuned!If these bands interest you, a $20 donation or higher will reserve your spot at this year's festival!
What We Will Use the Funds For

We will use this money for performers, rent tents, stages, permits, ice, road blocks, tickets, printing, and everything else that goes into mounting a production of this scale.The money raised from the festival will be used to support programming at Patrick's Cabaret throughout the year.

<h3>
<br/>Welcome to my Indiegogo Campaign!</h3>
<p><br/>Since I was a little girl (very little, littler than I am now), I've been singing and writing music as often as I can. I sang in the car, I sang in the shower, I sang when my mom really wanted me to be quiet. Music seemed like this incredible, beautiful language that I somehow just knew, and I always wanted more and more of it. And so, one day, I decided I would have more of it.</p>
<p><br/>I've been performing for a couple of years now. I started with parties-- singing for people I felt comfortable with, and then eventually moved on to open mics, where I began to feel comfortable playing my original songs for people. I had my first solo gig on May 26th, 2012, at a café called Java Madness. I brought in more people (and money) than any of their performers to this date. Since then, I've played several more shows, performed at parties, jam sessions, new open mics.</p>
<p><br/>Over the summer, my good friend and fellow musician, Eric Darcy, had a friend visiting from Nashville. This friend, Chris Stone, happened to be a producer and sound engineer. Eric had me play some music for Chris, and before I could blink twice, I was on the phone with Eric planning a trip to Nashville to record my demo CD.</p>
<h2>
<br/>This fundraiser campaign is my ticket to Nashville. </h2>
<p><br/>My whole life, music has been steady and constant and beautiful, without falter. I can hear it on the highway, in the clocks, on the subway, in the wheels of a bicycle, in your breathing, in the mountains. Everywhere. Through music, I've heard the sounds of people's hearts, of their tragedies and their happiest days, of their hardships and their victories. And with my voice, I have been able to let people hear my own, and I want to keep doing that. Cheese-ball as it all is-- music is a universal language that everybody can hear and understand. I want to be part of that web where people communicate with these sounds. Think about when you heard your favorite song for the first time; that feeling is the feeling I get every time I write a song, or perform for people, and I want to give people that feeling with my music. With support from my mother, my sister and my friends and fans, I have been able to pursue my music with dedication and passion. And with support from you, I will be able to take the next step in sharing my music with you and the rest of the world.</p>

Welcome to my Indiegogo Campaign!
Since I was a little girl (very little, littler than I am now), I've been singing and writing music as often as I can. I sang in the car, I sang in the shower, I sang when my mom really wanted me to be quiet. Music seemed like this incredible, beautiful language that I somehow just knew, and I always wanted more and more of it. And so, one day, I decided I would have more of it.
I've been performing for a couple of years now. I started with parties-- singing for people I felt comfortable with, and then eventually moved on to open mics, where I began to feel comfortable playing my original songs for people. I had my first solo gig on May 26th, 2012, at a café called Java Madness. I brought in more people (and money) than any of their performers to this date. Since then, I've played several more shows, performed at parties, jam sessions, new open mics.
Over the summer, my good friend and fellow musician, Eric Darcy, had a friend visiting from Nashville. This friend, Chris Stone, happened to be a producer and sound engineer. Eric had me play some music for Chris, and before I could blink twice, I was on the phone with Eric planning a trip to Nashville to record my demo CD.

This fundraiser campaign is my ticket to Nashville. 
My whole life, music has been steady and constant and beautiful, without falter. I can hear it on the highway, in the clocks, on the subway, in the wheels of a bicycle, in your breathing, in the mountains. Everywhere. Through music, I've heard the sounds of people's hearts, of their tragedies and their happiest days, of their hardships and their victories. And with my voice, I have been able to let people hear my own, and I want to keep doing that. Cheese-ball as it all is-- music is a universal language that everybody can hear and understand. I want to be part of that web where people communicate with these sounds. Think about when you heard your favorite song for the first time; that feeling is the feeling I get every time I write a song, or perform for people, and I want to give people that feeling with my music. With support from my mother, my sister and my friends and fans, I have been able to pursue my music with dedication and passion. And with support from you, I will be able to take the next step in sharing my music with you and the rest of the world.

What We Need & What You Get

couldn't part with it and, moreover, decided that I would instead start 
taking lessons! A 20-year break from practicing definitely took its 
toll, but I was astonished to realize how much I remembered, both 
physically and mentally. Over the past year, I have been gradually 
restoring my skills, and this is due in no small part to joining the

hiatus was a little scary to me, but being a part of an orchestra that 
is low in stress and high in comradery has made it quite fun. I’m very 
much enjoying the friendships that I have developed as a result of 
joining the orchestra, and I look forward to growing with the orchestra

<h3>Opera Competition and Master Class in Spain!</h3>
<div>
<div>
<p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
<p>A month ago I got the great news that I was selected to participate in the International Opera Competition hosted by Soprano Monserrat Caballé in Zaragoza, Spain as well as the Master Classes that follow, having one-on-one training with Madame Caballé.</p>
<p>As a young Venezuelan Tenor living in Miami, it is an immense and amazing opportunity to be selected to be part of this competition and training. It will open a lot of doors and opportunities in the future and non of this could have happened with the support and encouragement I have gotten from everyone throughout this long journey that I have partaken so far. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As you may know, applying, traveling, and competing in all these various places takes a lot of time and money which I have had the priviledge of having thus far.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Process and how You can help me!</span></strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now, the trip to Spain will be for about 2 weeks and there will be two main parts to this competition.</p>
<p>As part of the international competition, they have picked singers from all over the world to compete against each other in a 5 day process of elimination. I have the honor of being part of the singers picked! Each singer goes through three rounds until they reach the finals where, if chosen, I would have the opportunity to win a cash prize ranging from 3,000 euros to 12,000 euros. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The second part of this invitation is the Master Classes that I will be taking personally with Madame Caballé. These are training sessions, in front of an audience, that include training and critique on various aspects of a selection that I would be singing for her. This is what I am most excited about! The chance to meet and get coaching from one of the greatest sopranos in opera that has ever sung. Getting picked to be part of the Master Class is a priviledge and an incredible opportunity.</p>
<p>At the end of these two weeks, Madame Caballé will hand pick a few singers from the competition and master classes to sing in a concert with her and singers from all over the world. </p>
<p>With all that said, now I would like to ask for your support. I will be leaving September 8th and staying in Zaragoza until the 20th. The invitation does not cover any expenses that include airfare, lodging, and living over in Zaragoza. So that means that I will have a month to raise as much money as I can that will aid me in this journey. </p>
<p>I know it is a lot to ask but any support you can give me, including words of encouragement, is well recieved and appreciated as well as spreading the word to everyone and attending future performances that I have planned locally in the fall!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for you time and support!!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi guys, my names Fabio. Im 17 years old and from a town called Eastbourne in East Sussex, UK! I was born in Wales, then moved down south with my family at aged 3. My parents broke up when i was 8 and moved across town to another house with my mum. I now currently live in a flat with my mum. She doesn't have a job and is finding it really hard to live. Im trying my hardest to get a job but they're so hard to find these days for a part time job.</p>
<p>My dad was in the music business back in the 70s, and hes really keen for me to follow in his footsteps. So am i! Music is my passion and to be in the music business is a dream for me.</p>
<p>I play drums, and i got my first drum kit when i was 8. However, the drum kit is at my dads house, who now lives about an hour away out of town, and whenever i tried to play, the neighbours complained. I was forced to take the drum kit down, and i haven't been able to play it in 3 years. </p>
<p>This was very upsetting for both me and my dad. The only chance to get to play the drums is once a week during my drum lessons. I love playing the drums. Its the only thing i consider myself to be good at. This campaign is so important to me, because without my drums and my music, I wouldn't see much point in waking up in the mornings.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The funding i would love to recieve is around £700. This is would be the perfect amount for a mid-ranged Tama drum kit i found online for about £500. It looks so nice, i cant stop looking at pictures and watching videos of it. The rest of the money would go on to book time at a practice room so i would have a place to play and practice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel i have a natural flare for drumming. and if this compaign were to come true and i were to get the drum kit, my hope is to make a Youtube channel where i would make drum cover videos. I love to entertain people, so making drum covers on Youtube and getting viewers would be so amazing!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel the project is, first off, exetremely valuable to me. Im not just a 17 year old boy wanting money for doing nothing. This is me trying to chase my dream, and, with your help, i'll be one step closer to accomplishing the things i've only ever dreamt about.</p>
<p>If i were to recieve any money at all after the campaign, i would post videos on Youtube about my progress and make sure all of you guys knew where your money had gone :)</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if i weren't to recieve any money, if ANY of you are involved with music production, sound engineering or anything to do with recording studios and session musicianship, i would love to have the opportunity to come and experience it!</p>

<p><span>Transcendent Pathways was conceived because I knew there were people out there that felt alone and isolated due to health conditions, and I knew that music could help them feel connected again.  I knew music could remind them that there were people out there that cared and hadn’t forgotten them.  I want to set up a system that collects donations, that go to hiring concert musicians to play music for people in places like children’s hospitals, nursing homes, institutions for the mentally ill, any place where people might feel alone and forgotten.  I think that music can alleviate these feelings, and remind people that they are never alone.  </span></p>
<p>The goal of TP is to champion these qualities through music.  And it all starts with this concert during mental illness awareness week.  On October 7th at SFCM, TP will hold its debut concert and will feature top notch local groups such as Magik Magik Orchestra and Nonsemble 6.  </p>

<p>I'm thrilled with this album and want to make sure it gets heard. 
I've learned the hard way that if you don't promote an album well, very 
few people even learn that it is available. But it takes money to 
promote an album well. It costs thousands of dollars to do publicity or 
send songs to just one radio format, for instance. Here's <a href=""http://bit.ly/SFRSFOM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">what I'm hoping to do next at radio</a>.
 There's a great team excited about helping me make sure this album gets
 noticed but I've had to turn many of them down because I can't afford 
them. </p>
<p>That's where you come in. You could look for the album in stores but 
you'll get fewer songs, none of the extras and you won't get the higher 
quality audio files that are included in the downloads here. <a href=""http://bit.ly/whybdcrowdfunds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's
 why this model works better and is essential to my getting to interact

something for everyone. Each one has a different delivery date so you'll

<p></p></span><h4></h4>
<h3>Why have you set your goal so low?</h3>
<p>Indiegogo charges higher fees if I don't reach my goal. So, I set a low goal in hopes of exceeding it and paying lower fees.</p>
<h3>Can I participate even if I don't live in the United States?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I’ve had such great experiences with my international
 audience and I want you involved. Plus, the guy who helped me put this 
campaign together is a Canadian and he’s helped me figure out how to 
make it easier for you be a part.</p>
<p>You can choose any of the perks that are delivered by e-mail (Reports
 From The Soul Furnace, Digital Album Download, Let's Talk, etc.) 
without any extra cost. </p>
<p>There are some extra shipping costs, compared to mailing the same 
items to an address in the United States, if you choose a perk that is 
rewarded by mailing you something -- CDs, shirts, etc. So, you can 
simply add a bit to your pledge to cover those costs. I’ll trust you to 
be fair when estimating that amount. Here are some typical <strong>extra costs</strong> for shipping one CD to these countries:</p>
<p><strong>Canada &amp; Australia:</strong> $1.50-2.00 extra for one CD</p>
<p><strong>United Kingdom:</strong> $4-4.50 extra for one CD</p>
<p><strong>Netherlands:</strong> $3 extra for one CD</p>
<p><strong>Japan:</strong> $3 extra for one CD</p>
<p>If you choose a reward package that involves travel you’ll be responsible for the travel costs.</p>
<h3>Can I give the album or other perks to my friends?</h3>
<p>You betcha! Indiegogo allows you specify who you want the perk sent 
to and indicate that it is a gift. You can even include a note for the 
recipient of your gift.</p>
<h3>What do you need for concert rewards?</h3>
<p>It's pretty basic: You provide a sound system suitable for the size 
of audience and venue, along with a keyboard, an acoustic/electric 
guitar and two direct in boxes/connections.</p>
<p>My accommodation needs are simple too: One hotel room (two for 
Christmas concerts), meals and transportation to/from the airport. 
Additional travel costs will apply if you do not live within 90 minutes 
of a major U.S. hub airport that offers direct flights from Los Angeles.</p>
<h3>Can you tell me more about the estimated delivery dates?</h3>
<p><span>If I can send your 
rewards earlier than estimated cost-effectively, I will. I'll work hard 
to get your perks to you as quickly as possible after I receive payment 
from Indiegogo. PayPal payments happen fairly quickly but credit card 
payments aren't processed until several business days after the campaign
 closes. Some perks, especially those that involve travel, will require a bit more time to schedule but we’ll work that out together.</span></p>
<h3>What happens if you don't reach your goal?</h3>
<p>You'll still get whatever perk you've selected. I'll have to pay 
higher fees to Indiegogo if I don't reach the goal but you'll still get 
everything.</p>
<h3>How can I help with this campaign?</h3>
<p>There's lots you can do in addition to backing this campaign and 
sharing this page. Any comments you post help raise the profile of this 
page. <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/IAmASoulMan?a=945004"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Christopher Redner</a> created <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/groups/113932668758007/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a Facebook group, which you can join, to help you learn how to increase your social media impact</a>.

Christmas concerts), meals and transportation to/from the airport. 
Additional travel costs will apply if you do not live within 90 minutes 
of a major U.S. hub airport that offers direct flights from Los Angeles.
Can you tell me more about the estimated delivery dates?
If I can send your 
rewards earlier than estimated cost-effectively, I will. I'll work hard 
to get your perks to you as quickly as possible after I receive payment 
from Indiegogo. PayPal payments happen fairly quickly but credit card 
payments aren't processed until several business days after the campaign
 closes. Some perks, especially those that involve travel, will require a bit more time to schedule but we’ll work that out together.
What happens if you don't reach your goal?
You'll still get whatever perk you've selected. I'll have to pay 
higher fees to Indiegogo if I don't reach the goal but you'll still get 
everything.
How can I help with this campaign?
There's lots you can do in addition to backing this campaign and 
sharing this page. Any comments you post help raise the profile of this 
page. Christopher Redner created a Facebook group, which you can join, to help you learn how to increase your social media impact. He'll be sharing examples of how to be more effective on the social media campaign for Conversations. You can also send Christopher a message here if you'd like to be added to my Indiegogo campaign team (see the group below).
What if I have a question that isn't answered here or want a perk that isn't offered?
Send me a message. There is a big ""Send User A Message"" button on my Indiegogo profile page.",9.0,0,"42 Campaigns

<h3><b>What is this project?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">“Finding
Asia in America”</i> is a Winter Term photography
project planned out by a group of 7 students from Oberlin College, Oberlin, OH. Although inspired by <i>Humans of New York</i>, it concentrates on the struggles faced by
Asians and Asian-Americans living in the U.S. The project will be from January
12<sup>th</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup>, including  an excursion to New York and a
photography exhibition in Oberlin. From January 12<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup>,
we will visit Asian-American communities in New York City to take photos and
hear their stories. From the 19<sup>th</sup> to 28<sup>th</sup>, we will return
to school to prepare for the <u>project exhibition</u> that will take place in
the beginning of February here in Oberlin. Besides having an exhibition, we
will also share our project on Facebook so that it will acknowledge and empower
not only the Oberlin community but also others around the country and the
world. </p>

<p><b>Hello, we are Sprockets a Alternative Punk, Rock band from
Boise, ID / Las Vegas, NV.</b></p>
<p>We aim to create an on going way to raise funds for children charities meaning every album or song that creates revenue of any kind will donate a percentage to a children's charity. A little bit about us, we are a three piece band who have achieved many accomplishments
in our musical career including “Uniformed Mascara” on NBC’s season two finale
of “Life”, “Safety Nets &amp; Fastened Windows” on CMJ.com’s Download This,
2011 Billboards Next Big Sound and “Your Infection” was a Grammy Nominated
Contender for Best Indie Rock song in the 55<sup>th</sup> Grammy’s. </p>
<p>We want to get back to the studio to create an album that produces funds for people who need it rather then labels who don't even share it with the artist. In other words we need YOUR help. We feel very strongly about the music we have written, yet to record. They are by far the best songs we have written to date. I
know together we can scale new uncharted mountains. </p>
<p><b>WHAT I NEED THE MONEY FOR:</b></p>
<p>There are many steps to recording an album and every step cost
money, the better the quality the more it costs. Step one is already done, we
have written the songs next is getting to the studio which we are looking to record in Bremerton, WA at Mike Herrera’s Monkey Trench Studios which is where we
recorded “Medicated Empty” in 2009. We then track all the musical instruments
and vocals, we send it to mixing and mastering which is a long and
tedious process. Once we have a final product we have to get artwork and albums
printed in cd and vinyl. EVERY ALBUM / VINYL SOLD WILL DONATE A PERCENTAGE TO A CHILDREN'S CHARITY. </p>
<p>But unfortunately, pressing even limited quantities of vinyl
just isn't cheap. Neither is pressing CD's or hiring artists to make these
things look nice. And don't even get me started on how much it costs to ship a
few hundred vinyl records. If this campaign is successful we are aiming to
release this in by the end of 2014. </p>
<p>The amount of money we are trying to raise will pay everything
above and travel from Washington to Home. Most of the bonuses are coming out of
our pockets. No skimping here, my friends.</p>
<p><b>WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN</b></p>
<p>Ok…even at the lowest level of monetary support, you'll be
offered the chance to enjoy a digital copy of the New Sprockets album before
the general public hears it. We will post short clips of us recording the album
on selected sites, so you will be there with us as we record seeing the process
from the ground up. These are exclusive to the backers of this project, and
will disappear shortly after this campaign is over. </p>
<p>But besides those things, at various levels of support, you'll
get the chance to have:</p>
<p>•<span>

This past year I was fortunate to meet and partner with, my friend and fellow musician, Jeff Pruet. Jeff plays a variety of instruments such as ukulele and guitar. Jeff also sings and has helped me record many of the demos you can hear on my SoundCloud page. Our sound is unique and described as dreamy and haunting.Jeff Pruet playing his ukulele. I have also had the pleasure of working with sound engineers Albert Rothstein and Jamie Sego, who are also based in Florence. Albert volunteered much of his time, and recorded a few of the tracks heard on SoundCloud. I've collaborated with some very talented musicians, like Kate Hunt (violin) and Evan Lane (Percussion) and Dylan LeBlanc, who will soon be releasing a third record of his own, ""Cautionary Tale"". Dylan sings vocals and plays guitar on my album. With the help of friends & family, my community, talented musicians, engineers and producers, we have produced high-quality recordings in a professional studio environment. All of this support and inspiration has brought me to the point of making my very first record!Kate Hunt plays violin at Single Lock Records - April 2015
Albert Rothstein and Jamie Sego - April 2015My goal for the release of the album is June 2016.  My highest hope is to be able to share my music with listeners and the world. I would absolutely love for YOU to be the reason I am able to share these songs! The more support the album gains, the more I will be able to promote, share and market this record. I have received a great deal of support from talented musicians, engineers, and producers offering their services at manageable costs. I am hoping to raise money to afford proper services for sharing and producing my music. I will continue to support others in my community and industry by using local services, which I am lucky to access here in Florence, Alabama.For approximately $10,000.00 I will be able to give these songs the production and distribution they deserve - but much more will be spent trying to ensure success.I appreciate your time and support. Thank you for listening!- Jenny Marie Keris",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

The challenge of making high-quality music without a label is only possible through hard work and support from fans, friends and family. So thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!I hope you feel inspired by my music and help make this album a physical reality. Apart from your financial support and choosing a wicked awesome perk, you can also support by sharing this campaign on social media through the Indiegogo links, the videos, and spreading the word the old-fashioned way.Much Love!Buckman",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

This campaign is for a very special project for us, we plan to make a music video for our song 'Been Around'. We met up with an amazing Production team, Electric Legend Pictures, to help create a unique and fun concept for our song, that truly encompasses our style! Along with the music video any remaining money you donate will help us with our dream to move to San Francisco, we need help finding practice space for the band and promote our music so we can bring sweet sweet melodies to the ears of San Franciscans everywhere! By contributing to this campaign you are helping us get one step closer to our dream!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $1500 to reach our goal.

<p>Things this money will go to:</p>
<p>-Cast and Crew:</p>
<p>    We need to pay the production team for all their hard work in this music video, including Grip and Electric, Actors, Production Designers, and Makeup Artists. </p>

<p>-Equipment and Location:</p>
<p>   Lights, Cameras, and Mobile Homes! We need to not only pay the crew to operate the equipment, but pay for the equipment itself, which includes renting a grip truck, a RED Scarlet Camera.

One evening, deep in a dark basement, we decided to make a mock EP. For some odd reason, people liked it. Recently we were asked if we like to perform live, and WE WOULD, that is, if we had the money to do so. That brings us to now. 1/3rd of the band is employed (in an unpaid internship might I add.) So we've come here to IndieGoGo essentially begging for assistance. That's where you come in. We really only need $100 to cover the costs of performing, but anything more than that would be used to produce an actual EP and acquire some better gear.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3>Hey, guys! My name is Jackie Gomez, and my artist name is ArwenStarsong. I am a small town girl from Madera California with a huge passion for music. I have always loved music since I was a little kid. I would always be singing somewhere, whether it was in a choir or on a stage or talent show or karaoke. I have been into writing music since about my senior year of high school, but I have only started to publish my work this past year. Most of what I do is a variety of genres, but I am mostly a Rock/Metal singer. I am all by myself. I write all the music and the lyrics with no band or help from a company. I am entirely self-produced and self promoted. :). I currently am going to Fresno State and majoring in Theatre Arts (Acting) and I have also released one Self-Produced album, Starsong and one single, Fracture. I have a small youtube channel (ArwenStarsong) that I also wish to use to try and make money not only to keep myself stable, but to give back to charity as well! I am currently trying to produce my 2nd album, but as of now I am beginning to have a little difficulty with the current equipment I own. If I could have any sort of help, I could produce something that is better sounding and I can use the power and magick of music to give back to the community and to live my dream: to spread the joy that is music. Unfortunately, I am unable to afford better equipment because the job market has not been kind to me. I work a seasonal job but it is not enough to get by and I have been trying to get a part time job, but school and rehearsals for school make it hard.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>All I need to do is purchase better equipment or a better space and equipment to record with. I also need to advertise myself till I can get me a stable paying job or a record deal.<br/>I need:<br/>-a microphone that can withstand my aggressive vocal style (screaming, too)<br/>-filters<br/>-stands for the micorphone (or mic arm)<br/>-acoustic paneling<br/>-a better recording program<br/>-a video camera (for youtube and commercial purposes)<br/>-a pair of better headphones<br/>-CD's to distribute<br/>-advertising<br/><br/>Any leftover money will be donated to charity :)<br/><br/>You get-<br/>-free copies of my music (digital, since making the covers and stuff won't come till later)<br/>-free DVDS of all my music videos (or digital copies)<br/>-credits in my music videos because you contributed to help me make the music<br/>-my undying gratitude<br/>-signed photos (cause I model, too)<br/>-if I run into you in person, we shall selfie! &lt;3! #selfie #thankyou<br/>-if you have a youtube, your channel will be mentioned in my videos in the credits (just leave your channel name and link for the description box as well)<br/>-to help donate money to charity as well.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I want to get my music out there. Anything you give will help me make it better sounding and get me out there more!

</div></div>","Short SummaryHey, guys! My name is Jackie Gomez, and my artist name is ArwenStarsong. I am a small town girl from Madera California with a huge passion for music. I have always loved music since I was a little kid. I would always be singing somewhere, whether it was in a choir or on a stage or talent show or karaoke. I have been into writing music since about my senior year of high school, but I have only started to publish my work this past year. Most of what I do is a variety of genres, but I am mostly a Rock/Metal singer. I am all by myself. I write all the music and the lyrics with no band or help from a company. I am entirely self-produced and self promoted. :). I currently am going to Fresno State and majoring in Theatre Arts (Acting) and I have also released one Self-Produced album, Starsong and one single, Fracture. I have a small youtube channel (ArwenStarsong) that I also wish to use to try and make money not only to keep myself stable, but to give back to charity as well! I am currently trying to produce my 2nd album, but as of now I am beginning to have a little difficulty with the current equipment I own. If I could have any sort of help, I could produce something that is better sounding and I can use the power and magick of music to give back to the community and to live my dream: to spread the joy that is music. Unfortunately, I am unable to afford better equipment because the job market has not been kind to me. I work a seasonal job but it is not enough to get by and I have been trying to get a part time job, but school and rehearsals for school make it hard.
  What We Need & What You GetAll I need to do is purchase better equipment or a better space and equipment to record with. I also need to advertise myself till I can get me a stable paying job or a record deal.I need:-a microphone that can withstand my aggressive vocal style (screaming, too)-filters-stands for the micorphone (or mic arm)-acoustic paneling-a better recording program-a video camera (for youtube and commercial purposes)-a pair of better headphones-CD's to distribute-advertisingAny leftover money will be donated to charity :)You get--free copies of my music (digital, since making the covers and stuff won't come till later)-free DVDS of all my music videos (or digital copies)-credits in my music videos because you contributed to help me make the music-my undying gratitude-signed photos (cause I model, too)-if I run into you in person, we shall selfie! <3! #selfie #thankyou-if you have a youtube, your channel will be mentioned in my videos in the credits (just leave your channel name and link for the description box as well)-to help donate money to charity as well.
  The ImpactI want to get my music out there. Anything you give will help me make it better sounding and get me out there more! Your donation will not only help me live my dream, but it will also help me be able to give to those in need! I want to use the power of music to encourage people to not only live their dreams, but to love themselves and love others as well. Giving back to the community has always been my biggest passion besides music and I want to use whatever I make to not only pay off my tuition for college, but to donate to cancer research, autism awareness, animal shelters, and hospitals. :) You''ll help me live my big dream of being a performer AND you will help those in need! and your contributions will all be deeply appreciated and ENTIRELY used for these purposes!
  Risks & ChallengesThe music business is tough. I know it is. I have been trying for years to get myself out there, but all I need is your help, world. If you cannot donate, please just share the link to this campaign! It will help get the word out! I know if I just put my heart fully in and sound better, I can get out there and hopefully beat the tough competition.

<p>Josh has signed a deal with Kent Wells Productions and Go
Time Records (GTR) in Nashville to produce Josh's next CD, featuring all
original songs. Kent Wells has been Dolly Parton's bandleader and guitar player
for 25 years. His production company has produced several of Dolly Parton's
CDs, including her new offering “Blue Smoke”. Kent feels that Josh has the
musical talent and work ethic to be a successful recording artist. It is a true
statement of his confidence in Josh that Kent would choose to work with a 19
year old on his first professional musical venture.</p>

While this is an exciting opportunity for Josh,
it requires financing for the production of the CD and to do appropriate
promotion of the CD once it is completed. For that reason we are reaching out
to those that know Josh and appreciate his talent to help provide financial
support for this effort. Josh is looking for donors to contribute to help
offset the costs involved with this effort.<br/><br/><p>Josh has built a strong and loyal following and has done
many shows in the greater Baltimore area. He is the youngest inductee into the
Maryland Country Music Legends Hall of Fame. He has been featured in local
newspaper and magazine articles. </p>
<p>Josh has the talent, drive and desire to be a successful
musician. This incredible opportunity can help him reach that goal, but he
needs the financial backing for this endeavor. Thank you for considering
contributing to this project.</p>

Please, make a contribution to support this project. We

We're excited about the outcome so far, but we've come to a point where we are exhausting our capital.

He was created as art and to present a genre of music Paul holds close to his heart. We will be posting Paul's and Pearly's bios for you to look over. Paul's was written by Juno award winner and Americana/Roots icon Fred Eaglesmith. Here goes...</p><p>Who is PAUL O'TOOLE ... <br/>​ <br/>​""Paul O'Toole comes out of Norfolk County, southern Ontario. Ironically, one of the bible belts of Ontario. He's a guitar playing ex-rockabilly icon, playing for years in bands such as ""The Kil'billys"", ""Kingspeed"" and ""Dangerous Stairs"". He's got a deep growly voice and the hard-assed level stare of not enough sleep and too much substance. His friends call him ""The Old One"". He's danced with the National Ballet of Canada. He's been in Nashville. He's an award winning songwriter. He's been in rehab, back out again, back in trouble and back out again. He hasn't fit in. He hasn't fit in the way that artists don't fit in. He's been on the path of soul-searching and the quest for integrity and his own personal values. Paul has left the rockabilly scene, quit the substance and quit the fast lane. He traded it all for his soul. Every time you hear Paul O'Toole, that's what you hear - his soul. He bleeds all over the stage, the way any smoky lounge singer bleeds when they sing. He invokes images of Willie P. Bennett or Tom Wilson, Greg Brown or even Tom Waits. He is a great songwriter and has a knack for putting you in his world. He has a powerful, powerful voice and he can deliver a song in only the way true experience can. Paul O'Toole is a force, that soon everyone will be reckoning with"". <br/>​ <br/>And now, Pearly...</p><p>Pearly Jenkins BIO</p><p>Who is Pearly Jenkins? <br/>Pearly Jenkins comes out of the ""deep south"" of Canada... on the Northshore of Lake Erie. A little rural place, out of the way called Walsh Station. Nestled between Turkey Point and Vittoria in beautiful Norfolk County. <br/>He started his singin' career at a young age singin' all the rockabilly hits he could think of. The fillin' station he resided at had it's share of characters. Some from North Carolina. They came to cure the tobacco, which was the crop of choice in the area. Thru some of these characters and some talented locals, he was able to experience all kinds of music but primarily country, bluegrass, rockabilly and blues. He gravitated to this and vowed to carry the music he loved so much to the masses. A great and heavy decision for such a young boy. <br/>As the years went by he has grown into an amazing performer and songwriter. Known to write and record a song a day, his catalog is vast. Years of performing, pretty much ""anywhere'd they'd listen"" has made him a wanted force in the live music arena. Pearly Jenkins has shared the stage with Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Merle Haggard, Jack Dekeyzer, Tom Wilson (Blackie and the Rodeo Kings), Fred Eaglesmith, Washboard Hank, Chili Taylor, Dirt Broke and the Poorboys, David Lee Murphy, The Dixie Flyers, Bighouse and many, many more... <br/>His new project is a collection of songs to be recorded and produced by the wildly talented record producer, Glen Marshall. Glen has seen something in Pearly that he deems a special and artful twist on classic musical genres. <br/>The album is slated for release, when the album is slated for release. You will be informed at that time. <br/>Keep an ear out for Pearly. He just might change your life a little... He'll definately delight.</p><p>Loyal Fans...<br/><br/>There has been some question as to who <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pearlyjenkins68"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pearly Jenkins</a> is, and why he is. Pearly is a creation. That's what I do, I create. I'm not hiding or trying to run away from anything or anyone. He was very spontaneously conceived, as an outlet for nothing more than creativity, and has allowed me to achieve and surpass my venture into a genre of music I hold very close to my heart. All the background of Paul O'Toole is still there. The hellish years. The clawing back years. If it wasn't for Paul O'Toole, the character wouldn't exist nor would the art and music.<br/>I've been asked for a back story for Pearly. I have laboured over this and with a little help from a great friend, realised that he already has a back story. It's mine! The rock'n'roll. The singer/songwriter. The alcoholism and drug addiction. The family... lost and found. The heartbreak and the complete love. Clawing my way back from hell and standing tall. Learning how to live again... It's all mine.<br/>I have been overwhelmed at the response this idea has brought me. I appreciate every bit of it.<br/>For those wondering and asking... <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/glenmarshallproducer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glen Marshall</a> and I are working very hard in the studio to bring you a work like no other.

Tour markets include major venues in Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, Lubbock, Tempe, AZ, Anaheim, CA, West Hollywood, CA, Las Vegas, NV, Sacramento, CA, Boise, ID and Seattle, with a few more dates yet to be announced



The Push
To help support the tour, we will relaunch our EP, ""Goodnight California"" with two new songs ""Hey God” and ""Attitude"", three new videos - ""To Be Loved and A'Live"" , ""I Hate You"" (performance video) and ""Since You've Been Gone"" (concept video) and new packaging and artwork. 

Touring Isn't Cheap
As you can imagine, a tour this major isn't cheap.

Rockett Queen Bio


Storming out of East Texas, Rockett Queen burst onto the scene in 2003 and has since been a force with which to be reckoned.

<p>Individually our backgrounds are different, but we come together in building creatively for hip hop. Just 2 out of the box thinkers overcoming doubt &amp; taking action!<br/></p>
<p> We met 3 years ago through a mutual friend, &amp; since have build a 
friendship that led to multiple jam sessions, shows &amp; opportunities 
together within the Orlando scene. As individual artist Our styles don't fit any particular mold &amp; we want to share that with as many people as we can. For the past 10 years we have been practicing, performing anywhere from living rooms, churches, coffee shops, festivals &amp; clubs. Though we have separately seen slight notoriety from sites such as Rapzilla, GrindTime Now, &amp; Vice.com we know this is only the first step towards a long journey. That reality is what makes this the process a little scary, but that's ok. We represent the generalities that are true in all of us, the fears, the visions, People with a past &amp; a present. We want to share our perspective the only way we know how.<br/></p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get
</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We have managed to finance our studio time with top notch producers, so you're promised a quality sound (thank GOD). Your role is so important because you're helping us materialize it!<br/></p>
<p>The funds will be used exclusively to distribute
 and promote the EP And the more money we raise, the more YOU get. <br/></p>
<p>To be more specific, here is how the funds will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover Art, Logo and Manufacturing of the EP: <br/>
</li>
<li>Promotion (Listening Party, Flyers etc) <br/>
</li>
<li>Merchandise (T-Shirts, stickers, buttons etc)<br/>
</li>
</ul>And we're not just asking for donations: we have something 
special to offer each and every contributor. We want to get people as 
involved as we can in the process. Attention to detail is what we're going for. Our flyers will look like menus &amp; we have a sketch artist drawing up anime inspired art for our T-Shirt &amp; sticker designs. We will be updating you all with the final look of these products. <p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/887670/files/20140928075614-Image_9-24-14_at_5.32_PM.jpg?1411916174"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                                  <i>(Design #1)</i><br/>                                                      Art by Leilani Rodriguez<br/>

<p>This is going to be a themed project that will represent what 
we do in a small way. Brainchild makes solo beat albums and all beats no more than 2 minutes each. To play into what he does as an 
artist &amp; also showcase the emcee element we decided to put out a 7 
song project where all songs are named after apps, 
&amp; foods we like to munch on. As well, all songs will be two and a half minutes or less. Once the project is done we will host a listening party  for our contributors and supporters showcasing the project. We will be serving all of the food on our track list (menu).  <i>We want to show you the potential of what we are cooking!</i>

Individually our backgrounds are different, but we come together in building creatively for hip hop. Just 2 out of the box thinkers overcoming doubt & taking action!
 We met 3 years ago through a mutual friend, & since have build a 
friendship that led to multiple jam sessions, shows & opportunities 
together within the Orlando scene. As individual artist Our styles don't fit any particular mold & we want to share that with as many people as we can. For the past 10 years we have been practicing, performing anywhere from living rooms, churches, coffee shops, festivals & clubs. Though we have separately seen slight notoriety from sites such as Rapzilla, GrindTime Now, & Vice.com we know this is only the first step towards a long journey. That reality is what makes this the process a little scary, but that's ok. We represent the generalities that are true in all of us, the fears, the visions, People with a past & a present. We want to share our perspective the only way we know how.

What We Need & What You Get


We have managed to finance our studio time with top notch producers, so you're promised a quality sound (thank GOD). Your role is so important because you're helping us materialize it!
The funds will be used exclusively to distribute
 and promote the EP And the more money we raise, the more YOU get. 
To be more specific, here is how the funds will be used:

Cover Art, Logo and Manufacturing of the EP: 

Promotion (Listening Party, Flyers etc) 

Merchandise (T-Shirts, stickers, buttons etc)

And we're not just asking for donations: we have something 
special to offer each and every contributor. We want to get people as 
involved as we can in the process. Attention to detail is what we're going for. Our flyers will look like menus & we have a sketch artist drawing up anime inspired art for our T-Shirt & sticker designs. We will be updating you all with the final look of these products.                                                                    (Design #1)                                                      Art by Leilani Rodriguez
  
Appetizers..

This is going to be a themed project that will represent what 
we do in a small way. Brainchild makes solo beat albums and all beats no more than 2 minutes each. To play into what he does as an 
artist & also showcase the emcee element we decided to put out a 7 
song project where all songs are named after apps, 
& foods we like to munch on. As well, all songs will be two and a half minutes or less. Once the project is done we will host a listening party  for our contributors and supporters showcasing the project. We will be serving all of the food on our track list (menu).  We want to show you the potential of what we are cooking!

TRACK LIST

<p><b>It's hard to express how much this project would change our lives.</b></p>
<p>When our band first formed a few years ago, we never dreamt that we would be in this position. This whole experience has been so surreal and we're wicked thankful for all the support. We originally just formed this band to get away from all the stresses of being a young adult and trying to figure our lives out. But Squints quickly grew into something bigger after we released our first songs to the public. The feedback was unreal and it inspired us to take our music to the next level. When Plaid Dog Recording reached out to us we knew it was the perfect opportunity to do that. </p>
<p>Music has always always been a huge part of our lives. We all had bands throughout high school and even played a few shows here and there. All of our friends and family have been supporting us since the very beginning and have helped us reach this point. Our lyrics are inspired by the suburbs we've grown up in and all of the experiences that came with it. We hope our music connects back to our hometowns and that people can really relate to it. We also want our story to inspire younger artists to keep pursuing their music. </p>
<p>We've never made a professional music project like this before, so we're eager to get back in the studio. In the mean time, we'll continue writing, practicing, and perfecting our sound to give you guys some great music to listen to. With your support, we can make all of this happen and record our first professional album.</p>

Art activities are dwindling and suffering from lack of funds
particularly in our urban areas. There are very few programs, if any for
children and families. This year in 2014 , The Firey Strings Company (FSCO) has been invited
to partner with the Manna House Workshop in East Harlem. FSCO is proposing to
raise money for the Manna House summer Workshop and for our Radiance 2
Festival.
 
The Radiance Festival FSCO  produces a yearly event called
the Radiance
Festival . The festival started as a culminating activity from
summer composer’s workshops. It has organically transformed into a fantastic
way to bring artist together with the community. Our first annual Radiance Festival in 2013 featured
composers Jay Rodriguez, Geraldine Eguiluz thanks to the Canadian
Council of the Arts,  Hamiet Bluiett/Frank Lacey and a 10 piece Firey
String Sistas! Ensemble. The festival was held at the beautiful Shape
Shifter’s Lab, Brooklyn. 
  
Our GoalOn March 2, 2014, our second annual Radiance 2 Festival, will feature world
class artists trumpeter, composer Cecil Brigewater and cellist,
composer Akua Dixon (Yamaha Artist). Their music will be performed by an exciting ten
piece Firey String Sistas! ensemble- Violins; Frederika Krier,
Ariadna Kryazheva, Megan Atchley, Jennifer Axelson, Violas: Charisa
Dowe-Rouse, Pamela Hamilton, Cellos: Nioka Workman, Nicole Verderosa, Bass: Melissa
Slocum
and Harp: Riza Printup.

<h3>My name is Pete Cater and I play drums.</h3>
<p>Having first picked up a pair of sticks in very early childhood I have now been playing for more than fifty years.</p>
<p>Born into a musical family I was fortunate to have great influences and access to inspiration from my first days. Such was the power of this inspiration that I made it my goal very early on to aim as high as possible, seeking a level of attainment akin to that of the legendary drummers in my father's record collection. </p>
<p>Not blessed with a formal music education or an entree into the upper echelons of the music industry it was very much left up to me to make my own way when it came time to become a professional player. This I have done and I believe that you can do it too. </p>
<p>I first began performing at a professional level in 1977, took my first private students in 1982 and have been teaching at university/college level since 1994.</p>
<p>My career as a performing musician has always and continues to encompass a broad range of musical genres, however it is as a jazz musician, with particular emphasis on big band playing that I have forged an international reputation. In 2015 I was voted in the world's top 5 jazz drummers by Rhythm magazine, the only non-USA player to be nominated in that year's poll.</p>
<p>I am proud to be affiliated with Premier drums, for whom I appear as international brand ambassador, the Avedis Zildjian company, and Vater drumsticks.</p>
<p>My lifelong quest for attainment in my field, having been inspired in very early childhood by legends like Joe Morello, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson has led me to scrutinise the techniques of drumming very closely. I have spent much of the last three decades analysing and deconstructing the approaches of all manner of drummers across the entire musical spectrum.</p>
<p>However, not content merely to replicate what has gone before I have fused the traditions of the past masters with contemporary concepts and developments both with regard to technical facility, musical application, and with particular emphasis on creativity and improvisation. </p>
<p>Decades of research and development have led me to a point where I feel I have a logical, easily understood  and fully formed approach to the instrument, and that I have the tools to simplify and revolutionise drumming for players of all ability levels.</p>
<p>My work as an educator in music colleges, masterclasses, clinics, drum camps and with private students has proved that a great many students feel overwhelmed by the amount of information available and the required level of knowledge. My approach simplifies and strips away unnecessary baggage and will help the student understand how everything comes back to a very small number of key parameters that are at the root of everything all drummers do. </p>
<p>Now it is time to share this with the world. My never-ending quest for self-improvement means that I'll never run out of things to work on, and you can have this too. I have seen the dramatic effects of my methods on private students on numerous occasions and it is my aim to achieve a global reach that would be impossible for me as a single individual.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I'm aiming to make this DVD as informative as possible. Production values will be at the highest possible level but the intention is to make the end product long on substance without being fixated on style and image. There is no contingency for 'photo shoots' in this campaign for instance.</p>
<p>In order to take raw footage and edit it into a coherent sequence of between 2 and 4 hours duration, together with manufacturing costs, DVD artwork, plus all contingencies and sundry expenses, the target has been set at 5000 GBP.</p>
<p>In the event that the target is significantly surpassed, the scope of the production will be expanded to feature performance examples with musician colleagues from my three bands; The Pete Cater Big Band, The Ministry of Jazz, and The Organisation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Global Reach</h3>
<p>The videos on this page include two parts of a series of four produced in 2015 in association with Rhythm magazine. These videos prompted a huge response, requests for private lessons and clinic/masterclass appearances, as well as all sorts of questions about all manner of drum concepts relating to both hand technique and musical applications. All these questions I will endeavour to answer in the dvd. These videos are shared here in order to give an insight into the style of presentation and method of delivery. </p>
<p>The aim is to make every drummer play better; to demistify and simplify much of what we do. With so much material available these days, be it audio visual or good old fashioned printed words it can be easy for aspiring players to feel overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge that is seemingly a prerequisite of the contemporary drummer. Stand by to see a few myths get busted!</p>
<p>Through Indiegogo's InDemand feature plans are also in place for further projects including a 'big band minus drums' package featuring some legendary and challenging music as well as recording, performance and educational projects featuring The Pete Cater Big Band, The Ministry of Jazz and The Organisation.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Thank you</strong></h2>
<p>Every contribution counts and helps. Whatever you feel able to pledge all makes a difference. Also I won't be annoying you with unsolicited and needy emails, private messages or texts. I look forward to making this happen with your help. Thanks.</p>

<p>Welcome to October Rage's Indie Go Go campaign page! In case you're not yet aware, we are a rock band from Australia currently on tour in the United States. We've had multiple releases, including a full length album and our latest single, White Walkers, and have shared the stage with some of the biggest bands in the world, including Bon Jovi, Sevendust, Steel Panther and Saliva. <br/><br/>Indie Go Go is a fundraising platform where artists can raise funds for tours, albums, etc... and fans can contribute by getting what is called ""perks"" e.g rewards for supporting their favorite artists. <br/><br/>October Rage's campaign is dedicated to raising enough funds to keep our tour going so we can reach every corner of the world where you, the fans, want to see us play. By contributing to October Rage's cause, you can become a HUGE part of our history and join us on our journey!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Will Corbin, I am a musician in Bangkok, Thailand.  I have been performing for a few years now, and was named the Ukulele Champion of Thailand 2011 with my musical colleague, Kitti Bronco.  I, along with a handful of talented musicians and artists who are taking part, am in the process of producing a music project entitled ""Au Contraire.""</p>
<p>Au Contraire is a multi-genre project, but mostly tends to center on elements of Folk and Jazz.  This is a project I am taking on with Pacifico music with producer Paul Romaine, who is a musical genius and very dedicated to his craft.</p>
<p>Au Contraire is a chance for myself and the musicians taking part to be heard, and to create something meaningful and timeless.  I also have two photographers and an animator who will be creating related artistic work to accompany the music, so this is also a chance for their art to be represented.</p>
<p>We have the musicians, the songs, the direction, and we have the heart - all we are missing is the funding! With your help, we can have the chance to shine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have set our goal at 2,500 USD.  This encompasses the costs of producing the songs in the studio, commissioning of the various artists involved (an artist should receive compensation for their time and effort) and cutting the album.</p>
<p>Every donation counts, and we will recognize you and give you credit on our album and on our videos! No matter what amount you decide to give we will be one step closer to completing our work.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We founded New Millennium Orchestra in 2005 because we are incredibly passionate about sharing the power of classical music through innovative programming…and happened to have an orchestra's worth of amazingly talented friends. Watch the video above to learn more about our story, and to hear the results of all of our hard work. Each year we've grown in our ability to present programs on our own initiative. This year we've chosen to produce Der Kaiser Von Atlantis because we believe that audiences will be moved and inspired by hearing a rarely performed opera written under the most extreme circumstances. Kaiser will be shown in workshop March 8-10 on the City of Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events' series ""In The Works"", a series that takes place behind the closed glass doors of the incredible stage of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion at Chicago's Millennium Park.</p>
<p>Viktor Ullmann's opera was written in 1943 at the concentration camp Theresienstadt (Terezín) using a libretto by Peter Kien. A hopeful parable influenced by Weill, Mahler, and Berg, the chamber opera was rehearsed but never performed; the Nazis saw the Kaiser as a Hitler satire, and both Ullmann and Kien were sent to certain doom at Auschwitz. At Theresienstadt, Ullman wrote, ""we simply did not sit and lament...that our will for culture was not sufficient to our will to exist...all who have worked in life and art to wrestle content into its unyielding form will say that I was right...""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>George Bernard Shaw said that opera was ‘the most expensive invention of man, second only to war.’ Putting on an opera without fundraising staff, or a large endowment, would be impossible for most-- for us, it's the next logical step. These three performances will be directed by Joanie Schultz and conducted by Francesco Milioto-- the last time we all collaborated, we received rave reviews like: <br/><br/> ""Kudos to director Joanie Schultz for an inspired under-the-dome staging that manages to be gently satiric without entirely sacrificing the deeper emotions. Add a superb cast of fine young voices and idiomatic musical backing from conductor Francesco Milioto and the New Millennium Orchestra and it all adds up to a witty, delightful retooling of Acis and Galatea."" -Lawrence A. Johnson, Chicago Classical Review</p>
<p>We have some great perks to thank you for your donation. Each person who donates will be named in the Kaiser program. We have VIP tickets to the show. We have an exclusive afterwork cocktail party with the Kaiser cast, conductor, and director in March where you can meet the artists while enjoying wine and hors d'oevres. We are offering two different private concert options showcasing our talented conductor and orchestra members. And finally we're offering our largest donor the chance to make a night of it at the Radisson Blu Aqua as our guest after the show.</p>
<p>Our ensemble spends over ninety percent of our annual budget on our artists, and we make only 5% of our yearly budget from ticket sales (it used to be mostly for-hire before regional presenter's budgets shrank drastically) which means we have to make up the rest with grants and donations. We choose to keep our ticket prices low because we want our performances to be affordable to most people-- in fact, for this, and many of our past productions, tickets are free to the public.</p>
<p>We're trying to achieve $20,000 in donations from this campaign. If we reach this goal, not only will this production occur, but making a recording and planning an entire 2013/14 season will become feasible. Over 700 people will be reached by this appearance, adding to the thousands of citizens we've reached over the last eight years. If we don't make our goal, we won't be able to continue to expand this impact even further, and continue to rise on our trajectory that has recently included performances at Orchestra Hall and the Harris Theater.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support not only helps the New Millennium Orchestra put on this show, it means that our ensemble will be able to plan, make, and document future shows. This is how we will progress down the road-map to sustainability and avoid the catch-22 of nascent arts organizations. Previous productions in partnership with the Chicago Cultural Center garnered critical acclaim in both the Chicago Classical Review, Chicago Sun Times, and the Chicago Tribune. This project, along with our future work, will be fantastic. </p>

<p>Purpose of the Tours</p>
<p>The purpose of the GadenShartse tour is to share with all people the Tibetan culture, as well as practices and paths to inner peace and compassion.  Accomplishments of previous tours have provided funds for construction of new buildings at Gaden Shartse, including the new debate hall.</p>
<p><br/>Additional funds raised by past tours have supported medical needs, teachers’ salaries and the day to day expenses of supporting the monastery. This success is due to the help and generosity of those who support the tours.</p>
<p><br/>The monks of Gaden Shartse feel deeply indebted to their friends in the West who have given their time, effort, and homes to make the tours possible. It is hoped that the upcoming tour will be a success.</p>
<p>Funds raised from the tours will also help finance the new guest house which has been constructed with the purpose of making guests and visitors from the west more comfortable. The guest house offers western amenities such as private rooms and bathrooms and western meals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Shartse” Today</p>
<p>In-depth education in all aspects of Buddhist philosophy and practice is the focal point of the academic program at Shartse. The duration of the monastic program is 24 years. The students interact with their teachers on a daily basis. Accommodation, food, and instruction are all free and are provided by the monastic administration. Shartse offers complete basic courses in Tibetan History, Literature, Poetry, Grammar, English, and Mathematics, which are studied as prerequisites for the more advanced courses of Elementary Dialectics, Buddhist Logic, the Prajnaparamita (the study of Wisdom/ the Heart Sutra), Madhyamika Philosophy, Vinaya (Ethics), and Abidharma (Epistemology). All sand mandala takes 4-6 days to complete. Under certain circumstances a shorter version may be offered.</p>
<p>Unique to Shartse is the compulsory study of Buddhist Tantra. Additionally, there are optional subjects such as Painting, Calligraphy, Tailoring, Tibetan Butter Sculpture formation, and Sand mandala creation. The training program also encourages its students to independently pursue and practice profound Buddhist rituals and to complete extensive solitary retreats.</p>
<p>The Monastery hosts multiple festivals, seminars and inter-monastic philosophical meetings. The Monastery also encourages active fieldwork. All members sixteen and older are given fieldwork assignments for four months of every year, during which time they are required to contribute to the day-to-day running of the monastery. Such co-operative jobs include secretarial office work, cooking, milking the cows, clinic management, and general maintenance. The Monastery also hires some of the local Indian residents to assist with construction and farm work, thus contributing financially to the local economy.</p>
<p>Shartse has a staff of twenty, sixteen of whom are teachers and four of whom oversee the proper administration of the programs. Aside from the two English language and mathematics teachers who are recruited from outside the monastery, every member of the staff has graduated from the Monastery.</p>
<p>They teach an average of seven hours a day and offer private instruction from their own living quarters.  For more than twenty years they have provided this service free of charge. Only recently did the New Educational Development Project begin to offer them a token remuneration of the equivalent of US $4.00 each month.</p>
<p>Teachers play a very special role in the lives of their students. As is the Tibetan tradition, and also due to the early age at which many youths leave their families to join the Monastery, students admire and respect their teachers as they would their parents.  Teachers are considered to be the source of both the academic and the spiritual development of their students.</p>
<p>Following the democratic constitution promulgated by His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 1964, all Tibetan institutions now function as parts of a democratic government. Although privately administered, the College is also administered on an election basis.  There are eight board members who are elected as directors every three years. The President of the College, however, is appointed directly by the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, as was done in pre-invasion Tibet.</p>
<p>A world tour by members of Shartse in 1988 enabled the administration to begin the new Education Development Project. This interagency body now monitors all educational development and makes suggestions regarding the necessity of improvements and modernization.  Additionally, a few senior students are elected to oversee a library at the Monastery that is open to both students and non-students.</p>
<p>With a modest collection of important Tibetan works and Western works of philosophy, the library is accessible, free of charge. In order to feed, house, clothe, and provide study materials for each monk, it costs just over US$1 per day per monk. For 1600 monks, this amounts to close to US$1700 per day, or approximately US$600,000 per year. This expense is for the most basic necessities and does not cover the costs of building maintenance, construction, farming, or improvements.</p>
<p>Maintenance is the most costly aspect of running Gaden Shartse Monastic College. The original 84 acres of farmland that was allocated to the monks in 1969 was done so as a lease, and this land provides the bulk of the Monastery's income.  </p>
<p>The main source of income for the Monastery comes from the sale of rice grown on the leased farmland. Even in the most profitable year, the yearly revenue from the crops can only cover one month of the expenses of the Monastery. With this acute shortfall in cash, short-term loans are arranged from time to time. Unlike other active educational centers of its size in India, Shartse does not receive any government funding from India or abroad.  Thus the need to meet the financial obligations of the Monastery is urgent. There are very limited and unreliable sources of income, and the majority of revenue comes from tours abroad.</p></div>","Short Summary

Maintenance is the most costly aspect of running Gaden Shartse Monastic College. The original 84 acres of farmland that was allocated to the monks in 1969 was done so as a lease, and this land provides the bulk of the Monastery's income.  
The main source of income for the Monastery comes from the sale of rice grown on the leased farmland. Even in the most profitable year, the yearly revenue from the crops can only cover one month of the expenses of the Monastery. With this acute shortfall in cash, short-term loans are arranged from time to time. Unlike other active educational centers of its size in India, Shartse does not receive any government funding from India or abroad.  Thus the need to meet the financial obligations of the Monastery is urgent. There are very limited and unreliable sources of income, and the majority of revenue comes from tours abroad.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
