<p>FRSH (For
Sharing Hope) is a “socialprise” (for-profit/social-enterprise) that creates
the highest-quality handcrafted organic soap products. Our social mission is to
reduce the number of families around the world without access to basic
sanitation. For every organic bar of soap you buy, FRSH will give a standard bar
of soap to a child or family in need. FRSH partners with
the Hope Sharing Foundation, a 501 (c) non-profit organization, to fulfill its
soap giving and sustainability projects.</p>

</div></div>","FRSH (For
Sharing Hope) is a “socialprise” (for-profit/social-enterprise) that creates
the highest-quality handcrafted organic soap products. Our social mission is to
reduce the number of families around the world without access to basic
sanitation. For every organic bar of soap you buy, FRSH will give a standard bar
of soap to a child or family in need. FRSH partners with
the Hope Sharing Foundation, a 501 (c) non-profit organization, to fulfill its
soap giving and sustainability projects.








The
Internet has put us in a unique and equal position to make a lasting
difference on this planet and in people's lives. Together, we
can succeed in bringing basic sanitation to many underserved communities.
Every time you use one of our soaps, you are instilling hope to those in need.










Some of us
take cleanliness for granted, but imagine living without soap. This sobering
reality affects 2.6 billion people across the globe. For children, hygiene and sanitation-related illnesses, such as
diarrhea, cholera, and pneumonia, are the #1 killer. Each year, two million children will not live to celebrate their 5th birthday. Overall,
these types of illnesses are the #4 killer among all age groups.





Providing
soap is among the most effective ways to combat against preventable illnesses. According
to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""hand washing could save more
lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention.""







At FRSH we believe access to soap is a human right. As stated in the the U.N. Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (Article 25): ""Everyone has the right to a standard of living
adequate for the health and well-being of himself and his family.""






With the FRSH
pledge, we match every bar of organic soap purchased with a standard bar of soap
given to a child in need. To make the greatest impact, we partner
with suppliers in Africa to afford large quantities of standard bars of soap to
local villages and towns.















We believe
that feeling good on the outside is as important as feeling good on the inside
when using FRSH. We provide our supporters with premium
handcrafted organic bar soaps using only the freshest certified-natural
ingredients.







Experience
the FRSH difference. Our organic soap bars are perfect
for your body, face, and hair. FRSH soaps are a safe and hygienic choice
for babies and children. 












Say goodbye to sloppy, mushy soap! Have your soap dry perfectly every time and ready to use on your next wash. Our magnetic holder will reduce waste left in soap dishes by up to 30%. The holder is attachable to any sink or shower wall.  







Our soaps are made with ONLY the highest-quality ingredients and include:




We do NOT use any of the following materials in our soaps:














We strive to have the most positive impact on the environment. Our plantable eco-friendly soap box is handcrafted from double-recycled paper, printed with soy ink, and embedded with wildflower seeds. Plant our box, add water, and watch beautiful flowers bloom!





Due to the urgency of the Ebola crisis, FRSH is focusing its giving mission to aid children and families in high-risk West African countries. With your support, FRSH will be able to significantly expand its mission to more locations around the world.

We are partnering with the Nicaragua Community Health Connection and the people of Los Robles, a coffee community in northern Nicaragua, to support the community's first and only health clinic. We would love to have you join us in our effort to provide much needed medical care for this beautiful community.The NCHC: The Nicaragua Community Health Connection (NCHC) is an organization devoted to bettering communities all over Nicaragua. By countering poverty and isolation, investing in social capital, and stimulating local leadership, the NCHC is improving the lives of thousands of people. NCHC serves to connect the people of Los Robles with the valuable resources and networks that NCHC Advocates and other supporters can provide (like yourself!). We are proud to call them a partner in our mission. For more information about the NCHC: http://www.nicachc.org/Why?: We should all do what we can to help those in need. Nicaragua is the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with 42% of the population living in extreme poverty. Unable to afford the proper healthcare, many Nicaraguan people are suffering from very preventable and treatable diseases and injuries. We are going to change that. Through the power of networks and community, we plan to connect the Los Robles clinic with you in order to significantly improve the lives of this community.The Campaign
The Team: We are a group of 6 students studying Social Enterprise at Emory University's Goizueta Business School. Throughout the course, we study the hardships a small community like Los Robles endures. When we learned about the immediate need for proper medical care, we knew we had to help. With your generous donations, we will become successful in our current mission. Ultimately, we hope our success will inspire other students at Emory University to participate and support the Social Enterprise @ Goizueta movement. Together, we can make a difference.

<p class=""""> </p>
<p></p></div>","Story

Baby E, came as a blessing after 4 miscarriages. After a complicated pregnancy, she was induced at 34 weeks for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). E spent her first 3 weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). She had 2 small ventricular septal defects (VSD) and a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) significant in size. The PDA, which is an open fetal blood vessel that should’ve closed after birth, affects the ability to feed and breathe resulting in poor growth. 

When 5 weeks later, it still had not closed, E, only a mere 4 lbs was re-hospitalized in the NICU for intravenous Indocin, a medication that can close the ductus. The treatment was unsuccessful despite everyone's high hopes. Two weeks later, her parents knew something was wrong when she stopped feeding and experienced greater difficulty breathing. They took her to the Emergency Room. She was again admitted, this time for acute congestive heart failure (CHF) and failure to thrive (FTT), and subsequently required nasal gastric (NG) tube feeding for nearly 2 weeks.
On January 11, 2013, at 3 and half months old, a team of UCSF cardiologists attempted to close E’s PDA via cardiac catherization. This procedure was unsuccessful, and her doctors intended to attempt another catherization when she reached a hearty 11 pounds. During her stay at UCSF, E caught a virus from her little roommate. After being home for 1 week, she was taken to the ER, where she tested positive for pneumonia and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) resulting in hospitalization.

Unfortunately, E fell off the chart as her growth significantly slowed down. Now at 5 months, she weighs 8.5 lbs and due to her failure to thrive she needed urgent heart surgery to close the PDA. E is currently recovering in ICU at UCSF from her March 2, 2013 operation.
In addition to her cardiac condition E has proctocollitis, a formula allergy that causes lower intestinal bleeding. Her mom was able to provide breast milk for 4 months but has since stopped producing. Frustratingly, E's insurance denied coverage for the cost of her prescription to the milk bank, which is nearly $2000 each month. Fortunately, E is receiving breast milk from caring moms through casual milk sharing, and the Mother's Milk Bank is generously donating screened and pastuerized milk through March. However future donations are indeterminate at this time. 
In all, E has spent 9-plus weeks in the hospital and has had to face many obstacles and hurdles. Despite what she has been through at such a tender age, she is a miraculous fighter. And her parents, family, and friends hope her days of being in and out of the hospital are over. 

 


What We Need  
E's  mom and dad never in a million years imagined that they would become parents of a premature baby, who would consequently need a lot of medical care. Her parents are eternally grateful for your generosity and kindness.

<p>Quinns mother, Rosemary, and I have known each other ALL of our lives. Her mother and mine were expecting at the same time. Although we are not ""sisters"" by blood, we are sisters by love. There is nothing that we wouldn't do for one another. I can't physically be with Rosemary right now, but I know there are other needs that I can help with. That is why I am setting up this fundraiser. </p>
<p>Help.quinnnow is a fundraiser for my dearest friend, Rosemary's 21 year old son that was in a terrible explosion/accident on October 18, 2012 that required him to be transported by Medevac to a city 3 hours away. He was helping a friend on the side of a road that had run out of gas; the gas can ignited and he tried to kick it away from the vehicle and away from a main and busy road to keep others from being hurt. In doing this, his body became engulfed in flames. He received 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 50% of his body and will require many surgeries, an extensive hospital stay, rehabilitation and physical therapy. His family is at his side but both parents work full time and must travel 3 hours each way to be with their son. There will be additional medical expenses that insurance will not cover as well as traveling to/from the hospital and lost wages by both parents.</p>
<p>Quinn is an exceptional young man, and has made great strides in working and taking care of his young children. One of his thoughts was ""my wallet burned... I had my child support money in there""... He put his children first, even in the condition that he is in! His road to recovery will be a very long, painful and tiresome one. His hands, arms, back and legs/ankles have been burned badly. He underwent the first of many surgeries this morning and it was determined that he has some nerve damage and they will have to go back to that area and perform more surgery.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are setting a goal of $50,000.00 to cover upcoming medical bills as well as any lost wages for both Danny and Rosemary (Quinn's parents). They are on a very fixed income and will not allow them to have enough money for their monthly living expenses or to cover traveling expenses to be with their son.</li>
<li>The goal of $50,000.00  may seem out of reach, but we are hopeful that your kindness and generosity will cause you to help Quinn on his road to recovery.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a parent myself, I cannot imagine the pain and turmoil they are faced with each day, knowing that there is little they can do for Quinn. They have to let go and trust that he will be cared for by medical staff, extended family and friends. I can't imagine having to leave my son in a hospital to drive 3 hours away to work. I would wnat to be with my son, to help him through each day, to hold him when the pain is unbearable, to love him on the days that he needs it most, to let him feel the touch of my hand caressing his cheek, or wiping a tear.</p>
<p>Danny and Rosemary are incredible people, that have always worked hard to provide a good home for their family. They are two people that will do anything to help someone out. I hope that we can come together and give them some help that they desperately need through this situation.</p>
<p>We are praying, hoping and believing that Quinn will make an incredible recovery and will be able to share his story of a incredible family, friends and concerned people coming together to help him when he needed it most.</p>

<h3>THE DELPHIN (Patents Pending)</h3>
<p>Just as the Delphin served as the greatest wingman of all time for the god of the sea, today's Delphin serves as the greatest workout companion of all time for runners tired of carrying around their phone and every swimmer tired of the lap swimming grind. With the Delphin, you can finally use your favorite apps in the pool. As a wearable touch-screen device with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, the Delphin operates underwater and on land without a phone. It features access to apps, external buttons for navigating playlists and volume, and a unique design tailored for maximum portability. This wearable makes your swimming workout a joy.</p>
<p><strong>Uses the same apps:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Download your content wirelessly:</strong></p>
<p>Wirelessly download content by simply connecting to the WiFi hotspot at home, work, or your pool. Use the same playlists you already created on Spotify or the stations you created on Pandora.

<p><strong>Compatible with wired or Bluetooth headphones:</strong></p>
<p>With each pre-order of the Delphin, we’ll send you your choice of waterproof headphones to go with it.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Swimbuds Sport Waterproof Headphones</strong> have an advanced design for the best possible sound underwater. Multiple sizes and styles of earbud tips are guaranteed to help you find a good seal for any ear.</li>
<li>
<strong>Swimbuds Bluetooth Waterproof Headphones</strong> are the first waterproof bluetooth headphones designed for use when actually submerged. Water distorts bluetooth signals too much for headphones to work when separated from the source of the signal. The Delphin solves that by being 100% waterproof and small enough to clip on your goggle strap. Both headphones work great above water as well!</li>

<h3>Who should use the Delphin?</h3>
<p>The Delphin provides a much cleaner experience for swimmers and runners. With way more storage and the ability to connect to WiFi wherever you work out, the Delphin offers much more convenience and functionality than a phone.</p>
<p>Swimmers and other athletes will appreciate the Delphin for acting as a tool to improve performance, endurance and speed. You can use it to stay energized and maintain focus when the pressure is on and you need to take the edge off.</p>

<h3><strong>Why do I need the Delphin?</strong></h3>
<p>If you already exercise, you probably listen to music while you run or hear the upbeat playlists blasting at your local gym. This music helps with more than just having fun or ambiance. Getting “pumped up” has real effects on the human brain.</p>
<p>Music helps us disassociate. When you listen to music while you exercise, disassociation helps you become less aware of the pain and the fatigue that your body experiences, enabling you to go that extra set. With swimming specifically, music can also help you synchronize your movements. When that happens, you actually use your oxygen more efficiently and give yourself a better workout.</p>
<p>Ultimately, music can play a key role in your results whether you exercise to recover from an injury or you train to compete in an upcoming race. The Delphin enables you to easily access all of your favorite music on a device that will not get in the way of your swim.</p>
<h3>Underwater Audio History</h3>
<p>Underwater Audio started five and a half years ago out of a true need for a solution. Todd hurt his back in a car accident and began swimming for physical therapy. With 25 years of experience as an engineer, he decided that there should be a better way to listen to music while you swim. He then asked his son, Scott, a marketing major at the time, to help him with his idea to start a company. They spent the last six years testing various methods to bring music underwater and make it just as easy as listening to music on your phone. After some probably not-so-safe experiments involving transmitters and water, they’ve come to the conclusion that radio waves and water don’t mix. Scott and Todd ultimately solved the problem of streaming music underwater by avoiding the issue altogether. The Delphin enables swimmers to download their music onto the device for offline listening and swim with music to their heart’s content.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491414873/voa2ndhhvttmajhxqb8t.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Underwater Audio has already built a working prototype of the Delphin and has begun preparing for production. We expect the Indiegogo campaign will help us better understand the demand for the Delphin and pay for production tooling.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge we foresee is the ability to meet the quickly growing demand for the Delphin in an organized and timely manner.</p>

She endures extreme pain and serious bacterial infections cause by the lack of Lymph nodes in her right arm.They were removed because cancer had spread. She has had 18 infections in the last 5 years and 5 just since September 2013. These Manual Lymphatic Massages are crucial for her to have a better quality of life. These infections are bacterial in nature and if allowed to spread would be catastrophic to her life.She is unable to pay for the Lymphatic drainage massages. There is NO provincial coverage for what she needs. The massages range between $85-$100  a session plus the cost of bandages. Not to mention the numerous medications she is taking to alleviate the pain and antibiotics to fend off a more serious infection. She desperately needs to be able to function normally and not be in pain ......she was diagnosed at 31. Thank you everyone in advance.Please everyone read the following: It is directly from my sister Carol......truly heartbreaking what she has had to go throughI have had 18 bouts with cellulits since 2008. 5 since sept 2013. I require ER immediately in order to have IV antibiotics for 3-5 days. The bacteria spreads very fast and creates swelling, redness, heat and extreme pain with fever and chills. I often require morphine or pain killers. I also need a epinephrine pen..epi pen as I get an anaphylactic allergic reaction to 2 of the antibiotics.  The NS provincial health care does not cover MLD, manual lymphatic drainage at all. Sunlife insurance and most best health plan do not either as it falls under massages. However the province will pay for my over 100 visits to the ER and or home care from Nurses to administer my meds. This makes no sense to me. I lose work and money and worst of all my quality of life has been greatly affected by this little known or understood side affect of breast cancer and the removal of lymph nodes followed by radiation. My immune system and my lymphatic system has been greatly compromised.  
I appreciate your help Val. I need to have this fluid moved out of my arm as the bacteria just love this stagnant environment. 
Hope this helps

<p>Our rates of chronic disease are epidemic. More than 70 million have prediabetes and that number will grow to 100 million by 2020. In addition, 80 million have heart disease, and whether we know it or not, someone we love is at risk for a heart attack or stroke. </p>
<p>What prediabetes and heart disease have in common is their cause: both are food-borne diseases. We are getting sicker by the day and there's one simple reason: we are treating the wrong thing. Instead of focusing on what people eat, our healthcare system puts people on more and more medications to counter the effects of poor diet.</p>
<p><em><b>At Truhealth MD, we imagine a world where physicians prescribe food<br/>as often as they prescribe medications.</b></em></p>

<p>At Truhealth MD, we have already developed a system of <b>condition-specific<br/>therapeutic foods</b> to help people manage heart disease and heart disease risk factors. Now we’re developing a line of foods to help people with prediabetes halt their progression to type 2 diabetes.  There are no specific food solutions for prediabetes currently, yet every prediabetic will become a diabetic (with all the devastating complications) unless they make very specific dietary changes. </p>
<p>Our pioneering foods are formulated from whole, plant-based ingredients using a unique portfolio approach to deliver therapeutic levels of fiber, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and phytosterols. They are <b>scientifically based</b>, with more than 300 clinical trials documenting the health benefits of the ingredients.</p>

<p>Our Step One system is designed to meet published best-practice medical care<br/>guidelines that specify nutrition intervention as the first step in chronic disease care. And our entire approach is about great taste and maximum convenience. We spent years developing our foods and our eating system, and there is simply no other resource like this on the market. </p>
<p>And guess what?  It works!  We have already seen dramatic results with the heart line among many individuals with high cholesterol. Some people have avoided cholesterol-lowering medications (""statins""), some have lowered their medication doses, some lost weight, and almost everyone felt better. And typically people saw results <strong>after only 30 days</strong> of using our products.</p>
<p>BUT... anecdotal evidence is not enough to convince the broad medical community to change the way it practices. Only empirical, independent scientific data will do the trick. That's why we need to confirm our preliminary results through a formal independent clinical trial. (Please scroll down to learn more about the trial itself.)</p>
<p>Now, you would think that there would already be thousands of published trials evaluating food interventions in treating disease.  Turns out, there are hardly any.  There’s lots of data about individual ingredients and multiple population surveys that look at average eating patterns, but almost no studies that evaluate a food-based intervention in treating or preventing disease. </p>
<p>We eat 3 times per day, yet we know almost nothing about the health effects<br/>of this fundamental activity. </p>
<h4>
<br/>THE IMPACT</h4>
<p>Our goal is not just to prove that our products work, but to shine a spotlight on a huge opportunity to change healthcare. We really are on a mission – a goal far and beyond Truhealth MD. We want doctors to prescribe food as often as they do medications. We want the healthcare community to treat the cause -- not just the symptoms -- of disease. And, together, we can lead the way!<span>  </span></p>

DON'T STOP GIVING! THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE!Our total project goal is $10,000 that we need to raise before spring of 2015 to be ready by summer 2015.""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot...""This is something new and big for our little camp! It's a big leap of faith, but we are passionate and ready for the challenge. Mostly, we know that camp has a beautiful community of people who love and support our work. So many people have been affected by camp. So many people love the work that is happening here. People like you!We know you are out there and we need your help! If this camp, or ANY camp has impacted your life and you have ever wondered how you can still be involved, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE! Help be a part of this new and exciting project! Without the donations of individuals this project won't go anywhere. No donation is too large or too small!Remember what our friend the Lorax says: ""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing's going to get better- its not.""Why we are so excited about tree climbing! Camp Cherith of Western New York's mission is to transform lives, cultivate disciples, and train leaders through a Bible-based, Christ-centered outdoor camping program for children and youth. We've been instilling a love for God's creation in the minds and hearts of young people for over 65 years. We are looking forward to expanding our program to include Adventure Education Tree Climbing because it perfectly fits with our mission and vision for camp. Here are a few of our favorite reasons for pursing tree climbing: 
Tree climbing is a way to get up close and personal with one of our favorite parts of God's creation. Tree climbing is a great self-confidence booster and helps campers overcome fears. Tree climbing provides lots of different levels of fun for campers of any age and skill level.
Tree climbing is a unique and memorable experience.
Tree climbing is incredibly fun! (Trust us- we've tried it out!)
  Our big huge goal. We have done our research. We realize this is a big step. We are talking to all the people we need to talk to. We want this to happen.We want this program to be fully operational by Summer 2015.$10,000 will help us accomplish all the steps necessary to make this happen. The training of our lead facilitators, the prepping of the trees we are gonna be using, the gear (harnesses, ropes, carabiners, helmets, and safety gear), insurance costs, and all the other details that needs to come together.

<h3>Keratoconus</h3>
<p>I've had a progressive eye disease called Keratoconus for going on 3 years now. After a series of injuries including two corneal abrasions, and recurrent corneal erosions causing infection, I learned from an ophthalmologist and corneal specialist today, due to infection, emergency corneal transplants are needed for both eyes to help save my vision. I'm a 29 year old single father. I've worked with children all my life and recently graduated from Mediatech Institute ( A recording arts program). I don't have health insurance, and the surgeries will total nearly $12,000. After surgery, it will take up to 3 months for my vision to start to restore, and up to a year for my corneas to heal completely. Any contributions you're able to make, I will be very appreciative. Restoring my vision would be priceless, allowing me to start my career and have a better life for myself and my son.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My eyes started getting worse March of 2012 after rgp contact lenses caused a very bad corneal abrasion. I've had 3 injuries, and 5 emergency visits since. From March 2012 until now my eyes have been constantly irritated and in pain. It was a struggle finishing school. I had to take a 3 month leave of absence due to the injuries and complications with my eyes. As of today emergency surgery is needed, or the Dr. fears I will lose my vision completely because of an infection they found in my left eye. It will take up to a year to recover from the corneal transplant surgeries, and will require life-long medical care. Any contributions made, even if it's $1, will be life changing for me. I'm not able to recognize my son when he's standing right in front of me. The surgeries will allow me to do a lot more with him so he can really have the chance to enjoy his childhood. He turned 5 April 10th.</p>

After the 4 amazing charity projects we have done so far during our AfriQuest, this time we set the bar very high.. What is the most important thing in life?? Water... Imagine your life without water..
According to the UN, 780 million people lack access to clean water ; approximately 1 in 9 people... Our next destination is Sudan, a country where about half the population does not have access to an improved water source, defined as a protected well, standpipe or a handpump within 1 km... scary..



In collaboration with Sadagaat Charity Association, we created the #Water4Life project, in order to build a water well that will give access to safe drinking water for Al Youya village in Barah, North Kordofan State of Sudan.. 
1,200 villagers of which approximately 300 are children, will benefit from this beautiful project!
The need for the project arises from the water shortage suffered in the overall area. Women and children need to walk very long distances to gain access to drinking water. 
The locals are mainly cattle and sheep herders and the lack of water for their herds has resulted in school aged children being sent with the herds to distant watering spots instead of them going to school.



  What We Need & What You Get Construction of the well in Al Youya Village has already begun. We are raising the remaining $8,000 to complete the well. We need to raise this amount to cover the expenses of the water tank, civil works and the solar pump. It is quite a big project and the well will be 25-30 meters deep.

The Impact 


At least 1,200 villagers will gain access to clean safe drinking water


At least 300 school age children will have the chance to continue primary education

<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
<h3>Until August of 2010 I was a very active woman, working full time at my job for over 20 years. I was very much a part of my 4 grandchildrens lives. I was very happy later to learn that I had a new granddaughter which made me 5 wonderful grandchildren. I loved to work out in my yard, work with my flowers and even cut grass. I was an on the run person.</h3>
<h2>My Disorder</h2>
<h3>In August of 2010 I started experiencing severe mucsle contractions and spasms. They started primarily with my face, neck, and back. Progression of my disorder started pretty quickly in which this happened alot more often. In January of 2011 I spent a week in the hospital (which is where this video was taken) to try to figure things out. I was told after a week that I was either faking it or I possibly had dystonia, I was told to go see a neurologist to try to find out. Little did I know that was going to be easier said than done. Dystonia effects only about 1% of the population. Through alot of work and dedication on behalf of my husband and my daughter and their relentless searching in September of 2011 I finally found my neurologist.</h3>
<h2>My Diagnosis</h2>
<h3>I was told that I had secondary cervical dystonia, secondary because it had a cause other than genetic. The cause was medication which medication remains a debate but really does not matter anymore.</h3>
<h2>Secondary Cervical Dystonia</h2>
<h3>Dystonia is a movement disorder in which your brain tells your muscles to move and contract making some muscles over active and other muscles not work at all. There are medications you can take to control the very frequent contractions and spasms which I now know are called dystonic storms. Botox can also be used, my botox has been injected into my neck muscles to help the contractions which have pulled my head off to the left side, I can not lift it or hold it up Thus causing alot of pain in my neck, head and back. The worst part of my diagnosis was being told that there is no cure only things can be tried to make my quality of life better.</h3>
<h2>Where I am Today</h2>
<h3>My head is always tilted off to the left side. The dystonia has progressed to other parts of my body also now, my left hand is closed like a fist and I can not open it, my right foot is turned inward and twisted so that if I try to walk on it I not only walk with it turned in but also on the side of it. I can only walk but a few steps at a time on my own with a cane. My left foot over the last couple of months has started to turn inward also. I am in a power wheel chair now where I spend most of my time. My first botox injection helped about 80% of the time for 5 weeks, my 2nd injection had less results and the 3rd had no good results, in fact I lost the ability to swallow food for about 2 weeks. My neurologist has suggested that I try a surgery that delivers great results in most of the patients that have this done. </h3>
<h2>Deep Brain Stimulation</h2>
<h3>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is essentially a pace maker for the brain. The Dr inserts wire leads with the help of a special MRI to the area of the brain in which the signals are coming from. The wire leads are later connected to a battery pack in the chest. My Dr's would adjust my settings at certain intervals until the desired setting is reached. This could possibly mean the world to me, it could give me back alot of what I have lost. The problem arises finding a Dr that can do this surgery for secondary dystonia. My current neurologist is working hard to find someone for me but it leaves me having to travel to see Dr's and alot of medical bills that are not covered by my insurance. In a couple of weeks I go to the Cleveland Clinic to see if the Dr there can do the surgery for me (I pray he can) if not I am off to Alabama to see the surgeon there. Between the surgery when I get it and the traveling I have done and will have to do, and the medical bills that my insurance HAS NOT AND WILL NOT pay for IS WHY I PRAY FOR YOUR HELP.</h3>
<h2>Imagine If You Will</h2>
<h3>All that I have lost:</h3>
<h3>constant pain, sitting is painful, being out and about in my wheel chair is painful. Any movement or no movement I make during the day is painful. I don't know what I would do without the 350 plus pills I take a month.</h3>
<h3>Not being able to get up and walk, out in the yard with the grandchildren, or even being a part of my own childrens lives in a healthy manner.</h3>
<h3>My youngest granddaughter will be 1 in a week and I have never been able to hold her on my own or even give her a proper hug.</h3>
<h3>Even taking a shower sitting down requires some recovery from the pain of making my muscles do what my brain is telling them not to do.</h3>
<h3>All of my independence, I rely on other people for most everything. There are some chores around the house that I do which I pay the price in the form of pain afterwards.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<h3>Unfortunately I cannot offer any perks. I am willing to keep in contact with anyone that wants to know what happens after the surgery or any updates. This really is all I have to offer.</h3>
<h2>Thank You Very Much For Whatever It Is That You Can Do To Help Me.</h2>

<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>My dear friend of 13 years Sue, has recently found out that she has 2 types of aggressive stage 3 and 4 cancers, lymphoma and breast. Sue has NO Health Insurance or supplemental insurance. Sue has the state supported insurance but it doesn't cover a lot of tests and any experimental trials that she is lucky enough to be a part of. She is self-employed and if she is feeling sick or needs treatment that day, she will not get paid. I started this campaign to make sure Sue has enough money to receive the lifesaving medical treatment that she truly needs. We have all known someone who has lost a friend to cancer. Please help me not lose my friend to cancer and also, provide her with support and love through this time. It is important to let her know that she is not alone. With everyone together, we can help her be stronger than these cancers.</p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal"">We need to raise money to pay for medical treatments, even her basic doctor's visits. She lives in a rural area and is going to need to travel to a bigger area with more testing and treatment options due to the progressive and agressive states of her cancer. She is in desperate need for immediate treatments. As with many who are diagnosed with cancer, no one is quite sure what will be the best course of treatment for Sue or, for how long she will need treatment. We need to raise money not just for treatment but, for the times when she will most certainly not be able to work. No one needs the extra burden of running the risk of losing their home while going through various cancer treatments. Let's make sure Sue doesn't either.</p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""> <strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal"">The impact is HUGE. This is going to be a very challenging year for Sue. But she is strong; she is a fighter, and what a selfless and amazing way to show support and love. Let her know that her community and the world support her in healing. Let her know that she is not alone, that there are people she hasn't even met that are helping her heal.</p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal""> <strong>Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p class=""ecxMsoNormal"">Please, donate today! Every little bit matters. It all adds up. Think about the ""little extras"" we spend each day and take for granted. Maybe today, you could skip your extra latte run?  Maybe you could pool your money with friends or coworkers? Maybe you could collect your loose change as a school charity project? Maybe you could hold a hair auction and see how much you could raise if you shaved your head? There are lots of things you can do to help, some big, some small but, all make a difference, no matter the size of the gesture. If you want to help but, you are unable to donate financially, there are still many ways to support Sue's healing process, no matter what your faith, prayers and healing thoughts are always good and most sincerely needed. If you live close by you could stop by with some cancer friendly food or offer to feed her horses. Maybe you could just bring her some tea and give her a hug, let her know she's supported and loved.</p>

My name is Lisa Kende and I have known Fr. Andrew Recepcion from the
Philippines for many years. When Typhoon Yolanda struck his country last month, I reached
out to him to learn that he nearly lost his life. As he shared about the
enormous loss of life and severe property damage that he witnessed, I was moved
to initiate this campaign to help him to help those who are suffering. EVERY DOLLAR CONTRIBUTED WILL BE USED TO FEED and REBUILD HOMES FOR VICTIMS OF THE TYPHOON and CLASSROOMS FOR CHILDREN.What Each Dollar Buys



$ 25 can buy 55 lbs of rice, enough to feed 100 people

$ 50 can buy 8 bags of cement for foundations

$ 75 can buy 800 square feet of plywood to erect walls

$ 100 can buy 5 metal sheets of roofing material  


$150 can buy enough Christmas Eve meals to feed 10 families in Leyte. Noche Bueno, meaning Good or Holy Night is a Filipino custom referring to the meal served late on Christmas Eve, usually after midnight mass.

$5,000 can go towards the $20,000 cost of building a classroom for 40 - 50 children and would go directly to the department of education 

$5,000 can be given to a local agency like a church-based outreach committee that has already started rebuilding homes for the homeless. 


All contributions go directly to the homeless and hungry displaced from the typhoon through the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), a non-profit, caring for those in the areas hardest hit by the typhoon. The Impact 
During this Christmas and Hanukah season, a time of gift giving, even your small contribution can make a huge difference to a family that has lost everything. Your contribution also offers hope to those who face months, even years of recovering from a storm far worse than any we've ever known here in the U.S.
Fr. Andrew has experience and a fine track record in building very simple and cost-effective shelters for the poorest in the Philippines and he is familiar with the areas hardest hit by Yolanda and knows exactly how and where all contributions can be spent immediately and without needless bureaucracy or extra costs to make the greatest difference for families who cannot survive without outside intervention and aid.
It is our sincere hope that this campaign will raise much more than $5,000 given the enormous task of providing the very minimum for those suffering at this time.


SUMMARYAs I watched news reports on the path and destruction caused by Typhoon Yolanda, described by CNN as ""the strongest storm ever to make landfall in recorded history"", concerned for the safety of those we know in the Philippines, I reached out to two very special priests, relieved to learn that both were safe. However one of them, Fr. Andrew Recepcion, was in the direct path of the storm and nearly lost his life.He wrote:  ""I am finally in Cebu after boarding a military plane from Tacloban Leyte. I almost died in the typhoon. I thought we would not survive. I walked for 24 kilometers to get to the airport passing through dead bodies, chaos, looting, and houses and properties that were totally destroyed and could not keep my tears  not knowing how the people of Leyte can rebuild their lives again. Thank you for those who prayed for me and the people of Leyte. Let us all help them in many ways that we can. The church in Leyte is very much in touch with local people so channeling help through the Archdiocese of Palo, Leyte by way of The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines will make things faster.""About Fr. AndrewFr. Andrew, a man of enormous character, determination and empathy for others, has been actively involved in building shelters for the homeless who live in and around the garbage dumps in the Philippines. He has also long been involved in the Focolare Movement, an ecumenical international organization that promotes the ideals of unity and universal brotherhood to people of all faiths as well as the non-religious. Fr. Andrew has also been blessed with a wonderful singing voice that lifts the spirits of all who hear it.The Typhoon Typhoon Yolanda ravaged the Phillipines on November 8, 2013. Thousands of lives were lost and tens of thousands remain homeless and in dire need of help.  The facts: 
The Manila Times predicts the death toll could soar well over 10,000, with nearly 1,800 people still missing. 3.54 million people have been displaced by Yolanda, the country’s worst recorded natural disaster.


US military's Typhoon Warning Center recorded sustained winds of nearly 200 miles/hour, equivalent to a category 5 hurricane.

The city of Tacloban and outlying provinces of Leyte and Samar, were directly in the path of Yolanda. Devastating winds and two-story high mountainous tsunami-like waves destroyed much of the Tacloban peninsula and reducing entire communities of wooden homes to wet pulp as bodies lay dead in the streets.  


Underestimating Yolanda's force, officials stocked far too few emergency supplies for residents to survive. For example, the 800 five-gallon jugs of water was only enough to sustain less than 2% of the city's population for 24 hours after the storm.          


The majority of those in the storm's path are in dire need of outside assistance for their very survival.  For a timeline of the storm's destruction click here.

<strong>Who are we</strong>?</h2><p>We are Rearguard, a start up in Taiwan, Taipei on a mission to deliver better head protection in HEMA and other combat sports in need of good masks. Our vision is to provide a <strong>safe, affordable mask</strong> that will last, and that offers better protection to the head and neck than other masks on the market.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512817591/bp87pontnkypc0pk774n.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p><strong>Rearguard pre-production sample</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Rearguard?</strong></h2><p>Concussions are becoming an increasing concern in  HEMA. Keith Farrell's paper ""<a href=""http://www.academyofhistoricalarts.co.uk/files/research/keith-farrell/Dementia%20Pugilistica%20in%20HEMA.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dementia Pugilistica in HEMA: Brain Damage from Repeated Head Hits</a>"", is a sobering read. It is widely recognized that the various HEMA back of head protection solutions currently available all have serious drawbacks, and that some of them provide only nominal protection. Several online videos show HEMA fencers being concussed by strikes to the rear of the skull (occipital region), despite wearing widely used back of head protectors costing more than US$60. We need something better.</p><h2><strong>How is Rearguard different?</strong></h2><p>Rearguard is the first HEMA specific mask with integral occipital protection. Current back of head protection typically involves solutions that are:</p><ul>
<li>Soft or only semi-rigid, providing little or no impact protection</li>
<li>Not integral to the mask</li>
<li>Incompatible with good mobility</li>
<li>Only compatible with some masks</li>
<li>Heavy heat traps</li>
</ul><p>Rearguard's key features are:</p><ul>

Our vision is to provide a safe, affordable mask that will last, and that offers better protection to the head and neck than other masks on the market.Rearguard pre-production sampleWhy Rearguard?Concussions are becoming an increasing concern in  HEMA. Keith Farrell's paper ""Dementia Pugilistica in HEMA: Brain Damage from Repeated Head Hits"", is a sobering read. It is widely recognized that the various HEMA back of head protection solutions currently available all have serious drawbacks, and that some of them provide only nominal protection. Several online videos show HEMA fencers being concussed by strikes to the rear of the skull (occipital region), despite wearing widely used back of head protectors costing more than US$60. We need something better.How is Rearguard different?Rearguard is the first HEMA specific mask with integral occipital protection. Current back of head protection typically involves solutions that are:
Soft or only semi-rigid, providing little or no impact protection
Not integral to the mask
Incompatible with good mobility
Only compatible with some masks
Heavy heat traps
Rearguard's key features are:
Steel mesh occipital protection integral to the mask, offering unparalleled rigid protection with low weight and good ventilation
A rigid nape protector (standard for all models), made by Neyman Fencing
Steel bars underneath the front of the mask to protect from heavy overhead blows (Advance & Premium models only)
Competitive retail price at 150$ (even lower when buying from our campaign)
CEN 2 mesh
1600N bib
Rearguard gives you unique optionsRearguard offers a combination of features without peer in the market, with greater protection and convenience at a lower price point than anything else you can buy.The following optional features are also available for Rearguard.
Steel plates (removable), to protect the forehead mesh from repeated strikes
800N aventail (removable), with rigid throat protection
Superior mask liner (removable), with  anti-impact padding that can replace a rugby cap
Deluxe mask liner (removable). with anti-impact padding & high breathability fabric for long term comfort

<br/>You would not think, for example, that a convicted clinic bomber would have a lot of traction with a state medical board. In Kansas, however, Cheryl Sullenger was able to set in motion a case against Dr. Tiller’s former colleague, Dr. Ann Kristin Neuhaus, that in 2012 took away her license to practice medicine, and has driven her to the brink of financial ruin, and may well stick her with the entire cost of the proceedings against her—a whopping $92,672—should she lose her appeal. Was Sullenger a patient of Dr. Neuhaus who had been injured? The parent or spouse of one? No. She is a senior policy adviser to Operation Rescue who served two years in prison for trying to blow up a clinic in California in 1987, and whose phone number was found in the car of Dr. Tiller’s assassin, Scott Roeder. In Kansas, you see, anyone can bring a case against any doctor, and the anti-choice movement takes full advantage of that legal quirk. And so it came about that the clinic bomber drove a compassionate, caring doctor out of medicine and into near-bankruptcy.</blockquote></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><blockquote><div align=""right""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><span class=""""><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><a href=""http://www.thenation.com/article/175959/operation-rescue-vs-dr-ann-neuhaus-hero-provider#axzz2dMxCSnTk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Operation Rescue vs. Dr. Ann Neuhaus, Hero Provider</a> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>

Originally published in the Huffington Post.

This is what the war on abortion access looks like in Kansas: betraying the confidence of medical patients, pretending that forcing 10 year olds to birth rapists' babies is no big deal, bankrupting doctors, driving one man into a frenzy of anti-choice hate so much so that he murders someone, and allowing convicted terrorists to run the whole thing. 
The Deeply Disturbing World of Modern Day Anti-Abortion Activism 
Amanda Marcotte, RH Reality Check

You would not think, for example, that a convicted clinic bomber would have a lot of traction with a state medical board. In Kansas, however, Cheryl Sullenger was able to set in motion a case against Dr. Tiller’s former colleague, Dr. Ann Kristin Neuhaus, that in 2012 took away her license to practice medicine, and has driven her to the brink of financial ruin, and may well stick her with the entire cost of the proceedings against her—a whopping $92,672—should she lose her appeal. Was Sullenger a patient of Dr. Neuhaus who had been injured? The parent or spouse of one? No. She is a senior policy adviser to Operation Rescue who served two years in prison for trying to blow up a clinic in California in 1987, and whose phone number was found in the car of Dr. Tiller’s assassin, Scott Roeder. In Kansas, you see, anyone can bring a case against any doctor, and the anti-choice movement takes full advantage of that legal quirk. And so it came about that the clinic bomber drove a compassionate, caring doctor out of medicine and into near-bankruptcy.Operation Rescue vs. Dr. Ann Neuhaus, Hero Provider 
Katha Pollitt, The Nation
WHY THE $92,672 CAMPAIGN GOAL? 
Dr. Ann Kristin Neuhaus, a former associate of murdered Kansas abortion doctor George Tiller, has for years been paying the price for her commitment to a woman's right to a safe, legal abortion: death threats, having to go to work wearing a bullet-proof vest, even at one point carrying a gun.
Because of that commitment, the Operation Rescue fanatics in Kansas, with the help of a craven bunch of Republican charlatans in state government, have successfully revoked her medical license, and are now seeking to sock her and her family with the bill for all the ""court costs"" of the kangaroo-court-like ""hearing"" by the Kansas Board of Healing Arts whose stacked members stole her hard-earned right to practice medicine.
The bill for this legal lynching: $92,000.

Dave Lindorff, This Can't Be Happening!

The $92,672 campaign goal is symbolic and personal. It is the amount the State of Kansas is seeking to collect for the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts (KSBHA) from me after a highly prejudiced political inquisition. Four of the 9 practicing physicians on the board recused themselves from this judgement against me, but many who are political appointments of Gov. Sam Brownback, are not qualified medical professionals and have taken anti-abortion so-called ""pro-life"" public positions. To see a list of the members for yourself, click here.
I practiced for years, serving thousands of patients as a family physician before 1991. After the 1991 so-called ""Summer of Mercy"" in Wichita, Ks. I helped several doctors who were being victimized for performing abortions in Kansas. 
Years later, after performing nearly 10,000 pregnancy terminations and providing the state-mandated 2nd opinion for patients of the late Dr. George Tiller, KSBHA lawyers and investigators did what their terrorist sympathizers couldn't - financially destroyed me and my family. 
WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL DO IN KANSAS
Some members and employees of KSBHA, Gov. Sam Brownback and a large number of legislators are determined to outlaw safe, legal and clean reproductive health choices for women in Kansas.
Your donation, and the successful culmination of this fundraiser to restore our 10 acre family farm, will send a powerful message for reproductive choice to lawmakers, religious zealots and their terrorist sympathizers in Kansas. A similar life-long message of hope and renewal I gave nearly 10,000 women in my career before being targeted and financially ruined.
I have been persecuted, stalked and the victim of domestic terror campaigns by both the public and underground anti-abortion political groups in Kansas and nationwide. The rate of KSBHA investigations of those providing pregnancy termination is around 50% or higher. For non-providers, it is less than 1%, an astronomical difference and clear evidence of a long-standing prejudicial pattern of administrative practices by the Kansas medical board.
None of my patients have been injured or are party to the complaints filed against me, Instead KSBHA used a complaint filed by a convicted clinic bombing conspirator (one of many of hers that they have pursued over the years) to destroy my career and force my family into bankruptcy.
You can read all the court transcripts, including the former Kansas Attorney General Phil Kline's secret ""Inquisition"" (yes, that is the official term) against Dr. Tiller at my husband's Welcome to Brownbackistan blog. The itemized bill, including the doughnuts, meals and hotel expenses their ""expert"" witness incurred are linked here.
My family needs this money to save our run-down 96 year old farmhouse.
Thank you so much for sharing our concern about the fate of women in 21st Century Kansas, and indeed in much of the United States, 40 years post-Roe v. Wade.

are overexposed to service professions and those jobs will not allow them
economic freedom. Connection with Trailblazers creates a pathway for them to
lead. 
Risks
& Challenges
As
doctorate level scholars and teachers, we have over four decade worth of
experiences working with families, particularly women and girls. Our plan is to
teach these girls the skills necessary for them to succeed in life and to help
their communities

<div>Have you ever questioned the modern medical world, whether for yourself or a loved one?<p>Have anyone ever suggested you take this or that to treat some symptom and you wondered what was really going on?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why it was you really felt like that?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/940808/files/20141018130820-sunshine_beauty.jpg?1413662900"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>My name is Jasmine Bell, I am a 25 year old female with a history of questions such as these. Wondering what it was that caused my ovarian cancer and knowing there was more to it that just spontaneous cancer cells growing at an exponential rate, feeling that there was a root, somewhere, leading deeper than that. Listening to loved ones and professionals alike suggesting I try antidepressants to help me come out of the funk that often consumed my life and not feeling like it was the right solution for me. Feeling again, like there were roots somewhere deep, leading to this feeling, and if I could dig them up, could begin to understand the feelings of foggy reality which would perhaps lead toward clarity and happiness.</p>
<p>My story is that of a survivor, it is a journey that has led me inside myself and around the world. I have read books, searching for knowledge that would led me closer to the right path, tried diets, detoxing and cleaning the physical body. I have turned to alcohol and drugs in an attempt to get some relief from my mind and self if only temporarily. I have tried antidepressants feeling as though my resources and will power were slimming in strength. I've traveled searching for myself in remote areas wondering if maybe it was the environment of which I was accustomed to which brought on this dulled state of being. I have dabbled here and there; energy reiki work and courses, to belief based work such as tarot, to physical massage work and courses. What I have learned has been incredible and I have already come such a long way.</p>
<p>Each step that I have taken, each hole that I have tripped in, has brought me to each moment on each path of my journey, which has led me here, to Pisac, Peru. Everything has been in preparation for the program I am about to embark on. I will not delude myself into believing this will be an easy period in my life by no means, but what I do believe is this it is worth it. I am worth my effort and time and resources. I am worth bettering myself. Finding a way to open my heart and my life so I may truly live. So I may have the energy when I feel drawn to hiking to the top of a mountain to photograph the sun rising over the sister mountains, painting the land with a golden glow, feeling the warmth touch my feet and climbing up to my face. Breathing in the fresh air and knowing that the world is beautiful. That I am beautiful - a unique expression in the universe.</p>
<p>I read a line in ""The Celestine Prophecy"" just the other night that spoke to me. ""Working to establish a more comfortable style of survival has grown to feel complete in and of itself as a reason to live, and we've gradually, methodically, forgotten our original question. . . We've forgotten that we still don't know what we're surviving for.""</p>
<p>I feel it true - many in this world have become so comfortable in modern life that when an illness or incident comes around, they seek the fastest way to feel the way they felt with the same comforts, not listening to the message that is there, quietly trying to gain attention.</p>
<p>My journey is this: To gain understanding. To learn to accept and appreciate. To do everything I can to ensure my cancer will not resurface because I failed to heed the first message. To know love and light and happiness. To move past the addictive, self medicating stage of my life and subconscious beliefs that brought that around. To cure myself of depression. To life a life I am proud of. And to, once I have found my way back into the warmth of the sunlight, to assist others that are searching as I have, for a way to heal themselves.</p>
<p>With each one thing leading to another, whether it be near in the future or distant, events have aligned for me to find myself at Sananda-Wasi in Pisac, Peru. This is a center where the common belief is that the body is more than capable to heal itself from near most illnesses from life threatening cancers including brain tumors and breast cancer to rheumatoid arthritis to even less tangible ailments such as depression.</p>
<p>The program is the Journey to Rejuvenation. It is truly a holistic approach to health providing tools so I made work on healing my physical body, bring understanding, acceptance, and love to my emotional body, bring clarity and decision to my mental body, and provide a safe space for me to strengthen my spiritual body connection. I will be following a diet similar to the Gerson Therepy which is know for it's effectiveness in treating persons with cancer. For the first week, I will be fasting, drinking only juices to kick start a detox while the rest of the program will consist of whole, raw foods and further cleansing my body via colonics. We will often assess and evaluation to make for a very individualized program. But likely, for the first month and a half, there will be absolutely no salt or sugar in the food, eliminating even natural sugars as in fruits. This is to further allow the body to eliminate toxins that have stored up throughout the body. In addition to diet, there will be other modules of healing tools provided such as massage, art therapy, energy healing, meditation, and yoga.</p>
<p>I have found my way here and have spent many tears and time debating on participating in what I knew/know will be a life altering experience. I was on the fence for quite some time because of the cost associated with this three month program. Money is held at such a high value in the western world, and with having this value placed so high throughout my life, my logical mind wondered if it was worth it, I tried justifying it and wondering if I could find the same results in a less expensive way. I went over in my mind how many wonderful experiences I could have with the money, how many new places I could travel and new skills I could learn and train with. Yes, I thought of all this, my head thought a lot about this decision. And in the end, it was not something my head would figure out, it was a decision that came from the heart. My heart. After having come to center, meeting the family here, feeling how much they love and believe in what they do and how much love they hold in their hearts, so much that there is more that enough overflowing. The team here is beautiful. I asked many questions, I wanted a clear idea to help me make my decision. But really, once I felt how I felt here, I knew how much healing has already and will continue to happen here and I figured, if this isn't worth it, if I am not worth it... Than what is?</p>
<p>The process began there, with that decision, and continues, with me writing this. Explaining who and where I am to the world at large, trusting, in myself and in you, to believe in more than what's expected.. but to go further, and to believe in the self, and to believe in me.</p>
<p>I am offering my photography in exchange for assistance. When I hold a camera in my hand, I become present, aware, awake, and I appreciate the beauty. I wanted to share more than just my story and my gratitude... I feel to share a part of my heart, my soul, and the world as I see it.</p>

<p>WHO IS NODAS</p>
<p>My name is Zoe Peraki 42 and I live in Thessaloniki Greece.
This picture is of my best friend Nondas Nikolaidis 49 a wonderful person, husband, father of a thirteen year old girl, amazing kindergarden teacher and a dear friend to many. 
Nondas had a terrible accident last January.He fell off his roof while repairing the side wall and fell 11 metres down onto the ground. He suffered many injuries and a severe head trauma. He had surgery as soon as his condition stabilised, and remained in the I.C.U. for 20 days.He was then hospitalised for over a month and has been in a Rehabilitation Center ever since, slowly regaining consciousness and movement ability. We have been very lucky up to now, as hundreds of people came together and offered as much help as possible in order to pay for all the expenses that arose. 
Last month Nondas went under surgery again for Cranial Reconstruction surgery plus he had a special device inserted in his brain to help his brain fluid flow better. The surgery cost 10.000 euros and it was needed to protect his brain from any future infections or trauma, and speed up his return home to his family and friends. Now due to the crisis in Greece we have been told that Nondas must return home because his health insurance will not renew his stay at the rehab center for more than another month. We actually need a few more months but the cost of each month is over 5000 euros, an amount of money his family has no way of collecting . Also his situation demands of many other health and day to day expences that is bringing his family down to their knees financialy.Nondas needs intense physiotherapy, speech therapy and medical treatment 24/7 and an early return back home might compromise all that the doctors have been trying to do for him at ""AROGI"" <a href=""http://www.euromedica-arogi.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.euromedica-arogi.gr/</a> 
If you can help us collect this amount , Nondas will have a better chance to focus on his other disabilities, so that maybe one day he will be able to return to his classroom, and his family won't suffer the endless delays of the Greek national health system which is currently disintegrating due to the crisis. </p>
<p>WHY HELP?</p>
<p> Nondas is a wonderful person. Since a young man he has been around children and young people offering knowledge and help. He has been a guardian for children with special needs, for underprivileged children, for children with chronic diseases. He is a successful kindergarden<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> teacher and thousands of children were lucky to start their schooling around him.
Nodas also performs puppet theatre with his own handmade puppets, and reads children's books at all sorts of events, mostly at no charge and just to see a smile on a child’s face....!!!
Please help us to get Nondas back to the children where he belongs. Your contribution would make a great difference to his life, his care, his family ,his friends and to so many young lives who love him and miss him dearly.

<p>As you know, Jen has been battling Stage 3 melanoma cancer since May of last year. The last 18 months have been filled with surgeries, hospital stays, MRI/CT/PET scans, and an entire year of chemotherapy. Through all of that, many of you have blessed our family in multiple ways. You have prayed for us. You have encouraged us. You have brought meals to us. You have kept us laughing and smiling, even in the midst of all the suffering cancer brings. We are beyond grateful.</p>
<p>So, it is with a fair amount of trepidation that we even make this next request. Cancer is expensive, and it has finally caught up with us in the last few months. Jen's specific chemotherapy treatment alone runs us almost $1000 every month. Regular doctor visits, biopsies, scans, and other expenses add up on top of that. </p>
<p>Let me be clear. We will be able to eventually pay these bills. We've been adjusting as a family throughout the year (postponing vacations, cutting expenses, etc…), and we'll continue to do so. But, there are a few reasons we've decided to reach out. First, Jen's chemotherapy treatment finishes August 1st, and she'll begin the long process of recovering her strength (physical, mental, and emotional) while also weaning herself off high doses of pain medication. Reducing these medical expenses will go a long way toward eliminating one less thing for her to worry about. Second, and I know this may sound crazy, but we are excited to begin fostering children again. We've had to take a break for obvious reasons, and we don't feel comfortable resuming foster care until we've reduced these bills. Finally, many of you have asked for ways you can continue to help our family beyond prayers, meals, and encouragement. We've done our best to keep finances out of the picture, but they are unfortunately very real and continue to mount. They are a definite need, and if helping financially is something you feel led to, we want to make that an option.</p>
<p>So, if you would like to contribute, we would be extremely grateful. In fact, we have a special T-shirt for anyone donating $25 or more as a way to celebrate Jen's chemotherapy coming to an end. The amazingly talented Brian Brasher kindly created two amazing designs for you to choose from, and we'd be stoked to see everyone rocking these shirts. In typical Jen fashion, she has decided to ride the 100 mile LiveStrong challenge at the end of October to celebrate. We've created a LiveStrong team named Derailing Cancer (haha, cycling joke), so the T-shirt designs reflect that idea.</p>
<p>We're going to run this campaign all the way up to Jen's final CT/PET scans on October 3rd. That's when we'll hopefully hear the doctor say ""No Evidence of Disease."" That will be a big day, and it seems fitting to end on such a big day.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, I just want to say how much everyone's support over the last 18 months has meant to me and our family. We could not have done this without the love and support of so many family and friends. The majority of patients don't continue the full year on this chemotherapy treatment because it's so difficult, but Jen will soon be done with the entire year. You have all helped make that possible. Whether you can donate or not, know that we treasure your friendship more than these words can say. Thank you so much.</p>

<li>
<strong>How Does Sizing Work?</strong><ul>
<li>Once the campaign closes, we will send a survey to all supporters to select their preferred CorePro sizes</li>
<li>CorePro is a unisex product that fits both men and women based on a measurement taken around your belly button.</li>
<li>CorePro comes in 7 sizes that fit waists that range in size from 25 inches - 47 inches (measured around your belly button)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What if CorePro doesn’t have my size?</strong><ul>
<li>Currently CorePro accommodates individuals who measure 25"" - 47"" around their trunk at the height of the belly button.</li>
<li>We recognize that this may limit our ability to serve everyone and we greatly appreciate your understanding in our inability to accommodate everyone at this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>How can CorePro help with my posture?</strong><ul>
<li>It can help to cue better posture and activation of abdominal muscles when they are usually dormant (slouching at the desk), especially if you are sitting for extended periods of time.</li>
<li>When sitting upright, your body needs to use your abdominal wall to keep you in a good position.  CorePro is a physical reminder not to slouch as well as an active trigger for your core muscles to maintain proper position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Will CorePro mask back pain?</strong><ul><li>It will not mask pain. It's not rigid, and therefore doesn’t limit/block movement. If pain is from movement, this will not restrict movement. If you are experiencing pain, please remember to consult your medical provider</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Is the goal to help me move through pain?</strong><ul><li>No. The goal is to re-educate/activate your deep abdominal wall (some of the main stabilizing muscles for your spine). Many people have lost the ability to activate these muscles for stabilization and/or they have an inadequate endurance of these muscles. When the spine is not well stabilized it can cause pain.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Should I wear it even if I don’t have back pain or back issues?</strong><ul><li>If you don’t have trouble with your back, but know you have a core weakness then it can help and be proactive in avoiding possible back issues. Core weakness can be from poor fitness, pregnancy, abdominal surgery, hours at a desk, etc.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<strong>Will CorePro give me 6-pack abs?</strong><ul>
<li>Unfortunately, no.  :(</li>
<li>CorePro is designed to engage your deep abdominal stabilizing muscles under your rectus abdominis (commonly known as 6-pack).</li>

<p>Take a few seconds to re-posture yourself right now. If you’re sitting, chances are your back isn’t touching your chair at all. That’s because most chairs aren’t ergonomic, and many actually encourage bad posture. BetterBack makes every chair ergonomic. Sit effortlessly in perfect posture at your desk. Or on a plane.

<p>A few years ago, in the lovely year of 2012, I was the co-founder of a startup, <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apps-the-tech-world-loves-2013-2#everest-helps-you-break-down-big-tasks-making-them-more-achievable-8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Everest</a>, that was building technology to help people live their dreams and achieve personal goals. I was mostly in front of a computer 12+ hours a day, but we also put on the Dream Series, which were meaningful events to help kickstart people's dreams. A few hours after an amazing obstacle course run through Golden Gate Park, my sciatica pain began. The pain and discomfort made it hard to concentrate, do great work and enjoy life.</p>

<p><b>How comfortable are the knee straps?</b></p>
<p>I have absolutely terrible knees (at one point I was put in two leg casts because of feet and knee injuries, later having surgery on my right knee).

<p><b>Can I wear BetterBack while I drive?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no. BetterBack is not safe to wear driving, or when you need quick leg mobility. It is great for sitting at your desk, eating, meeting, going to a movie, sitting on an airplane, meditating, etc. Note: you can wear BetterBack cross-legged! </p>

How is your back? And your neck? Probably not too great. Or you’re already in so much pain that someone sent you here (hugs). BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain.
 
 
Highlights


BetterBack® makes every chair ergonomic – Instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one chair, you can make every chair ergonomic. Lightweight and portable, you can throw BetterBack in your purse or backpack.

Next gen back support –  The keystone to good posture is the pelvis. Traditional back supports only focus on your lumbar spine. BetterBack stabilizes your pelvis, restoring your spine's natural curvature, and provides lumbar support. 

15 minutes a day – Like dumbbells at a gym, BetterBack helps you build up your posture muscles. Wear it for as little as 15 minutes a day to achieve great posture when you stand or sit on your own.



Reviews







 

Good posture boosts your mood, confidence, motivation and overall health.  
Take a few seconds to re-posture yourself right now. If you’re sitting, chances are your back isn’t touching your chair at all. That’s because most chairs aren’t ergonomic, and many actually encourage bad posture. BetterBack makes every chair ergonomic. Sit effortlessly in perfect posture at your desk. Or on a plane. Or at a game. You get the idea.
 
 
You get fast results and long term comfort. Put BetterBack on in 5 seconds flat!

They told us to make it portable, make it durable, make it visible, make it sexy. So we did. After constant refining & testing, Timebirds took flight.  
Battle tested & approved by top athletes, gyms, trainers, and servicemen and women   Designed for all sports, training & skill levels Why do people love Timebirds?

 
 

 
We designed Timebirds specifically for you to get the most out of every workout.And people took notice...Gold award winning design Because a timer should be durable, easy to use, and highly visible...And go with you everywhere...Timebirds vs Your Current TimerIn most forms of training, you want a constantly visible time-source, keeping you accountable and getting the most out of each and every workout.While there are many timing solutions on the market, none are versatile enough to be clearly seen and heard in multiple situations, while also giving the confidence that they will survive the rigors of the workout environment.We’ve made Timebirds small enough to fit in your pocket but large enough to see during a workout. Timebirds' long-life battery and fast charging mean your workout is not limited by power point access. You can take it wherever you go.  The sleek design has been considered both inside and out, to maximize durability.Timebirds have a consolidated circuit board that is fixed directly to the housing, strengthened further by inner ribs. This means there are no loose components. The thick, scratch-resistant, polycarbonate lens snaps directly into the housing, eliminating pressure points.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is a side-line project that Dean and I are working on at Fluxx (<a href=""http://www.fluxx.uk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fluxx.uk.com</a>) -  a product and service innovation company.</p>
<p>Originally I asked Dean to help me build a slightly simpler version of this as I was sick of waiting for ages for my bus, or missing my bus, even though the stop is only a few minutes from my house.</p>
<p>The Transport for London (TFL) bus data source is relatively recent but it covers all of London, is pretty accurate and easy to access, but by the time I've found and opened an app, I might as well have just gone to the bus stop. The idea of departure boards is that it's always on, and easy to glance at on your wall at home or at work, making the information much more useful and timely. It's the same insight that led all smartphone makers to put the time on the lock screen rather than bury it in an app.</p>
<p>People in the office saw the prototype develop and quickly I started to get requests to make more. So we're wondering how wide that demand might be. The aim is to raise enough to work up a design for a product that can be mass produced (including the software needed to make it easy to control the device through the internet).</p>
<p>If we can get this first, simple product off the ground, we have plans to extend it for other services (such as rail, weather and your kids' gym kit), and some pretty exciting ideas for next stage physical devices.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>We would
like to gauge interest in the device by raising enough money to make 20 prototype devices to put out on Alpha test.</p>
<p>For
anyone who supports us with over £50, we will build you a device, pre-programmed
to your specific bus stops, and you will become one of our Alpha testers. We

This is a side-line project that Dean and I are working on at Fluxx (www.fluxx.uk.com) -  a product and service innovation company.
Originally I asked Dean to help me build a slightly simpler version of this as I was sick of waiting for ages for my bus, or missing my bus, even though the stop is only a few minutes from my house.
The Transport for London (TFL) bus data source is relatively recent but it covers all of London, is pretty accurate and easy to access, but by the time I've found and opened an app, I might as well have just gone to the bus stop. The idea of departure boards is that it's always on, and easy to glance at on your wall at home or at work, making the information much more useful and timely. It's the same insight that led all smartphone makers to put the time on the lock screen rather than bury it in an app.
People in the office saw the prototype develop and quickly I started to get requests to make more. So we're wondering how wide that demand might be. The aim is to raise enough to work up a design for a product that can be mass produced (including the software needed to make it easy to control the device through the internet).
If we can get this first, simple product off the ground, we have plans to extend it for other services (such as rail, weather and your kids' gym kit), and some pretty exciting ideas for next stage physical devices.
What We Need & What You Get
We would
like to gauge interest in the device by raising enough money to make 20 prototype devices to put out on Alpha test.
For
anyone who supports us with over £50, we will build you a device, pre-programmed
to your specific bus stops, and you will become one of our Alpha testers. We
won’t ask for the device back at the end of the trial, and it will still work.
We are prepared to consider requests for it to be coded in other ways, e.g. to
weather or train times. Provided they have an accessible data feed, we can
consider it.
This
trial will allow us to gather enough evidence to drive our next campaign which
will seek to take us towards mass production, in which we will:

Develop the setup experience
     - getting it seamlessly onto wifi
Create the customisation
     interface - making it easy to code the device to your needs
Plan the mass production and
     tooling requirements

The ImpactWe think this is just one idea for humanising the sort of technology normally accessed from smartphones. Why not incorporate data like this more directly in your physical surroundings?
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you don't want to contribute cash, we'd love to hear your ideas for similar products and markets.

How it works
A few people have asked questions about what the device actually does and how it works. So the device has two 10-LED arrays. As it currently stands, the top 10 LEDs provide a count down to the next bus at the stop outside my house in a simple way: 10 LEDs = 10 mins or more to the bus, 9 LEDs = 9 mins etc. When it gets close (under 1 min), the function switches to 1 LED = 6 seconds, and the whole lot flash. In my case, this is the point at which I need to get out the door or I will miss the bus. It would be possible to add a time difference (e.g. if it's  a five minute walk to the stop, we could subtract 5 mins from all the times). Obviously, in the long term, we'd be hoping this could be the sort of configuration the user could self-manage.
The second set of 10 LEDs shows the second bus. This is most useful when two buses are close together, meaning you've got a little longer before you need to rush off.
The design approach is that the device should be inconspicuous and its purpose not obvious. We hope to make the case more simple and elegant in future iterations (currently white plastic).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h4><p>On November 3rd, while building his own home in Snohomish, Washington, our friend Dan Wetzel had a nail deflected deep into his eye. As Dan and his wife Teresa had recently moved back to the Seattle area to be near their children and grand children, they did not yet have insurance coverage at their new jobs. The accident has resulted in loss of sight, loss of job, an unfinished home, and $35,000 dollars in medical bills to date with additional surgery and other medical services needed.<br/></p><h4></h4>We first met Dan and Teresa while building our own home in Southern Utah in 2003.

He is an outstanding craftsman and at the same time one of the most humble men I know. Dan is the kind of guy everyone enjoys working with because he tackles every task with positive energy and a great sense of humor. Dan and Teresa thoroughly enjoyed exploring southern Utah for 10 years but family drew them back to the Seattle area in late 2012.<br/><br/><b>We want to help Dan and Teresa because they are not only really great people

<b><br/></b><div>Monitors core body temperature to notify parent, family member, caregivers, via Bluetooth™- to mobile devices of changes so appropriate action can be taken, when needed. </div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>ThermoBand is device provides comfort of constant fever monitoring and peace of mind in knowing that your loved one's temperature is constantly monitored. ThermoBand is a device that is based on the idea of recording the changes in temperature of the body instead of the absolute temperature. </p>
<p></p>ThermoBand provides an accurate body temperature of your child who is suffering from fever.</div>
<div>ThermoBand apparatus is a device based on the idea of detecting temperature changes and not absolute temperature. </div>
<div>
<br/><p><b>HOW DOES IT WORK</b></p>
<p>Our device is based on the idea of detecting the change in temperature of the body. Thus, we can use the skin temperature as a parameter for measuring core temperature variation. Our temperature sensing band aid will be fixed on the forehead/body of your child. If the fever of your child increases at night, it will generate the alarm. Now, suppose a condition that your child is suffering from a <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">102 degree F temperature at 10 PM. The only way to keep an eye on the temperature is that you don’t sleep, wake the child from time to time for the inspecting the fever. Or the other option is to use this device and it will keep complete monitoring of your child’s health. Also, it will warn you before the situation becomes severe.</span></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">YOUR CHILD</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> comes home from school one day not feeling well. By the end of the night, he is coughing and has a fever of 99. You take his temperature before he goes to sleep. It is now pushing 101. </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">YOU</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> give him/her a fever reducer. He goes to sleep, but you don’t. You go into your bedroom, lay down and set your alarm for an hour so you can check on your son and see if the fever reducing medication is working. You check his fever again and it has gone down to 101. You set your alarm to check on him in another hour. You worry and lose sleep.</span><br/></p>
<p>Next time your child gets down with a fever, ThermoBand is the device you should use. With this, you will not have to check your child’s fever with a thermometer every 2-3 hours. Also, it will allow you to understand whether the medicine treatment which you have opted for is actually showing its effect or not.</p>

<p><b>TEAM BEHIND THE INNOVATION</b></p>
<p>At FirstWearable, we’re a group of professionals who are passionate about creating innovative products that simplify everyday life. We’re tireless in our pursuit to discover new solutions. Our goal is to make life easier and more efficient. </p>
<p>Fevers are one of the most upsetting and erratic maladies that people face. If the body temperature rises, severe measures may need to be taken. Doctors recommend that if temperatures continue to exceed 101 degrees after receiving fever-reducing medicines, a wet pack or sponge should be applied. If a person’s temperature rises above 104 degrees rashes may appear and emergency room visit is urgently necessary. Keeping all the inconvenience and fears that a fever causes, we thought of creating a product which could help the parents alleviate their worries. And, so the idea of bringing FirstWearable into existence clicked us.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS OUR GOAL</b></p>
<p>We are aiming to develop a secure and easy-to-wear gadget that is highly reliable and safe for the users. One can easily and efficiently keep an eye on the body temperature of the kids; adults as well. This gadget is easy to use as compared       to the traditional thermometers, especially when you need close monitoring of the patient.</p>
<p>ThermoBand can greatly help children in communities with limited hospitals and clinics, as well as limited financial and medical resources. Many children are fortunate enough to have caring parents who can monitor their sickness and fever, but we recognize there are also those who do not. For many there are fever reducing medications in the next room, but for many there are not. Our goal as we build ThermoBand’s financial profitability to is to utilize our innovation to help children who suffer from a lack of care and resources. In the U.S, that might be providing ThermoBand to a clinic servicing a poor neighborhood. Abroad, it may mean supplying the local physician an ability to monitor many children suffering from an epidemic. It should be understood, we have no desire nor intention to use our philanthropic vision and goals a marketing tactic. No “one for one.” No “1 dollar of each product purchased.” Very simply put, our firm’s goal is to make everyone’s lives simpler and better.</p>
<p><b>Monetary Goals</b></p>
<p><b>At $75,000,</b> we will upgrade the product by adding more reliable sensors and integrating the product to one’s cell phone via GPS. Getting a warning alarm or message on a cell phone will help you in even close and efficient monitoring.</p>

</div></div>","WHAT  ""THERMOBAND"" DOES 
Monitors core body temperature to notify parent, family member, caregivers, via Bluetooth™- to mobile devices of changes so appropriate action can be taken, when needed. 


ThermoBand is device provides comfort of constant fever monitoring and peace of mind in knowing that your loved one's temperature is constantly monitored. ThermoBand is a device that is based on the idea of recording the changes in temperature of the body instead of the absolute temperature. 
ThermoBand provides an accurate body temperature of your child who is suffering from fever.
ThermoBand apparatus is a device based on the idea of detecting temperature changes and not absolute temperature. 

HOW DOES IT WORK
Our device is based on the idea of detecting the change in temperature of the body. Thus, we can use the skin temperature as a parameter for measuring core temperature variation. Our temperature sensing band aid will be fixed on the forehead/body of your child. If the fever of your child increases at night, it will generate the alarm. Now, suppose a condition that your child is suffering from a 102 degree F temperature at 10 PM. The only way to keep an eye on the temperature is that you don’t sleep, wake the child from time to time for the inspecting the fever. Or the other option is to use this device and it will keep complete monitoring of your child’s health. Also, it will warn you before the situation becomes severe.
YOUR CHILD comes home from school one day not feeling well. By the end of the night, he is coughing and has a fever of 99. You take his temperature before he goes to sleep. It is now pushing 101. YOU give him/her a fever reducer. He goes to sleep, but you don’t. You go into your bedroom, lay down and set your alarm for an hour so you can check on your son and see if the fever reducing medication is working. You check his fever again and it has gone down to 101. You set your alarm to check on him in another hour. You worry and lose sleep.
Next time your child gets down with a fever, ThermoBand is the device you should use. With this, you will not have to check your child’s fever with a thermometer every 2-3 hours. Also, it will allow you to understand whether the medicine treatment which you have opted for is actually showing its effect or not.


 WHY THERMOBAND?ThermoBand is a modern innovation, which measures the body temperature changes caused due to fever. 
We know that the exact body temperature is not easy to measure. The temperature probe has to be placed in body cavities or swallowed to get right body temperature. The skin temperature usually has no relation to core temperature, and therefore it gets tricky to use unwearable device for the purpose.

<p>What if there were another way, a new way that can restore the GIFT of vibrant health for many more productive years?</p>
<p>By a series of unusual circumstances I see as His grace, The Lord made me aware that there IS another way.  The US-based Munogenics company, (<a href=""http://www.munogenics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.munogenics.com</a>) has developed it.  It's called GIFT and it's a breakthrough new nontoxic cancer treatment now in clinical trials on the very first human test subjects in Pune, India.  Munogenics calls me ""an excellent candidate"" and has already accepted me as a test subject.

<p>My name is Stephanie Stuart Trinder, the mother of a
determined and spunky two-year-old and the COO of small non-profit called
Wild4life operating in the western tip of Zimababwe. While visiting our
programs in August, I met a little boy named Nqobizitha (""Conquerer""
in English) and his mother, Precious. At the time, Conquerer was two,
considerably small for his age and unable to walk as a result of having a
condition called hydrocephalus, also known as “water on the brain.” What
struck me about Precious was her grace as she looked so adoringly at her son
and pleaded for help. She told me how her husband recently left her because he
considers Conquerer a curse to the family. As with many children in this area,
Precious (one of seven children) finished school at 15 because her parents
couldn't afford school fees. At 19 she has no job.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/272185/files/20131220192706-DSC_0841_-_Version_3.jpg?1387596426"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>A mother myself, it was impossible
not to relate to Precious, but even more difficult not to compare Conquerer's
limitations to my toddler who is thriving here in the US. Conquerer's condition
falls outside of the mandate of our organization, and it became apparent that
helping him would become a personal mission. </p>
<p>I soon discovered that Conquerer was
not the only child in the community with hydropcephalus. Another boy, Praise,
is a seven-year-old unable to use his legs. Praise moves around by lifting his
legs and shuffling along the ground. His mother died when he was just a year
old and he's now cared for by his grandmother while his father looks after his
other two children and struggles to make enough money to get Praise treatment.
Until now, Praise has received some medical attention, but his father can no
longer afford any treatment. Despite his challenges, Praise speaks four
languages and is a clever boy, but needs full-time care to carry out basic
daily functions, which is more than his 63-year-old grandmother can shoulder on
top of taking care of seven other grandchildren.</p>
<p><b>Not only will Conquerer and Praise
never develop like young children should, they can die if they don't receive
the appropriate treatment.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>What We Need</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Like much of the medical treatment we
take for granted in the US, what is considered an accessible and routine
procedure in the developed world is entirely unaffordable and unavailable to
these little boys in Zimbabwe. However, there is a US-based organization called
CURE that runs a hospital in Lusaka, Zambia (about 400 miles away, an overnight
bus ride for these family) that will treat these two children at no cost to the
families. </p>
<p>My goal is to raise enough money to get these children and
their parents the passports, transportation and food they need to travel to
Lusaka and stay at this incredible facility (<a href=""http://cure.org/hospitals/zambia/#about"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><span>http://cure.org/hospitals/zambia/#about</span></b></a>)
while the boys get the appropriate treatment. This will cost $1,250 per child,
which means we need your help raising $2,500. <b>We must get these children
quality treatment as soon as possible, before it is too late. Please consider
giving to this campaign, even a small amount matters. </b>I will be back in
Zimbabwe in the coming year, and I hope to be able to report to you that Conquerer
and Praise are thriving. </p>

<p></p></div>","My name is Stephanie Stuart Trinder, the mother of a
determined and spunky two-year-old and the COO of small non-profit called
Wild4life operating in the western tip of Zimababwe. While visiting our
programs in August, I met a little boy named Nqobizitha (""Conquerer""
in English) and his mother, Precious. At the time, Conquerer was two,
considerably small for his age and unable to walk as a result of having a
condition called hydrocephalus, also known as “water on the brain.” What
struck me about Precious was her grace as she looked so adoringly at her son
and pleaded for help. She told me how her husband recently left her because he
considers Conquerer a curse to the family. As with many children in this area,
Precious (one of seven children) finished school at 15 because her parents
couldn't afford school fees. At 19 she has no job.
A mother myself, it was impossible
not to relate to Precious, but even more difficult not to compare Conquerer's
limitations to my toddler who is thriving here in the US. Conquerer's condition
falls outside of the mandate of our organization, and it became apparent that
helping him would become a personal mission. 
I soon discovered that Conquerer was
not the only child in the community with hydropcephalus. Another boy, Praise,
is a seven-year-old unable to use his legs. Praise moves around by lifting his
legs and shuffling along the ground. His mother died when he was just a year
old and he's now cared for by his grandmother while his father looks after his
other two children and struggles to make enough money to get Praise treatment.
Until now, Praise has received some medical attention, but his father can no
longer afford any treatment. Despite his challenges, Praise speaks four
languages and is a clever boy, but needs full-time care to carry out basic
daily functions, which is more than his 63-year-old grandmother can shoulder on
top of taking care of seven other grandchildren.
Not only will Conquerer and Praise
never develop like young children should, they can die if they don't receive
the appropriate treatment.
What We Need
Like much of the medical treatment we
take for granted in the US, what is considered an accessible and routine
procedure in the developed world is entirely unaffordable and unavailable to
these little boys in Zimbabwe. However, there is a US-based organization called
CURE that runs a hospital in Lusaka, Zambia (about 400 miles away, an overnight
bus ride for these family) that will treat these two children at no cost to the
families. 
My goal is to raise enough money to get these children and
their parents the passports, transportation and food they need to travel to
Lusaka and stay at this incredible facility (http://cure.org/hospitals/zambia/#about)
while the boys get the appropriate treatment. This will cost $1,250 per child,
which means we need your help raising $2,500. We must get these children
quality treatment as soon as possible, before it is too late. Please consider
giving to this campaign, even a small amount matters. I will be back in
Zimbabwe in the coming year, and I hope to be able to report to you that Conquerer
and Praise are thriving.

</h3><h3>Christen White [1979-2002]</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>September 12, 2000.  I
get a call from the Emergency Room at The University of Tennessee Medical Center
in Knoxville where my 20-year-old daughter Christen was taken when she fainted
at the UT Library.  It’s a doctor who is
telling me that he thinks she might have primary pulmonary hypertension and
that this is a very serious situation.  I
tell him I’ll be on the next flight down.</p>
<p>Is this related to the shortness of breath she’s been having
for a couple of years, I wonder? Her doctor at home told her she should lose
some weight and that would probably solve that problem. Lately she’d been
having trouble climbing stairs, but still the doctor didn’t seem very
concerned. Lose weight, he said.</p>
<p>But now it turns out she might have a fatal disease that
seemed to have snuck up on us without warning. I mean, if her doctor wasn’t
concerned about the shortness of breath, why should we be worried, right? </p>
<p>When I get to Knoxville, Christen is in Intensive Care. The
doctors tell me they have done a right heart catheterization and have confirmed
the diagnosis: it’s pulmonary hypertension and they don’t know what caused it.  They tell me to get her to an academic
medical center where they can care for her. And they tell me the illness she
has is often fatal within two years of diagnosis.</p>
<p>I call my cousin who is a pulmonologist and tell him what’s
going on. Take Christen to an academic medical center, he says. She’s at an
academic medical center now, I say, and they’re telling me to take her
someplace else. My cousin says to take her wherever they suggest because he’s
not familiar with the options in the south. The UT doctors suggest two places
and we pick the one closest to Christen’s home.</p>
<p>We go there and she is placed on a drug called Flolan – a
drug administered by a small pump through a tube in her chest. They scare the
hell out of us by saying that if the pump fails or if the tube pulls out, she’s
likely to die in minutes. We are reeling from the devastating diagnosis.</p>
<p>After a week in the hospital she goes home and later goes
back to school, although her doctor tells her not to. She wants to finish her
final semester and get married. It’s unclear whether this is a bad idea or not,
and we’re not getting very much in the way of answers.</p>

<p>June, 2001:  After
being very unhappy with the follow up care and the lack of information,
Christen asks to be taken to the other option we were given in Knoxville,
namely The Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. </p>
<p>It is now about two and a half years since Christen first
began experiencing shortness of breath and nine months since her diagnosis, and
we still have not regained our balance. We’re still reeling. We’re in denial
about how bad this can be. We’re scared and confused.</p>
<p>The doctors and nurses at Vanderbilt seem to know what
they’re doing and we’re feeling more confident. Then they tell Christen that
her disease is advanced and that she needs a heart-lung transplant. We look
into what this is about and learn that while it is the only ultimate solution
for pulmonary hypertension, it comes with its own dire consequences, including
death during surgery and a poor prognosis after that. She decides to wait. We
want to support her as best we can, but have no idea what the best thing is to do or where to find out. This is before we knew of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association.</p>
<p>May 2002:  It’s been
almost a year since Christen went to Vanderbilt and she seems to be doing okay
– not great, but okay.  She calls to tell
me she has a scholarship to attend the Pulmonary Hypertension Association’s
Conference in California and asks if I’ll go with her.</p>
<p>In June at the Conference in California it becomes clearer
to Christen and me just how sick she really is. I had just seen her in April
and now a couple of months later she is clearly doing much worse. I still can’t
believe in my heart what my head is telling me: Christen is dying. I get the
feeling she knows this, but she doesn’t say it.</p>
<p>Through the summer and into the fall I speak with her almost
daily and with her mother weekly. I can tell things are not going well. Her
nurse at Vanderbilt says there are no other options other than a transplant.
Christen agrees to go on the transplant list, but there are examinations and
interviews that have to happen before that can be finalized.</p>
<p>October 19, 2002: Christen flies to New Jersey to visit us
and, when I pick her up at the airport she can barely walk. I say this trip was
not a good idea and wish I had not agreed to it. She stays a week and spends
most of the time sitting on the sofa. Her hands and feet are cold and she aches
all over. I begin to suspect that the end is coming, but push the thought out of
my mind whenever it intrudes. Christen says don’t worry, Dad. I’m seeing my
doctor in Nashville next week and we’ll figure something out.</p>
<p>So off she goes to Nashville for what she thought was a
routine visit.  She arrived at the
hospital on Tuesday with her mother. She was unexpectedly admitted to the
hospital. I arrived on Thursday and stayed with Christen in her room. On Friday
morning her doctor told us that her heart was dangerously enlarged and that
there was nothing that could be done. He told her she had weeks, maybe days to
live. </p>
<p>By Saturday, November 2 all of her family was gathered
around her, and after she has spent a little time with everyone she lost
consciousness</p>
<p>Christen died just after midnight on Sunday, November 3,
2002 – 782 days after being diagnosed and God only knows how long after
experiencing her first symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.</p>

<h3>What Is Needed</h3>
<p>Kids are not ""miniature adults"".  So the treatments available for adults with pulmonary hypertension don't work the same way for kids. Research on treatments for pediatric pulmonary hypertension lags about 10 years behind research for adult treatments  That's why there is an urgent need for research funds and for funds to mentor young physicians in the field. Please help us close this gap by making a generous contribution to the Robyn Barst Pediatric Research Fund.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who Was Robyn Barst?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Robyn Barst graduated from medical school in 1979 and began a long career in pediatric cardiology. In the 1980s there was only a handful of doctors around the world who were interested in pulmonary hypertension and Dr. Barst was virtually the <i>only</i> doctor in the world interested in <i>pediatric</i> pulmonary hypertension. She was a pioneer in the field and had a hand in every major development in the field from the early 1980s right up until her death in April, 2013.  </p>
<p>She was mentor and teacher to virtually all of the top physicians around the world who specialize in pediatric PH. Over the course of her career she published a total of 1,861 scholarly articles in medical journals, most of them concerning pulmonary hypertension. That is an astounding rate of <i>more than one article a week</i> for 34 years!</p>
<p>When she was diagnosed with lung cancer she made the decision to provide the seed money for a fund to sponsor medical research in the field of pediatric pulmonary hypertension and to provide mentoring to young doctors entering the field. </p>
<p>We can honor her memory and her dedicated career by helping expand the fund so that more awards to young scientists and clinicians can be awareded each year.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The field of adult pulmonary hypertension research has advanced dramatically over the last 10 years. Together, we can make the same thing happen for kids with PH by contributing a little or a lot to the Robyn Barst Pediatric Research Fund. Through research, we will find better treatments, and ultimately a cure for PH. </p>
<p>A contribution of ANY amount will make an important difference in the lives of thousands of kids. You can help save <i>many</i> lives even with a small donation.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<div>
<p>If you live in our Northern California delivery area or near one of our five pickup locations, you can be one of the first to experience our yogurt by pre-ordering through this campaign.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to select the right yogurt pre-order perk:</p>
<p><b>1. Select your perk size - Small, Medium, or Large</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444698926/is9goox2vndksc0rwplv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<p><b><i>The shelf life of our product is at least 40 days (about 6 weeks)</i></b>. Each 24-oz container holds three 460 calorie large servings or six 230 calorie small servings. We based our estimates in the table above on one person consuming 3 large yogurt servings (or 6 small) per week. But if you love yogurt like we do, you might consume twice that amount!</p>

</h3></div>
<div>What is Triple Cream yogurt? Simply, yogurt with triple the milkfat of regular whole milk yogurts. Typical whole milk Greek yogurts have about 5% milkfat. Ours has 18%, over three times more! It's out-of-this-world delicious and, we think, more nutritious.</div>
<p><i><b>Simple, Real Yogurt</b></i><br/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447047495/iok1wlgly7uo2v0rnkx8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We only use organic dairy and live yogurt cultures. No thickeners, gums, preservatives, added sweeteners, or other junk.</p>
<p><i><b>Organic Dairy Means Grassfed &amp; Pastured Cows</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443916767/arnt0gqrkmkzbg5k9mix.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Organic dairy cows are required by law to get at least one-third of their food from grazing on pasture during the growing season. Fresh grazed grass in the cows' diet is essential for creating the rich, nutrient-dense cream we're so proud to make our yogurt with. Organic dairy also does not use GMO feed, antibiotics, or growth hormones.</p>

<p><i>What is Milk Protein Concentrate?</i> All Greek yogurts are concentrated by either centrifugation (a spinning bowl, basically) or filtration systems. Because we've partnered with a small creamery who doesn't have this equipment (and it's quite expensive to purchase!), we're instead using pre-concentrated milk blended with cream and whole milk to create our Triple Cream greek yogurts. Milk protein concentrate is a form of concentrated milk that is very low in lactose. One advantage of using pre-concentrated milk is that <i>our process generates no acid whey</i>--a byproduct which has been a major environmental challenge for other Greek yogurt makers.</p>

<h3><b>Why make Triple Cream Yogurt and eat more milkfat?</b></h3>
<h4><b>Three words: Energy, Nutrition, Deliciousness</b></h4>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Safe Energy<br/>
</h3>
<p>Dairy fat is clean-burning and won't spike your blood sugar, so it's a great energy source for those looking for an alternative to carb- and sugar-rich foods. It's very low in Omega-6 polyunsaturated fat, so it won't contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation in your body (unlike soy, canola, corn, and most other vegetable oils).</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Amazing Nutrients<br/>
</h3>
<p>Milkfat is rich in incredibly healthful nutrients that are hard to find elsewhere. Here are our top three:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Milkfat is rich in Vitamin K2</b>, a crucial nutrient that few have heard of and most don't get enough of. <i>K2 prevents calcification of your arteries, supports bone and dental health, and is critical for avoiding heart disease and osteoporosis.</i> Dairy fat is one of the few common sources of Vitamin K2--especially when the cows eat fresh green grass!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Milkfat is the single best source of butyrate</b>, a short chain fatty acid with many health benefits, which include support of <i>digestive health and anti-inflammatory properties</i>. (Vegetables are healthy largely because their soluble fiber is converted to butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids by beneficial gut bacteria.)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Milk fat is an excellent source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)</b>, which has anti-cancer properties and may help with weight loss.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Deliciousness<br/>
</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447057455/l4tpijiwjxj8mrbtvoch.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p></div>
<div>Most Greek yogurts are chalky and pasty--but not ours. Because our Greek yogurt has more milkfat than others, it has a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel.</div>

<p>Most other yogurts contain 35-55% of calories as added sugar - no better than other junk foods. </p>

<h2>Worried About Saturated Fat?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Milkfat, found in cream and butter, is high in saturated fat, so it was long demonized by health authorities who recommended avoidance.<br/>
</p>
<p>But the crusade against saturated fat was based on bad science, unscrupulous media, and political special interest groups.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the truth about dairy fat's healthfulness and nutrition is getting out.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A 2010 scientific review of epidemiological studies</a> concluded ""there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of [heart disease or stroke].""</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0063835/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Another large review study from 2014</a>, which included randomized controlled trials, the ""gold standard"" of diet studies, concluded ""evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.""</p>
<p>Thankfully, the press is catching on, too. The best evidence? The June 12, 2014 cover of time magazine: <i>""Eat Butter. Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong."" </i></p>
<p></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443115981/qsdpwcxtzfilcgbtqd6b.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 276.247px; height: 367px;""/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Four powerful lines of evidence allow us to dismiss any fear of saturated fats:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Humans have been eating saturated fats for hundreds of millennia. Why blame modern diseases, like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, on a nutrient found in ancient foods? It just doesn't make sense.<br/>
</li>
<li>High-quality observational studies find no association between dietary saturated fat intake and heart disease, the ailment for which saturated fat is most commonly blamed.<br/>
</li>
<li>There are many examples of societies that consume ample saturated fat, yet enjoy robust health. For example, the French consume almost double the saturated fat of Americans, yet die only about half as often from cardiovascular heart disease. <br/>
</li>
<li>Randomized Controlled Trials completely fail to implicate saturated fat (or total fat) as a cause of disease. This type of clinical trial is considered the ""Gold Standard"" of scientific studies on human health because they isolate a single variable and control for interfering factors. There have been over a dozen of these studies that examine saturated fat. Not a single one of these studies showed that a reduction in saturated fat alone was beneficial.<br/>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h2>
<p>We've worked hard to mitigate the risks and chart a path to success. Still, any project like this has some unavoidable risk. Some worth mentioning:<br/>
</p>
<ul> <li>Our first batch of commercial yogurt may not be perfect. Yogurt production at a real commercial creamery is a bit different than handmade yogurt in a home kitchen. We'll de-risk and prep to the extent we can, but our first batch or two may not exactly match our homemade stuff. </li>
<li>Yogurt batches can fail due to contamination, poor quality, or other reasons. This would increase our startup costs and could cause delays.</li>
<li>Supply and price of organic milk and cream could present challenges.</li> <li>Working with co-manufacturers entails certain difficulties and risks.</li> </ul>

With 100% Organic Dairy from Grassfed Cows



Peak Yogurt makes the first Triple Cream yogurts using just organic dairy and live active culture. With triple the milkfat of regular whole milk yogurts, it's the bold and delicious alternative to sugar-filled nonfat yogurts.
This campaign will fund the launch of our first product: A Greek-style yogurt with 18% milkfat made here in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Yogurt Pre-Orders

How It Works

If you live in our Northern California delivery area or near one of our five pickup locations, you can be one of the first to experience our yogurt by pre-ordering through this campaign.
Follow these steps to select the right yogurt pre-order perk:
1. Select your perk size - Small, Medium, or Large



The shelf life of our product is at least 40 days (about 6 weeks). Each 24-oz container holds three 460 calorie large servings or six 230 calorie small servings. We based our estimates in the table above on one person consuming 3 large yogurt servings (or 6 small) per week. But if you love yogurt like we do, you might consume twice that amount!
2. Select Pickup or Delivery




We'll deliver anywhere in the nine Bay Area counties, plus Sacramento, Santa Cruz, and Yolo Counties. Or you can pick up your yogurt at one of five locations in California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington state. We'll have at least three pick up dates for each location (exact dates and location address to be determined).
3. Select your perk!
Select the right perk for you and complete Indiegogo checkout process.
Not in the pickup or delivery areas?
Why not gift your pre-order to a friend who is? Or make a donation of your yogurt! Just select one of our Pickup perks and let us know that you'd like your pre-order to support a charitable donation. We're always here at hello@peakyogurt.com.

Our Product







Triple Cream Greek Yogurt with 18% Milkfat

What is Triple Cream yogurt? Simply, yogurt with triple the milkfat of regular whole milk yogurts. Typical whole milk Greek yogurts have about 5% milkfat. Ours has 18%, over three times more! It's out-of-this-world delicious and, we think, more nutritious.
Simple, Real Yogurt


We only use organic dairy and live yogurt cultures. No thickeners, gums, preservatives, added sweeteners, or other junk.
Organic Dairy Means Grassfed & Pastured Cows


Organic dairy cows are required by law to get at least one-third of their food from grazing on pasture during the growing season. Fresh grazed grass in the cows' diet is essential for creating the rich, nutrient-dense cream we're so proud to make our yogurt with. Organic dairy also does not use GMO feed, antibiotics, or growth hormones.

Nutrition and Ingredients



What is Milk Protein Concentrate? All Greek yogurts are concentrated by either centrifugation (a spinning bowl, basically) or filtration systems. Because we've partnered with a small creamery who doesn't have this equipment (and it's quite expensive to purchase!), we're instead using pre-concentrated milk blended with cream and whole milk to create our Triple Cream greek yogurts. Milk protein concentrate is a form of concentrated milk that is very low in lactose. One advantage of using pre-concentrated milk is that our process generates no acid whey--a byproduct which has been a major environmental challenge for other Greek yogurt makers.
Macronutrients - Fat/Protein/Carbs
Here are the approximate macros (% of total calories) for our 18% milkfat Greek yogurt:





With 82% calories from fat, this is first and only ketogenic yogurt to be sold in the United States.


Cream

Milkfat from Grassfed Cows is a Superfood





Why make Triple Cream Yogurt and eat more milkfat?
Three words: Energy, Nutrition, Deliciousness
Safe Energy

Dairy fat is clean-burning and won't spike your blood sugar, so it's a great energy source for those looking for an alternative to carb- and sugar-rich foods. It's very low in Omega-6 polyunsaturated fat, so it won't contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation in your body (unlike soy, canola, corn, and most other vegetable oils).
Amazing Nutrients

Milkfat is rich in incredibly healthful nutrients that are hard to find elsewhere. Here are our top three:




Milkfat is rich in Vitamin K2, a crucial nutrient that few have heard of and most don't get enough of. K2 prevents calcification of your arteries, supports bone and dental health, and is critical for avoiding heart disease and osteoporosis. Dairy fat is one of the few common sources of Vitamin K2--especially when the cows eat fresh green grass!


Milkfat is the single best source of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid with many health benefits, which include support of digestive health and anti-inflammatory properties. (Vegetables are healthy largely because their soluble fiber is converted to butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids by beneficial gut bacteria.)


Milk fat is an excellent source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has anti-cancer properties and may help with weight loss.



Deliciousness


Most Greek yogurts are chalky and pasty--but not ours. Because our Greek yogurt has more milkfat than others, it has a smooth and luxurious mouthfeel.

“Fat gives things flavor” -Julia Child
Help Us End the Tyranny of Sugar-Filled Junk Food Yogurts!



Most other yogurts contain 35-55% of calories as added sugar - no better than other junk foods. 
Our solution is the first proudly high-fat unsweetened yogurt.



What Our Fans Are Saying



""This yogurt tastes AMAZING. High in fat and non-existent in carbohydrates is a real kicker for me!”
Sami Inkinen, Ironman and triathlon world champion, co-founder of Trulia, Fat Chance Row





“You can’t even compare the taste of this yogurt to that of the brands in the stores, it’s that good! Not to mention, after a scoop you’re totally satisfied.”
Meredith Loring, co-founder of Native Life Foods, Fat Chance Row



“You think you’ve had yogurt, but this is something different. It brings creamy to a whole new level. It’s so delicious—I can’t recommend it enough!”
Kyra Davis, Director, LaunchPad Central Academic





“It’s hard to find convenient high-fat snacks. That’s why I was so excited to discover Peak Yogurt’s high-fat Greek yogurt. I love that it uses high-quality ingredients, without preservatives or sugary mix-ins.”
Niels Hoven, VP of Product Development at Pocket Gems


“The flavor and texture of Peak Yogurt is like nothing I’ve ever had. It’s the first yogurt that I find myself going back for seconds and thirds every time.”
Analisa Schelle, Sr VP at a PR firm




Worried About Saturated Fat?

Milkfat, found in cream and butter, is high in saturated fat, so it was long demonized by health authorities who recommended avoidance.

But the crusade against saturated fat was based on bad science, unscrupulous media, and political special interest groups.
Thankfully, the truth about dairy fat's healthfulness and nutrition is getting out.
A 2010 scientific review of epidemiological studies concluded ""there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of [heart disease or stroke].""
Another large review study from 2014, which included randomized controlled trials, the ""gold standard"" of diet studies, concluded ""evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats.""
Thankfully, the press is catching on, too. The best evidence? The June 12, 2014 cover of time magazine: ""Eat Butter. Scientists labeled fat the enemy. Why they were wrong."" 





Four powerful lines of evidence allow us to dismiss any fear of saturated fats:



Humans have been eating saturated fats for hundreds of millennia. Why blame modern diseases, like heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, on a nutrient found in ancient foods? It just doesn't make sense.

High-quality observational studies find no association between dietary saturated fat intake and heart disease, the ailment for which saturated fat is most commonly blamed.

There are many examples of societies that consume ample saturated fat, yet enjoy robust health. For example, the French consume almost double the saturated fat of Americans, yet die only about half as often from cardiovascular heart disease. 

Randomized Controlled Trials completely fail to implicate saturated fat (or total fat) as a cause of disease. This type of clinical trial is considered the ""Gold Standard"" of scientific studies on human health because they isolate a single variable and control for interfering factors. There have been over a dozen of these studies that examine saturated fat. Not a single one of these studies showed that a reduction in saturated fat alone was beneficial.




What We Need
What the funds will support:




$5k Product development and scale-up work at The University of Madison, Wisconsin, where we test and perfect the manufacturing process on a smaller version of the actual commercial equipment.

$10k Our first two commercial batches of yogurt.


Team



Evan Sims - Founder & Chief Yogurt Maker
Rock climber, scientist, & engineer. Worked in biotech for 4.5 y before starting Peak Yogurt in 2014.
Say hello: @EvanSims_

Advisors: We have a great team of four advisors with experience in consumer packaged goods, dairy, food science, entrepreneurship, marketing, and business development.




What We've Accomplished So Far


We've developed a great formula and are ready for scale-up: We've made over 100 home test batches using commercial yogurt culture, including batches meant to mimic our real commercial manufacturing process.


We've held tasting events and sampled to hundreds of people across the Bay Area. We learned a ton from getting out and sampling our product to people in real life. We tweaked and perfected our recipe based on the feedback and built a strong local fan base in the process.



We've attracted strong interest from local grocers. Here are a few of the Bay Area grocery stores we've connected with:


We've partnered with a local creamery to produce our yogurt: We've partnered with Pavel's Yogurt, in San Leandro, CA, for commercial yogurt manufacture.
We have access to a secure supply of organic milk & cream: Pavel's, our production partner, has a longstanding relationship with Clover Stornetta, our favorite Bay Area organic dairy, so we have access to a great supply of organic milk and cream.


Risks & Challenges

We've worked hard to mitigate the risks and chart a path to success. Still, any project like this has some unavoidable risk. Some worth mentioning:

 Our first batch of commercial yogurt may not be perfect. Yogurt production at a real commercial creamery is a bit different than handmade yogurt in a home kitchen. We'll de-risk and prep to the extent we can, but our first batch or two may not exactly match our homemade stuff. 
Yogurt batches can fail due to contamination, poor quality, or other reasons. This would increase our startup costs and could cause delays.
Supply and price of organic milk and cream could present challenges. Working with co-manufacturers entails certain difficulties and risks.

<div>We are Mothers to teenage son's with autism. One of our biggest fears has always been, ""What would happen to our boys if something happened to us"" We had to do something that would give law enforcement and first responders a tool to help our boys if we were injured and unable to speak on their behalf. Do you have those worries, or know someone that does? Whether its Autism or Diabetes, Alzheimers or any other medical condition or disability, our A.S.A.P. kit can provide you peace of mind and help first responders help you or your loved one.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goal is to raise $25,000!</p>
<p>We aim to have our Alert for Special Assistance Program recognized nationwide. One universal system that is the same in every state. So if you travel from where you live to somewhere across the country, and an emergency happens, law enforcement and first responders will still know how to help you in the best way possible. We are at the tip of our marketing campaign, and taking this across the country is a huge endeavor, but we are not stopping until it happens. To date we have received enormous support for our project and our goal. A.S.A.P was sent state wide to all 99 county Sheriff's Department's in Iowa last week. State Police and City Police Chiefs are sharing the details with their forces and incorporating A.S.A.P. into their training! How amazing is that!! We continue to send samples and brochures to law enforcement and EMS, with your help we can reach across the country even faster. Sending all our information to thousands of agencies across the country adds up, as well as printing thousands of brochures and completed A.S.A.P. kits. We have so much to accomplish in the next few months, with your help we can do it! Join us to make A.S.A.P. Alert for Special Assistance Program known in every town, city and rural community across the country. When ever you see it on the road, you'll be able to say..."" I helped make that happen!""</p>
<p>Our perks include complete kits that you can use for yourself or even contribute so you can help a friend or family member that struggles with a disability or disease. You will also be helping us get the information to law enforcement and first responders across the country. Not only are you helping yourself or a loved one, but will also be helping make the job of law enforcement and first responders a little easier. You could also be recognized on our website as someone who helped make this possible!</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal, we can still do great things with the funds we do raise, we can still get the message out to as many areas as possible. Even if we only reach half of the U.S.A. that means we are half way there! Thats progress!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The peace of mind our product can make to someone is priceless. We feel it, because we live it.... Knowing that those urgent pieces of information are with us and our children every day takes a great burdon off our shoulders. We know that our boys will be taken care of in the best possible way, and that is a blessing to us. Raising children with disabilities changes everything about who you think you are, and you become someone you never thought you could be. We want to be a part of giving people with medical needs and special needs, and their caretakers a little less to worry about.</p>
<p>We give back to our community by organizing a Special Needs Easter Egg Hunt every year, and we love it. We like being a part of something bigger than us, when we started that event 8 years ago we had a small field full of eggs, 8 years later we get donations from people as far away as California and nationally recognized organizations donate and help in the field. Our small field full of eggs became a huge field full of eggs and prizes galore. So we know how something can grow if you put your heart into it!</p>
<p>This came to life when I was almost hit by another driver on the highway while I had my autistic son with me. It was a very close call and by Gods grace we managed to avoid that oncoming car. Here at K2 Medical Alerts we began to talk about what we could do to help in the event of something like that happening. How we could help our families, other families, law enforcement and first responders. Thinking about how afraid our children would be broke our hearts. My son is non-verbal, so he'd not even be able to communicate his name or who to call in case of emergencies. Now with A.S.A.P. on our vehicles, those who need to know, will know, and words can't describe how uplifting that feels for us. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We understand there will be challenges, but we face challenges every day. When you strive to do something that will make a difference in peoples lives, every challenge and risk is worth it. It may take us months to get our program across the country but we are dedicated. So far we have had nothing but positive feedback and support and we will continue to pursue that. There is no reward without risk, and no excitement without challenge! </p>
<p>Everyday we watch our children take risks and battle the challenges, what they have to deal with just to get through a day is enormous sometimes. They have taught us a great deal about life, character, dedication and love. Our company lives by those things.

For example, South Carolina has alarmingly high rates of high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and Type II Diabetes. The state also ranks first in lower limb amputations from Diabetes! One of the major risk factors for each of these serious health conditions is obesity.</p>
<p>Children in America currently face having shorter life expectancies than their parents due this every growing epidemic. In fact, two of every five (39.1%) children in South Carolina are either overweight or obese. These life-threatening combinations are even more exaggerated in the areas of our community that have a lower socioeconomic status. Implementing health and wellness programs have the potential to make enormous impacts on the health of our community, but would also positively impact our economy in South Carolina.

<p><strong><em>Be Your Own Champion</em></strong> is a health and wellness program created and designed by HopeHealth, Inc., a nonprofit federally qualified health center that services the Pee Dee region and parts of eastern South Carolina. The goal of HopeHealth’s <em>Be Your Own Champion</em> program is to empower patients suffering from chronic and acute illnesses to change their health behaviors. As a result, this program can help improve health outcomes related to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and Type II Diabetes through the fusing of wellness, exercise and conventional health care. Participants (Champions) of <em>Be Your Own Champion</em> will be enrolled into a twelve month program that consists of being monitored by a physician and being referred to a partnering wellness center. The physician, the Champion and the wellness center work closely together to tailor the program specifically to the needs of each Champion. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, statistics show a correlation between low socioeconomic status and chronic disease.

This funding platform allows you to become a <strong>""Wellness Angel""</strong> by sponsoring a scholarship for a Champion who otherwise would be unable to participate.

For example, South Carolina has alarmingly high rates of high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and Type II Diabetes. The state also ranks first in lower limb amputations from Diabetes! One of the major risk factors for each of these serious health conditions is obesity.
Children in America currently face having shorter life expectancies than their parents due this every growing epidemic. In fact, two of every five (39.1%) children in South Carolina are either overweight or obese. These life-threatening combinations are even more exaggerated in the areas of our community that have a lower socioeconomic status. Implementing health and wellness programs have the potential to make enormous impacts on the health of our community, but would also positively impact our economy in South Carolina.

</h3>
<p>This July marks a tremendous shift in my
narrative—a physical and metaphysical crossing over from one body into another
and from one lifestyle to a new one. After a long awaited life altering surgery
my month long recovery blurs into the start of my career as a high school
English teacher. As my body shifts into the androgyny I most intimately
identify with my family will transition (finally) into the first secure rung of
middle class that for too long felt unreachable. Though I won’t be rolling in
it, I will have a stable income and real healthcare. Unfortunately, this long
awaited benefit does not come with the coverage for top surgery. I, however, am
determined to begin this new version of my life in the gender expression that
is truest for me. </p>
<p>Becoming outwardly the self I’ve always known to
be inwardly feels like the sensation you get when you thought for sure you were
wrong, or for sure you failed the test, and suddenly find out that actually you
were right and you aced the test after all. Do you know that feeling? It’s the
closest simile I’ve got for you. </p>
<p>In order to support my family (my two amazing
kiddos) through this transition, both financially and emotionally, I am seeking
the help of my near and far community. As part of this process I am holding an
epic salon café at my home in Portland, Oregon where I’ll be reading from my
self-published book, <i>Both/Neither: a
poemior unchests</i>.  These poems,
essays, and vignettes have unraveled from me over the course of the last 12
years.</p>
<p>This campaign provides a space for locals to buy
entry tickets to the salon café and for those of you dear and far to
pre-purchase the book and/or support my transition through donations that award
other goodies. </p>
<p>Any money that I make above the cost of my surgery
($7500) will go to a scholarship fund (handled by the lovely folks of Pervert
the Cirque) for future folks seeking support with their trans related medical
needs. </p>

<p>I have a hard time making a fixed statement about
anything. [Even gender] I’m not one</p>
<p>to get fully on any wagon though I am good at
getting going. [I fidget and collage] Perhaps </p>
<p>this roots up out of not having </p>
<p>a box to check on forms of existence, application,
permission. </p>
<p>I can’t even choose a genre. [I mean gender] Texts
out of me won’t just </p>
<p>poem themselves. My textuality takes a little </p>
<p>from over here and up there or back then. I can
only hope </p>
<p>readers dissipate stiff edges [mine holdfast and
push and shove] </p>
<p>get limber in my versions. Let me try to say it </p>
<p>like so. I write [I mean blur] poemoirs, </p>
<p>wrestle language and grammar, truth and fiction,
into pluralities. [Everything genders] </p>
<p>A maker of questions, I write to go, [I mean fuck]
</p>
<p>to experience disembodiment, to expand a universe
or two. [My own type of] </p>
<p>Dispelling any notion that language is enough to
make with.</p>
<p>//</p>
<p>I
don’t end neatly in my skin or ink, but I work at it, work with large objects
and slippery cairns found at random while walking about, this is just how
dreaming happens once the brain’s assured there’s no danger, didn’t you know,
sleep is dangerous, mallards and dolphins and even lizards know and metallica
too, singing the kingdom out of their masterful chests, while I write my way
back, back into a shape I can recognize and name, O, all too often I am left
speechless and winging my way, khrg, I promised myself I’d make a statement
already, how hard can it be, isn’t this how genders become a period </p>
<p>///</p>
<p>Does
the period make the statement or the statement the period? </p>
<p>Text is another noun for body. When the body is
wrong, revise it.</p>
<p>My
body, my text. My transtextuality. </p>
<p>Won’t
you read, O please, me either way? </p>
<p>////</p>
<p>If it
is with language that we find each other, name what cannot be explained or
question what is supposedly certain, than absolutely it is through language
that we work to overcome what is mangled in us, in each other, in the world. </p>
<p>Our
alphabet weighs paperthin-weight. No, we cannot fatten properly on word alone. Why certain truths make a stillbirth. This biting desire to write then
must be a form of natural selection. The stickiest cells keeping time keep
touching each other. Well,
Jack, this is my ode to you. </p>

drop your pants with, maybe another to pull your calvin’s down. “Come on, show
me.” You first. “No, you.” Pause.
“What’er you fraid?” Am not. You are.
Dummy.

[Oh child, yes am frayed.]
*The following poem was first published in the
anthology Troubling the Line: Trans &
Genderqueer Poetry and Poetics:
Poetics Statement for the Undeclared
/
I have a hard time making a fixed statement about
anything. [Even gender] I’m not one
to get fully on any wagon though I am good at
getting going. [I fidget and collage] Perhaps 
this roots up out of not having 
a box to check on forms of existence, application,
permission. 
I can’t even choose a genre. [I mean gender] Texts
out of me won’t just 
poem themselves. My textuality takes a little 
from over here and up there or back then. I can
only hope 
readers dissipate stiff edges [mine holdfast and
push and shove] 
get limber in my versions. Let me try to say it 
like so. I write [I mean blur] poemoirs, 
wrestle language and grammar, truth and fiction,
into pluralities. [Everything genders] 
A maker of questions, I write to go, [I mean fuck]

to experience disembodiment, to expand a universe
or two. [My own type of] 
Dispelling any notion that language is enough to
make with.
//
I
don’t end neatly in my skin or ink, but I work at it, work with large objects
and slippery cairns found at random while walking about, this is just how
dreaming happens once the brain’s assured there’s no danger, didn’t you know,
sleep is dangerous, mallards and dolphins and even lizards know and metallica
too, singing the kingdom out of their masterful chests, while I write my way
back, back into a shape I can recognize and name, O, all too often I am left
speechless and winging my way, khrg, I promised myself I’d make a statement
already, how hard can it be, isn’t this how genders become a period 
///
Does
the period make the statement or the statement the period? 
Text is another noun for body. When the body is
wrong, revise it.
My
body, my text. My transtextuality. 
Won’t
you read, O please, me either way? 
////
If it
is with language that we find each other, name what cannot be explained or
question what is supposedly certain, than absolutely it is through language
that we work to overcome what is mangled in us, in each other, in the world. 
Our
alphabet weighs paperthin-weight. No, we cannot fatten properly on word alone. Why certain truths make a stillbirth. This biting desire to write then
must be a form of natural selection. The stickiest cells keeping time keep
touching each other. Well,
Jack, this is my ode to you. 
////
Let me ask how
does your body feel today. 

Am I my body or just feeling? 
I have no proof just my open palms. 
Only my sweat.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My father, John Hajj, was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 23 years old and had many health problems since, about 5 years ago we were so thrilled to hear that his medical conditions were stable (diabetes, clogged arterys, etc.), but unfortunately his stability was only temporary. My father fell 4 years ago on Christmas day from a heart attack, doctors told us that his kidneys stopped working and all the toxins were clogging his major arteries to his heart. In other words he had just barely dodged death. Since his kidneys failed he has been on dialysis 5 times a week, just recently his nurse who comes to the house to take care of him said,""You will be needing to do 6 days a week,"". Those of you who have family members in the house who are constantly on dialysis could understand the difficulties of it. My father had to stop working and that has left my mother all alone working to take care of 3 kids while they further their education. Unfortunately its been my fathers 4th Christmas on dialysis and all I ever see is him losing hope-- that he'll get a kidney. Those of you that know, dialysis is only a temporary fix and it will save his life meanwhile, until we find him a kidney. They estimated that in 15 years he will be eligible for a transplant, but doctor says that he can only be on the machine for 10 years considering his condition. My family has looked long and hard for my father to receive a kidney and we have found many relatives around the world willing to give their kidneys, problem is, we don't have the money to do it. My family cannot afford 60,000 dollars for the transplant. I am doing anything and everything in my power to get that money. Please help us out if you can, I understand the difficulties in the economy and I promise every single dollar can make a difference. </div><div>

<h3><strong>Imagine having to live with a constant worry that at any time your heart will become infected, and there is nothing you can do about it. You wake up at 4 am every few weeks with your mouth swollen and throbbing, blistered and infected. You have no dental coverage so you do the only thing you can: go to Urgent care for antibiotics that only partially work and cause major digestive issues. The staff wonders if you're a meth addict due to the condition of your teeth. You've never even smoked a cigarette. They ask why you don't just get them fixed, and they tell you are in very real danger. This is my life.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Due to having Systemic Lupus, a chronic and not yet curable autoimmune disease, my teeth have all but disintegrated.  SLE causes saliva and tear glands to stop working, chronic vomiting, kidney and bladder issues, skin lesions, joint pain and detioration, and nerve/neurological failures. The disease has also damaged my heart valve, and we are trying to put surgery for that out as long as we can. However, because I have constant oral infections the risk of bacteria infecting my heart is very high and getting worse. I'm basically a ticking time bomb.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>How did Health Movement start?</strong></p>
<p>Rich decided to quit his job in health care administration to start HEALTH MOVEMENT because he could no longer stomach trying to “fix” patients after they were already “broken.” Rich has a degree in nutrition and a master’s in public health and knew the research showed that by simply changing one’s LIFESTYLE we can eliminate 80% of all heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, and more than 40% of all cancer cases. <strong>How incredible is that?!  Something needed to be done!</strong> There must be a better way to help each other reach our health goals, avoid disease and live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Rich’s passion is health!</strong> And that’s the driving force behind this concept.  No “quick-fix” promises trying to sell a pill or drink that doesn’t really work but would make a ton of money.  Easy to do, and done every day – but we all know there are no “quick-fixes.”  Rich wants to do something different.  He has built a company around a central vision, creed, and manifesto that’s real, that’s honest, that truly works, that may not be what people want to hear but is the truth.  A company people can trust for honest information - free and helpful tools based on sound research - bringing people together behind a simple goal - HEALTH MOVEMENT was born.</p>
<p>Currently, the Health Movement team is made up of Rich, Kelly (a friend and grad school classmate of Rich’s) and a few college interns.</p>
<p><strong>Who is this Movement for?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Into cross-fit or yoga, walking or biking, dancing or swimming, or still searching for what you like…this movement is for you!  </li>
<li>Fighting cancer, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, or obesity…this movement is for you!</li>
<li>Tall, short, thick, thin, round or square…this movement is for you.</li>
<li>Vegetarian, gluten-intolerant, a meat-loving carnivore or love or hate chocolate…this movement is for you!</li>
<li>Trying to lose weight, train for a marathon or just have more energy…this movement is for you!</li>
</ul>
<p>Because good health is one thing we all want and one thing we can all agree on regardless of our unique preferences - this is about healthy living—YOUR way - whatever YOUR way or reason is. We want to help you get there, but this is a problem too great for any one of us to try and solve alone.   We know there is strength in numbers, we have to work together, improve together, succeed, stumble and keep going together.  We are in this HEALTH MOVEMENT together!</p>

<p>It's a fact, when people feel good, they do good. They are more productive at work. They smile more and are able to enjoy life to the fullest. That is a HUGE impact - not only to our community, but the world.</p>
<p>Hi, I am Dr. Malori Tinsley. I have an immense amount of passion to help people not only feel better, but function at their most optimal level.</p>
<p>My love for Chiropractic Applied Kinesiology (CAK) started about 20 years ago when I became a patient. I have reaped so many benefits from this type of care, that I want to share my knowledge and passion with others, like yourself!</p>
<p>I have seen firsthand, the impact that CAK along with nutrition and movement therapy has had on my patients lives. Even my very own Fathers life was and is forever changed.....more on that later.</p>
<p>Don't you want to make a difference in your life? Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired? Are you ready to make a change? Are you ready to really make an impact in your life? To not only feel good, but reach your most optimal potential.</p>
<p>Imagine that for a second. Imagine what it would be like if your body reached it's most optimal function. How would your life be different? You would sleep better, your family would be happier, your jeans would fit just right, and you would finally live your life to the fullest.</p>
<p>Your bucket list is finally getting checked off. Starting with optimal health. Because without health, you won't be able to enjoy all those amazing adventures on your bucket list.</p>
<p> Make this year full of passion, full of vitality, full of health! Make this year, your best year YET. Don't just make another boring resolution, <strong>make an impact</strong>.</p>

<p>Applied Kinesiology uses manual muscle testing to asses the state of body's overall health. <strong>Applied Kinesiology Manual Muscle Testing (AK MMT) interprets brain function</strong> - since the brain controls everything - it is important to know how it is functioning. Furthermore, AK also determines the health of each organ system in your body<strong>. Muscles are connected  to every single system in the body</strong> - the respiratory system, digestive system, reproductive system, circulatory system, lymphatic system - every single system. Muscles are organs, and organs communicate with one another. Therefore, we can use muscle tests to find which system is in dysfunction that is causing you to feel pain or hinder function. For example, if you are experiencing low back pain, a regular chiropractor will locate the dysfunction in the low back as there is most often a misalignment in the vertebrae of the low back.  <strong>AK can uncover where the core problem lies,</strong> giving you a deeper diagnosis or explanation. Whether the problem lies in your digestive tract or lymphatic blockage - Using A.K. to find missing piece will allow your body to heal quicker and respond faster to treatment, because we will be able to treat the actual problem, not just the symptom.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for a disease to manifest, Functional Medicine catches it early on and offers dietary and supplemental support to allow <strong>your body to function at its most optimum.</strong> At Well Balanced Body we are able to order you a full blood work panel at a <strong>more affordable price</strong> than it would cost you to order it through your regular Doctor. Plus unlike other practitioners, Dr. Tinsley takes the time to really <strong>analyze your findings</strong>, write you a <strong>detailed report</strong>, and offer you a <strong>specific plan</strong> to help you <strong>be well and stay well.</strong> When we really know and understand what is going on in our body, we are able to take action!<br/> </p>
<p><strong>3. Movement Therapy:  </strong></p>
<p>Movement therapy is the KEY to optimal function. When you first come into an appointment, you have all these movement restrictions. Based on old injuries - your brain creates compensational pathways in the brain. That means you literally move differently and restrict motion into those joints - the muscles tighten - and pretty soon ""old age"" is just an excuse to why you can't move the way you used to. <strong>Movement therapy helps rewire your brain</strong> into a more healthy movement pattern. Therefore your body can gain and maintain optimal function.</p>
<p><strong>4. Yoga:  </strong></p>
<p>Once you are able to move correctly, we offer yoga to keep you moving!  Yoga is one of Dr. Tinsleys passions, she prescribes it to her patients as a wonderful adjunct to her care. And Vice versa, a seasoned yogi can really benefit from Dr. Tinsley's care, because everyBODY deserves to reach optimal function. We encourage those to <strong>get their flow on</strong> - to experience how their body can move - and therefore can start doing activities that they love better!</p>
<p><strong>5. Workshops:</strong></p>
<p>We offer 1x/month workshops to help engage the community to get their healthiest. Our workshops are educational and are taught on different areas of health.  Without knowledge of health, we don't know how and why to get healthy. Here are Well Balanced Body, we believe that <strong>education is the catalyst for change.</strong></p>

<p>""I visited Dr. Tinsley after trying many different practitioners for a <strong>collapsed arch</strong> with other related pain and flexibility issues.  The treatment she implemented with a lot of <strong>hands on</strong> manipulations relieved the pain which I had been enduring for over 7 years.  Follow up treatments with the regimen of <strong>daily exercises</strong> has been e<strong>ffective and lasting for over a year..</strong>  Surgery was not an option I wished to pursue although it had been recommended by others.  There were certainly a few other areas that Dr. Tinsley was very effective in correcting and relieving pain but most of all<strong> she worked at the entire body not just the original foot issue.</strong>   She was truly a unique in my experience in that there was follow up contact to see if the treatments were continuing to be effective.   I do not hesitate recommending her for Chiropractic care certainly a great choice.<br/>-Rod A.<br/><br/>Dr. Tinsley provided chiropractic care that yielded <strong>immediate and long-lasting relief for shoulder, neck, and ankle discomfort.  </strong>She is knowledgeable and provided a level of care that will be difficult to replace.  Dr. Tinsley is conscientious and cares for her patients’ total well being. <br/>-Sharon M.<br/><br/> ""Dr. Malori Tinsley helped 3 of our family members with <strong>headache, neck, and other chiropractic issues. </strong>She a<strong>ddresses your diet and nutrition, and provides beneficial exercises</strong> to deal with whatever issue or pain that is causing trouble.""<br/>-The Medcalf family<br/><br/>My ears started hurting really bad in October/November of 2011. It was an almost constant intense pain that felt like something sharp and hot or cold was being stuck deep into my ear. I could not listen to music anymore, or play the piano, no more movies and certainly no parties or large groups of people. Cold air caused  more pain as well as any metallic sounds or the tinkling of glassware. I spent most of my time in my room in complete silence, often with a pillow over my head. The only thing that really helped was heat and silence. Even taking something like Advil or Aleve did not help much or for long. I did not know why this was happening, and all my doctors were saying that it was Trigeminal Neuralgia and that I would have to live with the pain for the rest of my life. This is not what a 20 year old wants to hear. Especially one who loves playing or listening music as much as I do. A friend of mine suggested that maybe a chiropractor could help, as something might be out in my neck that could be causing all of this. I went to a chiropractor a few times, but nothing really happened except the pain got worse. As the months went by I turned into a recluse, I never went anywhere, never did anything. The pain kept getting worse until I could not sleep at night because of it, even people talking to me made it hurt more. It started moving into my face, right along my cheekbones, and the right side was always the worst. I could not go outside in the cold without something covering my ears and face from the bridge of my nose down. Finally in August 2012, I saw Dr. Malori Tinsley. Dr. Tinsley knew within minutes what was wrong with me. Shortly before the pain started in the first place I had hit my head really hard. I did not remember this at first, but when I did I realized that it had hurt an awful lot but I had not had time to think much else about it when it happened. Dr. Tinsley told me that I had collapsed my sinuses and that this had caused blockage behind my ears, thus the pain. She told me a few things to do, gave me a new diet to try, and told me to come see here again. <strong>After that first visit I felt so much better</strong>. <strong>I was amazed at how much easier it was to do things without that constant pain in my ears. </strong>After a few months of visits every few weeks I was almost back to normal. I will forever be indebted to Dr. Tinsley, and I will never forget how she helped me. Thank you Dr. Tinsley, for everything.<br/>-Larissa<br/><br/>I went to Dr. Tinsley for full body chiropractic work, everything just felt out of place and I was having strange pains that would come and go in my ankle, knee, lower back and neck and shoulders. <strong>Dr. Tinsley was able to find the exact location of my pain and the correlating muscle and muscular/skeletal imbalance that was causing it!</strong><br/><br/>I found her so knowledgeable and incredibly caring, she really took A LOT of time to answer all of my questions. <strong>She was able to help me relax and release a lot of tightness and I felt so ""straight"" and aligned after the session, it was incredible</strong>.<br/><br/>She gave me 3 exercises to do that target my problem areas, my neck and jaw which are tight from stress and 60+hours a week at the desk, my shoulder blades which have become more and more rounded and my back and hips, which just needs help in general. I <strong>highly recommend her to anyone who is having ""mysterious"" pain/aches/cramps and just wants to feel good again!</strong><br/>-Anna T.<br/><br/>""I have never felt better; as I was treated for several months by Dr. Tinsley.I was treated for degenerative neck disease, a small fracture in my neck and arthritis. She has a lot of knowledge and really helped to keep me off the chemical drugs that mask the real problem. She used natural herbs and gave me lots of exercises to do which i still do. S<strong>he has a special way of working with you as she expains why, what to do and about how the body functions</strong>. Lots of different techniques are used to deal with different problems.""<br/>-Dana</p>
<h3><strong>Dr. Tinsley's Testimonial</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I am moved everyday by the positive health changes that occur in my patients lives. </strong>My passion to help people started at a very young age, when my Dad's live was forever changed....</p>
<p>When my Dad was about 40 years old, His heart would race uncontrollably, it became worrisome. He went from Doctor to Doctor trying to figure out the problem.  All his tests came back negative and they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. At the cardiologist office, the Doctor said, ""there is nothing wrong with you, but we suggest putting a pacemaker in your heart to control the issue."" This was very disheartening for our family. Our father had a perfect heart (according to the tests) and was in great shape. Wasn't there another answer? Luckily, my Aunt was attending Chiropractic College at the time and suggested that we get a second opinion by a Chiropractor Applied Kinesiologist in our area.</p>
<p>We took her advice and visited the Chiropractor. After careful examination, the Doctor found a <strong>chronic rib subluxation (rib out of place) in my Dad’s chest causing a lack of oxygen to his brain, therefore causing abnormal heart rhythm and speed, which is controlled by the brain. </strong>The Chiropractor told my Dad,<strong> ""I know what is wrong with you and I can fix it.""  </strong>What a relief!</p>
<p>And, he did just that. He corrected the problem by adjusting the rib back into it's normal position. Since that day, my Dad never had those heart symptoms again. His and our lives were forever changed.</p>
<p>From there on, Chiropractors have been my family’s go to for health questions, ailments, and just about anything. I remember my favorite day was our trip to the Chiropractor. Needless to say, they made me feel better and my body functioned better. They changed my diet. They listened to my concerns. They helped. They cared. And more importantly, they taught me about health.</p>

<p>Polychronis Tzortzakis is a National Greek Cycling Champion who races semi-professionally for a team in France. He is one of the many young Greeks who proudly wave the blue and white Greek flag, representing his nation wherever he races— despite being forced to live in France in order to pursuit his athletic goals.</p>
<p>Tzortzakis, a native of Hania on the island of Crete, hopes to race in Richmond Virginia at the Elite Road Cycling World Championship taking place on September 20-27, 2015.</p>
<p><b><i>He wants to represent Greece— and wear the blue and white Greek flag on his shirt.</i></b></p>
<p>But like all sporting institutions in the nation, the Greek Cycling Federation has huge budget shortfalls due to cuts in support and they don’t have the funds to send their National Champion to represent the country.</p>
<p>Polychronis reached out to me in a Facebook message— as have so many of Greece’s elite athletes, struggling to compete and represent their nation in these trying economic times.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I can win a medal but I will certainly race my best and hardest and gain a respectful result,” wrote the humble 26-year-old. “It’s important that the Greek flag is present on the race circuit at the World Championships. I really want to wear our flag and make our nation proud.”</p>
<p>Tzortzakis needs a paltry sum and wants to travel at bare minimum without the excesses enjoyed by other “National Champions”— another example of his humility. He needs about €2000 to €3000 for economy class flights to Washington DC, transport and hotel accommodations in Richmond, a minimal food budget and other related expenses including excess baggage costs for his bikes.</p>
<p>I have personally arranged this fund to help Polychronis and other elite Greek athletes get the recognition they deserve and compete on the global stage— whatever that stage might be, be it cycling, or in an arena, or on a track field.</p>

In fact, it’s about filling two needs. <br/><br/>As I’ve traveled in different parts of the world doing medical work, I’ve seen incredible need. In some places, doctors don’t have the basic instruments they need to take care of their own patients. So patients go without care. <br/><br/>I asked one of the ENT resident-doctors in Ethiopia if he had a car. He answered, “No, I don’t have money for a car. But if I did have money, I would not buy a car. I would buy surgical instruments.” He inspired me to find a way to help him buy them. And that solution is where the second need comes in. <br/><br/>While learning how to take care of patients in other parts of the world, something I’ve always known became much more obvious. Women are more challenged than men are when it comes to bathrooms. It’s a fact. And whether I’m in a remote part of the world or hiking in Northern Minnesota, I need to have a bathroom I can use comfortably. I got tired of packing a bunch of separate, bulky items every day, always prepared for the worst. I came up with the P-Kit to meet my own, and every woman’s need to have a predictable bathroom as we travel to out-of-the-way places.

I came up with the P-Kit to meet my own, and every woman’s need to have a predictable bathroom as we travel to out-of-the-way places. And when you buy a P-Kit, you are helping to provide sustainable care to patients.Learn more at P-Kit.org.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>From John’s wife;</strong></p>
<p>As a wife, it has been really hard to see my husband go through the degenerative process that is Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  We first met nearly 22 years ago, in the late summer of 1991, and we instantly fell in love.  John asked me to marry him two weeks later, and I said yes.   John was such a hard worker back then, but he already had some issues with his health.  He was on call 24/7 for his job, and he absolutely loved every minute of it.  He would work 16 hours, come home exhausted, then have to go out again in the middle of the night, but he never once complained.  When it comes to family, and people in general, John has always held fast to the ethics that his grandparents instilled in him as a child; you always help people, no matter what.  John helped anyone that was in need, and he never stopped helping people, even when he was sick.  When it came to family and friends, no matter how big or complicated the job, he would do everything that he could, to fulfill every request that he could, and he would do so without asking for, or accepting, any payment at all.  Over the years he slowly became a different person due to the constant pain and frequent injuries.  Where he was once so sweet, friendly and easy going, he was now becoming increasingly irritable, angry, and short tempered.  None of his doctors could explain what was causing all of these problems, and some questioned whether there actually were any, but that would all soon change.  When the day finally came in 1997 that John could no longer work due to his frequent injuries and the constant, unrelenting pain that he was in, we were both devastated.  John has a very specific view of what the terms husband and father mean, and without the ability to provide for his family, he felt that he was fulfilling neither.  In 1999 John was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3, and finally the questions that we had been asking for years were beginning to be answered.  Initially it was very difficult for both of us to deal with the finality of his diagnosis.  There were major implications now with regard to his lifespan, our daughter, and his various medications, not to mention the unknown variables.  The changes in his health and his way of life have been dramatic to say the least, and his constant decline has been as evident, as it has been upsetting, to everyone around him.  He is unable to eat most foods as they upset his stomach, so he tends to eat the same things day in and day out, sometimes for years at a time.  He doesn’t sleep well at all, and he has difficulty with his memory as well as with concentrating.  Some of his joints dislocate very easily, and he once went for more than a week with a dislocated right shoulder.  He has become very adept at hiding his pain from everyone, including myself.  John doesn’t like it when people worry about him, especially those of us that love him, so he hides his pain from everyone.  Sometimes he can’t hide it, and it upsets him to the point that he apologizes to us.  Even when he is suffering from the most agonizing pain, and suffering so badly that he can no longer hide it from us, he maintains an optimism that I honestly find frustrating at times.  He has a saying, and whenever someone asks him how he’s doing, or how much pain he is in, he always tries to reassure us that he’s ok by saying; “It could always be worse”.  We have been married for 19 years, and I continue to love him more and more, each and every day that we are together.  If I could have one wish, I would wish that he could be comfortable on a daily basis, and my main goal is to try to help him live a more comfortable life.  I believe that he deserves to be able to live his life to the fullest, and right now, in large part due to the medications that he is on, that is impossible.  He has effectively lost the last 15 ½ years of his life to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and I do not want that to continue.</p>

<p><strong><span>From John's daughter Katie;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Growing up my entire life I remember many things about my dad being sick.  Most, if not all, were hard to deal with, but some were downright unbearable.  Things such as hearing the whispers behind closed doors, the often tearful phone calls to my grandmother, and, on a few occasions, reading the ""goodbye"" notes that were left as my father went to the hospital for yet another surgery.  It has not only been hard on me, but it has been hard on my mother as well.  My parents always tried to put on a smile and tell me that everything was ""ok"", but as the years went by, and I continued to see the same, pained expression on my father’s face, it became more and more apparent that it was not ""ok"".  I was 3 ½ years old when the doctors diagnosed my dad with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.  He had already lost his ability to work by then, so my mom had to go to work just to keep us afloat.  Even though I don’t remember much from those early days, I do remember the days that followed.  I remember coming home from school every night and seeing him laying on the couch drenched in sweat, and I remember wishing that there was something that I could do or some comfort that I could give to him.  I remember the countless apologies from my dad because he felt that he had failed me as a father, and to this day I know that he wishes he could have given me the life that he wanted to give me.  It pains me to see him so upset, and to see him being so hard on himself all the time.  Growing up knowing that your father is in so much pain that he can’t even get out of bed, and that no matter what you do you can’t make him feel better, you can’t take away his pain, and you long for him to smile at you, is more difficult and more painful than you could imagine.</span></p>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">As a mother to discover your child has been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder, your life as you know it changes.You feel very helpless as you watch your child slowly deteriorate and endure unlimited amounts of pain, withdrawl and multiple surgeries.  I became trapped in a world of curiosity and disbelief as I learned more of John's condition. This connective tissue disorder stems from an inherited faulty collegen gene from our family.  It affects strength, elasticity of the muscles, skin, joints and major organs.  It also affects the blood vessels and can result in spontaneous arterial and intestinal rupture. It also can result in Aortic dissection ond other cardiac abnormalities, such as mitral valve  prolapse. Hypermobile joints with frequent dislocations are common. The skin becomes very fragile and stretchable that can easily bruise and tear.  There is severe musculosketetal pain and fatigue, along with delayed healing.  There can be neurological and/or spinal involvement. Cerebral arterial ruptures cause altered mental states and can be mistaken for drug overdose.  As this is an invisible illness, and since it is degenerative, the only hope I have for my son is for him to find some sort of a comfort zone and to have a reasonable quality of life.  He has made the choice of getting off all narcotic medications to try and gain the ablility to spend some quality time with his wife, daughter, family and friends. I support him in every endeavor and I am asking humbly for your support. </div>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""><strong>From John's best friend;</strong></div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">I've known John for about 10 years and I consider him to be my best friend. When I was first getting to know him I learned about his medical issues and the fentanyl patches he was on. John expressed concern that while on the patch he wasn't himself. He described that he often would see situations starting and felt like he was just witnessing the event without any control over what would happen. I understood what he was saying, but I did not really see what he meant until John began to reduce his medication. Over the months that followed I was able to meet a new John who I never had the pleasure of knowing fully before. To know someone for a decade and not know the real person because of the side effects of a medication was surprising. Right now, the withdrawal from getting off of the fentanyl patch has hit him pretty hard. He's able to hide it slightly from us and put on a happy face, but we can see what he is going through inside. This treatment will allow him to be free of this detrimental drug for good.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">John has always been a very compassionate man and regularly goes above and beyond to do anything he can for anyone in need. John gladly shares anything he has. Over the years he has rescued hundreds of animals and donated to many causes. He has helped friends, family, and acquaintances with guidance, understanding, and compassion, and been the most selfless person I know. He is the most deserving person I can imagine to receive assistance towards reaching his goal, and I'm looking forward to getting to know my best friend all over again!</div>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">""Almost 14 years ago I put a Fentanyl patch on my body for the first time, and as of today, at 2:30 pm I AM FINALLY FREE!!!  Since that first day, I have had a Fentanyl patch attached to my body every second of every day of that entire time.  It has been a nightmarishly brutal process, one that took 7 months to complete, but it is FINALLY OVER!  I started at a dose of 25 mcg/h, and by 2008 I was at 175 mcg/h, which is two patches (100 + 75) since the maximum single patch dose <span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">is 100 mcg/h.  I would have been on a much higher dose if I had allowed to doctors to increase it as they wished, but I'm kind of stubborn and I resisted.  I had been trying to find a non-narcotic alternative since early 2000, and I tried numerous experimental and alternative medications and therapies, but nothing really helped.  I kept pushing my doctors to find something else, and they kept asking me to bear with them and be patient, but early last year I decided that I had had enough.  I told them that I wanted to get off of the Fentany patch, but they didn't like the idea and asked for more time.  I waited a few more months, but in August I told them that I was done with Fentanyl and narcotics in general, and that I was going to start the process when my prescription was done in about a week.  They reluctantly agreed but wanted me to go at a slow pace, as they were worried about complications.  I decided to push the pace, and a little over a week later I made the first drop from 175 mcg/h to 150 mcg/h.  I continued to drop 25 mcg/h every 30 days, with each drop being incrementally higher by percentage.  As a result, it became more and more difficult and painful as time went on.  30 days ago I dropped from 25 mcg/h to 12 mcg/h, which is more than 50%, and the biggest drop until today which was 100%.  This has been an incredibly painful and exhausting process, and I'm sure that the elation that I'm feeling will soon be replaced with as of yet unrealised amounts of pain and withdrawl, but I know that it will all be worth it in the end.  Unfortunately this isn't truly the end of the process, as I still have to get off of the long acting synthetic morphine pills that I also take.  If I follow the schedule that my doctors recommend, it will take 17 months, but I'm going to do it in 5 months.  I want to thank everyone that has sent me their love and support during this difficult time, it means more to me than you will ever know.  To my wife Sherri Mathias , our daughter Katie Mathias, my mum Marian Hallewick and my best buddy Rob St John, I want to give an EXTRA SPECIAL THANK YOU!  Thank you so much for all of the love, compassion, understanding, caring, support and ABOVE ALL - PATIENCE that you have all shown me during this horrible ordeal since I know that it has been very hard for all of you as well.  I love you all so much, and I'm sure that I could never have done this without your help!  That being said, PLEASE don't give up on me just yet!  I still have a few months of hell to go through before I will truly be free, but once it's over it will be SO AMAZING!""</span>

<p><strong>THE PREMISE:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>The premise of <em>Indomitable</em> is simple. The primary care physician who fired me as a patient in 1995 said something I heard echoed repeatedly over the following twelve years, “There is nothing that can be done for your pain. <em>Y</em></span><span><em>ou need to learn to live with it</em></span><span><em>.</em>” When a physician, who is not interested in trying many options, runs out of options, “Learn to live with it"" is a knee-jerk reaction. The problem I have with the phrase “<em>learn to live with it</em>,” is there <strong>was</strong> an answer for me, and it was a medication available long before my accident. Because of the health care system, and the federal government’s mingling, I had to fight for over a decade to find the help I deserved. I lived in constant electroshock torture the entire time. Millions of Americans are going through the same thing. The book <em>Indomitable,</em> and sibling inspirational speaking tour, are my way to take everything bad that has happened to me because of trauma and chronic pain, and turn it into a mechanism to help others who are living in torture break free.  </span></p>

<p><span><strong>THE BACKGROUND:</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Depending on the source, there are 50 to 116 million Americans affected by chronic pain, and I am one of the worst cases. On the evening of April 9, 1995, three nerves were avulsed (ripped) from my spine when a half-ton truck crushed me into the side of the highway at 100 miles-per-hour. My pelvis was completely shattered, both femoral arteries severed, and bone fragments ripped apart multiple internal organs. </span></p>
<p><span>No surgeon or specialist at the top in the nation Denver General Hospital thought I would survive the 45-day coma. When I survived it was hailed by many as a miracle. I never felt like a miracle; all I felt was severe pain...</span></p>
<p><span>Three years ago I decided to write a book, but I knew what I wrote needed to be much more than an autobiography if it was to help the millions of others who suffer from pain. I returned to college to become a better writer, learned how to research properly, and buried myself in primary research. </span></p>
<p><span>The primary research and statistics I reveal in <em>Indomitable </em>do not reveal an easy path for the pain patient. An overwhelming majority of <em>extremely severe</em> chronic pain patients are never referred beyond their primary care physician who is typically not trained to treat chronic pain. I was told ""learn to live with it"" repeatedly for twelve years; then I met the man who slashed my pain in half within a week of meeting me. I never received any help from primary care. My fear is that many people are lose hope because they have complete faith in a physician who is unqualified to say, “There is nothing that can be done.” </span></p>
<p><span>The future isn't all dark for pain patients and <em>Indomitable </em>is not an attack on modern medicine. I have partnered with several top scholars, experts, and medical professionals to provide viable options for pain patients in <em>The Chronic Pain Survival Guide</em>. Every pain patient is unique so the information in <em>Indomitable</em> is presented in broad strokes. I do not attempt to give medical advice, rather the book is meant to point the patient in the direction of those who can give them valuable medical advice. </span></p>
<p><span>There is nothing worse than feeling horrible, losing the hope of feeling any better, and contemplating a future where each step is accompanied by severe pain. <em>Indomitable </em>is written in a manner to make the pain patient passionate about their recovery, and emboldened about their right avoid unnecessary suffering all day... every day. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>THE PROJECT LEAD:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Timothy J. Miller is a 37 year-old Cultural Anthropology major, freelance journalist and photojournalist, public speaker and poet/writer from Denver, CO. April 9, 1995, he was one of four passengers ejected from a GMC pickup truck during a high speed rollover accident. After being slammed to the ground hard enough to break bones and rupture internal organs, Timothy was then rolled over and crushed into the side of the highway by the half-ton vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span>Seventeen years later Timothy J. Miller is on a mission to relieve suffering in America. Chronic pain is largely uncontrolled and he understands, firsthand, the depression and hopelessness that walks hand-in-hand with severe chronic pain. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. With the book <em>Indomitable,</em> and related speaking tour, Timothy hopes to help our most tortured friends and family members turn away from the darkness of chronic pain, and turn into the light of quality of life. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>THE FUNDING:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This Indie Go Go request is for $24,999 to complete the full<em> Indomitable </em>manuscript, pay to have it professionally edited, prepare the manuscript for publishing including graphic and web design, travel expenses to secure contracts with contributors and conduct top priority interviews, and to finalize the <em>Indomitable</em> inspirational speaking tour. I have spent years buried deep in primary research and have enough to fill several books. As relationships with top pain related nonprofits, medical professionals, and mental health professionals grow and flourish, the book and speaking tour become more succinct and focused on presenting the most important information in the easiest to understand manner<em>. </em>Much of the prewriting is complete and the chapter structure has been refined to fit a standard word count of approximately 80,000 words.<em> </em></span></p>
<p><span>I am making this request now, because if I can fund this book and speaking tour before January then I will take spring semester off from college to finish the <em>Indomitable</em> lineup. I cannot be a successful full-time student and put my everything into this book and public speaking tour. I still have six to 10 years of college left as I am pursuing several doctorates</span></p>
<p><span>I am ready. Countless college professors and top industry professionals support the book. All I need is your support and I can begin the journey of bringing an <em>indomitable</em> spirit and inspirational  story to those who need it most. I cannot do it without your help!

<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>THE POETRY:</strong> Every chapter will be summarized with a poem by Timothy J. Miller. This is a poem from the COMA chapter. </span></p>
<p><span>People often ask me what it was like to be in a coma. They ask like it was an amazing experience similar to zip-lining the grand canyon and their intrigue and excitement levels increase immediately as they ask. Questions about seeing ""the light"" and other religious references are very common. I decided to put one of those 45 comatose days into a poem so I never have to tell the story or revisit the memories again. It has been seventeen years and far time I shed myself of that pain. The poem represents the last day of the coma, each previous day was similar... repetitive, and those feelings still haunt me seventeen years later. There was no white light, a morphine allergy had a lot to do with that, but I only experienced darkness and fear for a month and a half. What follows is one of those days.</span></p>

THE PREMISE:
 
The premise of Indomitable is simple. The primary care physician who fired me as a patient in 1995 said something I heard echoed repeatedly over the following twelve years, “There is nothing that can be done for your pain. You need to learn to live with it.” When a physician, who is not interested in trying many options, runs out of options, “Learn to live with it"" is a knee-jerk reaction. The problem I have with the phrase “learn to live with it,” is there was an answer for me, and it was a medication available long before my accident. Because of the health care system, and the federal government’s mingling, I had to fight for over a decade to find the help I deserved. I lived in constant electroshock torture the entire time. Millions of Americans are going through the same thing. The book Indomitable, and sibling inspirational speaking tour, are my way to take everything bad that has happened to me because of trauma and chronic pain, and turn it into a mechanism to help others who are living in torture break free.

THE FACTS: (please see works cited below for links to original works)

Army Surgeon General


In 2010, after 12 months of research by a team of experts, the Surgeon General of the Army and commander of U.S. Army Medical Command reported, “The failure to adequately address pain in the health care system continues to result in unnecessary suffering, exacerbation of other medical conditions, and huge financial and personnel costs.”

 

American Pain Academy

A recent market research report indicates that more than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain and that approximately 3- 4.5% of the global population suffers from neuropathic pain, with incidence rate increasing in complementary to age.
 

The C.A.T.O. Institute


Conservative estimates say that there are 30 million to 50 million sufferers of chronic pain, which is one doctor for every 6,000 pain patients. The average pain doctor has maybe 300 patients. Pain patients are very difficult to manage and require intensive attention, so there are not nearly enough pain doctors to handle the workload.

 

The American Association of Pain Medicine

The total annual incremental cost of health care due to pain ranges from $560 billion to $635 billion (in 2010 dollars) in the United States, which combines the medical costs of pain care and the economic costs related to disability days and lost wages and productivity.
More than half of all hospitalized patients experienced pain in the last days of their lives and although therapies are present to alleviate most pain for those dying of cancer, research shows that 50-75% of patients die in moderate to severe pain.
An estimated 20% of American adults (42 million people) report that pain or physical discomfort disrupts their sleep a few nights a week or more.

Nearing the breaking point, stress fractures spray into spider-webbed fireworks.
Mental infrastructure faltering, concrete cracks, articulated rebar exposed.
Endless nightmare dreamscape, repetitiousness, nerves hammered like a blacksmith's tools.
Will heated white hot in a forge, pounded paper thin on the anvil;
Constricting slowly -python patience- bone crusher, the aperture reduces.
Thrown in a hole for my own protection, medicated with no discretion.
Opened up, weakened state, transfused with dreadfulness;
Anemic, nothing sacred, death raps on my mind's screen door,
Mesh sails, hapless vessel, wind picks up taunting my inability to help myself;
Filled with holes losing buoyancy, reduced to tears and broken pleads.
Apathetic suffrages, pathetic prayers boring deep, changing me,
Losing faith, close to giving up. STOP!
I am never surrendering.
 
[End Transmission]
 
Awake... in the nick of time.
""Timothy, Timothy you were in an horrible accident. You've been in a coma.""
Fall back into the pillow, tension on arm restraints loosens,
Sleep for the first time in forty five days. Safe... for the moment.
 
 
THE NEXT STEP: 
Over the next few weeks I will post a chapter structure, several podcasts updating my progress with the book, and samples from the Indomitable Keynote presentation. I also have a photo essay on chronic pain that will be posted by December 1, 2012 in the updates section of my Indie Go Go funding request. 
 
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART:
Thank you! Thank you for supporting my effort to bring quality of life to the conservatively estimated 50 million sufferers of chronic pain in the United States and over a billion chronic pain victims worldwide. I hope this is the signal shot in a very long race to beat chronic pain, I would love to have you as a running partner, and remember... always be Indomitable!

</div><p>Dr. med. Nils Lynen, specialist for orthopaedics and trauma surgery from the Praxiszentrum Nordrhein in Aachen, shared his opinion about how <strong>back pain can be cured, relieved and prevented with plank exercises</strong> and how much he likes the idea of the Plankpad. He recommends the dynamic plank workouts using Plankpad 3 - 4 times a week.  </p><p>Right now he has one of our latest prototypes, to use it at the therapy of some of his patients.</p><p><a href=""https://www.thegoodbody.com/back-pain-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Approximately 8 out of 10 people do suffer from back pain.</a></p><p> </p><h3>The Plankpad tested at the gym</h3><div>

<p> </p>
</div><p>After Plankpad was tested by around 100 people among family and friends, we took it to a famous gym in Cologne (Germany) to ask fitness experts and bodybuilders about their opinion.</p><p>We thought they would be very critical about playing games while exercising, but we were pretty surprised that even bodybuilders who are used to heavy and intense exercises also <strong>had much fun using the Plankpad</strong> with the smartphone app. They could also exceed their limits and challenge themselves while enjoying the game.

By playing a game, your focus is more into the game than on counting every second. It makes you plank much longer, reaching your goals faster while the time flies by having fun. About the plank exerciseBenefits of Planking:
Prevent and get rid of back pain 
Get in shape 
Better posture 
Get a strong core 
Better motor coordination 
Strengthen muscles 

Builds abs 
Increases the body’s metabolism 
Makes you burn fat
Planking is proven to be one of the most effective workouts to build a strong core, align the spine and activate many important muscles of our bodies at the same time. Because the focus is on the core region, planking prevents and reduces lower back pain among many other injuries. You can conquer that desired six-pack and it also makes the amazing job of increasing the metabolism and burning calories while holding the plank position.Activate many important muscles: 

Neck 
Arms 

Shoulders 
Chest 

Abdominals 
Back 

Glutes 
Legs 
 Dr. med. Nils Lynen (Orthopedic Trauma Surgeon) shares his opinion about Plankpad

 
Dr. med. Nils Lynen, specialist for orthopaedics and trauma surgery from the Praxiszentrum Nordrhein in Aachen, shared his opinion about how back pain can be cured, relieved and prevented with plank exercises and how much he likes the idea of the Plankpad. He recommends the dynamic plank workouts using Plankpad 3 - 4 times a week.  Right now he has one of our latest prototypes, to use it at the therapy of some of his patients.Approximately 8 out of 10 people do suffer from back pain. The Plankpad tested at the gym

 
After Plankpad was tested by around 100 people among family and friends, we took it to a famous gym in Cologne (Germany) to ask fitness experts and bodybuilders about their opinion.We thought they would be very critical about playing games while exercising, but we were pretty surprised that even bodybuilders who are used to heavy and intense exercises also had much fun using the Plankpad with the smartphone app. They could also exceed their limits and challenge themselves while enjoying the game. In the end, everyone who has tried it out, wanted to own one for themselves.Plankpad can be used as a Balance BoardThe Plankpad can also be used as a Balance Board for:
Working your lower muscles out 
Increasing your body balance 
Motor coordination 
Reaction time 

Stability 
and to prevent injuries 
Therefore, we developed two games specifically for the use as a Balance BoardThe app can be mirrored to surf or ski on your TVPlankpad used as a balance board makes lots of fun on the big screen, when it is connected/mirrored via Apple TV, Chromecast, Samsung TV, etc.And it is fun for kids as well! Children need lots of movement – and Plankpad helps them: simply click on the surfer or snowboarder game on the smartphone or tablet app, position yourself on the Plankpad and start surfing. That helps to develop the balance and strengthens the entire body. Plankpad in detailPlankpad itself is made of a fine long lasting and high-quality wood with a walnut finishing to make it look outstanding. The top is covered with a special foam where you can rest your arms to assure comfortable planking exercises. Plankpad comes with a special mat - so you don't slip, don’t make any noise and to protect your floor. We also added a nice handle to carry the Plankpad. Plankpad App with different Games and WorkoutsWe created a perfect fitting app that synchronizes the Plankpad between your smartphone.

savons à quel point il est difficile d’accéder à ce genre de
produit.  Maman de deux enfant, je voulais retrouver la forme mais
pas n’importe comment. Je voulais des produits naturels.  Quand
j’ai commencé à prendre les compléments alimentaires du commerce
lambda et spécialisé, je me suis vite aperçue que la santé avait
un prix.  Aujourd’hui’ hui, je veux proposer à chacun et chacune d’entre
vous l’accès au bien être à un prix juste. Car nous avons tous
le droit aux bonnes choses.
<p>J’ai donc l’honneur de vous
demander de participer à ce projet qui sera sans aucun doute une
aventure que vous ne regretterez pas.  <br/></p>merci a tous pour votre soutien. <br/><br/>                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439059621/gqp5636logdtjzradftz.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/><br/><br/><h2><b>L'équipe</b></h2><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439059804/ctvxwezwmrwrq3noekw3.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 180px; height: 180px;""/> Créatrice/conceptrice graphiste: Mlle Ouvrier.

savons à quel point il est difficile d’accéder à ce genre de
produit.  Maman de deux enfant, je voulais retrouver la forme mais
pas n’importe comment. Je voulais des produits naturels.  Quand
j’ai commencé à prendre les compléments alimentaires du commerce
lambda et spécialisé, je me suis vite aperçue que la santé avait
un prix.  Aujourd’hui’ hui, je veux proposer à chacun et chacune d’entre
vous l’accès au bien être à un prix juste. Car nous avons tous
le droit aux bonnes choses.
J’ai donc l’honneur de vous
demander de participer à ce projet qui sera sans aucun doute une
aventure que vous ne regretterez pas.  merci a tous pour votre soutien.                                                L'équipe Créatrice/conceptrice graphiste: Mlle Ouvrier.

How do I install it?
          </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
              
  Installing WowerShower is easy. It has been designed 
to simply attach on to most existing shower head brackets. You unscrew 
your existing shower head and attach the same hose to the back of 
WowerShower and that's it!
          </p>
<p>
              
Do I have to take it down in-between using it?
          </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
              
That's totally up to you. It was designed with 
discretion in mind, so looks like any other ordinary shower head, just 
with a built-in ergonomic handle. So to the untrained eye its intended 
use is far from obvious.
          </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
              
  The G-spot stimulation bumps on the dildo were 
specifically placed to fit between your fingers perfectly when in use as
 a handle during shower time.  These features together with the curved 
handle really do make for something that just feels 'right' in your 
hand, providing a more pleasurable shower experience.
          </p>
<p>
              
Is this safe in terms of hygiene?
          </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
              
  Yes, WowerShower is made from a polymer blend 
containing special antibacterial additives.  Common sense would suggest 
you clean it using an antibacterial soap or an approved sex toy cleaner 
on a regular basis, but due to the way WowerShower works &amp; the 
environment it operates in, the product is pretty much self cleaning.  
If you prefer, you could always apply a condom to the handle for extra 
peace of mind.

God has shown us things this week that tell us this money WILL BE raised, but we need your help.<br/><br/>My brother and his wife are the amazing parents of three wonderful boys. Their oldest two boys are autistic. The younger of the two is more severely affected by it. He is thirteen years old and does not talk (among other issues). Being unable to communicate is frustrating for him, which was leading to meltdowns of epic proportions. To keep him from hurting himself, my brother and SIL would have to throw themselves in the line of fire. Often, my SIL was alone and would end up battered and bruised while trying to keep her baby from hurting himself. It got to the point where she had to lock herself in the bathroom more than once and dial 9-1-1. There is only one live-in facility in the state of Oklahoma that is qualified to take care of someone with issues like my nephew's, but in order to get the facility to take him in, my brother and SIL have to share parental rights with the state. They are working with autism support advocates and attorneys within the court system to fight for the care of their son. It was that or keep him at home and wait for the day when he'd put his mother and/or himself in the hospital.<br/><br/>My nephew has been in this facility since August. My brother, his wife and their other two boys have been slowly recovering from the severely stressed environment in which they were all living. The facility wants them to come to therapy sessions once a week. The only problem, besides having to take time off work every week and figure out care for their other two boys, is that they do not have transportation to make the four hour round trip every week. At this point, they're lucky their car gets them to work. They probably still have nightmares about a particular trip back to the facility that ended with them broke down (different car) on the side of the highway on a 100 degree day with my nephew in the car. Eventually, they were joined by ten state troopers, two ambulances, a fire truck and at least one news crew (who probably peed themselves once my fiercely protective, mama bear SIL was done with them).<br/><br/>The facility has been threatening to kick my nephew out if my brother and SIL don't start coming to therapy sessions every week. The powers that be at the facility don't particularly care that the parents have no way of getting there, nor do the parents have the financial means for the gas/food/child care/loss of work that would entail. It's not safe for my nephew or his family for him to live at home. If they can't make it to therapy sessions, the only way to make sure their son gets the care he needs and deserves would be to relinquish all of their parental rights. That's just wrong! Through the wonderful and mysterious ways of our powerful God, a reliable vehicle is being made available to my brother's family at a substantial discount. The dealership providing the vehicle can only hold it for 60 days.  Now we just have to pay for it.  We WILL pay for it. I can't even describe to you how much I know this deep down in my soul, but we can't do it alone. We need help. God has shown us that that's the way this is going to happen. They're good, Christian people who want to protect their boy. God is telling us there are people out there who can help them do this! If you work for a business that can help, please talk to them.  If your church can help with a donation or a love offering, every cent would be appreciated. If God has blessed you with an abundance, and you feel moved to pay it forward, please consider helping this family.<br/><br/>If money is raised beyond the $13,000.00 goal, those funds will be used for travel expenses and child care on the days of the therapy sessions, for supplemental help with legal expenses, and for the purchase of a refrigerator, since the family's fridge has now broken down for the sixth time.<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read this! God bless all of you! <br/></p></span></span></span></div>","We, together with God, family, friends and people we haven't met, are going to raise $13,000 for a family in need.

To keep him from hurting himself, my brother and SIL would have to throw themselves in the line of fire. Often, my SIL was alone and would end up battered and bruised while trying to keep her baby from hurting himself. It got to the point where she had to lock herself in the bathroom more than once and dial 9-1-1. There is only one live-in facility in the state of Oklahoma that is qualified to take care of someone with issues like my nephew's, but in order to get the facility to take him in, my brother and SIL have to share parental rights with the state. They are working with autism support advocates and attorneys within the court system to fight for the care of their son. It was that or keep him at home and wait for the day when he'd put his mother and/or himself in the hospital.My nephew has been in this facility since August. My brother, his wife and their other two boys have been slowly recovering from the severely stressed environment in which they were all living. The facility wants them to come to therapy sessions once a week. The only problem, besides having to take time off work every week and figure out care for their other two boys, is that they do not have transportation to make the four hour round trip every week. At this point, they're lucky their car gets them to work. They probably still have nightmares about a particular trip back to the facility that ended with them broke down (different car) on the side of the highway on a 100 degree day with my nephew in the car. Eventually, they were joined by ten state troopers, two ambulances, a fire truck and at least one news crew (who probably peed themselves once my fiercely protective, mama bear SIL was done with them).The facility has been threatening to kick my nephew out if my brother and SIL don't start coming to therapy sessions every week. The powers that be at the facility don't particularly care that the parents have no way of getting there, nor do the parents have the financial means for the gas/food/child care/loss of work that would entail. It's not safe for my nephew or his family for him to live at home. If they can't make it to therapy sessions, the only way to make sure their son gets the care he needs and deserves would be to relinquish all of their parental rights. That's just wrong! Through the wonderful and mysterious ways of our powerful God, a reliable vehicle is being made available to my brother's family at a substantial discount. The dealership providing the vehicle can only hold it for 60 days.  Now we just have to pay for it.  We WILL pay for it. I can't even describe to you how much I know this deep down in my soul, but we can't do it alone. We need help. God has shown us that that's the way this is going to happen. They're good, Christian people who want to protect their boy. God is telling us there are people out there who can help them do this! If you work for a business that can help, please talk to them.  If your church can help with a donation or a love offering, every cent would be appreciated. If God has blessed you with an abundance, and you feel moved to pay it forward, please consider helping this family.If money is raised beyond the $13,000.00 goal, those funds will be used for travel expenses and child care on the days of the therapy sessions, for supplemental help with legal expenses, and for the purchase of a refrigerator, since the family's fridge has now broken down for the sixth time.Thank you for taking the time to read this! God bless all of you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I struggled for years with infertility.  After 5 years, I finally had a daughter and I knew I wanted to do something to help others that struggled like I did.  I created My Hopeful Journey with my personal funds and prize money from 2 business plan competitions.  I have an MBA and a personal connection to the infertility community.  I also have collaboration partners in this community that ROCK!  Some are highlighted in the e-nfertility gift basket!!!</p>
<p>Now, I would like to create an iPhone app that brings together resources, events, information, a fertility organizer and more in 1 app.  This will be a one stop app to help SIMPLIFY infertility diagnosis and treatment for the patient. This concept brings the best use of technology to the end user with a strong focus on collaboration!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Most of the development work has been done already.  The My Hopeful Journey fertility organizer has been live for over year.  We have already started the app development but need funding to finish the development for some of the key areas such as the resources directory, products and events pages.  We would also like to make some much needed enhancements to our website too.</p>
<p>I am 100% commited to this project and every dollar contributed will go DIRECTLY towards the development of this app. and the prizes that support it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign serves multiple purposes.  Of course, it promotes this app and funding for this project.  It also opens the door to speak about infertility and breaks down the stigma and silence associated with it. </p>
<p>Infertility changed me as a person forever.  I would like to take the most difficult time in my life and use that experience to help others.   I want to make this process as easy as possible for other intended parents.. this is a way that I can contribute to the community in a meaningful way. I feel so blessed to be a mother and I want to give others hope too!</p>
<p>I have already developed My Hopeful Journey with my personal funds.  I have won the support of the business community and have received many success stories from women that have used My Hopeful Journey during their treatment.  I am committed to the success of the Infertility Survivial Kit and to this community.  Help me to make this a success. </p>

<h3>Hi I am Nancy Redburn,</h3>
<p>I have been a volunteer Paramedic for many years. Unfortunatey, there is no disablity or retirement for those of us who run, light and sirens blazing to your emergency as a volunteer. I loved helping and was a hand holding paramedic. The doctors always asked why my patients, no matter how injured, came into the ER smiling. I explain that is was my job to treat them with the best medicine and the best attitude (and worst jokes).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have now been diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, adenocarcinoma. The bills are mounting up and we can not keep up. My husband is an airline mechanic makes about $50,000 / yr. so there is nothing saved and we may lose our home. My chance of survival is 6% but I am fighting it, as best I can. They say it is slow cancer and that I may last as much as 6 months, but by then we will have lost our home.</p>
<p>Any help even a dollar or two, will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Please thank a Paramedic or a firefighter when you see them. We try to help at your darkest hours.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of 5 young hard workers that wanted to have an extra project in their life. MMA is one of our common ground; we all are passionated by this sport.</p>
<p>When we analyzed the needs in Belgium, we realized a lot of competitors and fans were waiting for shows to be well-organized and that's what drive us all. We are ready to spend our time and energy to provide a great promotion that will help the athletes being seen by our local fans !</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Via this crowdfunding, we want everyone to get something. For our first event (Genesis, which will be held in Mont-Saint-Guibert on the 29th of October), we will offer different things to all fighters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medals to all participants</li>
<li>A Novice+ tournament will be held, the winner will get a trophy</li>
<li>Our amateur main event will be for a huge cup of 120 cm !</li>
<li>Our main event will be a professional title fight, winner gets a belt.</li>
<li>All Pro fighters that end their fight with a finish will get a financial bonus for the show.</li>
<li>The fighters involved in the best fight of the night also get a bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all these gifts will be given to the athletes to thank them for the shows they offer the fans, we would like to give an opportunity to the fans to thank them back, by being a part of this project, in helping us buying these gifts.</p>
<p>We get something: a financial help. And we thank the fans by assuring a great show. We thank the athlete by giving gifts.</p>
<p>Fans get something: A great show. And they thank athletes by financing the gifts. And they thank us by helping us financially.</p>
<p>Athletes get something: Great gifts for their performance. And they thank fans and us by giving their best.</p>
<p>Everybody win. Nobody lose.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have already shown how serious we are and how important it is to feel that everyone is involved in this project, having the same vision. We want everyone to go in the same direction, and we look to make everyone happy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There exist a lot of risk but we measured and will control all of them. We will face financial challenges as there are a lot to think about; rent the place, the MMA ring, pay the fighters, the audio-visual materials, etc. We are looking for sponsors everyday and we feel confident we will find the budget we need. If not, we are ready to put our own money on the line because we truly believe in the success of this project.</p>
<p>Also, some athletes might get injured leading to the event. But we have a big athletes database that would insure late-replacement if needed and we will be able to make sure the show goes on for the fans !</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are looking for partnerships and sponsors of all kinds. If you are interested, feel free to contact any of us, we will be happy to discuss it with you: chris/max/ally/linda/jerem@360-mma.com</p>
<p>The more visible we are, the more our athletes will be visible. Share our Facebook page and invite your connections to follow our beautiful project: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/360MMA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/360MMA/</a></p>

<h3>Greetings everyone!</h3>
<h3>My name is Junneen, I live in California and I have a friend Melanie Hood that lives across the united states in Valrico, Florida (we met in a clickinmoms.com photography class online).</h3>
<h3>A group of us, who took the class, all stay in contact via a closed facebook group, we mainly share information about photography. Recently...Melanie shared that she has no running water in her house...and it has been THREE weeks!</h3>
<h3>She just found out that her well is not repairable(huge crack) and she needs $6500 dollars for a new well! She and her family do not have the money for a new well, they live on a fixed income and her son and husband are on disability. They have been showering at the in laws, we all know how that would be :).  I think most of us would be painfully inconvenienced if we did not have water for even 1 day(especially with kids)!</h3>
<h3>The $6500 dollars would help them get a new well and dig a deeper well so the water quality is better. Her water is currently a lovely tint of orange and their white clothes turn orange when washing....ew! The well is currently at 150 feet (not the correct depth for a well, hence the bad water quality).  </h3>
<h3>She did not ask for me to do this...I simply thought I'd put it out there to see if people would be kind and help her! I'm sure she would love any amount of donation to get her and her family running water ASAP! All the money (less indigogo's fee) will go directly into her paypal account. </h3>

But today I'm here to ask for your help,  I  am in need of extensive dental surgery, totaling $3480 Canadian currency.  <br/><br/>I realize this is a strange matter to come to the internet for, but that amount of cash is simply out of reach for me, I can't afford dental insurance, and my job doesn't offer benefits.

</h3>
The International Longevity Center in Los Angeles has been established
as a unique blend of alternative health and scientific approaches to
holistic health and was founded by the Author and Entrepreneur Marty
Ettington for people -<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> who are serious about
living a longer, healthier life. </span><br/><br/><br/><br/>
Complementary alternative medicine and <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"">life
extension methods </big>have become
increasingly popular among Americans over the past several years as an
important factor for individual patient care and for the health care
system as a whole. <br/><br/>
The <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);""><span style="""">good news</span></big>
is that health breakthroughs in longevity are accelerating. The<big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"">
bad news</big> is that all available
information is highly <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);""><span style="""">biochemistry or nutrition
centric driven</span></big>
by the revenue oriented health industry. But our <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);""><span style="""">longevity research</span></big>
shows exactly, that our body, mind and soul needs <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);""><span style="""">more mindfulness</span></big>
to build up Personal Longevity, listen up people…<big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"">biochemistry
and choosing the right nutrition alone does not do the job of building
up personal longevity !</big><br/><br/>
PLUS there are tons of great literature and individual courses out
there focusing on new age topics like yoga, holistic mindset building
or natural food awareness - <big style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 153);""><i><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">But
the problem is there is no one training program combining holistic and
medical health training all in one place with the goal to completely
cover…</span></i><span style="""">all for Personal
Longevity  building principles !</span></big><br/><br/>
Courses and Seminars about how to leverage and build up Personal
Longevity either do not exist or are still very hard to find.
Improvement seminars in order to build better longevity in our entire
body, mind and soul system as immediate usable, actionable learning
programs and personal implementation plans, but -<br/><br style=""""/><big style=""font-weight: bold;""><big>This

already exist for consciousness-expanding and life enriching

order to leverage our full human potential for building up our Personal

Our small team of scientists, engineers, self-experimenters, and early
adopters are continuously researching within the fields of long term
health, longevity, medicine, and many other related fields to generate
expert advice, expert research, and expert guidance within our
Longevity workshops. <br/><br/><h3>PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE VIDEO OF LONG LIVED PERSONS FROM 120-250 YEARS OLD BELOW</h3>
<br/>
On a continuous basis we are applying this knowledge to develop long

and educational employee health programs for organizations, including
providing information for the aspect of government planning and
optimization perspectives like nursing home planning. <br/><br/><big><big><span style=""color: rgb(35, 140, 0); font-weight: bold;""><i>But
we would need your support to take it up a notch now, in order to bring
our scientific based information about “How to build Personal

<i><big style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">How
about instead of
having to deal with chronic illness, to have perfect long term health,
incredible relationships, a career you love, a life filled with
happiness and
enough life time to fulfill your bucket list ?</big>

</h3>



The center sees itself as a important “Think Tank” and learning supplement for knowledge on optimal health and longevity within our society. <br/><br/><p>During  the Long Term Health and Personal Longevity workshops and seminars, matters like Chronic Illness, and many other health concerns are addressed in a breakthrough way, that bridges the gap between cutting edge science and holistic /alternative medicine, aiming to help people in unique holistic ways to cure their chronic illness patterns, resulting in improvements from being weak, having more energy, bringing individuals from feeling old and frankly or just getting ready to die to developing new long term health and longevity patterns ! </p><br/>We think this is important in our society.

</h3>More and more we are finding out there are many things we can do to not only avoid illness, but to actually reverse it! Your body is designed to heal itself naturally and then keep you healthy—IF you know how to do it.
<br/><br/>With each biological discovery, the human species climbs one step further toward gaining complete control over its own life processes. 50 years ago the average lifespan was 50 years, now it is more than 75 years. For every year we live more, we have the chance to enjoy our being on this planet more, especially as we are responsible custodians of its environment.
<br/><br/><h3><i><span style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"">Based on our research we
believe our potential to live long lives may be unlimited from both
historical records and from current scientific research. The following video is about 14 mins long and shows persons
from 120-250 years old.</span></i></h3><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/tIwWLcV8qVY?rel=0"" width=""530""></iframe></div><p></p><p><br/></p>
<p>While it took 10,000 years for humans to figure out the structure of DNA, it only required a little over 50 years to map out the entire human genome! Genes are the cell’s “operating system,” enabling young healthy cells to function flawlessly. Gene expression is unfavorably altered as we age, which is what ultimately causes us to degenerate and eventually die.
<br/></p><br/>If one looks at the rapid technology advances we enjoy today, the probability of conquering aging can be easily analogized. Just think of the progress that has been made in other fields:
<br/><br/>•	From counting on fingers to supercomputers.
<br/>•	Riding on horse and buggies to flying on jet planes.
<br/>•	Waiting for the pony express to instant email.<br/>•	Stage plays to satellite TV.

</h3><p>Every choice we make in dealing with complicated societal boundaries like continued financial world issues, climate and environmental change, political corruption, energy, or food and water crises, affect all of us, and it seems to me like we are almost the first generation that can really influence the choice whether or not our humanity is going to survive well or not. <br/></p><p>We believe, that with the right set of long term health and longevity planning, within a powerful combination of psychological, spiritual, vital forces, and physical principles, many chronic conditions, aging fears, and other societal future concerns can be addressed in a positive way and cured by changing to a more conscious lifestyle, which is the key for change. <br/></p><p>In doing so, we empower ourselves to have unlimited support for the creation of all that is life afﬁrming, life enhancing, and life expanding - we believe that we all can change the world by reorganizing our lives to align ourselves with the intention to consciously positively evolve and begin co-creating a world of a more positive personal freedom for us all ! <br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Planned Move To New Location (Use of funds) </h3><p>Please support this scientifically grounded and positive movement.<br/></p><p>We did a reality check of our business fundamental needs and here it is below… <br/></p><p>We have already everything lined up, a great concept and a great team…, we just need YOU to make it happen, so we can actually start the move in our center. <br/></p><p>With funds raised, we can purchase equipment, pay business permit fees, make a lease down payment for the first half year, establish workshop readiness in the new building and pay for all costs which are involved for the new location start up. <br/></p><p>
We will have expenses for professional services (lawyer, accountant, consultant, space designer, etc.), permits and inspections, beginning inventory, marketing, pre-opening labor, etc. We also want to set aside operating capital to pay bills, our employees, and ourselves a bit, until the International Center becomes profitable. <br/></p><p>Expenses anticipated include personnel, marketing, sales, legal work on contract agreements with our provider network, accounting, and admin expenses. <br/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>WISHLIST Building Number One:<br/>
</h3><p>We spotted an absolute charming and great enough office building to lease space for our new Center location. It is on 18411 Crenshaw, Torrance, CA 90504 within the Los Angeles Metro Area. See a picture of it below… <br/></p><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://mkettingtonbooks.com/pitch-graphics/town-hall.png"" src="""" style=""width: 432.75px; height: 244px;""/><br/></p><p>We have checked several buildings and other center project plans and we are confident that we have now a realistic range of costs even beyond the expenses for equipment, fixtures, furnishings, and contractor labor. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""435"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSEO61A6Fv9A&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=435&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>To estimate possible future business performance of the first international center is not an easy task, as there is much to compare with for now. But we project a high number of average workshop signups, and the number of expected students that will visit our courses each day, as we hope will show growth month by month. Other new age related chains have already proven that they are able to grow month by month with their programs. <br/></p><p>
We have determined within our monthly financial projections possible loss or profit that can be expected from the business and we are planning to set aside a capital reserve to cover any projected monthly losses, so that your business can keep operating as we strive for profitability. <br/></p><p>
We have checked several project plans and we are confident that we now have a realistic range of costs even beyond the expenses for equipment, furnishings, programs and workshops and contractor labor. </p><p>What we have already achieved: <br/></p><p>•	We have formed a management team <br/></p><p>•	We have developed our longevity training curriculum <br/></p><p>•	We have developed the design for the new center </p><p><br/></p><h3>Why we need your support <br/>
</h3><p>
Now, we are here on INDIGOGO because our current location has limited space availability and as we are growing we also really could need your help to secure a bigger location for the Longevity Center, so we can run more long term health research and personal longevity seminars and workshops in a bigger way for you. <br/></p><p>By supporting the first of its kind Longevity Center in America, you would help to accomplish… </p><p>•	That everyone get’s a chance to leverage and develop their own long term health and personal longevity to its maximum, <br/></p><p>•	To create a real chance to help improve consciousness about long term health lifestyle in our society and lower our high healthcare tax burden. <br/></p><p>My team and I want to invite you to support our efforts – it really needs YOU to accomplish that consciousness-expanding and life enriching experiences change in our society. <br/></p><p>All that is only possible, if my team and I would be able to establish and open the new International Longevity Center and build it up as a great location.

<h4>Will
the 10 Principles of Personal Longevity Really Work
for Me?</h4>
</span></b></b></span></b></b></b><span><span><p>The
10 principles are based on real research on the root
causes of long term health, happiness, and longevity. Even following
just a few
of these principles will dramatically improve your long term
health--and
therefore you longevity. Our concept of the 10 principles embodies not
just
psychological, spiritual, vital forces, and physical health issues, but
also
current research in medical longevity science.</p>
<p>Our
Center’s mission is to get the 10 principles out to
the world. One of the best ways to do this is through training and
teaching
longevity, where students learn to apply these principles to their
lives and
others, but it is up to the students to implement these principles into
their
everyday lives.</p></span></span><b><b><h4><b><span><b><b><span>There
are many Anti-Aging centers out there, what makes our  Center different?</span></b></b></span></b></h4>
<h2><b><span><b><b><span></span></b></b></span></b></h2>
<b><span><b><b><span></span></b></b></span></b></b></b>Not only are our workshops one of the first worldwide programs with clear step by step instructions on How to build Long Term Health and Personal Longevity, but they are also one of the best sources around for learning how you really can prolong your life 10, 20 or more years<br/><span><span>
<p>Measuring
success or the need to change what you are
doing is the only effective way to work on each individual's
“total health
project”.</p>
<p>This
measurement process also includes our soon to be
launched long term health and longevity concierge subscription
services, where
students will be able to measure their non-physical and physical health
and
make changes as a result to improve their scores.</p>
<p>There
is already all sorts of spiritual health
information of the web – why do I need your methods?</p>
<p>Individual
pieces of related information can be found
elsewhere, but this is the only place where you can find it within a
step by
step process….<span> 
And our implementation
process is pretty unique.</span></p></span></span><b><b><b><span><b><b><span>
<h4>What
are Longevity Coaching Seminars?</h4>
</span></b></b></span></b></b></b><span><span><p>These
are workshops from 2-8
hours where we teach about the 10 principles of personal longevity to
student and
how to implement them in their life. We do both in person and within
online
seminars.</p></span></span><b><b><b><span><b><b><span><h4>Why
do we need donations?</h4>
</span></b></b></span></b></b></b><span><span><p>There
is a lot more in our plans of all the things we
want to do and provide in our center, which we could not do only by
bootstrapping.</p>
<p>We
really would need a bigger location to deliver all of
our training workshops and proceed with our research on longevity. We
also have
some new longevity teaching services to launch like the fist long term
health
and longevity concierge subscription service in America, where students
really
can for the first time build up their long term health and longevity on
a
guided program like never before; stating this services will take a lot
of our
start-up dollars.</p>

Testimonials about our Programs and Workshops:</h3><p>I did not realize prior to taking Marty’s longevity course just how dependent the length of my life was on my thoughts and beliefs about age. I have only scratched the surface of this important course, and already I can see conditioned thought dissolving as awareness and scientific evidence replaces my upbringing. May may all be able to live a thousand without even knowing it ! Think of the careers I could try out! Think of the bucket list of activities I could accomplish! Think of the enlightened spirit I could arrive at if I did not have to keep starting at age zero over and over again!!--<b>Cheryl a successful Diet Coach


</b></p><br/><p>Was excited to take this course to share new information with my clients in health and wellness. Was excited to see how it would benefit my health-and it has. I will incorporate what I've learned with all of my clients so they can understand how they can change their lives. <b>                                                                                                 Carmela-An experienced Life Coach, NLP, Reiki Master, and several more certifications

ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL LONGEVITY CENTER

The International Longevity Center in Los Angeles has been established
as a unique blend of alternative health and scientific approaches to
holistic health and was founded by the Author and Entrepreneur Marty
Ettington for people - who are serious about
living a longer, healthier life. 
Complementary alternative medicine and life
extension methods have become
increasingly popular among Americans over the past several years as an
important factor for individual patient care and for the health care
system as a whole. 
The good news
is that health breakthroughs in longevity are accelerating. The
bad news is that all available
information is highly biochemistry or nutrition
centric driven
by the revenue oriented health industry. But our longevity research
shows exactly, that our body, mind and soul needs more mindfulness
to build up Personal Longevity, listen up people…biochemistry
and choosing the right nutrition alone does not do the job of building
up personal longevity !
PLUS there are tons of great literature and individual courses out
there focusing on new age topics like yoga, holistic mindset building
or natural food awareness - But
the problem is there is no one training program combining holistic and
medical health training all in one place with the goal to completely
cover…all for Personal
Longevity  building principles !
Courses and Seminars about how to leverage and build up Personal
Longevity either do not exist or are still very hard to find.
Improvement seminars in order to build better longevity in our entire
body, mind and soul system as immediate usable, actionable learning
programs and personal implementation plans, but -This
is EXACTLY what our Longevity Center is concentrating on.“Not
only are our workshops one of the first worldwide programs with clear
step by step instructions on “How to build Long Term Health
and Personal Longevity”, but they are also one of the best
sources around for learning how you really can prolong your life 10, 20
or more years” --Marty
Ettington, Founder of the International Longevity Center Los Angeles
 All biotechnics aside, we should not overlook the huge opportunity that
already exist for consciousness-expanding and life enriching
experiences by tapping into our inner body, mind and soul resources, in
order to leverage our full human potential for building up our Personal
Longevity. 
Our small team of scientists, engineers, self-experimenters, and early
adopters are continuously researching within the fields of long term
health, longevity, medicine, and many other related fields to generate
expert advice, expert research, and expert guidance within our
Longevity workshops. PLEASE MAKE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE VIDEO OF LONG LIVED PERSONS FROM 120-250 YEARS OLD BELOW

On a continuous basis we are applying this knowledge to develop long
term health and personal longevity learning programs for individuals
and educational employee health programs for organizations, including
providing information for the aspect of government planning and
optimization perspectives like nursing home planning. But
we would need your support to take it up a notch now, in order to bring
our scientific based information about “How to build Personal
Longevity” within workshops & seminars to the world !
 Chronic Disease Prevention & Treatment
How
about instead of
having to deal with chronic illness, to have perfect long term health,
incredible relationships, a career you love, a life filled with
happiness and
enough life time to fulfill your bucket list ?





The center sees itself as a important “Think Tank” and learning supplement for knowledge on optimal health and longevity within our society. During  the Long Term Health and Personal Longevity workshops and seminars, matters like Chronic Illness, and many other health concerns are addressed in a breakthrough way, that bridges the gap between cutting edge science and holistic /alternative medicine, aiming to help people in unique holistic ways to cure their chronic illness patterns, resulting in improvements from being weak, having more energy, bringing individuals from feeling old and frankly or just getting ready to die to developing new long term health and longevity patterns ! We think this is important in our society.
  

Results of 10 Years of Research
More and more we are finding out there are many things we can do to not only avoid illness, but to actually reverse it! Your body is designed to heal itself naturally and then keep you healthy—IF you know how to do it.
With each biological discovery, the human species climbs one step further toward gaining complete control over its own life processes. 50 years ago the average lifespan was 50 years, now it is more than 75 years. For every year we live more, we have the chance to enjoy our being on this planet more, especially as we are responsible custodians of its environment.
Based on our research we
believe our potential to live long lives may be unlimited from both
historical records and from current scientific research. The following video is about 14 mins long and shows persons
from 120-250 years old.
While it took 10,000 years for humans to figure out the structure of DNA, it only required a little over 50 years to map out the entire human genome! Genes are the cell’s “operating system,” enabling young healthy cells to function flawlessly. Gene expression is unfavorably altered as we age, which is what ultimately causes us to degenerate and eventually die.
If one looks at the rapid technology advances we enjoy today, the probability of conquering aging can be easily analogized. Just think of the progress that has been made in other fields:
•	From counting on fingers to supercomputers.
•	Riding on horse and buggies to flying on jet planes.
•	Waiting for the pony express to instant email.•	Stage plays to satellite TV.
 


In our Longevity Center we strive to achieve further funding which enables us to finance ongoing scientifically based longevity projects while laying the groundwork for our center location in the not-too-distant future.

Every choice we make in dealing with complicated societal boundaries like continued financial world issues, climate and environmental change, political corruption, energy, or food and water crises, affect all of us, and it seems to me like we are almost the first generation that can really influence the choice whether or not our humanity is going to survive well or not. We believe, that with the right set of long term health and longevity planning, within a powerful combination of psychological, spiritual, vital forces, and physical principles, many chronic conditions, aging fears, and other societal future concerns can be addressed in a positive way and cured by changing to a more conscious lifestyle, which is the key for change. In doing so, we empower ourselves to have unlimited support for the creation of all that is life afﬁrming, life enhancing, and life expanding - we believe that we all can change the world by reorganizing our lives to align ourselves with the intention to consciously positively evolve and begin co-creating a world of a more positive personal freedom for us all ! Planned Move To New Location (Use of funds) Please support this scientifically grounded and positive movement.We did a reality check of our business fundamental needs and here it is below… We have already everything lined up, a great concept and a great team…, we just need YOU to make it happen, so we can actually start the move in our center. With funds raised, we can purchase equipment, pay business permit fees, make a lease down payment for the first half year, establish workshop readiness in the new building and pay for all costs which are involved for the new location start up. 
We will have expenses for professional services (lawyer, accountant, consultant, space designer, etc.), permits and inspections, beginning inventory, marketing, pre-opening labor, etc. We also want to set aside operating capital to pay bills, our employees, and ourselves a bit, until the International Center becomes profitable. Expenses anticipated include personnel, marketing, sales, legal work on contract agreements with our provider network, accounting, and admin expenses. WISHLIST Building Number One:
We spotted an absolute charming and great enough office building to lease space for our new Center location. It is on 18411 Crenshaw, Torrance, CA 90504 within the Los Angeles Metro Area. See a picture of it below… We have checked several buildings and other center project plans and we are confident that we have now a realistic range of costs even beyond the expenses for equipment, fixtures, furnishings, and contractor labor. To estimate possible future business performance of the first international center is not an easy task, as there is much to compare with for now. But we project a high number of average workshop signups, and the number of expected students that will visit our courses each day, as we hope will show growth month by month. Other new age related chains have already proven that they are able to grow month by month with their programs. 
We have determined within our monthly financial projections possible loss or profit that can be expected from the business and we are planning to set aside a capital reserve to cover any projected monthly losses, so that your business can keep operating as we strive for profitability. 
We have checked several project plans and we are confident that we now have a realistic range of costs even beyond the expenses for equipment, furnishings, programs and workshops and contractor labor. What we have already achieved: •	We have formed a management team •	We have developed our longevity training curriculum •	We have developed the design for the new center Why we need your support 

Now, we are here on INDIGOGO because our current location has limited space availability and as we are growing we also really could need your help to secure a bigger location for the Longevity Center, so we can run more long term health research and personal longevity seminars and workshops in a bigger way for you. By supporting the first of its kind Longevity Center in America, you would help to accomplish… •	That everyone get’s a chance to leverage and develop their own long term health and personal longevity to its maximum, •	To create a real chance to help improve consciousness about long term health lifestyle in our society and lower our high healthcare tax burden. My team and I want to invite you to support our efforts – it really needs YOU to accomplish that consciousness-expanding and life enriching experiences change in our society. All that is only possible, if my team and I would be able to establish and open the new International Longevity Center and build it up as a great location. 

Thank
you for your time and attention.

Our management team of personal trainers, doctors and health advisors are all there for holding courses on longevity and to develop personalized health plans for students and answer any question a student may have around the topic personal longevity development.

Will
the 10 Principles of Personal Longevity Really Work
for Me?
The
10 principles are based on real research on the root
causes of long term health, happiness, and longevity. Even following
just a few
of these principles will dramatically improve your long term
health--and
therefore you longevity. Our concept of the 10 principles embodies not
just
psychological, spiritual, vital forces, and physical health issues, but
also
current research in medical longevity science.
Our
Center’s mission is to get the 10 principles out to
the world. One of the best ways to do this is through training and
teaching
longevity, where students learn to apply these principles to their
lives and
others, but it is up to the students to implement these principles into
their
everyday lives.There
are many Anti-Aging centers out there, what makes our  Center different?

Not only are our workshops one of the first worldwide programs with clear step by step instructions on How to build Long Term Health and Personal Longevity, but they are also one of the best sources around for learning how you really can prolong your life 10, 20 or more years
Measuring
success or the need to change what you are
doing is the only effective way to work on each individual's
“total health
project”.
This
measurement process also includes our soon to be
launched long term health and longevity concierge subscription
services, where
students will be able to measure their non-physical and physical health
and
make changes as a result to improve their scores.
There
is already all sorts of spiritual health
information of the web – why do I need your methods?
Individual
pieces of related information can be found
elsewhere, but this is the only place where you can find it within a
step by
step process…. 
And our implementation
process is pretty unique.
What
are Longevity Coaching Seminars?
These
are workshops from 2-8
hours where we teach about the 10 principles of personal longevity to
student and
how to implement them in their life. We do both in person and within
online
seminars.Why
do we need donations?
There
is a lot more in our plans of all the things we
want to do and provide in our center, which we could not do only by
bootstrapping.
We
really would need a bigger location to deliver all of
our training workshops and proceed with our research on longevity. We
also have
some new longevity teaching services to launch like the fist long term
health
and longevity concierge subscription service in America, where students
really
can for the first time build up their long term health and longevity on
a
guided program like never before; stating this services will take a lot
of our
start-up dollars.


Testimonials about our Programs and Workshops:I did not realize prior to taking Marty’s longevity course just how dependent the length of my life was on my thoughts and beliefs about age. I have only scratched the surface of this important course, and already I can see conditioned thought dissolving as awareness and scientific evidence replaces my upbringing. May may all be able to live a thousand without even knowing it ! Think of the careers I could try out! Think of the bucket list of activities I could accomplish! Think of the enlightened spirit I could arrive at if I did not have to keep starting at age zero over and over again!!--Cheryl a successful Diet Coach


Was excited to take this course to share new information with my clients in health and wellness. Was excited to see how it would benefit my health-and it has. I will incorporate what I've learned with all of my clients so they can understand how they can change their lives.                                                                                                  Carmela-An experienced Life Coach, NLP, Reiki Master, and several more certifications
I was interested in the program so I can add more tools to my practice and help women achieve better health and longevity in their lives. Also, so that my clients can learn to use their intuition for safety in their lives. I learned more about people who have lived really long lives so that now I know it's possible and the importance of my spiritual connection. It will also allow me to better help clients to develop their life purpose                                                                                                                         Kat- A certified hypnotherapist and personal life coach",49.0,4,"3 Campaigns
