<p><span><span>Hello I'm Charlesetta Hawkins, the purpose of this campaign is to fund the legal and registration expense for a non-profit 501(c) 3. </span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><span>I am seeking to create a foundation in memorial of my son Brandon Blake Hawkins. The goal of this foundation is to provide assistance to individuals and families with disabilities by reducing stigma, promoting awareness, offering resources and  navigating them to various  developmental resource systems. Once the success of the BBHF non-profit status is obtained we look forward to partnering with like organizations, to open the first handicapped playground for the disabled in our community.We purpose to fund annual Christmas Galas for the mentally and physically challenged in various cities though out the United States.</span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><span>Brandon was born November 16,1985 with Cerebral Palsy</span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><span>Despite having a disability,he was such a fun loving person. In raising and caring for him I purposed to always give him the same opportunities that any child deserved and should have. I included him in a variety of things, I had no control over how others looked at him, I was more concerned on how Brandon looked at himself. </span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><span>Though out his life Brandon attended many special education programs starting at the age of 8 months old. Numerous developmental therapies to enhance his chances in life. Special Olympics, bowling, field trips overload, I can't name them all, zoos, petting zoos, farms, museums, operas ,dances, shopping trips, swimming, camping, horseback riding, gardening, his macaroni and rice art, finger, and brush paintings, clay sculpting, crafts I will forever cherish. </span></span></p>
<div> </div>
<p><span><span>On October 10, 2008, my son had a terrible fall. As a result of that fall,the last year of his life, he faced much pain and suffering. Brandon fought a good fight, even in his illness he continue to succeed in winning the hearts of people. October 8,2009 Brandon passed on to a higher calling,no longer limited. He walked with a huge gape here on earth, I now image him running, leaping and jumping. His once 5 word vocabulary is no more, my belief is that he is a great orator in heaven.</span></span></p>
<div> </div>
<p><span><span>So,now it is left up to myself and others to carry on his legacy. I want to share these opportunities in the same fun-loving, happy spirit as Brandon. This is how we give back,this is how we keep that spirit alive for others to share. </span></span></p>

Brandon was born November 16,1985 with Cerebral Palsy

Despite having a disability,he was such a fun loving person. In raising and caring for him I purposed to always give him the same opportunities that any child deserved and should have. I included him in a variety of things, I had no control over how others looked at him, I was more concerned on how Brandon looked at himself. 

Though out his life Brandon attended many special education programs starting at the age of 8 months old. Numerous developmental therapies to enhance his chances in life. Special Olympics, bowling, field trips overload, I can't name them all, zoos, petting zoos, farms, museums, operas ,dances, shopping trips, swimming, camping, horseback riding, gardening, his macaroni and rice art, finger, and brush paintings, clay sculpting, crafts I will forever cherish. 
 
On October 10, 2008, my son had a terrible fall. As a result of that fall,the last year of his life, he faced much pain and suffering. Brandon fought a good fight, even in his illness he continue to succeed in winning the hearts of people. October 8,2009 Brandon passed on to a higher calling,no longer limited. He walked with a huge gape here on earth, I now image him running, leaping and jumping. His once 5 word vocabulary is no more, my belief is that he is a great orator in heaven.
 
So,now it is left up to myself and others to carry on his legacy. I want to share these opportunities in the same fun-loving, happy spirit as Brandon. This is how we give back,this is how we keep that spirit alive for others to share. 
Sadly so many children and adults with disabilities miss out on these opportunities because of a lack of funding and resources.

We can uplift the quality of life for an under served, under acknowledged population of people.They deserve a chance to not just live, but really live, and live it up!
Please join me in launching the Brandon Blake Hawkins Foundation, where together we can make a difference! 
Brandon Loved Life!!!

</h2><h3>What We Need?</h3><p>Of course, we would love to receive a million dollars from this campaign! With a million dollars, we could bypass the need for the market to start as a temporary venue and go straight into building a permanent home for Watershed Market. We envision a marketplace built out of re-used materials, such as train cars and shipping containers, repurposed to be vendor stalls and restaurant booths.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>We dream BIG at Watershed Market!!!</b></h3><p>Until then, <b>Watershed Market is asking for a minimum of $5,000</b>, to help fund the infrastructure of our first weekend market, on<b> March 22nd &amp; 23rd, 2014 @ 2322 Polk St. Houston, TX 77003</b>. </p><br/><h3>Your donation will help fund:</h3><p style=""line-height: 21.75px;""><b>Insurance and Permits</b> - You’ll help us cut through the red tape like a hot knife through butter!</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Equipment</b> - Generators, stage, audio &amp; visual equipment, bike racks, vendor tents, seating, medical kits (Safety First!); plus tools to prepare and keep the land looking beautiful.</span><br/></p><p><b>Support a Vendor</b> - Help fund a booth for an up-and-coming vendor, educator, or entrepreneur with a really great idea. </p><p><b>Staff &amp; Volunteer Uniforms</b> - So you can spot all the hard working volunteers supporting Watershed Market and stop us to say, “HI!”</p><p><b>Recycling Program</b> - Watershed Market will be a “No Trace Left Behind” destination, it is our goal to reduce trash by running a recycling program, encouraging our food vendors to use only recyclable/compostable containers, and providing water for reusable water bottles.</p><p><br/></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Houston is changing both physically and mentally. Everyday more people move to Houston to build families and businesses. We must lay down the foundation for sustainable communities. Watershed Market vendors must meet a quality standard we have dubbed <b>GLASIR. </b>This means <b>GREEN, LOCAL, ADAPTIVE, SUSTAINABLE, INNOVATIVE, RE-USE.</b><b> </b>Watershed Market will help bolster this standard by being a place that encourages local commerce through supporting local creatives and pedestrian culture. WSM will promote educating citizens about alternative transportation lifestyles, such as walking, cycling, and public transit - rather than driving their car. It will provide a place for people to have access to fresh produce from a daily farmer’s market, in an area that is currently considered a “food desert”. WSM will be a home for the arts by creating a venue for live performances. Watershed Market is a stepping stone to creating stronger communities in Houston!</p><br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you for your support!</h2><p>Along with custom WSM “Launcher” T-shirts and WSM branded collapsible, reusable water bottles, a number of Watershed Market artisans have donated one of a kind art pieces to thank our gracious ""Launchers"". Check out the great rewards we have for you below. Contribute and help launch Watershed Market a reality for Houston, TX!</p><p>- <b>For our ""Launchers"" in Houston, we will be hosting a ""Pick-up"" Party in January to receive all rewards!

Staff & Volunteer Uniforms - So you can spot all the hard working volunteers supporting Watershed Market and stop us to say, “HI!”Recycling Program - Watershed Market will be a “No Trace Left Behind” destination, it is our goal to reduce trash by running a recycling program, encouraging our food vendors to use only recyclable/compostable containers, and providing water for reusable water bottles.The ImpactHouston is changing both physically and mentally. Everyday more people move to Houston to build families and businesses. We must lay down the foundation for sustainable communities. Watershed Market vendors must meet a quality standard we have dubbed GLASIR. This means GREEN, LOCAL, ADAPTIVE, SUSTAINABLE, INNOVATIVE, RE-USE. Watershed Market will help bolster this standard by being a place that encourages local commerce through supporting local creatives and pedestrian culture. WSM will promote educating citizens about alternative transportation lifestyles, such as walking, cycling, and public transit - rather than driving their car. It will provide a place for people to have access to fresh produce from a daily farmer’s market, in an area that is currently considered a “food desert”. WSM will be a home for the arts by creating a venue for live performances. Watershed Market is a stepping stone to creating stronger communities in Houston!Thank you for your support!Along with custom WSM “Launcher” T-shirts and WSM branded collapsible, reusable water bottles, a number of Watershed Market artisans have donated one of a kind art pieces to thank our gracious ""Launchers"". Check out the great rewards we have for you below. Contribute and help launch Watershed Market a reality for Houston, TX!- For our ""Launchers"" in Houston, we will be hosting a ""Pick-up"" Party in January to receive all rewards! You will receive information about the party through email in the future. - For ""Launchers"" needing shipping, WSM will require extra funding for S&H. PERKS!!!

The current model commonly keeps donors at arms-length and disconnected from beneficiaries-you don’t interact or exchange benefits with them.</p><p><b>Solution</b></p><p>Our projects are mutually beneficial for all parties, both the donor and the recipients.  We identify projects that would potentially bring the donors closer and give them a sense of connection to where their funds are going. There is a gap where Sacred Valley Initiative can tap into a huge need and reach companies and employees wanting strong personal connections and a real face to their giving.  Indigenous villages have many lessons to share and we will incorporate this rich wisdom tradition from the communities that we support to empower and impact Americans to live and work in more harmonious ways and more in balance with the Earth.</p><p><b>Target Market</b></p><p>We are attracting and appealing to a broad donor base.  They range from a wide variety of places; corporations, active/ adventure groups, progressive universities, and cultural, spiritual and global enthusiasts.  These are people that already have a giving culture and helping them see where their funds are going and forging that sense of connection has intrinsic value to them. Providing that connection can both better retain their giving over time and in many cases dramatically increase it. Secondly, we tap into previously under-served markets. There are people that want to give but aren’t. By offering a wide range with different levels of involvement and participation, we attract and have an appealing aspect of what we offer to support our social projects and bring connection. For companies and organizations, there are many layers of involvement that can take place, for example, employees can visit Peru first hand on a service trip and cultural tour or a more structured leadership training can take place.  Corporate giving can occur as well. There are also under-served potential people in Peru. We will support ongoing poverty, malnutrition, orphaned and abandoned children and environmental concerns that we will address.  Within the first two years, we would be approaching progressive companies and universities that would be taking their giving programs to the next level of involvement while improving the global economy.</p><p><b>Competition</b></p><p>As Sacred Valley Initiative is a relatively new and small player in giving, we want to be cognizant that there are probably organizations with a bigger footprint, more renowned, established or have been around longer to the extent with greater economies of scale and access to more funds.  And while that is a real challenge, we think that there are several ideas that work to out advantage.  With our Executive Director, Kim Kaplan having lived in Peru the past three years, we have an advantage of the deep relationships and experience we have established on the ground.  These connections are invaluable as they have allowed us to start partnership giving programs immediately without being crowded yet and start the right authentic ones that allow meaningful relationships.  Sacred Valley Initiative has the advantage to travel to cities where the ideal markets and development needs are.</p><p><b>Team</b></p><p>We are working with experts on the ground in Peru with our project developments in sustainability and global initiatives to improve the quality of life with the utmost integrity while sustaining the indigenous cultures. We are closely connected with the Presidents of the Indigenous communities with which we work and with accredited permaculture and sustainable agriculture players in the design and development of green houses and support for our nutrition programs.  Key partners on the ground in Peru also include deep relationships across the hotel, restaurant and tourist sections, including high-end luxury resorts down to all price point levels of accommodations that can meet any leadership training or group tour needs. We have a wide range of top-level NGO’s (non-governmental organizations) we are working closely with in the development sector of projects we support.  We have sustainable tourism partners who are an accredited and insured travel agencies to organize the trips and events in Peru that are flawless streamlined experiences surpassing all parties expectations.  An international team of experts are available to build, train and lead substantial curriculum for leadership trainings and service trips who include, book authors, environmentalist, and industrial psychologists integrated with local Shaman and culture history specialist to maximize an enriching culture experience.  We have the team that covers all aspects necessary for the success of our mission.  To the extent it is scalable, we will need legal and accounting council as we grow and increase staff.</p><p><b>Social Impact</b></p><p>The social impact of connecting meaningful corporate giving programs to Sacred Valley Initiative will bring awareness and create a more cohesive work environment by enriching and satisfying the human desire to give.  Donors will gain satisfaction, wisdom, while bridging the globe with cultural awareness and deeper human connection. This is forging a new horizon benefiting all participants on a global platform.  The future of Peru and our children’s projects, including orphan aid, educational programs and school development projects with nutritional agriculture aspects: brings forth health, well-being and the actualization of positive self-esteem to underprivileged children that would otherwise not receive opportunities to develop ideally.</p><p><b>Milestones</b></p><p>At six months, we will have talked to eight businesses, universities, and interest groups and expect to have 500,000 dollars committed from our sponsors.  The building development of a school and cultural interactive center in Peru is underway.  At one year, we will have talked to 20 businesses, universities, and interest groups and expect to have 300,000 dollars committed from our sponsors.  So by year end, we will have a total of 800,000 dollars committed by our sponsors.  Also, at the end of year one we will have achieved the following milestones: Completed our first school development project, supported eight orphaned children with aid and subsidized a community with solars lights which currently do not have electricity. However, if we have not been successful we will withdraw our requested stipend until the time we have achieved the year one business objectives. In addition, we will provide each investment group bi-monthly progress reports including successes, issues, problems, and new opportunities. And to ask for their recommendations and suggestions. etc.  Year three-five: emerging into new markets with model in other geographical areas for trainings and social initiatives. i.e. Africa, Tibet and Nepal.</p><p><b>Budget</b></p><p>For our social enterprise of educational journeys to Peru and other remote locations in the world to manifest, we need $8,000. This start-up initiative has been inspired by Founder, Kimberly Kaplan's work with executive summary writing at Washington University's Skandalaris Center of Entepreunerral Studies and her work with Channel 9 Network- KETC digital storytelling class enabling her to be a community producer with the station. </p><p>Our sustainable and orphan children's support in Peru and stateside to flourish we need, an overall annual requirement of $18,000.</p><table><tbody>

We have wonderful social projects including solar light distribution, important nutrition permaculture projects while enriching the lives of the orphans children.We are so proud of the great work taking place on the ground in Peru but they desperately need our support this year.  Sacred Valley Initiative, a registered non-profit 501c3, would like to partner with you this year in collaboration. Through crowd funding we aim to bring you the most amazing experience of a life time. We inspire to share this work with you first hand as we bridge magic places with educational experiences and special community outreach programs that opens us up to a new paradigm that unifies the globe and the supports the people on it.  Please see our full Executive Summary and know we are looking for thoughtful companies, groups and universities to partner with to build a collaborative co-creative model bringing forth a better world and sustainable future for all of us.  Let us facilitate a once in a lifetime experience for you to come to Peru and participate in broadening your horizons while moving the planet toward a more sustainable and rewarding place for all of us to thrive. Prepared by: Kimberly Kaplan, Executive DirectorSacred Valley Initiative, 501c3 non-profitWebsite: www.sacredvalleyinitiative.org Email: kim.sacredvalleyinitiative.orgTelephone: (314) 732-1278EXECUTIVE SUMMARYObjectiveSacred Valley Initiative, a 501(c)3 non-profit is dedicated to creating a more meaningful culture in North America where universities, corporations and social groups can support and participate in giving programs connecting sponsors to social service projects around the world.  Through enriching relationship based giving campaigns, service tours and global leadership educational programs, we facilitate collaborative efforts for the sustainability of the planet and prosperity of the lives involved. ProblemAmerica is currently undergoing a systemic shift where corporations are beginning to implement green initiatives, sustainability acts and awareness and giving programs, where money is deducted from employee paychecks and other incentives to give to charitable projects.  However, in the midst of all this, donors lack a meaningful connection to charitable causes. The current model commonly keeps donors at arms-length and disconnected from beneficiaries-you don’t interact or exchange benefits with them.SolutionOur projects are mutually beneficial for all parties, both the donor and the recipients.  We identify projects that would potentially bring the donors closer and give them a sense of connection to where their funds are going. There is a gap where Sacred Valley Initiative can tap into a huge need and reach companies and employees wanting strong personal connections and a real face to their giving.  Indigenous villages have many lessons to share and we will incorporate this rich wisdom tradition from the communities that we support to empower and impact Americans to live and work in more harmonious ways and more in balance with the Earth.Target MarketWe are attracting and appealing to a broad donor base.  They range from a wide variety of places; corporations, active/ adventure groups, progressive universities, and cultural, spiritual and global enthusiasts.  These are people that already have a giving culture and helping them see where their funds are going and forging that sense of connection has intrinsic value to them. Providing that connection can both better retain their giving over time and in many cases dramatically increase it. Secondly, we tap into previously under-served markets. There are people that want to give but aren’t. By offering a wide range with different levels of involvement and participation, we attract and have an appealing aspect of what we offer to support our social projects and bring connection. For companies and organizations, there are many layers of involvement that can take place, for example, employees can visit Peru first hand on a service trip and cultural tour or a more structured leadership training can take place.  Corporate giving can occur as well. There are also under-served potential people in Peru. We will support ongoing poverty, malnutrition, orphaned and abandoned children and environmental concerns that we will address.  Within the first two years, we would be approaching progressive companies and universities that would be taking their giving programs to the next level of involvement while improving the global economy.CompetitionAs Sacred Valley Initiative is a relatively new and small player in giving, we want to be cognizant that there are probably organizations with a bigger footprint, more renowned, established or have been around longer to the extent with greater economies of scale and access to more funds.  And while that is a real challenge, we think that there are several ideas that work to out advantage.  With our Executive Director, Kim Kaplan having lived in Peru the past three years, we have an advantage of the deep relationships and experience we have established on the ground.  These connections are invaluable as they have allowed us to start partnership giving programs immediately without being crowded yet and start the right authentic ones that allow meaningful relationships.  Sacred Valley Initiative has the advantage to travel to cities where the ideal markets and development needs are.TeamWe are working with experts on the ground in Peru with our project developments in sustainability and global initiatives to improve the quality of life with the utmost integrity while sustaining the indigenous cultures. We are closely connected with the Presidents of the Indigenous communities with which we work and with accredited permaculture and sustainable agriculture players in the design and development of green houses and support for our nutrition programs.  Key partners on the ground in Peru also include deep relationships across the hotel, restaurant and tourist sections, including high-end luxury resorts down to all price point levels of accommodations that can meet any leadership training or group tour needs. We have a wide range of top-level NGO’s (non-governmental organizations) we are working closely with in the development sector of projects we support.  We have sustainable tourism partners who are an accredited and insured travel agencies to organize the trips and events in Peru that are flawless streamlined experiences surpassing all parties expectations.  An international team of experts are available to build, train and lead substantial curriculum for leadership trainings and service trips who include, book authors, environmentalist, and industrial psychologists integrated with local Shaman and culture history specialist to maximize an enriching culture experience.  We have the team that covers all aspects necessary for the success of our mission.  To the extent it is scalable, we will need legal and accounting council as we grow and increase staff.Social ImpactThe social impact of connecting meaningful corporate giving programs to Sacred Valley Initiative will bring awareness and create a more cohesive work environment by enriching and satisfying the human desire to give.  Donors will gain satisfaction, wisdom, while bridging the globe with cultural awareness and deeper human connection. This is forging a new horizon benefiting all participants on a global platform.  The future of Peru and our children’s projects, including orphan aid, educational programs and school development projects with nutritional agriculture aspects: brings forth health, well-being and the actualization of positive self-esteem to underprivileged children that would otherwise not receive opportunities to develop ideally.MilestonesAt six months, we will have talked to eight businesses, universities, and interest groups and expect to have 500,000 dollars committed from our sponsors.  The building development of a school and cultural interactive center in Peru is underway.  At one year, we will have talked to 20 businesses, universities, and interest groups and expect to have 300,000 dollars committed from our sponsors.  So by year end, we will have a total of 800,000 dollars committed by our sponsors.  Also, at the end of year one we will have achieved the following milestones: Completed our first school development project, supported eight orphaned children with aid and subsidized a community with solars lights which currently do not have electricity. However, if we have not been successful we will withdraw our requested stipend until the time we have achieved the year one business objectives. In addition, we will provide each investment group bi-monthly progress reports including successes, issues, problems, and new opportunities. And to ask for their recommendations and suggestions. etc.  Year three-five: emerging into new markets with model in other geographical areas for trainings and social initiatives. i.e. Africa, Tibet and Nepal.BudgetFor our social enterprise of educational journeys to Peru and other remote locations in the world to manifest, we need $8,000. This start-up initiative has been inspired by Founder, Kimberly Kaplan's work with executive summary writing at Washington University's Skandalaris Center of Entepreunerral Studies and her work with Channel 9 Network- KETC digital storytelling class enabling her to be a community producer with the station. Our sustainable and orphan children's support in Peru and stateside to flourish we need, an overall annual requirement of $18,000.

They are similar to us - long time friends and homebrewers (ok, there's 3 of them, and 2 of us :)), decided to open a small scale brewery and now they are doing great. We hope one day we'll visit them in Moorpark, California and try their beers!!!!Other Ways You Can HelpWe hope you have found this project interesting, and that you'll back us!!! We are doing all of this because we love to brew beer, and we love to drink craft beer! Since on Croatian beer market currently doesn't exists a single craft brewery which makes hoppy American ales, help us by sharing our project on your social networks, and tell your friends about it!  Oh yeah, and don't forget, you' re helping to start something great in Croatia. Croatian craft beer revolution!!!!!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Who We are & What We Do

 My company is called cartridge for a cause LLC.  The concept is simple- we collect empty/unused ink and toner cartridges and cell phones at no charge and donate a portion of the proceeds to Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.  All materials that we CAN recycle we do.  Therefore we are focused on keeping these items out of our nation's landfills while at the same time alleviating hunger in Western Pennsylvania.


We need a work van and operating expenses to take this business to the next level and increase our donations to Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. The Food Bank does VERY important work.  They are a non profit that collects and distributes food through a 380 plus member network in 11 counties in Western Pennsylvania. Our company exists to help their cause. 





  The Impact Every cartridge/cell phone that we collect can result in the equivalent of ONE MEAL OR MORE donated to Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.  With your donations we will be able to reach more businesses and service larger accounts thus resulting in larger donations to the Food Bank and help for more people who need it.
Our company is under a year in existence currently, and already we have been able to donate the equivalent of 7,880 meals to the Food Bank.  We have over 100 business partners in Western Pennsylvania and counting.  About half of these partners are listed currently on our company website.
Don't forget- September is Hunger Action Month!



  Our Challenges
Currently we are servicing all of our accounts out of an '08 Ford Fusion which does not allow for a big volume of ink/toner cartridges to be carried in one run. Thus the need for a larger vehicle, not only for this fact, but to be able to service larger clients on a regular basis.

We also offer our services to our clients FREE OF CHARGE.  We offer the recycling bins free and pick up the product at no charge as well.  Therefore an influx of funding will be very helpful to keep up with the costs of the bins, gas, supplies, etc.


Where the Money Will Go

$8,000 to $12,000
We are looking to purchase a used extended work/cargo van that is reliable, with a warranty, and that will last at least a few years. 


$2,000 to $3,000
This amount is earmarked for purchasing recycling bins (public and back office) for new clients.  This includes graphics for the bins.
$1,500 to $2,000
This money will be used to pay Indiegogo fees and to donate directly to Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank from ""perks"" chosen resulting from your donations. This will also be used to pay for some of the actual perks offered.
$1,000
This amount will be used to purchase shipping boxes, packing tape, shipping supplies, etc.

$1 At this level, you get our thanks for helping to make this happen-  We love you!

$20 You'll have one coin waiting for your at CMPC!

$30 You'll have 2 coins waiting for you at CMPC!

$100 Not only will you have 2 coins waiting for you at CMPC-  We'll shoot one with a gun of your choosing (provided we have access to it), record it and give you the casing, coin, and bullet (if we can find it)
Also, don't miss the early bird specials-  get this year's coin at last year's fundraiser prices!

Addons- (please note, none of these addons may applied to the $1 perk)



(EXPIRED- Reserve your serial number as soon as you donate!) +$5 Priority Serial Number selection!  You can pick your Serial number(s) as soon as you donate! You only need to add this once to select numbers for all of your coins! (Regular reservations will open when the campaign closes)

+$5 Domestic Shipping-  Get your coin shipped to you anywhere in the US!

+$10 International Shipping- Get your coin shipped to you anywhere customs will allow me to!

(Expired, only donations from before June 2nd are elgible) +$15 Extra coins! Get one extra coin per $15 

So what happens if we don't make $500?

Well, that's... kinda tough for me-  I'll be rustling up the funds out of my own pocket to make sure the coin happens this year-  But no matter what, a coin is happening!
    So what do coins do for CMPC? They make CMPC probably the only Pony Convention to have their own coin~  And even if someone else makes one-  We were the first-  The coins are a big way to help CMPC be more awesome in a couple ways-   Coins are freakin' awesome!
Last year's coins were a big part of helping CMPC stay afloat for this year-  Help CMPC and get something awesome in return!
You were with us last year and we did it- Made it all the way-  How cool is that!  Now let's do it 2 years in a row! I'm committed to making this happen this year-  I'm putting about $800 of my own money where my mouth is-  Won't you join me?    So, what could go wrong?  Last year, we had a few problems-  Between having a decent way to deliver the coins at the convention and that, aside from the coins, I had nothing else to give to CMPC from the coin campaign-  This year we're going to  address that.  It's true.. Last year's perks cut things way too close.  This year won't have that same problem
Shipping!  Last year I hadn't enabled international shipping- yet I still found 4 donations from other countries-  It was amazing, so this year we're adding international shipping as a real option!
The coins could be delayed at the mint and miss the convention-  I'm prepared for that too.  You'll get your coins.  I'll find a way to get them to you-      So, aside from money, how can I help? Share!   Make videos!  Draw!  With the limited amount of time for this campaign, there's less time to get the good word of CMPC commemorative medallions around! And don't forget to use those share links~  They'll take people directly here!",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Impact

Every time we
help a family stay in their home, we offset the traumas of foreclosure and
positively impact all levels of community. 

The Residents: Foreclsosure abruptly displaces people in ways that almost always lead to reduced quality of life. Eviction can mean children pulled out of school, parents losing jobs after missing too much work, entire families victimized by scammers or other predators.
The Property: Properties sold at
auction often become blighted buildings as scrappers strip them of valuable
pipes, wiring, and appliances as soon as the former residents move out.  

The Neighborhood: Communities are
fractured by foreclosure. Fewer neighbors mean fewer eyes on the street and a
weaker community network. Fewer occupied houses means lower property values and
greater risk of crime. 


Local Government: Some people displaced by
foreclosure will move away, lowering city population. Everything from school
budgets to utility bill rates are affected when population drops. Some people
displaced by foreclosure will stay, increasing the number of people in the city
who need government support, such as housing, to survive.
 

All this can be
avoided when we help people STAY PUT instead of MOVE OUT

  Risks & Challenges 
You never know what will happen at the auction! A few rich speculators can make the prices of these homes soar with the click of a button. Prices start at $500 but UCHC predicts that our homes will sell for an average of $1250. Even then, there's no guarantee. 

WORST CASE SCENARIO, we will buy a home
for only one family. Projections based on past year's experience tell us we
will be able to serve many more.


Our fundraiser will end before the auction
begins so that the money is in place to bid on the properties. Donors will not
know the outcome of the auction until a few weeks after their contribute, but
don't worry, we will absolutely follow up.

If another group of researchers disagrees with the screening criteria, they have to start again from scratch.

</div>","SAVING OUR STANDARDS MEANS SAVING OUR JOBS AND CLIMATE ...       
Problem:  The
notion that we can't afford positive change is unacceptable. Even
in mid-term scenarios we will all end up losing if we continue with production
methods and consumer behavior that can best be called cheap. We don't need
cheap things that eliminate our own income and standards and add to the
destruction of a human-friendly world.
(Part of the) Solution:  Our own daily purchasing decisions determine economic demand
for products and services. If we want responsible businesses,
then we will have to be responsible consumers. This will even save our
jobs. We need to start preferring
goods that are based on our values, which include high wages for workers and
high environmental standards that we have established over centuries. Choosing
this path is the first and foremost element of any successful strategy for
overcoming our economic and environmental calamities. 
With EURESPONSIBLE, we want to help organize positive change by bringing together responsible citizens and companies. Structure and Tasks EURESPONSIBLE

EURESPONSIBLE will conduct and commission scientific research & responsible market analysis. 

EURESPONSIBLE will advise companies on Responsibility Management & Reporting. It will also advise consumers on responsible market behavior.


The EURESPONSIBLE Responsibility Index is to make ""the good"" visible to consumers, also at the point of sale. It will provide a platform for those
companies that are willing to contribute to shaping a better and more
sustainable economy. 

EURESPONSIBLE will use part of its income to plan and implement responsibility projects that aim at creating sustainable business models at a small scale. It will also plan and implement social and ecological offsetting projects.
The founder will form EURESPONSIBLE as a non-profit social enterprise (German corporate law) by the end of the year and use the donations raised here for a) commissioning research and b) funding journalists (currently unemployed) that we plan on hiring for eco-social reporting from European countries.

<p>I am
Blerina, from Gjakova, Kosovo and I represent mothers of children up to 12
years old. In a developing country with a struggling economy, where people
barely make their existence, bad habits flourish. Such habits include but are
not limited to small businesses offering services on: violent video games,
gambling, lotteries; drug use; clubbing; etc . Since these are the only
activities our children are offered in their spare time, it has resulted in our
children becoming violent, less oriented towards reading, school, health and
the worst becoming practitioners of criminal acts.  We are highly concerned with the orientation
our children have taken, therefore our future. </p>
<p><b>Our Campaign </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since
schools can only afford to pay salaries for teachers and the rest of the
teaching is theoretical, we have organized voluntarily to create a facility for
our children, where they can spend their spare time. In this facility children
will be offered different activities to play, read, exercise, create through
crafts, paint, learn etc. This campaign is very important to us, because it
will support us open this facility where we will try to pull children away from

<p>In

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This
campaign is not only important for mothers of Gjakova and their children, is
also important to our future. The children of today, are the leaders of
tomorrow. Let us help them choose better options – read instead of videogames,
play with children instead of gambling, handmade crafting instead of drug use,
outside walks instead of wandering the streets.</p><br/></div>","Who we are
I am
Blerina, from Gjakova, Kosovo and I represent mothers of children up to 12
years old. In a developing country with a struggling economy, where people
barely make their existence, bad habits flourish. Such habits include but are
not limited to small businesses offering services on: violent video games,
gambling, lotteries; drug use; clubbing; etc . Since these are the only
activities our children are offered in their spare time, it has resulted in our
children becoming violent, less oriented towards reading, school, health and
the worst becoming practitioners of criminal acts.  We are highly concerned with the orientation
our children have taken, therefore our future. 
Our Campaign 

Since
schools can only afford to pay salaries for teachers and the rest of the
teaching is theoretical, we have organized voluntarily to create a facility for
our children, where they can spend their spare time. In this facility children
will be offered different activities to play, read, exercise, create through
crafts, paint, learn etc. This campaign is very important to us, because it
will support us open this facility where we will try to pull children away from
streets, drugs, gambling and violet games. Without your contribution, we cannot
start operating the facility. 
Why we need you contribution

In
order to open the facility we need 10500$. So far, we were able to collect from
our own contribution 3000$, but we need your contribution for 7500$ more,
broken down as follows: 
·

·

·

 The calculations are made, to fit 50 children

<p>Refresh is about solutions.  Solutions to the problems facing the environment, our global food and water supply and our health.  At refresh, we are rethinking food, redesigning the farm and redefining agriculture.  By donating to our fundraising campaign, you’ll help us to continue to innovate and develop new technologies to farm more efficiently. </p>
<p>The integration of hydroponics and aquaculture, aquaponics is a balanced ecosystem that virtually eliminates the harmful waste and environmental pollution common in many farming operations.  Aquaponic farms like ours can be located within city spaces preventing deforestation and reducing transportation.  Each day around the world, thirty billion gallons of freshwater are pumped for agriculture.  Our farm uses about five percent of the water that is used with traditional irrigation techniques by using recirculating aquaponic systems.  These systems also increase output, up to four times more food is produced per acre than with traditional soil farming. </p>
<p><br/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/704454_622091614483764_2142702173_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://refreshfarms.com/wp-content/themes/horizon_2.0.2/admin/extensions/timthumb.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Frefreshfarms.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F10%2Fgreen-butterhead-612.png&amp;w=612"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are asking for $19,500 to increase the size of the farm and to make it more sustainable.  Farming more efficiently means less electrical dependence.  To accomplish this, we plan to build a greenhouse aquaponic system to reduce the use of artificial lighting.  In addition, the money raised would be used to purchase solar panels to reduce our electrical expenses.  Two thousand watts of solar power will cut our current electrical bills in half.  Your donations will create less draw from the grid, less impact on the environment and lower operating costs.</p>
<p>By using production techniques that foster the environment instead of depleting our resources, we can simultaneously produce more healthful and nutritious food.  Growing food sustainably involves using no chemical fertilizers, herbicides or pesticides. It means working with nature, instead of against it and not interfering with natural cycles in our environment.</p>

<p>You probably know Heidi. If you do, you’ll know that <strong>she has chosen to devote her life to the care of others, serving some of New York’s most traumatized and underserved children and youth</strong> through drama therapy. You’ll know that she is a loyal friend, always ready to help. You’ll know that she has a big heart with ample space to love a child. You’ll know that she is courageous, smart, passionate, creative and <em>more</em> than well equipped to be a single mom in NYC! </p>
<p><strong>In winter 2012, Heidi entered into a carefully thought-out process of adopting a child from Honduras</strong>. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this part of the world, Honduras is a gorgeous country with an incredible array of natural resources and rich cultural history, from ancient to modern peoples. At the same time, <strong>50% of the Honduran population lives below the poverty line and children become available for adoption in the neediest cases or in cases of abuse/neglect</strong>, where reconciliation has failed.</p>
<p>International adoption is lengthy, costly and an emotional rollercoaster for the parent-to-be. When we found out about Heidi’s plans, we decided that this was an adventure she should not have to travel solo. <strong>We invite YOU to join US in helping bring this extraordinary mother-to-be and her child together </strong>by making a financial contribution that will make a difference.</p>
<p><em>Your entire donation will go directly to Heidi’s adoption fund, bringing a child from Honduras to a family – and village - of love.</em></p>
<p><strong>“<em>Wait</em>!” you say, “I have some questions!” </strong></p>
<p>We thought you might. So we asked Heidi to tell us a little more about her decision before requesting your support. </p>
<h3> <strong>Heidi, what made you choose to adopt? </strong>
</h3>
<p>All my life, I’ve wanted to have children and always thought about the possibility of adoption.  There are so many children out there who need homes and <strong>the idea of sharing <em>my</em> home with a child who would not otherwise have a safe place to live feels like an important gift that I can give</strong>.</p>
<h3> <strong>Why have you chosen Honduras as your adoptive country?</strong>
</h3>
<p>I did my research! Poverty in Honduras has left many families with little choice but to abandon their children on the street or place them in orphanages. <strong>The Honduran orphan population is at an all time high</strong>. The good news is that the orphanages take good care of these children, assuring that they have the best possible beginning in the most difficult circumstances.  In addition, <strong>Honduras is one of a few countries still open to single women adopting and is close enough to NYC geographically for my adopted child to be able to continue a relationship with his or her country of origin</strong>.</p>
<h3> <strong>How much will the adoption cost?</strong> </h3>
<ul>
<li>AGENCY FEES: $9,000  </li>
<li>HOME STUDY + Post-placement/Administrative costs: $5,000 HONDURAS PROGRAM FEE: $19,000                       </li>
<li>TRAVEL to/in HONDURAS: $8,000                                   </li>
<li>IMMIGRATION &amp; GOVERNMENT FEES: $1,225 </li>
<li><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">TOTAL ADOPTION COSTS: $42,225</span></strong></li>
</ul><h3><strong>What do you look forward to most about being a mom?</strong></h3>
<p>Everything that I anticipate is wonderful about raising a child and everything that I don’t know is ahead of me!!!<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What has been the most surprising/crazy/exciting/anxiety-producing/fun part of the adoption process thus far?</strong></h3>
<p>The amount of paper work is no joke and although I was forewarned. I don’t think any adoptive parent could be prepared for what’s involved.  However, I think the most surprising thing is how supportive my community has been. Everybody I know, especially my friends in NYC, are extremely busy and yet they took on this project and this feels like the biggest gift to me ever.</p>
<h3> <strong>What do you want to say to all your fans out there?</strong>
</h3>
<p>I am so grateful for everyone’s support of me during this exciting but difficult and emotional process. <strong>I can’t wait for you all to be a part of this child’s life</strong> – he or she is going to love and need you too!!!</p>
<h3> <strong>What do you want to say to your future child?</strong>
</h3>
<p>I am sitting here thinking of you. I don't know anything about you yet. I don't know if you are a boy or a girl or even how old you will be when we meet. I sit here wondering what you will be like, what you will sound like, what your personality will be, what you will like to do. Will you like sports or music? Will you be a writer or a doctor or an actor? Will you be laughing all the time or making others laugh or will you be serious and pensive, contemplating the deep things of life. <strong>No matter what, you will be perfect to me</strong>.</p>
<p>Your life will a bit different though. You will have two families and be from two countries, which I think will be pretty cool because most kids belong to one. But the best part for me is that I get to be a part of your life in NYC.</p>
<p>All I know is that I want you to live to the fullest potential you have and do anything you want to do. And <strong>my greatest desire is to be your mom and walk with you through this world</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>I love you so much already, even though I don't know where you are or even if you are born yet. I can’t wait to bring you home and introduce you to your whole family</strong>.</p>

You probably know Heidi. If you do, you’ll know that she has chosen to devote her life to the care of others, serving some of New York’s most traumatized and underserved children and youth through drama therapy. You’ll know that she is a loyal friend, always ready to help. You’ll know that she has a big heart with ample space to love a child. You’ll know that she is courageous, smart, passionate, creative and more than well equipped to be a single mom in NYC! 
In winter 2012, Heidi entered into a carefully thought-out process of adopting a child from Honduras. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this part of the world, Honduras is a gorgeous country with an incredible array of natural resources and rich cultural history, from ancient to modern peoples. At the same time, 50% of the Honduran population lives below the poverty line and children become available for adoption in the neediest cases or in cases of abuse/neglect, where reconciliation has failed.
International adoption is lengthy, costly and an emotional rollercoaster for the parent-to-be. When we found out about Heidi’s plans, we decided that this was an adventure she should not have to travel solo. We invite YOU to join US in helping bring this extraordinary mother-to-be and her child together by making a financial contribution that will make a difference.
Your entire donation will go directly to Heidi’s adoption fund, bringing a child from Honduras to a family – and village - of love.
“Wait!” you say, “I have some questions!” 
We thought you might. So we asked Heidi to tell us a little more about her decision before requesting your support. 
 Heidi, what made you choose to adopt? 

All my life, I’ve wanted to have children and always thought about the possibility of adoption.  There are so many children out there who need homes and the idea of sharing my home with a child who would not otherwise have a safe place to live feels like an important gift that I can give.
 Why have you chosen Honduras as your adoptive country?

I did my research! Poverty in Honduras has left many families with little choice but to abandon their children on the street or place them in orphanages. The Honduran orphan population is at an all time high. The good news is that the orphanages take good care of these children, assuring that they have the best possible beginning in the most difficult circumstances.  In addition, Honduras is one of a few countries still open to single women adopting and is close enough to NYC geographically for my adopted child to be able to continue a relationship with his or her country of origin.
 How much will the adoption cost? 

AGENCY FEES: $9,000  
HOME STUDY + Post-placement/Administrative costs: $5,000 HONDURAS PROGRAM FEE: $19,000                       
TRAVEL to/in HONDURAS: $8,000                                   
IMMIGRATION & GOVERNMENT FEES: $1,225 
TOTAL ADOPTION COSTS: $42,225
What do you look forward to most about being a mom?
Everything that I anticipate is wonderful about raising a child and everything that I don’t know is ahead of me!!! 
What has been the most surprising/crazy/exciting/anxiety-producing/fun part of the adoption process thus far?

<h3>Shaving with proper products is really important</h3>
<p>A man will shave approximately 20,000 times in his life. Twenty thousand times, passing tiny blades that slice the hairs just above the skin, trimming between 5,000 and 25,000 hairs each time you shave. Without the proper products his skin will feel the consequences! Proper shaving has become a lost art. Today’s average male has no clue about the fine art of the traditional wet shave that their grandfathers and some of their fathers used to take part in. Instead, they’re accustomed to the cheap and disposable shaving products that companies regularly market. I’m not sure when or why it happened, but the tradition of passing down the secrets of a clean shave abruptly stopped. Thankfully, this glorious male ritual is making a comeback.</p>
<h3>Most products that exist are not good for you...</h3>
<p>With that said, there are few companies that exist that are creating high quality men’s grooming and skincare products. The big box companies create products that have more bad things in them than good. If you’re like most guys, you’ve probably been getting your shaving cream from a can; this blue/green, chemically laced goop does nothing for your skin and smells like a hospital.</p>

<h3>The money will help us manufacture the products.</h3>
<p>We will be using our raised funds to help us manufacture the products. We have bundled these three products together to make the the York Grooming Co. Shaving Kit. By doing so, we are able to give you a dramatic discount on your purchase, and if you buy a longer subscription, you'll get an even bigger discount.</p>
<h3>We want to make it easy and convenient to get our products to you</h3>
<p>To do this, we have created a subscription model.  We deliver a 2 month supply of our products every two months, automatically, if you subscribe to a 6 month or 1 year plan. If you subscribe to the 2 month plan, you will recieve one shipment.  For example, if you subscribe to the 6 month plan, you will initially get a 2 month supply sent right to your door.  After 2 months, another package will arrive with a new set of products.  If you don't need them yet, just let us know and we'll delay shipping.  If you need them sooner, same thing, let us know, and we'll get you the products sooner.  It's easy!</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>
<p>Q/ The perks say it will last for 2 months, how do you know? <br/>A/ The product sizes are actually 60ml, which, with regular use, is about a 2 month supply.  The great thing about York Grooming Co. is that it is a subscription service, so if you order the 6 or 12 month supply you will get a new set of products every two months.  Don't worry, you will get an email before we send anything where you can delay shipment if you havent used up your supply.</p>
<p>Q/ Is shipping included?<br/>A/ We are offering free shipping to Canada and the United States for our Indiegogo backers!</p>
<p>Q/ When will you start to manufacture?<br/>A/ Once we get to 100 kits we’ll begin production immediately. I hope you can help us bring this great product to market.</p>
<p>Q/ Do I need a straight razor or shaving brush to use these products?<br/>A/ You don't need to use a straight razor or shaving brush with our products, but you can!  You can use the same tools that you use now, but a shaving brush does help getting a better lather.  Basically, you can substitute our products for what you are using now and you will get a better product.</p>
<p>Q/ What is the ingredient list?<br/>A/ Our initial ingredient list for each of the three products is as follows (note the INCI names on the package may differ slightly)</p>
<p>The face cleanser has water, coconut oil, almond oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, steric acid, citric acid, vitamin E, beeswax, boric acid</p>
<p>The shaving cream has water, glycerin, shea butter, coconut oil, sunflower oil, steric acid, glycerin, potassium hydroxide, vitamin E, cetyl-stearyl alcohol, boric acid, kaolin clay, citric acid</p>
<p>The post shave moisturizer has water, shea butter, almond oil, stearic acid, cetyl-stearyl alcohol, Vitamin E, beewax, glycerin, carbomer, potassium sorbate</p>

At Step by Step every day we work to create change and to make the dreams of children around the world become a reality. This is why we created a partnership with Horses N Heroes.
 Horses n Heroes is a non profit organization dedicated to providing an equine learning and mentoring experience for young children who come from families with extreme financial constraints. At no charge, these kids are given the opportunity to bond with horses and are taught all aspects of horsemanship including but not limited to riding, grooming, feeding and caring for the donated horses.
Horses N Heroes completely runs on donations, which is why we need your help
What We Need & What You Get
For every $15.00 you give us , we buy Shavings for one week for one horse, and you receive a Step by Step Foundation Wristband.
For every $25.00 you give us, we buy a bag of food for one horse for one week, and you receive 5 Step by Step Foundation Wristbands.
 For every $120.00 you give us, we buy hay for one month for one horse , and you receive 5 Step by Step Foundation Wristbands and  an inspirational book.  
The Impact
You will provide 100% horse care and help this community continue with the program.

<p>A $1 donation can help those who lost their furniture and housewares in the flood begin to rebuild their lives. We know what you're thinking: $1 is just a drop in the bucket. And you're right! However, as we learned from the recent floods, 1.2 Million drops in the bucket adds up to a lot. That's why we've set the lofty goal of raising $1.2 Million in just one month. That's a $1 donation from every person in the Calgary area. (Of course, you're more than welcome to donate more than $1 if you'd like).</p>
<h3>What $1.2 Million will Buy</h3>
<p>All funds raised will be used to purchase Ikea gift cards for those who lost their furniture and housewares in the recent floods. That's 2,000 $600 gift cards, 3,000 $400 gift cards or 12,000 $100 gift cards. Exact amounts will be determined based on need.</p>
<p>Once we've raised the funds, we'll set up a date and time in August to disperse the cards. Proof of address will be required. Online registration may be used to help us better organize dispersement. Should we have gift cards left over, we will reach out to families in other Alberta communities affected by the flood of 2013.</p>
<h3>Leave a Message for Flooded Families</h3>
<div>
<p>Please leave a message with your donation. Messages will be printed and distributed with gift cards to show those who've lost so much just how much we care.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>My name is Michelle Caplan and I'm a Calgary-based Non-Profit Marketing and Fund Development Professional. I moved to Calgary four years ago and am blown away by the incredible people who live in this city. Myself and a group of my friends and colleagues in the Calgary non-profit sector decided we wanted to start a campaign to help people rebuild their lives once they'd had a chance to remediate and renovate their homes. </p>
<p>Please help us show flooded families in Calgary how much we care and help us raise $1.2 Million during the month of July. Your $1 donation <strong><em>will</em> </strong>be more than a Drop in the Bucket.</p>

<p>WE SHIP DISCRETELY! No one will know ;)</p>
<p><strong>We present to you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blowpaste:</strong> The revolutionary oral sex lube that is good for your teeth.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.picresize.com/images/rsz_rsz_img_11618000.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How we came up with Blowpaste:</strong></p>
<p>The creator originally came up with the idea after discovering that the oral lube that she was using contained aspartame and candy-like substances. Knowing that she was going to sleep with a dirtier mouth than before, she was determined to make a product that eliminated having to brush her teeth again. With Blowpaste, she was able to peacefully fall asleep in her lover's arms.</p>
<p><strong>The Creators:</strong></p>
<p>The creator of Blowpaste loves musical theater: singing, dancing and acting. She has spread love and joy around the world through performing. Theater doesn't quite pay the bills and shows are far and few between. So she and her partner are on a mission to spread joy and love through a different outlet. She also cares about her teeth.</p>

<p><strong>Your beautiful contributions:</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to make Blowpaste a staple in personal lubricants around the world. Your contributions will go towards marketing, promotions, and inventory. We are also making tubes and pillow pack samples to help promote Blowpaste.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal and your help:</strong></p>
<p>We set our goal at $5000 but are hoping to exceed that goal. Some of the events we are looking into are Exxotica, AVN, and AdultCon, which cost about $2500 each to display. These events are necessary to introduce Blowpaste to the world, for networking, and to catch the eyes of many distributors and shops. We are also planning on creating competitions and prizes through our social media marketing plan.</p>
<p><strong>Our prizes to you:</strong></p>
<p>This is the fun part! You will receive some pretty nifty prizes for supporting and contributing to Blowpaste. The prizes range from a ""thank you"" to full size 2 oz tubes, sample pillow packs, bachelorette baggies, treasure chest full of samples and more!</p>
<p><strong>No money to contribute? You can still help!</strong></p>
<p>We can still use all the help we can get. If you love our product, but don't have the money to contribute then please ""like us"" or ""share us"" on facebook (facebook.com/blowpaste) and/or tweet about it (twitter.com/blowpaste).

When I observed the good works that they are able to accomplish I was stunned...and overcome. Our modest goals, though quite safe and achievable, seem inadequate in the face of the real needs of our community.

CSU has steadily made this a reality in our community. We boast 3 urban farms and every week handle 1,300 lbs of produce harvested from our sites and by local farmers.

<p class=""BodyA""><strong>We know that by bringing Community Services Unlimited to the Mercado La Paloma, we will be able to feed more families, teach more youth about where their food comes from, and give more families the power to grow their own produce</strong>. Yes, that means more canning, jamming, and cooking together! We’ll be in the good company of local artists, small businesses, and community advocates. And, community members will be able to purchase produce from Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm at our new Village Market Place storefront.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">But, we need your help!  A bigger space means a bigger rent check every month. And moving isn’t cheap. Besides paying the movers, we need new fridges to store our produce, new furniture that fits our space, and new signs so the community knows we’re here. <strong>We need $15,000 for our entire move, but if we raise just $8,500 it will really help us pay for our moving costs and get settled in our new home.</strong></p>

<p>Established in 2010, the Memorial Cup was founded by Santos FC and Lara Media Services (<a href=""http://www.laramedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.laramedia.com</a>) to further their commitment to Oregon's Latinos. Now in its fourth year, the Cup is a non-profit event that provides an opportunity for youths ages 5-17 to compete in an organized tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Soccer = Passion:</strong></p>
<p>In Latino culture, soccer is a passion cultivated from a young age. We remember gathering together with friends and family to watch the big game on TV or simply kick around in the backyard. Families who come to the United States stay connected to their culture through soccer. For many of them, it is a dream for them to see their children playing this beloved sport. Unfortunately, for many students the entrance fee for these tournaments is prohibitively high.</p>
<p>The Memorial cup gives kids the chance to participate in a tournament that is inexpensive and accessible, unlike a lot of league tournaments that are unavailable to the Latino leagues due to a lack of financial resources. It shows these kids and their families that all things are possible. The Memorial Cup is the only affordable soccer tournament that specifically welcomes Latino Soccer clubs and recreational teams to compete.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>The Memorial Cup is the Premiere Latino Soccer tournament in Oregon. In 2012, over 50 teams’ participated and over 5,000 people came out in support. The tournament itself promotes self-esteem, leadership, discipline, and healthy attitudes for people of all ages. Above all, it gives kids a chance to see the power they have within themselves to do extraordinary things.</p>
<p>This event brings families together and connects them to the community at large. For many people, this weekend isn't just a soccer tournament -- it's an opportunity for community groups, government agencies, and businesses to break down barriers and gain access to higher education, health, and leadership opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>With only a few months left before the tournament, we are looking for donations that can help go towards the following areas:</p>
<p><em>-Park and Event Rental Fees</em>. In order for the event to take place, we need money to pay for the cost of renting fields for the teams to play on.</p>
<p>This year we hope to hold the Cup once again at Memorial Park in Wilsonville, the City’s oldest and largest park. The site contains all of the formal athletic fields owned by the City, which are heavily used by local leagues. We will need money to go towards field rentals so multiple teams can play at once.</p>
<p><em>-Referees.</em> What's a soccer match without a good referee? In order to hire experienced referees to oversee the games, we need to raise enough funds to pay them for their time and effort over the Memorial Day weekend. These fees are determined per team, per day and with your help, we can help fill all the open slots for the weekend!</p>
<p><em>-Trophies and medals for the teams</em>. For many teams, the opportunity to participate is the ultimate prize, but we love to reward teams for their excellence and skill. Help us purchase trophies and medals to present to winning teams throughout the weekend, giving students an opportunity to go for the gold and achieve so much more than they could've possibly imagined.</p>
<p><em>-Promotional Materials</em>. The publicity team at Lara Media wants to spread the word about the Memorial Cup all around Oregon and to do that we need to design and purchase flyers, posters and other promotional materials.</p>
<p><em>-Water for teams and volunteers.</em></p>
<p> <strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>Donations of the following would be greatly appreciated: Flats of bottled water, soccer balls, food for volunteers, prizes for the children, or your time! Those interested in volunteering should send a message to contact@laramedia.com.</p></div>","Who We Are:

<h3>Help Me ""Squat"" My House, Snatched by Intentional Community</h3>
<p>What happens when a nonprofit corporation decides it wants to change its mission but poverty-level old people have built homes on the corporation's land, in accordance with its original mission? The corporation evicts the old people — without compensating them for their houses.</p>
<p>And totally gets away with it!</p>
<p>This is what happened to me and my ex-husband Rick, a wrong done to us by an intentional community in Tennessee run by a nonprofit called Rocinante. I lived there and Rick built a house there, and he gave me half-ownership of the house. Rocinante took the house and refused to reimburse Rick or me.</p>
<h3>Simultaneously Help Un-Yoke Me from the Friend I've Been Divorced from for 25 Years</h3>
<p>Due to the poverty caused by Rick being deprived of the house he built, Rick and I have since been yoked together. We are friends, but we have been divorced for 25 years. Both of us have had to live on my social security disability income for two years now, and we both need our independent lives back, and a relief from dire poverty.</p>
<p>Rick has been experiencing TIAs (ministrokes) from hypertension and is not able to work. I am on disability for multiple sclerosis. We are currently living in Mexico in an attempt to be able to afford to exist.</p>
<h3>I Need to Get to Tennessee to Claim My House</h3>
<p>The intentional community is counting on our poverty to keep us from getting our house back. The fact that we are not on site, in Tennessee, could allow our rights to expire, and allows our plight to be completely ignored. Rick is too sick to undertake this project right now, but I need to be there, on site, in the house, in their face, in the media, insisting on justice.</p>
<p>I say, Either let us live in our house, or pay us for it! It's not okay to just steal it.</p>
<p>While Rocinante is no longer the community that Rick and I signed up for — considering the nonprofit dissolved the community, and has treated us disgracefully —Rick built the house, it is paid for, and we need a place we can afford to live.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the house is easily worth $25,000, and those who took the house should pay us for it.</p>
<h3>What I'm Proposing to Do</h3>
<p>After two years of trying to talk to the nonprofit and getting no response, I am ready to go ""squat"" in Rick's and my house until justice is done — in the middle of the nonprofit's antagonism, in spite of those who say I can't, in the winter, in the middle of the woods, and next door to the nonprofit's property manager — a Brazilian street-fighting champion.</p>
<p>While I'm there, I intend to also get justice for my other, elderly neighbor, who was evicted by that street-fighting champ last Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>I intend to be a constant reminder to the wrongdoers, telling the truth and demanding justice. I intend to visit senators and representatives and county officials. I intend to involve media in a big and ongoing way. Some of you will be seeing me on TV, and you will be reading about me on the internet. If you read the detailed story (<a href=""http://www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante</a>), you'll see that some rather famous counterculture heroes are at the heart of this house-grabbing. You will see there is quite an amazing story here.</p>
<p>I intend to achieve: 1) Secure the rights to Rick's and my house so we can live there, rent it out, or sell it; or 2) Be compensated $25,000 for it — and my evicted elderly neighbor gets compensated $10,000 for the house he built.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>All my current income (social security disability) is used to support Rick's and my Mexico household. My savings are gone.</p>
<p>I need money to travel from Mexico to Tennessee. I can take a bus for about $450 (36 hours, with a cheap motel somewhere en route). (Flying would cost around $700 by the time shuttles on both ends are figured in, so I intend to take the bus.) I would like to leave in early January, or as soon as I can.</p>
<p>I need money to get moved into the house, and a reserve for backup lodging should I not immediately be able to get into the house. I will need to get the electricity turned on in the house, which will require a deposit. I may need to buy a heater and a couch  or bed to sleep on. I may need a locksmith. My water pipes may be frozen.</p>
<p>I need money to exist (eat, for instance) while I work hard every day to raise awareness of the situation and achieve a fast, fair solution.</p>
<p>I do not have a laptop, but I will need phone and internet access, in the middle of the woods. An inexpensive smartphone should be able to keep me in touch with the media and provide internet/email access.</p>
<p>I no longer have a car and will need to sometimes pay local people to drive me places. Ideally, I could afford to rent someone's extra clunker. I will need to buy a coat at Goodwill.</p>
<p>I figure $1950 will get me there, get me set up (including utility deposit and phone), pay indiegogo commission, and meet barebones necessary expenses to keep me alive and productive for two months, with a small reserve. By the end of that time, I intend that the house will have been restored to me and Rick, or we will have been reimbursed for the house.</p>
<p>In a non-monetary vein, it might be helpful to have a couple of additional hardy, high-quality squatters with me to swell the ranks.</p>
</div>
<h3>A Call for Justice</h3>
<p>As you can see from the detailed story (<a href=""http://www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante</a>), I spent many years doing volunteer work for the very people — my fellow members on the board of directors! — who then turned around and took Rick's and my house away. These people were supposed to be highly spiritually evolved, but when it came right down to it, their countercultural, nonprofit corporation was just as greedy and amoral, and their functioning just as self-serving, as any corporation anywhere.</p>
<p>I don't want them to get away with it. I want justice.</p>
<p>Anything you can do to help — and to help get the word out — will work to affirm rightness in the world. Please read the detailed story at <a href=""http://www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fukushimafaq.info/rocinante</a>.

<h3>What This Is All About</h3>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Hello everyone!  My name is Heather Riney and I made a decision to leave my corporate job (finance &amp; operations) a little over a year ago.  Like many, I wanted to find a deeper purpose to what I was doing with my life, not merely follow the path that just happened to be laid out in front of me.  I want to be excited &amp; passionate about what I do every day...direct my gifts and talents towards the things that truly matter to me &amp; inspire others to do the same.  I've spent much of the past year traveling to third world countries...learning, volunteering &amp; meeting some incredible people.  From my experiences both abroad and right here within the amazing community that is Nashville, the idea for this business slowly but surely came into focus.  </p>
<p>Atmalogy is a word I essentially made up that captures the essence of the business to serve as a constant reminder of it's purpose.  'Atma,' a Hindu word, loosely means 'one's true self' and 'ology' is 'the study of.'  Atmalogy will be a unique community meeting space...a place where people can come together in a shared space to learn &amp; share &amp; grow.  In this age of abundant technology (while incredibly valuable!), nothing can replace the energy that is created from face to face connection with others. </p>
<p>Located on West End near Vanderbilt, the space will have 8 rooms of varying sizes to accomodate 2 to 75+ people for a variety of needs...client meetings, brainstorming sessions, book clubs, workshops, yoga classes, song-writing collaboration...the possibilities are endless.  It's the perfect setting for individuals and businesses alike to work (&amp; play!) in a setting that is flexible, casual &amp; creative.  There is no monthly commitment and there will even be a way to book the space online.  Prices will start as low as $10 per hour, and discounted packages can lower the rates up to 50%!!!  The space is also being designed in such a way that components such as lighting, acoustics, color scheme, ergonomics &amp; more will be considered to create a space that supports and encourages comfort, productivity, creativity &amp; overall well-being. Several images in the video are renderings created to show examples of the environment being created (also see on Gallery tab).</p>
<p>At the ""heart"" of this space will be an on-site cafe.  Open to those renting the space as well as those who aren't, it will serve a selection of mostly local, organic, healthy &amp; really delicious food and beverage options, many of which have been inspired by the items sampled in the various cafes I discovered during my travels.  Check out the sample menu on the gallery tab.  Catering options for those renting the spaces will also be available.  </p>
<p>Creating this space is incredibly important to me, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring it to the Nashville community.  It's the space I have wished existed during these past several months for my own reasons &amp; everyone I have spoken with has had their own ideas on how they will use it!  Like many of you these days, I find myself working at home or out of cafes.  At home, I'm easily distracted or find myself feeling lost in the seemingly endless, lonely depths of my computer.  Cafes are often noisy - definitely not the setting for a private meeting or call.  This space will combine the networking benefit &amp; convenience of a cafe with the privacy &amp; functionality of a private meeting space.  It will be an accessible resource for the whole community to use as a place to connect &amp; create in a neutral, comfortable &amp; casual (yet still professional) space. </p>
<p>And because I want this to be a space truly shaped and inspired by the community it will serve, I've decided to use this format to raise the funds necessary to make it a reality.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition to my personal investment and the investment from a few individual investors with a complimentary background &amp; mutual passion for the concept, these funds are needed to fully cover the build-out of the space, set-up of a cafe &amp; furnishing of the various meeting rooms.  </p>
<p>Your contributions will translate into dollars to be used toward renting these amazing spaces once our doors are open, items in our cafe, and opportunities to explore some of the types of things that could be happening at any time in the space!  And of course you will be ensuring that an amazing addition to Nashville's community will now be here whenever you need it!!!</p>
<p>Even if you don't live in Nashville currently, your support would be greatly appreciated...maybe one day we can bring an atmalogy to your city too!!!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, there is nothing that replaces the energy &amp; inspiration created by connecting with like-minded people.  There isn't one path to happiness...we each are unique, we each have our own passions, and we each have different things to contribute.  But we are each other's mirrors.  And this space, like none that currently exist, will help to create an environment that allows for meaningful, authentic &amp; exciting connections, so please HELP ME BRING IT TO LIFE!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Just because you can't contribute doesn't mean you can't help!  Spread the word and share this campaign with everyone you know!  Facebook, twitter, you guys know how it works.  :)</p>

At the ""heart"" of this space will be an on-site cafe.  Open to those renting the space as well as those who aren't, it will serve a selection of mostly local, organic, healthy & really delicious food and beverage options, many of which have been inspired by the items sampled in the various cafes I discovered during my travels.  Check out the sample menu on the gallery tab.  Catering options for those renting the spaces will also be available.  
Creating this space is incredibly important to me, and I'm excited about the opportunity to bring it to the Nashville community.  It's the space I have wished existed during these past several months for my own reasons & everyone I have spoken with has had their own ideas on how they will use it!  Like many of you these days, I find myself working at home or out of cafes.  At home, I'm easily distracted or find myself feeling lost in the seemingly endless, lonely depths of my computer.  Cafes are often noisy - definitely not the setting for a private meeting or call.  This space will combine the networking benefit & convenience of a cafe with the privacy & functionality of a private meeting space.  It will be an accessible resource for the whole community to use as a place to connect & create in a neutral, comfortable & casual (yet still professional) space. 
And because I want this to be a space truly shaped and inspired by the community it will serve, I've decided to use this format to raise the funds necessary to make it a reality.






What We Need & What You Get
In addition to my personal investment and the investment from a few individual investors with a complimentary background & mutual passion for the concept, these funds are needed to fully cover the build-out of the space, set-up of a cafe & furnishing of the various meeting rooms.  
Your contributions will translate into dollars to be used toward renting these amazing spaces once our doors are open, items in our cafe, and opportunities to explore some of the types of things that could be happening at any time in the space!  And of course you will be ensuring that an amazing addition to Nashville's community will now be here whenever you need it!!!
Even if you don't live in Nashville currently, your support would be greatly appreciated...maybe one day we can bring an atmalogy to your city too!!!  


The Impact
As I mentioned before, there is nothing that replaces the energy & inspiration created by connecting with like-minded people.  There isn't one path to happiness...we each are unique, we each have our own passions, and we each have different things to contribute.  But we are each other's mirrors.  And this space, like none that currently exist, will help to create an environment that allows for meaningful, authentic & exciting connections, so please HELP ME BRING IT TO LIFE!


Other Ways You Can Help
Just because you can't contribute doesn't mean you can't help!  Spread the word and share this campaign with everyone you know!  Facebook, twitter, you guys know how it works.  :)

<p>I’m a free-spirit, passionate, coffee-drinking,
craft-making, foodie, budding entrepreneur. I am currently at Algonquin College
learning all the tricks of the trade on how to open up my own business. I
believe in doing what I love, and making a living bringing what I love to those
around me. That’s where Ottawa’s Wheelys Cafe comes through. This cart will the
beginning of my long awaited journey to own my own business. For many years I
have dreamt of opening a café where I can be my own boss, make people smile,
and serve yummy food. The fact that the funding is going to be helped by those
around me is such a humbling and encouraging thought. It makes me want to make
this a success even that much more, because you believe in me. </p>

</span>Storage Unit to tuck it in at night</p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will go directly towards
supporting an up-and-coming local eco-friendly business, which is already
exciting!</p>

come along with helping me out. Each and every contributor will be personally
thanked by me.. isn’t that all you need?? No, there’s more to it than that. The

Usaremos las redes sociales para ayudar en la difusión del lugar; para que la gente pueda enterarse del lugar, y además, los lugares con opciones vegetarianas y veganas generan mucha atención en las redes sociales por ser un mercado específico.

Por encima de todo, cuando sí he logrado obtener trabajo, he tenido que usar mi nombre legal, y no tengo la posibilidad de presentarme como quisiera.

But in light of all this violence, i have an idea to solve it. To make my economic situation more stable, i plan on opening a small restaurant. i have worked in multiple restaurants, and my whole family has worked at restaurants for a long time. In fact, the reason my family went to the u.s. in the first place is that my parents wanted to save some money to open a restaurant in our hometown—this plan failed due to my father’s illness and the disenchantment of my siblings and i in the american dream.

This type of help will also be appreciated and thanked. If you can help by donating or by sharing this petition, it will help me a lot.

In the time that i’ve been living in this city, i’ve even had difficulty finding poorly paid and very exploitative jobs. On top of it all, when i have been able to find work, i’ve had to use my legal name, and i don’t have the option of presenting as i would like to.

<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Since 2009 SIP! events has been successfully curating casual,
entertaining, and informative wine parties in homes and offices across Southern
California.  Now, we’re ready to package
our unique approach to wine education and events in, well, a box.  SIP! in a BOX will offer wine enthusiasts
across the country the opportunity to purchase our best-selling wine flights from our online wine shop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/109988/files/20131002230305-sip__2.jpg?1380780185"" src="""" style=""border: 0px; width: 353.1709601873536px; height: 531px;""/></p>
<b></b><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>More than 4
years of successful wine events</b></p>
<p>Our clients count on us to offer something special for their
guests who want to learn about wine in a fun, approachable way. Over the past 4
years SIP! has hosted all kinds of wine events from corporate office mixers to
lively bachelorette weekends to up-scale celebrity dinner parties.  We allow our clients to enjoy the event by
handling all of the details.  We select
and research the wines according to the party’s theme and our wine expert
brings everything needed to serve and pour the wines for the party.  </p>
<p style=""""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/109944/files/20131002224243-sip__24.jpg?1380778963"" src="""" style=""width: 246.4939024390244px; height: 165px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/109966/files/20131002225237-sip__3.jpg?1380779557"" src="""" style=""width: 255px; height: 170px;""/></p>

<p>Our style sets us apart: we’re not stuffy about wine.  People feel comfortable asking questions and trying new varietals.  Often the wine becomes the entertainment for the evening.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently, no online wine retailers are able to offer what we
can.  Our trained SIP! wine experts
choosing amazing wines, preparing educational materials, and packaging all of
the intricacies needed for a wine tasting party.  Four years and a myriad of wine events have
prepared us for breaking into this niche market.</p>
<p><b>What’s in
the box?</b></p>
<p>1. 5 different bottles of delicious wine</p>
<p>2. Tasting note cards for each guest</p>
<p>3. SIP wine opener</p>
<p>4. E-SOMM DVD</p>
<p><b>A little more detail...</b></p>
<p style="""">1. For each SIP! in a BOX, our wine experts select five bottles of
wine that are not only delicious, but work well together when tasted in a progressive flight.  Moreover, the wines in each box will be selected to suit a unique theme.  The options are endless, but some examples of themes would be: all Pinot Noirs from
different regions showing off how this sexy grape can range in flavors…or all
California Chardonnays…or a What is a Bordeaux Blend? flight, etc.  </p>
<p style="""">2. In addition to the wine, customers receive
everything they need to throw their own SIP! event including tasting note cards which guests can use to take notes on the wines they are tasting.</p>
<p style="""">3. We will include a high quality SIP wine opener so you can open your wines in style.</p>
<p>4. Clients tell us over and over that our casual presentation and approachability
set our events apart from others.  So,
how do we include this style in a SIP! in a BOX?  We’re really excited to offer something <i>else</i>
that is not being done.  Inside each SIP!
in a  BOX is a video that hosts can play
on their TV or laptop during the tasting event. 
Wine experts will walk the group through the flight, offer information
on the wines and spark great wine conversations for the group. We call it an
E-SOMM.  Guests will feel like their very
own sommelier is walking them through the flight while sitting in their living
room with friends or mingling with coworkers at the office.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>What
We Need </b></p>
<p>Like most start-up
companies, in order to expand we need funds to build our growing infrastructure.  We’ve already laid the groundwork for the
launch of SIP! in a BOX, however we still need $19,900 to build a
safe and trusted e-commerce site, invest in marketing and advertising, and
cover initial fees associated with warehouse rental and insurance.</p>
<p>Your contribution is the
only way that we can launch this exciting new business venture.</p>
<p><b>What
You Get</b></p>
<p>Your contribution is a BIG help for us AND there are

Since 2009 SIP! events has been successfully curating casual,
entertaining, and informative wine parties in homes and offices across Southern
California.  Now, we’re ready to package
our unique approach to wine education and events in, well, a box.  SIP! in a BOX will offer wine enthusiasts
across the country the opportunity to purchase our best-selling wine flights from our online wine shop.




More than 4
years of successful wine events
Our clients count on us to offer something special for their
guests who want to learn about wine in a fun, approachable way. Over the past 4
years SIP! has hosted all kinds of wine events from corporate office mixers to
lively bachelorette weekends to up-scale celebrity dinner parties.  We allow our clients to enjoy the event by
handling all of the details.  We select
and research the wines according to the party’s theme and our wine expert
brings everything needed to serve and pour the wines for the party.  

  

Our style sets us apart: we’re not stuffy about wine.  People feel comfortable asking questions and trying new varietals.  Often the wine becomes the entertainment for the evening.






Currently, no online wine retailers are able to offer what we
can.  Our trained SIP! wine experts
choosing amazing wines, preparing educational materials, and packaging all of
the intricacies needed for a wine tasting party.  Four years and a myriad of wine events have
prepared us for breaking into this niche market.
What’s in
the box?
1. 5 different bottles of delicious wine
2. Tasting note cards for each guest
3. SIP wine opener
4. E-SOMM DVD
A little more detail...
1. For each SIP! in a BOX, our wine experts select five bottles of
wine that are not only delicious, but work well together when tasted in a progressive flight.  Moreover, the wines in each box will be selected to suit a unique theme.  The options are endless, but some examples of themes would be: all Pinot Noirs from
different regions showing off how this sexy grape can range in flavors…or all
California Chardonnays…or a What is a Bordeaux Blend? flight, etc.  
2. In addition to the wine, customers receive
everything they need to throw their own SIP! event including tasting note cards which guests can use to take notes on the wines they are tasting.
3. We will include a high quality SIP wine opener so you can open your wines in style.
4. Clients tell us over and over that our casual presentation and approachability
set our events apart from others.  So,
how do we include this style in a SIP! in a BOX?  We’re really excited to offer something else
that is not being done.  Inside each SIP!
in a  BOX is a video that hosts can play
on their TV or laptop during the tasting event. 
Wine experts will walk the group through the flight, offer information
on the wines and spark great wine conversations for the group. We call it an
E-SOMM.  Guests will feel like their very
own sommelier is walking them through the flight while sitting in their living
room with friends or mingling with coworkers at the office.

  

What
We Need 
Like most start-up
companies, in order to expand we need funds to build our growing infrastructure.  We’ve already laid the groundwork for the
launch of SIP! in a BOX, however we still need $19,900 to build a
safe and trusted e-commerce site, invest in marketing and advertising, and
cover initial fees associated with warehouse rental and insurance.
Your contribution is the
only way that we can launch this exciting new business venture.
What
You Get
Your contribution is a BIG help for us AND there are
awesome benefits in store for you as well! 


We are offering personalized wine consultations over the
phone; an invitation to a special SIP donor wine and cheese party where we will
sample some amazing wines together; and the VIP donors will receive their own

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As more and more people come online new ways of staying in contact with each other have surfaced.  The downside of this though is that although we are more virtually connected, we have become disconnected in our physical world. In many ways we have become disconnected from our own communities.  Our aim is to bring the human connection back by uniting local communities through sharing with the people around us while at the same time making the planet a greener place.</p>
<p>We want to create a global sharing platform for people to come together within their local communities and share things with each other. We will make this possible by providing a safe and trusted platform by connecting the current reach of Social Networking profiles, Product sharing, Feedback ratings and in turn develop a Personal Reputation rating system through a combination of Verified Profiles, Product sharing reviews, Feedback and eventually a marketplace where to share your expertise and services.</p>

<p>Tutums aims to offer a unique platform to allow individuals to contribute to a community of sharing. Through ID verification, reputation, and exchange metrics we aim to develop a platform where people we share things, time, and expertise while coming together and becoming a more active part of their offline communities. Tutums will encourage sharing by rewarding a profile the more it shares and offering a credit based system every time we share. We want to become an online community of exchange and personal interaction.</p>
<p>Tutums also aims to build personal online reputations and to eventually provide an exchange marketplace of expertise. It picks up where social media stops and completes the link that unites communities and makes us come together like never before.</p>
<p>The reason to crowd fund Tutums is because it not only helps to gauge interest in a project like this, but it gives an opportunity for funders to be part of the Tutums community from the very beginning.

<p>Musana Jewelry is a non-profit organization that works with women in Lugazi, Uganda to design, produce, and sell beautiful jewelry, both in Uganda and in the United States. Musana identifies women with whom to work in at-risk populations, such as single mothers and women who are HIV-positive, who are in the greatest need and are determined to create a better life for themselves and their children.</p>
<p>Employment with Musana means developing self-reliance through consistent employment. A full-time job with Musana results in economic stability, the opportunity to gain marketable and transferable skills, and the option of supplemental English, health, and business education, which together lead to empowered individuals who become leaders in their community. Musana is a spark of opportunity that powers the growth of individuals, their families, and everyone else the artisans’ light touches. </p>
<p><strong>THIS CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>With the incredible opportunity for increased production over the past eight months, Musana has been able to hire more women and collaborate with more women’s groups in Lugazi Town. We want to expand our social services to meet this growth, so our holiday giving campaign is an effort to cover the funding costs for the first six months of 2013. </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Contributions will have a direct impact on improving the quality of life of the artisans Musana works with, including professional English instruction and a business development class of each artisan’s choice. It is the implementation of these programs that will have the truly profound effect of opening doors of opportunity for each woman and her children.</p>
<p>We have already seen shy, quiet artisans blossom into outgoing leaders with the help of English instruction and the confidence gained from building your own business. Even what seems like a relatively minor offering, such as being able to provide a two-hour workshop on contraception, can upend destructive local tall tales about the dangers of birth control and provide women with the tools to take control of their bodies and reproductive cycles. For Musana, providing social support for our artisans isn’t the icing on the cake, it is the fundamental reason for our existence.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>With the six-month budget we’ve created, we plan to make vital improvements to our social services programs, in everything from hiring a highly trained English teacher, to subsidizing the artisans’ children’s school fees and providing internet access to improve computer literacy.</p>
<p>Musana’s 6-month wishlist:</p>
<p>English teacher training: $100</p>
<p>6-month English teacher salary: $192</p>
<p>English learning materials for 10 women: $50</p>
<p>6 months of internet: $720</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6-month health instructor fee: $72</p>
<p>50 treated mosquito nets: $220</p>
<p>10 business training classes: $480</p>

<p>Nursery school fees for 6 children: $162</p>
<p>Primary school fees for 13 children: $367</p>

<h3>Lambda Recovery Weekend</h3>
<div>    Lambda was created over ten years ago as a way to bring men and women in the GLBT community together to celebrate their recovery.  There had always been retreats for sober men and women separately, and Lambda wanted to change that.</div>
<div>    Each year we work all year as a committee to fundraise and plan a very special three day long retreat at the beautiful Camp Stevens in Julian, California.  We offer a weekend full of learning, growth, spirituality, recovery, bonding, and creating new friendships.  We strive to create a weekend that is not only memorable, but creates life long friendships.  Each year we struggle to raise enough money to pull it off, sometimes reaching into our own pockets, but we always do somehow.  </div>
<div>    This year we need to replace some essential items that we used to borrow from another group, that we just don't have the funding for.  We are a very low budget group, and trying to raise money for additional items is difficult.  We need coolers, lighting, bins for storage, flags, flag poles, and misc. storage goods.  After we pay for the essentials we need we will use the additional monies for scholarships.</div>
<div>    Every year we invite people from a recovery home that we partner with to apply for a scholarship to attend the weekend retreat.  In exchange for the scholarship they volunteer their time to help make the retreat happen.  Every year we are able to grant scholarships to every person that applies.  We would love to be able to do that again this year.</div>
<div>  Personally Lambda has changed my life.  I have been a part of the organizing committee for three years, and the success of the retreat is incredible important to me.  Your contribution will help make that an attainable goal for me personally, and help allow a person, perhaps newly clean &amp; sober, realize that life in sobriety can be amazing.  </div>
<div>   You can personally impact a persons sobriety by contributing to our campaign.  Please help us make Lambda 2013 the best retreat ever!</div>

<p><b>Eastwick is an eco-conscious salon
with a purpose. What does that mean? A few things…</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><u>Our Environment &amp; Service Standard:</u></p>
<p>Eastwick is a salon designed with a literary theme. The
aesthetic of which is an amalgamation of vintage apothecary meets English
study. We will be a haven, a space where you will not only receive exceptional
services, but have an experience that is tailored to you, our guest. Welcomed
upon entering, you can expect a level of service akin to the Four Seasons set
in an intimate, mom and pop atmosphere. All of our services will have an added
value experience, compliments of Eastwick Salon. Receive a scalp massage prior
to your haircut, warm towel foot wrap with color treatments and men’s services
will come with a second rinse and warm towel face wrap. Should you prefer your coffee black with a morning service, enjoy quietly reading or want to be in and out, we will discover that about you, take note and apply it to your future services. <br/></p>
<p>Our salon will use
and sell industry leading products. Products that are environmentally friendly and
produced by ethically responsible companies who share our vision for the
future of our industry.</p>
<p>We also look forward to hosting annual customer appreciation
events, during which we’ll have giveaways, complimentary add-on services, nibbles and cocktails. You’ll
be celebrated! Inside our walls everyone is a VIP.<br/></p>
<p><u>Local Partnerships &amp; Philanthropy:</u></p>
<p>At Eastwick we believe in community and plan to support ours
through local partnerships and philanthropy. </p>
<p>Let’s talk partnerships. So, we plan to serve alcohol. In
doing so, why not help the local microbrew get established by pouring their beer?
The same goes for carrying local wines. We will serve nibbles, at least on the
weekends. Croissants from the local patisserie on a Saturday morning alongside
a mimosa…not a bad way to start your day and service!</p>
<p>Aside from local partnerships, we are excited to have the
opportunity to give back to our community. In house fund raising through
raffles (where all proceeds go to a local charity or program) is just one small
and simple approach. However, we will be hosting one or two annual events as
well. For example, our team could provide back to school cuts for lower income
kids. We’d promote the event for a month prior offering our clients a discount
on retail purchases in exchange for school supplies. Working as a team to bring
our skill set and services can benefit so many groups…Dress for Success, Ronald
McDonald House and more!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What your support means to us and how we'll use it…</b></p>
<p>By contributing to Eastwick Salon, you are helping to
establish a small business where we don’t just cater to you, but our community
as well. You will enable a team of people who aren’t just talented, but
committed to our culture and standards. Professionals who give a damn and give back. Folks ready to change
the industry from the inside out and raise the next generation of stylists,
leading by example and through mentorship. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In choosing the “flexible funding"" option, our goal is to raise as
much money as possible to be used as capital in obtaining a business loan.
If we happen to exceed our goal, even better! While this campaign runs, we will utilize the funds we presently possess to begin forming our company. Our business lawyer will draft a partnership
agreement, our logo will be developed, website created and
business plan polished up and readied for presentation. <br/>
</p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>A little more about us...</b><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Eastwick salon will have two co-owners. There’s myself, Robin Salas and my business partner. Out of respect for her current employer, and
in an effort to keep her gainfully employed, she will remain behind the
scenes for the time being. However, I can tell you all about her, what we bring
to the table and how we will both contribute to running Eastwick Salon.</p>
<p><u>My Business Partner:</u>
</p>
<b></b><p>She has been in the industry since 2001, first working as a
salon coordinator while getting her undergraduate degree. I met her in 2004, when
she was the assistant manager at the salon where I completed my apprenticeship.
She has since gone on to hold a Salon Manager/Director of Operations position at
a very well respected salon here in Seattle. Along with continued
education in regard to our industry and customer service, she is thoughtful,
leads by example and has cultivated her own relationships with many respected
individuals and vendors in our community.</p>
<p><u>Myself, Robin Salas:</u>
</p>
<b></b><p> I have been in the industry since 2002, first as a salon coordinator and behind the chair since 2004 upon completing my apprenticeship. I've been an educator and mentor throughout my career, staying current on salon trends and technical skills by routinely furthering my own education. I am passionate about providing customized services geared toward each individual's needs and understand that superior customer service stems not only from cultivating relationships and building trust, but by providing outstanding services and exceeding expectations.<br/></p>
<p><u>Division Of Responsibilities:</u>
</p>
<p>Robin Salas<i>, Owner/Stylist/Marketing
&amp; Education Director</i></p>
<p>In addition to remaining behind the chair, I will assist in

</div><br/></div>","Eastwick is an eco-conscious salon
with a purpose. What does that mean? A few things…

Our Environment & Service Standard:
Eastwick is a salon designed with a literary theme. The
aesthetic of which is an amalgamation of vintage apothecary meets English
study. We will be a haven, a space where you will not only receive exceptional
services, but have an experience that is tailored to you, our guest. Welcomed
upon entering, you can expect a level of service akin to the Four Seasons set
in an intimate, mom and pop atmosphere. All of our services will have an added
value experience, compliments of Eastwick Salon. Receive a scalp massage prior
to your haircut, warm towel foot wrap with color treatments and men’s services
will come with a second rinse and warm towel face wrap. Should you prefer your coffee black with a morning service, enjoy quietly reading or want to be in and out, we will discover that about you, take note and apply it to your future services. 
Our salon will use
and sell industry leading products. Products that are environmentally friendly and
produced by ethically responsible companies who share our vision for the
future of our industry.
We also look forward to hosting annual customer appreciation
events, during which we’ll have giveaways, complimentary add-on services, nibbles and cocktails. You’ll
be celebrated! Inside our walls everyone is a VIP.
Local Partnerships & Philanthropy:
At Eastwick we believe in community and plan to support ours
through local partnerships and philanthropy. 
Let’s talk partnerships. So, we plan to serve alcohol. In
doing so, why not help the local microbrew get established by pouring their beer?
The same goes for carrying local wines. We will serve nibbles, at least on the
weekends. Croissants from the local patisserie on a Saturday morning alongside
a mimosa…not a bad way to start your day and service!
Aside from local partnerships, we are excited to have the
opportunity to give back to our community. In house fund raising through
raffles (where all proceeds go to a local charity or program) is just one small
and simple approach. However, we will be hosting one or two annual events as
well. For example, our team could provide back to school cuts for lower income
kids. We’d promote the event for a month prior offering our clients a discount
on retail purchases in exchange for school supplies. Working as a team to bring
our skill set and services can benefit so many groups…Dress for Success, Ronald
McDonald House and more!

What your support means to us and how we'll use it…
By contributing to Eastwick Salon, you are helping to
establish a small business where we don’t just cater to you, but our community
as well. You will enable a team of people who aren’t just talented, but
committed to our culture and standards. Professionals who give a damn and give back. Folks ready to change
the industry from the inside out and raise the next generation of stylists,
leading by example and through mentorship. 


In choosing the “flexible funding"" option, our goal is to raise as
much money as possible to be used as capital in obtaining a business loan.
If we happen to exceed our goal, even better! While this campaign runs, we will utilize the funds we presently possess to begin forming our company. Our business lawyer will draft a partnership
agreement, our logo will be developed, website created and
business plan polished up and readied for presentation. 


A little more about us...

Eastwick salon will have two co-owners. There’s myself, Robin Salas and my business partner. Out of respect for her current employer, and
in an effort to keep her gainfully employed, she will remain behind the
scenes for the time being. However, I can tell you all about her, what we bring
to the table and how we will both contribute to running Eastwick Salon.
My Business Partner:

She has been in the industry since 2001, first working as a
salon coordinator while getting her undergraduate degree. I met her in 2004, when
she was the assistant manager at the salon where I completed my apprenticeship.
She has since gone on to hold a Salon Manager/Director of Operations position at
a very well respected salon here in Seattle. Along with continued
education in regard to our industry and customer service, she is thoughtful,
leads by example and has cultivated her own relationships with many respected
individuals and vendors in our community.
Myself, Robin Salas:

 I have been in the industry since 2002, first as a salon coordinator and behind the chair since 2004 upon completing my apprenticeship. I've been an educator and mentor throughout my career, staying current on salon trends and technical skills by routinely furthering my own education. I am passionate about providing customized services geared toward each individual's needs and understand that superior customer service stems not only from cultivating relationships and building trust, but by providing outstanding services and exceeding expectations.
Division Of Responsibilities:

Robin Salas, Owner/Stylist/Marketing
& Education Director
In addition to remaining behind the chair, I will assist in
the general day to day running of the business. My duties will include, but are
not limited to, making a name for Eastwick in the community through
partnerships, events, social media and promotions. Supporting the new talent we bring into Eastwick Salon by establishing an apprenticeship program, as well as provide educational opportunities
for our senior staff. 
Business Partner, Owner/Director
of Operations
Aside from developing and integrating our business culture
and customer service standards, she will manage the day to day running of the business.
This includes, but is not limited to, book keeping, inventory, sales, ordering
and the hiring and training of our guest services team. 

What's in store for our staff...
It is our hope to create a space that serves our guests, community and staff. We plan to employ 5-7 hair stylists and two guest services coordinators. Through employment with Eastwick, staff can receive flexible vacation benefits, enjoy extended holiday closures, take advantage of a retirement plan and education credits. Of course our ultimate goal...Eastwick's ability to provide healthcare!

<p>Gold Crush is the creation of a group of climbers who want to see a more active climbing community in Nevada County and believe that having access to an indoor gym is the solution. Not only will Gold Crush cater to seasoned climbers, it will also teach kids responsibility, leadership, and sound climbing skills.</p>
<p>In 2015, Sierra Nevada Climbing Co-op began to pave the path with community meetings and outreach events. In order to move this vision forward we began looking at spaces for a climbing gym. In the spring of 2016, a space was acquired and that dream is now becoming a reality.</p>
<p>The phenomenal turnout at SNCC’s first preview event in June made it very clear that access to indoor climbing was shared by many more than our small core group of members and volunteers. Sierra Nevada Climbing Co-op is committed to building Gold Crush, but we cannot do so without contributions from people like you.</p>
<p>Our approach to business is collaborative and community focused. In the future, we will offer employee discounts for local businesses and will extend opportunities for education and fun to everyone in the area. This is not just another climbing gym. This is about engaging our community through our youth and retailer programs. We hope to leverage the large pool of talent that the area has to offer.  </p>
<p>With the help of your contribution, Gold Crush will be able to open its doors as the only public climbing gym in Nevada County. It is important that we not only build a place for people to come, but that we also provide an encouraging atmosphere for members and guests, including structurally sound walls and a clean environment. </p>
<p>The $30,000 that we need to raise during the Indie-Go-Go campaign will go toward start-up business, programming to start classes and establish a youth program, and construction costs.

Our Relationship</b></h2>
<b>10 years ago,</b> Shorewood High School (SHS) and Hogares Santa Maria de
Guadalupe, a children's home in Guatemala, started a fantastic relationship.  Each year in June, Shorewood High School students have the unique opportunity to travel to Hogares for 10 days. The SHS students eat, sleep and play with the children at the home, building friendships that, for many, continue even after their stay has ended.  This experience has made a significant impact on how these student travelers view themselves, their country, and the world around them.<br/><br/><p>
""Hogares"" in Spanish means ""homes."" As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of our relationship with Hogares,  we are eager to raise at least $10,000 to support the place that many of us now consider to be our home away from home. </p>
<h4>All funds raised from this campaign go to Hogares Santa Maria de Guadalupe, the children's home in Guatemala.  SHS travelers are responsible for all of their own travel expenses.  </h4>

<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>Who We Are</b></h2>
<b>HOGARES SANTA MARIA DE GUADALUPE</b>: 
a children’s home in the indigenous (Kachiquel Maya) town of Santa 
Apolonia, in rural Guatemala.  The
children’s home houses 55 children who are cared for by the home
administrators and housemothers. 
In most cases, each child has a living parent who is unable to care for 
him/her. The children attend local schools through high school.   The administrators at the home are members of the <a href=""http://www.sssf.org/SSSF/Our-Global-Impact/Latin-America/Social-Justice-and-Social-Serv.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">School Sisters of St. Francis</a>.  <br/><p><b></b></p>

<p><b>SHOREWOOD HIGH SCHOOL (SHS)</b>:<span> 
a public high school in Shorewood, WI.  Participants in the trip are typically students enrolled in

</div></div>","Our Relationship
10 years ago, Shorewood High School (SHS) and Hogares Santa Maria de
Guadalupe, a children's home in Guatemala, started a fantastic relationship.  Each year in June, Shorewood High School students have the unique opportunity to travel to Hogares for 10 days. The SHS students eat, sleep and play with the children at the home, building friendships that, for many, continue even after their stay has ended.  This experience has made a significant impact on how these student travelers view themselves, their country, and the world around them.
""Hogares"" in Spanish means ""homes."" As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of our relationship with Hogares,  we are eager to raise at least $10,000 to support the place that many of us now consider to be our home away from home. 
All funds raised from this campaign go to Hogares Santa Maria de Guadalupe, the children's home in Guatemala.  SHS travelers are responsible for all of their own travel expenses.  



Who We Are
HOGARES SANTA MARIA DE GUADALUPE: 
a children’s home in the indigenous (Kachiquel Maya) town of Santa 
Apolonia, in rural Guatemala.  The
children’s home houses 55 children who are cared for by the home
administrators and housemothers. 
In most cases, each child has a living parent who is unable to care for 
him/her. The children attend local schools through high school.   The administrators at the home are members of the School Sisters of St. Francis.  

SHOREWOOD HIGH SCHOOL (SHS): 
a public high school in Shorewood, WI.  Participants in the trip are typically students enrolled in
Spanish classes, however the trip is open to all students. Students who travel to Hogares raise their own funds for travel through other fundraising efforts.  Fundraising efforts are coordinated through the Guatemala Club at the high school.  




Why Our Campaign Is Important
Since we have had 10 fantastic years of over 300 student experiences at Hogares, current SHS students and alumni are eager to make a SIGNIFICANT DONATION to Hogares in 2015 .  WE NEED YOUR HELP.  


Our
goal is to raise $10,000 for 10 years - 10 for 10!
Your
donation will go towards  the Hogares' general budget.  Hogares currently takes care of 55 children with an annual budget of
$257,147.  That's only $4,675.00
per child per year! 

To put it into perspective, here's what your donation can provide:


$10 provides two months of tuition for a high school student.$25 provides a school uniform for an elementary student.$30 provides six months of tuition for a high school student.$60 provides food for one child for one month.$105 provides food for one child for seven weeks.$225 provides one month of black beans for the children.




Vilma graduated from high school with a specialization in tailoring.

Why is our relationship unique?  
Well, let's hear what the travelers to Hogares have to say:
I learned that the cycle of  poverty is really difficult to understand.  Since the Civil War in Guatemala, when many of the indigenous communities in the area were impacted by atrocities, it has been difficult to recover stability in these communities...  Wow, that is a lot more than I would have imagined as the need for the children's home in this area.  Isaac, SHS alum.  
I
have really learned that I have too much stuff.  Maybe I should think
about having just one drawer of clothes and taking care of them better. 
Nora, SHS
I was thrilled that I was able to spend
10 days in rural Guatemala with a whole group of kids my age and more. 
Who gets to do that on their first experience to any country?  I now
consider these kids my friends.   Sam, SHS
I
would never have imagined that I could learn to like to eat black beans.  This experience taught me so much about
food.  When you eat what is
produced locally your diet is not that varied.  But, the gusto that each child has to dig into another plate
of black beans (eaten at every meal!) with a homemade tortilla always made me think this was
gourmet food!  Ceci, SHS alum
Reading
to kids!  That was one of the big
goals during my trips to Hogares. 
When you live in a group home, you do not get the kind of attention you
would from a parent tucking you in at night.  When we pulled out the children’s books from their small
library, the typical frenzy of the Hogar came to a stand still.  What I loved was that the older kids at
Hogares joined us in reading to the younger kids.  Those were pretty magical moments.  Becky, SHS alum
                                                                           ~~~~~~~

And the current and former director at Hogares say:  
The SHS students come with their hearts in their hands and share with us so that each child is paid attention to and loved.  The children here await their visit with lots of enthusiasm and, when new students are part of their group, they are accepted as family.  Many of the children at Hogares do not see their families much or not at all.  Shorewood comes to fill that emptiness as SHS students and teachers are part of their family now.  Dora Alicia Gutierrez, current director at Hogares Santa Maria de Guadalupe

The visit from the Shorewood students to the children's home was an incentive to be in solidarity with each other:  the example of young people working together in teams, the joy of the multicultural coexistence, and the surprise of feeling so loved.   Argelina Marroquín, director at Hogares Santa Maria de Guadalupe, 1999-2012.

<h3>Our adventure so far</h3>
<div>We bought a bold pink Jeep Cherokee in December 2014. It's a great car but it needed some attention. We had to get a new engine because the old one was getting to hot. The new engine is being installed right now and we hope to get the car running smooth shortly.<br/><br/>We tried raising funds by creating a website, a Facebook-page, making alot of phone calls and sending out e-mails. We had some luck but we hope to raise a lot more money now by reaching out to the great Indiegogo community. </div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bullyhatte is a farmers community about 60 miles from the capitol Banjul. There are about 100 families living in the village. Right now they don't have acces to healthcare like most of us. There are a lot of unnecessary deaths because they do not reach the nearest hospital in time which is miles away. The people in the village are eager to start with the building of the medical post. You have to imagine that most villagers live on a budget lower then 1$ a day so what they need is a financial push. <br/><br/>By getting donations to them the construction can start and people can be treated accordingly. Diseases, accidents, pregnancies they all deserve to get medical attention.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440143519/iifc2efszxtjuhjcm4md.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div>

Our adventure starts in Haarlem, we will join up with other drivers in Antwerp, Belgium. From there the real journey starts which will take us through France, Spain, Morocco, Mauritania, Senegal and ends in Gambia.We have found a car that has lost its value in Holland but is worth a lot more in Africa.  At the end of the trip our car will be auctioned of to raise more money for the charity project we chose. Medical post for BulayhatteOur project is to build a medical post in the village Bulayhatte. There is no medical post for miles, the situation calls for immediate help. People have to travel too far which results in a lot of unnecessary deaths. We are going to make a documentary of this trip to show how three guys put their energy and their effort towards getting their message across the world and help the people in Bulayhatte.Donating to this project will make it possible for us to get there with our car. By auctioning this car of we will generate additional funds which will be added to the donations we have received so far. The funds and the donations will go directly towards the construction of the medical post.Our TeamSebastiaan Siderius- Project Initiator Sebastiaan is a entrepreneur who's goal in live is to make people smile. He wants to give to his friends, his family and everybody who wants to receive happiness en laughter. He creates business-events to let people experience certain unforgettable moments and feelings. This journey is not only a great experience for him but also for the people he's going to meet on this crazy adventure and the people who will follow the team.Dirk van Dam- Driver & MechanicDirk has always been a dreamer, and when he heard about the project in Bulayhatte, his eyes lit up. By picking the crew Dirk was insured of good travel company and people he could rely on. Dirk is a gentle soul and therefor he's a excellent companion on this journey. With allot of hours spend on getting the vehicle in good condition he will be paying attention to the mechanics.
 Michiel van der Meer- Filmmaker Michiel van der Meer is a filmmaker from Haarlem who is always looking for a good story. He joined the team to make sure that this story is told to the world. By crafting an engaging story he hopes to generate more attention for developing charity projects like thisTo find out more about his work visit: www.michielvandermeer.nlIn this video we introduce ourselves and explain about our project.



Our adventure so far
We bought a bold pink Jeep Cherokee in December 2014. It's a great car but it needed some attention. We had to get a new engine because the old one was getting to hot. The new engine is being installed right now and we hope to get the car running smooth shortly.We tried raising funds by creating a website, a Facebook-page, making alot of phone calls and sending out e-mails. We had some luck but we hope to raise a lot more money now by reaching out to the great Indiegogo community. 




The Impact
Bullyhatte is a farmers community about 60 miles from the capitol Banjul. There are about 100 families living in the village. Right now they don't have acces to healthcare like most of us. There are a lot of unnecessary deaths because they do not reach the nearest hospital in time which is miles away. The people in the village are eager to start with the building of the medical post. You have to imagine that most villagers live on a budget lower then 1$ a day so what they need is a financial push. By getting donations to them the construction can start and people can be treated accordingly. Diseases, accidents, pregnancies they all deserve to get medical attention.

<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>Though Ophelia's Gypsy Caravan tends to use the ""royal we"" when referring to itself (it sounds more professional that way), the truth is that the business is and has always been operated by one person: a 31 year-old young adult fantasy writer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I (Hanna Howard) graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English and Creative Writing in 2008, and while I have pursued professional novel writing ever since, I've also had an irrepressible doodling habit that, shortly after college, manifested itself in the painting of literary quotes and whimsical designs on ceramic coffee cups.</p>
<p>In 2010, I caved to the pressure of a good friend and opened an Etsy shop. Etsy was still pretty new at the time, and I didn't expect it to lead to much, but to my happy surprise, I found that the things I posted tended to sell, and gradually the business grew. It grew and grew and grew, and in 2015 I made the shift into full-time painting, no longer holding any other outside jobs. </p>
<p>That same year, I also signed with a literary agent and began revising my book to rigorous new standards, working toward publication.</p>
<p>What I discovered in the course of the following year was that, within the time limitations of each week, and the balance of painting, shipping, business management, and writing, I could generate enough income to just barely, <i>barely</i> sustain myself and the business. With great reluctance, I began to consider moving the mug business to the back burner and seeking another ""real"" job. </p>
<p>But I hated that idea. (And not just because ""real"" jobs are the worst.) I hated it because the little family of mug supporters that had been growing on Etsy and my shop Facebook page for the last five years was incredibly dear to me, and I didn't want to let them down. I hated it because I really loved painting mugs. And I hated it because it seemed like a waste to let a perfectly good business wither away just because the current model wasn't working quite well enough.</p>
<p>And so I began to brainstorm...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>It seemed to me that what I needed most was a way to make more mugs more quickly. Traditionally, as beloved as the hand-painted designs were, I knew one of my greatest limitations was the simple fact that I could only paint so much in a year. And while it was a beautiful thing to offer a unique piece to every single person who ordered, I had always fantasized about replicating my designs with a magic wand, so I wouldn't have to paint the same thing over and over again.</p>
<p>Another problem with the hand-painted mugs was that their paint was heat-set to bond with the surface of a glaze, and did not last forever. The paint's sturdy longevity had always been impressive, but nevertheless, another of my fantasies was to produce a mug whose design would last forever, no matter how roughly or frequently you washed it.</p>
<p>And so I did some research, and discovered a printing method called sublimation. By this process, I could hand-draw or paint designs with great detail and complexity, scan them into my computer, and with the right equipment, print onto a transfer that, exposed to high temperatures within a mug press, would produce a mug with my design permanently printed on its surface. </p>
<p>With such an efficient method of production, I could spend more time creating design art, knowing that it could be used over and over again. I could market these designs more confidently, since they could be sold more than just once. And most excitingly, I could use this method to expand the business in new directions, stretching my creative muscles to more thoroughly fuse my products with the great love of my life: Story.  </p>
<p>Of course, introducing a new type of product to the Caravan would not mean the extinction of the original, hand-painted, eclectic coffee mugs; rather, it would mean that they are no longer the only option within the shop, opening up wider options for customers in both design and price.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since the Caravan is currently a ""pay the bills ONLY"" level organization, I need a bit of help getting this new endeavor off the ground. But I want to offer something back for every contribution, no matter how small. So here's the breakdown of what I need, and what you'll get back:</p>
<p><strong>Needs:</strong></p>
<p>- Mug Press: $200+*<br/>- Sublimation Printer: $200+<br/>- Heat tape: $12<br/>- Sublimation Ink ($30-$50)<br/>- Sublimation paper ($20 ish)<br/>- Pre-treated sublimation mugs ($1.50-$2 ea.): $200+<br/>- Pens and paints for high-detail paper designs ($70)</p>
<p>*The campaign is a ""flexible"" one, meaning that I can raise both more and less than my goal. You can read more about what will happen if I don't meet my goal below, but the items above which have a plus sign (+) beside them are ones whose prices range greatly on the market. Raising more than my goal will give me more flexibility in choosing good equipment.</p>
<p>Also please note that the campaign goal total also reflects the funding I will need to fulfill perks. :)</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong></p>
<p>These are outlined in greater detail on the right sidebar, but I want to offer contributors a perk even if all you can give is $5. (Every little bit counts!) So I'm offering a range of neat and weird stuff, from hand-drawn doodles and notes mailed to your door, Ophelia car and nalgene stickers, and specially recorded story readings, to the first crop of new mugs printed on the press, brand new Caravan t-shirts, and original, hand drawn designs for the sublimation printer. And what I'm maybe most excited about: the chance to have a virtual or real-life tea party with Ophelia and I while I design mugs for you and your friends! </p>
<p>Check out these mock-ups of a few of the perks! :)</p>

<p><strong>What if we can't fund the project?</strong></p>
<p>While I am hopeful that the goal number will not be too difficult to fund (especially if lots of people give in small increments!), I do know that it's possible I won't raise enough to purchase the equipment.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, I believe I can grow Ophelia's Gypsy Caravan into a shop that offers more than just a perpetually limited selection of one-time-only products. With a greater potential for growth, I hope to grant the business more stability, ensuring production of the geeky and literary mugs that have made friends around the globe, while at the same time giving myself more time to devote to those customers who still want the originality, flair, and artistic value of a hand-painted piece.</p>
<p>By supporting the Caravan in this way (and with every purchase you make!), you are helping to sustain a small business, promote art, literary awareness, and creativity, and build toward a future in which those things continue to matter. And I thank you for it!!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The risk in this endeavor is probably an obvious one: I have never before operated a sublimation mug press, and therefore, may not immediately produce a flawless result from my efforts. However, I have done lots of research, and feel I have a good grasp on how to get started. The things that will help soften the learning curve are...</p>
<p>- Good equipment. The most oft-repeated advice I have found has been to invest in a printer and press of good quality. </p>
<p>- The freedom to mess up and try again without exhausting all resources. This is why it is important to fund more than just a ""test sample"" of this equipment.</p>
<p>- Enthusiasm, patience, and support from the mug family I have grown to love so much in the last six years! Knowing you guys are behind me has always meant so much.</p>

</div></div>","A Brief History
Though Ophelia's Gypsy Caravan tends to use the ""royal we"" when referring to itself (it sounds more professional that way), the truth is that the business is and has always been operated by one person: a 31 year-old young adult fantasy writer in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I (Hanna Howard) graduated with a Bachelor's degree in English and Creative Writing in 2008, and while I have pursued professional novel writing ever since, I've also had an irrepressible doodling habit that, shortly after college, manifested itself in the painting of literary quotes and whimsical designs on ceramic coffee cups.
In 2010, I caved to the pressure of a good friend and opened an Etsy shop. Etsy was still pretty new at the time, and I didn't expect it to lead to much, but to my happy surprise, I found that the things I posted tended to sell, and gradually the business grew. It grew and grew and grew, and in 2015 I made the shift into full-time painting, no longer holding any other outside jobs. 
That same year, I also signed with a literary agent and began revising my book to rigorous new standards, working toward publication.
What I discovered in the course of the following year was that, within the time limitations of each week, and the balance of painting, shipping, business management, and writing, I could generate enough income to just barely, barely sustain myself and the business. With great reluctance, I began to consider moving the mug business to the back burner and seeking another ""real"" job. 
But I hated that idea. (And not just because ""real"" jobs are the worst.) I hated it because the little family of mug supporters that had been growing on Etsy and my shop Facebook page for the last five years was incredibly dear to me, and I didn't want to let them down. I hated it because I really loved painting mugs. And I hated it because it seemed like a waste to let a perfectly good business wither away just because the current model wasn't working quite well enough.
And so I began to brainstorm...
 
The Plan
It seemed to me that what I needed most was a way to make more mugs more quickly. Traditionally, as beloved as the hand-painted designs were, I knew one of my greatest limitations was the simple fact that I could only paint so much in a year. And while it was a beautiful thing to offer a unique piece to every single person who ordered, I had always fantasized about replicating my designs with a magic wand, so I wouldn't have to paint the same thing over and over again.
Another problem with the hand-painted mugs was that their paint was heat-set to bond with the surface of a glaze, and did not last forever. The paint's sturdy longevity had always been impressive, but nevertheless, another of my fantasies was to produce a mug whose design would last forever, no matter how roughly or frequently you washed it.
And so I did some research, and discovered a printing method called sublimation. By this process, I could hand-draw or paint designs with great detail and complexity, scan them into my computer, and with the right equipment, print onto a transfer that, exposed to high temperatures within a mug press, would produce a mug with my design permanently printed on its surface. 
With such an efficient method of production, I could spend more time creating design art, knowing that it could be used over and over again. I could market these designs more confidently, since they could be sold more than just once. And most excitingly, I could use this method to expand the business in new directions, stretching my creative muscles to more thoroughly fuse my products with the great love of my life: Story.  
Of course, introducing a new type of product to the Caravan would not mean the extinction of the original, hand-painted, eclectic coffee mugs; rather, it would mean that they are no longer the only option within the shop, opening up wider options for customers in both design and price.

<p>You may be asking.... What's mead?  Mead is an ancient style of wine made from honey as opposed to traditional wine grapes.  Often mead is made with fruits, herbs, spices and other additives.  Whats most amazing about mead is the sheer enormity of flavors you can create.  We've made Key Lime Pie, Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly, Strawberry Rhubarb Pie, Chocolate Coconut, Mixed Berry, Fruit Punch and this list goes on and on.  With mead you are truly limited only by your own imagination.  What's also remarkable is that mead is often organic and gluten free making it a product with universal appeal.  </p>
<p>I fell in love with mead in 2014 after trying some amazing mead made by a master meadmaker in Ferndale, Michigan.  It was a life altering experience for me and after my first sip I knew I had to have more.  So I set off to do just that, at which point I ran into a small problem.  There simply are not many meads available commercially and the amazing Ferndale meads were not available outside of Michigan.  At which point I had to make a decision, go without this amazing beverage or learn to make my own.  </p>
<p>It was this decision to make my own which spawned Garagiste Meadery.  As mead makers we've made every effort to keep our product local by sourcing our honey from local beekeepers and to the extent possible our fruits from local farmers.  In this we've tried to bring the farm to table experience into a single bottle.  Since we began meadmaking we've made hundreds of gallons and shared it with hundreds of people.  We've attended mead events and festivals and the response is overwhelmingly positive.  Independent raters from across the globe on services like Untappd rate our meads among the best available.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a commercial Meadery focused on small batch artisanal meads and honey wines.  We want to make explosive and inspired meads and share them with you and indeed the world.  We are reaching out to you to help us make our dream come true.</p>

</div><div> <p>We are aiming to collect $50,000 or more.  The process of building a winery or meadery requires numerous permits and these applications often take months to complete.  The money raised during this campaign will be used to secure a modest sized industrial space for our Meadery/Tasting Room and the equipment necessary to produce the quality of mead that we wish to offer.   Any additional monies generated will be used for necessary renovations and to keep our leases paid during this interim period where we wont be able to produce mead or generate revenue.  It's a long road but we are committed to seeing it through!</p>
<p>So what do you get?  We've set up a number of options to choose from to suit any taste or budget.</p>
<p>Our lowest cost options include some pretty awesome swag made by some pretty awesome people.  A simple set of stickers for you to display for $5.  Our Garagiste shirt is a premium tee with durable screen printing inks.  The Garagiste glassware is a superb drinking vessel that's equally well suited to be used with a mead or a fine whiskey.  The Garagiste ""YOpener"" bottle opener is a fantastic tool made by a father/son team in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  </p>
<p>The premium perk is our Garagiste Owners Group.  This perk entitles you to a selection of premium limited release meads once we get up and running.  In addition, we'll inscribe your name/city on the walls of our tasting room.  Plus you'll also get a 10% discount on all purchases, a Garagiste Owners Group t-shirt and an invite to an Owners Group Only blowout!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>To make Garagiste Meadery a reality we will need help.  We want to build a Meadery that our community and you as a contributor can be proud of.  We want to be the peoples Meadery and in this regard we think of ourselves as publicly owned.  This is why we chose the name ""Garagiste Owners Group"".  This Meadery is going to be built by you and for you!</p>

<p>I do have the good fortune of having an Master of Business Administration behind me and a track record of success; but, I will admit that the list is daunting.  With this in mind I've partnered with some industry insiders who have opened meaderies and wineries and they've been generous enough to offer their assistance.  The mead community is a small one but the people are great!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We fully recognize that some people cannot contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li> <li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

I do have the good fortune of having an Master of Business Administration behind me and a track record of success; but, I will admit that the list is daunting.  With this in mind I've partnered with some industry insiders who have opened meaderies and wineries and they've been generous enough to offer their assistance.  The mead community is a small one but the people are great!   Other Ways You Can Help We fully recognize that some people cannot contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p>Hello loyal and potential customers!  I am Joe Trojak - creator, chef, and owner of Monster Joe's Sauces. </p>
<p>Monster Joe's is my own line of signature BBQ and buffalo wing sauces.  These are my own original BBQ and buffalo wing recipes with some unique spice levels. Wherever you cook your meats - in the kitchen, on the backyard grill, in the backyard smoker, or on the tailgate grill, my sauces are the perfect flavor compliment because they do not overpower the natural flavor of beef, pork, chicken, and even fish.  Yup - you read that right! My buffalo wing sauces are the perfect condiment for even eggs, mac-n-cheese, or even to personalize your own version of buffalo chicken dip! </p>
<p><b>Monster Joe's Philosophy</b></p>
<p>As a consumer, you spend top dollar for your beef, pork, chicken, even fish and seafood. So why use a mass produced, under-performing sauce?  Your meat, poultry and seafood needs premium sauces with natural ingredients, that are gluten free. Sauces made in taste controlled small batches to ensure quality and the perfect combinations of flavors. All of our products are produced, and bottled, right here in Philadelphia - made in the U.S.A!</p>
<p>I come to you today seeking your help in the launch of my lifelong passion and vision, providing the best BBQ and buffalo wing sauces.  As my company expands, I have a list of new products I will be launching.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My dream is simple, to do what I like as a job.</p>
<p>Hi my name is Joyce, born and raised in Singapore. I had been working on IT job for the past 8 years only to realize one thing; I do not like it and I'm not good at it either. So at the age of 32, I decided to pursue my own dreams.</p>
<p>I loved craftwork since young and for the past year, I started making jewellery and accessories containing real plants. I have been selling them on several online stores but the sales is not nearly enough to be considered a real job. What I lack is branding and awareness.</p>
<p>After tweaking around with product descriptions, social media accounts without much results, I believe I need to invest on advertising and branding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am not having enough sales to cover the cost incurred hence, unable to invest further on plans to raise product and brand awareness. Your help and donation can help make this come true.</p>
<p>I will mail different series of my product to you based on the amount donated. Essentially you will not be donating for nothing!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Plans I have with the collected funds:</p>
<p>-advertising for products in online stores platform and social media account. <br/>- hire professional agencies for branding and product awareness <br/>-photography fees, mostly already paid for but unable to engage for new projects/products.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basically online advertising is to place my items at the very top when buyers search for products similar to mine, I scrolled past 15 pages without seeing my own item and those on top tend to have the word 'Ad' on it so..obvious isn't it, need to pay to be on top. I will start with the lowest amount allowed for the ad so as not to overspend since I am not sure how effective it is to start with</li>
<li>Branding and Product awareness is a big thing which I will probably plan it slow and ask for more advice before I dump in the money. </li>
<li>Photography is certainly the next step I can invest on to continue providing great images and concept shots to entice buyers. Though the photographer is my best friend, it is his livelihood after all and I cannot always take advantage without filling his rice bowl ya?</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Do share my instagram account @thegreenjewels with your friends who might like my line of products and hopefully they will support me too! Should they not be keen to donate, they might simply like what I sell and buy it online, that is gonna help me too! </p>

Do you remember the anticipation you’d feel
throughout the chilly, rainy, days of late fall -- eagerly waiting for the day
when your parents would finally give in to your nagging, bundle you up in a
warm coat and take you downtown to see the incredible, animated displays in
department store windows? 
 
            You
would huddle with family, friends, and complete strangers, noses pressed
against the plate glass window, and gaze in wonder as Santa and his elves,
Victorian store keepers, moving model trains, and fairytale figures, gestured
and twirled across winter landscapes, and cheerful family settings.  It was a magical treat for young and
old in cities all across the country.
 
         Well,
a whole generation of kids never had that experience.  And, the Sacramento County Historical Society wants to
provide if to them.  With your help
we’ll recreate a full-sized holiday display window, using animated
figures that once graced the windows of the Breuner’s department store in
downtown Sacramento. 
 
         The display will occupy
the window of the former Roos Bros. department store building at 1001 K Street,
the corner of 10th and K. Setup will take place during November 2010, with a “grand
reveal”
of the completed display the day after Thanksgiving, November 26, at noon. The display
will remain in place until the first week of January, 2011. 
 
            The
theme for the 2010 Holiday Display Window is “Winter in the City,” an urban scene set in
downtown Sacramento about 1910. Store windows containing period gifts and
merchandise, a nickelodeon movie theater, and lighted architectural elements
will reflect the holiday season. Animated Gaffney Display Company figures will
interact with each other and their surroundings. We also hope to recreate the
sense of wonder of holiday seasons past.
           
The Impact

           
         We hope this celebration of K Street’s past can also serve to inspire its future and encourage other cities across the country – and not just those big cities in the Midwest like Chicago, Philadelphia and New York, to do the same.

What We Need & What You Get
(Sacramento County Historical Society is
organizing the fundraising effort, and our volunteers will build the display.
In addition to starting funds provided by SCHS and several private contributors
and local nonprofits, we have collected over 85% of our $10,000 funding goal,
but we need your help to bring a piece of local history back to life.
 
Please consider a tax-deductible donation to
this project
 


$25: Window Shopper Level contributors will have
their names listed on the Grand Reveal event program and receive a set of two
full-color photographic postcards of the 2010 Holiday Display window.
 
$100: Contributor Level contributors will have
their names listed on the event program and a panel at the Holiday Display
site, receive a one-year membership in the Sacramento County Historical Society
(existing members will have their memberships extended by a year), the postcard
set and a copy of the Sacramento History Journal Vol. 5 No. 2-4 featuring
photos of Breuner’s and Weinstock & Lubin holiday displays and essays on
the history of Sacramento’s department stores.
 
$250: Helper Level contributors will have
their names listed on the event program and a panel at the Holiday Display
site, receive the postcard set and a copy of the Sacramento History Journal

<p> </p>
<p>The Setting</p>
<p> </p>
<p>New technology makes today’s publishing industry a paradise of opportunity for a small, nimble publisher like us. In this Indiegogo campaign, <strong>we’re asking you to help us take advantage of an awesome opportunity to expand our innovative business model</strong>—<strong>so we can publish more extraordinary writers!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Backstory</p>
<p>The big, traditional publishing houses have been acquired by corporate parents and can’t afford to take risks on new talent the way they used to. Advances to even well-known writers are getting smaller and traditional distributors are taking up to 70% of a book’s profit to move paper around the world. Not so good for authors, established or new.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Concept</p>
<p><strong>The idea behind Water Street Press is to provide readers with beautiful, provocative books that are too ‘literary’ or too ‘niche’ or even too ‘dangerous’ for established publishers to take a risk on</strong>—and to do it while providing our writers some of the highest royalty rates in the industry. We use newer, and greener, ways to produce, distribute, and market books—and by that I mean both e-books, and print editions.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Water Street Press is not a self-publisher – not that there’s anything wrong with that. What we are is a small independent press that does everything an old-timey publisher would do: rigorous editing, pristine copyediting, gorgeous original covers—<strong>but when we do it, the one person who makes the most money from the whole process is the creator of the story: the author her- or himself</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Authors</p>
<p><strong>Joyce Carol Oates</strong> calls one of our authors ‘wonderfully readable’ and ‘richly informed.’</p>

<p>These are the kinds of writers you love to read—and we love taking risks for. </p>
<p>           </p>
<p>The Plot Twist</p>
<p><strong>Now Water Street Press has been offered a stunning opportunity.</strong> Our publishing model looks really good to some folks who hold the electronic rights to a few hundred backlist titles – books that are already written, edited and published as print books, but that haven’t yet been put into a digital format and released as ebooks.  Backlisted books that enjoy some level of evergreen, on-going sales, which means that <strong>a publisher like us can move forward with ever-increasing stability</strong>. Growing our list from twenty to over two hundred books in a short period of time means that we can afford to take more risks on more authors of more and more powerfully beautiful, provocative books—and <strong>put those books in your hands and on your e-readers.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Happy Ending</p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in.</strong>  Each backlist book is a whole lost less expensive to produce than an original manuscript. But it’s still not free. </p>
<p>            We’re hoping to raise at least $5000 so that we can begin publishing the backlist, allowing us a bit of financial breathing room in the short term, while we build our own original catalog, so we can continue to fund and develop new writing talent and publish the books that the establishment ignores.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks so much for caring about good books—for being an avid reader, and for considering becoming a part of Water Street Press.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can give any amount, it doesn't have to fit neatly into one of the perks, and you are free to choose any perk up to the amount you have contributed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p><em>If you want to help but can't afford to contribute, that's fine! There are other things you can do if you’re a reader who is passionate about good books. For example, use the other buttons to share the campaign on Facebook or via email, word of mouth, or any other way you can get the word out to readers you think might be interested in helping some damned good writers get their words in print. </em></p>

Our publishing model looks really good to some folks who hold the electronic rights to a few hundred backlist titles – books that are already written, edited and published as print books, but that haven’t yet been put into a digital format and released as ebooks.  Backlisted books that enjoy some level of evergreen, on-going sales, which means that a publisher like us can move forward with ever-increasing stability. Growing our list from twenty to over two hundred books in a short period of time means that we can afford to take more risks on more authors of more and more powerfully beautiful, provocative books—and put those books in your hands and on your e-readers.
 
The Happy Ending
This is where you come in.  Each backlist book is a whole lost less expensive to produce than an original manuscript. But it’s still not free. 
            We’re hoping to raise at least $5000 so that we can begin publishing the backlist, allowing us a bit of financial breathing room in the short term, while we build our own original catalog, so we can continue to fund and develop new writing talent and publish the books that the establishment ignores.
Thanks so much for caring about good books—for being an avid reader, and for considering becoming a part of Water Street Press.
 
You can give any amount, it doesn't have to fit neatly into one of the perks, and you are free to choose any perk up to the amount you have contributed. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to help but can't afford to contribute, that's fine! There are other things you can do if you’re a reader who is passionate about good books. For example, use the other buttons to share the campaign on Facebook or via email, word of mouth, or any other way you can get the word out to readers you think might be interested in helping some damned good writers get their words in print. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It's easy to see everyone as separate. A bit like two lines heading in opposite directions. But here's a cool perspective trick: if we think about it just a little differently, it's easy to see everyone as moving in parallel. And at Ollibean, we love thinking in parallels. When we start to have conversations about abilities that separate us, we'll start to realize that the abilities we have in common are much stronger. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are working towards a world of global inclusion. That means everyone gets a fair shot at education through inclusion in their schools and communities, regardless of their physical abilities or ability to speak. OlliNepal is Ollibean's first international initiative to enable inclusion. 100% of the funds raised will go towards supplying technology to assist communication and education, and to provide area medical professionals with education on new physical therapy techniques.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have chosen to work with OLENepal to provide type to talk devices to the schools, along with therapy education and assistance in Nepal's Kathmandu region. Each device can give a child with a communication disability the opportunity to have their voice heard for the first time. Enabling communication can be the difference between providing a child a fulfilling life, equal opportunity for education and inclusion in their community, and your small donation can give them this incredible gift.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this link with others or visit <a href=""http://www.ollibean.com/nepal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ollibean.com/nepal</a> to learn more about our cause. In addition to supporting via IndieGoGo, for every person who signs up for an Ollibean account, we will donate an additional $2 to the OlliNepal efforts. We have zero overhead for this initiative so 100% of the money raised will go directly towards making a difference in Nepal.</p>

<p>Hey everyone, the 4 of us (Josh Marsie, Simon Mills, Marybeth Werkmeister, Pat Peret) have been checking out an empty store front in downtown Pawcatuck. We got to thinking since all of us are heavily involved in different hobbies, i.e. collecting records, comic books, gaming, etc., then maybe we already have enough stock to start this thing. Plus we already have a few people that are going to keep their arcade games there for everyone's usage. <br/>A large point in doing this is making a community spot where people can actually come hang out and indulge different interests. <br/>We were originally looking at this 1800 square foot place, then the guy who owns it has us all come down in person just to say ""nevermind, I don't want this here."" Pretty huge let-down. So we have begun looking at several other spots that are unclaimed in Westerly/ Pawcatuck (believe me, there's plenty). Plus side-- most of these spots are about half as cheap on rent (about $400 to $600 a month). Downside-- probably won't be able to do our original idea of throwing D.I.Y. shows as well due to the downgrade in available square feet. Either way, gaming is still going to happen and it will still be right in downtown.<br/>A few things we already have lined up:<br/>-large amount of new and used records for sale- punk, grindcore, classic rock, metal, hip hop, etc. local bands/labels, plus we distribute records from about 20 different labels internationally already<br/>-home office for local label Riotous Outburst Records (and possibly War Rhino Recs out of Danbury)<br/>-gaming tournaments (Warhammer, Magic: The Gathering, etc)<br/>-large amount of new and used comics and graphic novels for sale<br/>-soda/snacks for sale<br/>-somewhere around 2 to 4 arcade games on at all times<br/>-old school action figures for sale                                                        -DVDs, video games, consoles<br/>-people can come and put their whole collection for sale in our store on consignment</p>
<p>as far as the D.I.Y show spot for all ages stuff around here-- I'll be looking into that as a seperate entity entirely since we were denied our larger spot. Pretty lame of that landlord to lead us to believe everything would be legit at his spot and then deny us, but there's nothing we can do. People apparently dislike anything involved with kids in our community, so that needs to stop. Any help towards this goal in the downtown Pawcatuck/ Westerly area, ideas, suggestions, etc are greatly appreciated.</p></div>","Short Summary

Even with insurance picking up the larger portion of the tab, the family is still left trying to pay down a hefty balance. While both parents have returned to work to try and make up ground, finances remain a stressor for the family.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479147162/bzhl1lkh8u7g96s9gkxk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Throughout this three-year journey, Lilli’s friends and family have worked to lift Lilli’s spirits by sending stuffed owls and bearing the hashtag #lillistronger.  As simple as it is, these symbols have been a source of hope and happiness for the family on Lilli’s best and worst of days in the hospital.  </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Samaury's Story</h3><p>Few individuals hold the title of both grandson and hero, but that’s exactly what Samaury Carter is for his caretaker and grandmother, Delores Carter.

We believe treatment shouldn't be as economically debilitating as it is, and you probably agree.
Interested in placing a large order? Let us know.
  The Lilli OwlSince day one, owls have been an integral part of Lilli’s care. Whether it was simply a plush stuffed animal to cuddle when she was having trouble falling asleep in the hospital, or a symbol of strength and hope when her cancer returned, the owl will forever represent the calm among the chaos of cancer for the Hicks family.Since cancer patients have body temperatures continuously on the flux, we’ve designed the Lilli Owl using acrylic thread, a soft and cozy material with a snug fit. These socks have an athletic feel that will embrace your feet with comfort whether you are working out or relaxing.Made in North Carolina, just like Lilli. The Samaury CarterRepresenting Samaury and his battle, our first sock line features nine different colored ribbons, each symbolizing a different type of cancer. Half of net proceeds are donated to the Carter family to help them pay for expenses related to treatment.We've crafted these socks using moisture wicking technology from ultra spun polyester to keep your feet dry and comfortable whether you're at work, on the town, in the hospital, or even working out. They are crew length and sit just below the calf.Made in North Carolina, just like Samaury. Resilience Sticker Lilli Stronger: The Story of Lilli HicksBefore the evening of December 13th, 2014, Lilli Hicks was living the normal life of a 12-year-old  with her family, growing up in Greensboro, North Carolina.  But on this night, with her favorite stuffed owl by her side, she was diagnosed with ALM Leukemia.  While her parents, Travis and Lou Anne, were numb as they attempted to process everything, Lilli worried about missing school on Monday.  Three days later, Lilli began intense chemotherapy.  Over the course of the following months, Lilli would receive her treatment in-patient for 28 days at a time, go home for a few days break, and begin this process over.  Lilli had to go through this process 4 different times.  After four cycles and many sleepless hospital nights clutching to that stuffed owl, Lilli went into remission and on March 28th, 2014.  Lilli was strong enough to beat her disease, but she would have to become stronger.      Eleven months later, on February 26th , 2016, Lilli’s bloodwork showed signs that the leukemia had returned and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed with 89% blasts of immature blood forming cells in her bloodstream (normal is 5% or less).  After an intense work-up period with two more cycles of chemotherapy and every hospital test in the book, Lilli was admitted to Duke Children’s hospital on April 26th, 2016.  Enduring three days of chemotherapy at a time, following by two days of radiation, and then beginning the process over again, Lilli had to spend her days in quarantine as the intensity of the treatment weakened her immune system to near-nothing.  Finally, on May 23rd, 2016, Lilli received her transplant: cord blood donated by two different undisclosed donors.  Lilli was kept in-patient for about 6 weeks until she was strong enough to be transferred to Durham’s Ronald McDonald House on July 5th, 2016.  Even here, Lilli had to receive round-the-clock care.  She was surviving by feeding tube and tolerating never-ending blood labs and medicine pumps.  Working through the graph vs. host complications, Lilli was finally able to return to her home in Greensboro on August 29th, 2016.  Free of the feeding tube and finally stable, Lilli was delighted to be out of the hospital and back in her own house.     Today, Lilli remains under “house arrest,” meaning she can only be at home, outside in open air, or in a hospital, until her immune system becomes stronger and her graft versus host problems are fully resolved.  She is able to pursue her schoolwork online and is skyping in to her classes at her old school.  Meanwhile, the Hicks family is attempting to recover from the financial costs of almost three years of hospital bills. Even with insurance picking up the larger portion of the tab, the family is still left trying to pay down a hefty balance. While both parents have returned to work to try and make up ground, finances remain a stressor for the family.Throughout this three-year journey, Lilli’s friends and family have worked to lift Lilli’s spirits by sending stuffed owls and bearing the hashtag #lillistronger.  As simple as it is, these symbols have been a source of hope and happiness for the family on Lilli’s best and worst of days in the hospital.   Samaury's StoryFew individuals hold the title of both grandson and hero, but that’s exactly what Samaury Carter is for his caretaker and grandmother, Delores Carter. Presenting with coughing and difficulty breathing, Samaury was diagnosed in June with Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer originating in the lymphatic system. Delores Carter recalls the diagnosis “I was trying to stay strong for him, but the memory of my parents losing the fight with cancer was too fresh.” Samaury is currently undergoing chemotherapy in of his hometown Winston-Salem, North Carolina.Since Samaury’s diaper days, Delores has balanced jobs in retail and substitute teaching while she cared for Samaury, who required extra attention and resources because of his autism. She worked hard to stay afloat financially and look after her disabled grandchild, but Samaury’s cancer diagnosis upset this fine balance. Unable to work while she was shuttling Samaury to his many doctor appointments and treatments, Delores has been unemployed since June. Meanwhile, expenses continue to pile up. The majority of Samaury’s treatment is covered through Medicaid, but Delores is struggling to pay for necessities such as food, rent, and utilities.Flush with new hormones, fourteen year olds are notoriously unpleasant and self-centered. You factor in a mental disability and cancer diagnosis, Samaury has every right to be the obnoxious teenager that many of us see hanging around the mall. And yet, big-hearted and smiling wide, Samaury infectiously greets hospital staff while he tolerates treatment like the mature individual he is. “I just want people to know he has a beautiful heart and enduring spirit. He’s my hero,” says Delores. FAQQ: When will the socks be shipped?a: Backers who have selected to receive The Samaury Carter can expect their order to be shipped Thursday, 12/8. Backers who have selected to receive The Lilli Owl or some combination of both can expect their order to be shipped by 12/20, guaranteed to be delivered in 3 days or less.

<h3>Our passion for baking... </h3>
<p>As Sweet Temptations Cupcakery founder, Jakki Prince, I started baking as a little girl in the kitchen with my Nana. Growing up in my grandparents home influenced my entire life. Some of my fondest memories of my grandmother were spent baking together - me licking spoons and putting sprinkles on sugar cookies on chilly winter afternoons. </p>
<p>Since founding my business in October 2010, and first retailing cupcakes in May 2011 - my goal has been to open a storefront location for Sweet Temptations Cupcakery. Throughout the past three busy years my motivation has been sustained by the many celebrations I have been invited to bake for and by the smiling faces of families at the weekly local farmers' markets. I know residents of Guelph and area love our cupcakes because you voted! As Guelph Tribune Readers Choice Award Winners as Best Dessert and 2nd place Best Bakery, our storefront would be a welcome shop in the city.</p>
<p>A storefront location for Sweet Temptations Cupcakery would help me bring community and culture through small business to the growing south end of Guelph. The foundation of my business is unique and innovative ideas. My business has outgrown the current physical space in Aberfoyle. By supporting the campaign you will help me realize my dream of opening a storefront for our small cupcakery - so we can continue to support your families with our baking, and our local economy. </p>

Downtown St Petersburg is booming with condos and homes, and LOTS of
cooks.  However, they have no place
close by to shop for their utensils and cookware needs.  We're going to solve that problem!  

On the shoulders of our 7 years success, publishing two cookbooks, a website,
selling at boat shows, and working on outfitting lots of yachts, we are opening a store and new website that will reach, not only our boating friends, but everyone who enjoys cooking.  Building on our existing inventory of gadgets, utensils, cookware, table top and entertaining items we are adding more great cooking tools.  
We're not just another kitchen store!  Our reputation in the boating world is
stellar, with many customers returning frequently to shop with us, especially seeking us out for our knowledge, fairness of prices, and great customer service.  We carefully select our products, testing
them for durability and to be sure they work as promised.  So, when you see a product in our line, you
know it’s a great one.  We keep our prices fair and competitive, and honor our competitors list prices when we are higher.  And of course, all
the products added for the store will also be available on our website.  So, if you live in the area, stop on by once we open!  If not, the website is a great place to find all your cooking needs.  There's a link to the site below, so go check it out!  And, keep coming back to see all the new and exciting products we are adding.  www.yachtinggourmetstore.comWe're expanding the line to include items for the home cook, such as
 more small appliances, a baking section, additional cookware and even 
more table top and entertaining items.We buy from the best lines out there such as VitaMix, Chef'n, Joseph-Joseph, Red Cup Living, Govino, Mr. Ice Bucket, Krups, Microplane, Sistema,Vino2Go, just to name a few.  As an example of one of the fund new product lines we are adding, check out this campaign as well http://igg.me/at/WaveHooks/x/6719001.  It's a really fun and innovative product line!
Our store is more than just a place to shop
for that perfect cooking tool.  We have
planned a demo and education section where guest chefs and others will provide
cooking demonstrations, product demonstrations and educational programs. 

Downtown St Petersburg, FL is one of the most thriving downtown areas in the US.  And, the retail
experience is growing by leaps and bounds every day.  The Urban Galley is opening in a prime location adjacent to the marinas,condo complexes, and surrounding residental areas providing a much needed product line.
The downtown retail corridor has a population of over 40,000
and about 20,000 households.  These
numbers are on the rise with the development of new condos and homes.  And, the development of the Sundial Center
(formerly BayWalk) is expected to draw 5-7000 visitors per day.  Given the resident population, the number
of people from surrounding areas, and visitors to the area, there is a thriving
retail market, with no kitchen store!It's important for us to have a successful campaign so we can realize our dream and fill this much needed hole in the downtown shopping experience.  By funding our campaign, you can become a part of this great opportunity and receive an excellent perk in return.  
Since everything we sell will be reflected on our website, it doesn't matter where you live.  Everyone will benefit!   What We Need and What You'll Get
We need your help in raising the funds to complete our
store.  Your contribution will go toward the following:
1. 
Secure
our space in a high traffic downtown shopping area.  Our broker is currently identifying and finalizing lease agreements. 
2. 
Build out the space, including fixtures, painting, flooring and lighting.
3. 
Add additional products to our existing
inventory to round out the product line for our expanded focus.  80% of our inventory is currently in the warehouse.  Funding will go toward expanding the inventory in order to open with the right mix for the new market.4.  Implement international shipping on the website with the funding going toward the acquisition of the necessary software.  
5. 
GET THE WORD OUT!  We are using social media as our primary media but also planning campaigns focused on the downtown residents and surrounding areas.  We are also implementing a program to partner with yacht brokers and real estate agents. 
In exchange for your contribution, you will receive a fantastic perk from us!  Please see the list of Perks for more detail. If you can't contribute, we understand.  You can still help us by sharing our campaign with your friends on social media!  It's a simple thing that would mean soooo much to us!!!  Each time you share this campaign using the button above (just under the video), we get points from Indiegogo.  The more points we get the better the visibility on their website.  There are people all over the globe that participate in funding campaigns, so this positioning is critical to our success.  The more points we get, the better visibility our campaign receives. That greater visibility is a key to our successful campaign!                                 Stretch Goals$40,000 - Add additional products we have on the ""drawing board"" to include some 
high end cookware, a robust tabletop department (including a greater 
selection of dinnerware, flatware and drink-ware), and even more small appliances.$50,000 - Implement an aggressive advertising campaign focused on both the store and the website.  $60,000 - Expand the demonstration facility to a high-end, fully functional demonstration kitchen and education area, and implement a regular series of guest chefs and special events focused on cooking, including VIP only events (see Perks).  If we don't make our goal, all the funds will stay with the business and used to continue to develop the new website and work toward the store opening.  Referral Contest!One of the keys to our success is getting exposure on the Indiegogo.com website.  That happens when you Like and Share the campaign and someone that sees your post looks at the campaign.  Each time this happens, we get points.  The more points, the better the exposure.  To that end, we are having a referral contest!  Here's how it works:1.  Create an Indiegogo account.  It's totally private and free!2.  Right under the video above, there are share buttons for social media.  When you click on one of those buttons and share our campaign, anyone that comes to the campaign through your share will count as a referral from you.  You MUST use the buttons above to get counted.  (Sharing one of our posts within social media doesn't tie back to the contest.)3.  Share often because the person that refers the most funders to our campaign will win a prize.  The prize is a set of 12 Red Cup Living 18 ounce Cups (see picture).  These are double-walled, non-breakable, dishwasher safe versions of the iconic cup.  And, we are also including lids and straws!!  AND, a set of red cup lights!!!  All in all, a $135 value.  We will ship anywhere within the continental US for free.  Just think what a hit they will be at your next backyard, boat or any get together!  If you're not into the red cup prize, we would be happy to have you choose something else from our website!  Perk PicturesChillsner Set                                           Red Cup Lights

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We started ISSUES in June of 2007 on a whim when we couldn't find a magazine that we were looking for anywhere.  We opened the store with the intention of being a place where print could thrive and we still have that mission today.  Over the years, we have been a hub of activity, hosting events such as art shows, book readings, and parties for the community.  We are proud to be part of the Oakland landscape.</p>
<p>Even with all of the support we have received over the past eleven years, we have realized that we need to make some bold changes in order to keep ISSUES in Oakland.  We couldn't bear to throw in the towel, so luckily we have found a new location near the MacArthur BART Station in the MacArthur Annex by our friends Contact Records and Subrosa Coffee.  By moving to this new space, we will be able to begin a new era for ISSUES, where we will focus on the best magazines of each topic, as well as independent magazines of all shapes and sizes.  We will also carry a wider selection of new and used books, plus we will continue to carry the band t-shirts and greeting cards that we have become known for.</p>
<p>We want to continue to be a place where print can thrive and where the community can come to experience it in all its glory.  There are so few places where magazines are available, especially the obscure and rare ones that we specialize in.  Please help us keep these titles alive and accessible for everyone.  Help keep ISSUES in Oakland.</p>
<h3>Our Needs &amp; Your Perks</h3>
<p>In order to make this move happen we need your support.  We are moving into a store that is currently empty and just comprised of four walls.  It needs to be built out completely with custom magazine racks, book shelves, card racks, and a counter.  We then need to wrap up clean up and maintenance in our current location.  Next we need to move into our new space and get functional there.  Our total costs are $25,000 and that covers build out, moving expenses, and three months of expenses in our new location while we get on our feet, as well as Indiegogo fees.  </p>
<p>We have amazing perks to thank you for your donations!  We are offering over 40 perks from local businesses and artists that have donated towards the cause of keeping ISSUES in Oakland!  We also are offering ISSUES tote bags, ISSUES gift certificates, and a limited edition CD-R compiled by ISSUES Co-Owner Joe Colley!  </p>
<p>You may pick out as many perks as you like, all you need to do is check out separately for each unique perk.</p>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>For eleven years, we have been providing a space for the community to come and experience print media.  We don't want to see this resource go away.  Your contribution will help hold space for print in Oakland and beyond.</p>

</div></div>","Note: All
our supporters will receive their contribution back (and doubled if possible) as
soon as we reach an agreement with the automobile industry to develop and commercialize
the SRC technology. Make a wise & green investment!SRC stands for System of Reduction of
Consumption. SRC is a new energy efficient technology to cut by more
than 30% fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in all types of vehicles: cars,
motorbikes and trucks as well as electric vehicles (30% less battery use).SRC is the result of four years of research
and development in automobile engineering. The technology has been invented by Naser (Mehregan) Hasanpour and Ramin Tajarrodi. SRC is an intelligent system that maximizes
the use of kinetic energy in all vehicles. It is composed of a management
computer, switches and sensors.SRC automatically releases or engages the
wheels, cutting fuel
injection when appropriate.SRC can make a vehicle move in free wheel
mode for at least 30% of the time, greatly reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
Our Campaign
Objective
The SRC campaign objective is to
raise funds to cover the costs of the international patent application and the further development of the technology. 
Only fixed rates are predictible (around 55 000€). In such patent processess unpredictable fees might triple fixed fees. That is why our campaign objective is 150 000 USD.
The SRC
Timeline
Raised funds will cover lawyers and legal
translations as well as administrative fees of the international patent application. Fees and legal costs have been estimated by Gevers, an international law firm specialized in intellectual property rights and patents. SRC was patented in France in 2012.  Obtaining the international patent is a crucial step to ensure that this energy efficient technology is installed in all newly produced cars with no additional costs for end-consumers. 
How Does it Work? SRC
optimizes the use of kinetic energy of any vehicle. Kinetic energy is the energy that any object has due to its motion. Think
about the wheels of a bicycle or a skateboard. They
keep moving for quite a while after just a single push. That
is kinetic energy.

When you drive you are constantly injecting fuel.SRC is an intelligent system which detects when you do not need fuel to keep your speed. 
In a fraction of a second, SRC cuts fuel injection and releases the wheels. The car then coasts.
If you suddenly wish to reduce your speed or further accelerate, SRC instantly engages the wheels and the car goes back to its regular conditions. In a constant speed situation, SRC activates the free wheel mode in a fraction of a second from 25 to 120 km per hour. It re-engages the wheels as soon as you accelerate, reduce speed or make a sudden maneuver.


SRC is the only technology which optimises the vehicle's kinetic energy and is fully automatic, secure and doesn't change anything on the way you drive. 


Why 30%? How do we calculate potential savings?
We can
refer to two sources. The first is Panhard, the French car manufacturer which
free wheel system in 1930’s already reached an average savings of 20%. The
second reference is BOSCH, major industry supplier.  BOSCH recent tests showed that ‘the power of a
car engine is not necessary during 30% of the ride’. Read
BOSCH Press Release here (FR version).

Already in 1930's, the French car manufacturer Panhard demonstrated the feasability and benefits of a free-wheel car system. Read more. 

Today, car systems do not take full advantage of kinetic energy. The BMW 116d Efficient Dynamics Edition integrates a system to recuperate kinetic energy but it is far from SRC performance and it is not fully automatic. Read more. 
BOSCH, supplier of the automobile industry worldwide predicts that systems to exploit kinetic energy will be in all cars in the short term, with potential savings up to 10%. Read more. 

Specialised magazines certify that cars equipped with systems to recuperate kinetic energy is just a matter of time. Read more. 

The SRC original drawing - Access SRC full patent description. 

SRC is the technology with the highest possible performance, going far beyond BMW  systems and BOSCH predictions. 
Global Warming Needs Immediate Solutions

Before we all drive electric vehicles, we need immediate solutions to cut  pollution and costs from road vehicles. Transitional solutions such as SRC are a necessary step towards a zero emissions transport sector. 



Global
warming is a major concern and we need immediate solutions to fight climate
change. SRC is an
immediate solution to cut emissions from the highly polluting transport sector.
Our cities face
more and more pollution every day.
Today, on-road
vehicles produce over a third of total air pollution in the world. Pollution
spikes are becoming more and more frequent.
Current modes of
transport are a danger for our environment and health. It costs us millions of
barrels of fuel and of course, money.
Green technologies are crucial in tackling
global warming, from renewable energies to energy efficient devices in the
transport sector such as SRC.





Your Contribution Will Make a Big Impact
































In environmental terms, the impact of the SRC system could be impressive -reducing CO2 emissions from the highly polluting transport sector by at least 30%.






















The potential positive impact of this revolutionary, energy
efficient technology is huge in economic, social and environmental terms.

SRC cut energy costs in the transport sector by
30% without changing our habits. Not only we will spend much less in fuel at
an individual level, but the wide commercialisation of SRC will also mean
drastically decreasing public and private expenditures in energy. This
would have very positive effects in our societies as business and governments would be able
to allocate savings to employment, education, social affairs and culture
instead of oil and petrol.
Whether you drive
every day or just care about the environment, please do support SRC. Every drop counts - and so will each and
every one of your contributions.

<p>More than three million children are treated
as inpatients each year in a hospital. Medical staff is very aware that children’s emotional and behavioral
requirements are much different from that of adult patients. When children are
admitted to the hospital some feel a sense of alienation, loss of appetite,
insomnia, depression, anxiety, fear and the list goes on. A very common
occurrence for many is trying to overcome the absolute boredom that often
ensues. If you or
anyone you know has ever endured a hospitalization recovering from illness or
injury then you probably already know the kind of boring we’re talking about.
Through the eyes of a child it is even worse as days and nights seem to have

<p>Good news!
Video games have been known to provide a positive distraction for those
recovering from illness or injury. They occupy the mind with creative thinking
requiring cognitive skills replacing the boredom, depression, anxiety and anger
that is often encountered while recovering and aides in the healing process.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1199398/files/20150205120043-video_game.jpg?1423166443"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>Many hospitals already have video game
consoles and games that have been previously donated. Unfortunately, in some
cases these games are several gaming generations old. At the speed of today’s
technology that is just far too much time. What’s worse is if a game or gaming
console were to stop operating the hospital would be left in waiting hoping for
additional equipment to come their way. The Gamesgiving Foundation plans to position itself as a friend of
hospitals and their patients by providing a living library of video gaming
equipment. We want to provide video gaming equipment at no cost to hospitals to
make available to those who could use it most. When game systems break down, we
want to replace them. When new games come out, we want provide them. This will
help ensure that children recovering will have access to the latest and
greatest games while hospitalized.</p>
<p>Reaching our campaign goal will allow us to purchase a mobile video game
arcade for use at launch events. The arcade is outfitted with the latest video
game consoles and games connected together to provide an amazing gamer's
paradise. An arcade on wheels pulled up right to our partner hospitals for
launching the relationship in that area. This will also prove useful for
fundraising as we can offer video game themed parties and contests. A custom
wrap on the trailer and tow vehicle serve as a moving billboard advertising our

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Many of those
who enjoy video games only play new games for a short period of time and then
they sell or trade them in for other games. Most of the time, trade-in value
for a game is pennies on the dollar. Games that are donated to the Gamesgiving
Foundation are met with a tax receipt showing the fair market value of the game
donated. Games and equipment are then placed in a living inventory and made
available to hospitals for their patients to enjoy. Because it is a living
organization, hospitals need not worry about what to do if equipment stops
working. They also benefit by having the games rotated so there are always new
games available for playing. Just like other charitable organizations, the
Gamesgiving Foundation also makes excess games available for purchase via their
website at very reasonable rates. Multiple titles of the same games may be sold
and the profits used to purchase new games that are not currently in the
inventory.</p>
<p>Money raised through this campaign will allow us to purchase the mobile
video game trailer. Any funds raised over the campaign goal will be spent on
launching the Gamesgiving Foundation in as many areas as possible and providing
the funding source for supplying new gaming equipment or refurbishing donated equipment.</p>
<p>You get the
satisfaction of knowing that you are making a difference in the lives of those
who could use an extra boost of healing power. There are also some pretty cool
perks available for those contributing to the campaign. Helping us reach our
goal will allow us to kick off relationships at launch events and create
community giving in a way that benefits everyone. Equipment donations received
throughout the year are tax deductible providing you with an additional benefit
and reason to give.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1199426/files/20150205121334-taxcut.jpg?1423167214"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

visited, he also recalls how cold and lonely it was. The thing that stands out

<p>In recent years
our founder has had the opportunity to work with many charities across the
United States. In many cities in which he has held various events, he has been
afforded the opportunity to visit pediatric units of local hospitals. He was
determined to see the progress made since his time in recovery. He found some
good news and some bad.</p>
<p>While there is
more available today for those in a similar situation, there is still room for
improvement. Not all hospitals have video gaming equipment available for
patients. For the ones that do, it is often through donated items. Some
hospitals have been able to offer some level of video gaming entertainment but
unfortunately, the game selection is not the greatest and the technology is
quickly outdated. Plus, should a gaming console quit working or a game become
unusable they are left hoping for a future donation. This can change. This

<p>Another
challenge is to effectively change the way we normally do things. Many people
trade in or sell their unused video gaming equipment to finance purchasing
newer equipment. Too many times they are receiving pennies on the dollar for
their equipment. We have to challenge each other to think larger than

the fair market value tax deduction that can be realized will significantly

<p><b>Risks</b></p>
<p>There are a few

More than three million children are treated
as inpatients each year in a hospital. Medical staff is very aware that children’s emotional and behavioral
requirements are much different from that of adult patients. When children are
admitted to the hospital some feel a sense of alienation, loss of appetite,
insomnia, depression, anxiety, fear and the list goes on. A very common
occurrence for many is trying to overcome the absolute boredom that often
ensues. If you or
anyone you know has ever endured a hospitalization recovering from illness or
injury then you probably already know the kind of boring we’re talking about.
Through the eyes of a child it is even worse as days and nights seem to have
days and nights of their own. In addition to shear boredom, those who face
hospitalization may also deal with depression, anxiety, and countless other
side effects. If only there was a way to provide a therapeutic distraction.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Why CBD Will Change People's Life.</p> <ul> <li>
<p><strong>1) CBD is an antibacterial and slows bacterial growth.</strong> This is significant for those of us who are dealing with an imbalance of bad bacteria which can cause health problems such as gum disease, heart disease, and intestinal issues.</p>
<p><strong>2) When you take CBD, it does not cause the typical “high” associated with cannabis.</strong>In fact, CBD works as a partner with THC to balance its psychoactive effects. My personal experience with high CBD cannabis medicines is that they leave me clear-headed, positive, energetic, and relaxed. <em>I describe this state as feeling like myself.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) CBD reduces inflammation.</strong> Let me repeat that, CBD reduces inflammation!! Inflammation in the body causes disease. Less inflammation, less disease.</p>
<p><strong>4) CBD promotes bone growth.</strong> How many people do you know that have a musculoskeletal deficiency who would benefit from a non-toxic, natural medicine for bone growth? When I first learned that taking cannabis could keep my bones strong I think I may have teared up. There are not too many things I wouldn’t do to be able to age without a degenerating, scoliotic spine so to know that this is one of the potential benefits of the CBD medicine that I am taking leaves me feeling incredibly grateful.</p>
<p><strong>5) CBD reduces function in the immune system.</strong> If you suffer with an autoimmune disorder calming your overactive immune system down is vital for your continuing health. When my immune system is overactive I have all sorts of funky things happen to me: migraines, body pain, numb fingers and toes, and so on. Having a medicine that can help me regulate immune function is more valuable to me than the words can find.</p>
<p><strong>6) CBD relieves anxiety.</strong> How lovely is that? I’m a relatively even tempered person, I think, but I do deal with anxiety. I am aware that this is a side effect of having chronic pain but that doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. CBD’s allow me to relax and feel like somebody who can handle the regular stresses of life during spells of anxiety.</p>

</div></div>","Is CBD Legal? It is legal in all 50 states and has none of the legal or regulatory hurdles associated with Cannabis. We verify that all CBD we purchase is at or below our standard of .01% THC by volume (Federal Law requires THC levels to be maintained below .03% by volume) using certified labs.  


  Why We Need Funding: Explained  Some Of The Funds Will Go To Buying Bottles & Ingredients To Fill Orders. We Have The Recipe Down It's All Natural.. Sweet We Just Need Funds.
Funds For Fulfilling Orders & Money To Advertise To Get It Out There!  We Have Had People Try This And It's Gonna Take Off
Your Funds Will Help Us Get In Dispensary's & Shops For CBD All Around The World!
If We Don't Meet Our Goal The Funds We Make Will Go To Make What We Can Use It For And Send Orders Out. To Those That Donated 
It's Made By Us License Caregiver's.
 So We Don't Need Manufacturing Funds.    Product Information:

We Use Solventless Concetrate(No Butane Etc)
All Ingredients Are All Natural
No Illegal Narcotic's Such As Codeine
All Of Our Stuff Is Medical Lab Tested



The Impact Why CBD Will Change People's Life.  
1) CBD is an antibacterial and slows bacterial growth. This is significant for those of us who are dealing with an imbalance of bad bacteria which can cause health problems such as gum disease, heart disease, and intestinal issues.
2) When you take CBD, it does not cause the typical “high” associated with cannabis.In fact, CBD works as a partner with THC to balance its psychoactive effects. My personal experience with high CBD cannabis medicines is that they leave me clear-headed, positive, energetic, and relaxed. I describe this state as feeling like myself.
3) CBD reduces inflammation. Let me repeat that, CBD reduces inflammation!! Inflammation in the body causes disease. Less inflammation, less disease.
4) CBD promotes bone growth. How many people do you know that have a musculoskeletal deficiency who would benefit from a non-toxic, natural medicine for bone growth? When I first learned that taking cannabis could keep my bones strong I think I may have teared up. There are not too many things I wouldn’t do to be able to age without a degenerating, scoliotic spine so to know that this is one of the potential benefits of the CBD medicine that I am taking leaves me feeling incredibly grateful.
5) CBD reduces function in the immune system. If you suffer with an autoimmune disorder calming your overactive immune system down is vital for your continuing health. When my immune system is overactive I have all sorts of funky things happen to me: migraines, body pain, numb fingers and toes, and so on. Having a medicine that can help me regulate immune function is more valuable to me than the words can find.
6) CBD relieves anxiety. How lovely is that? I’m a relatively even tempered person, I think, but I do deal with anxiety. I am aware that this is a side effect of having chronic pain but that doesn’t make it any easier to deal with. CBD’s allow me to relax and feel like somebody who can handle the regular stresses of life during spells of anxiety.
7) CBD relieves pain. This is by far the most dramatic thing that CBD does for me personally. To be able to have relief from the pain that is debilitating you and locking you within your body feels like absolute freedom.
8) CBD suppresses muscles spasms. I actually had to think about the last time I had muscle spasms because it has been a while. I used to get them all the time before I started using medicinal cannabis but now they are something that I used to get.
9) CBD reduces blood sugar levels. High blood sugar can cause havoc in the body. Ask any person with diabetes and they will tell you that regulating your blood sugar is vital to one’s health and vitality.
10) CBD reduces seizures. I don’t have personal experience with this one but I do know of people who have been able to reduce and in some cases stop the seizures that they experience by using high CBD cannabis.
Bonus:
11) CBD inhibits cancer cell growth. Oh, did I mention it fights cancer?
I am just scratching the surface here of what CBDs  can do for the body but that is a pretty impressive list, isn’t it?
How does one effectively get CBDs in their body? You’ll have to first seek out cannabis strains and medicines that contain high CBD. This will require a little homework and probably a little shopping around to find the one that is right for you. The most superior ways that I have found to get CBD through cannabis is by regularly taking it orally or applying it topically to the skin.
I would just like to add that my life drastically changed for the better when I found cannabis medicines with high CBDs. Thankfully I live in a part of the world that allows me to have safe access to this medicine.
May you have safe access to CBD too.

<h4 style=""text-align: left;""><span>OUR STORY:</span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>Four years ago, on a hot July day, my partner Craig and I were lazily sipping martinis at an outdoor bistro in York Beach, Maine. Suddenly, in a surreal flash, a young woman rode by on a pink polka dot bicycle wearing a matching pink polka dot outfit, while talking on her neon green cellphone. It was the only thing surrounding her person that wasn’t pink. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span><span>We were star struck. We just knew there was something magical about this fashionista we nicknamed Mzzz Pink.  For days we couldn't stop wondering about her, until we suddenly realized who she was. Mzzz Pink was the Madonna of an entire magical cartoon city we were about to create.  When that young woman pedaled by dripping in pink, we caught a glimpse of our future.</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span><span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/958982/files/20141025135511-Mzzz_Pink_and_Uno.png?1414270511"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>When asked to describe our cartoon world Splash City's beginnings, I often tell this story, and then watch the reactions of the listeners. Shoulders relax. Heads nod in rhythm to the stories peaks and valleys. Imagining Mzzz Pink, listener's eyes sparkled as if they were present at the event. Just what experience were we really sharing?</p>
<p>Perhaps it was years ago, perhaps it was yesterday, but at some point in their life, they had a similar experience. As I shared my story, they were most likely internally re-experiencing theirs; the day they brought home their new puppy, met a beloved celebrity at a coffee shop, or saw a double rainbow glistening over their house. The type of experience didn't matter. Something unexpected and extraordinary entered their life for a fleeting moment and then became a cherished memory that lasted for years. Why? What was so special about those moments?</p>
<p>When Mzzz Pink first showed up in our lives, we couldn't have answered that question.  Yet the travels that would come after following her lead helped us not only to understand, but to create a revolutionary method to both illuminate and sustain such a state. Over time, we came to understand that it's not the experience itself, but the all too rare state of being that the unique experience prompted; a state of wonder.</p>
<h3>BATHOLOGY: Awaken to Wonder</h3>
<h4>Fusing Soap &amp; Story to Cleanse Body &amp; Mind</h4>
<p>I am a Screenwriter and a Psychotherapist. My partner Craig is a Producer who is passionate about the art and science of the dream. We met when we were both at a point in our lives where we were ready for our next adventure. The moment we ""met"" Mzzz Pink sparked an incredible journey that has brought us here, to showcase the unique and comprehensive method we created to help make wonder last, through the unlikely fusion of cartoon, story and a simple bar of soap. </p>
<p>Here's a brief introduction:</p>

<p><strong>THE STORY:</strong></p>
<blockquote>""Telling stories is not just the oldest form of entertainment, it's the highest form of consciousness... Increasingly, success in the information age demands that we harness the power of stories... Stories are... state of the heart technology."" - Producer Peter Guber, Psychology Today, 2011</blockquote>
<p>What's the story you're telling about yourself? Is it humdrum... or vibrant?</p>
<p>It's the stories we tell ourselves daily without realizing it that often keep us stuck in a less than optimal state, yet it's also a new story that can free us.</p>
<p>Recent neuroscience studies suggest that when reading a story, different brain regions collaborate to create an experience that is much like imagining a real life, vivid event. In Splash City, we offer you an entire comical world for you to project into, lose yourself and experience-take; a new story to tell yourself.<br/></p>
<p>All Splash City stories are written in the Hero's Journey format, especially designed to help ""awaken the hero within,""while<span style=""background-color: initial;""> the fable format encourages you to repeat your experience; to read the stories over and over again, gaining new insight each time. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Splash City cartoon characters serve as a simple visual cue to instantly bring back your experience, every time you gaze at them. </span></p>

<blockquote>Today, movies, TV &amp; video games are playing in 3D. But what about us? Are we playing in 3D? Or are we living in a flat, 2D state of mind?</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In today's fast-paced information age, many live
their lives in a state of overwhelm and paralysis. This is the result of what
we at Splash City Studios call the ""How-to"" world.</p>
<p>Like eating empty
carbs, we stuff ourselves with information in the hopes of improving our lives
and end up malnourished and wanting more, never achieving the results we were
looking for, and often becoming disillusioned, cynical and operating in a flat, 2D state of mind.</p>Rather than piling on more information that can make you feel even more overwhelmed, Splash City Life Fables and Cartoon Mentors offer a common sense approach that is more nourishing to our souls, with heartfelt stories that are therapeutically woven to help us begin ""playing in 3D"". <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>THE HIDDEN GEM:</h4>
<p>Each book in the Splash City Bathology series tells a story of one exceptional Splash City character who reveals, in their own voice, the hidden gem they discovered on their journey. The gem found in each book is a coherent concept that is personified by a particular character so they may serve as a role model to help you discover and claim the gem within yourself. </p>

<br/><p>We identified and developed 11 concepts significant for ""playing in 3D"" and then simplified them into key phrases (the titles of each book) that are attributes of a particular character. Each Splash City Cartoon Mentor represents a particular concept that they have truly mastered, and teaches that concept through their unique and magical story. </p>
<p>We then paired a particular scented soap with the Cartoon Mentor, and the 3D attribute associated with their story.  <br/></p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">""I feel so moved after reading your latest book! It was authentic, lovingly written and powerful in its implications... The discussion on why story is so effective as a means of changing your brain and state of mind is really powerful... I was struck by cynicism being mistaken for critical thinking. That is a powerful observation and it's so relevant... unfortunately, many view cynicism as the new hip way to look at life. "" - Dani S.,  Respite Director, Yoga Instructor</span> </blockquote>
<blockquote>""Feeling drained and overwhelmed, I stepped into a hot bathtub with a bar of Bathology soap and a Splash City Studios book.... aaahhh... easy to read yet so much depth.... a lasting experience that just might change your life.""  - Laurie D., Business Owner</blockquote>
<blockquote> ""I was surprised to find that Miss Guided Light was a nurse. I am a nurse of 23 years... Miss Guided Light was as unhappy at her job as I was at mine.... I'm happy to say that, with a little help from Miss Guided Light... I was finally able to take my own leap of faith and have the courage to step away from what I knew was wrong for me and start looking for my real path."" - Jeannine M. RN, BSN, LNC</blockquote>

<p>You probably see it every day. All over the media are""qualified"" experts that have a formula to dictate the means to get whatever it is we want. These experts come in the form of pundits, talk show hosts, judges on reality TV shows, and even educators. We are bombarded with them to the extent that it has become a form of ""How-to"" programming that shapes our beliefs, decisions, and the direction of our lives, and has helped produce an epidemic of cynicism. </p>
<p>Cynicism has become so acceptable it is all too often misconstrued as critical thinking, but it is actually a form of righteous naivete that allows little or no room for serendipity, imagination, or wonder. </p>

<p>Creating the cartoon world Splash City (on our website) was the first phase of our journey. The stories were written during the second phase, while creating Bathology, self-publishing the books and designing the products, was the third,  It has been a phenomenal journey into the unknown, with Calm &amp; Sense as our constant guides. (Calm &amp; Sense are even the names of characters in the first two books.)</p>
<p>We have done all of this over the last four years on limited resources, and now it's time to take it to the next level - to you. </p>
<p>Not only do we want to build a community and an audience, we have reached the point where our business is ready to launch. </p>
<p><b>THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR JOURNEY:</b><br/></p>
<p>Just like with a diet or exercise routine, for Bathology to be effective, it must be practiced daily and over a period of time. It's extremely important to use the same cues (the soap, its aroma, and images of the Cartoon Mentors). </p>
<p>A Calm &amp; Sense subscription service makes it as easy as possible for you to make Bathology a regular part of your life. </p>
<h4 style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Advantages of Bathology and our Calm &amp; Sense Club:</h4>

<p>With the funds we raise here, beginning in the spring of 2015 (we will keep you constantly updated!), we will launch the Calm &amp; Sense subscription service. </p>
<p>In the Calm &amp; Sense Club, you simply sign up, and every three months we will send you refills and a fresh splash of wonder from our cartoon world.<br/></p>

<p>For a small monthly fee, every three months a package will arrive at your door filled with soaps, books, and as always, a splash of wonder.  </p>
<p>The funds we raise in this campaign will pay for the set up of the Subscription service, inventory, and marketing. After the subscription service is up and running, we plan to add more soaps to our product line, one for each of our 11 Cartoon Mentors. We would also like to do a Bathology demonstration video, to be up and running on our website in time for the launch of the Calm &amp; Sense Club.</p>

If you are interested, please watch for our updates, and feel free to contact us with any questions at splashcitysoaps@gmail.com.</p>
<p>To those of you who want to gather together to begin ""playing in 3D"", we also offer a Story Circle Guide which directs you inside the Splash City fables and helps you rewrite your own story, alongside your friends.

OUR STORY:
Four years ago, on a hot July day, my partner Craig and I were lazily sipping martinis at an outdoor bistro in York Beach, Maine. Suddenly, in a surreal flash, a young woman rode by on a pink polka dot bicycle wearing a matching pink polka dot outfit, while talking on her neon green cellphone. It was the only thing surrounding her person that wasn’t pink. 
We were star struck. We just knew there was something magical about this fashionista we nicknamed Mzzz Pink.  For days we couldn't stop wondering about her, until we suddenly realized who she was. Mzzz Pink was the Madonna of an entire magical cartoon city we were about to create.  When that young woman pedaled by dripping in pink, we caught a glimpse of our future.



When asked to describe our cartoon world Splash City's beginnings, I often tell this story, and then watch the reactions of the listeners. Shoulders relax. Heads nod in rhythm to the stories peaks and valleys. Imagining Mzzz Pink, listener's eyes sparkled as if they were present at the event. Just what experience were we really sharing?
Perhaps it was years ago, perhaps it was yesterday, but at some point in their life, they had a similar experience. As I shared my story, they were most likely internally re-experiencing theirs; the day they brought home their new puppy, met a beloved celebrity at a coffee shop, or saw a double rainbow glistening over their house. The type of experience didn't matter. Something unexpected and extraordinary entered their life for a fleeting moment and then became a cherished memory that lasted for years. Why? What was so special about those moments?
When Mzzz Pink first showed up in our lives, we couldn't have answered that question.  Yet the travels that would come after following her lead helped us not only to understand, but to create a revolutionary method to both illuminate and sustain such a state. Over time, we came to understand that it's not the experience itself, but the all too rare state of being that the unique experience prompted; a state of wonder.
BATHOLOGY: Awaken to Wonder
Fusing Soap & Story to Cleanse Body & Mind
I am a Screenwriter and a Psychotherapist. My partner Craig is a Producer who is passionate about the art and science of the dream. We met when we were both at a point in our lives where we were ready for our next adventure. The moment we ""met"" Mzzz Pink sparked an incredible journey that has brought us here, to showcase the unique and comprehensive method we created to help make wonder last, through the unlikely fusion of cartoon, story and a simple bar of soap. 
Here's a brief introduction:


Bathology is a simple, effective and fun daily practice that fuses SOAP & STORY to cleanse the body & mind, instantly revitalizing our STATE; turning frowns into smiles and worry into wonder. 


THE SOAP:



Remember lather, rinse, repeat?
Scientists have recently shown we can revitalize our brains as we do our skin and hair.  It's kind of like lather, rinse, repeat, with an emphasis on repeat. 
Every day we take a shower to clean off yesterday's toxins on our body, but what about yesterday's emotional toxins?  Typically we step into the shower worrying about yesterday, and allow those toxins to churn into emotional muck.
Rather than regurgitating yesterday's troubles, our time in the shower could be better spent refreshing our state of mind. 



Using a colorful bar of aromatherapy scented Artisan soap (the one pictured above is Imagine That! (Cranberry Fig)), a quick empowering practice, and a cartoon image that cues a special Splash City story,  we can revitalize our state of mind, and awaken to wonder.



THE STORY:
""Telling stories is not just the oldest form of entertainment, it's the highest form of consciousness... Increasingly, success in the information age demands that we harness the power of stories... Stories are... state of the heart technology."" - Producer Peter Guber, Psychology Today, 2011
What's the story you're telling about yourself? Is it humdrum... or vibrant?
It's the stories we tell ourselves daily without realizing it that often keep us stuck in a less than optimal state, yet it's also a new story that can free us.
Recent neuroscience studies suggest that when reading a story, different brain regions collaborate to create an experience that is much like imagining a real life, vivid event. In Splash City, we offer you an entire comical world for you to project into, lose yourself and experience-take; a new story to tell yourself.
All Splash City stories are written in the Hero's Journey format, especially designed to help ""awaken the hero within,""while the fable format encourages you to repeat your experience; to read the stories over and over again, gaining new insight each time. 
The Splash City cartoon characters serve as a simple visual cue to instantly bring back your experience, every time you gaze at them. 



THE STATE:
Today, movies, TV & video games are playing in 3D. But what about us? Are we playing in 3D? Or are we living in a flat, 2D state of mind?

In today's fast-paced information age, many live
their lives in a state of overwhelm and paralysis. This is the result of what
we at Splash City Studios call the ""How-to"" world.
Like eating empty
carbs, we stuff ourselves with information in the hopes of improving our lives
and end up malnourished and wanting more, never achieving the results we were
looking for, and often becoming disillusioned, cynical and operating in a flat, 2D state of mind.Rather than piling on more information that can make you feel even more overwhelmed, Splash City Life Fables and Cartoon Mentors offer a common sense approach that is more nourishing to our souls, with heartfelt stories that are therapeutically woven to help us begin ""playing in 3D"".  




THE HIDDEN GEM:
Each book in the Splash City Bathology series tells a story of one exceptional Splash City character who reveals, in their own voice, the hidden gem they discovered on their journey. The gem found in each book is a coherent concept that is personified by a particular character so they may serve as a role model to help you discover and claim the gem within yourself. 


We identified and developed 11 concepts significant for ""playing in 3D"" and then simplified them into key phrases (the titles of each book) that are attributes of a particular character. Each Splash City Cartoon Mentor represents a particular concept that they have truly mastered, and teaches that concept through their unique and magical story. 
We then paired a particular scented soap with the Cartoon Mentor, and the 3D attribute associated with their story.  

We've written the first four books of what will eventually be 11 books, one for each Cartoon Mentor and their 3D attribute. (Illustrations of Ms. Bee Haven, Mzzz Pink and Uno are by Shay Burleigh.)The first three books are the foundation of ""playing in 3D"", or what we call the ""Lost Arts"" : Imagination, Self-reliance and Will. 

TESTIMONIALS: Whatever you focus on expands.

The daily practice of Bathology encourages BALANCE, FOCUS, CALM & SENSE, and of course WONDER.  
Here's a sample of what we are hearing from those who are currently practicing Bathology:

""I feel so moved after reading your latest book! It was authentic, lovingly written and powerful in its implications... The discussion on why story is so effective as a means of changing your brain and state of mind is really powerful... I was struck by cynicism being mistaken for critical thinking. That is a powerful observation and it's so relevant... unfortunately, many view cynicism as the new hip way to look at life. "" - Dani S.,  Respite Director, Yoga Instructor 
""Feeling drained and overwhelmed, I stepped into a hot bathtub with a bar of Bathology soap and a Splash City Studios book.... aaahhh... easy to read yet so much depth.... a lasting experience that just might change your life.""  - Laurie D., Business Owner
 ""I was surprised to find that Miss Guided Light was a nurse. I am a nurse of 23 years... Miss Guided Light was as unhappy at her job as I was at mine.... I'm happy to say that, with a little help from Miss Guided Light... I was finally able to take my own leap of faith and have the courage to step away from what I knew was wrong for me and start looking for my real path."" - Jeannine M. RN, BSN, LNC
""This is the best gift I've received in a long time... a powerful and much needed avenue for self-discovery.""  Sande B., Certified Hypnotherapist 
We can't wait to hear about YOUR experience with Bathology!

Raising the BAR: An anti-Cynicism Campaign


Have you been singing to this choir?


At Splash City Soaps, we're raising the BAR toward WONDER, and we're also raising the BAR to override cynicism. 
You probably see it every day. All over the media are""qualified"" experts that have a formula to dictate the means to get whatever it is we want. These experts come in the form of pundits, talk show hosts, judges on reality TV shows, and even educators. We are bombarded with them to the extent that it has become a form of ""How-to"" programming that shapes our beliefs, decisions, and the direction of our lives, and has helped produce an epidemic of cynicism. 
Cynicism has become so acceptable it is all too often misconstrued as critical thinking, but it is actually a form of righteous naivete that allows little or no room for serendipity, imagination, or wonder. 
Cynicism is not critical thinking. Cynicism is the opposite of wonder. It's really bullying in disguise.
At Splash City Soaps, we created a special bar of Citrus, Cedar & Sage soap dedicated to overriding cynicism. We call it:
Circles of Life: An Anti-cynic Soap.






   
Help us create the Calm & Sense Club: 

We need your help to help you begin ""playing in 3D!"" 


Creating the cartoon world Splash City (on our website) was the first phase of our journey. The stories were written during the second phase, while creating Bathology, self-publishing the books and designing the products, was the third,  It has been a phenomenal journey into the unknown, with Calm & Sense as our constant guides. (Calm & Sense are even the names of characters in the first two books.)
We have done all of this over the last four years on limited resources, and now it's time to take it to the next level - to you. 
Not only do we want to build a community and an audience, we have reached the point where our business is ready to launch. 
THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR JOURNEY:
Just like with a diet or exercise routine, for Bathology to be effective, it must be practiced daily and over a period of time. It's extremely important to use the same cues (the soap, its aroma, and images of the Cartoon Mentors). 
A Calm & Sense subscription service makes it as easy as possible for you to make Bathology a regular part of your life. 
Advantages of Bathology and our Calm & Sense Club:


An exclusive Spa Treatment like no other in your very own home!
Convenience. Bathology comes to your door, and takes no extra time out of your busy schedule. Practice Bathology during your daily shower.
Change worry into wonder.
Improve your focus.
Begin your day with a sense of balance.
Enhance a state of gratitude.
Raise your BAR to override CYNICISM


With the funds we raise here, beginning in the spring of 2015 (we will keep you constantly updated!), we will launch the Calm & Sense subscription service. 
In the Calm & Sense Club, you simply sign up, and every three months we will send you refills and a fresh splash of wonder from our cartoon world.


For a small monthly fee, every three months a package will arrive at your door filled with soaps, books, and as always, a splash of wonder.  
The funds we raise in this campaign will pay for the set up of the Subscription service, inventory, and marketing. After the subscription service is up and running, we plan to add more soaps to our product line, one for each of our 11 Cartoon Mentors. We would also like to do a Bathology demonstration video, to be up and running on our website in time for the launch of the Calm & Sense Club.
Unfortunately, we are unable to get you started on the subscription service now, but we will be notifying you with an update here as soon as its ready so you can sign up. If you are interested, please watch for our updates, and feel free to contact us with any questions at splashcitysoaps@gmail.com.
To those of you who want to gather together to begin ""playing in 3D"", we also offer a Story Circle Guide which directs you inside the Splash City fables and helps you rewrite your own story, alongside your friends. (Are you a Wellness Practitioner? We can also sell the books and product line to you wholesale, so you can bring Bathology to your students or clients.)
HELP US SURPASS OUR GOAL and FREE OUR 3D CARTOON MENTORS FROM THE 2D WORLD!
As it now stands, our Cartoon Mentors are used only as icons on our websites and the covers of our books.  They are 3D characters stuck in a 2D world!


Help us free them! We'd like to animate them so they can come alive and talk, and help you begin playing in 3D. 
If we surpass our goal, we can hire animators, artists, and voice over talent to start making the first short (less than one minute) animated videos. The first Splash City story we'd like to turn into a short video is The Anger Bank...
If we really, really surpass our goal, we can make an app! With a Splash City app, you can cue your Cartoon Mentors to bring you back to a 3D state whenever you need a recharge. And, you can also splash your friends on the go! 
Somewhere in the midst of all this excitement, we hope to finish the fifth book in the series: Rise Up to the Wave by Justin Tide: ""A new kid in town, surfer Justin Tide arrives in Splash City to discover its residents carry ladders, not surfboards. An outcast until he opens his own surf shop in an abandoned beach shack, Justin teaches his new Splash City friends the life-changing power of riding a wave.""

Once you receive your perks and begin practicing Bathology, we would love to hear from you! Some folks we've heard from are already having life-changing results.
Our campaign ends on Thanksgiving, which we feel is fitting, for Bathology is all about encouraging gratitude.Bathology makes a great gift.  Since it is so late in the year, we are not able to offer shipments in time for Christmas. However, ebooks will be emailed JUST before Christmas (and all our books are available through Amazon via our website.)
And...what better way to begin the new year but with Bathology?! 
Make 2015 a NO HUMDRUM YEAR!
SPLASH YOUR FRIENDS!
Everyone knows someone who feels stuck in a cage like Uno,  who has lost her way like Miss Guided Light, who has a dream like Velocity but doesn't know how to make it come true, or someone who needs Ms. Bee Haven's help to ""see the music"" and add a splash of enchantment to their life.

<p>Working with animals is my passion, and as my business goes through a period of amazing growth, I've definitely been able to do that work a lot!  I often find myself working 7-days/week, without enough spare time for the tasks I desperately want to complete to take my company to the next level.  This includes:</p>

Help
us provide the InfoSec community with the best, FREE conference in
Las Vegas, and join us in celebrating our fifth anniversary!!</p>
<h1>
<b>Who
we are/why we do this:</b>
</h1>
<p>
BSidesLV is a
labor of love, for and by members of the Information Security community. During the conference, we have over 100 volunteers present including ~ 20 core volunteer staff, some of whom put in months of work before hand, to make this event come together. What started in 2009 as two days of like-minded
friends getting together for a handful of talks in a rented house,
with a trunkload of burgers, buns and a grill, has grown in scope and
size to a 5 track, 1000+ participant, 100 speaker event in a small
Las Vegas hotel conference center. That first event has launched a worldwide movement of community organized Security BSides
conferences. BSidesLV 2014 will mark the fifth anniversary of the
Security BSides phenomena and will be the 134th global event. For
more information on Security BSides, our mission, and our reach,
please visit our main website at <a href=""securitybsides.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/712301/securitybsides.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">securitybsides.org</a>. All proceeds from this project will be combined with corporate
sponsorship dollars to ensure that we can host the best conference
possible and still keep it free for students, the unemployed looking
for work in InfoSec, and those who feel that many conferences are overpriced. </p>
<h1>
<b>What
BSidesLV is:</b>
</h1>
<p>
We
offer two days of Information Security talks over 5
tracks, including a Speaker Development Mentorship program for
first-time national speakers. We host a Joes vs. Pros Capture the
Flag competition, the World Championship Social Engineering Capture
the Flag contest, a Locksport Village, a huge chill-out space, multiple
workshops, and access to representatives
from <a href=""http://hackersforcharity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hackersforcharity.org</a>, <a href=""http://eff.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EFF.org</a>, and other organizations, including our annual ""Ask the EFF"" panel in our Off-the-Record track. We host a silent auction to benefit the charitable
organizations we support, and a 50/50 raffle to give away some great
prizes from our sponsors. There are no ""attendees"" at a BSides event,
only participants. Every person who walks through our doors is there
to engage the hottest minds in InfoSec - and be engaged by them. This is a two way street.</p>
<p>
This
year, we're combining forces and space with <a href=""http://passwordscon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PasswordsCon.org</a>,
giving all of our participants a 2-for-1 conference experience. All
for the low, low admission price of <u>free</u>!</p><h1>Where will my money be going?</h1><p>Here is a general breakdown of costs from our 2013 event. This will give you a rough estimate of what it will cost us to produce this year's event, as well.</p><p></p><p>$86K on Venue - F&amp;B, A/V, rooms for supported charities and staff, pool buyout<br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$8.2K on Credentials (badges/wristbands)<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$6.8K on T-shirts<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$5.6K on Shuttles to the other InfoSec conferences in town<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$5K down payment on Venue for 2014<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$5K Legal Fees/Attorney<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$3.5K Miscellaneous<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$2K Accountant<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$1.5K on Printing (track signage, Wall of Support)<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$717 on Event insurance<br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">$650 on Radio rental</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">It cost us around $125K to throw last year's event. $102K of that came from our corporate sponsors.

With your help, we can make that goal!</span><br/></p>
<h1>
<b>What is with the </b><b>meal tickets?</b>
</h1>
<p>
The loudest
feedback we received last year was that we couldn't provide meals for
everyone. We wish we could enjoy community meals the way we did at
the first BSidesLV events, but that is no longer feasible. We still
can't afford to feed everyone, but we can invite you to dine with us.
So please, pick-up a meal ticket or four and join the staff, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers for a hot buffet-style breakfast
and lunch, and continue the conversation, without having to leave the
conference area. Or get a couple of four-packs and feed a friend or
co-worker. You could even pay it forward and let us distribute them
for you, to a student or another participant in want of a meal. The bottom line is, we would love for you to break bread with us.</p><h2>Why IndieGoGo?</h2><p></p><h1></h1><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This campaign is designed to augment our corporate sponsorship drive and give our community members a way to give back. Too many of those in InfoSec work 60-80hr weeks and just don't have the time or energy to volunteer their hours, but have asked how they might help us in other ways. We developed the levels here as a way to ensure that our donors receive recognition and even more return on their investment. Last year, we created a private WePay page and collected donations through Twitter and our website, but WePay recently changed their model forcing us to find a better outlet for collection.

us provide the InfoSec community with the best, FREE conference in
Las Vegas, and join us in celebrating our fifth anniversary!!

Who
we are/why we do this:


BSidesLV is a
labor of love, for and by members of the Information Security community. During the conference, we have over 100 volunteers present including ~ 20 core volunteer staff, some of whom put in months of work before hand, to make this event come together. What started in 2009 as two days of like-minded
friends getting together for a handful of talks in a rented house,
with a trunkload of burgers, buns and a grill, has grown in scope and
size to a 5 track, 1000+ participant, 100 speaker event in a small
Las Vegas hotel conference center. That first event has launched a worldwide movement of community organized Security BSides
conferences. BSidesLV 2014 will mark the fifth anniversary of the
Security BSides phenomena and will be the 134th global event. For
more information on Security BSides, our mission, and our reach,
please visit our main website at securitybsides.org. All proceeds from this project will be combined with corporate
sponsorship dollars to ensure that we can host the best conference
possible and still keep it free for students, the unemployed looking
for work in InfoSec, and those who feel that many conferences are overpriced. 

What
BSidesLV is:


We
offer two days of Information Security talks over 5
tracks, including a Speaker Development Mentorship program for
first-time national speakers. We host a Joes vs. Pros Capture the
Flag competition, the World Championship Social Engineering Capture
the Flag contest, a Locksport Village, a huge chill-out space, multiple
workshops, and access to representatives
from hackersforcharity.org, EFF.org, and other organizations, including our annual ""Ask the EFF"" panel in our Off-the-Record track. We host a silent auction to benefit the charitable
organizations we support, and a 50/50 raffle to give away some great
prizes from our sponsors. There are no ""attendees"" at a BSides event,
only participants. Every person who walks through our doors is there
to engage the hottest minds in InfoSec - and be engaged by them. This is a two way street.

This
year, we're combining forces and space with PasswordsCon.org,
giving all of our participants a 2-for-1 conference experience. All
for the low, low admission price of free!Where will my money be going?Here is a general breakdown of costs from our 2013 event. This will give you a rough estimate of what it will cost us to produce this year's event, as well.$86K on Venue - F&B, A/V, rooms for supported charities and staff, pool buyout$8.2K on Credentials (badges/wristbands)$6.8K on T-shirts$5.6K on Shuttles to the other InfoSec conferences in town$5K down payment on Venue for 2014$5K Legal Fees/Attorney$3.5K Miscellaneous$2K Accountant$1.5K on Printing (track signage, Wall of Support)$717 on Event insurance$650 on Radio rentalIt cost us around $125K to throw last year's event. $102K of that came from our corporate sponsors. The remainder came from generous donors like you.This year, we are hoping to increase our budget by another $25K, to ensure a GREAT fifth anniversary conference. With your help, we can make that goal!

What is with the meal tickets?


The loudest
feedback we received last year was that we couldn't provide meals for
everyone. We wish we could enjoy community meals the way we did at
the first BSidesLV events, but that is no longer feasible. We still
can't afford to feed everyone, but we can invite you to dine with us.
So please, pick-up a meal ticket or four and join the staff, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers for a hot buffet-style breakfast
and lunch, and continue the conversation, without having to leave the
conference area. Or get a couple of four-packs and feed a friend or
co-worker. You could even pay it forward and let us distribute them
for you, to a student or another participant in want of a meal. The bottom line is, we would love for you to break bread with us.Why IndieGoGo?This campaign is designed to augment our corporate sponsorship drive and give our community members a way to give back. Too many of those in InfoSec work 60-80hr weeks and just don't have the time or energy to volunteer their hours, but have asked how they might help us in other ways. We developed the levels here as a way to ensure that our donors receive recognition and even more return on their investment. Last year, we created a private WePay page and collected donations through Twitter and our website, but WePay recently changed their model forcing us to find a better outlet for collection. We chose IndieGoGo because they offer flex-funding, as well as the ability to control our reward levels. If this campaign isn't fully funded, the producer is well aware of where to make adjustments to the budget. Of course we hope this won't happen, because our industry is so supportive, but if it does, BSidesLV will go on.Please help us further our mission of providing free education to this generation of
Information Security specialists, by donating a few dollars. If
you'll be in Vegas for ""Security Summer Camp"" in August,

</h3><p>Today, we are
going to introduce you to a revolutionary approach in heat and power
generation. It will enable homes  and small businesses to
significantly lower energy costs and emissions, while also allowing
them to generate a profit. 
</p>
<p>GasDecEngine Technology designs and
develops ultra-high efficiency micro-combined heat and power (micro
CHP) steam engines for the international market based on two patents
that we own.   Our products are ideal substitutes for the five
million boilers replaced in Europe each year. <br/></p><p>We
 are seeking to raise US$150,000 to build a market prototype of our 
engine.  It will be augmented by a grant worth US$ 180.000 from Innovation 
Norway.  </p>
<p>With the world reached peak fuel consumption, the pressure on governments to lower CO2 emissions to address climate
change increases. European governments are providing incentives to homeowners
and businesses to use fuel more efficiently.  
</p>
<p>Most of our energy today is created using inefficient fuel sources and is later distributed by electrical grids (contributing to more energy loss). For example, a typical coal-fired power plant converts about 30% of the coal into electricity, giving it a 30% efficiency rating. The remainder of the energy is released into the atmosphere as heat exhaust. Even more of the energy is lost when it is transferred and distributed over the grid system to the end user.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576110/files/20140513032554-effekt_en.jpg?1399976754"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Distributed energy (or co-location, in
which energy is generated at a business, a home or within a
community)  is a growing trend being promoted by many governments to
lower emissions and reduce wasted energy and therefore lowering energy costs.  
Solar, wind and geothermal energy are great examples. However, current implementations of these technologies are not sufficient to provide all our
electrical and heating needs.  As we shift towards a carbon-neutral
economy, we need technologies that make a more efficient use of fossil and most off all
renewable fuels -- similar to hybrid vehicles. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576114/files/20140513032826-house.jpg?1399976906"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Combined heat and power, known as CHP,
is a more efficient solution which uses  conventional and renewable fuels, while reducing emissions and improving efficiency.  CHP
engines create electricity and capture the exhaust to use as heat,
making them much more efficient.  And because they are located on
site, there is no loss from transmission.  
</p>
<p>Although older CHP engines were used by
large industrial buildings, modern CHP engines are more efficient and
small enough to be used in a home or small business, such as a
hospital, hotel, school or nursing home.  These are referred to as micro-CHP
engines.  
</p>
<p>Boilers tend to only provide heat. 
Micro-CHP engines are more efficient because they use fuel to create
electricity, and then capture the exhaust to be used as heat.  Excess
electricity generated by the micro-CHP engine can also generate
revenues in certain markets like Germany and the United Kingdom by
being sold back to the electricity provider or used at home.    
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/620028/files/20140602055926-energyuse.png?1401713966"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>However, even micro-CHP engines have
their limitations.   Micro-CHP engines being produced today have
relatively low efficiency in terms of electricity generation. 
Typically, CHP engines are able to convert 15 to 35%  percent of
their energy into electricity, with most of the remainder being used
for internal consumbtion to run the engine.  Our engine has a mechanical efficiency for the
generation of electricity of 62%, and a combined efficiency of 95%.
Our engine’s higher mechanical efficiency translates into lower
operating costs and a higher return on investment
for our customers, which we believe creates a competitive advantage
for GasDecEngine.    
</p>
<p>Our patented technology makes our
engine the Toyota Prius of energy generation: unlike conventional
boilers, our micro-CHP allows you to lower your emissions today by
using any conventional fuel source (e.g. natural gas) or even
agricultural waste.  In the future, our technology will allow us to
build our engines to accept zero-carbon energy sources such as solar,
wind and geothermal energy. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576119/files/20140513033040-SpaceClaim.21.jpg?1399977040"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>We are seeking $150,000 to build a demo
CHP based on our engine.  For those kind enough to provide us with
money to build our costumer demo CHP, we will provide a number of
gifts which will enable you to have your own environmentally-friendly
heat and power generator to lower your energy costs and protect the
environment.  Depending on the level of support you provide, we will
give you either a blueprint or parts and instructions so that
you can build your own engine.  Or we can provide you with a
fully-assembled engine.

<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Working principles</h3><p>
</p><p>
Our engine is a steam type engine. Steam engines shaped countries
and industries. Steam engines connected continents before any
electrical current flow through a line. Even today, the modern
industry can not live without steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Behind the scenes, steam is still moving us. Almost every product we
take in our hands are connected to steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
GasDecEngine has develop a mechanism that brings the steam process in
a modern way in our homes. It is so simple, by converting the
movement of a linear piston to rotating shaft output.</p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FI8FOm9u8QM4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DI8FOm9u8QM4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FI8FOm9u8QM4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>Prototyp - proof of concept<br/></p>
<p>
By replacing the crankshaft we where able to get a much more powerful
and efficient mechanism.</p>
<p>
This engine have not the properties to work as an combustion engine,
but as a steam engine it works much better as all other engines in
conjunction with combined heat power production. In application like
that low revolution and high torque are must for a long lifespan.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p>So fare we have build several prototypes and tested them in closed thermodynamical cycles. Due to combined experience we have an overlook over the costs and effect of the planned demo CHP. <br/></p><p>Our experience with the prototypes shows us that we have to make a casting pattern for the engine block, so that we can manage the high torque. Further we have to implement a new type of burner for very low emissions. With our technology we are 40% under the emission from a conventional micro-CHP. <br/></p><p>We see us in a way as an environmental company and trying the best to live up to that. That´s why we do not send goods around the world without any practical use. We think that paying for your electricity is a fair way to stay in contact with us. For people in direct technology interest we offer some special technology transfer.</p><p>A lot of tech user around the world want to build their own power plant, but they need a real robust working horse in their drive train. That's why we offer for those supporters a technology transfer to collaborate aiming at further solutions with our engine. For that we can also provide the support from our production partners with their experience in machine building.<br/></p><h2>Time line</h2><ul>
<li>July 2014 ordering mold pattern for the engine , the mold will hold for  2000 engines</li>
<li>August 2014 - ordering control system for the engine and heating system<br/>
</li>
<li>September 2014 - machining of the engine parts</li>

<li>June 2015 - public presentation</li>
<li>July 2015 - first round of perks delivering<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p>In the first step our company will sell around 600 micro CHP per year. This means at least 600 homes and small businesses that get grid independent and generate their own energy by making also small profits by doing so. These micro CHP are prepared to work with natural gas, with the lowest emission on the marked. We are targeting the Western European country's as well the US and Canadian marked. In the second step we prepare the technology to use other liquid or gaseous renewable combustibles. <br/></p><p>By further marked penetration we like to  modify our heating system to be used in heat recovery and converting of solar energy to electricity and cooling. With that we will partnering interested companies for local independent grid solutions.</p><p>With all that, our technology will contribute in short terms to the efficient use of natural resources and make people grid independent.  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Together we make the difference</h3><p>We also like to get in touch with individuals and company's that are interested in local grid development and self building projects around the world. The more funds we raise, the more specific burners and possibilities can we provide. With that we can build service teams to provide the local needed development know-how.  Our outreach is to share the technology and the idea about home made energy self efficiency. Please share the project with your contacts.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/583284/files/20140516034349-SpaceClaim.1.jpg?1400237029"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Inside of the engine</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/583287/files/20140516034625-SpaceClaim.13.jpg?1400237185"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Demo plant engine with 400 Nm torque at 300 rpm.

renewable fuels -- similar to hybrid vehicles. 
Combined heat and power, known as CHP,
is a more efficient solution which uses  conventional and renewable fuels, while reducing emissions and improving efficiency.  CHP
engines create electricity and capture the exhaust to use as heat,
making them much more efficient.  And because they are located on
site, there is no loss from transmission.  

Although older CHP engines were used by
large industrial buildings, modern CHP engines are more efficient and
small enough to be used in a home or small business, such as a
hospital, hotel, school or nursing home.  These are referred to as micro-CHP
engines.  

Boilers tend to only provide heat. 
Micro-CHP engines are more efficient because they use fuel to create
electricity, and then capture the exhaust to be used as heat.  Excess
electricity generated by the micro-CHP engine can also generate
revenues in certain markets like Germany and the United Kingdom by
being sold back to the electricity provider or used at home.    

However, even micro-CHP engines have
their limitations.   Micro-CHP engines being produced today have
relatively low efficiency in terms of electricity generation. 
Typically, CHP engines are able to convert 15 to 35%  percent of
their energy into electricity, with most of the remainder being used
for internal consumbtion to run the engine.  Our engine has a mechanical efficiency for the
generation of electricity of 62%, and a combined efficiency of 95%.
Our engine’s higher mechanical efficiency translates into lower
operating costs and a higher return on investment
for our customers, which we believe creates a competitive advantage
for GasDecEngine.    

Our patented technology makes our
engine the Toyota Prius of energy generation: unlike conventional
boilers, our micro-CHP allows you to lower your emissions today by
using any conventional fuel source (e.g. natural gas) or even
agricultural waste.  In the future, our technology will allow us to
build our engines to accept zero-carbon energy sources such as solar,
wind and geothermal energy. 
We are seeking $150,000 to build a demo
CHP based on our engine.  For those kind enough to provide us with
money to build our costumer demo CHP, we will provide a number of
gifts which will enable you to have your own environmentally-friendly
heat and power generator to lower your energy costs and protect the
environment.  Depending on the level of support you provide, we will
give you either a blueprint or parts and instructions so that
you can build your own engine.  Or we can provide you with a
fully-assembled engine.

Working principles

Our engine is a steam type engine. Steam engines shaped countries
and industries. Steam engines connected continents before any
electrical current flow through a line. Even today, the modern
industry can not live without steam.


Behind the scenes, steam is still moving us. Almost every product we
take in our hands are connected to steam.


GasDecEngine has develop a mechanism that brings the steam process in
a modern way in our homes. It is so simple, by converting the
movement of a linear piston to rotating shaft output.Prototyp - proof of concept

By replacing the crankshaft we where able to get a much more powerful
and efficient mechanism.

This engine have not the properties to work as an combustion engine,
but as a steam engine it works much better as all other engines in
conjunction with combined heat power production. In application like
that low revolution and high torque are must for a long lifespan.

So fare we have build several prototypes and tested them in closed thermodynamical cycles. Due to combined experience we have an overlook over the costs and effect of the planned demo CHP. Our experience with the prototypes shows us that we have to make a casting pattern for the engine block, so that we can manage the high torque. Further we have to implement a new type of burner for very low emissions. With our technology we are 40% under the emission from a conventional micro-CHP. We see us in a way as an environmental company and trying the best to live up to that. That´s why we do not send goods around the world without any practical use. We think that paying for your electricity is a fair way to stay in contact with us. For people in direct technology interest we offer some special technology transfer.A lot of tech user around the world want to build their own power plant, but they need a real robust working horse in their drive train. That's why we offer for those supporters a technology transfer to collaborate aiming at further solutions with our engine. For that we can also provide the support from our production partners with their experience in machine building.Time line

The ImpactIn the first step our company will sell around 600 micro CHP per year. This means at least 600 homes and small businesses that get grid independent and generate their own energy by making also small profits by doing so. These micro CHP are prepared to work with natural gas, with the lowest emission on the marked. We are targeting the Western European country's as well the US and Canadian marked. In the second step we prepare the technology to use other liquid or gaseous renewable combustibles. By further marked penetration we like to  modify our heating system to be used in heat recovery and converting of solar energy to electricity and cooling. With that we will partnering interested companies for local independent grid solutions.With all that, our technology will contribute in short terms to the efficient use of natural resources and make people grid independent.  Together we make the differenceWe also like to get in touch with individuals and company's that are interested in local grid development and self building projects around the world. The more funds we raise, the more specific burners and possibilities can we provide. With that we can build service teams to provide the local needed development know-how.  Our outreach is to share the technology and the idea about home made energy self efficiency. Please share the project with your contacts.Inside of the engineDemo plant engine with 400 Nm torque at 300 rpm. Engine block in casted iron.The PerksSince we are convinced that renewable energy is part of our future life we also try not to overstress natural resources.  We will provide some gifts for example that we pay you some of your used kilowatts over the next years. The idea is that you have us in your mind and may be one day you are a owner of a micro CHP. Of course we like that you buy one of ours. Further we give away drawings parts or engines for those who like to build their own steam engine process. We think that with every engine we give away the energy community will be more focused on efficient local heat and power generation.Please take out your last energy invoice and think about it.
