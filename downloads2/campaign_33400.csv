<p> </p></div>","You always wanted to be a part of a Space Program, right? Now, the good news is – you don’t need to spend 12 years of heavy training to become part of this real Space Mission! How come?
Because – right now - you are about to start your own personal Space Program. Beside receiving some cool Perks for your contribution, you'll get various levels of authorization to become part of our international Remote Controlled Spacecraft Mission Control Team.
Come and join us!

 

We’re determined - and on track - to create a privately funded, insanely efficient space program. In this first phase we are designing a nano-sat - a small satellite - that will carry a Space Telescope into Earth orbit. And... we need you to help us build our team, and... to become it's member!
 

You will join a team of real Space-Tech and Media experts. We will involve you in our actions, and provide you with the excitement of participating in a real Space Exploration Mission. You’ll be a part of this  space mission right from your chair. All you have to have is a computer.
 
You will be joining an amazing synergy of expertise from all across our planet. All you have to do is be smart (by arriving at this web-page you proved that already : ), have a PC, and know some stuff about space. And we’ll show you the rest.
Become a member of our international team, and help us show the world what amazing things mankind can do when acting together with the same goals!
 

Some unique presents are waiting for you. For example: Mind-blowing psychedelic real-time space art (for your eyes only), cool metallic membership cards with your name and your mission title, some stylish T-shirts, 3-D lenticular prints with amazing space images and your name on it, and... well.. read more about our Perks at the bottom of this page, and watch-out for updates about what those Perks will look like... 

 

Upon reception of ultra-cool authorizations - you'll be able to do the following:


Monitor our spacecraft in flight

Talk/Chat with or join our Mission Control Crew

Communicate and report strange sightings
Control The Space Telescope's Camera
Take your first space photos
Analyze telemetry and sensor data
Search for near-earth objects/asteroids



You will gain exclusive rights to send your text messages via our Orbiting Spacecraft. Imagine - you'll be able to send mission-certified messages from space to your Mom, Dad, Friends, and... well... Lovers ;-). Your messages will have exclusive Synergy Moon Orbital Spacecraft logo. Perhaps you would like to send special video message to the World?
 
All in all - you can end up saving the earth from an asteroid, or be the first to notice extraterrestrials and perhaps communicate with them! In the worst-case scenario - you'll be able to watch LIVE images and videos from Space, and send exclusive Mission-certified messages - from Space - to your loved ones.
 

NanoSats are like the killer apps of space exploration – miniature and affordable satellites that can be designed, built, launched, and operated by a small group of experts. Our first NanoSat is a miniature Space Telescope which we will ""park"" in Low Earth Orbit. This Space Telescope Nanosat will then fly around the Earth providing a wide variety of scientific and edutainment applications.
 

We will design, construct, launch, and operate a NanoSat Spacecraft that will carry miniature Telescope into Earth orbit. The most crucial element of this spacecraft will be the Attitude Determination and Control System, which will allow us to aim the telescope at the desired targets and keep them in focus. 
 
We will use the funds raised here to acquire this space-qualified Attitude Determination and Control System for the Space Telescope, for NanoSat construction and launch, as well as for organizational development that will help us create the information technology infrastructure for this mission.


We’re Team Synergy Moon, an international group of techies, scientists, artist, adventurers and space-enthusiasts from all over the world.
Our team is proud to be participating in the Google Lunar X PRIZE, competing to be the first private team to put a robotic rover equipped with HD cameras on the Moon in 2015!

The primary consulting experts for this project are Gerard Auvray and Kevin Myrick – both members of Team Synergy Moon.
Gerard Auvray is a French electronics engineer who designs and builds amateur satellites.  Gererd was President of AMSAT-F for two years.  In 1993 he was responsible for the satellite ARSENE launched by Ariane.  In 1997, 1998 and 1999 he built the 3 small replicas of Sputnik launched by a Cosmonaut during his Extra Vehicular Activity from the Russian Space Station MIR. 
In 2002 , he launched 2 payloads from the third stage of an Ariane Rocket.  Today, he is building a solar sail named Libellule (Dragonfly).  Gerard also supports 2 french student picosatellite projects, is a communications consultant for two Google Lunar X PRIZE teams and is co-designer of Interorbital Systems TubeSat. 
Kevin Myrick - I am the founder and CEO of InterPlanetary Ventures, and co-founder of Team Synergy Moon, co-founded by another member of our crew -Nebojsa Stanojevic. Our Mission and Motto is Getting People Into Space!  I am a Technologist with degrees in Computer Science and Information Technology with over 25 years of experience in software development for online applications and data center management. 

Astronomical Society of Vidulini, Croatia - will be responsible for the construction of the NanoSat Space Telescope.  AUV (Astronomska Udruga Vidulini) is the space exploration technologies development group of Team Synergy Moon. AUV has created a series of networked telescopes and sent various scientific instruments to stratospheric altitudes.  Recently - as part of the Google Lunar X PRIZE Team Synergy Moon - they built a working prototype of the robotic lunar rover.

Pleiades Astronomical Society (PAS) of Tuzla, Bosnia & Herzegovina will manage Space Telescope’s Mission.  With over 150 space enthusiasts supervised by leading engineers and scientist - PAS will take care of satellite’s remote control, as well as reception, processing and distribution of scientific data.
 
 
 

Our remote-controlled spacecraft - NanoSat Space Telescope - will have following elements and functions:

Telescope - to view/image the Earth, the Moon, Planets and Stars
Imaging chips - to record video or still images from the telescope
Radio receiver and transmitter - to receive command and control signals and to send data and messages to earth or into the space
Active attitude control system - to navigate and aim the telescope
For the flight control and some other key operations of our NanoSat Space Telescope project - we ordered the Arduino-based Firefly Board - developed by Kentucky Space.
For custom applications and experiments involving the telescope and other sensors we will use the S series Gravity Development Board (GDB) from Solar System Express. 
Spacecraft's on-board electronics will send telemetry and image data which will be further processed using earth based E series GDB by our Mission Control Team, and perhaps - you -as our team's proud member : )
 


 
Our Education and Outreach partners around the world will facilitate workshops for interested teachers and student using the Synergy Space website, developed as part of this initial project.  The websites and apps will make this telescope available to anyone who wants to be a part of Space 2.0 - Space for Everyone!
 
 

All membership cards and certificates will be processed and shipped as soon as this campaign is completed, and you are going to love these items!  We're making them very special to show our appreciation for all of you, our supporters and now our partners in the Synergy Space Program!
Access codes and access to the Synergy Space and our Orbital Spacecraft Mission website will be sent in April, 2013!  This spring we will be doing testing of the spacecraft with high altitude near space platforms, and you will have access to those missions parallel with your authorizations for the final space mission!
Check out some additional Bonus-extra Team Synergy Moon Memberships included in some of the Perks you will be receiveing here on IndieGoGo.
 
 
Launch of the Synergy Moon NanoSatellite will be in the summer of 2013, currently scheduled aboard an Interorbital Systems' Neptune microsatellite launch vehicle.  You can read about Interorbital Systems' SmallSat Launch Program to learn more.

<p>We are Fabrizio Bianchini, an artist with an international background (<a href=""http://www.jupiterfab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jupiterfab.com</a>) and Simon Coleman, an anthropologist who has worked in the dissemination of ethnographic techniques to schools in England and in collaboration with Brighton Museum, UK.</p>
<p>We work in different disciplines but have discovered that our work has an amazing amount in common. In 2011 we collaborated on a study of immigrant communities in the GTA, (one of the most multiethnic areas in the entire world)  looking at the way they relate with urban space and religion, creating a unique installation of sound and paintings in the Manifesto Community Project  (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjIADUJeanA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjIADUJeanA</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The project</strong></p>
<p>Starting from our previous collaboration and teaching how to use both art and ethnographic tools, we want to help kids and their families to discover for themselves a better knowledge of who they are, where they have come from and where they live.</p>
<p>The core of the project is a workshop with children from 10 to 15 years old that we are running in different locations within the GTA, in collaboration with several social organizations (for instance ArtHeart in Regent Park area or Toronto City Mission in Scarlbourough) that work with children and young adults.</p>
<p>During the workshop, we introduce some simple tools of our respetive fields, such as the making of portraits, carrying out interviews, and tracing family histories across time and space. Using sound recorders, after learning how to do an interview, kids go back home and interview relatives about their experiences in the GTA when they first moved to Canada and/or when they were kids. Moreover, we ask every family to lend us both an old and a new picture of the family. With all this material we work and discuss in class with the kids and we help them to express what they understood and to translate it in any form of art (a song, poem, painting...) that we will use to create a traveling art exhibition in Toronto as well as outside this area to sensibilize families and institutions about how the sense of awareness of who we are, where we live and we come from can help to become a better person and a better citizen.</p>
<p>In the attempt to create something more interactive, more visible and involving more communities and institutions, we are trying to creat<em>e a<strong> sound documentary </strong>of the entire experience using the interviews to relatives and interviews to kids too; <strong>an interactive digital record on the web</strong> where we can host all the images and interviews of the project, working on this aspect with colleagues at the Department of Anthropology at Toronto (Professor Frances Garrett and PhD candidate Matt Price) who have a wide experience in this kind of works; <strong>one or more murals</strong> using images of the pictures lent to us by families.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to complete the project in all its aspects, we would need a higher amount of money but we would be happy to receive at least something to make it happen.</p>
<p>In the last months, we received $ 5,000 by the ‘Religion in the Public Sphere’ Program of University of Toronto and the Centre for Community Partnerships, that allowed us to cover part of the starting costs. We also invested a lot of our spare time, as we genuinely think that it will help a lot of kids and families who live in difficult environments and difficult situations  but we do not have the presumption to be able to do everything by ourselves, and for this reason we decided to launch this campaign.</p>
<p>We ask for a small donation, a small sacrifice to help a lot of misfit kids and families to improve their situation, but also other ways to support us will be appreciate. We would be happy if anybody would like to offer some of his/her time and experience volunteering or advertise the project on the web or on any media...</p>

</h3>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are a group of 5 students of the University of Geneva. Our humanitarian project aims to<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> improve the quality of life of the 17 orphans of the HOPAD Children's Home orphanage, in Nepal, by providing them with the opportunity to receive a quality education.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Why do these children need us? </b></p>
<p>The HOPAD Child and Women Promotion Society (Hopeless, Orphans, Poor, Affected, Dalits), a nepali certified NGO, has been working with orphans and helpless women since 2005. This NGO has a spotless reputation and a trusting relation with the nepali government and the Eris Academy, the children's school: <a href=""http://www.hopadcwps.org.np."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hopadcwps.org.np.</a></p>
<p>In their Children Program, they focus on creating a loving and familiar environment for poor orphans. The main goal is to see them grow into<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> smart, independent, rehabilitated, self driven individuals that will succeed in society as adults. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unfortunately, the NGO is currently in great financial difficulty; this is why we’d like to intervene and support them with this project.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>We are trying to raise 3700 $(3500 CHF), 218 $ per child (200 CHF), in order to pay one school year for the 17 orphans !  </p>
<p>Every donation counts : </p>
<p>Every child needs, </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>58 $ (55 CHF) : school material</p></li>
<li><p>56$ (53 CHF) : school enrollment</p></li>
<li><p>45 $ (42 CHF) : tutor</p></li>
<li><p>38 $ (35 CHF) : uniform</p></li>
<li><p>13 $ (10 CHF): governmental taxes (5%)</p></li>
<li><p>8 $ (5 CHF) : exams fee </p></li>
</ul>
<p>We guarantee that the totality of the funds raised (even if we don’t reach or exceed our desirable sum) will go to the HOPAD Children's HOME to pay for their education.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Conscious of our privilege of having access to a high quality education, we fight for a greater equity, that would allow all the children to have this fundamental right.</span><br/></p>
<p>We truly believe that education is key in eradicating poverty. This children don't have parents to provide them with the basic right that is a basic education.</p>
<p>We care so much about this little ones and are ready to do everything it takes to achieve our objective.</p>
<p>We want to be as transparent as possible, that is why all our donors can ask us for more information (about the project, where their money goes, goals achieved, etc.) any time and without hesitation. We will post photos and details information about the children's school year on our website once we reach the necessary funds : <a href=""http://the-lighthouse.wix.com/unige."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://the-lighthouse.wix.com/unige.</a></p>
<p>We do not limit ourselves by sharing our project on the internet, we also organize fundraising activities in our University in Geneva.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>We’ve set up a deadline for collecting money, which is 10th of December. Therefore, our biggest challenge is to collect the required amount by this date. </p>

We are a group of 5 students of the University of Geneva. Our humanitarian project aims to improve the quality of life of the 17 orphans of the HOPAD Children's Home orphanage, in Nepal, by providing them with the opportunity to receive a quality education.

Why do these children need us? 
The HOPAD Child and Women Promotion Society (Hopeless, Orphans, Poor, Affected, Dalits), a nepali certified NGO, has been working with orphans and helpless women since 2005. This NGO has a spotless reputation and a trusting relation with the nepali government and the Eris Academy, the children's school: http://www.hopadcwps.org.np.
In their Children Program, they focus on creating a loving and familiar environment for poor orphans. The main goal is to see them grow into smart, independent, rehabilitated, self driven individuals that will succeed in society as adults. Unfortunately, the NGO is currently in great financial difficulty; this is why we’d like to intervene and support them with this project.


What we need

We are trying to raise 3700 $(3500 CHF), 218 $ per child (200 CHF), in order to pay one school year for the 17 orphans !  
Every donation counts : 
Every child needs, 


58 $ (55 CHF) : school material
56$ (53 CHF) : school enrollment
45 $ (42 CHF) : tutor
38 $ (35 CHF) : uniform
13 $ (10 CHF): governmental taxes (5%)
8 $ (5 CHF) : exams fee 

We guarantee that the totality of the funds raised (even if we don’t reach or exceed our desirable sum) will go to the HOPAD Children's HOME to pay for their education.

The Impact

Conscious of our privilege of having access to a high quality education, we fight for a greater equity, that would allow all the children to have this fundamental right.
We truly believe that education is key in eradicating poverty. This children don't have parents to provide them with the basic right that is a basic education.
We care so much about this little ones and are ready to do everything it takes to achieve our objective.
We want to be as transparent as possible, that is why all our donors can ask us for more information (about the project, where their money goes, goals achieved, etc.) any time and without hesitation. We will post photos and details information about the children's school year on our website once we reach the necessary funds : http://the-lighthouse.wix.com/unige.
We do not limit ourselves by sharing our project on the internet, we also organize fundraising activities in our University in Geneva.

Risks and challenges

We’ve set up a deadline for collecting money, which is 10th of December. Therefore, our biggest challenge is to collect the required amount by this date.

The challenge


We are developing
these Games in an interactive all-American sports environment to make the
attractive to our children. 
More
importantly, we want to give all moms and dads, all educators the chance to
find out, secretly, how much our children already learned to be ready for Grade
1.
The results
of these Games will enable you to find out more about the challenges of your children
without stigmatizing them for the whole class. Nobody has to know if your child
has Dyslexia or ADD, but it is good to know.
It is good
to know that your child has picked up enough words, that its hand-eye
coordination is good, etc.

All these can be found after completing the 18
Games, and you may do the Games again a couple of months later to see the
improvements of your child.


What We Need & What You Get


We need $50,000 to make the Games available to all the new media: tablets, touch screen PC's and laptops with IOS, OSX, Android, and all Windows platforms. 
Pledge $ 10 or more and get 1 time free test
Pledge $ 20 or more and get 1 free test and 1 free evaluation mail
Pledge $ 50 or more and get 2 tests and evaluation by mail and phone

   The Impact

According to the National Institute
of Child and Human development, 15% of Americans have major troubles with
reading. 15% i.e. more than 47 million
US citizens.


We have been doing research on dyslexia for almost 20 years now and, according to studies at both
Stanford and Rutgers, if dyslexia were detected at a very early stage, in 80%
of the cases the brain could rewire itself and correct the learning
problem.  These studies have proven that,
after intensive training of the young child, parts of the brain rewired missing
links. 


Other Ways You Can Help
 Besides funds, we are also in need for this: We need people to share this to get the word out. There are a lot of people struggling with reading who don't know about it or are to afraid to share their issues with the community. We need you to reach out!  Thanks you for reading. We hope you all can help.

300 Christian families living in this rural area. In Pakistan, Christians are a minority and
looked down upon. They are often degraded and met with violence and are
not allowed to hold higher positions in government. Because of their choice of
religion they do not receive help. They often walk on eggshells because they
can be prosecuted if someone makes the claim (usually for blackmail or revenge)
that they said something offensive about the Muslim religion. The majority of
the Christians live in misery and are discriminated against on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The area is a rich agricultural part of the country and
different types of products are grown here. Many of the villagers work in
the fields of their landlords for very little pay which is hardly sufficient to
run their families. When they need money for their urgent needs it is borrowed
from their landlords. As it is hard to return the money this debt is
transferred to their children and they remain slaves for generations. All of
them basically belong to a labor class. There has not been a single school in
the area for this huge mass, so the boys and girls have preferred to go and
help their parents in the fields or to nearby market where they lift heavy
loads on their backs to earn extra scraps.</p>
<p> There is no
medical unit working in this area by the government. There is no first aid.
Many women die due to improper medical treatment.  The child death rate in infants and newborns is very high
due to lack of any medical help. As the people are very poor, it is hard for
them to get to the city quickly to save their lives without a vehicle. Their
common mode of transportation is a donkey cart. </p>
The
future of a nation is directly linked with the new generation. The children are
the greatest asset of this community. If we can help them get an education we
can give them hope for a better future. Education is the first step to helping
people so that they can better take care of themselves. Their parents would
love for them to get an education but they can't even consider it while they
don't even have food and clothing. It has been our good fortune to identify

privately funding a school in a highly impoverished area of Pakistan for about
a year. Philanthropy and community issues have always been an important part of
our lives. Over the years we have found ourselves helping in orphanages in
Mexico, our dad is a contractor who went to Kosovo for many months to rebuild
homes after they were bombed, we worked in foster care and adopted two kids
into our home and now we find our hearts longing to help these children in
Pakistan.

truly historic event, the first of it's kind, combining some of the most
challenging disciplines in existence, riding, martial arts and historical research. Fifteenth century
German fencing manuals call the art of combat on horseback Rossfechten. This
means not just fighting on horseback but horse and rider fighting as one. To
return this to life is our ultimate goal.  We are a group of
 HEMAists (Historical European Martial Artists)   accomplished riders
and re-enactors who are passionate about reconstructing mounted combat from
period sources in the interest of better understanding our history and
heritage. We welcome every one of you to attend, but understand that not
everyone can. If you would love to come but cannot  please make  this possible for others. Your donations can make this event
successful and<br/>most importantly annual so we can hope to see you in the future.
You can take our event from obsure and academic to EPIC!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/344589/files/20140202084213-300px-Cod.icon._394a_128v.jpg?1391359333"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>(Folio 55r of the Königswald version of Talhoffer)</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://rossfechten-symposium.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Our event website</a><br/></p>

<p>We are all scholars, riders,
fencers, re-enactors or a combination of the three and our wallets are not as
extensive as our devotion to our goal. Traveling with horses doubles the costs
for those already donating their time. Our instructors have already agreed to
work for free, and many are  flying internationally. We unfortunately
cannot cover costs purely with participation fees. To make an affordable event
that people like you can come, enjoy and learn from, we need your help.</p>
<p> We have the chance to
upgrade to the Landesgestüt Zweibrücken, a stud farm founded by Napoleon
himself, right outside Zweibrücken’s city-centre with riding facilities perfect
for our needs.Your money will pay for the location we have been offered, the
owners have already bent over backwards offering it for a fraction of the price
it usually goes for as they to want to see this succeed. We are confident we
can handle the rest of the costs. With this venue we can take more
participants and reach more people. Our event will be running at the same time
as the city fair, which annually pulls more than a hundred thousand attendees,
allowing us to reach the largest amount of people possible. This will help us
further our goal of educating people about these little known martial
and equestrian arts. And even more awesome,  find more
like-minded souls such as yourselves to swell our ranks.  And that will
ensure this event is only the beginning.</p>
<h2><b>Stretch goals</b></h2>
<p>If we meet our goal of two thousand
Euros we can start with the things that otherwise would be wishful thinking.</p>
<p><b>2800</b></p>
<p>With an extra 800 Euro we can film
the workshops, demonstrations and presentations and make them available for you</p>
<p><b>Over 2800</b></p>
<p>Every cent over 2800 goes into
bringing instructors who otherwise financially cannot attend. To have even more
prominent people giving us their input will put us effectively a year ahead of
the game.</p>

(Björn Kiefer one of our instructors, training celtic cavalry techniques with a gladiator group in Trier Germany)We have the chance to create a
truly historic event, the first of it's kind, combining some of the most
challenging disciplines in existence, riding, martial arts and historical research. Fifteenth century
German fencing manuals call the art of combat on horseback Rossfechten. This
means not just fighting on horseback but horse and rider fighting as one. To
return this to life is our ultimate goal.  We are a group of
 HEMAists (Historical European Martial Artists)   accomplished riders
and re-enactors who are passionate about reconstructing mounted combat from
period sources in the interest of better understanding our history and
heritage. We welcome every one of you to attend, but understand that not
everyone can. If you would love to come but cannot  please make  this possible for others. Your donations can make this event
successful andmost importantly annual so we can hope to see you in the future.
You can take our event from obsure and academic to EPIC!(Folio 55r of the Königswald version of Talhoffer)Our event website
What
does your money go to(Landgestüt Zweibrücken)
We are all scholars, riders,
fencers, re-enactors or a combination of the three and our wallets are not as
extensive as our devotion to our goal. Traveling with horses doubles the costs
for those already donating their time. Our instructors have already agreed to
work for free, and many are  flying internationally. We unfortunately
cannot cover costs purely with participation fees. To make an affordable event
that people like you can come, enjoy and learn from, we need your help.
 We have the chance to
upgrade to the Landesgestüt Zweibrücken, a stud farm founded by Napoleon
himself, right outside Zweibrücken’s city-centre with riding facilities perfect
for our needs.Your money will pay for the location we have been offered, the
owners have already bent over backwards offering it for a fraction of the price
it usually goes for as they to want to see this succeed. We are confident we
can handle the rest of the costs. With this venue we can take more
participants and reach more people. Our event will be running at the same time
as the city fair, which annually pulls more than a hundred thousand attendees,
allowing us to reach the largest amount of people possible. This will help us
further our goal of educating people about these little known martial
and equestrian arts. And even more awesome,  find more
like-minded souls such as yourselves to swell our ranks.  And that will
ensure this event is only the beginning.
Stretch goals
If we meet our goal of two thousand
Euros we can start with the things that otherwise would be wishful thinking.
2800
With an extra 800 Euro we can film
the workshops, demonstrations and presentations and make them available for you
Over 2800
Every cent over 2800 goes into
bringing instructors who otherwise financially cannot attend. To have even more
prominent people giving us their input will put us effectively a year ahead of
the game.
Your impact(Folio 7v of the Munich version of Talhoffer)Our academics, fencers and riders
have achieved great things in isolation, now it is time to meet and take it to
the next level and to share what knowledge we have gathered, in the form of
workshops, lectures and demonstrations. It is of utmost importance to us that
we make our passion accessible to everyone. 
Much effort and dedication has been
put in planning  a great event. We need you to bring it to the next level.
We have the chance to create a truly historic event, the first of it's kind, with some of the top riders, academics and swordsmen in the world. Donate and you become  a part of making that happen.
Our ultimate goal is to build a
community of like-minded enthusiasts across the globe. Join us now and become
part of that community.
Other Ways You
Can Help
If you can’t donate you can help us
other ways.  Share on facebook or other social media. Send a link per
email to a friend. Let a history, fencing or riding forum know about us. Spread
the word

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Srey Pov is an amazing young woman from Cambodia.  Both her parents died of aids and she was at huge risk for trafficking at the time of her rescue. While she was at a children's center in Poi Pet she worked hard to catch up on the school years she missed and became the much loved big sister of every child in the center, helping in all the mother tasks needed to take care of the children. I am so very proud to know her.</p>
<p>Srey Pov is still at serious risk, in some ways now more then ever. She is beautiful and now seventeen years old. Without a career and a way to support herself she is in danger of exploitation and sexual abuse. We have found her a home near the capital with a loving mother who is raising two adopted special needs children. Srey Pov is very happy to be in that home and be a big sister again.</p>
<p>However, we are currently looking for extra funds for her to finish high school. She has managed to get to grade 10 despite her serious set backs as a young girl. She wants to be a teacher. In order to give her the best chance of access to post-secondary education and to be the amazing teacher I know she can be I'd like to send her to a good quality school.</p>
<p>If you could donate even a little to this next school year, you'll be making a dream come true for a couragous and beauty-heart of a young women as well as securing her future saftey!</p>

Srey Pov is an amazing young woman from Cambodia.  Both her parents died of aids and she was at huge risk for trafficking at the time of her rescue. While she was at a children's center in Poi Pet she worked hard to catch up on the school years she missed and became the much loved big sister of every child in the center, helping in all the mother tasks needed to take care of the children. I am so very proud to know her.
Srey Pov is still at serious risk, in some ways now more then ever. She is beautiful and now seventeen years old. Without a career and a way to support herself she is in danger of exploitation and sexual abuse. We have found her a home near the capital with a loving mother who is raising two adopted special needs children. Srey Pov is very happy to be in that home and be a big sister again.
However, we are currently looking for extra funds for her to finish high school. She has managed to get to grade 10 despite her serious set backs as a young girl. She wants to be a teacher. In order to give her the best chance of access to post-secondary education and to be the amazing teacher I know she can be I'd like to send her to a good quality school.
If you could donate even a little to this next school year, you'll be making a dream come true for a couragous and beauty-heart of a young women as well as securing her future saftey!

What does $1000 do for our friend?

What happens if the whole funds are not raised? All the money will still be sent to the organization managing her care who will make sure she still gets an education once all the money comes in. Even if it takes time, we know it will happen. But it'd be great if she didn't have to wait any longer and if she could have the best there is!
What happens if clothes or text books end up being cheaper than the above costs? What happens to left over money? Well, we don't anticipate there being extra but if there were, it would go into the fund for the next year of schooling for Srey Pov.

<p>Rainbow Jews is a pioneering project that records
and showcases Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) history from
the 1950s to today. For the first time ever in British history, it captures the
voices and experiences of Jewish LGBT people in the UK through oral histories
and archive creation.</p>

<h2>Why We Need You</h2>Rainbow
Jews is a volunteer-led initiative, hosted by the charity Liberal Judaism, and was so far supported generously by the Lottery
Heritage Fund; the 2-year one-off grant has now finished<b>. With the current cuts in public funding we need further aid from other sources to continue our work.</b> We believe in your community spirit - and in Rainbow Jews, and we want to keep making a difference. Now we ask you, our friends and supporters, to <i>help us make this legacy go on</i>. <br/><p></p>
<h2>How Will The Money Be Spent?</h2>If we raise £5000, we will be able to cover some core costs during our UK mini tour until November 2014. <b>Your donation will help us to</b>: <div>
<br/><p>- cover staff costs for a part-time project manager, who will coordinate the volunteers, and continue to promote our key activities, such as:<br/></p>
<p>- getting this
wonderful exhibition around the country so that we can further share these amazing
stories and experiences, (We have already confirmed Leicester, Birmingham and Liverpool/Homotopia as from 31 August 2014; with more possibilities e.g. Belfast).</p>
<p>- create over 5 events such as launch receptions, film screenings and talks while touring.</p>
<p>- disseminate our education resources, and co-facilitate sessions at school, youth groups etc.</p>
<p>- recording and processing of over 10 new oral histories, especially of Jewish LGBT pioneers in remoter UK regions.</p>
<p>- collecting more memorabilia and fostering our archive collection at LMA.</p>
<p>If we raise less than £5000, we will do our best to achieve as many of our goals as possible. So far we have <a href=""http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/RainbowJewsLeicester/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">raised the costs for the Rainbow Jews </a>exhibition in Leicester thanks to generous donors of Leicester’s Jewish &amp; LGBT community
and friends.<br/></p>
<h3>What happens over £5000?</h3>
<p>If we reach our goal of £5000 that will be amazing. If we can raise funds over this amount, we'll be able to do even more. The charity Liberal Judaism will ensure that the money is used sensibly after November 2014, and for years to come, to:</p>
<p>- cover expenses for Rainbow Jews volunteers and volunteer training.<br/></p>
<p>- nurture and grow our archive collection at LMA.</p>
<p>- continue touring the RJ exhibition <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">(e.g. Limmud Conference Warwick 2014, Brighton for LGBT History Month 2015)</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">- keep organising regular community/awareness events (e.g. Brighton launch).</span></p>
<p>- keep educating the wider community about J-LGBT issues (e.g. produce toolkit)<br/></p>
<p>- sustain the Rainbow Jews Website, social media channels, and promote the initiative globally.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>There are different perks for different donation levels. You can check out the perks on the right side of this page. Not your thing? We are always happy to listen, and you can of course opt out of the rewards scheme in case you feel that saving Rainbow Jews is already enough of an incentive :).</p>

Who We are

Rainbow Jews is a pioneering project that records
and showcases Jewish lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) history from
the 1950s to today. For the first time ever in British history, it captures the
voices and experiences of Jewish LGBT people in the UK through oral histories
and archive creation.


 

Read more about this celebrated initiative, its historic exhibition launch for London LGBT History Month
2014, and the archive collection opening at the London Metropolitan Archives in May 2014, here: Rainbow Jews LGBT History Project
Rainbow Jews has numerous supporters and followers in and outside Britain, and even Stephen Fry got behind the landmark #rjexhibition launch via Twitter:


More clips, oral histories and photos can be found here, click via our Indigogo campaign Gallery (top of left tab), or via our Website or RJ You Tube Channel.


Why We Need YouRainbow
Jews is a volunteer-led initiative, hosted by the charity Liberal Judaism, and was so far supported generously by the Lottery
Heritage Fund; the 2-year one-off grant has now finished. With the current cuts in public funding we need further aid from other sources to continue our work. We believe in your community spirit - and in Rainbow Jews, and we want to keep making a difference. Now we ask you, our friends and supporters, to help us make this legacy go on. 
How Will The Money Be Spent?If we raise £5000, we will be able to cover some core costs during our UK mini tour until November 2014. Your donation will help us to: 
- cover staff costs for a part-time project manager, who will coordinate the volunteers, and continue to promote our key activities, such as:
- getting this
wonderful exhibition around the country so that we can further share these amazing
stories and experiences, (We have already confirmed Leicester, Birmingham and Liverpool/Homotopia as from 31 August 2014; with more possibilities e.g. Belfast).
- create over 5 events such as launch receptions, film screenings and talks while touring.
- disseminate our education resources, and co-facilitate sessions at school, youth groups etc.
- recording and processing of over 10 new oral histories, especially of Jewish LGBT pioneers in remoter UK regions.
- collecting more memorabilia and fostering our archive collection at LMA.
If we raise less than £5000, we will do our best to achieve as many of our goals as possible. So far we have raised the costs for the Rainbow Jews exhibition in Leicester thanks to generous donors of Leicester’s Jewish & LGBT community
and friends.
What happens over £5000?
If we reach our goal of £5000 that will be amazing. If we can raise funds over this amount, we'll be able to do even more. The charity Liberal Judaism will ensure that the money is used sensibly after November 2014, and for years to come, to:
- cover expenses for Rainbow Jews volunteers and volunteer training.
- nurture and grow our archive collection at LMA.
- continue touring the RJ exhibition (e.g. Limmud Conference Warwick 2014, Brighton for LGBT History Month 2015)
- keep organising regular community/awareness events (e.g. Brighton launch).
- keep educating the wider community about J-LGBT issues (e.g. produce toolkit)
- sustain the Rainbow Jews Website, social media channels, and promote the initiative globally.

What You Get
There are different perks for different donation levels. You can check out the perks on the right side of this page. Not your thing? We are always happy to listen, and you can of course opt out of the rewards scheme in case you feel that saving Rainbow Jews is already enough of an incentive :).



Who's Making This? Rainbow Jews is run by the wonderful team of the charity Liberal Judaism, and has been going on for almost two years because of the tireless efforts of one person, manager and founder Surat, and a growing 
community of dedicated volunteers and supporters. Find out about our team - click here Why is Rainbow Jews so important? 


""I am honoured to support Rainbow Jews and to 
celebrate the huge positive contribution that Jewish people make to the 
LGBT community and to our wider society. Jewish and LGBT people share 
many parallels of oppression and of triumph over adversity. As victims 
of prejudice, it is important for us to stand together united against 
all hate.""  (Peter Tatchell, human rights veteran) 

""Rainbow Jews provides an important source of Jewish 
history. I urge people to get involved and support this project in 
whichever way they can""
(Rabbi Danny Rich, CEO Liberal Judaism)


“Rainbow Jews doesn’t just reflect LGBT history, it reflects over 50 years of British and world Jewry, We’ve heard stories going back even further than the Holocaust, from diaspora across the continents. Identities are multifaceted, and this project shows the interconnection between faith identity and other identities. It’s about being  a cohesive comunity, working together and respecting each other. Today we can see that this has happened; we have has over 80 people donating their time, skills and energy  to Rainbow Jews.  And, I'd say  - in line with  Eurovision drag star Conchita : 'we are unstoppable!” (Surat Knan, RJ founder) 

What Else Can I Do?  


Even if you can't donate, or can only contribute a little, there's still a lot you can do: 
Help get the Rainbow Jews appeal noticed! Share this campaign everywhere you can!
Use the built-in Indiegogo share tools to spread this on your social networks.
Become a long-term supporter! The charity Liberal Judaism is able to take donations directly. Speak to us about possibilities. 


Thank you for your support.
Surat, Rainbow Jews founder and manager, and the dedicated RJ volunteer team x

A  final message from Surat, Rainbow Jews founder :'Please donate right now, so we can make sure that our history will not become our past.'

<h3>Make Me a Midwife!</h3>
<p>Help me to attend the ICTC Black Midwives and Healers Conference in Miami.</p>
<p>The world needs more midwives.  The U.S. especially needs more midwives of color. Although the United States spends the most money on maternity care than any other nation, our infant mortality rates are unacceptable for a developed nation.  African American Infants are particulary at risk by being 2-3 times more likely to die before their first birthday, than infants of other races. You can help improve the health of mothers and babies in Los Angeles and beyond by supporting my journey to becoming a Certified Professional Midwife.</p>
<p>You may ask what is a midwife?  A midwife is a professional healthcare provider who provides women's health care focusing particularly on common primary care issues, family planning and gynecologic needs of women, pregnancy, childbirth, the postpartum period and the care of the newborn.  Midwives believe that birth is a normal, natural, healthy process.  Midwifery care emphasis is on increased personalized prenatal care and low intervention birth.</p>
<p>My name is Camille Brown. I am a mother, Doula, Student Midwife, and Early Intervention Social Worker.  I discovered my passion for being a Doula after having a natural hospital birth with my first child.  I realized after the birth of my son how powerful and transformative pregnancy and birth can be.  I also realized how little informational, emotional and psychological support is typically available to women.  A little over a year ago I realized that I need to increase my skills and capacity to serve mothers and babies by becoming Certified Professional Midwife.  I am passionate about helping to improve the health outcomes of mothers and babies through informed, compassionate midwifery care.</p>
<p>In my work as a Social Worker for premature babies and children with disabilities I have seen first hand how being born too small, and too soon can affect a child his whole life. This can often lead to life long disabilities. I truly believe that many premature births can be prevented with holisitic, culturally competent midwifery care.  Midwifery is a proven safe and cost effective method of improving the birth outcomes for mothers and babies.</p>
<p>Help make me a Midwife by sending me to the ICTC Black Midwives and Healers Conference.</p>

I was visiting Nepal this summer for an independent study and to gain more hands on clinical practice. Originally my plan was to volunteer as a nurse at the hospital, College of Medical Sciences, in Chitwan, Nepal... and come back home. </p>
<p>However, it turned into something much more than what I had expected. While I was doing my rounds, I noticed there were an immense amount of patients who needed hemodialysis due to kidney failure and also patients who had a plethora of cardiac diseases, and the reason being is DIABETES. Many of these medical problems could have been prevented by early diagnosis and health education. Unfortunately, the people of Nepal can not afford regular health exams, and therefore, many are living with DIABETES AND THEY DO NOT EVEN KNOW... UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE. </p>
<p>These patients do not have medical insurance in order to receive any type of health care. Patients literally have to sell their homes and all of their belongings just to get hemodialysis, treatment, which cost about 3,500 Rupees/week  ($43.00US). That does not include the cost of hospital stay; medication, lab work, food, and other needed resources. Patients need to pay for everything out of their pocket!  When I learned this, I knew I wanted to help. I set up a meeting with the Director of College of Medical Sciences, and told him about my desire to help. He informed me that chronic diseases are drastically rising in Nepal, and the government does not provide any help for the people.  </p>
<p>With good fortune and help from the hospital I was volunteering at, I started a local Non Profit Organization in Nepal; College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation, which is correlated with Bucketts of Love – Help Save Nepal. There is a committee of doctors and nurses and well renowned community leaders, who are willing to volunteer their time and take me to the villages of Chitwan.  The goal is to provide free health care, which includes: diabetic testing, administering medication, and educating the local people about nutrition and health issues. Many people live hours away from any hospital or health post, with no access to any form of transportation.  If patients need to go to a hospital or doctor, transportation will be provided by the foundation.</p>
<p>College of Medical Sciences Diabetic Foundation (Bucketts of Love- Help Save Nepal) will make an IMMENSE impact on the lives of the people of Nepal and can change the future of Nepal’s healthcare system. </p>
<p> How can you help? Donate! You can contact me directly through email with any questions you may have. There is no “middle man” here. All donations will go through me. I am returning back to Nepal in February to start my work. I will be in direct contact with the patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and medical suppliers. Your money will be directly forwarded to the sustainability of the foundation.</p>
<p> Here is a brief breakdown of where the funds will be going:</p>
<p> $10.00 will provide $70.00 worth of medical supplies such as wound dressing, linens and educational material</p>
<p>$25.00 will provide $175.00 worth of medical equipment such as stethoscopes and blood pressure machines.</p>
<p>$25.00 will provide insulin for 50 patients</p>
<p>$50.00 will purchase an exam bed</p>
<p>$75.00 will purchase a hospital bed</p>
<p>$100.00 will provide an insulin pump for 50 patients</p>
<p>$500.00 will establish a pharmacy</p>
<p>$1,500 will establish a community lab</p>

 We have absolutely no idea what type of favor we'll have with the government and the people in charge. Myanmar has had a history of corruption, violence, genocide, and danger-- it's going to be awesome.

Have you heard of the Rohingya people? They're one of the most persecuted people group in the world. We have an opportunity to hear, tell, and share the stories of persecuted minorities groups that nobody else is covering, and not many people have heard. 
Am I risking the safety of my team and myself by being public about this here? Nonsense, we'll apply for our visa's to Myanmar once we get to Thailand :)

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>I am a South African by birth and have lived in this country for 60 years. During that time I was exposed to a number of ideologies and even went through the mandatory ""brain washing"" we called ""Citizen Service"" - an excuse to send a large number of my compatriots to fight wars that were senseless and only motivated by political agendas without any substance.</div>
<div>During my 20's I and my wife began to realize that what we saw going on around us was not how a normal Society should operate. We began to befriend a number of ""non-white"" people and became close friends with some of them. Probably the tipping point for us was the day we wanted to visit our one friend's new born in the ""Location"" and he told us that we would be arrested if the police found us there!! To cut a long story short we got him to smuggle us in and we gave the baby her gifts. </div>
<div>As strange as it may sound after 20 years of ""independence"" we still see a crying need for the upliftment of people who had come from a culture where no real opportunities were available and where they cannot see any changes that which would engender hope in a better future for themselves but, most critically, their children. The upsurge in violent, destructive service delivery protest is evidence of this.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I and my team have decided that we need to take action and create a new environment for our younger generation within which they can see opportunities for self improvement and upliftment. IF WE DO NOT PUT OUR CHILDREN ON A ROUTE OF HOPE AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS WITH WHICH TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR DREAMS WE AS A NATION AND A COUNTRY HAVE NO FUTURE!! </span></div>
<div>We reviewed what we could do and then realized that sport could be one of the greatest catalysts that, if complemented by a solid education system, could revolutionize our kid's life.</div>
<div>Of all the options Cricket came out as being the sports vehicle with the appropriate structures and characteristics. It is also the 2nd most popular sport in South Africa and carries no perceptible ""baggage"".</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">WHY CRICKET - it is a team game, it places high demands on concentration, it stimulates literacy and coordination, it requires discipline, the game structure lends itself naturally to being encoded in a Board Game, costs can be held down with innovative design. and finally a number of previously disadvantaged persons have become Super Sports stars playing a game at which South Africa is excelling globally!!</span><br/>
</div>
<div>Our decision was to use a Cricket Board Game as the primary upliftment tool.<br/>
</div>
<div>I spent the last  8 years working on developing a Cricket Board Game. It is now ready to be produced and distributed to the numerous Cricket Clinics and Academies that are striving to make a success in the disadvantaged areas. </div>
<div>This would be directly in line with our Minister of Sport's, Mr Fikile Mbablula that ""<p>""The smiles on the faces of the children are yet to reflect the sunshine in their hearts, because that moment is yet to come. ""</p>
<p>THAT TIME IS NOW!!! We can do it with Sport and specifically Cricket.</p>The impact of the game is exceptional - $US8 will provide a youngster with a game to go out and begin playing with his circle of friends thereby getting rapid grass roots acceptance of the game.</div>
<div>With a solid Cricket Theory background the individual has a better than average chance of being admitted to a dedicated Academic/Cricket hybrid schools that are now in the process of being established. And if our program produces more deserving candidates the number of these schools will increase - much like the Australian model.</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">From the initial 5</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">,000 players we hope to develop a  core group of 500 children who grasp the opportunity to become a Cricket player with both hands and have demonstrated the skill, dedication and aptitude,  With this number we will be able to place funding into developing a selected Schools to have the extra-mural infrastructure to specialize in intensive after school Cricket training. </span>

</li></ul>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>To produce a Student Traveler Cricket game costs $US8</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The impact of the game is exceptional - $US8 will provide a youngster with a game to go out and begin playing with his circle of friends under the auspices of a screened Coach/Mentor thereby getting rapid grass roots acceptance of the game.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To put the numbers in perceptive there are 25,000 schools such as those in Alexandra spread throughout South Africa!</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From those humble beginnings we can develop a ""Junior Cricket"" league that can boast 20 regions with at least 10 Teams per region. Starting from  nothing we could have up to 500 aspirant Provincial and national Cricket team contenders - all with a HOPE and a DREAM that they are working at. The balance of the funds raised will be used to suitably kit out these </span>players<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in their playing positions.</span></span><br/></p>
<p>Many of these players will also have the desire to start their own schools, work as Instructors or establish fully fledged Academies further driving the vision. </p>
<p>THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM!!</p>
<p>This Vision is about putting the facilities and the support at the point of need. In the Townships at the schools that are waging up uphill battle to make education - in its broadest sense namely building the full person both Academically and as a member of society - because of a lack of interest and what is considered ""non-essential"" activity funding.</p>
<p>If we cannot meet the goal of establishing at least 5 regions the funding raised up to that point will be put into feeding schemes for the Rural underprivileged children who are not yet of school going age via already established NGO's and Charities. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>If we do not arrest the rapid  downward spiral in lack of hope and opportunity for the under 15's in South Africa we will be faced with the worst nightmare of a society that with nothing to lose will turn in upon itself and destroy everything - whether it be good or bad. This new culture will lose all touch with the values that make a country and a people great - all focus will be on self gratification, domination, power and dominance. This tendency is blatantly apparent in our Gang scene in the Townships today. It will rapidly escalate the scenes we see in so many of our townships today where innocent babies are shot in their Mother's arm's and 3 and 4 year old children who are innocently playing on the sidewalk become the victims of gang war cross fire, children who are to afraid to go to school and a police and security force that cannot cope with the demands to protect them - this is a future that cannot be countenanced!!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am a South African by birth and have lived in this country for 60 years. During that time I was exposed to a number of ideologies and even went through the mandatory ""brain washing"" we called ""Citizen Service"" - an excuse to send a large number of my compatriots to fight wars that were senseless and only motivated by political agendas without any substance.
During my 20's I and my wife began to realize that what we saw going on around us was not how a normal Society should operate. We began to befriend a number of ""non-white"" people and became close friends with some of them. Probably the tipping point for us was the day we wanted to visit our one friend's new born in the ""Location"" and he told us that we would be arrested if the police found us there!! To cut a long story short we got him to smuggle us in and we gave the baby her gifts. 
As strange as it may sound after 20 years of ""independence"" we still see a crying need for the upliftment of people who had come from a culture where no real opportunities were available and where they cannot see any changes that which would engender hope in a better future for themselves but, most critically, their children. The upsurge in violent, destructive service delivery protest is evidence of this.
I and my team have decided that we need to take action and create a new environment for our younger generation within which they can see opportunities for self improvement and upliftment. IF WE DO NOT PUT OUR CHILDREN ON A ROUTE OF HOPE AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS WITH WHICH TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR DREAMS WE AS A NATION AND A COUNTRY HAVE NO FUTURE!! 
We reviewed what we could do and then realized that sport could be one of the greatest catalysts that, if complemented by a solid education system, could revolutionize our kid's life.
Of all the options Cricket came out as being the sports vehicle with the appropriate structures and characteristics. It is also the 2nd most popular sport in South Africa and carries no perceptible ""baggage"".

WHY CRICKET - it is a team game, it places high demands on concentration, it stimulates literacy and coordination, it requires discipline, the game structure lends itself naturally to being encoded in a Board Game, costs can be held down with innovative design. and finally a number of previously disadvantaged persons have become Super Sports stars playing a game at which South Africa is excelling globally!!

Our decision was to use a Cricket Board Game as the primary upliftment tool.

I spent the last  8 years working on developing a Cricket Board Game. It is now ready to be produced and distributed to the numerous Cricket Clinics and Academies that are striving to make a success in the disadvantaged areas. 
This would be directly in line with our Minister of Sport's, Mr Fikile Mbablula that """"The smiles on the faces of the children are yet to reflect the sunshine in their hearts, because that moment is yet to come. ""
THAT TIME IS NOW!!! We can do it with Sport and specifically Cricket.The impact of the game is exceptional - $US8 will provide a youngster with a game to go out and begin playing with his circle of friends thereby getting rapid grass roots acceptance of the game.
With a solid Cricket Theory background the individual has a better than average chance of being admitted to a dedicated Academic/Cricket hybrid schools that are now in the process of being established. And if our program produces more deserving candidates the number of these schools will increase - much like the Australian model.

From the initial 5,000 players we hope to develop a  core group of 500 children who grasp the opportunity to become a Cricket player with both hands and have demonstrated the skill, dedication and aptitude,  With this number we will be able to place funding into developing a selected Schools to have the extra-mural infrastructure to specialize in intensive after school Cricket training. 

 
What We Need & What You Get

 
To produce a Student Traveler Cricket game costs $US8
The impact of the game is exceptional - $US8 will provide a youngster with a game to go out and begin playing with his circle of friends under the auspices of a screened Coach/Mentor thereby getting rapid grass roots acceptance of the game.
To put the numbers in perceptive there are 25,000 schools such as those in Alexandra spread throughout South Africa!
From those humble beginnings we can develop a ""Junior Cricket"" league that can boast 20 regions with at least 10 Teams per region. Starting from  nothing we could have up to 500 aspirant Provincial and national Cricket team contenders - all with a HOPE and a DREAM that they are working at. The balance of the funds raised will be used to suitably kit out these players in their playing positions.
Many of these players will also have the desire to start their own schools, work as Instructors or establish fully fledged Academies further driving the vision. 
THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE DREAM!!
This Vision is about putting the facilities and the support at the point of need. In the Townships at the schools that are waging up uphill battle to make education - in its broadest sense namely building the full person both Academically and as a member of society - because of a lack of interest and what is considered ""non-essential"" activity funding.
If we cannot meet the goal of establishing at least 5 regions the funding raised up to that point will be put into feeding schemes for the Rural underprivileged children who are not yet of school going age via already established NGO's and Charities. 
The Impact
 If we do not arrest the rapid  downward spiral in lack of hope and opportunity for the under 15's in South Africa we will be faced with the worst nightmare of a society that with nothing to lose will turn in upon itself and destroy everything - whether it be good or bad. This new culture will lose all touch with the values that make a country and a people great - all focus will be on self gratification, domination, power and dominance. This tendency is blatantly apparent in our Gang scene in the Townships today. It will rapidly escalate the scenes we see in so many of our townships today where innocent babies are shot in their Mother's arm's and 3 and 4 year old children who are innocently playing on the sidewalk become the victims of gang war cross fire, children who are to afraid to go to school and a police and security force that cannot cope with the demands to protect them - this is a future that cannot be countenanced!!

  Risks & Challenges A large hurdle to overcome will be to break the hold of gangs and drug lords on the current crop of teenagers.
Fortunately society is already rising to that challenge with movement such as PAGAD in the Western Cape and large public protests in known drug lord areas in other cities.

  Other Ways You Can Help I hope that armed with this knowledge of what we MUST fight to win back our children you will share as widely as possible. Ask people you know who may have contacts into the  Cricket Equipment business or even just the ability to sew uniforms.

</h3>
<h3><span>The story</span></h3>
<p>In 2009, my travels led me to Morocco, where I was blessed to stay 
with a wonderful family and where I truly connected with a new brother, 
Hicham. Thanks to them, I felt nurtured in the midst of what became a 
big life transition. Through my unsettling culture shock, Hicham offered
 guidance and helped me to grow as an individual. Ever since then, we 
have kept contact like members of a real family. Today, my brother needs
 my help, but I cannot do it alone.</p>
<h3>A little more about Hicham</h3>
<p>Above all, Hicham is dedicated to offering local children accessible 
eye care and his greatest dream is to be of service in his hometown, 
near his parents and siblings, and start a family of his own.  Since 
I’ve known him, Hicham has used every opportunity to volunteer in his 
community and help anyone he is able to (including me).  A passionate 
and intelligent 29 year old, he is now focused on studying orthoptics, a
 type of vision therapy that has never been taught in Morocco before. As
 part of a pioneering cohort of students, he will work with children 
with eye muscle disorders, widening the range of treatment options where
 accessibility to healthcare can be a challenge.   </p>
<h3>The financial reality</h3>
<p>Amazingly, $320 USD/CAD per month pays for tuition, rent, food and 
transportation for Hicham while he’s studying in Rabat. He has tried 
everything to find funding, but things don’t work the same way in 
Morocco. There are no such things as student loans or student jobs. I have been the only one supporting him, besides our previous campaign. <strong>We are his only option now</strong>. Our goal is to raise enough for the next 3 months, while I will also be in school on my side of the world. <br/></p>
<h3>Why give today? </h3>
<p><strong>To help my brother, to help me, and to allow a dream to come true</strong>. 
 Once we have understood what it means to rely on another person during a
 trying time, we are eager to return the love that was shown to us. 
 With the solution at the tip of my fingers, I’m asking you to give 
today.  For him to be able to help kids in his community.  For him to 
have a family of his own. To pass along to others the kindnesses shown 
to us.</p>
<h2>Every little bit helps!</h2>
<h3>Thank you sincerely</h3>

<h2>Gardons Hicham à l’école - 2e prise<br/>
</h2>
<h3><em>Il ne pourra pas compléter ses études sans nous!</em></h3>
<p>
</p>
<h3>L’histoire</h3>
<p>En 2009, mes voyages m’ont emmenée au Maroc, où j’ai eu la chance 
d’être accueillie par une famille exceptionnelle et où je me suis liée 
d’une amitié fraternelle avec Hicham. Grâce à eux, j’ai reçu tout le 
support dont j’ai eu besoin au milieu de ce qui est devenu une grande 
transition dans ma vie. Hicham a agit comme un frère pour moi, offrant 
son soutien durant ce choc culturel et transformationnel, et il m’a 
vraiment aidée à évoluer en tant que personne. Nous sommes toujours 
restés en contact comme les membres d’une véritable famille. 
Aujourd’hui, mon frère marocain a vraiment besoin de mon aide, mais je 
ne peux y arriver toute seule.</p>
<h3>Au sujet d’Hicham</h3>
<p>Par dessus tout, Hicham est dédié à rendre accessible les soins des 
yeux aux enfants de sa communauté et son plus grand rêve est de le faire
 dans sa ville natale, là où il veut fonder sa propre famille auprès de 
ses parents et de ses frères et sœurs. Depuis que je le connais, il a 
toujours su maximiser chaque opportunité de pouvoir aider les autres en 
dévouant son temps et son soutien autant que possible, tout comme il l’a
 fait pour moi. Hicham est un jeune homme passionné et intelligent, 
maintenant sérieusement concentré sur ses études en orthoptie. Une 
pratique nouvellement enseignée au Maroc, il s’agit d’un secteur de 
l'ophtalmologie qui étudie et traite les troubles visuels par 
rééducation. Faisant partie du premier groupe d’étudiants en ce domaine,
 Hicham travaillera avec les enfants qui ont des problèmes de vision, 
aidant à rendre ce type the thérapie plus accessible à tous.</p>
<h3>La réalité financière</h3>
<p>Hicham a besoin de seulement 300$ USD/CAN par mois pour couvrir tous 
les frais liés à ses études, incluant les frais de scolarité, le 
logement, la nourriture ainsi que le transport. Hicham a fait beaucoup 
d’efforts afin de trouver les sommes requises pour pouvoir compléter ses
 études, mais les choses fonctionnent bien différemment au Maroc. Il n’y
 a pas de programmes de support aux études tel que des prêts et bourses 
ou même du travail pour les étudiants, comme chez nous. <strong>Nous sommes sa seule option à ce point. </strong>Notre but est d'amasser assez d'argent pour les trois prochains mois alors que je serai aussi a l'ecole de mon cote du globe. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<br/><h3>Pourquoi donner aujourd’hui?</h3>
<p><strong>Pour aider mon frère, pour m’aider moi et pour aider à ce que le rêve d’Hicham devienne réalité. </strong>Parce
 que nous avons reçu l’aide inestimable d’une personne durant des 
moments difficiles de notre vie, nous comprenons l’importance d’être là 
pour s’aider les uns les autres. Avec cette solution au bout de nos 
doigts, je vous demande de contribuer dès aujourd’hui pour qu’Hicham 
puisse aider les enfants de sa communauté. Pour qu’il puisse fonder sa 
propre famille. Pour partager avec les autres la bonté qui nous a été 
offerte. <br/></p>
<h3>Merci sincèrement!</h3>

 With the solution at the tip of my fingers, I’m asking you to give 
today.  For him to be able to help kids in his community.  For him to 
have a family of his own. To pass along to others the kindnesses shown 
to us.
Every little bit helps!
Thank you sincerely

Gardons Hicham à l’école - 2e prise

Il ne pourra pas compléter ses études sans nous!


L’histoire
En 2009, mes voyages m’ont emmenée au Maroc, où j’ai eu la chance 
d’être accueillie par une famille exceptionnelle et où je me suis liée 
d’une amitié fraternelle avec Hicham. Grâce à eux, j’ai reçu tout le 
support dont j’ai eu besoin au milieu de ce qui est devenu une grande 
transition dans ma vie. Hicham a agit comme un frère pour moi, offrant 
son soutien durant ce choc culturel et transformationnel, et il m’a 
vraiment aidée à évoluer en tant que personne. Nous sommes toujours 
restés en contact comme les membres d’une véritable famille. 
Aujourd’hui, mon frère marocain a vraiment besoin de mon aide, mais je 
ne peux y arriver toute seule.
Au sujet d’Hicham
Par dessus tout, Hicham est dédié à rendre accessible les soins des 
yeux aux enfants de sa communauté et son plus grand rêve est de le faire
 dans sa ville natale, là où il veut fonder sa propre famille auprès de 
ses parents et de ses frères et sœurs. Depuis que je le connais, il a 
toujours su maximiser chaque opportunité de pouvoir aider les autres en 
dévouant son temps et son soutien autant que possible, tout comme il l’a
 fait pour moi. Hicham est un jeune homme passionné et intelligent, 
maintenant sérieusement concentré sur ses études en orthoptie. Une 
pratique nouvellement enseignée au Maroc, il s’agit d’un secteur de 
l'ophtalmologie qui étudie et traite les troubles visuels par 
rééducation. Faisant partie du premier groupe d’étudiants en ce domaine,
 Hicham travaillera avec les enfants qui ont des problèmes de vision, 
aidant à rendre ce type the thérapie plus accessible à tous.
La réalité financière
Hicham a besoin de seulement 300$ USD/CAN par mois pour couvrir tous 
les frais liés à ses études, incluant les frais de scolarité, le 
logement, la nourriture ainsi que le transport. Hicham a fait beaucoup 
d’efforts afin de trouver les sommes requises pour pouvoir compléter ses
 études, mais les choses fonctionnent bien différemment au Maroc. Il n’y
 a pas de programmes de support aux études tel que des prêts et bourses 
ou même du travail pour les étudiants, comme chez nous. Nous sommes sa seule option à ce point. Notre but est d'amasser assez d'argent pour les trois prochains mois alors que je serai aussi a l'ecole de mon cote du globe. 
Pourquoi donner aujourd’hui?
Pour aider mon frère, pour m’aider moi et pour aider à ce que le rêve d’Hicham devienne réalité. Parce
 que nous avons reçu l’aide inestimable d’une personne durant des 
moments difficiles de notre vie, nous comprenons l’importance d’être là 
pour s’aider les uns les autres. Avec cette solution au bout de nos 
doigts, je vous demande de contribuer dès aujourd’hui pour qu’Hicham 
puisse aider les enfants de sa communauté. Pour qu’il puisse fonder sa 
propre famille. Pour partager avec les autres la bonté qui nous a été 
offerte. 
Merci sincèrement!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Who We Are // Meet Valentina</strong></h3>
<p>Valentina is a <strong><em>former Italian field hockey player</em></strong> with a master in Psychology who is now working in the International Cooperation Sector in Tanzania. In this area there are several problems regarding education, health and women empowerment among others, and sports can be an opportunity to step forward in creating a better future for people. Valentina is <strong><em>based in Dar es Salaam</em></strong> since the end of January 2013, with <strong><em>an only dream in mind: “Bringing the Tanzanian Ladies Field Hockey National team to Kenya”</em></strong>. It all started when she met people playing field hockey in the streets in her previous experiences in Tanzania back in 2012. Last April the Dar es Salaam Hockey Association re-introduced the hockey school programme, utilizing the equipment that arrived from Italy (thanks to Valentina), aimed at promoting field hockey among youth. Besides, in May the <strong><em>Tanzanian Hockey Association asked Valentina to coach the Female National Team</em></strong> in order to participate in the African Nation Cup that will be held in Nairobi, Kenya, from September the 26th  to October the 6th 2013. She accepted immediately: “As a former national team player, coaching a national team is just a dream that could come true!!”. So they started to gather all the girls and to train everyday in the morning at Lugalo Hockey Field.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Although field hockey has been played in Tanzania since the early 20th Century, nowadays it’s still not as popular as other sports in the country. In the whole country there are <strong><em>few men teams and only one female team</em></strong>, which is also the national team. In the last years the Tanzanian Hockey Association has chosen to support the males team to, destining to them the poor resources offered by the Government to the “minority” sports.  But today the Tanzanian Ladies National team has the chance to participate in <strong>Africa Nation Cup</strong>, a tournament that is valid as a Qualifier for the 2014 World Cup. This prestigious competition will be hosted in Nairobi from <strong>September the 26th to October the 6th 2013</strong>. The Tanzanian Hockey Association hasn’t got funds for this, so is looking for support in order to be able to cover the costs related to the participation in the tournament, such as tournament fee, travel fees to Nairobi or accommodation for two weeks abroad. For doing so, <strong>10.000€</strong> are needed.</p>
<p>If you can only give 20€, or 10€, or even 1€ it will truly make a difference. <strong>A little goes a long way</strong>, and every cent will be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Many times the Tanzanian Ladies team was supposed to participate to international competitions in other African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, where hockey is more developed and widespread. But they always failed to go because of the lack of money from sponsor.</p>
<p>If we achieve our goal, for the <strong>Ladies Team</strong> will be the <strong>first time</strong> to represent their country in an official international competition!</p>
<p>The present campaign has the purpose to present our challenge to go to Nairobi and we truly hope that some of our friends worldwide will <strong>help us</strong> to achieve  our <strong>dream. </strong>And yes, <strong>YOU can</strong> help with our case and <strong>make an impact</strong>.</p>

<h3><b>This Project</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Help us launch our next youth and public arts
project designed to take place in two Malian refugee camps in the Sahel of
Niger from September to December 2013. Called <b><i>Energizing Refugee
Communities Through Art</i></b>, we created this project in order to share the
power of art with refugee communities, knowing that there are few opportunities
for self-expression and cultural representation in refugee camps. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8612/files/20130812203402-Group2.jpg?1376364842"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Malian youth in Abala Refugee Camp 2013 PHOTO: courtesy of ACTED<p></p>
<p><br/>
The Malian refugee crisis began in early 2012, when violent conflict in
Mali forced thousands of Malian men, women and children to leave their homes
and flee across the border into Niger where they have been housed in multiple
refugee camps.<i> Colors of Connection</i> will work with 36
youth to create murals in public spaces in two of these camps: Abala which
houses approximately 13,000 refugees and Mangaizé, home to 7,000. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span></span></b></p>
<h3><b>The Impact:</b></h3></span><p></p>
<p>Our project will encourage 36 Malian youths'
capacity for personal achievement through self-expression and creativity, while
enhancing their civic interest and engagement and fostering their role as
positive contributors to society. In addition, we will train a youth artist in
each camp on how to teach and execute a community arts project to increase
sustainability and use of the arts in Abala and Mangaizé Camps. Lastly, the
murals that will be created in Mangaizé and Abala Refugee Camps will affirm the
hopes and dreams of the 20,000 Malian refugees in Abala and Mangaizé Refugee
Camps.<br/><br/><i>Colors of Connection</i> is a youth arts organization that enables
connections between people and communities through creative expression. </p>
<p><br/>
This project has been approved by the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR,
and has been positively reviewed by the refugee populations in Abala and
Mangaizé Refugee Camps.</p>
<p><br/>
In these two refugee camps where the focus is solely on survival, we
believe that this project will bring a special therapeutic energy that will
help people believe in more than their immediate reality and imagine a positive
future. It will allow them to connect with each other through their common
hopes and dreams and focus on what’s most important to them.<br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span><p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The total project budget is $27,500. We are
thrilled that our partners who manage Abala and Mangaizé Refugee Camps, Agency
for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED)  and Islamic Relief
Worldwide (IRW), will support logistical and transportation expenses of
$12,600. Your support will cover a part of the remaining costs which includes
supplies for mural painting $2,100, youth participant expenses $500,
administrative expenses $2,150 and contingency $1,200. If we make the 6k goal
we have set on Indiegogo, we will reach 65% of our total budget and are
optimistic that through grants and other support we will be able to launch this
project at the end of September.<br/>
Our perks include matching you with one of the 36 vulnerable refugee youth
we work with and updating you on their growth and development during the
project. Other perks are drawings sent to you and created by these youth,
photographs of the project and even having your name on one of the murals!

<h3><b>The Difference Your Contribution Will Make</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p> As is the case in humanitarian
emergencies, aid agencies focus on the basic needs and opportunities for
creative development are rare to non-existent. However in situations of crisis
like this one, creative energy can help to meet the severe psychological
challenges that refugees experience, including displacement, cultural bereavement,
and disruption of community and social support networks. Community arts
projects like the ones <i>Colors of Connection</i> will carry
out can introduce activities that build vibrant civil society, portray values
and culture, provide a platform for self-representation, and help to address
psychological adversities in the lives of refugees.<br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span></span></b></p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>During these three months, we will create a
local community arts council in each camp and bring together 18 youth (9 girls
and 9 boys) from each camp. Together we will mobilize to transform these
refugee camps into environments which express the hopes and dreams for the
future of Malian Refugees through the creation of 2 murals. 36 youth will be
given bi-weekly classes in the arts which will incorporate arts activities aimed
at addressing the psychosocial needs and adversities that they face. These
youth will have the opportunity to engage creatively in transforming their camp
communities. Because older youth in refugee camps around the world receive less
services and support from government and aid agencies than younger youth, we
will work with female and male youth aged 12-18 in these camps.<b style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></b></p>

<p><b>Sophie Finds a Friend- a book for children on the autism spectrum.</b></p><p>We are so excited to introduce to you the
opportunity to support the Sophie Finds a Friend book project!<span>  Many people have already stepped up to
support the effort to get this book published! We are getting closer and closer
everyday, and with a little more help, we will be able to deliver this
wonderful resource to teacher, parents and service dog organizations! </span></p>
<p>With the rising diagnosis for children on the
autism spectrum, this book was created to introduce young children to the
emotions of happy and sad and the corresponding emotion in dogs. Please show your support by making a
contribution (no contribution is too small- or too big!) to this extremely
worthwhile project. </p>
<p><b>The Book!</b></p>
<p>The book is starring “Sophie"" a small,
round, fat, yellow Labrador puppy as she goes through an adventure where she
discovers and reacts with her emotions and empathy. As autistic children often
have difficulty understanding and showing emotions, Sophie non-verbally shares
her emotions with a shy boy. The book helps promote learning and understanding
of the dog and their sharing of the connection to emotions and empathy. By
showing emotion and empathy from a dog’s point of view, it encourages children
and adults connect with their humaneness and empathy for other people and
animals.</p>
<p>Also included in the book are
""Tips and Resources for Parents and Teachers"" that shows parents,
teachers and therapists how to use the book and some additional resources on
dogs, service dog organizations, and the relationship between children and
nature (dogs). All illustrations were hand painted in watercolor by the author.</p>
<p>Recent research indicates that
early intervention can help children with communication issues and increase
adaptation to their environment. Stanford University is currently researching
early intervention therapies for children at the infant/toddler range. This is
a perfect book for dog lovers as well! It can be used for any child between the
ages of 18 months to 4 years. They will love Sophie!</p>
<br/><p><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/411086/files/20140304163551-ball.jpg?1393979751"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>My purpose!</b></p>
<p>My purpose of the book is
twofold. One, to create a book using sweet, lovable puppy discovering and
learning things children need to learn- emotions and empathy. Young children
are introduced to the non-verbal communication of the dog as well as
reinforcing the concepts of happy and sad. Perhaps one day a child on the
autism spectrum will have a ""Sophie"" of their own to help bridge
social and developmental challenges. </p>
<p>The second purpose is to introduce
elements of Humane Education to teach parents and educators about the emotions
of dogs and the relationship between humans and nature. The insightful books
Minding Animals by Marc Bekoff and the Biophilia Hypothesis by Wilson/Kellert,
inspired me to create a project where I could bring nature (the relationship of
humans and dogs) to children that struggle with learning emotional connections.
Biophilia literally means “love of life or living systems”. Additionally, the
book <u>Children and Nature</u> by Kahn and Kellert, describes the particularly
close relationship of children with nature, especially animals.  The
connection between humans and nature (dogs) may impact the very nature of our well-being. </p>
<p><b>Some of the research!</b></p>
<p>Professional and educational
studies explore canine early learning, fearfulness, socialization, personality
testing and emotion in dogs and puppies. Research has been done on the
processes of providing service dogs for people with Autism. This research
includes information on the success rate, the welfare of the dogs, their personality
testing and how dogs are placed. </p>
<p>Studies show early education
and relationship-based therapy for young children on the Autism spectrum has
success with developmental awareness and cognition. Dogs are being introduced
into these therapies in more and more ways. Dogs are also being used in homes
and clinics to help create a calm environment, bridge social gaps and have been
shown to increase empathetic awareness in children with ASD.  I strongly
feel that through the processes of humane education backed by the Biophilia Hypothesis,
we can reach out and help these children connect with these special dogs at
critical stages of early learning.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I'm raising funds to self publish the book though
Lulu.com!! This company will guide me through the entire process of publishing
the book. Over the last year I have created the story and illustrations and I
am ready to publish! Lulu.com will provide copy-editing, cover design and
production, publicity and marketing tools. The best part is that they will also
grant the book an ISBN number, and place it on the Amazon marketplace for sale
around the world! Lulu is a POD (Print on Demand) resource, so my book will
always be available and never out of stock! People will be able to order any
quantity they need and have it shipped directly to them!</p>
<p>Once the book is published, we will partner with
nonprofit service dog organizations specializing in Autism service dogs, include
Autism parent-support sites and therapists to help spread the word about this
important work and get this book to the children and parents that need it.</p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is to raise
     $5,000. About $1500- 2000 will go towards the Lulu.com set up, ISBN
     number, marketing and placement on Amazon.com and other worldwide
     distributions. </li>
<li>$1000 will be raised to publish
     and send the books out with my perks. (See my PERKS!)</li>
<li>The remainder of any
     funds will be used to print additional books to send out to non-profit
     organizations (service dogs and autism/parent resource groups) libraries
     and therapist offices.</li>
<li>If we fall short of our
     goal, every penny will be used to reach as many people as we can. And YOU
     can participate and help me accomplish this worthwhile effort by just donating
     any amount or by purchasing a copy of the book in my PERKS page! The book
     is charming, delightful and suitable for a child of any age. Get several
     for your children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren! The book would also make a wonderful baby shower gift! By participating in
     this fundraiser, you will be supporting children with autism and their parents by helping the children connect to their
     emotions, their dogs and to each other!</li>
<li>If we
     are able to go over target, we intend to manufacture a small Sophie stuffed
     animal to go along with the book, so the children will have a dog to pet! We
     are also planning a follow up book to help children with other challenges
     faced by children on the autism spectrum such as safety and preventing
     flare ups or melt-downs.</li>

<p>Friends and family,</p>

<p>That being said, <strong><i>this November I will head to Antigua, Guatemala for one week as a volunteer speech pathologist to provide speech therapy to young Guatemalans with repaired cleft lip and/or palate.  My goal with this campaign is to be able to provide speech therapy materials and Spanish language books for the children and teens at the camp, in addition to some teaching materials for newly-trained Guatemalan speech therapists.</i> </strong> </p>
<p>Keep reading to understand  these childrens' journey's....</p>
<p>Please take a look at the video of the babies and children during pre- and post-surgery of cleft lip and palate.  Their young lives started with quite a bit of trauma with feeding and suckling difficulties, struggling to maintain adequate nutrition and making attempts to babble.  Throughout their early years they received a number of medical evaluations and dramatic surgeries to repair their facial and oral anomalies.  Now, imagine them years later, after many would believe they had overcome their hardships, only for them to continue to be teased and made to feel inadequate because of persistent speech and articulation issues.  This is where Campamento Sonrisas makes its lasting positive impact.  The two-week camp organized by Tess Unlimited (a non-profit organization--  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TESSUnlimited/?fref=ts)%C2%A0provides"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/TESSUnlimited/?fref=ts...</a> training and speech therapy to children, parents, new Guatemalan speech therapy graduates, and other local community and global volunteers.  Volunteer psychologists  from across the globe also contribute their time.</p>
<p>Below I've listed the items that will be purchased in order to supply the camp with materials and books:</p>
<p>Disposable gloves, tongue depressors, straws, small mirrors, oral &amp; nasal listener (ONL), alcohol wipes, Spanish articulation assessment (from TPT--no norms), 2 stethoscopes, lysol wipe packs, simple therapy games, (possible See-Scope therapy tool for nasal emission), Spanish language books/magazines for 10-20 year olds</p>
<p>SO...again, I thank you in advance for supporting these children who otherwise would not have access to therapy.  I hope you can contribute to help me reach this goal! Be sure to check back in for my report  of the fundraising progress and the pictures from Guatemala!!!!!</p>

<p>MEN, vi trenger DIN hjelp. Vi må samle inn nok penger til å dekke reise utgifter, vaksinasjoner, Visum, utstyr til prosjektene men også utstyr til skolene i Ghana.  Lightyear Foundation er en liten organisasjon som kan kun gjøre sitt arbeid gjennom sonsorship og vennlige folk/venner/familie som vil donere penger til dette prosjektet. </p>
<p>Prosjektet varer altså 2 uker og vi skal hovedsakelig holde undervisnings timer/presentasjoner  innenfor forskjellige miljøvennlige måter å lage energi (vi skal hjelpe lærere i å lage sol paneler) og rense vann (rensing av vann er et stort (og dyrt) problem i Afrika, men kan bli løst på en enkel måte individuelt), men vi skal også engasjere elever i å lære naturvitenskap på nye måter. YEY!</p>
<p>Det er da første gang Craig og jeg skal arbeide sammen og vi gleder oss kjempe masse!!=) Vi håper også at dette kan lede til andre muligheter til å jobbe med veldedighets organisasjoner verden over i årene framover. Vi har alltid hatt store ambisjoner i å gjøre verden mer miljøvennlig og vi tror dette prosjektet er en begynnelse på noe stort.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HVA VI TRENGER OG HVA DU VIL FÅ UT AV DET</strong></p>
<p><strong>Målet vårt er å få samlet opp £500 som da er ca 5000kr før den 7. Juni, 2013. </strong></p>
<p>Pengene dere donerer kommer til å bidra til:</p>
<p>-  Utstyr til de forskjellige presentasjonene/undervisnings timer (dette er da utstyr til 10 forskjellige skoler)</p>

Post my fellowship, I am co-starting a learning centre for empowering underprivileged girls in Sangam Vihar, an urban slum located in the heart of New Delhi, India which is the community where I currently teach.</p>
<p>The idea is to establish a learning hub focused towards educating girls to become community leaders and torchbearers of change for facilitating development and upliftment of their communities. With a strong focus on teaching social science and science to primary-level girls, belonging to both English and vernacular medium, the hubs will endeavour to use activity and project based learning as teaching tools to support their growth into responsible community leaders implementing community empowerment projects. English language skills would be imparted to high school girls using phonics program after which the girls would be involved with and trained to teach in our centers as we expand. Community impact projects will be pursued with women from the community engaging them in health awareness workshops. Weekends would be utilized in organizing Dance, Crafts, Arts and Self Defence classes for give to give effect to our objective of providing wholesome education.

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Innumerable hurdles exist for students enrolled in government-run schools looking for a meaningful education. In these schools, there is an acute dearth of teachers and, unfortunately, even those few who have the privilege of having a teacher present are not taught properly. As a result, these promising girls are denied opportunities to receive wholesome education, severely denting their chances to improve their lives. Our centre aspires to give these girls a meaningful, wholesome and well-rounded education to tap their inner potential and use it to effect change in their communities. We aim to reach out to more than 500 girls in our first phase.</p>
<p>For my previous experience, you can have a detailed look at the team's experiences and achievements <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=57775339&amp;trk=tab_pro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

The Impact
Innumerable hurdles exist for students enrolled in government-run schools looking for a meaningful education. In these schools, there is an acute dearth of teachers and, unfortunately, even those few who have the privilege of having a teacher present are not taught properly. As a result, these promising girls are denied opportunities to receive wholesome education, severely denting their chances to improve their lives. Our centre aspires to give these girls a meaningful, wholesome and well-rounded education to tap their inner potential and use it to effect change in their communities. We aim to reach out to more than 500 girls in our first phase.
For my previous experience, you can have a detailed look at the team's experiences and achievements here.
Other Ways You Can Help
You can help us get the word out in your circles and networks.
We thank you for all your support! Any and every contribution takes us one step closer towards ensuring meaningful education for girls of Sangam Vihar, New Delhi.",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Launching this August, 2013


You may be aware of the massive demonstrations, protests, human tragedies and revolutions currently happening in the Middle East. The energy of hatred is spreading like a virus and peace-loving people are being persecuted in their own countries.       
As we become aware of these human atrocities that affect us so deeply in our hearts, we often ask ourselves,
How can we help, especially for those of us who are so far away?

How can we unify on mass scale to create planetary peace?
 


THE GLOBAL PEACE OPERATIONS BE PART OF A SOLUTION

What is the Global Peace Operations?1. Creating a network of Peace Emissaries in active and focused planetary service2. Coordinated and timely peace transmissions to areas of conflict3. Peace delegations traveling to these regions to have a physical presence4. Software app development for instant notifications of the peace transmissions5. Building program awareness through social marketing

The Global Peace Operations is a self-organizing plan to build a network of 144,000 passionate people committed to peace who can all be interlinked, in an instant, through mobile technology.
We are placing ourselves in service to be used as one group instrument through which the streams of love can be transferred into trauma-zones, creating a grid of peace while transforming the imprints of separation.It is from our ONE unified consciousness, in full focused action, that is our greatest influencing power to create lasting change.We are calling forth all Ambassadors of Peace to team up with us and... AWAKEN PROFOUND PEACE! 

MEDITATION JOINS WITH TECHNOLOGY TO BRING PEACE 


YOUR APP FOR PEACE!

We are developing a Global Peace Operations App, allowing all of us to simultaneously receive notifications for: Awakening Profound Peace. (APP)
You know instantly when a Peace Meditation is about to take place, a time when all of us can spontaneously drop in at the same powerful moment, to beam our love and light to the intense pockets of energy on our planet.  
YOUR MEDIA FEEDS FOR PEACE!
To support the Awakening Profound Peace alerts... videos, photos and media feed updates will be offered to reveal the demonstrations of love that you are participating in, the impact you are making and the miraculous story that is unfolding in front of our eyes. 


AWAKEN PROFOUND PEACE and link up with us now!

 


SCIENTIFIC PROOF ASSURES OUR COLLECTIVE QUEST

Since the inception of Children of the Sun Foundation in 2007, its platform of global volunteers has been proving, through direct experience, what scientists have been testing in laboratory and extensive field studies for decades.  

            

A plethora of quantifiable scientific research consistenly offers the sound evidence that group prayers and meditations of geographically separated individuals can promote peace, health and beneficial behavior for others also located over great distances.  
See Our Results: Scientific Backing for Children of the Sun FoundationRead Further Evidence: PermanentPeace.org, Institute of Heart Math Research
 
  We actually have a technology of peace. We can manfiest peace in the world. It is just a matter of support to bring groups together sufficiently large to co-create this influence.  Craig Pearson PhD, Vice President, Maharishi University of Management, USA

See Video.
Our work has been tested with proven results. Our network of volunteers are now trained and prepared to help in this collective movement into the world to command the changes.

<p>On August 9, I published an article in the Daily Beast on
the dynamics of refugee assistance in Maban County, South Sudan. The article

<p>On the most recent national tests, Tagwa scored the highest in the entire country. She finished primary school this year but without assistance will be unable to continue her education.

The Open Arms Project is our attempt to reach out to the community and serve with midwifery care.  It is our goal to accept these families into our care, for little to no cost, and love them through the journey of pregnancy and birth, just as each and every family deserves.  We will accept donations of both money and supplies, as well as work to be approved to accept medicaid. (At this time we are awaiting final approval).  In order to serve as many families as possible, we have taken 3000 square feet in the building just next to Central Texas Birth Center. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/286722/files/20140101141213-IMG_20131203_230014158_1_.jpg?1388614333"" src="""" style=""""/></p> We have 3 beautiful tub rooms for waterbirths and 2 additional labor rooms.  <div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to begin immediately accepting families into the Open Arms Program, we need $85,000. The costs to pay a midwife, an assistant, and cover costs for supplies, is approximately $1500 per birth.  The funds received from this campaign will be able to cover 10 births per month through 6 months.  That's at least 60 families who have the benefit of midwifery care!  We are currently in the process to accept medicaid, and if approved, can bill retroactively back to the date we applied.  Our goal is to be self sufficient for 6 months at which time we will have a better idea if we will receive income from medicaid, or if we must continue to seek income through donations and/or grants.</p>

<p>Midwifery care is a caring, more personalized approach to prenatal care and birth.  The ultimate goal is the same: healthy mom and healthy baby.  However, the path to that goal is very different.  Midwives encourage women to be empowered by the changes happening in their bodies, and educate them fully about those changes.  Natural remedies are sought out when normal pregnancy ailments creep in.  In turn, mothers learn to naturally treat their own families, and thus a circle of good health begins from the seeds planted in midwifery care.</p>

<p></p>
<p>My school will be the children’s school. It will have a natural open ended aesthetic led by the curiosity and creativity of the children themselves.  There will be imaginative play, process based real art, community building, and lots of music making and storytelling.  All the scarves and parachute and dancing ribbons, treasure hunts, simple yoga, Spanish, Sign Language, and stone soup will be there.  It will be their own magical space where minds open up to all the possibilities and the children themselves will own their new found discoveries.  I envision a jug band concert.  I see nature as a central teacher.  I believe compassion should be a core curriculum.  Mindfulness is a state of learning. </p>

</div><div> <p>Since my departure from the library, I have been overwhelmed by the love and  support of so many of my friends, co-workers, and most especially, the parents of my story time children.  Many have insisted on helping more.  Many have suggested that I open a preschool.  Secretly, it has been a dream in the back of my head, and at the front of my heart, for many years.  I have felt that one hour a week was just not enough to sufficiently impact those precious beautiful children.  So, here I am, answering my life's actual calling - to open Singing Tree Preschool.  I do, though need some help.  I need start up funds.  These will cover initial rent, deposits, insurance, licensing, marketing material, and signage.  I figure $5,000 for all that.  Next the school will need furniture, cabinetry, manipulative/play stations, activity tables, books, instruments, and a play structure.  Natural materials and open ended items are crucial.  I envision a farmers market station inside with actual flower/vegetable beds outside.  I would love to have a little playhouse where lots of imagination can flourish.   </p>
<p>So what do you get for all of this generosity.  Well, for starters you get my undying gratitude just for visiting this page.  For pledges, there is the customary thank you card, a free digital copy of The Singing Tree picture book shown on the intro video, original whimsical illustration art prints by Mirandy's sister Arrolynn (8x10), and art prints of my husband's photography (approximately 11x17 or 17x25 depending on donation amount).  Please check out our gallery specifically set up for this occasion by hitting the ""gallery"" link at the top of this page. (When you choose perks that include an illustration or photo print make sure you email us with your image selection.)  For a $500 donation all of these items will be included plus a commemorative plaque proudly displayed at the school.  An extremely generous $1,000 donation will include everything plus a plaque and an additional living ""singing"" tree in honor of the kindness.  This tree will hopefully be on the school grounds, but circumstances may require it to be relocated to another public space in town.  It will of course include its own plaque with a poetic statement of gratitude honoring the generous donor.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Donations are of course not the only way to help.  Spread the word.  Let the cat out the bag.  Run through the streets like Paul Revere.  Word of mouth is a wonderful way to share.  There is one fairly big item I am currently in search of - a warm, inviting, central school location!  A little house with a great room and a nice fenced in yard would be perfect.  The owners would have to agree to allow a preschool on the premises.  If anyone could find a welcoming host, that would be amazing.  </p>

<p>My name is Ynanna Djehuty. I am an Afro-Dominican woman born and raised in the Bronx. I am a writer and certified birth doula. In October 2009, I published my book, <strong>‘Hija De Mi Madre’</strong> (My Mother’s Daughter), which is a combination of memoirs, poems and research material that describes the effects of race on identity. I am currently working on the next part of my journey – one of deep healing and transcendence. As I work on the forthcoming book, <strong>Mujer Negra: Evolution</strong>, I am sharing my ideas about transcendence and breaking cycles with larger audiences. I have been invited by the <strong>National Association of Hispanic and Latino Studies</strong> to present two abstracts at the upcoming conference in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am in need of assistance to reach the conference.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need $2000 to be able to get to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This money will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference registration fee</li>
<li>Roundtrip flight from Syracuse to Baton Rouge</li>
<li>Lodging for 3 nights</li>
<li>Submissions to the national organization’s Monograph Series and the Journal of Intercultural Disciplines</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Perks! For your help, I have a short list of perks that I will gladly gift you for your own special gift to me:
<ul>
<li>$10  – Two exclusive poetry tracks by yours truly that have not been released to the public</li>
<li>$50– A signed copy of my first book, Hija De Mi Madre</li>
<li>$100– A signed copy of “The Abyss Stares Back,” a limited edition collection of essays that my forthcoming book are based on</li>
<li>$500 – All of the above + a long distance Reiki healing session</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All of the funds raised will go towards getting to the conference.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Giving a voice to an underrepresented group of women, Afro-Latinas, is crucial to their healing. In the last 3 years, the power of my personal narrative has touched many audiences and has planted seeds that I have had the honor of nurturing. My presence at conferences such as this one gives me the opportunity to make connections with more colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning. Reaching this particular demographic of students is important due to the influential nature of an undergraduate career on the life of an individual. The following is a short list of the impact I have had on the people I have shared my story and research with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encouraging college students to explore their Afro-Latino heritage</li>
<li>Sparked many discussions on the effects of losing touch with your self</li>
<li>Mentorship to two women on their own path of healing</li>
<li>Inspired some who have read my book to cut their processed hair and embrace their natural hair</li>

My name is Ynanna Djehuty. I am an Afro-Dominican woman born and raised in the Bronx. I am a writer and certified birth doula. In October 2009, I published my book, ‘Hija De Mi Madre’ (My Mother’s Daughter), which is a combination of memoirs, poems and research material that describes the effects of race on identity. I am currently working on the next part of my journey – one of deep healing and transcendence. As I work on the forthcoming book, Mujer Negra: Evolution, I am sharing my ideas about transcendence and breaking cycles with larger audiences. I have been invited by the National Association of Hispanic and Latino Studies to present two abstracts at the upcoming conference in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am in need of assistance to reach the conference.
What I Need & What You Get
I need $2000 to be able to get to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. This money will go to:

Conference registration fee
Roundtrip flight from Syracuse to Baton Rouge
Lodging for 3 nights
Submissions to the national organization’s Monograph Series and the Journal of Intercultural Disciplines

Perks! For your help, I have a short list of perks that I will gladly gift you for your own special gift to me:

$10  – Two exclusive poetry tracks by yours truly that have not been released to the public
$50– A signed copy of my first book, Hija De Mi Madre
$100– A signed copy of “The Abyss Stares Back,” a limited edition collection of essays that my forthcoming book are based on
$500 – All of the above + a long distance Reiki healing session


All of the funds raised will go towards getting to the conference.
The Impact
Giving a voice to an underrepresented group of women, Afro-Latinas, is crucial to their healing. In the last 3 years, the power of my personal narrative has touched many audiences and has planted seeds that I have had the honor of nurturing. My presence at conferences such as this one gives me the opportunity to make connections with more colleges, universities and institutions of higher learning. Reaching this particular demographic of students is important due to the influential nature of an undergraduate career on the life of an individual. The following is a short list of the impact I have had on the people I have shared my story and research with:

Encouraging college students to explore their Afro-Latino heritage
Sparked many discussions on the effects of losing touch with your self
Mentorship to two women on their own path of healing
Inspired some who have read my book to cut their processed hair and embrace their natural hair
A following of over 1,000 people who seek inspiration from my social media sites daily
Hija De Mi Madre was added to a high school reading list. A graduate of that school got in touch with me to share how much my story has inspired her

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I recently went to Guatemala to my 20th High School reunion. While reconnecting with old friends I found out about one of my classmates, Cinthya Vallejo. She was an attorney in Guatemala, but her focus changed in 2004 after doing social work helping children that were being abused and abandoned. She wanted to open a home for these children were they could be taken care of and educated. Finally in 2010, she opened the home God Bless the Children. I decided I want to help her. She left her job as a lawyer and now dedicates her time to take care of 14 kids that she speaks of as they are her own.  I know she struggles sometimes to even pay the rent, and I hope I can help her help her kids. Her story touched me enough to try to do something for them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>At first I had the idea of raising funds to get the kids Christmas toys, but I know that diapers, food and shelter come first. She told me that she felt that God always provided for her, that she's been lucky to get donations when she needed them most. I am hoping you will help me, help these kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The children she takes care of come form different parts of the country and different situations, but at God Bless The Children they take care of them with love.  I only wish to help her keep taking care of them. I have never done a campaign like this, but I really believe that helping this cause we can make a real difference.</p>
<p>I will bring all the money I collect from this campaign when I go to Guatemala for Christmas. I will send an update with photos of the home when I visit and give her the donation.</p>

<p><span class=""notranslate"">My name is Keith Goddard and I have been a teacher in Toronto for almost 20 years.

Most of the 3,000+ books in this shipment have been donated from three Toronto area schools and private citizens of Toronto. Most of those people I found through ads on Kijiji or Craig's List. Besides Bright Future School, I will also be donating 500 of the books (that are at a high school level) to a high school in that neighbourhood in Keta, where many of the Bright Future School graduates go to. It would be tragic if, when they went off to high school, there were no books for them. I have many amazing high school level text books and fiction books. I also have about 500 university level books, and most of those I will be giving to a newly built university in the Volta Region (Volta University).

</div>Hello Friends, extended friends an family! I've just returned from India  where Tsering Gellek and I ran a Business Beyond Self Interest conference.  Two members of our diverse group of business people, educators, social activists and monks, were Charlotte Leech and Sanat Kumar two wonderful people and are working to bring education and self-sufficiency to a portion of rural India.  The attached video was produced in 2008. Their school opened in 2014 and they are now are looking for support for 30 students. The cost of materials, etc. for a year for one child is only about $400.  Since we are contributing directly to the school, a small contribution can actually change a life!  I'm supporting one student and extending the opportunity to share in this happiness to others.  My hope is to raise an additional $1,500 to support 3 more children, though small and large contributions. With the power of a group, even a $5.00 contributions helps! <div>

The children whom Loka educates -currently in the form of extra classes in the afternoon- are educationally disadvantaged due to lack of good schools in the region. Loka’s aim is to help improve this situation the soonest and we kindly ask your support in doing so! Sponsoring a child costs about $400 per year and includes all study materials.  And why not make this Christmas extra special by investing in a small-scale and local project that provides value education, empowers women and believes in sustainable growth and a green world….<p></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our current ""science lab"" is a converted elementary school classroom with a small sink in the back. With no real facilities, the girls are only able to perform the most rudimentary ""kitchen science"". In order for our girls to remain competitive in the important areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, they need to supplement their classroom instruction with practical hands on experiments. This requires an overhaul of the laboratory room to include plumbed gas, air, and vacuum, as well as lab benches with functional sinks. To enable chemistry work, we would also need proper safety equipment including chemical cabinets, an emergency shower with drainage, and several eye wash stations.</p>
<p>In addition to facilities improvements, we also need all of the requisite lab equipment: incubators and centriguges, Bunsen burners, microscopes and dissection kits, beakers and graduated cylinders. For chemistry, we need a proper stockroom of chemicals and physics instruction requires ramps, pulleys, motion sensors, timers, and many other items for measuring mass, velocity, or distance. Without these tools of the trade, our girls will struggle to compete in the ever increasing competitive market of college acceptance in the sciences.</p>
<p>Currently, school tuition covers roughly 80% of daily operational costs The remainder is raised through a dedicated group of parents running fundraisers throughout the year, but these efforts cannot accomodate large project plans like this.</p>
<p>This is where all of you come in. If you believe in education, and specifically in providing a solid foundation for young women to develop in the areas of science and engineering, please contribute to our campaign. If you are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help by spreading the word. Link to our campaign on your Facebook page, send a Tweet, or mention us on your blog. Point all of your friends and family and neighbors to our campaign. Each new set of eyes that see our story will help get us closer to our goal. </p>
<p>Finally, since we are a recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization, your contribution will be tax deductible. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many studies show a continued bias against women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers which begins in the junior high and high school years. Nazareth Academy's single sex education model already removes many of the inherent biases found in co-educational institutions, and can overcome most of the other hurdles by providing a strong introduction and foundation for our girls in these important areas.</p>
<p>Your gift will help us realize this goal, and increase the potential for young women to explore and excel in STEM careers. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to build our science and technology center, and stock it with all of the necessary equipment and supplies. We also have many achievable smaller goals, where your contribution will be put to good use as well. Even if we do not make our $100,000 goal, any amount raised can be used for chemicals and small equipment, or to add more sinks and cabinets to our science lab. Each dollar can be utilized in an important way to maximize our ability to educate these young women.</p>
<p>We would like for our message to reach a million people, and you can help us get there. Even if you are unable to contribute at this time, help us spread the word. </p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">We are writing to let you know about an exciting opportunity we have to be a part of the James127 project which helps the women and children of Tobati, Paraguay. The James127 project is based on James 1:27, ""What God considers to be pure and genuine religion is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering...""   The women and children of Tobati definitely fall into this category.  There is very little work available in Paraguay and the men of the area usually go to Argentina to find work to support their families  and soon after abandon them for another woman there.  In many cases the mothers of these families also then go to Argentina to find work and are unable or unwilling to return to the children they left behind.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The intent of the James127 project is to support the families of Tobati emotionally, physically and spiritually. We will be building an education center, constructing a donated playground, delivering over 500 donated wheelchairs, creating/delivering art for the education center, and connecting local families with churches for followup support. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span></h3></div>","Dear Friends and Family,
We are writing to let you know about an exciting opportunity we have to be a part of the James127 project which helps the women and children of Tobati, Paraguay. The James127 project is based on James 1:27, ""What God considers to be pure and genuine religion is this: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering...""   The women and children of Tobati definitely fall into this category.  There is very little work available in Paraguay and the men of the area usually go to Argentina to find work to support their families  and soon after abandon them for another woman there.  In many cases the mothers of these families also then go to Argentina to find work and are unable or unwilling to return to the children they left behind.
The intent of the James127 project is to support the families of Tobati emotionally, physically and spiritually. We will be building an education center, constructing a donated playground, delivering over 500 donated wheelchairs, creating/delivering art for the education center, and connecting local families with churches for followup support. 
(Please see our video for more details)
We would like to give you the opportunity to be a part of this project with us!
How you can help:
1. Thoughts and prayers as we prepare for, and participate in this trip.
2. Financial support - The cost of our trip (total for both of us) is $5900 and includes transportation, hotel, travel insurance, meals, transfers, construction materials, and follow-up funding. (50% of our funds must be turned into James127 by May 1st and the other 50% by June 15th)  
For those of you who feel like you would like to partner with us financially you can contribute via this secure website.  If you would like to support us through a check you would need to make it out to Su Refugio Ministries and contact us for our address. 
We want to thank you in advance for all your support and promise to keep you updated through Facebook and/or email along with this website.
Sharing the love of God with those who may feel unloved or abandoned,

<h3>Dear Friends of Youth Rugby,</h3>
<p>     We are Rugby NY, the governing body for youth rugby in the state of New York. We are a 501c Non-profit organisztion.  We fall under the direction of USA Rugby.  As you can see from the logo above, we have created Project 2020 with the goal of putting a boy or a girl from NY on the 2020 USA Olympic Rugby team.  We are confident that we can achive this goal, but we believe that the future olympian has yet to pick up a rugby ball.  In order to achive this very lofty goal, we must introduce rugby to as many kids in NY as we can.  We have 3 areas on which we focus: </p>
<p>1. PE Classes</p>
<p>2. Youth programs, such as, YMCA or Boys and Girls Clubs.</p>
<p>3. High School Rugby teams</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    Our goal is simple- we would would like to supply every Gym class, every YMCA, and every HS team with free equipment.  School and Program budgets are at an all time low.  We do not want to give sport directors a finacial excuse for saying no to rugby.  Rugby already has an negitive reputation, so we don't want finances to be the, proverbial ""nail in the coffin."" </p>
<p>  We would like to rasise $15,000, with which we will purchase 2 years worth of equipment for NY youth rugby. </p>
<p>    For corporate donations you have the opportunity to have your logo seen by hundreds of thousands of potentional customers. </p>
<p>   We thank you in advance for helping us reach our goal.  Remember that it ""takes a village"" to send a child to the Olympics!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

What We Need & How It Will Help:

We need your help now to get the ball rolling!
Filing fees, domain names and hosting costs are estimated to be at $1000. A friend is willing to help design the website, but also informed me that the scope and complexity of my idea will pretty quickly require a design and programming team. Also I would like to put a more detailed explanation and include some psychological and anthropological insights into a self published book and put the profits back into the company.
I am hoping that with $3500 I can incorporate and apply for tax exemption status, begin website development and self-publish a book. Any contributions I receive will be put toward advancing this project. If I do not reach my funding goal, I will simply use whatever funds I do have to make as much progress as possible, and work towards other methods of funding.
I am so excited to discover this community and want to thank everyone for their involvement with this website, IndieGoGo is inspirational in its existence alone, and reaffirms the hope that my project will also succeed.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is James, I'm a student/writer/musician/bike mechanic/dishwasher and some time ago I realized that what I really really want is to intern at the Rachel Maddow Show, because they tell stories the way that I want to tell stories, and are also badass but still somehow mainstream, and also accessible but still critical, and I want to be a part of it all. </p>
<p>So I collected a resume and letters of recommendation, and made the above video and holy of holies, it worked. They hired me. I start at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The internship pays, but not very much, and New York is expensive. On top of that, until about a week ago my bugdet included student loans, but those fell through. So here I am!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">This is where you come in.</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All told, this adventure is going to cost something like $10,000. But with the pay, and some surprise generous donations from my amazing and by no means well-off family, I have all but $2,500.</p>
<p>This is what you're helping fund if you contribute: </p>
<p>-$450 Plane ticket. This is total round-trip. It's also a score. I'm lucky to have found it.</p>
<p>-$3,800 Rent in New York and partial rent in Vancouver: My partner and I share a one-bedroom, and though he's offered to pay more rent while I'm gone, I dont want him to suffer so I can follow my dreams. If I make more than my goal, this is where the money will go.</p>
<p>-$480 monthly transit passes in New York. So practical!</p>
<p>-$120-200 NY phone. The show communicates a lot via phone and text messages. I'm looking for the cheapest plan, so this is an estimate.</p>
<p>-$500 Passport, replacement IDs and related paperwork fees. I thought my Canadian passport and SS number would be sufficient. It wasn't. I had to get a lot of things expidited.</p>
<p>-$400 Work clothes and shoes. <em>You mean these ripped shorts and tank-tops I've been fixing bikes and washing dishes in aren't enough?</em></p>
<p>-$4,000 Spending money, ($250/week). Food, entertainment, visiting my mom in Maine over a weekend, buying Rachel Maddow a drink, everything else.

<p>This internship an amazing opportunity for me. It's the biggest thing I've ever asked for and the biggest thing I've ever gotten. If I can focus my energy on working as hard as possible, instead of on counting my pennies, the amount I'll be able to acheive will increase ten-fold. </p>

<h3>Here's What You're Contributing To</h3>
<p>I'm a recovered anorexic, bulimic, and binge eater. I'm also a certified health coach. <strong>My dream is to create a revolutionary coaching practice that seeks to heal the heart of emotional eating and body image issues.</strong></p>
<p>Using a method called The Option Process<sup>®</sup>, <strong>I will be able to effectively coach young women in exploring what created their unhealthy relationship with food. low self-esteem, and negative body image.</strong> This process was a godsend for me, personally, in clearing up remaining attachments that led to my believing that I wasn't good enough, which resulted in my eating disorder.</p>
<p>I have seen the effects that this work has on people with eating disorders. <strong>I have met and spoken with at least a dozen people in the last few months who  have used The Option Process to heal their own food issues</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>I am looking to fundraise $1,500 to take <em>Power</em>Dialogues</strong>, which will will help me to gain better understanding of the role of a Mentor in the Option Process Dialogue.</p>
<p>I have volunteered for The Option Institute to get a $500 credit towards the program, and am in need of funding for the rest.</p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you're changing someone's life. Body image issues impact a person's relationships, career, and confidence. <strong>Help someone get the help they need by donating any amount that's possible for you.</strong> Your help is so greatly appreciated that words could not even begin to describe the gratitude I have for your actions.</p>
<p>In addition to the warm, fuzzy feeling you'll get from creating a loving, happy, and healthy future for young girls everywhere, you'll also receive:</p>

</ul><div><em><strong>YOU, my dear reader, are AMAZING and freaking AWESOME. THANK YOU for reading this, contributing, and sharing your light with the world. YOU ARE LOVED AND APPRECIATED!!!</strong></em></div></div>","Here's What You're Contributing To
I'm a recovered anorexic, bulimic, and binge eater. I'm also a certified health coach. My dream is to create a revolutionary coaching practice that seeks to heal the heart of emotional eating and body image issues.
Using a method called The Option Process®, I will be able to effectively coach young women in exploring what created their unhealthy relationship with food. low self-esteem, and negative body image. This process was a godsend for me, personally, in clearing up remaining attachments that led to my believing that I wasn't good enough, which resulted in my eating disorder.
I have seen the effects that this work has on people with eating disorders. I have met and spoken with at least a dozen people in the last few months who  have used The Option Process to heal their own food issues.


What I Need & What You Get
I am looking to fundraise $1,500 to take PowerDialogues, which will will help me to gain better understanding of the role of a Mentor in the Option Process Dialogue.
I have volunteered for The Option Institute to get a $500 credit towards the program, and am in need of funding for the rest.
When you contribute to this campaign, you're changing someone's life. Body image issues impact a person's relationships, career, and confidence. Help someone get the help they need by donating any amount that's possible for you. Your help is so greatly appreciated that words could not even begin to describe the gratitude I have for your actions.
In addition to the warm, fuzzy feeling you'll get from creating a loving, happy, and healthy future for young girls everywhere, you'll also receive:


A handwritten thank you card from Shannon when you donate $10
A handwritten thank you card and video from Shannon when you donate $25

A 50-minute Dialogue with Shannon when you donate $50

<p>I'm Ilya, Kick Director at Spring, a purpose driven activator in Vancouver.</p>
<p>We support entrepreneurs who are working at the intersection of technology and impact. </p>
<p>Our incubator program, Kick, has helped over 60 entrepreneurs launch and scale their businesses, some of which are now valued in the millions of dollars.</p>
<p>We got introduced to student entrepreneurs in the <b>Parque Tecnologico Sartenejas in Caracas Venezuela</b>. They are working on 4 different startups and are in need of some top notch mentorship from an international source. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Venezuela government has restricted the amount of foreign currency a Venezuelan can spend to <i>only $300 a year online. </i></p>
<p>However, these entrepreneurs suggested offering up their <b>technology and design talent </b>to help crowdfund their tuition and allow you to benefit from their skills.</p>

Hola! 
I'm Ilya, Kick Director at Spring, a purpose driven activator in Vancouver.
We support entrepreneurs who are working at the intersection of technology and impact. 
Our incubator program, Kick, has helped over 60 entrepreneurs launch and scale their businesses, some of which are now valued in the millions of dollars.
We got introduced to student entrepreneurs in the Parque Tecnologico Sartenejas in Caracas Venezuela. They are working on 4 different startups and are in need of some top notch mentorship from an international source. 
Unfortunately, the Venezuela government has restricted the amount of foreign currency a Venezuelan can spend to only $300 a year online. 
However, these entrepreneurs suggested offering up their technology and design talent to help crowdfund their tuition and allow you to benefit from their skills.

International Impact Arbitrage 
Let's be honest, things are not going well in Venezuela now and allowing these entrepreneurs to share their skills with you will be a great opportunity for them.
The tech sector is one of the only bright lights of the Venezuelan Economy and their young people. 
Here are the people and project you'll be able to impact and what they can do for you: 
INpetus: On demand platform to match startups with services. 
Team: David Goudet, Andrea Díaz, Gabriel Freitas, Denisse González.
Gamekip: Software to Gamification for workplace motivation
Team: Leo Ramos, Alejando Ballesta. 
Una Raya Más: AirBnB for Tatoos
Team: Daniel Marín, Andrés Guerrero, Héctor Goncalves.
Pago en Red:  Digital Parking lot payments 
Team: Jesús Peñaloza, Esteban Struve.    Tap into an international talent pool & help develop an emerging market. By supporting these entrepreneurs, you'll be able to get:   A friend in Venezuela for life.
An insider tour of the Caracas startup scene. Super deals on logos, landing pages and MVP's.
Translation of your website into Spanish 
Custom tech work and a new market of opportunities. 
 

NOTE: All the technical work will be done by the team at Una Raya Mas. You can see a sample of their work here. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 No worries if you can't chip in financially. You can still help by:   Spreading the word  on Social Networks

<p>Hi! My name is Yasunori Numakoshi. I'm a book producer in Japan. I have worked in publishing for many years and really enjoy creating fun ways for people to learn English conversation. One of the books I produced in rencet years was ranked #3 in the <a href=""http://amazon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">amazon.com</a> English conversation section.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This winter we'd like to produce an English pronunciation book in one of my favorite American Cities, Seattle. To make this the most unique and engaging book for the Japanese audience we are working with beautiful and intelegent American women to teach everyday English conversation. It may sound common place in the States, but in Japan everyone loves to hear smart, beautiful American women speak. Both men and women are very interested to learn about they way American women speak and the body langauge they use in daily conversation. For years too the books have been dry, overly academic, and not aknowledged the use of the face, body, and vocal tone in English communication. This also makes for a much more entertaining experience for the students! We aim to entertain! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p>In Japan, English is not seen as entertainment; people only think of it as education. This is one reason most Japanese can’t speak English. It’s not fun and they give up learning it. So we'd like to make English more fun, natural, and easy to get into. Our previous book project got ranked #3 on Amazon's ""English conversation"" section. That book was a series of real interviews with Americans - natural, unscripted, and quite funny! With this book we saw the Japanese perceptions of English studying begin to change, but we can do more!</p>
<p>The Japanese people have come to realize how important pronunciation is speaking fluidly. Correctly pronouncing English is tough but rewarding for Japanese people. Knowing how to correctly say the words you have studied enables you to communicate with people all over the globe. We have heard countless stories of Japanese people who could not communicate well with Westerners in English, despite considerable study in English, due mainly to their inability to pronounce and hear words. We think this is because pronunciation is seen as a chore. Through working with amazing American women we can get people interested in pronunciation and assist students in becoming better all around converationalists. We really want to make this a fun and rewarding experience. We know that both men and women will enjoy this product, and help them have fun as they study!</p>
<p>Our book sold at the book stores all over the Japan, as well as major internet retailers. We will also send our book to rouhgly 100 Japanese media sources including major magazines and TV companies. All we need in the means to make the content. That is why we are coming to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong> </p>
<p>Producing a book and DVD is not cheap! We have to work with a lot of professionals, such as a cameraman, photographer, sound tech, casting agency, coordinators, and models. We also need to rent the camera, sound equipment, and other expensive tools! Our team typically produces these books with a combination of our own funds and help from the publisher. Sadly, Japanese publishers do not see the need for students to learn from an actual American person. We want to prove to them that seeing and hearing Americans will help students get better. It is also a great way to get Japanese people to become comfortable with hearing Americans talk. So this time we want to partner with you!</p>
<p>Here’s what we need:</p>
<p>space rental</p>
<p>camera rental</p>
<p>light rental</p>
<p>sound rental</p>
<p>casting (cameraman,photographer, professor, sound tech, light tech, models etc)</p>
<p>editing</p>
<p>sound effects</p>
<p>promotion &amp; marketing</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For your support, your name can be included in the book. You</p>
<p>can have a title (such as “”Adviser"" or Executive Producer""), and</p>
<p>you could even show up on the DVD. All of this can be used</p>
<p>to further your career and can be added to your resume.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we're looking forward to your help!</p></div>","Synopsis

<h2>Our students are going to change the world.</h2>
<h2>But we won't be able to open our doors without your help. </h2>
<p>As a free public school, we don't receive our state funding until November, so this fundraiser will create the bridge to allow us to open our doors and operate until then. </p>
<p>Read below for more information about how crucial your contribution is to our school and to learn more about the incredible amount of good that we can ONLY do with your help.</p>
<h3><span>Why we need your help:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Detroit Achievement Academy is a free public school and is therefore funded by the great State of Michigan. </span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>The State doesn't send us our first (small) piece of funding until November.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>But our first day of school is in September.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>It costs a bunch of money to start and run a great school until November!</span></li>
</ul><h3><span><br/>What we will use the money to do:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><span>STAFF. </span></strong><span>We will pay our teachers, administrators, and classroom assistants.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span>FACILITIES. </span></strong><span>We will pay our rent and utilities bills.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span>CLASSROOM MATERIALS. </span></strong><span>We will buy desks, pencils, and joyful, print-rich learning aids to hang in our classrooms.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span><br/>Pretty simple, right? We will certainly have plenty of other startup costs, but we have used our business and negotiating chops to structure them to fall after we begin receiving state funding or when we are likely to receive various other grants. <strong>Essentially, we are only asking for what we absolutely need in order to be able to open our doors to our students this fall</strong>.</span></p>
<h3>
<br/>Here are the basics about Detroit Achievement Academy: </h3>
<ul>
<li>We are starting with 50 Kindergarten students and 50 1st grade students. We'll add a grade level each year; our students move up and we will take new classes of Kindergarten.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We will be located on the northwest side of Detroit, in the Grandmont-Rosedale neighborhood.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We have all approvals and authorizations to operate as a school.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Our authorizer is Grand Valley State University. They are <a href=""https://secure.gvsu.edu/gvnow/index.htm?articleId=E5A293DB-F4AA-BB00-C9E9FD41EECEA0C3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nationally respected</a> for the success of their schools. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">But we aren't starting a school to do things<br/>the way that they are currently being done. </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<br/>Here is how we are different: </h3>
<ul>
<li>Our Principal, Sharon Yaecker Roesser, is seriously incredible. She has <span>12 years experience in education as a teacher, a social worker, and school leader in schools in New York City and Detroit</span>. Essentially, her life's work has been removing obstacles for students and families as they move along their paths toward their own hopes and dreams.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Our curriculum, <a href=""http://elschools.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Expeditionary Learning</a>, is project-based, with learning standards focused on the Common Core. Schools that use Expeditionary Learning outperform other schools in their district by 12%. A study done in NYC found that <span class=""il"">EL</span> schools ""closed the gap"" in English Language Arts for African-American, Hispanic, and low-income students and English language learners.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>We will feed our students three balanced meals a day. We believe that our students should know what they are eating, from where it came, and how and by whom it was grown. DAA will use food as a tool to teach everything from geography to social studies to math.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>We will have a full-time Director of Family &amp; Student Support, who will coordinate services and assistance to our familes, facilitate community meetings, and generally serve as an advocate for our families and neighborhood.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>We will have heavy amounts of community programming. It is a top priority for us to be a part of the fabric of our neighborhood and community.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>We will foster our visual and performing arts program and use it to enrich our school culture and our daily classroom activities. </span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li><span>We believe our students deserve to learn from experts. Every Wednesday at 1:30pm, our students will be released from their classes to a Master Class. During this time, our classroom teachers will meet, plan, and collaborate. Our students will then receive a lesson and complete projects with experts from a wide range of industries. Our Master Classes will include everything from a introduction to code and programming to Aztec dance to saving seeds from vegetables. We believe that exposing our students to both cutting edge and traditional practices and ideas will empower them as they create their own path, with their own interests and talents. </span></li>
</ul><h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><br/>What you get for helping us out:</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">We want to show you how much we appreciate your help, so we developed some fun perks for our donors! </span></p>

Read below for more information about how crucial your contribution is to our school and to learn more about the incredible amount of good that we can ONLY do with your help.
Why we need your help:

Detroit Achievement Academy is a free public school and is therefore funded by the great State of Michigan. 

The State doesn't send us our first (small) piece of funding until November.

But our first day of school is in September.

It costs a bunch of money to start and run a great school until November!
What we will use the money to do:


STAFF. We will pay our teachers, administrators, and classroom assistants.


FACILITIES. We will pay our rent and utilities bills.


CLASSROOM MATERIALS. We will buy desks, pencils, and joyful, print-rich learning aids to hang in our classrooms.

Pretty simple, right? We will certainly have plenty of other startup costs, but we have used our business and negotiating chops to structure them to fall after we begin receiving state funding or when we are likely to receive various other grants. Essentially, we are only asking for what we absolutely need in order to be able to open our doors to our students this fall.

Here are the basics about Detroit Achievement Academy: 

We are starting with 50 Kindergarten students and 50 1st grade students. We'll add a grade level each year; our students move up and we will take new classes of Kindergarten.

We will be located on the northwest side of Detroit, in the Grandmont-Rosedale neighborhood.

We have all approvals and authorizations to operate as a school.

Our authorizer is Grand Valley State University. They are nationally respected for the success of their schools. 
 
But we aren't starting a school to do thingsthe way that they are currently being done. 
 

Here is how we are different: 

Our Principal, Sharon Yaecker Roesser, is seriously incredible. She has 12 years experience in education as a teacher, a social worker, and school leader in schools in New York City and Detroit. Essentially, her life's work has been removing obstacles for students and families as they move along their paths toward their own hopes and dreams.

Our curriculum, Expeditionary Learning, is project-based, with learning standards focused on the Common Core. Schools that use Expeditionary Learning outperform other schools in their district by 12%. A study done in NYC found that EL schools ""closed the gap"" in English Language Arts for African-American, Hispanic, and low-income students and English language learners.

We will feed our students three balanced meals a day. We believe that our students should know what they are eating, from where it came, and how and by whom it was grown. DAA will use food as a tool to teach everything from geography to social studies to math.

We will have a full-time Director of Family & Student Support, who will coordinate services and assistance to our familes, facilitate community meetings, and generally serve as an advocate for our families and neighborhood.

We will have heavy amounts of community programming. It is a top priority for us to be a part of the fabric of our neighborhood and community.

We will foster our visual and performing arts program and use it to enrich our school culture and our daily classroom activities. 

We believe our students deserve to learn from experts. Every Wednesday at 1:30pm, our students will be released from their classes to a Master Class. During this time, our classroom teachers will meet, plan, and collaborate. Our students will then receive a lesson and complete projects with experts from a wide range of industries. Our Master Classes will include everything from a introduction to code and programming to Aztec dance to saving seeds from vegetables. We believe that exposing our students to both cutting edge and traditional practices and ideas will empower them as they create their own path, with their own interests and talents. 
What you get for helping us out:
We want to show you how much we appreciate your help, so we developed some fun perks for our donors! 
Like our Thank You Art. The balloons will be fingerprints from the first day of school.

And our Seed Packet. These seeds will be the same seeds we use in our classrooms, in our gardens, to send home to families, etc. They will come from the various seed cooperatives in Detroit and other southeast Michigan farmers.
 
And of course, our DAA T-shirt. These will be what our students wear (though often with long sleeves) and our friends have been asking for them since they saw the smaller versions. We would love to see them on our donors!
 
And, our most coveted piece of DAA gear, the DAA Sweatshirts. These are soft, cozy, and will be exclusive to our Indiegogo backers. That's right, these are awesome AND limited edition.
       
 
We can't wait to have you all involved with Detroit Achievement Academy!  Check out ALL the ways you can help on the right!
We can't wait to send you your thank you gifts. 
Thank you for helping us open our school!

<h2><strong>What's this Trip All About?</strong></h2>
<p>The trip focuses on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We will be meeting with experts in DC and NYC as well as throughout Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan. The trip is organized and facilitated by the Olive Tree Initiative, which aims to give students exposure to every dimension of international conflict through first-hand experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>The delegation will be composed of about 20 undergraduates from UC Berkeley and Stanford as well as several graduate students from San Diego State University.</li>
<li>The trip will take place from July 28th to August 18th. </li>
<li>We will spend several days on the east coast meeting with American experts and officials before departing to the Middle East.</li>
<li>Once we arrive in the Middle East, we will be crossing borders every few days, traveling throughout the region to meet with local leaders and touring sites relevant to the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  </li>
<li>Last summer, OTI students met with representatives from the White House, U.S. Department of State, various congressional offices, the United Nations, Human Rights Watch, World Economic Forum, Israeli Knesset, Palestinian Legislative Council, the Jordanian royal family, and many other prominent organizations. </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Why I <em>NEED</em> your help:</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I can't do this without you. International travel is expensive, and while I will be paying for much of the cost, I won't be able to go without the support of friends and family. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity that I won't be able to take without your help. All funds donated will go toward travel expenses (airfare, hotels, buses, etc.)</p>
<h2><strong>Why does this opportunity matter?</strong></h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">As a student of political science and history, I've studied the history of the Middle East, European History, Conflict &amp; Religion, and Comparative Politics; I plan on pursuing a career in public service. However, in-class learning isn't enough to truly understand the realities of international politics. First hand exposure is the only way to understand the realities of this kind of conflict. This trip would be a life changing experience for me. </p>

</p><p>UPDATE: THE AMOUNT NEEDED FOR MY FEES HAS BEEN REACHED! I'm so, so grateful to everyone for this. After asking Twitter, I've decided to leave this campaign open: in all of the student finance awfulness, they also stripped me of a £3,000 maintenance grant that I should be using to support my family and my time in university - they assessed me as NEEDING it, then cut it away. I didn't think I'd have time or the reach to raise this money, but the campaign is being left open until its closing date in order for people who wish to donate and make the amount I'm missing out on a little smaller able to do so. I love you all so much. Thank you for being here.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>A few months ago, we raised almost £3k through a previous campaign. Although
it wasn't anywhere near the full amount I needed, it was a really good start to
paying my fees. I started university and the £9000 for the
fees is due in April. Due to a magnificent show of generosity by a close
friend, the amount went up by £5,000. That means that there is £1,500 left to
pay on my fees, and I need it in the next two-three weeks. The amount aiming to be raised here reflects the charges IndieGoGo take from the amount raised, plus the £1500 required. If you know me and
my situation, that’s all you need to know. If you don’t, have a read below.
This is mostly the information posted on the original fundraiser, with some
small changes to reflect changes in my life.</p>
<p>I really believe we can raise this money. Every donation honestly does help, and a significant amount of the money
we raised last time came from small donations, so if you can spare £5, or £1,
please don't think it's not worth giving.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>Hi. I'm Dorian. I assume you know who I am, but
if by some miracle this reaches further: I am 24 years old. I live with my wife
and our 2yo son.<br/>
<br/>
I started university when I was 19, and I had a nervous breakdown 3 months in.
I failed university, ran out of money, and found out I was pregnant. I assumed
I'd never be able to go back.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I went out on a limb and applied to do the course I've wanted to do
since a child, Archaeology at Manchester. I got an unconditional offer. I dared
to dream of a way to support my family, despite being severely disabled, and
then Student Finance dashed those dreams again.<br/>
<br/>
I now have an unholy number of diagnoses. I have Major Depressive Disorder,
Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Ehlers-Danlos
Syndrome, Hypermobility, Chronic Fatigue, and a series of gastrointestinal
problems caused by these other conditions and the medications I take for them.
I am a wheelchair user and can't walk more than 50 metres. Because of how
disabled I am, my wife is my full-time carer. She cannot work, and as such we
live off a variety of state benefits designed to support families in our
position. We have nothing left over at the end of the month – the safety net of
the benefit state is hanging precariously low to the ground. In December, the
government decided that I had too much money, and cut our income support. I’m
now supporting all three of us on my meagre student loan. We cannot find spare
money.<br/>
<br/>
Student Finance have decided not to award me a tuition fee loan for this year.
I have two years of funding remaining with them, but they are only willing to
fund years 2 and 3 of my course. Their basis for this is the (incredibly disablist)
assumption that I may, again, be thwarted by disability and then they'd have
spent more money on me. I have appealed their decision, again and again, but
they refuse to listen.<br/>
<br/>
They have also assessed me as needing a £3,000 maintenance grant, but have
since stripped me of it and sent me a bill for £800 to make up for my
maintenance grant from the year I was 19. This is not money I have, and
makes going to university and supporting my family incredibly difficult.<br/>
<br/>
One of the ways to gain funding back is to prove that my previous failure was
the result of ill health. Unfortunately, thanks to the horrible GP that I had
at the time, my records are missing. I spent an hour going through them with my
current GP. I sent them every piece of evidence I had, and they've declared it
inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
I was supposed to be starting University, with appropriate support for the first
time in September. Instead I have had to scrape through on the bottom of my savings, with regular long panics about how it will all come to nothing if I cannot raise this obscene amount of money. I am so scared that I will lose any chance of this
opportunity thanks to bureaucracy and disablism. My health is plummeting with
the worry of it all. Everything hinges on this.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many stresses pressing down on us at the moment, that this is the
only way I can see forward. If everyone who follows me on Twitter were able to
chuck in 50p, then I'd be able to pay my fees for this year. I wouldn't
have to give up my dream. Even if they weren't, the more I'm able to get, the
more likely I might be to persuade charities or the university to make up the
rest.<br/>
<br/>
The target here represents a replacement of the money that Student Finance have
denied me for being disabled. If we can reach it, I can go to university. That
would, at the moment, be more than I could ever imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Any money raised in excess of this, tbh, is beyond my comprehension, but if the
unthinkable occurs, it will go towards paying for my specialist equipment, my
powerchair and our dire housing situation - especially in order to replace the grant that Student Finance cut.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for even reading this.</p>

<h3>What am I doing?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello there! My name is Breanna Berzins (if you don’t know me
and you are looking at this, then THANK YOU so much for taking the time to read and
hopefully partner alongside of me). I am a sophomore at a private Liberal Arts school called DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana. I
have recently declared my major in Kinesiology (the scientific study of human
movement), and am in the process of declaring a minor in Psychology. I was born
in Arizona and have lived there my whole life up until coming to Indiana for
school last fall (it’s been a rough weather adjustment). I decided to move to
the Midwest because I realized that the 4 years I spend getting my undergraduate
degree should be the years that I take advantage of the place I live,
especially if Arizona is a place I decide to live in again once I graduate. I
wanted to be able to experience living in a place I wasn’t familiar with and
put myself out there to the rest of the world that is outside of Arizona. Moving
to Indiana was definitely a culture (and weather) shock – but it was one of the
best decisions I have ever made.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Now that I have broadened my horizons in the U.S., I have been given an opportunity to
expand beyond that and broaden my horizons even more by moving to another
country – another hemisphere to be exact. I am starting this campaign for one
main reason: to help raise support for a study abroad trip to Australia or New
Zealand. DePauw offers an opportunity for students to pursue their educational
goals internationally by studying abroad. These off campus programs allow
DePauw students the chance to enhance their semester academic experiences
through engaging in independent study, service, and personal development
opportunities. I have found a few programs held in Australia and New Zealand
that would allow me to continue on with my Kinesiology and psychology studies
to help with the remaining credits I need. It has been my dream for years just to travel to the Southern Hemisphere, I can't imagine actually being able to live there for 5 months. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>If only money grew on trees...</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>I wish I had a surplus of money that I could spend on this
trip, but unfortunately, I do not. My piggy bank is pretty small and has
already been broken for DePauw tuition. <b>In
the end, I need to raise</b> <b>at least
$2,000. </b>This money will go directly to the study abroad program fee, room
and board, the plane ticket there and back, and
tuition. </p>
<p>Here is a more detailed breakdown (varies amongst the
different programs):</p>
<p>Program Fee: $2,500<br/></p>
<p>Room: $3,540 - $4,810</p>
<p>Board: $1,260 - $1,800</p>
<p>Airfare: $1,575 - $1,800</p>
<p>Tuition: ~ $7,500<br/></p>
<p>Adding all of that together, the cost is approximately $18,000
which is about $16,000 more than my desired goal. <b>Again, in the end, I need to raise at least $2,000.</b> (I have even included some incentives on the side of the page to help get you even more excited about donating!) Some of the remaining costs of the program I hope to get paid for by scholarships. But, I know my parents and even myself will be the major contributors<b> </b>for the remaining costs. For my own personal contribution, I am saving my money by working 10 hours a week at my school and also working over the summer at Paradise Bakery when I am back home. This is SO important to me and I know I will never get a chance to do something as remarkable as this ever again in my lifetime. I realize that I, too, will have to make sacrifices to make this happen and I am 100% dedicated to putting every penny I have earned towards this opportunity. My goal for the rest of this school year and for part of the summer that I will be home (I would leave for AU or NZ at the end of June) is to save as much money as possible to make this trip a reality. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The impact you can make<br/>
</h3>
<p>I know that $2,000 is not a small amount of money, and that is why I need your help. Your contributions will help make my dreams of beginning to travel the world a reality. I want to meet people that will change my life forever and have the opportunity to be immersed in new cultures. I am thrilled to experience new things and be given opportunities to love other people well. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Don't have the money?<br/>

The goal of an AMBER Alert is to instantly galvanize the entire community to assist in the search for and the safe recovery of the child</em>.  [HT - <a href=""http://www.amberalert.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amberalert.gov/</a>]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>
<p><em>To avoid both false alarms and having alerts ignored as a ""wolf cry"", the criteria for issuing an alert are rather strict. </em></p>
<p><em>The U.S. Department of Justice issues the following ""guidance"", which most states are said to ""adhere closely to"" (in the U.S.):[13] </em></p>
<p><em>     Law enforcement must confirm that an abduction has taken place.<br/>    The child must be at risk of serious injury or death.<br/>    There must be sufficient descriptive information of child, captor, <br/>        or captor's vehicle to issue an alert.<br/>    The child must be 17 years old or younger.</em></p>
<p><em>Many law enforcement agencies have not used #2 as a criterion, resulting in many parental abductions triggering an Amber Alert, where the child is not known or assumed to be at risk of serious injury or death.</em></p>
<p><em>According to the U.S. Department of Justice, of the children abducted by strangers and murdered, 75% are killed within the first three hours. Amber Alerts are designed to inform the general public quickly when a child has been kidnapped and is in danger so that ""the public [would be] additional eyes and ears of law enforcement"".[11] As of August 2002, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported that 17 children had been successfully recovered after an Amber alert was issued, including one case in which the abductor released the child after hearing the alert.</em></p>
<p><em>A Scripps Howard study of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in the United States in 2004 found that most issued alerts did not meet the Department of Justice's criteria. Fully 50% (117 alerts) were categorized by the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children as being ""family abductions"", very often a parent involved in a custody dispute. There were 48 alerts for children who had not been abducted at all, but were lost, ran away, involved in family misunderstandings (for example, two instances where the child was with grandparents), or as the result of hoaxes. Another 23 alerts were issued in cases where police did not know the name of the allegedly abducted child, often as the result of misunderstandings by witnesses who reported an abduction.</em></p>
<p><em>Seventy of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in 2004 (30%) were actually children taken by strangers or who were unlawfully traveling with adults other than their legal guardians.<br/>HT - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert</a></em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Controversies</strong></p>
<p><em>Some outside scholars examining the system in depth disagree with the ""official"" results. [43][44][45] A team led by University of Nevada criminologist Timothy Griffin looked at hundreds of abduction cases between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber Alerts actually played little apparent role in the eventual return of abducted children. Furthermore, AMBER Alerts tended to be ""successful"" in relatively mundane abductions, such as when the child was taken by a noncustodial parent or other family member. There was little evidence that Amber Alerts routinely ""saved lives"", although a crucial research constraint was the impossibility of knowing with certainty what ""would have"" happened if no Alert was issued in a particular case.</em></p>
<p><em>Advocates for missing children are concerned that the public is becoming desensitized to AMBER Alerts because of a large number of false alarms<br/>HT - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert</a></em></p>

<li>Orbital Laboratories, Inc. is a small start up company that is in the process of designing a new beacon system and network. It is a new wireless system that will allow people to find things that are important to them - wallets, pets, cars, strong boxes with important insurance information, and the most precious thing of all, CHILDREN. This is NOT like other Bluetooth devices you may have seen. We currently own 2 patents on our system with one pending.<br/><br/><br/><img alt=""Orbital Finder Wheel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.orbitallaboratories.com/finder/images/cf/finderWheel.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Orbital Finder Wheel""/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>With this funding, in addition to the initial support we've already received from friends and families of Orbital, we will realize a new system of finding items, especially children. Our plan is to work with the Amber Alert system. We are currently in collaboration with another patent holder whose technology will eventually reduce the size of the beacon to a piece of jewelry, or to put it into the tag of clothing, or anything that your child always wears or carries with them. Our beacons are able to be labeled and re-labeled easily.<br/><br/><img alt=""CES 2014"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.orbitallaboratories.com/finder/images/cf/ces2014.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""CES 2014""/>
</li>

In street corners, milk cartons, bulletin boards, etc.  It’s a known fact that our loved ones, especially children, go MISSING all the time.  For whatever reason, THEY NEED TO BE FOUND!
 
 
DID YOU KNOW? 
As of December 31, 2011, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) contained 85,158 active missing person records. Juveniles under the age of 18 account for 37,371 (43.9%) of the records and 9,832 (11.5%) were for adults between the ages of 18 and 20. [""National Crime Information Center"". The Federal Bureau of Investigations. U.S. Federal Government, U.S. Department of Justice. Retrieved 19 December 2012.] HT - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert

During 2011, 678,860 missing person records were entered into NCIC, a decrease of 2.0% from the 692,944 records entered in 2010. Missing person records cleared or canceled during the same period totaled 679,511. Reasons for these removals include a law enforcement agency located the subject, the individual returned home, or the record had to be removed by the entering agency due to a determination that it is invalid.[""NCIC Missing Person and Unidentified Person Statistics for 2007"". National Crime Information Center’s (NCIC) Missing Person File (Federal Bureau of Investigations). U.S. Federal Government, U.S. Department of Justice. Retrieved 19 December 2012.] HT - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert
THERE IS HELP…
The AMBER Alert™ Program is a voluntary partnership between law-enforcement agencies, broadcasters, transportation agencies, and the wireless industry, to activate an urgent bulletin in the most serious child-abduction cases. The goal of an AMBER Alert is to instantly galvanize the entire community to assist in the search for and the safe recovery of the child.  [HT - http://www.amberalert.gov/]
 
HOWEVER
To avoid both false alarms and having alerts ignored as a ""wolf cry"", the criteria for issuing an alert are rather strict. 
The U.S. Department of Justice issues the following ""guidance"", which most states are said to ""adhere closely to"" (in the U.S.):[13] 
     Law enforcement must confirm that an abduction has taken place.    The child must be at risk of serious injury or death.    There must be sufficient descriptive information of child, captor,         or captor's vehicle to issue an alert.    The child must be 17 years old or younger.
Many law enforcement agencies have not used #2 as a criterion, resulting in many parental abductions triggering an Amber Alert, where the child is not known or assumed to be at risk of serious injury or death.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, of the children abducted by strangers and murdered, 75% are killed within the first three hours. Amber Alerts are designed to inform the general public quickly when a child has been kidnapped and is in danger so that ""the public [would be] additional eyes and ears of law enforcement"".[11] As of August 2002, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported that 17 children had been successfully recovered after an Amber alert was issued, including one case in which the abductor released the child after hearing the alert.
A Scripps Howard study of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in the United States in 2004 found that most issued alerts did not meet the Department of Justice's criteria. Fully 50% (117 alerts) were categorized by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children as being ""family abductions"", very often a parent involved in a custody dispute. There were 48 alerts for children who had not been abducted at all, but were lost, ran away, involved in family misunderstandings (for example, two instances where the child was with grandparents), or as the result of hoaxes. Another 23 alerts were issued in cases where police did not know the name of the allegedly abducted child, often as the result of misunderstandings by witnesses who reported an abduction.
Seventy of the 233 AMBER Alerts issued in 2004 (30%) were actually children taken by strangers or who were unlawfully traveling with adults other than their legal guardians.HT - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert
 
Controversies
Some outside scholars examining the system in depth disagree with the ""official"" results. [43][44][45] A team led by University of Nevada criminologist Timothy Griffin looked at hundreds of abduction cases between 2003 and 2006 and found that Amber Alerts actually played little apparent role in the eventual return of abducted children. Furthermore, AMBER Alerts tended to be ""successful"" in relatively mundane abductions, such as when the child was taken by a noncustodial parent or other family member. There was little evidence that Amber Alerts routinely ""saved lives"", although a crucial research constraint was the impossibility of knowing with certainty what ""would have"" happened if no Alert was issued in a particular case.
Advocates for missing children are concerned that the public is becoming desensitized to AMBER Alerts because of a large number of false alarmsHT - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_alert
 
WE NEED TO ACTIVELY GET INVOLVED!
 


Orbital Laboratories, Inc. is a small start up company that is in the process of designing a new beacon system and network. It is a new wireless system that will allow people to find things that are important to them - wallets, pets, cars, strong boxes with important insurance information, and the most precious thing of all, CHILDREN. This is NOT like other Bluetooth devices you may have seen. We currently own 2 patents on our system with one pending.

With this funding, in addition to the initial support we've already received from friends and families of Orbital, we will realize a new system of finding items, especially children. Our plan is to work with the Amber Alert system. We are currently in collaboration with another patent holder whose technology will eventually reduce the size of the beacon to a piece of jewelry, or to put it into the tag of clothing, or anything that your child always wears or carries with them. Our beacons are able to be labeled and re-labeled easily.

This unique system utilizes a powered cell phone case with initial support for the I-phone 3-5 models. Our plans is to complete the case and beacons by the end of August for beta testing, and show the system at the CES in 2014, with a limited release for the holidays.

This may sound like other ""locator"" projects that are out there but ours is covered by multiple patents, and with a range of up to one mile. You can also pair the system to other phones to create an electronic search party.


What We Need & What You Get

This funding will allow us to finish the phone case design with 6 models, as well as create what we call beacon DNA - beacons that can be attached to anything but also have an I/O port for other products to plug into.

For assisting us in this campaign, all contributors will get a perk on rollout. The fact is, we need these across the USA to test and refine the electronic ability of the system. There will be other perks in this program, including a game that will be free to all initial members. This game, which will be a free download, is based on the beacons.

All of the funds received will be used. We are also seeking private donations and are working on larger commitments. For instance, we have a company that is ready to move our products nationwide, and will be allowing us to use their booth at CES in 2014. So distribution is not a problem.


The Impact
This is the first time we are using this avenue for funding. With that being said, there are other projects that we have taken on and completed. This includes a new design of Television for use in Afghanistan by our troops. We completed and shipped 1,200 special televisions to our troops at Bagram Air Base in January of 2012. We have spent the rest of our time gathering the technology necessary and getting our Patents in order.
We have other products that are going to market this year including new Televisions under the name Orbital that will be available on Amazon next month.
It is never easy building something that does not yet exist. However, our team of engineers as well as our manufacturing partners are also picking up the upfront manufacturing costs to get us into production. Everyone is contributing where they can. The bottom line is, this money will allow us to help complete the work, and enable to people to track and recover children. This is why we will continue to lower the costs as permitted by the new technologies that are at our disposal.
Other Ways You Can Help
Finally, we are looking for exposure for our product lines and ideas. We need everyone’s support to get the word out on what we are about, and what we will achieve in the near future. Please help us on facebook and other social network places to get the word out! And also, please don’t forget to use your share tools available here on this site as well.  Thank you!.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign
