<p>SuperSuit is not from Earth. It's forged from technology light years away, from the planet Xelotor. Xelotor has a much advanced life form than humans. Primitive life on Xelotor resembled the humans, but soon the wise ones unlocked the secret to the Universe. They realized many eons ago that the Universe was created through a spontaneous Play between the atoms and that Play was the highest form of creative energy. Hence they used Play to preserve their wisdom and pass it on through generations. Everything on Xelotor is done through Play and instead of conquest, they seek balance &amp; harmony.</p>
<p>However 9.34 billion years ago before the Earth was formed, a catastrophe tore Xelotor apart and threatened this very Balance!!! Most of the planets of its planetary system were destroyed. But Xelotor magically stayed suspended in the split state. You see the core of the planet is where the wise ones had hidden the mystical crystal Krato, source of the creation energy. The planet hung in this delicate balance. It got solar locked with Imba, which means one side always gets light and one side is always dark. Hence very different life forms evolved on either side and also made one side richer in resources. Hence started the great conflict which remains till date and threatens the delicate balance of Krato’s energy. At the edge of the Solar side &amp; the Dark side, various Zoro clans thrive. Zoros are extremely notorious creatures, who change loyalty depending on which side is prospering!</p>
<p>SuperSuit is a living entity. The center of the SuperSuit, the soul gem, is made of parts from the Krato. It is powered by your life energy. By playing SuperSuit, you keep this energy alive. The fate of Xelotor now rests in your hands.</p>

<p>SuperSuit uses new Zi-Fi™ technology to communicate suit to suit, so they work anywhere. Zi-Fi™ had to be created to make SuperSuit truly screenless. SuperSuit doesn't need a phone or PC or a WiFi / Bluetooth connection to be around. With Zi-Fi™ you can take these suits to a park / beach or even a desert and they'll start talking to each other right out of the box. We have been asked time and again why we have not just relied on existing protocols. We wrote a <a href=""http://www.bit.ly/zi-fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog here</a>. In short, WiFi is just too power hungry, ZigBee has a single point of failure, Bluetooth is connection oriented and ANT is geared towards periodic sensor reading transmissions. Zi-Fi™ emits permissible levels of radiation which is safe for use by children &amp; adults. It is similar to that of Wi-Fi.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/1ZUD6jh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Natural Gesture Processing Technology for Embedded Gaming.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/JUQ18r8.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>ENGaGE™ is the gesture engine that unleashes the magic behind all the ""superpowers"", from activating Force Fields to unleashing Shock Waves with a swish of your hands in superhero style! It is the first natural gesture processing technology for embedded gaming. It recognizes macro gestures done by players while moving across a 3D space, to trigger actions in a game environment and to control bots. ENGaGE’s Machine Learning subsystem learns complex new gestures, allowing SuperSuit game developers to program their own custom gestures.</p>
<br/>Here’s a blog detailing the <a href=""http://www.bit.ly/zi-fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">super tech behind SuperSuit</a>.<p> </p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">SuperVest is the power core of SuperSuit. It's designed in the form of a lightweight chest unit. It lights up, makes sound and has haptic feedback letting you Feeeel when you get Zapped! It slides perfectly over your shoulders and comes with adjustable straps and buckle, making it easy to wear and ensuring a perfect fit. As you keep playing, it’s machine learning engine adapts to your playing style. It communicates with the other suits, and its own SuperGlove &amp; SuperBot using the proprietary Zi-Fi™ radio technology. As you put it on, don’t be surprised if your inner superhero comes out!</span></p> <p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/DMCNmRC.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/i8ycr8f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/DLSrQ1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;text-align: justify;"">SuperGlove is the hand unit that goes over the forearm and closes over the fist. The triggers on it let you Zap and Zip other players. So you can Zap other players (take resources from them) as well as Zip (give resources to them). It has an inbuilt, advanced gesture engine powered by proprietary ENGaGE™ technology, that converts complex natural gestures into power-ups for your game. It is used to choose the game you want to play and displays vital scoring information on its screen during the game. Its IR blaster along with ambient light sensor works together to increase accuracy and Zapping range.</span></p> <p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/lUX014t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/WGKFlKn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imgur.com/chs0OAk.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;text-align:justify;"">SuperBot is the sidekick to your superhero. It’s a detachable smart bot that fits into the SuperVest. It can act as an ally by sensing other players and Zapping at them, or it can be used to boost your defense or be the goal of the game. You can connect as many bots in a game as you want. It can also be used to practise and perfect your own game.</span></p>

<p>We are a fiercely passionate team of 16, working relentlessly on making SuperSuit a reality for the last two years. Why did we take so long to launch on crowdfunding? We wanted to do ALL the testing that was needed and be sure this was going to be a reality before putting it in your hands. That is more than a thousand testing sessions, speaking &amp; showcasing to experts at leading conferences like CES (Vegas), Mobile World Congress (Barcelona), INK (Goa), TechCrunch Disrupt (SF) and much more.</p>

<p><b><u>About SuperSuit</u></b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can you see the laser beams shown in the video? Won't people be disappointed when they find out you can't?</strong></p>
<p>Far from being disappointed, people are wowed even more when they try out SuperSuit in person. It's such an experiential product that the video cannot do justice to the haptics you'll feel when getting zapped, the rush of doing the shock wave gesture &amp; seeing all surrounding suits shut down and truly getting to experience what it'd be like to play a video game in real life! We've tested with thousands of people and put together a showreel capturing these emotions.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6LZS9WhG1o?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Although you can't physically see the laser beams, there is a laser pointer which shows you the target and you see the rest in your mind. In fact, you see much more when doing the gesture superpowers - it's not uncommon to see people imagining themselves unleashing a force ripple through their surroundings when doing the shock wave. We have merely tried to capture that in the video.</p>
<p><b>How many people can play SuperSuit at a time?</b></p>
<p>It depends on the game. SuperSuit does not have any limitations to that but we recommend up to 15 people for an optimal play experience.</p>
<p><b>What is SuperSuit’s range / How far can players Zap each other from?</b></p>
<p>The range depends on the environment and would range from 100-200 ft. (30-60m) depending on obstacles in the path. Zi-Fi also “hops” from player to player, so the range ends up extending to be much higher.</p>
<p><b>What if a player goes out of range while playing the game?</b></p>
<p>SuperSuit is powered by Zi-Fi™ which allows players to go in and out of play range without affecting the game. A suit is notified as soon as it is about to step out of range, and is put in an inactive state. The player may then move closer to the play area and is notified once he is back in range and is activated for play.</p>
<p><b>Whom do I contact, if SuperSuit has a problem/glitch/damage?</b></p>
<p>Just email <a href=""mailto:hello@supersuit.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>hello@supersuit.io</span></a> .</p>
<p><b>Is Zi-Fi safe in terms of radiation?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Zi-Fi emits permissible levels of radiation which are proven to be safe for use by children &amp; adults. It is in the same range as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p><b>How do I choose my suit color?</b></p>
<p>You will get a form to personalize your suit shortly after the campaign.</p>
<p><b>Will SuperSuit fit me / What sizes does SuperSuit come in?</b></p>
<p>SuperSuit comes in a uni-body size and fits everyone from 7-year-olds to adults.</p>
<p><b>Does SuperSuit need a phone to play?</b></p>
<p>No, it does not need a phone to play. In fact, it works right out of the box without needing a phone, computer, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth around. A small display on the SuperGlove helps you choose the games and gives all the necessary information related to the game.</p>
<p><b>Do we need to install any batteries in SuperSuit?</b></p>
<p>No. SuperSuit comes with rechargeable Lithium ion batteries like your smartphones. They are good for more than 4 hours of active play. That means charging just twice a week even with daily use.</p>
<p><b>Does SuperSuit need a special charger?</b></p>
<p>SuperSuit uses standard USB connector (type micro-B) and ships with chargers so you don’t have to look around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><u>About Games &amp; Gameplay</u></b></p>
<p><b>How do I add my friends to my game?</b></p>

<p><b>Can I setup my profile on SuperSuit?</b></p>
<p>Yes. SuperSuit remembers you. Each time you play it updates your scores, gives you experience points and unlocks any superpowers as a result of it. It remembers your activity levels and games played. You can sync this data with your phone and compare scores with friends &amp; use many more features.</p>

Player Reactions


Parent Reactions

 

SuperSuit is not from Earth. It's forged from technology light years away, from the planet Xelotor. Xelotor has a much advanced life form than humans. Primitive life on Xelotor resembled the humans, but soon the wise ones unlocked the secret to the Universe. They realized many eons ago that the Universe was created through a spontaneous Play between the atoms and that Play was the highest form of creative energy. Hence they used Play to preserve their wisdom and pass it on through generations. Everything on Xelotor is done through Play and instead of conquest, they seek balance & harmony.
However 9.34 billion years ago before the Earth was formed, a catastrophe tore Xelotor apart and threatened this very Balance!!! Most of the planets of its planetary system were destroyed. But Xelotor magically stayed suspended in the split state. You see the core of the planet is where the wise ones had hidden the mystical crystal Krato, source of the creation energy. The planet hung in this delicate balance. It got solar locked with Imba, which means one side always gets light and one side is always dark. Hence very different life forms evolved on either side and also made one side richer in resources. Hence started the great conflict which remains till date and threatens the delicate balance of Krato’s energy. At the edge of the Solar side & the Dark side, various Zoro clans thrive. Zoros are extremely notorious creatures, who change loyalty depending on which side is prospering!
SuperSuit is a living entity. The center of the SuperSuit, the soul gem, is made of parts from the Krato. It is powered by your life energy. By playing SuperSuit, you keep this energy alive. The fate of Xelotor now rests in your hands.
 


 

 
SuperSuit introduces a new genre of strategy games based on ‘Balance’, called the Xelotor Games, and upgrades the outdoor classics with technology, called the Earth Games. Enjoy 15 pre-loaded games and download more from the SuperSuit App.
 
 


 
Vision for a unifying networking standard for Gen Z toys. 
SuperSuit uses new Zi-Fi™ technology to communicate suit to suit, so they work anywhere. Zi-Fi™ had to be created to make SuperSuit truly screenless. SuperSuit doesn't need a phone or PC or a WiFi / Bluetooth connection to be around. With Zi-Fi™ you can take these suits to a park / beach or even a desert and they'll start talking to each other right out of the box. We have been asked time and again why we have not just relied on existing protocols. We wrote a blog here. In short, WiFi is just too power hungry, ZigBee has a single point of failure, Bluetooth is connection oriented and ANT is geared towards periodic sensor reading transmissions. Zi-Fi™ emits permissible levels of radiation which is safe for use by children & adults. It is similar to that of Wi-Fi. 
Natural Gesture Processing Technology for Embedded Gaming.

ENGaGE™ is the gesture engine that unleashes the magic behind all the ""superpowers"", from activating Force Fields to unleashing Shock Waves with a swish of your hands in superhero style! It is the first natural gesture processing technology for embedded gaming. It recognizes macro gestures done by players while moving across a 3D space, to trigger actions in a game environment and to control bots. ENGaGE’s Machine Learning subsystem learns complex new gestures, allowing SuperSuit game developers to program their own custom gestures.
Here’s a blog detailing the super tech behind SuperSuit. 
 


A SuperSuit contains:
 

SuperVest is the power core of SuperSuit. It's designed in the form of a lightweight chest unit. It lights up, makes sound and has haptic feedback letting you Feeeel when you get Zapped! It slides perfectly over your shoulders and comes with adjustable straps and buckle, making it easy to wear and ensuring a perfect fit. As you keep playing, it’s machine learning engine adapts to your playing style. It communicates with the other suits, and its own SuperGlove & SuperBot using the proprietary Zi-Fi™ radio technology. As you put it on, don’t be surprised if your inner superhero comes out! 
SuperGlove is the hand unit that goes over the forearm and closes over the fist. The triggers on it let you Zap and Zip other players. So you can Zap other players (take resources from them) as well as Zip (give resources to them). It has an inbuilt, advanced gesture engine powered by proprietary ENGaGE™ technology, that converts complex natural gestures into power-ups for your game. It is used to choose the game you want to play and displays vital scoring information on its screen during the game. Its IR blaster along with ambient light sensor works together to increase accuracy and Zapping range. 
SuperBot is the sidekick to your superhero. It’s a detachable smart bot that fits into the SuperVest. It can act as an ally by sensing other players and Zapping at them, or it can be used to boost your defense or be the goal of the game. You can connect as many bots in a game as you want. It can also be used to practise and perfect your own game.
 

 

 


 


 


Various Play Sessions

 
 

 


We are a fiercely passionate team of 16, working relentlessly on making SuperSuit a reality for the last two years. Why did we take so long to launch on crowdfunding? We wanted to do ALL the testing that was needed and be sure this was going to be a reality before putting it in your hands. That is more than a thousand testing sessions, speaking & showcasing to experts at leading conferences like CES (Vegas), Mobile World Congress (Barcelona), INK (Goa), TechCrunch Disrupt (SF) and much more.
We are a diverse team with varied skills and backgrounds with an open culture. We just have two requirements that someone on the team must share -
1. Best at what you do in the World – This is Non-negotiable. You have to be absolutely world class at what you do. We don’t mean in terms of track record – you may have come from the best universities or unknown ones, but can you deliver? It's not easy to match pace with us.
2. Total belief in the Vision – You will be working slightly more than 24 hrs in a day, everyday, because that’s what it takes to make a dent in the universe. And unless you have complete faith in the vision for an active lifestyle, you won't be able to.
   
SuperSuit SDK is in the works and the developer community is going to be a big part of SuperSuit's future. However, it would be premature to give details about it now, till we have the product out. We will publish a blog on it soon, sharing the tools we have been building to create & test various games and interactions on SuperSuit.

<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">We have been working fulltime on Riftforge for the last four years, paying for everything ourselves. We have pitched it to both investors and publishers. However, as Brian Fargo pointed out in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4NkADMQwzg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Torment: Tides of Numenera</a>: investors and publishers are only interested in games that are ""accessible"" and addictive, i.e. Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, or Farmville.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are turning to </span><b>YOU</b> and Indiegogo instead. We would like to keep Riftforge <b style=""font-weight: normal;"">a game where skill and dedication matter, an RPG where you have real choices and your characters reflect your specific game style</b>, in short, <b>old school</b>!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">We would like to offer you a choice when it comes to payments: get the complete game for a set amount (i.e. campaign mode), or start playing for free and pay when you want to save time (i.e. fremium mode). <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163832/files/20131030083255-game-details.png?1383147175"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Here's four things about Riftforge that you are going to love:</p>
<a href=""http://play.riftforge.com/?utm_content=invite&amp;code=indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Riftforge has 70+ unique skills"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/165721/files/20131031011317-showeffects.png?1383207197"" src="""" style=""float: right; padding-top: 22px; width: 154px; height: 732px;"" title=""Riftforge has 70+ unique skills""/></a>
<ul style=""font-size: 15px;"">
<li style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Deep, tactical combat</b><br/>In addition to normal attacks and various passive abilities (e.g. Dodge or Block), Riftforge has over 70 unique skills: direct damage, damage over time, buffs, debuffs, control, relocation, terrain skills (e.g. mines or traps). These are implemented as <b>skill effects</b>, so we can combine  effects to create new skills.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic; color: #777;"">For example, you can pull an enemy close (RELOCATE), poison him (DOT) and blind him (DEBUFF). You can then drink his blood (LIFESTEAL) to get everyone enraged (MASS BUFF), all as one skill. Most skills, however, are kept very straight-forward.</span></span><br/><br/>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Fun, balanced classes</b><br/> We've been fine-tuning archetypes for almost 2 years, so you can have a balanced match at the  multiplayer Arena.<br/><br/>Balance doesn't mean weak or bland! You'll still be able to collect over 40 classes. Some are capable of decimating Riftforge’s external enemies almost single-handedly.<br/>(Yeah, Plaguerats, you just might live up to your name.)</span><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>New fantasy world</b><br/> A huge continent awaits exploration and conquest. <b>Icecrest Bay</b> alone is home to over a dozen hostile species. We are staying away from cliches like pointy ears or hairy feet. Yet, we love the concept of uplifted and hybrid species, so don’t be surprised to see uplifted apes or hybrid spiderfolk.</span><br/><br/>
</li>
<li style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Military style</b><br/> We don't like bullshit, so we keep ""lore"" on the light side. When you meet a vicious Caldarian Secutor, you will care about killing him before he kills your entire troop. Maybe he missed a few hugs as a kid, maybe not. It’s a war! No one has time to stay a while and listen to the Secutor's tragic story of unhappy childhood. </span><br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/163835/files/20131030083337-3campaign.png?1383147217"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">We would like to expand Riftforge combat with three campaigns (a.k.a. quest chains). Each will focus on a certain style of combat. In addition to <b>TWENTY handcrafted missions</b>, these campaigns will include the corresponding rewards: elite troops and rare equipment.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">These campaigns will give you a chance to participate actively in Riftforge's development. You will have an active role in developing the story line. You will also be able to choose your preferred opponent in each campaign. Hate spoilers? No worries, we do have a few ideas for surprise endings up our sleeves!</p>
<h1>Light campaign</h1>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">The light campaign stands for agile warriors, most of them female in appearance. They will act as <b>skirmishers, harassers, and <a href=""http://www.riftforge.com/news/elite-assassins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stealthy assassins</a></b>. Your challenge will be to pin down these light attackers and find a way to deal with their swarming tactics. Terrain will also play a part: exploring hidden temples and destroying sacrificial altars.</p><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;""></p>
<img alt=""Light enemies: Syrran vs Aradin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/165759/files/20131031021545-enemy-collage1.png?1383210945"" src="""" style="""" title=""Light enemies: Syrran vs Aradin""/><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">We would like you to indicate which race you would prefer to serve as common enemy for the campaign. On the left, you have the Syrrans, an amphibian hybrid race. On the right, you have the Aradins, another hybrid race, that's highly mobile.</p>
<h1>Heavy campaign</h1>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">In contrast to the light campaign, the heavy one will focus on strong individual fighters: <b>brutes of incredible strength and battle prowess</b>. The main challenge will be surviving lethal hits, or rather, dancing around them. Capturing mines and looting camp sites will add variety in terms of objectives.</p><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;""></p>
<img alt=""Heavy enemies: Quddar vs Vhanar"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/165761/files/20131031021745-enemy-collage2.png?1383211065"" src="""" style="""" title=""Heavy enemies: Quddar vs Vhanar""/><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Again, we'd like your call on which will make the best brute! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">On your left, it's the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">uplifted race known as Quddar. Their champion is a super-heavy infantryman, almost twice the size of a human. On the right, it's the Vhanar, an uplifted race famous for their tempestuous charges.</span></p>
<h1>Boss campaign</h1>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Finally, the campaigns will culminate in a really EPIC confrontation with a monstrous creature of almost <b>godlike power and cunning</b>. The path to the final battle will be terrifying but conquering your fear will be your easiest task. Defeating this monster will be an impressive accomplishment, worthy of a very, very special reward.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Just like with the other campaigns, we would like to get your input on the type of NEMESIS you would love (or hate) to face. Maybe you are partial to Lovecraft's ancient horrors, or maybe you would prefer a comicbook-style villain with super powers.</p>
<h1>Expand the game world</h1>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Below is a visual representation of what we plan to accomplish with your help. Icecrest Bay consists of nine (3x3) warzones. Riftforge is currently engaged in a vicious campaign in Caldaria (bottom right warzone).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/197096/files/20131114074114-icecrest-campaigns-580.jpg?1384443674"" src="""" style="""" title=""Icecrest Bay summer""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">With your help, we'd like to venture beyond Caldaria and explore the neighboring warzones. If you are generous enough for us to go an extra mile, there are 5 additional warzones that we would love to give life to!</p>
<h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/174426/files/20131104083334-indiegogo-perks.png?1383582814"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;""><br/></p><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Steve Jobs said once that the journey is the reward. Be that as it may...</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Help us complete Riftforge and enjoy some amazing rewards. First, there's the game rewards that would come with these epic campaigns: unique troops with new skills, tons of loot, and riches beyond imagining.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Then, there are the goodie bags, i.e. physical rewards like <b>posters and special maps</b>. Finally, you can <b>contribute </b>to the game individually and leave your name in Riftforge history, in the form of a epic weapon, new heroic class, or even a whole new campaign.</p><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">Here's a break-down of the stuff you'll find at the various perk levels.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"">Complete game (campaign editions)</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px;"">First, there is the no-frills base edition: you download and install the application and play every campaign on our campaign server for as long as you want. This base edition is priced at $29.95 but you can get it for a limited time at a whopping 40% discount. <br/><b>See our featured perk: campaign edition for just $18</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are several DELUXE editions that you can choose from as well. There are </span><b>NO gameplay advantages</b> to purchasing a deluxe edition. They offer the same great content and same level playing field. The difference is that deluxe editions include a number of future updates (expansions) as well as deluxe goodie bags.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"">Mission packs</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A Riftforge mission can come in three different levels: basic, special, and rare. A mission pack contains 7 missions, selected at random from the pool of all available missions. Standard mission packs contain 4 basic, 2 special, and one rare missions. You can purchase them with gold or you can get a set number for free by picking one of the perks.<br/><br/>
Note: Since our </span><b>free server is already live</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">, when you get a perk that contains mission packs, you get them </span><b>IMMEDIATELY</b>. Just let us know and we'll transfer them to you!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"">Starter kits</p>
<p style=""font-size: 15px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Starter kits are collections of equipment that help you up to about level 15 (level 30 is the maximum). They do not affect game balance in the PvP arena, only your early encounters with the enemies of Riftforge. Overall, you will feel like a friendly veteran gave you his old, battle-tested equipment. Again, these are available </span><b>IMMEDIATELY</b>.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"">Unique map</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/174361/files/20131104074718-riftforge-map-sm.jpg?1383580038"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">It's inspired by <a href=""http://www.wetanz.com/thorin-s-map-prop-replica/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thorin's treasure map</a>, sold by WETA for $199. The difference is that Thorin's map is drawn by a calligrapher, while Riftforge is hand-drawn by a Master cartographer: <a href=""http://sapiento.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Altbauer, a.k.a.

<p style=""font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal;"">The map is printed on the same premium 100% cotton archival paper. The distressing and aging is done with inks and pigments, entirely by hand.<br/><br/>The first 50 maps will also feature an exclusive *spoiler* location, unique to your map!</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;"">Posters and character artworks</p>

Riftforge is a modern game soul trapped in a pixel art body
Riftforge is NOT a retro game. Let not the art style fool you! We had to simplify graphics to make it past corporate firewalls, Flash plugins, Java, you name it. 
The gameplay mechanics are fully modern. For example, character skills match of those of League of Legends rather than Legend of Zelda. 

You cannot relive the past, you can only learn from it.
And learn from it we did! We took the openness and depth from RPG's like Baldur's Gate and Ultima and combined them with the tactical battles from Final Fantasy Tactics and XCom.

See if you spot our ""influences"":

Arrive magically from another world to Riftforge, a mysterious construct that creates temporary Rifts in space.
The High Council hires you as a mercenary commander.
Combine over 40+ classes to create the perfect party of six.
Customize troops and equipment before each individual battle. 
Fight battles on a tactical map with an isometric view.
Defeat dozens of enemy types using over 70 tactical and action skills.
Master the six types of battle and beat a hundred handcrafted missions.
Fail and your world is lost.
Succeed and you will be hailed as hailed as Supreme Warlord.
Anything original about Riftforge at all?
It sounds like we've mixed some great broccoli ice cream, doesn't it?
We did start with broccoli ice cream two years ago. After 20+ months of playtesting, we've distilled it into something almost pure: 60% proof brandy with a slight greenish tint.The point is most games ship with serious bugs and virtually no beta. Blizzard is one of the few that takes the time to PLAYTEST for months. 50,000 playtesters have playtested Riftforge, playing hundreds of thousands of battles. Some are on the team advising us right now!We've addressed dozens of issues plaguing the genre. Listing them all will take too much time but here's a few:

ridiculous misses - from D&D to XCom, you can miss from point-blank range


(unpredictably) long missions - you can't save and the mission lasts an hour?


low-level rewards - Diablo is the king of loot that's always below your level


single protagonist - replay the game if you want a different character


pay-to-win - true for ALL browser games; little or no singleplayer content either


Why don't you check out our free version and figure if you like the taste. See below: 
So Riftforge is free?
Yes and no. There are two separate modes on two servers:
Free server
You can start playing Riftforge on our free server. You start with your first 20 story missions for FREE. You can also freely engage in patrols, skirmishes, and multiplayer Arena as well. There's no pay-to-win but you can purchase extra singleplayer missions with real money. You can also get them by playing the game (rewards), paying in game currency (gold) or by inviting and playing with friends. There are no overpowered items or boosters for sale. The shop only offers missions. Some of Riftforge players prefer paying to save time but most of our top players don't pay a cent.Current status: Riftforge's free server is in LIVE BETA, after a playtest that lasted 20 months.
Campaign server
We are hard at work preparing a campaign server, so you can play Riftforge the way you play Guild Wars or Diablo. You purchase the complete game and ALL content is available to you to enjoy forever with no extra charges. This server offers a perfectly level playing field. There are NO microtransactions or premium purchases. The only way to gain advantage over other players is 100% old school: improve your skills and progress your characters.
Current status: Campaign server is 80% complete. 
How much is 80%? We've already done 100+ handcrafted missions in a dozen campaigns. There are 40+ classes that can either be recruited directly or can be received as rewards for completing campaigns. We would like to add three end-game campaigns that culminate in an awesome BOSS battle and this is...
Why we need you
We have been working fulltime on Riftforge for the last four years, paying for everything ourselves. We have pitched it to both investors and publishers. However, as Brian Fargo pointed out in Torment: Tides of Numenera: investors and publishers are only interested in games that are ""accessible"" and addictive, i.e. Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, or Farmville.
We are turning to YOU and Indiegogo instead. We would like to keep Riftforge a game where skill and dedication matter, an RPG where you have real choices and your characters reflect your specific game style, in short, old school!
We would like to offer you a choice when it comes to payments: get the complete game for a set amount (i.e. campaign mode), or start playing for free and pay when you want to save time (i.e. fremium mode). 


Riftforge is an isometric role-playing game with turn-based tactics


You start with Commander and 5 customizable troopers (i.e. a ""party""). 


You complete single-player missions, each with a specific set of challenges.


You can also climb the ranks by playing in the multiplayer Arena (optional)


Extra content comes as in the form of mission packs. On the free server, they cost gold or cash. On the campaign server, they cost (a lot less) gold.  

The game client is HTML5, which means it can be played on any modern browser (computers and tablets recommended, most phones are too small).
Campaign edition will be available as a free APPLICATION, downloaded and installed from Google's Web Store. Note: you will be able to play in other browsers but we recommend the application for best gameplay experience.


Here's four things about Riftforge that you are going to love:



Deep, tactical combatIn addition to normal attacks and various passive abilities (e.g. Dodge or Block), Riftforge has over 70 unique skills: direct damage, damage over time, buffs, debuffs, control, relocation, terrain skills (e.g. mines or traps). These are implemented as skill effects, so we can combine  effects to create new skills.For example, you can pull an enemy close (RELOCATE), poison him (DOT) and blind him (DEBUFF). You can then drink his blood (LIFESTEAL) to get everyone enraged (MASS BUFF), all as one skill. Most skills, however, are kept very straight-forward.


Fun, balanced classes We've been fine-tuning archetypes for almost 2 years, so you can have a balanced match at the  multiplayer Arena.Balance doesn't mean weak or bland! You'll still be able to collect over 40 classes. Some are capable of decimating Riftforge’s external enemies almost single-handedly.(Yeah, Plaguerats, you just might live up to your name.)


New fantasy world A huge continent awaits exploration and conquest. Icecrest Bay alone is home to over a dozen hostile species. We are staying away from cliches like pointy ears or hairy feet. Yet, we love the concept of uplifted and hybrid species, so don’t be surprised to see uplifted apes or hybrid spiderfolk.


Military style We don't like bullshit, so we keep ""lore"" on the light side. When you meet a vicious Caldarian Secutor, you will care about killing him before he kills your entire troop. Maybe he missed a few hugs as a kid, maybe not. It’s a war! No one has time to stay a while and listen to the Secutor's tragic story of unhappy childhood. 


We would like to expand Riftforge combat with three campaigns (a.k.a. quest chains). Each will focus on a certain style of combat. In addition to TWENTY handcrafted missions, these campaigns will include the corresponding rewards: elite troops and rare equipment.
These campaigns will give you a chance to participate actively in Riftforge's development. You will have an active role in developing the story line. You will also be able to choose your preferred opponent in each campaign. Hate spoilers? No worries, we do have a few ideas for surprise endings up our sleeves!
Light campaign
The light campaign stands for agile warriors, most of them female in appearance. They will act as skirmishers, harassers, and stealthy assassins. Your challenge will be to pin down these light attackers and find a way to deal with their swarming tactics. Terrain will also play a part: exploring hidden temples and destroying sacrificial altars.
We would like you to indicate which race you would prefer to serve as common enemy for the campaign. On the left, you have the Syrrans, an amphibian hybrid race. On the right, you have the Aradins, another hybrid race, that's highly mobile.
Heavy campaign
In contrast to the light campaign, the heavy one will focus on strong individual fighters: brutes of incredible strength and battle prowess. The main challenge will be surviving lethal hits, or rather, dancing around them. Capturing mines and looting camp sites will add variety in terms of objectives.
Again, we'd like your call on which will make the best brute! On your left, it's the uplifted race known as Quddar. Their champion is a super-heavy infantryman, almost twice the size of a human. On the right, it's the Vhanar, an uplifted race famous for their tempestuous charges.
Boss campaign
Finally, the campaigns will culminate in a really EPIC confrontation with a monstrous creature of almost godlike power and cunning. The path to the final battle will be terrifying but conquering your fear will be your easiest task. Defeating this monster will be an impressive accomplishment, worthy of a very, very special reward.
Just like with the other campaigns, we would like to get your input on the type of NEMESIS you would love (or hate) to face. Maybe you are partial to Lovecraft's ancient horrors, or maybe you would prefer a comicbook-style villain with super powers.
Expand the game world
Below is a visual representation of what we plan to accomplish with your help. Icecrest Bay consists of nine (3x3) warzones. Riftforge is currently engaged in a vicious campaign in Caldaria (bottom right warzone).

With your help, we'd like to venture beyond Caldaria and explore the neighboring warzones. If you are generous enough for us to go an extra mile, there are 5 additional warzones that we would love to give life to!

Most perks are still available at our site. Join Riftforge and go to Unlock!

Steve Jobs said once that the journey is the reward. Be that as it may...
Help us complete Riftforge and enjoy some amazing rewards. First, there's the game rewards that would come with these epic campaigns: unique troops with new skills, tons of loot, and riches beyond imagining.
Then, there are the goodie bags, i.e. physical rewards like posters and special maps. Finally, you can contribute to the game individually and leave your name in Riftforge history, in the form of a epic weapon, new heroic class, or even a whole new campaign.Here's a break-down of the stuff you'll find at the various perk levels.
Complete game (campaign editions)
First, there is the no-frills base edition: you download and install the application and play every campaign on our campaign server for as long as you want. This base edition is priced at $29.95 but you can get it for a limited time at a whopping 40% discount. See our featured perk: campaign edition for just $18.
There are several DELUXE editions that you can choose from as well. There are NO gameplay advantages to purchasing a deluxe edition. They offer the same great content and same level playing field. The difference is that deluxe editions include a number of future updates (expansions) as well as deluxe goodie bags.
Mission packs
A Riftforge mission can come in three different levels: basic, special, and rare. A mission pack contains 7 missions, selected at random from the pool of all available missions. Standard mission packs contain 4 basic, 2 special, and one rare missions. You can purchase them with gold or you can get a set number for free by picking one of the perks.
Note: Since our free server is already live, when you get a perk that contains mission packs, you get them IMMEDIATELY. Just let us know and we'll transfer them to you!
Starter kits
Starter kits are collections of equipment that help you up to about level 15 (level 30 is the maximum). They do not affect game balance in the PvP arena, only your early encounters with the enemies of Riftforge. Overall, you will feel like a friendly veteran gave you his old, battle-tested equipment. Again, these are available IMMEDIATELY.
Unique map
It's inspired by Thorin's treasure map, sold by WETA for $199. The difference is that Thorin's map is drawn by a calligrapher, while Riftforge is hand-drawn by a Master cartographer: Robert Altbauer, a.k.a. Sapiento. 
The map is printed on the same premium 100% cotton archival paper. The distressing and aging is done with inks and pigments, entirely by hand.The first 50 maps will also feature an exclusive *spoiler* location, unique to your map!
Posters and character artworks
We are including limited edition posters, along with character art done by exceptional fantasy artists, including the extremely talented Stefan Valkanov ""Rotorblade"" and world-famous Kerem Beyit, currently working for Wizards of the Coast and Blizzard.Riftforge's hyper-realistic character art really makes for great art prints, on par with anything seen by the great fantasy masters.Each poster will be signed, with a personal thank you note added.Ideally, we would like to give you TWO pieces of character art.That way, you can give as a gift to a friend and keep the one you REALLY like!
Miniatures and terrain trophies
We have contracted an artist with multiple Crystal Brush awards to paint our miniatures.While the miniatures are pro-painted, terrain... is hand-made right here in the studio. In fact, you'll be able to check your trophy's progress.Keep in mind, that unlike the miniature (right), your trophy is a significant piece and you will probably need a display stand or a mantelpiece.
That's right! Regardless of your contribution level, there's room for you to go UP.
Use ""Share This Campaign"" link at the top. It has your personal ID so when you post it, your friends can see Riftforge and get involved too. You get credit for each referral! The more people that use your link to donate to the campaign, the better your special prizes!
If you are one of the top referrers, you will be upgraded UP. Not just once but twice. Say you ordered the early Killer pack, you will be upgraded to Monster pack, or if you are real active, all the way to Avatar pack!Note: with the $1 Founder pack, you can only get upgraded to Six pack, however, with the Six pack, you can get upgraded to Killer pack. Keep those referrers coming!

It’s a message from the Bitrunner App; it says that it found a Bitcoin just a block down from your current location. You make a slight detour and head over there to claim your coin using the Bitrunner app. Now that you’ve got the Bitcoin in your in-game wallet you consult the Bitrunner app again and find the nearest Bitrunner Bank which happens to be located inside coffee shop on the next corner.

The game will always be free to download and play, which means you can actually make money by exploring your city and finding the hidden treasure. But, it's a competitive world out there and you'll do much better if you have an edge. You can team up with others and/or buy tools in the game that will give you a leg up on the competition. We will use the majority of these funds to put back into the eco system to make the game more profitable and fun for everyone. </p><h3>Where can I play?</h3><p>Just about anywhere on Earth - and once smart devices support IPPS (Inter Planetary Positioning System), the Moon, Mars and other planets. :) In the closed beta version we are likely to start small and focus on a handful of cities. </p><h3>What kinds of tools are available?</h3><p>There are lots of tools that will help you get a leg up on the competition. The tools that will be present in the first version of the game are: </p><ul>
<li><p><b>Shovel</b>: Normally, without any tools, you're trying to 'dig up' Bitcoins with your 'bare hands'. This can take a while. If you want to get at the treasure faster, and before your competitors do, you'll want a shovel. Shovels come in a variety of sizes and the bigger your shovel, the fast you can dig. Shovels, like most of the tools in the game, have a lifespan and will wear out over time. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Telescopes</b>: Telescopes help you see further around you. You'll get an edge by being able to see fields of Bitcoins farther away than your opponents and even see the opponents around you. Telescopes come in various powers, the greater the power the further you'll be able to see. Telescopes too have a lifetime and will stop working optimally after some time. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Explosives</b>: For those of you who like a little more aggressive strategy, you can plant mines that explode when an opponent gets within a certain range, or bombs that go off at a certain time of day or can even be detonated remotely by you. Explosives come with different blast radiuses, the larger the blast radius, the more coins from more opponents you'll get to pillage. With mines that are proximity detonated, you'll get an alert on your phone when your mine has been detonated so you can swoop in and collect the booty. There are certain areas where bombs and mines are not allowed to be placed, for example in the immediate vicinity of a Bitrunner Bank. Explosives, if not used for a long time will eventually start rusting and stop working.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Armor</b>: Weather you are playing dirty or not, you'll want to be protected from your opponents' aggressions. Buying armor is the best way to do that. Armor comes in various gauges, the stronger the armor, the less loss you'll sustain from a blast. Armor can be used until it encounters a blast stronger than it's current protection strength.</p></li>
</ul><h3>Where can I buy tools?  </h3><p>To buy tools, you'll visit a Bitrunner store. A Bitrunner store is a virtual store located in a physical space. Depending on how convenient the store is, you may be able to get better or worse bargains on tools. Like banks, stores are a safe zone where no one can plant bombs so have no fear when you go to by your armor to protect you form the cruel world. </p><h3>Where can I keep my Bitcoins safe while I go out exploring?</h3><p>One of the risks of collecting lots of coins and carrying them with you, is that if you encounter an opponent's explosive device, some or all or the coins you are carrying may be scattered about the blast area and you, because you're 'dead' won't be able to pick them up for some time. Armor can protect you from loss depending on the size of, and your proximity to the blast. One strategy you can use to keep your coins safe, is to deposit them into a Bitrunner Bank. Bitrunner Banks are virtual banks located in a physical space. You must physically go to the bank location to make a deposit or withdrawal. Zones around banks are a safe from bombs so that no one can perform ATM style holdups with clients carrying lots of treasure to deposit, or having just made a withdrawal. At Bitrunner banks, you can also change your Bitcoins for cash that will be deposited into your real-life bank account in dollars (or whatever the local currency is).  </p><h3>What are some of the strategies I can use to win?</h3><p>Bitrunner is social a game that only gets more fun when more people play. The addition of your friends (and maybe enemies) to the game opens some interesting possibilities. Now, you can form alliances, partnerships, wars and truces. How you decide to play is up to you. Whether you are a loner , just a little bit bad, or prefer to play with your friends and split the spoils, there's a strategy for you. Here are some examples that we came up with:</p><ul>
<li><p><b>Lone Miner</b>: You prefer to go it alone and live and let live. You find fields of Bitcoins, and harvest them. You might even find a field that only you know about and can go back to over and over to reap the benefits. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Miner Collective</b>: You’re a social creature and prefer working with people hand in hand to help the collective. You harvest zones in teams and everyone wins. You decide with whom you want to cooperate and how to divide up the fruits of your labor.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Cunning Plunderer</b>: You're just a little bit of a bad boy and don't mind using a little force where necessary. You map out your territory and protect it with explosive devices, then swoop in to collect the spoils. </p></li>
<li><p><b>The Wolf Pack</b>: You believe in safety in numbers and that the best hunting is done as a team. Like a pack of wolves you and your friends spread out over a territory to discover the most populous and profitable areas. You form plans of attack that take advantage of your numbers. If some of your friends have invested in special tools, like a telescope, they can share their knowledge with the whole team sharing with everyone the benefit of their investment. One for all and all for one!</p></li>
</ul><p>Of course, these are just examples and we encourage you to find your own strategy!</p><h3>Where do the Bitcoins come from? </h3><p>Bitcoins are found forming all over the earth’s surface at random locations, densities, age and value. Bitcoins are placed and managed by our app. Some areas have denser concentrations and other have less. Dense areas can be used for continuous “mining”, where you dig up, collect and go back for more some time later. The funds for them come from the in app purchases and location based partners, which include small businesses, franchises and government tourism agencies.</p><h3>Can I play with my drone? </h3><p>What a strange question you ask! Why yes! In Bitrunner, Bitcoins may be hidden at altitude so your drone, jetpack or personal helicopter are the perfect tools to collect them all from the sky. We imagine this feature will be developed in a later iteration.</p><h3>Why Bitcoin?</h3><p>As Bitcoin enthusiasts, we believe that virtual decentralized currencies are the future. One of our motivations is to help introduce this concept to young gamers and others who may not have had the opportunity to hear about this wave of the future. We chose Bitcoin of all the virtual currencies as it is the most well known and most mature of all of its peers.</p><h3>Why we need your support? </h3><p>We need your support to bring this innovative game to the world. We want to be able to focus our full attention on Bitrunner and develop and perfect the first version. We will use any funds that we gather to develop the software needed to deliver a superb gaming experience and to bootstrap the Bitcoins that will initially be distributed. We estimate that should we be fully funded, our team could develop the first version in about 6 months. </p><h3>Why Use Indiegogo?</h3><p>We chose to run a Indiegogo campaign because it offers the ability to go beyond traditional bootstrapping efforts to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of the most exciting features even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer in the first version launch! Beyond giving us the ability to help fund this effort, Indiegogo lets us connect with you! We wanted to give the community a voice in our product’s creation, and Indiegogo seemed like the perfect way to do that. </p><h2></h2><h3>Who is on our team?</h3><p>Our core team members are Nathan and Simon, both entrepreneurs at heart but with different specialities.

To help mitigate some of the challenges that we will inevitably face, we have assembled an expert advisory panel with education and experience in game theory, finance and psychology.

One of our motivations is to help introduce this concept to young gamers and others who may not have had the opportunity to hear about this wave of the future. We chose Bitcoin of all the virtual currencies as it is the most well known and most mature of all of its peers. We recognize that, as with anything this revolutionary, there are inherent risks. There are risks around adoption, infrastructure and fluctuations in value. While the game is premised on the belief that Bitcoin, in the end, will become the de facto virtual currency, there is nothing in the game which requires its use. We can just as easily use any other virtual or real currency, and are agile enough in our thinking that we will adapt as the environment evolves. In fact, to provide the lowest friction experience, tools will initially be purchased in-app, which necessarily involves traditional currencies which we will convert to virtual currency to fund the game eco-system.</p><p></p><h2>Contact</h2>Have any questions or ideas regarding the project?

If you want to get at the treasure faster, and before your competitors do, you'll want a shovel. Shovels come in a variety of sizes and the bigger your shovel, the fast you can dig. Shovels, like most of the tools in the game, have a lifespan and will wear out over time. 
Telescopes: Telescopes help you see further around you. You'll get an edge by being able to see fields of Bitcoins farther away than your opponents and even see the opponents around you. Telescopes come in various powers, the greater the power the further you'll be able to see. Telescopes too have a lifetime and will stop working optimally after some time. 
Explosives: For those of you who like a little more aggressive strategy, you can plant mines that explode when an opponent gets within a certain range, or bombs that go off at a certain time of day or can even be detonated remotely by you. Explosives come with different blast radiuses, the larger the blast radius, the more coins from more opponents you'll get to pillage. With mines that are proximity detonated, you'll get an alert on your phone when your mine has been detonated so you can swoop in and collect the booty. There are certain areas where bombs and mines are not allowed to be placed, for example in the immediate vicinity of a Bitrunner Bank. Explosives, if not used for a long time will eventually start rusting and stop working.
Armor: Weather you are playing dirty or not, you'll want to be protected from your opponents' aggressions. Buying armor is the best way to do that. Armor comes in various gauges, the stronger the armor, the less loss you'll sustain from a blast. Armor can be used until it encounters a blast stronger than it's current protection strength.
Where can I buy tools?  To buy tools, you'll visit a Bitrunner store. A Bitrunner store is a virtual store located in a physical space. Depending on how convenient the store is, you may be able to get better or worse bargains on tools. Like banks, stores are a safe zone where no one can plant bombs so have no fear when you go to by your armor to protect you form the cruel world. Where can I keep my Bitcoins safe while I go out exploring?One of the risks of collecting lots of coins and carrying them with you, is that if you encounter an opponent's explosive device, some or all or the coins you are carrying may be scattered about the blast area and you, because you're 'dead' won't be able to pick them up for some time. Armor can protect you from loss depending on the size of, and your proximity to the blast. One strategy you can use to keep your coins safe, is to deposit them into a Bitrunner Bank. Bitrunner Banks are virtual banks located in a physical space. You must physically go to the bank location to make a deposit or withdrawal. Zones around banks are a safe from bombs so that no one can perform ATM style holdups with clients carrying lots of treasure to deposit, or having just made a withdrawal. At Bitrunner banks, you can also change your Bitcoins for cash that will be deposited into your real-life bank account in dollars (or whatever the local currency is).  What are some of the strategies I can use to win?Bitrunner is social a game that only gets more fun when more people play. The addition of your friends (and maybe enemies) to the game opens some interesting possibilities. Now, you can form alliances, partnerships, wars and truces. How you decide to play is up to you. Whether you are a loner , just a little bit bad, or prefer to play with your friends and split the spoils, there's a strategy for you. Here are some examples that we came up with:
Lone Miner: You prefer to go it alone and live and let live. You find fields of Bitcoins, and harvest them. You might even find a field that only you know about and can go back to over and over to reap the benefits. 
Miner Collective: You’re a social creature and prefer working with people hand in hand to help the collective. You harvest zones in teams and everyone wins. You decide with whom you want to cooperate and how to divide up the fruits of your labor.
Cunning Plunderer: You're just a little bit of a bad boy and don't mind using a little force where necessary. You map out your territory and protect it with explosive devices, then swoop in to collect the spoils. 
The Wolf Pack: You believe in safety in numbers and that the best hunting is done as a team. Like a pack of wolves you and your friends spread out over a territory to discover the most populous and profitable areas. You form plans of attack that take advantage of your numbers. If some of your friends have invested in special tools, like a telescope, they can share their knowledge with the whole team sharing with everyone the benefit of their investment. One for all and all for one!
Of course, these are just examples and we encourage you to find your own strategy!Where do the Bitcoins come from? Bitcoins are found forming all over the earth’s surface at random locations, densities, age and value. Bitcoins are placed and managed by our app. Some areas have denser concentrations and other have less. Dense areas can be used for continuous “mining”, where you dig up, collect and go back for more some time later. The funds for them come from the in app purchases and location based partners, which include small businesses, franchises and government tourism agencies.Can I play with my drone? What a strange question you ask! Why yes! In Bitrunner, Bitcoins may be hidden at altitude so your drone, jetpack or personal helicopter are the perfect tools to collect them all from the sky. We imagine this feature will be developed in a later iteration.Why Bitcoin?As Bitcoin enthusiasts, we believe that virtual decentralized currencies are the future. One of our motivations is to help introduce this concept to young gamers and others who may not have had the opportunity to hear about this wave of the future. We chose Bitcoin of all the virtual currencies as it is the most well known and most mature of all of its peers.Why we need your support? We need your support to bring this innovative game to the world. We want to be able to focus our full attention on Bitrunner and develop and perfect the first version. We will use any funds that we gather to develop the software needed to deliver a superb gaming experience and to bootstrap the Bitcoins that will initially be distributed. We estimate that should we be fully funded, our team could develop the first version in about 6 months. Why Use Indiegogo?We chose to run a Indiegogo campaign because it offers the ability to go beyond traditional bootstrapping efforts to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of the most exciting features even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer in the first version launch! Beyond giving us the ability to help fund this effort, Indiegogo lets us connect with you! We wanted to give the community a voice in our product’s creation, and Indiegogo seemed like the perfect way to do that. Who is on our team?Our core team members are Nathan and Simon, both entrepreneurs at heart but with different specialities. Nathan is a software architect with decades of development expertise and Simon is an expert in User Interface and User Experience design. We also have a board of advisers who are experts in bitcoin, psychology and game theory who are at our disposal.Nathan Pahucki Co-FounderSoftware engineer, Entrepreneur Linkedin: http://cl.linkedin.com/in/nathanpahucki

We also realize that it is no small feat to create something that will keep players engaged and excited to play and offer real value to them. While the team has decades of software development and UX experience under their belt, this will be the first massively multiplayer mobile game that we develop. To help mitigate some of the challenges that we will inevitably face, we have assembled an expert advisory panel with education and experience in game theory, finance and psychology. We feel that the usual risks and challenges that normally come with creating and managing a software project are already well addressed by our extensive collective experience in this field.As Bitcoin enthusiasts, we believe that virtual decentralized currencies are the future. One of our motivations is to help introduce this concept to young gamers and others who may not have had the opportunity to hear about this wave of the future. We chose Bitcoin of all the virtual currencies as it is the most well known and most mature of all of its peers. We recognize that, as with anything this revolutionary, there are inherent risks. There are risks around adoption, infrastructure and fluctuations in value. While the game is premised on the belief that Bitcoin, in the end, will become the de facto virtual currency, there is nothing in the game which requires its use. We can just as easily use any other virtual or real currency, and are agile enough in our thinking that we will adapt as the environment evolves. In fact, to provide the lowest friction experience, tools will initially be purchased in-app, which necessarily involves traditional currencies which we will convert to virtual currency to fund the game eco-system.ContactHave any questions or ideas regarding the project?

Simply tap to gun them down! When you survive a wave, the day passes and the night comes. The night is when you have the ability to buy different weapons, upgrade your fortress, buy helpers, and more.</p>

<p>We are two indie developers trying to make this awesome game a reality, CaptainLepidus (Capt) and SirGuy (Sir). We are very excited about it, as it's the first commercial game we've pushed out. I, Sir, am based in Florida, and it's always sunny around here. Seriously, have you ever been here? No? You should. It's nice. :) Capt' lives somewhere else in the U.S., I dunno. He's not next door, and I see no reason to ask.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Idea!</h2>
<p>We discovered that there weren't any enjoyable defense games on the Apple Appstore - and set out to make one. We felt we could make an awesome game, and with your help, we can!</p>
<h2>The Money!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Alright, well, this is a very sticky topic, right? No one likes talking about money. So let me break this down for you.</p>
<p>We're asking for 1,500 dollars. I have no doubt you guys can make that happen.</p>
<p>Where's the money going?</p>
<ul>
<li>200 dollars is going towards software.</li>
<li>100 dollars is going towards an Apple License.</li>
<li>450 is going towards Art.</li>
<li>The remainging money will be used on a variety of things - extra art (so you can have a bigger, better game), promotion, and future game endeavors.</li>
</ul><p>So, as you can see, it's not like I'm asking for a whole lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Risks!</h2>
<p>Well, with this service, IndieGoGo, you can ask to keep the money even if you don't get everything you need. I'm not asking for that. If we don't earn the money, I'm dropping the whole project. That's why I need you! If we don't reach the funding that we need, the whole project gets dropped. Just wanted to repeat myself, there.</p>
<p>If we don't raise the money, then the art that's already created gets put on OpenGameArt, the code may or may not get released, and the programmers and artist go separate ways. I would prefer this not happen! To make sure it doesn't, I have some awesome rewards for you guys.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Rewards!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>You guys get to be part of the creation process! We, the Dev's, are willing to work with you guys to make this game. If you buy anything over 15 bucks, you get to be a part of the team! Not literally, but you do get to work with the Dev's to make something that will be in the final game. So, you get to leave your mark on this game. Want a dinosaur in the game? Buy the 50$ package and request a dinosaur! Want a massive, uber powerful pistol? Buy the 30$ package and request a pistol! We're legit, we want you to work with us.</p>
<p><br/>But, along with these awesome rewards that we're offering, I'd like to do something a little different. See, there's this thing on KickStarter called ""Stretch Goals"". I would like to add these to our campaign. So, here they are!</p>

After their parent's death, Tom and Angie's aunt took care of them from another country by sending them checks that she received from the government for being their legal guardian. With Tom’s 18th birthday coming up, their funding will be cut in half, resulting in the relocation to Shorewood.Shortly after starting school, thefts begin to take place around town. With Shorewood being such a small town and everyone knowing everyone, the suspicion of the “newcomers”  being the culprit of the thefts is unavoidable.Can you catch the real thief before you're labeled as a criminal and trialed as an adult right after graduation? Or, will you be able to identify the thief, and return what was stolen?In addition to the digital rewards like the Artbook and Soundtrack, we thought it would be cool to offer a couple other physical rewards.

<p>          <strong>Edemion </strong>was an ordinary Indian teenager of 14 years, living in his tribe ""Giniu"". He was studying military craft and helping with the house. Once upon a time village was attacked by invaders from other tribe - Avahi. Avahi often were raided other tribes in order to rob and capture people. The Giniu tribe was not ready for an attack, so all men of the village were killed, including Edemion’s father. Little Edemion was able to hide, but his mother and brother were captured and taken away. Boy was very sad and angry on himself, but eventually decided to find strength and release the captives from his tribe.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Will of Flame is a frenetic 2D arcade shoot ‘em up with a scoring system that rewards the most spectacular and original kills.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> In WOF you control a space bounty hunter riding alien beasts through a planet crawling with aggressive monsters. To achieve the revenge you’re seeking, you will have at your disposal a huge array of weapons, myriads of death traps scattered through the levels and a tractor rifle that lets you pick up enemies and drag them wherever you want. </span><b>How you combine all three means of destruction is up to you</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> and will determine your final score and the cool stuff you unlock.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/449660/files/20140321070225-Screenshots_12.jpg?1395410545"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We plan on bringing Will of Flame’s hectic action to the screens of <b>Android, iPhone and Windows Phone 8</b> devices as well as to <b>PC, Mac and Linux.</b> After two years of development, we have come to Indiegogo to enlist you in our commendable
mission. <b>Together we can deliver a modern tribute to the best of 2D gaming from the 90s:</b> the trigger-happy pace and humor of arcade gems like Metal Slug, combined with the charm and originality of Nintendo’s platformers and RPGs. In addition to the fun we will have making and playing Will of Flame, <b>there are some truly awesome perks you can get</b> by being part of this project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330181/files/20140126053443-banner_playthedemo.png?1390743283"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Before saying anything else, we want to let Will of Flame speak for itself. We have prepared a <b>demo</b> for you to get a small taste of what will be included in the full game. Please do take a couple seconds to read the <b>“How to Play”</b> first, keep in mind everything is <b>work in progress,</b> and don’t forget to <b>come back</b> when you’re done playing to hear the rest of what we have in store!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center; font-weight: normal;""><b><u>HOW TO PLAY (AVENGING 101):</u></b></p>
<p><b>1. SHOOT AND DODGE</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Use the <b>W,A,S,D keys to move around.</b> Aim and click with the mouse to shoot your enemies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Click on the weapon in the HUD or use <b>keys 1-9 to toggle between weapons.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">-<b>You can use
an Xbox 360 controller</b> any time you want, just turn it on and use the left
joystick to move, right joystick to aim, RT to shoot and LB and RB to switch weapons.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Pick up weapon cases to restock ammo, health kits and shields to stay alive, and gold coins just because they’re shiny (in the final game you’ll be able to spend them).</p>
<p><b>2. USE THE STAGE</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Try shooting at interactive elements in the stage to create chaotic chain-reactions. Original and over-the-top kills will get a <b>one-liner,</b> which nets you more points than a standard kill.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/500898/files/20140411092646-WOF_reef02_wip.png?1397233606"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b>3. THE TRACTOR RIFLE</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- The 10<sup>th</sup> weapon slot (<b>key number 0</b>) will give you access to a very special tool: <b>the tractor rifle.</b> Click and hold to shoot an energy beam and use it to catch up to 3 enemies. Keep holding and drag them against one of the many death traps in the stage and watch your <b>score</b> and <b>XP bar (experience) </b>rocket!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330187/files/20140126053935-deaths.jpg?1390743575"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 372px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Remember that revenge is nothing without style,</b> so make every kill as splendid as you can. Your performance will be graded when the demo is over. That’s all you need to know, now <b>click through and blast away!</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b></b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Even with all the action it packs,<b> the demo you played is just a tiny part of the whole Will of Flame experience.</b> Aside from the obvious improvements such as tons of new weapons and more polished graphics, here is a quick rundown of all the features we are working on:</p>
<p>- <b>FULLY SCALABLE GAMEPLAY</b> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As you can see in the demo, the <b>gameplay in Will of Flame is scalable by the player at any time</b>. You can limit yourself to a more classic approach and just riddle your enemies with bullets, or you can get
crazy and unleash all kinds of hell on them by combining your weapons, the
stage and the tractor rifle.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">No matter how you play you will always quench your thirst for fast-paced action; but <b>the more you invest in the game, the more you will get in return.</b> Like in the best action movies, your best kills will be rewarded with <b>one-liners,</b> worth extra points. You will also get more XP so you can level up and unlock new tools of destruction.<br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/449913/files/20140321092212-end_level_screen3.png?1395418932"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the end of each level you will see your final score detailed so you can compete with yourself and your friends. There will be emblems to unlock by performing certain feats, and the game will track your stats so you can keep a record of every last one of your over-the-top antics.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our aim is for Will of Flame to have as much replay value as possible to keep you coming back for more insane rampages.</p>
<p>- <b>STORY MODE: 6 exotic locations, </b><b>21</b><b> levels.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Guide the vermillion bounty hunter on an <b>epic quest for revenge.</b> Your home planet has been invaded by monsters, your girl is in danger and your personal ship has been shot down. The responsible for all this is Dr. Kultz, an evil mad scientist. You have no option left but to collect every weapon you can get your hands on, tame the first flying beast that crosses your path and <b>kill your way to revenge through 21 beautiful and dangerous levels.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330215/files/20140126061616-jungle_concept_arthq.jpg?1390745776"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aside from the bottom of the ocean featured in the demo, <b>other areas include a colorful jungle, a rocky desert and an abandoned city.</b> Each of them will contain several thematic levels with their own unique enemies and death traps.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While most missions will consist in disposing of waves upon waves of standard foes in creative ways, we will break the pace every now and then to ensure that things stay fresh. In the final game you will find <b>different enemy classes</b> (like heavies that soak up damage and can’t be dragged around), <b>chase sequences, and other variations</b> such as dark sections that you have to explore with the only light of your own shots.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330217/files/20140126061702-city_concept_temp.jpg?1390745822"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The story will be told through <b>animated comics</b> and will introduce you to an array of loony characters that will help you slowly piece together exactly what is going on.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330222/files/20140126061924-comic_page.jpg?1390745964"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>- <b>INFINITE RUNNER MODE.</b> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you’re feeling more casual, you can leave the story aside and dive into this mode that plays as a suicide mission. You get just one life and are pitted against an infinite supply of enemies in a procedurally generated level that never ends. Make your revenge last for as long as you can and see if you have what it takes to beat the hi-scores. </p>
<p>- <b>GIANT FINAL BOSSES.</b> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because, what kind of an action game would Will of Flame be without some massive bosses to stuff with lead?</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/449957/files/20140321094323-Screenshots_14.jpg?1395420203"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p></p><p>- <b>EPIC SOUNDTRACK.</b> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The soundtrack is a fundamental part of any action game and for that reason we’re making sure to get it right. Rock and electronic tunes will set the rhythm for frenetic bursts of action and will make every one of your choreographies of death feel much more glorious.</p>
<p><b>Check out a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nobleweapon/will-of-flame-reef-rampage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sample</a> of WOF’s soundtrack</b> by the phenomenal David Serrano.</p>
<p>- <b>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION.</b> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Littered across the levels you will find hidden treasures that are worth hundreds of <b>moola</b> (in-game currency). Grab as many as you can and run to the store to spend them on new helmets, hats, hairstyles, goggles and jackets. Amass enough and you’ll be able to purchase exotic mounts to lead to revenge while looking the part.</p>
<p>Will of Flame will not have paid DLC nor will it let players pay real money in the store, just moola.</p>

Will of Flame is a frenetic 2D arcade shoot ‘em up with a scoring system that rewards the most spectacular and original kills. In WOF you control a space bounty hunter riding alien beasts through a planet crawling with aggressive monsters. To achieve the revenge you’re seeking, you will have at your disposal a huge array of weapons, myriads of death traps scattered through the levels and a tractor rifle that lets you pick up enemies and drag them wherever you want. How you combine all three means of destruction is up to you and will determine your final score and the cool stuff you unlock.

We plan on bringing Will of Flame’s hectic action to the screens of Android, iPhone and Windows Phone 8 devices as well as to PC, Mac and Linux. After two years of development, we have come to Indiegogo to enlist you in our commendable
mission. Together we can deliver a modern tribute to the best of 2D gaming from the 90s: the trigger-happy pace and humor of arcade gems like Metal Slug, combined with the charm and originality of Nintendo’s platformers and RPGs. In addition to the fun we will have making and playing Will of Flame, there are some truly awesome perks you can get by being part of this project.

Before saying anything else, we want to let Will of Flame speak for itself. We have prepared a demo for you to get a small taste of what will be included in the full game. Please do take a couple seconds to read the “How to Play” first, keep in mind everything is work in progress, and don’t forget to come back when you’re done playing to hear the rest of what we have in store!
HOW TO PLAY (AVENGING 101):
1. SHOOT AND DODGE
- Use the W,A,S,D keys to move around. Aim and click with the mouse to shoot your enemies.
- Click on the weapon in the HUD or use keys 1-9 to toggle between weapons.
-You can use
an Xbox 360 controller any time you want, just turn it on and use the left
joystick to move, right joystick to aim, RT to shoot and LB and RB to switch weapons.
- Pick up weapon cases to restock ammo, health kits and shields to stay alive, and gold coins just because they’re shiny (in the final game you’ll be able to spend them).
2. USE THE STAGE
- Try shooting at interactive elements in the stage to create chaotic chain-reactions. Original and over-the-top kills will get a one-liner, which nets you more points than a standard kill.
3. THE TRACTOR RIFLE
- The 10th weapon slot (key number 0) will give you access to a very special tool: the tractor rifle. Click and hold to shoot an energy beam and use it to catch up to 3 enemies. Keep holding and drag them against one of the many death traps in the stage and watch your score and XP bar (experience) rocket!

Remember that revenge is nothing without style, so make every kill as splendid as you can. Your performance will be graded when the demo is over. That’s all you need to know, now click through and blast away!


Even with all the action it packs, the demo you played is just a tiny part of the whole Will of Flame experience. Aside from the obvious improvements such as tons of new weapons and more polished graphics, here is a quick rundown of all the features we are working on:
- FULLY SCALABLE GAMEPLAY 
As you can see in the demo, the gameplay in Will of Flame is scalable by the player at any time. You can limit yourself to a more classic approach and just riddle your enemies with bullets, or you can get
crazy and unleash all kinds of hell on them by combining your weapons, the
stage and the tractor rifle.No matter how you play you will always quench your thirst for fast-paced action; but the more you invest in the game, the more you will get in return. Like in the best action movies, your best kills will be rewarded with one-liners, worth extra points. You will also get more XP so you can level up and unlock new tools of destruction.

At the end of each level you will see your final score detailed so you can compete with yourself and your friends. There will be emblems to unlock by performing certain feats, and the game will track your stats so you can keep a record of every last one of your over-the-top antics.
Our aim is for Will of Flame to have as much replay value as possible to keep you coming back for more insane rampages.
- STORY MODE: 6 exotic locations, 21 levels.
Guide the vermillion bounty hunter on an epic quest for revenge. Your home planet has been invaded by monsters, your girl is in danger and your personal ship has been shot down. The responsible for all this is Dr. Kultz, an evil mad scientist. You have no option left but to collect every weapon you can get your hands on, tame the first flying beast that crosses your path and kill your way to revenge through 21 beautiful and dangerous levels.

Aside from the bottom of the ocean featured in the demo, other areas include a colorful jungle, a rocky desert and an abandoned city. Each of them will contain several thematic levels with their own unique enemies and death traps.
While most missions will consist in disposing of waves upon waves of standard foes in creative ways, we will break the pace every now and then to ensure that things stay fresh. In the final game you will find different enemy classes (like heavies that soak up damage and can’t be dragged around), chase sequences, and other variations such as dark sections that you have to explore with the only light of your own shots.

The story will be told through animated comics and will introduce you to an array of loony characters that will help you slowly piece together exactly what is going on.
- INFINITE RUNNER MODE. 
If you’re feeling more casual, you can leave the story aside and dive into this mode that plays as a suicide mission. You get just one life and are pitted against an infinite supply of enemies in a procedurally generated level that never ends. Make your revenge last for as long as you can and see if you have what it takes to beat the hi-scores. 
- GIANT FINAL BOSSES. 
Because, what kind of an action game would Will of Flame be without some massive bosses to stuff with lead?

- EPIC SOUNDTRACK. 
The soundtrack is a fundamental part of any action game and for that reason we’re making sure to get it right. Rock and electronic tunes will set the rhythm for frenetic bursts of action and will make every one of your choreographies of death feel much more glorious.
Check out a sample of WOF’s soundtrack by the phenomenal David Serrano.
- CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION. 
Littered across the levels you will find hidden treasures that are worth hundreds of moola (in-game currency). Grab as many as you can and run to the store to spend them on new helmets, hats, hairstyles, goggles and jackets. Amass enough and you’ll be able to purchase exotic mounts to lead to revenge while looking the part.
Will of Flame will not have paid DLC nor will it let players pay real money in the store, just moola.

- MINIGAMES AND CHEATS. 
We want to give you as many toys and extras to play with as we can, so that you get the biggest bang for your buck. Expect unlockable secrets that will add many hours of silly fun and refreshing changes in the rules.


Emilio is a telecommunications engineer currently working in the industry as a game programmer. At the tender age of 11 he was already building computers in the back of a store in Panama. He’s the architect coding the world of Will of Flame.
Antonio has a bachelor in Advertising and a master’s degree in 3D modeling and animation. He started making games in PowerPoint when he was a kid and later moved on to Flash games and animations. He’s in charge of the artistic side of the game.
Above all, we are two passionate video game enthusiasts who can’t get enough of creating worlds for other gamers to explore, mess around with and, of course, destroy. It is with this goal that we founded Noble Weapon Games and that Will of Flame was born.

We have been developing Will of Flame for more than 2 years while we finished our studies and worked part-time on and off. We have invested a massive amount of time and quite a bit of money in it. Now, after many gameplay prototypes, changing the whole visual style and moving from a custom engine to Unity 3D, we finally feel confident that the project can be completed just how it was always meant to be: perfectly polished and brimming with content in order to bring you the ultimate 2D action fest.
We now have the foundations, most of the tools and the tried-and-true workflow; but, if we want that dream to be realized, we are going to need to work on the game full time for at least 10 months and face much greater development costs. And that’s something we can only afford if you contribute to the cause.
With your help, a year from now, Will of Flame will bring a healthy dose of action to gamers all around the globe and you will be in possession of lots of great perks. 

SO HOW MUCH DOES WILL OF FLAME NEED TO REACH COMPLETION?Below you can see the minimum budget necessary to finish and release Will of Flame in all its glory by Q2 2015
TOTAL BUDGET: €38,000
Design and Animation: €9,800
Development tools and licenses: €4,120 (buying tools and add-ons for Unity 3D, and licenses for Unity Pro, iPhone and Android).Programming: €11,000
Music and Sound FX: €2,200 (15 songs + hundreds of sound effects).
Producing the Perks: €4,561
Legal costs & Reserve funds: €694
Taxes and Indiegogo and Paypal fees: €5,625
STRETCH GOALS
What happens if we get more than the minimum budget? For every €5,000 more than the initial goal, we will port Will of Flame to a new platform, starting with the Wii U and following with the PS4 and Xbox One. In the event that those stretch goals are covered we will use the extra funds to translate Will of Flame to more languages (the game will be originally released in English and Spanish).

There are 3 big ways in which you can help Will of Flame achieve its full potential. It is up to you to decide which options suit you best. Just remember that one option doesn’t exclude another (in fact all 3 are extremely complementary) and that every bit of help counts! 
1. FUNDING THE GAME.
The most obvious way to help is by funding the game. Starting at €5 you will become a fundamental part in the making of this badass action game and you will take home a series of increasingly amazing perks (detailed in the next section).
2. SPREADING THE WORD.
We don’t have a big advertising budget, so we need all the help we can get when it comes to telling the world about Will of Flame.
If, like us, you want to see the game finished, you can help a lot by simply talking to others about it. Anything goes here: tell your family and friends, share the campaign on social networks, feature it on your blog or website, create your own content about it...
We need as many people as we can to watch the campaign video and to play the demo. The more they experience about Will of Flame the more likely they will be to fall in love with it.

Get a special reward using the Indiegogo share tools!
Do you have an Indiegogo account? If not, you can create one and help the project enormously by using IGG’s share tools.
To keep you motivated we will be giving a unique prize to the person who rakes in the most contributions: 2 copies of Will of Flame (PC and mobile device of choice) and an exclusive drawing of the winner as a WOF character.
Downloadable resources.
Aside from the links to the campaign and demo, if you click through this link you will find many more goodies in the form of images and videos of Will of Flame that we encourage you to distribute all over the Internet. We will keep adding more in the upcoming weeks.
3. GIVING US FEEDBACK.
We are always eager to hear your opinions and suggestions. We want you to have a blast with Will of Flame, so please tell us what you like, what you think doesn’t work, what you would love to see... Share all your ideas here at Indiegogo or email us at  nobleweapongames@gmail.com 
Aside from Indiegogo, we will also be in touch through our website, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter to share updates and keep the conversation flowing, so don’t forget to check back often and don’t be shy!
NOTES:
- Most of the art showing the perks is WIP which means the design of some of them will improve vastly before they get to you. We will also hold polls so you can choose which designs you prefer.
- For perks that involve you in the creative process, such as designing items and enemies, the following necessary terms apply: to redeem them you must agree to let us use your idea in the game; we will not accept any offensive content; and we will work with you to make sure that your ideas fit within Will of Flame’s world and gameplay mechanics.
- Delivery times will vary: some perks can’t be delivered until the game is completed, while most will be shipped within the first months of development. We will have more information on this very soon but in the meantime please rest assured that we will send them to you ASAP.- Paypal disclaimer: Paypal requires us to state that we can't give a 100% guarantee of delivery for the rewards. While this is true, we can assure you that short of the untimely death of one of our team members, we will allow nothing to stand between you and your well deserved rewards.
Here’s a list of all the stuff we are preparing for our generous backers:€2: REVENGE SUPPORTER

What platforms will
I be able to play Will of Flame on?
You can expect Will of Flame to be initially available for Android,iPhone,Windows
Phone 8 and standalone platforms like PC, Mac and Linux.
We have also discussed Wii U development as the controls are very suited for the game, but that requires a separate licensing process, just like PS4 and Xbox One, and is therefore one of our stretch goals.

Can I play Will of Flame in my language?
As native Spanish and fluent English speakers, you can expect the game to be in both these languages. However, we would love to translate the game to as many languages as possible (see our stretch goals for more details)
Will I find any DRM in Will of Flame?
We will avoid DRM, except for platforms which have special requirements like Steam.
What about DLC or being able to use real money in the game store?
Will of Flame will come packed with unlockable content from the get go and you will not have to pay extra money for anything. In the store in the game you will only be able to spend moola: in-game currency you collect by playing the levels.
Do you have any other questions?

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>SimStock is a festival management simulator. You get to run your own festival, book bands, build stages, hire food trucks, place bars and sort out broken toilets, what fun! Imagine theme park, but with festivals and you are half way there, but our game is going to be pretty surreal and out there, aided by our good friend Russell Taysom who is adding his trippy visual style to the game.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536959575/tbvkfkes5pz8uxge5pmk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the stage the game is in a pre-alpha build with only minimal assets, mechanics and features. The point of this crowd funder is to raise the money so that we can add all the other bits in that we have dreamt up and make the game a real belter. See below for a road map of the game and it's development milestones.</p>
<p><strong>How you win and how you lose</strong></p>
<p>There are three things to pay attention to in SimStock: Money, people and waste. Each impacts the other, so the more people the more money you have coming in but also the more waste they produce and that will need to be dealt with otherwise people will start leaving.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536959496/gkhnkfpixow0qplgjrmc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You start with a small amount of money and nobody at your festival, start by buying some cheap stages, bars and food trucks and watch the numbers grow but to make real money you need to book a band! Certain bands can go on certain stages and will add a modifier to the stage, increasing the money you earn. Eventually you will need to build some toilets to increase your waste capacity and make sure people aren't disgusted by the state of your festival! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536959542/ro7n4cakmcnfclfhr9c2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you are not careful your festival will start to fall apart and you'll end up with no money and no fans. If it goes well then you will be ready to move on to bigger sites with more complex maps and variations but as it stands, that is where the game ends... see below for what we would <i>like </i>to build into the game with your help!</p>

<p>Most of the funding will go to paying for Russell's time and Nathan's time (our lead developer) as we are in such early stages we can't give a complete breakdown of where funding will be going but as soon as we are at that stage we will release a breakdown document.

We have developed many games for mobile devices, and during these years of development, we always get the same conclusion: if you have a good story to tell, the best way to do it is with a gamebook.And... you know what a gamebook app is, right? A gamebook app is an interactive book in which you decide the course of the story you are reading/playing.We love original gamebooks, but in the case of ""The Awesome Secret of Comic Sans"" the mix between game and book includes a LOT of game.In gamebooks, it's usually the dice which decides who wins the fights, but we prefer to create fight scenes and make YOU fight!We have 2 different fight scenes:
Punch fight. You must punch the enemies without kicking the innocents.
Slide fight (with weapon. Similar to games like Fruit Ninja). You mist slide in order to kick the enemies, and of course, without hurt the innocents.
What we are going to doWe want to make two gamebooks both for ANDROID and IOS devices (iPhone and iPad), explaining the adventures of Guy Brush.

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pub.xenocell.com/boxart_600w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Konrad Kiss, CTO at Bitgap Games"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pub.xenocell.com/konrad128.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-right: 10px;""/>Hi. My name's Konrad Kiss. I'm an indie game developer - 35, living in Hungary, Europe. I have two mischievous kids, a beautiful wife and a weird dog called Paper.</p>
<p>Bitgap Games is my company - created with the aim to develop Xenocell, a massively multiplayer action-strategy game in a sandbox environment for the PC. [Initially for Windows with plans to port over to Linux as resources permit.]</p>
<p>I've been a programmer for over 16 years - creating games since I was 8. My first game to get noticed was called Droidarena in 2000 - it was a browser based strategy game where you had to use a programming language to manage your robot in team based fights within randomly generated arenas.</p>
<p>For the past over four years I've been working with a small team on Xenocell, a sci-fi themed desktop game for the PC that plays in the not so distant future.</p>
<p>The reason why we're here on IndieGoGo is that although Xenocell is nearly ready to go live, we now see that we don't have the required funds to be able to pay for the launch of the game. So we decided to try asking for outside help through IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us secure server resources and launch Xenocell - a huge effort for an independent game company which we are currently not able to undertake.<br/><br/>Please help us, we'd love to show the world how extraordinary Xenocell is!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>More details about the gameplay</h3>
<p>Read more details about the gameplay in a recent <a href=""http://www.videogamesinteractive.com/2012/10/interview-konrad-kiss-on-xenocell-clan.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Xenocell - detailed gameplay mechanics interview"">interview about the game by Video Games Interactive</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Background story</h3>
<p>In the near future, govenrments fight hard to keep their control, but gradually lose to corporations. Before a new world order is born, the United Nations Space Program manages to launch the first interstellar space vessel created by humans - project EDEN.</p>
<p>Upon entering the gravity well of Alpha Centauri's only habitable planet, Ibelis, the ship breaks up in orbit under mysterious circumstances evacuating thousands of life pods towards the planet surface. The game tells the story of the survivors of the U.N.S. EDEN and their search for answers.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>If you like the idea, please let others find us!</h3>
<p>We'd be extremely grateful if you could spread the word about this campaign to your friends. This helps us more that you'd think. If you believe that Xenocell is interesting, please let others know! <span>It is an excellent way for you to show off your support and for others to find out about Xenocell! Just click on any of the sharing tools at the top of the page! Thank you so much! </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>The following is a short description of what we need your help with.</p>
<p><img alt=""Your pledges are used towards: - initial server costs, - changing placeholder art, - getting a contract coder, - publishing and marketing the game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://pub.xenocell.com/expenses.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We estimated initial server and operating costs for two months at a player count where the game becomes able to support itself.</p>
<p>If everything goes according to plan, our third month will be funded by the game itself! Of course, to achieve this, we need to present sufficient server resources so players can enjoy a seamless experience. We also need to make sure that all the placeholder art is changed to final versions of 2D graphics and 3D objects.</p>
<p>To be able to quickly respond to bugs and feature request, we'll need to make sure that during those two months we're able to work on the game almost without interruption - so we'll need an additional programmer who can quickly jump in.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to make sure that we get the word out - so we'll get in touch with game magazines (we actually already got started with that!) and contact publishers like Steam (Greenlight), Desura and GoG, so we can get started with working on implementing their APIs.</p>
<p>Since we don't see the launch happen unless we reach our goal, we only take your pledges if we reach the target sum of $20K.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Do I get a downloadable copy of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! Actually, everyone does! We are planning to make the game freely available to download for everyone. However, certain parts of the game are only available to VIP members. Things like being able to use higher quality items, or being able to start a clan. Most of our perks include VIP membership plans from a single month to a lifetime membership.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What does it mean to be a VIP member?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Being a VIP member means that you can access every feature of the game. You are either a FREE or a VIP member. FREE members can play as well, but they won't be able to ie. start a clan.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do I become a VIP member?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> To become a VIP member, you can either pay monthly for a subscription, or you can use an in-game item called a VIP ticket, which will turn the player's account into a VIP account for an entire month. The great thing about tickets is that you can give them to other players or you can trade them for other in-game valuables.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do players need to subscribe? Why not charge only once for the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In contrast to traditional games, most massively multiplayer games like Xenocell need to support a huge number of servers to keep the game world active even while you are not playing. So, in Xenocell, when you close the game, the rest of the world lives on! When you log in again the next day, it is possible that you will have a new neighbor or see signs of an attack against your base.</p>
<p>This requires plenty of computers - resources that we need to pay for every month. We also believe that having to pay a few dollars each month as long as you play the game to its full or for free with minor limitations is fair and allows everyone to try the game without first buying it. If you don't want to play for a few months, you can just suspend your subscription or not use your VIP tickets - you can change back to playing for free at any time!</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the price of a VIP subscription for a month?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It's 400 store Points or $7.95 when you subscribe monthly. 400 Points cost from $4.57 (when you buy more Points) to $9.95 (when you buy exactly 400 Points). A great aspect of points is that you can spend them on several things in-game. Few items have a price both in Credits (in-game fictional currency) and Points (store currency you can buy for real money). We paid attention to being very careful about what items are available for Points in-game to not affect game balance.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will the client support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It will support all Windows versions since Vista.</p>
<p><strong>Q: If you get a liftime V.I.P membership via donation, does that make the game free but with VIP access, for as long I want?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes! The lifetime option will make your account VIP - so you can access the game in full without having to either spend your store Points or subscribe for a few dollars a month. Please see the FAQ questions above for details about VIP access and Point values. To give you an even better idea, visit this page: <a href=""http://www.xenocell.com/store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Xenocell store (work-in-progress)"">http://www.xenocell.com/store/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What hardware demands does the game have?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are still working on optimizing the game's performance and we've used older hardware for development and testing to see performance issues right away. We don't have the final specs yet, but the bottleneck will definitely be the graphics card. It currently runs great on an ATI Radeon 5770 card which according to <a href=""http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""VideoBenchmark.net"">http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/</a> is a bit weaker than an average card today.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Only online mode?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the entire game is persistent, always online - like MMOs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if you spend time and “money” on building stuff and needs to go away for some time. Will there be any way of protecting that from simply being blown away when you come back online later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> As long as your items are not destroyed you can always deconstruct anything you built back into a convenient inventory item. Deconstruction takes time and resets if you are interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is the game balanced for one player or group dynamics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> My goal was to allow single person groups to exist. By being able to build NPC defences, turrets and a host of other defensive options, a well-protected one player group will be just as hard to beat as an entire clan. However, attacking another clan will be very hard to do alone. The game helps a lot with defense, but little with offense.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is this game on a single shard server?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, for now. We predict that it is able to host tens of thousands of players, perhaps even hundreds of thousands. We are able to clone a new shard in a day, however.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens to avatar and/or equipment when offline?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Your avatar and your avatar's inventory disappear from the world just like in any other persistent online game. Your structures that you built and your hired mercenaries however stay where you place them and do their job. Mine minerals, defend your buildings, trade with your allies, etc...</p>

</div></div>","Hi. My name's Konrad Kiss. I'm an indie game developer - 35, living in Hungary, Europe. I have two mischievous kids, a beautiful wife and a weird dog called Paper.
Bitgap Games is my company - created with the aim to develop Xenocell, a massively multiplayer action-strategy game in a sandbox environment for the PC. [Initially for Windows with plans to port over to Linux as resources permit.]
I've been a programmer for over 16 years - creating games since I was 8. My first game to get noticed was called Droidarena in 2000 - it was a browser based strategy game where you had to use a programming language to manage your robot in team based fights within randomly generated arenas.
For the past over four years I've been working with a small team on Xenocell, a sci-fi themed desktop game for the PC that plays in the not so distant future.
The reason why we're here on IndieGoGo is that although Xenocell is nearly ready to go live, we now see that we don't have the required funds to be able to pay for the launch of the game. So we decided to try asking for outside help through IndieGoGo.
Your contributions will help us secure server resources and launch Xenocell - a huge effort for an independent game company which we are currently not able to undertake.Please help us, we'd love to show the world how extraordinary Xenocell is!
 
More details about the gameplay
Read more details about the gameplay in a recent interview about the game by Video Games Interactive.
 


Background story
In the near future, govenrments fight hard to keep their control, but gradually lose to corporations. Before a new world order is born, the United Nations Space Program manages to launch the first interstellar space vessel created by humans - project EDEN.
Upon entering the gravity well of Alpha Centauri's only habitable planet, Ibelis, the ship breaks up in orbit under mysterious circumstances evacuating thousands of life pods towards the planet surface. The game tells the story of the survivors of the U.N.S. EDEN and their search for answers.
 
If you like the idea, please let others find us!
We'd be extremely grateful if you could spread the word about this campaign to your friends. This helps us more that you'd think. If you believe that Xenocell is interesting, please let others know! It is an excellent way for you to show off your support and for others to find out about Xenocell! Just click on any of the sharing tools at the top of the page! Thank you so much! 
 
What we need
The following is a short description of what we need your help with.

We estimated initial server and operating costs for two months at a player count where the game becomes able to support itself.
If everything goes according to plan, our third month will be funded by the game itself! Of course, to achieve this, we need to present sufficient server resources so players can enjoy a seamless experience. We also need to make sure that all the placeholder art is changed to final versions of 2D graphics and 3D objects.
To be able to quickly respond to bugs and feature request, we'll need to make sure that during those two months we're able to work on the game almost without interruption - so we'll need an additional programmer who can quickly jump in.
Finally, we need to make sure that we get the word out - so we'll get in touch with game magazines (we actually already got started with that!) and contact publishers like Steam (Greenlight), Desura and GoG, so we can get started with working on implementing their APIs.
Since we don't see the launch happen unless we reach our goal, we only take your pledges if we reach the target sum of $20K.

</p><h4>Imagine a game like a fable where you decide
how the story goes…</h4>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Welcome to our crowdfunding campaign for <i>The
Tale of Three</i>, which is a third-person perspective video game with three playable
characters whose fates get tangled up with each other.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you haven't already seen the trailer, don't wait anymore – you must see it! The video contains actual
in-game footage from the pre-alpha version. We realize that it looks pretty raw
without some assets, textures, or parts of gameplay but keep in mind that it's the beginning of the development and in the end it will look much better.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848519/files/20140910180526-TheTaleOfThree_01.png?1410397526"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our goal is to create a game like a fable, which will allow
you to take part in an epic adventure with unforgettable characters in the mysterious world, and where on your choices will depend how the story goes. We hope that it will stand out by its original gameplay and
high level of difficulty – like in old good games, but with a modern twist.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Among the inspirations we have to mention
tales from our childhood like those by the Brothers Grimm, Hans
Christian Andersen, Charles Perrault, and many, many others. When it comes to
games, we take pattern from <i>Hype: The Time Quest </i>(it's quite old but still
charming), <i>Fable: The Lost Chapters</i>, and <i>Prince of Persia</i>.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">So what we want to achieve is to create
something that will make us feel the same magic we felt when our mothers
and fathers read us stories in childhood, and then when we played games as
teenagers. Sometimes contemporary productions look pretty but finishing them no
longer makes such pleasure like in the old ones. We would like to return to the
roots, drawn from the DNA of classics and make for you something that you will
want to play again.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848287/files/20140910153316-WhoAreWe.png?1410388396"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Main features of the game in case of reaching
the campaign goal:</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Almost every mission can be completed in
multiple ways.</b> You
decide whether to accomplish it craftily, truculently, or maybe you can find a happy
medium. You can sneak around or go all out, hide or attack. The choice is yours.<br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Each of three playable characters
has its unique skills</b>
that are inestimable useful in combat. You can fight using melee and ranged weapons
and also magical powers.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Use the environment!</b> Due to the physics a lot of objects can
be moved and destroyed but also used against the opponents.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Compete against different enemies:
</b>wild animals,
skeletons, bandits, angry gnomes, and many, many others as well as bosses whose defeat require use of fancy methods. But remember that every opponent is different so each requires different tactics.<br/>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Get ready to explore the magical world</b> (also on a horseback) covering
approx. 10 square km (4 square miles) including undergrounds. Visit medieval city, enchanted forest, village of elves, ruins, dark woods, swamps,
caves, etc., and also have some fun in the tavern, take a trip through the
gnome mines, and sneak around the castle.</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Be ready for the high level of difficulty</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, planning next move, solving puzzles, and making quick decisions that cannot be taken back.</span>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b>Discover the dynamic world that is
alive </b>with day/night
cycle and weather. Meet a whole host of animals (e.g. wolfs, bears, cats,
cows, birds) and the magical creatures (yes, dragons too!).</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The Tale of Three</i> will be an action-adventure game with platform elements, but we won't hold your hand throughout
the story. There will be a lot to discover but nothing will be given on a
plate. We focus on a maximum immersion and high level of difficulty like in the
old-school games.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848524/files/20140910180714-TheTaleOfThree_06.png?1410397634"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847659/files/20140910111115-HowBigIsItGoingToBe.png?1410372675"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It's hard to assess it now, but don't
expect that <i>The Tale of Three</i> will be as big as<i> </i>AAA titles because these games were created by dozens of people for many years and their
production cost millions of dollars. We are only two and so far our budget is made
up of our savings, which slowly come to an end.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus <i>The Tale of Three</i> is going to be a
smaller indie game, which would resemble a fable. Not an RPG but an action-adventure game with wonderful story that depends on your choices. No open-world but freedom in large locations.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">However, if we would be able
to collect money we need, it is possible that we will extend the original
concept by adding some more stuff…</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847670/files/20140910111307-Technology.png?1410372787"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As we mentioned, we are using Unreal Engine which is a wonderful tool for game development. It powers such titles as <i>BioShock, Splinter Cell, Batman, Borderlands, Thief, Fable Legends, Gears of War, Mass Effect</i> and
much more. The newest version of this engine allows us to build a detailed world with a day/night
cycle, weather events and without loading screens.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also we are using SpeedTree to create
stunning plants as well as Mixamo to animate characters and animals.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847661/files/20140910111137-ForumAndEarlyAccess.png?1410372697"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are going to run a forum for funders where you
will be able to share with us your opinions, suggestions, and thoughts about <i>The Tale of Three</i>. It's extremely important for us to stay in touch with you
so we could create the game that meets your needs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For this reason, we will release the alpha version
in late spring 2015 for all funders up from the Alpha Version tier, and then
the beta version for all up from the Beta Version tier. We would like to give
you an opportunity to participate in the development :)</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848448/files/20140910165103-TheTaleOfThree_03.png?1410393063"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have never created a game before so first
we wanted to make sure that we will be able to provide you a solid product.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over a year ago we started to explore the
possibilities and learn everything about game development. The first engine,
which we used, was good and thanks to it we learned the basics but we wanted
something more. Then, in the first quarter of this year, we decided to move to
Unreal Engine 4. We started again and in the last three months we have created
the pre-alpha version that you can see in the video above.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/847673/files/20140910111327-WhyAreWeAskingYou.png?1410372807"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>First of all, because we have to pay for some really
expensive programs, updates and assets that are necessary to create an
up-to-date game including SpeedTree for beautiful grass and other plants, and
Mixamo for realistic animations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because we would be able to hire a few people
who offered us their help. After all they will not work for free so we would
be able to pay them wages.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because we need to update some of our equipment
in order to better optimize it for game development. We have to buy a new computer with the powerful graphics card because Unreal Editor needs a high performance hardware.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And last but not least, as for now we finance
the game with our own savings that are running out. We work from home to
minimize costs but we have to pay the rent, bills, taxes and other
administrative costs. Also we must eat ;)</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/848455/files/20140910170441-TheTaleOfThree_05.png?1410393881"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Combining it all together and adding the costs
for the development and the perks, the budged set for this campaign is the
total minimum. We chose ""fixed funding"" so if we do not reach our goal, <i>The
Tale of Three</i> will most probably not be made because we will be forced to go to work and we will not have time to make it. Simply, it’s all or
nothing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But on the other hand, if we exceed the minimum
goal, we will be able to create for you much more! We could port game to
GNU/Linux and Mac, and add more characters, locations and missions.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/845563/files/20140909124739-PerksAndRewards.png?1410292059"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

If you are reading this, I suppose that The
Tale of Three got your attention, didn't it? And if you want to make this game
happen – just contribute! But if something prevents you from that, please
answer two simple questions: What is that? And what should I do to resolve
your doubts?
It seems that many people have objections and I
would like to help them. But I cannot do it without feedback :( It will take
you a minute to answer my questions, so please leave a comment here or on
Facebook or email me directly: matthew@gamednastudio.com.
I really need your even the smallest involvement :)
If the problem is that you don't believe that
we can create this game, take a look at the video. Two people created this in
about three months. Throughout the year we will be able to do much more. We

it. It's our dream and we want it to come true!
If you doubt because of the total amount of contributions
so far, don't think about it ;) Game like The Tale of Three can be funded
within hours or days. If everyone will make a contribution without thinking, ""I
would help them but I'm afraid they won't make it"", we will reach our goal
quickly. We can create The Tale of Three and we will do everything to create it!
So don't hesitate, get on board, and together we can make it become a reality
:)

Imagine a game like a fable where you decide
how the story goes…
Welcome to our crowdfunding campaign for The
Tale of Three, which is a third-person perspective video game with three playable
characters whose fates get tangled up with each other.
If you haven't already seen the trailer, don't wait anymore – you must see it! The video contains actual
in-game footage from the pre-alpha version. We realize that it looks pretty raw
without some assets, textures, or parts of gameplay but keep in mind that it's the beginning of the development and in the end it will look much better.Our goal is to create a game like a fable, which will allow
you to take part in an epic adventure with unforgettable characters in the mysterious world, and where on your choices will depend how the story goes. We hope that it will stand out by its original gameplay and
high level of difficulty – like in old good games, but with a modern twist.Among the inspirations we have to mention
tales from our childhood like those by the Brothers Grimm, Hans
Christian Andersen, Charles Perrault, and many, many others. When it comes to
games, we take pattern from Hype: The Time Quest (it's quite old but still
charming), Fable: The Lost Chapters, and Prince of Persia.So what we want to achieve is to create
something that will make us feel the same magic we felt when our mothers
and fathers read us stories in childhood, and then when we played games as
teenagers. Sometimes contemporary productions look pretty but finishing them no
longer makes such pleasure like in the old ones. We would like to return to the
roots, drawn from the DNA of classics and make for you something that you will
want to play again.
We are friends whose love for games leaded to set up gameDNA studio, which so far is two-person indie game development team.






I've loved programming since I was a
kid, so today I'm a software engineer with a degree obtained at the Warsaw
University of Technology. In gameDNA studio I'm a Gameplay and AI Programmer responsible for all the technical issues (including programming in
C++).








I've always loved art, so in our
game I'm responsible for writing the script and creating all visual
aspects of it including the whole world. I've already finished studies at
the University of Warsaw and I have a bachelor of arts degree.




We have spent plenty of time playing games and we have always dreamt of creating them, so about a
year and half ago we started to be more serious about this. At first, we were a
little scared but when we started developing… we fell in love with it from the
first sight! Sure, it's not easy but it gives us great pleasure and
satisfaction. It's some kind of labor of love. We really believe in The Tale
of Three and we hope that we're not the only ones :)

If you want to ask us about something or you
have suggestions, we'd love to hear from you at: patrick@gamednastudio.com
and/or matthew@gamednastudio.com. Don't be shy and feel free to write to us :)
We promise that we will do everything to respond to all of you.



Beginner thief with
magical powers, overgrown and extremely strong gnome, and smart elf with
the powerful bow. Three heroes whose fates are suddenly tangled up with each
other and lust for wealth leads to the one… But will they find what they expect at the end of the journey?
Well, the answer to this question you will obtain when you finish the game. But first you need to explore the magical world, defeat hundreds of enemies, discover pieces of the puzzle story
and make decisions on which everything will depend. The great adventure is waiting
for you!The heroes appear in turns during the story so you will have an incredible opportunity to look at some events from the different perspective.

Main features of the game in case of reaching
the campaign goal:


Almost every mission can be completed in
multiple ways. You
decide whether to accomplish it craftily, truculently, or maybe you can find a happy
medium. You can sneak around or go all out, hide or attack. The choice is yours.


Each of three playable characters
has its unique skills
that are inestimable useful in combat. You can fight using melee and ranged weapons
and also magical powers.

Use the environment! Due to the physics a lot of objects can
be moved and destroyed but also used against the opponents.

Compete against different enemies:
wild animals,
skeletons, bandits, angry gnomes, and many, many others as well as bosses whose defeat require use of fancy methods. But remember that every opponent is different so each requires different tactics.


Get ready to explore the magical world (also on a horseback) covering
approx. 10 square km (4 square miles) including undergrounds. Visit medieval city, enchanted forest, village of elves, ruins, dark woods, swamps,
caves, etc., and also have some fun in the tavern, take a trip through the
gnome mines, and sneak around the castle.

Be ready for the high level of difficulty, planning next move, solving puzzles, and making quick decisions that cannot be taken back.


Discover the dynamic world that is
alive with day/night
cycle and weather. Meet a whole host of animals (e.g. wolfs, bears, cats,
cows, birds) and the magical creatures (yes, dragons too!).


The Tale of Three will be an action-adventure game with platform elements, but we won't hold your hand throughout
the story. There will be a lot to discover but nothing will be given on a
plate. We focus on a maximum immersion and high level of difficulty like in the
old-school games.
It's hard to assess it now, but don't
expect that The Tale of Three will be as big as AAA titles because these games were created by dozens of people for many years and their
production cost millions of dollars. We are only two and so far our budget is made
up of our savings, which slowly come to an end.
Thus The Tale of Three is going to be a
smaller indie game, which would resemble a fable. Not an RPG but an action-adventure game with wonderful story that depends on your choices. No open-world but freedom in large locations.However, if we would be able
to collect money we need, it is possible that we will extend the original
concept by adding some more stuff…
As we mentioned, we are using Unreal Engine which is a wonderful tool for game development. It powers such titles as BioShock, Splinter Cell, Batman, Borderlands, Thief, Fable Legends, Gears of War, Mass Effect and
much more. The newest version of this engine allows us to build a detailed world with a day/night
cycle, weather events and without loading screens.
Also we are using SpeedTree to create
stunning plants as well as Mixamo to animate characters and animals.
We are going to run a forum for funders where you
will be able to share with us your opinions, suggestions, and thoughts about The Tale of Three. It's extremely important for us to stay in touch with you
so we could create the game that meets your needs.
For this reason, we will release the alpha version
in late spring 2015 for all funders up from the Alpha Version tier, and then
the beta version for all up from the Beta Version tier. We would like to give
you an opportunity to participate in the development :)


We have never created a game before so first
we wanted to make sure that we will be able to provide you a solid product.
Over a year ago we started to explore the
possibilities and learn everything about game development. The first engine,
which we used, was good and thanks to it we learned the basics but we wanted
something more. Then, in the first quarter of this year, we decided to move to
Unreal Engine 4. We started again and in the last three months we have created
the pre-alpha version that you can see in the video above.

First of all, because we have to pay for some really
expensive programs, updates and assets that are necessary to create an
up-to-date game including SpeedTree for beautiful grass and other plants, and
Mixamo for realistic animations.
Because we would be able to hire a few people
who offered us their help. After all they will not work for free so we would
be able to pay them wages.
Because we need to update some of our equipment
in order to better optimize it for game development. We have to buy a new computer with the powerful graphics card because Unreal Editor needs a high performance hardware.
And last but not least, as for now we finance
the game with our own savings that are running out. We work from home to
minimize costs but we have to pay the rent, bills, taxes and other
administrative costs. Also we must eat ;)
Combining it all together and adding the costs
for the development and the perks, the budged set for this campaign is the
total minimum. We chose ""fixed funding"" so if we do not reach our goal, The
Tale of Three will most probably not be made because we will be forced to go to work and we will not have time to make it. Simply, it’s all or
nothing.
But on the other hand, if we exceed the minimum
goal, we will be able to create for you much more! We could port game to
GNU/Linux and Mac, and add more characters, locations and missions.

As a player you take the role of a mercenary who works contract missions for various corporations operating in the solar system.Four mission playable prototype on Steam and on our website. Test it out for yourself.https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190690/IOX/https://ioxiangames.com/downloads/ ITEM PROGRESSIONCurrently in the playable demo the item progression is just the foundation for us to build and experiment upon. Our planned item progression will have several features that let you customize how your gear work as well as provide scaling to allow you to tackle harder challenges once you have enough resources. AugmentationItems will have upgradeable stats to improve it for greater challenges. Usually it is more resource beneficial to try to find a similar item with better stats from a mission than trying to upgrade one from junk to god tier. If you are really keen on using the same item from the start to the finish you can do so.Most items in the game will have slots for you to attach augments into them, modifying the base behavior of the item or provide various other effects. Augments can be attached freely but detached with a small cost and they will have their own internal stats that can be upgraded with resources.Items can be sealed to give them the final boost of power. Once sealed the item can no longer be modified or it's augments removed. Sealing an item gives an option to choose a powerful extra modifier that can not be gained in any other way. During mid-game it can be useful to use some sealed items just for the additional power they provide, while keeping on improving similar non-sealed versions for the endgame.CosmeticsPlayers will have the ability to modify the look of the items they find as well as their effects. When you disassemble an item you will gain the ability to make any other same class item to look like the one you destroyed, both in the inventory as well as on the characters hands. For weapon and skill effects the players will have the capability to change the color, sound and particle effects to a certain degree of the item. This has no gameplay effect, but as we all know; victory means nothing if you don't look good while doing it. TALENTSAs you progress through the missions and level up you will unlock talent points that you can spend to modify your character's playstyle. Talents are usually the factor that dictates what kind of equipment your character will use as even tho some talents give extra power in a straightforward manner, their biggest strength come from synergistic combinations. Talent points can be redeemed at a price, so if you feel like you selected a bad talent point or feel like trying something new you can respec some of your points easily. Respeccing entire characters will be costly tho so if you are planning a new build it is usually better to level up a new character for that rather than paying to redeem all talent points. MISSIONSAll the missions in IOX will be handcrafted and will provide unique challenges and features. Players can choose to play missions in the order they like, so when you feel like you are ready for bigger challenges you can do so right away without having to grind through non-challenging content.Missions will have variations and features that get randomized every time you finish up a previous mission.

Even though that we actually got a lot of donations from you, (big thanks for them), it looks like that we won't be able to receive them due to some paypal issues. Donations are, for some reason, returned to the donator as soon as he makes the contribution. We are trying to solve the problem with the indiegogo staff, but we think that the solution won't be find. Once again, thanks a lot to everyone who donated.

<p>First of all, take a look at the video presented above, it doesn't last for too long! =)</p>
<p>Also, thanks for taking a look at our first <em>Indiegogo</em> campaign! We are very happy to have such a professional way to present your our project and ideas which will hopefully be recognized and supported by You!</p>
<p>My name is Igor ""D2P.Nexus"" Dudjak and I am the founder of Dota 2 Portal, one of the nicest Dota 2 communities on the Internet. From the moment I started playing this awesome game, I got hooked to it. Its interesting team-based gameplay creates a wonderful atmosphere for you and your friends to play. In my case, it was the love on the first sight.</p>
<p>In order to give something back to this nice game, I've created a Youtube channel and got an idea to combine the 3 things that I love the most - Dota, Video Editing and Music. After discussing it with some of my close friends, I created the first episode 3 weeks ago..</p>
<p>From the moment the show was uploaded and presented to the community, I've received a lot of positive feedback from the people saying that the ""Dota 2 Lore"" is one of the nicest Dota 2 shows at the moment. I was really happy and amazed by the reactions, even though our first episode was presented as a beta - testing of the show.</p>
<p>I would really like to continue creating these videos, but sadly, there are some huge problems that could lead to the complete shut down. That's why I am here, to seek out the help from you guys! Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Before I proceed to the details of the campaign, I would like to present you some details regarding the ""Dota 2 Lore"". Hopefully, this will show you that our project is really one of the most promising Dota 2 projects right now!</p>
<p>Our Youtube channel is 1 year old. First video that was uploaded has around 1200 likes at the moment - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvCc5lml-os&amp;list=PL5F2F51DE7BF4A1BC&amp;index=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Link"">Link</a>, which is amazing. But this fact could blow your mind - our first testing episode for our new show, that was uploaded only 3 weeks ago, has already received over 1100 likes! I can't express how happy I was after I saw the comments from the community, so I have to copy paste some of them here!</p>

<p><strong>The problem is following: </strong>This show has to be recorded with some really good hardware. I am currently lending a camera from my friend in order to record in the HD resolution. Furthermore, scenes that I record are usually placed in the project folders that are often larger than 70-80 GB, for 10 min episodes.</p>
<p>My computer can't handle those numbers for a long time, without crashing my software at least 10-15 times during the editing process. What's even worse, once I finally edit the transitions and the scenes, I have to render the project. This rendering process takes around 6-8 hours for each episode, but only if the program doesn't crash during the rendering. If it does, I have to start over, what's really, really time consuming.</p>
<p>The only solution is to get a better computer and the equipment, but I won't have the necessary money for it in the both near and the far future. Currently, all the income I get is going to my College budget - appartment, bills, food, transportation and similar stuff..</p>
<p><strong>Why 5000$?</strong></p>
<p>Some of you could ask these kind of questions, so I would like to answer them right now. I am aware that the sum could be rather large at the first sight. But once you take into the consideration the taxes from IGG (indiegogo and PayPal), final sum won't be 5000$. The equipment we need for this project isn't cheap, as many of you already know. :) Even if we don't reach the final goal, what would be amazing, feel assured that we will use whatever we get in the best way! Of course, we will keep you informed of the things that we got, or might even ask for your help to point us to the best equipment!</p>
<p>Money raised over this campaign would be used for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would buy a new computer, along with the 2 monitors that are ""must have"" for the professional video editing. - (1500 - 2000$)</li>
<li>I would buy an HD camera before I break the camera of my friend. - (1000$)</li>
<li>I would probably buy the professional drawing tablet, just to try out some stuff and hopefully bring the show to the next level. - (800 - 1000$)</li>
<li>Rest of the money would go towards the show promotion on the various places.</li>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>Greetings. Our names are Colton White and Matt Turnbull. We have been working together for the past two years and have done a lot of gaming in that time. A while ago we set out to create a game of our own. After a few weeks of work we had a rough outline of what would later become Mayhem Mines.</p>
<p>When designing Mayhem Mines we had one goal; create a fast paced game that is hilarious and extremely fun to play. We encourage you to watch our video to learn more about the game, but in short, Mayhem Mines puts you in the shoes of a dwarf mining for treasure.</p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time designing and playing this game and we are in love with it but now we need your help. We both share the dream of having a game that we designed printed professionally and in the hands of other gamers. This is where you come in.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>After getting quotes from a few different game manufacturers and shipping centers for worldwide shipping. We have determined that to not only have our game printed, but also deliver wonderful perks to our amazing backers, we need $15,000.  </p>
<p>The best of our campaign is that we have factored in shipping for all backers! That's right, what you see is what you pay. </p>

<h3>Why it's important.</h3>
<p>This is essentially a story about mental illness, and I feel it's a subject that is too often shied away from in polite discourse. I think there are a lot of conversation to be had on this subject, and it's sad to see a problem that almost half of adult suffer with at some point in their lives, being treated like it's something rare and unusual, and the people who suffer with the problems being perceived as broken or defective. I just want to start the conversation. I'm an older person (40 years) and with my graphic design background I have a couple of decades experience managing and completing long term projects. I've gotten it this far by myself, and while I could toil in anonymity to finish, I want to bring it to market faster and with a higher profile, and you can help with this</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The story</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Ahrens, the creator, is disappointed by the race of the world he created … humanity. Mankind lives in hate, greed and rage. There is no peace in this world. Most of the wars find their origin in racism and religious differences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469390710/qs01jq7jeutlsppojcyt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These incidents led Ahrens to decide to redeem humankind, by taking their physical and mental differences. He deprived them of their souls, the echoz, and concluded their lifeless vessels into guardians. Ahrens sent the guardians to different areas and even worlds. These worlds can only be entered by gates: the Gates of Ahrens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469390822/ufybcyuyfora8dbss2x1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To protect the balance of his creatings Ahrens designed the keepers. They pursue the purpose of observing the guardians and mundits, the emotionless vessels of the former human.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469390861/ks9kvzbzvvbtazzzmolo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>100 year of peace have passed, when one keeper, named Buckles, decided to give the echoz back to humanity. In his eyes the redemption was a big mistake and he was preparing to destroy the guardians. He was searching for a mundit child, because the souls of children are the purest. Buckles tried to reconvert it into a human, which didn't succeed perfectly. The result was a little fellow named Opus, with whom he connected immediately. And thus both prepared for their adventure to oppose the sake of Ahrens and rescue the human echoz.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469390907/fqlrq1ycdsa1gwiobsey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>About the game</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our game is of the action-adventure genre and is modeled on the traditional game principle. With the task to free the human echoz you will immerse into different worlds. These worlds differ in surroundings as well as in enemies. The dungeons you have to pass are matched with the surroundings too.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>There are different classes of enemies like phantoms or guardians. From them you will obtain new skills, which you will need to defeat new opponents or to navigate your way through the given scenario.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469391030/rsxhfzdbr0f372g33c7g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Opus, which you are able to play in the demo is not the only available character. Later you will get another impression of the story from the point of view of another person.

</div></div>","Project ECHOZ is an action-adventure game, where the player is taking over the role of little Opus, who, with his companion, has to master the seemingly simplest task of the world … saving mankind.He has to destroy the cursed phantoms and guardians to free the human echoz. But saving mankind can be interpreted in many ways, which happens to be the case with Salus, Opus' opponent. Salus wants to stop him at any cost, because according to him Opus will destroy mankind rather than save it. In the end faith will determine who's superior...
 
You can download our demo version here:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ia9tth6rf23roob/Project%20Echoz-Demo.zip?dl=0
 
 
The story
 
Ahrens, the creator, is disappointed by the race of the world he created … humanity. Mankind lives in hate, greed and rage. There is no peace in this world. Most of the wars find their origin in racism and religious differences.
 

 
These incidents led Ahrens to decide to redeem humankind, by taking their physical and mental differences. He deprived them of their souls, the echoz, and concluded their lifeless vessels into guardians. Ahrens sent the guardians to different areas and even worlds. These worlds can only be entered by gates: the Gates of Ahrens.
 

 
To protect the balance of his creatings Ahrens designed the keepers. They pursue the purpose of observing the guardians and mundits, the emotionless vessels of the former human.
 

 
100 year of peace have passed, when one keeper, named Buckles, decided to give the echoz back to humanity. In his eyes the redemption was a big mistake and he was preparing to destroy the guardians. He was searching for a mundit child, because the souls of children are the purest. Buckles tried to reconvert it into a human, which didn't succeed perfectly. The result was a little fellow named Opus, with whom he connected immediately. And thus both prepared for their adventure to oppose the sake of Ahrens and rescue the human echoz.
 

 
 
About the game
 
Our game is of the action-adventure genre and is modeled on the traditional game principle. With the task to free the human echoz you will immerse into different worlds. These worlds differ in surroundings as well as in enemies. The dungeons you have to pass are matched with the surroundings too.
 

 
There are different classes of enemies like phantoms or guardians. From them you will obtain new skills, which you will need to defeat new opponents or to navigate your way through the given scenario.

 
Opus, which you are able to play in the demo is not the only available character. Later you will get another impression of the story from the point of view of another person. Depending on the decisions you make during the gameplay the ending might vary and it is up to you on whose side you will end up!
 

 
 





 
 
About us
 
We place high value on the atmosphere and are eager to emphasize it with a appropriate soundtrack and imaginative noises.
 

 
But we need your support to be able to afford adequate equipment and to offer you an even better quality! We will also be able to enlarge our team and thus have the capacity to achieve more in the same time span.
 

 
When we have started developing this game we would have never imagined it would become such a great project. We are really proud of the soundtrack and the atmosphere, and especially of the beautifully set light effects. Sadly we haven't had the time we wanted to invest, due to our jobs and/or studies at the university. But nonetheless since October 2015 we focused on doing our best. Now we proudly present to you our demo version and we hope you like it! We would be very thankful if you could support us.

<p>We are a two-people debutant team from Cracow, Poland - <strong>Marcin Tomala &amp; Anna Siejka</strong>. We have been working on Indie Game Developement as hobby so far, having finished Mobile Games and Unity Asset Store products in our free time. Finaly we have decided to make the great step and fulfill our dream of creating a full-fledged Indie Game you see now!</p>
<p>Marcin is a Unity game developer with previous releases in Game Dev and ~6 years of experience with Unity environment and supportive software. Anna is an aspiring 3D Graphic Artist with passion to all that involves creativity and colour.</p>
<p>This game is the result of our common dream - to create a beautiful and memorable indie game to shine both visually and in gameplay. We are doing our best to achieve this goal and considering our team size - it is an epic challenge that we are more than glad to stand to!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498762651/ptnujcyuo15tcx6m7vb3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because we are a small, focused team, we wish on bringing you the best experience we dreamed of for Redum Of Sun. We don't want to sacrifice the quality of the core gameplay and feeling by placing our worktime somewhere else. We have some cool ideas for Stretch Goals, like Mac/Console ports, more language versions, more environments, or hiring Marketing Specialist so we can work more on the game itself, but we want to look objectively on what we can do in a given time. That's why we are focusing on bringing you a great game first, and accessory features second. Still, if optimistically we pierce the Main Goal with enough of your supportive power, Stretch Goals could appear in the future!</p>

The game focuses on Archery and Magic combat to bring down whole squads of foes with epic boss battles in the forests, mountains, ruins and plains of the Homeworld of the Sun Demigodess.
 
  
Archery becomes Art in Redum Of Sun!
By bringing down Moon Sentinels and Bosses you gain their Ichor - the God Blood - to fuel your character's progress. Use it to gain powerful abilities, new arrows and divine magic to amplify your combat style, or craft useful items to aid you in dire moments - it's Dark Souls school of self-adjusting, currency-driven difficulty!


 
Fluid and intense archery & spell combat with rewarding character progression. Your weapon will become part of your soul.

Unique enemy and character designs, focused on the Divine and Exotic. Do not expect to see any mundane faces in these Celestial Lands - No mortal had ever been here before!

Breath-taking locations and vistas to explore. The open world of the unknown awaits to be discovered!

 
Old-school epic boss battles. there is no place for cowards in the Realm of Sun - only Glory for the victors!
 
Gain Ichor from foes you defeat to unlock divine abilities, tailoring and enhancing your own playstyle!
 
Unfold the truth of how the world came into existence. Collect pieces of mythos scattered in the farthest corners of the homeland of Sun
 


""Two people focused on blending the beautiful and the badass in a single experience!""
We are a two-people debutant team from Cracow, Poland - Marcin Tomala & Anna Siejka. We have been working on Indie Game Developement as hobby so far, having finished Mobile Games and Unity Asset Store products in our free time. Finaly we have decided to make the great step and fulfill our dream of creating a full-fledged Indie Game you see now!
Marcin is a Unity game developer with previous releases in Game Dev and ~6 years of experience with Unity environment and supportive software. Anna is an aspiring 3D Graphic Artist with passion to all that involves creativity and colour.
This game is the result of our common dream - to create a beautiful and memorable indie game to shine both visually and in gameplay. We are doing our best to achieve this goal and considering our team size - it is an epic challenge that we are more than glad to stand to!

Because we are a small, focused team, we wish on bringing you the best experience we dreamed of for Redum Of Sun. We don't want to sacrifice the quality of the core gameplay and feeling by placing our worktime somewhere else. We have some cool ideas for Stretch Goals, like Mac/Console ports, more language versions, more environments, or hiring Marketing Specialist so we can work more on the game itself, but we want to look objectively on what we can do in a given time. That's why we are focusing on bringing you a great game first, and accessory features second. Still, if optimistically we pierce the Main Goal with enough of your supportive power, Stretch Goals could appear in the future!
 

Do not expect that your support will go unnoticed! Every backer will recieve our gratitude, and for everyone who pledges 15$ and more, there will be rewards waiting!
(The delivery time of the physical rewards may be fluid, as they will be all hand-made and will need time to be made! :) )

<p>Vida began in 2008 like a one man effort to make an old school looking game with newer technology. This came in Nov/2009 with UDK release. The goal was never to make a game to children, but instead a title to <em>mature fans</em> enjoy a hack slash RPG game on 3d with a story, <em>mood</em> and themes <em>more suited</em> to a <em>mature audience</em>.</p>
<p>Vida players can just do whatever they want at Airen continent just needing to keep themselves alive (<em>no forced moral choices, just deal with consequences</em>). The game offers a big character evolution arc, lots of things to discover, places to explore, creatures to fight and brings also deeper aspects like faith, politics, religion and afterlife, all this on a bloody and dirty visual.</p>
<h3>Some features include:</h3>

<li>Offline Single Player Campaign.</li>
<li>TCP Multiplayer up to 4 players.</li>
<li>Easy modding since it’s being made on UDK.<br/>(...well, I'm just hearing your wishes. AND...)</li>
<li>Character’s evolution game (item’s set independent).</li>
<li>A real medieval dark world (adult themed situations/quests when fits on the story).</li>
<li>4 different areas: Airen, Manendil (the dead’s land), Abyss and the Celestial Plane.</li>

<h2>How it works:</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> Boundless Vengeance is an interactive fighting game featuring robots, which brings the world of fighting onto a whole new level. It enables you to control the robot movements by the motion of your body. </p>
<p>“Boundless Vengeance” set consists of three elements:</p>
<h3><b>        1.	Controller<b>       2. Robot<b>       3.	Interface <br/></b></b></b></h3>
<h3><b><b><b> </b></b></b></h3>
<div>
<b><b><b><h1><b><b>Elements cooperation</b></b></h1></b></b></b><br/><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-DFhbzGQ3tw&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-DFhbzGQ3tw&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During fight, all the elements cooperate with each other to 
create a consistent and complete system, realistic as never before. When
 a player performs a move, controller continuously reads sensorical 
indications, recognizes players activity and wirelessly sends according 
information to the robot. Interpretation algorithm classifies a movement
 as one of the possible movements (see Robot section) and corresponding 
servos make the Robot reproduce the movement. Second robot, if not 
protected, receives a blow and a signal on corresponding sensor is 
triggered. Information about robot being hit is sent to player’s 
smartphone and life count on the life bar decreases.</p>

Thanks to machine learning algorithms, controller adjusts itself to best <b>recognize YOUR OWN manner of performing punches</b>! Additionally one of the controllers (left or right – optionally) has a small joystick on the top to steer the robot around the designated fighting arena. </p>

<h1><b><b>Interface:</b></b></h1>
<div><b><b><br/></b></b></div>
<p>User interface is realized in a form of <b>smartphone application</b> downloadable from our website for every registered user. In the app the player can observe his and his opponents <b>current HP</b> (health points) count, <b>number of fights won</b> and the <b>time left</b> till the end of a round as shown below:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXRg2088DJBY&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FXRg2088DJBY&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><h2><br/></h2>
<p>In a final version, sound effects will provide an additional liveliness 
and dynamics of a gameplay. If a robot gets hit, his HP gets substracted
 accordingly to the kind of attack performed by a player. A round is won
 when the opponent loses all of his HP or the time is up. A specific 
order and gameplay rules give us a fantastic possibility to organize <b>tournaments </b>in
 which contestants could compete with each other and check both their 
skills and strategy. Every registered player will have his <b>ranking position</b> which will also be seen on the app. <br/></p>

<p>In „Boundless Vengeance: The Card Game”, you take part in the <b>martial arts tournament</b>. you become a couch, who has to train and arm his warriors to prepare them for the <b>countless bloody battles</b>. While confronting your opponents you will have to pay attention not only to the <b>health points</b> and <b>energy level</b> of your fighters but also to the connections and bonds between them. As a <b>team leader</b> you should use different tactics to beat up your enemies. You will have to decide either to <b>strengthen up</b> and <b>arm </b>one
 of your heroes, to make him fight one of your opponents, perform 
character changes and let your warriors regenerate their forces. 
Ultimately, number of <b>glory points </b>is what counts. For there can be only one winner...</p>

<p><i>From the left: Igor Maciąg, Jakub Wodnicki, Adam Kowalski</i><br/></p>
<p>I'm Jacob
Wodnicki and I am responsible for the creative part of the project. I study
italian philology at the Universty of Warsaw. In my free time I write short
stories, articles and scenarios. The idea of Boundless Vengeance project was
born in my head some time ago and<span>  I've
decided to get Adam (our chief engineer) involved. When he has given me the
green light (and contributed himself completely to the project) I've started to
construct the main plot and the backgrounds of the characters. From the very
begining I’ve worked with our artists to provide the visual effect of the
Indiegogo Campagin. My main aim in the field of graphics is to create the most
attractive, human-like robots and take are of the animations and artworks
presenting the universe. In future I plan to assemble a team of best writers
and artists I can find to provide you with a huge doze of world class entertainment.
Boundless Vengeance is just the beginning. I strongly believe that  our creative technological entertainment will
keep you very busy in the upcoming years.</span></p>
<p><span>My name is Adam Kowalski and I'm a Chief
Engineer in Cy-Tech Motion. I did my BSc degree in Physics at the Univeristy of
Warsaw and Mechatronics at Warsaw University of Technology. Then I gained MSc
degree in Electrical Engineering at the same University with half a year in
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. One sunny spring day I met
with my friend Jacob, currently our Creative Manager, who said ""I got an
idea and I need Your help. If it works, it could be huge!"". From that day
on I gradually transferred his raw concept into a technically applicable idea
which finally led us here, on indiegogo. During all that time I knew the most
important fact for me about this project - electronics is about designing real,
tangible systems with the elastic and changeable properties. </span><span>It is pure
creation and it's only the imagination of the designer that sets the limits!
Soon enough you'll see that led by this approach, me and my team will create
absolutely astonishing things - the first edition of Boundless Vengeance will
be just a takeoff into a long and exciting journey!</span></p>
<p>My name is
Igor Maciag, I'm responsible for business development of the Boundless Vengance
project. I'm Bachelor of Arts with a major in Marketing and now I study
Economics at Warsaw School of Economics. I'm experienced in start-up's development, so
that is why Jacob and Adam met with me one day and shared with me the whole
concept of Boundless Vengeance. I was very impressed! I had no doubts that this
project is huge and I was sure that I want to be part of it. Without hesitation
I told them: ""Guys, I'm in!"" and we started to
plan how to raise funds to build the prototype. I gave them couple of
propositions and we decided that Indiegogo is the best choice. Because we hope
that you all will be as excited about this project as we are. Next step we took
was team building. We involved into this project graphics, designers,<span>  mechanical and electrical engineers.  All of our team members are motivated to
provide our future customers with the highest quality product and to create a
completely new standard of entertainment. The biggest part of my job was
entrepreneurship. There was a lot of business planing aspects I had to deal
with. Legal, financial, marketing. I did my job as good as it was possible. And
now… We are fully prepared to bring the Boundless Vengeance project to life!<br/></span><br/></p>

<p>What we present you is just a first edition of Boundless Vengeance. 
This project creates huge perspectives of development practically in 
every on its aspects. In a future, we wish to focus on developing the <b>design of a robot</b> to enable it to perform more and more <b>complicated and spectacular movements</b> and to make players use <b>other parts of the body</b> to influence robots movements. On software level we aim to perfect our algorithm to make the movements <b>more fluent and dynamic</b> and even <b>more similar to human ones</b>. We will also work on developing <b>artificial intelligence</b> and <b>machine learning algorithms</b>
 to make the robot more aware of their own actions and interaction with 
an environment deepening the marvelous bond shared by a player and a 
robot.</p>

Most unique game fighting experience ever created! 



Ergonomic controller that brings Robots to life
Portable size 
Exciting tournaments
Game interface as a multi-feature mobile app 
Extra card game placed in the game universe 


Our goal is to build a prototype that will serve as a solid basis to build a
 fully developed product ready to enter the market and astonish you with
 its uniqueness and real-life experiences. We have technical concept, 
financial plan, human resources, rich game universe and vast, long-term
 prospects for development. The only thing we are missing is funds to 
build it.  Let's merge together into the entirely new quality of 
entertainment!






News section: 
We have a team of great engineers which will bring our robots to life! Check out  ""Meet our team engineers"" section to find out more!

How it works:
 Boundless Vengeance is an interactive fighting game featuring robots, which brings the world of fighting onto a whole new level. It enables you to control the robot movements by the motion of your body. 
“Boundless Vengeance” set consists of three elements:
        1.	Controller       2. Robot       3.	Interface 
 

Elements cooperation

During fight, all the elements cooperate with each other to 
create a consistent and complete system, realistic as never before. When
 a player performs a move, controller continuously reads sensorical 
indications, recognizes players activity and wirelessly sends according 
information to the robot. Interpretation algorithm classifies a movement
 as one of the possible movements (see Robot section) and corresponding 
servos make the Robot reproduce the movement. Second robot, if not 
protected, receives a blow and a signal on corresponding sensor is 
triggered. Information about robot being hit is sent to player’s 
smartphone and life count on the life bar decreases.


Take the game anywhere!

Controller:

Controllers are elements that enable to reproduce player’s movements by fighting robots and move them around the game area. They are in a form of ergonomic handles as shown below:
 Each player is equipped with two controllers (one per hand) and initiate robots movements by moving their hands. To make it possible, controllers perform a periodic 3-axis acceleration measurements in order to recognize your hand's motion and wirelessly send a proper information to Your robots. Thanks to machine learning algorithms, controller adjusts itself to best recognize YOUR OWN manner of performing punches! Additionally one of the controllers (left or right – optionally) has a small joystick on the top to steer the robot around the designated fighting arena. 



Sample from controller measurement aggregation systemRobot:

During gameplay, two robots, controlled by two opponents, fight each other reproducing player’s movements in real time. They are humanoid robots with great resemblance of human both in appearance and dynamics of movements. 
 3D concept-model for one of our robots17 servos and the suitable control algorythm will be responsible for rapid and fluent hits and movements. Tactile sensors placed on their body are responsible for detecting the damage inflicted by the opponent in a specific part of body. If hit – a proper signal is sent to a dedicated mobile app (read more in Interface subsection). If a robot falls on the ground it stands up independently in a very effective way. Robots interpret signals sent from controllers and classify them as one of the following movements: 
           a) straight 
           b) hook 
           c) uppercut 
           d) block 
Each of them can be performed on three heights – head, torso and stomach. Every character has also their specific combos realized as unique combinations of the movements presented above. Some movements can be also performed simultaneously (eg. high left punch and low right block etc.)

Interface:

User interface is realized in a form of smartphone application downloadable from our website for every registered user. In the app the player can observe his and his opponents current HP (health points) count, number of fights won and the time left till the end of a round as shown below:


In a final version, sound effects will provide an additional liveliness 
and dynamics of a gameplay. If a robot gets hit, his HP gets substracted
 accordingly to the kind of attack performed by a player. A round is won
 when the opponent loses all of his HP or the time is up. A specific 
order and gameplay rules give us a fantastic possibility to organize tournaments in
 which contestants could compete with each other and check both their 
skills and strategy. Every registered player will have his ranking position which will also be seen on the app.

Boundless vengeance card game:

In „Boundless Vengeance: The Card Game”, you take part in the martial arts tournament. you become a couch, who has to train and arm his warriors to prepare them for the countless bloody battles. While confronting your opponents you will have to pay attention not only to the health points and energy level of your fighters but also to the connections and bonds between them. As a team leader you should use different tactics to beat up your enemies. You will have to decide either to strengthen up and arm one
 of your heroes, to make him fight one of your opponents, perform 
character changes and let your warriors regenerate their forces. 
Ultimately, number of glory points is what counts. For there can be only one winner...

Meet our team:



From the left: Igor Maciąg, Jakub Wodnicki, Adam Kowalski
I'm Jacob
Wodnicki and I am responsible for the creative part of the project. I study
italian philology at the Universty of Warsaw. In my free time I write short
stories, articles and scenarios. The idea of Boundless Vengeance project was
born in my head some time ago and  I've
decided to get Adam (our chief engineer) involved. When he has given me the
green light (and contributed himself completely to the project) I've started to
construct the main plot and the backgrounds of the characters. From the very
begining I’ve worked with our artists to provide the visual effect of the
Indiegogo Campagin. My main aim in the field of graphics is to create the most
attractive, human-like robots and take are of the animations and artworks
presenting the universe. In future I plan to assemble a team of best writers
and artists I can find to provide you with a huge doze of world class entertainment.
Boundless Vengeance is just the beginning. I strongly believe that  our creative technological entertainment will
keep you very busy in the upcoming years.
My name is Adam Kowalski and I'm a Chief
Engineer in Cy-Tech Motion. I did my BSc degree in Physics at the Univeristy of
Warsaw and Mechatronics at Warsaw University of Technology. Then I gained MSc
degree in Electrical Engineering at the same University with half a year in
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. One sunny spring day I met
with my friend Jacob, currently our Creative Manager, who said ""I got an
idea and I need Your help. If it works, it could be huge!"". From that day
on I gradually transferred his raw concept into a technically applicable idea
which finally led us here, on indiegogo. During all that time I knew the most
important fact for me about this project - electronics is about designing real,
tangible systems with the elastic and changeable properties. It is pure
creation and it's only the imagination of the designer that sets the limits!
Soon enough you'll see that led by this approach, me and my team will create
absolutely astonishing things - the first edition of Boundless Vengeance will
be just a takeoff into a long and exciting journey!
My name is
Igor Maciag, I'm responsible for business development of the Boundless Vengance
project. I'm Bachelor of Arts with a major in Marketing and now I study
Economics at Warsaw School of Economics. I'm experienced in start-up's development, so
that is why Jacob and Adam met with me one day and shared with me the whole
concept of Boundless Vengeance. I was very impressed! I had no doubts that this
project is huge and I was sure that I want to be part of it. Without hesitation
I told them: ""Guys, I'm in!"" and we started to
plan how to raise funds to build the prototype. I gave them couple of
propositions and we decided that Indiegogo is the best choice. Because we hope
that you all will be as excited about this project as we are. Next step we took
was team building. We involved into this project graphics, designers,  mechanical and electrical engineers.  All of our team members are motivated to
provide our future customers with the highest quality product and to create a
completely new standard of entertainment. The biggest part of my job was
entrepreneurship. There was a lot of business planing aspects I had to deal
with. Legal, financial, marketing. I did my job as good as it was possible. And
now… We are fully prepared to bring the Boundless Vengeance project to life!

Ways of development:
What we present you is just a first edition of Boundless Vengeance. 
This project creates huge perspectives of development practically in 
every on its aspects. In a future, we wish to focus on developing the design of a robot to enable it to perform more and more complicated and spectacular movements and to make players use other parts of the body to influence robots movements. On software level we aim to perfect our algorithm to make the movements more fluent and dynamic and even more similar to human ones. We will also work on developing artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms
 to make the robot more aware of their own actions and interaction with 
an environment deepening the marvelous bond shared by a player and a 
robot.

How it proceeds:

Our indiegogo campaign and prototype development is just a beginning! Hard work awaits us in order to create a playable and attractive product and launch it on the market!

    Risks & Challenges:  
As the project is big and technologically advanced there are some risks concerning deadlines both in terms of pledges and product development. The biggest risks we are posed to are in the laboratory phase during which there is a chance our robots will malfunction. The possible difficulties we might face are insufficiently dynamic movement, problems with maintaining balance and lack of compatibility with the established standard moves and combinations. In such an event we must rethink the construction of our robot which may result in sufficient delays. Such situations can be avoided by proper management and control points in every phase of product development and tests (both elementary and systematic, after every accomplished task) .
Another risk is connected with divergence between the material presented above and the final result. We will put forth our biggest efforts to make sure our robots are as human like as possible, but this can result in a higher market price and stand in contrast with technical requirements (for instance proper mass distribution). This means we need to work out a reasonable compromise.
Our challenges are mainly related to keeping our robots human like and maintaining fluid movement, which will be achieved by elaborating high-quality control algorithms and a proper mechanical construction. Another challenge is connected to constant development of our plot and game universe, but our creative team will work on it continuously. Apart from that there is the challenge of building a proper tournament community and a system of promotion that encourages you to play Boundless Vengeance both in your houses and on our official events.

<p>Age of Barbarian II is a game for PC that is

<p>I am Christian Fanucci. I am the founder of Crian

""I move them.""</p>
<p>I've always been a big fan of the Sword and
Sorcery genre, Pulp, B-movies and games of the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Inspired precisely by these timeless classics,
Age of Barbarian tries to recreate the healthy atmosphere of B-movie that all
fans of the genre are aware of. Graphically, the game tries to be as close as
possible to an on-screen representation of the various illustrations of the
great artists of the genre, such as Frazetta and Buscema.</p>
<p>When Age of Barbarian was proposed to the public in
2011, it had quite an impact, an enthusiastic feedback, some good reviews but
also controversy, especially for the contents, especially for the half-naked
girls in the game. But talking about a sword and sorcery game, one can not miss
such items as the big and muscular barbarians, the succinct girls, the hordes
of bloodthirsty monsters, all the splatter and a pretty epic story and the
addictive soundtrack! </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p>Researchers and therapists say autistic children, independent of their intelligence, have trouble understanding of verbal concepts. They're not very good at recognizing social cues — or even the spoken words — that most people take for granted when they communicate. This can be overcome only by the use of pictures to support verbal codes.</p><p><i><b>""I THINK IN PICTURES.</b> Words are like a second language to me. I translate both spoken and written words into full-color movies"" </i>this is how Temple Grandin - novelist diagnosed with autism - describes her way of thinking.</p><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Words in Pictures (WP)</i> </span><b>is a COMPANION, A DAILY
HELP:</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> it allows a person to bring with them on their iPhone or iPad the cards
that link image and concept to be shown to the child. The cards work as</span><b> the
""words"" of  visual
communication.</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> One can easily search, build messages and quickly plan their day
on the agenda. The app is developed bearing in mind the needs of those who want
to interact with the autistic person. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Its </span><b>GOAL </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">is to enrich the communication
with visual supports, in order to aid the autistic person in the understanding. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Visual communication is widely recognised
as an effective way to support understanding. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nevertheless, the autistic child often
lacks of  intentional communication.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The <b>PECULIARITY</b> of the app lies in its
focus on the practical use by the adult. The app sets a gradual path in the
communication exchange which starts from the adult and is oriented to the
child. The emphasis is put on the sharing of meaning; then the autistic person
is encouraged to an ""outgoing"" active involvement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Perfect for use at </span><b>school, at home, as part of
therapy, or on the move</b>, the app is conveniently divided in <b>SECTIONS</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> with rapid access to features

Words in Pictures by Finger TalksPICTURES, WORDS, MESSAGES, AGENDA: the
first app expressly made to give parents, teachers and specialists an effective and portable tool for visual
communication to the child or adult suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorders or
intellectually impaired.
People with autism denote troubles understanding concepts that
can be solved only with the aid of pictures in support of verbal codes. Words
in Pictures use the mobile phone and tablet to
allow the users to carry along and to quickly show the child the cards that
link the image to the concept, helping autistic kids to live in a world
more understandable and predictable and to MAINTAIN A CONTACT with parents
and people around them.>>> The BEST ITALIAN APP for Patients AboutPharma Digital Awards 2013<<<                             About UsBorn (with the Italian name Immaginario) from an Italian team of experts in mobile marketing & development (Finger Talks) and speech therapists (Parole Tue) with the collaboration of neuropsychiatrists, educators and parents from all over the world who joined in both the design and the test (network), the app is now available on the App Store in 5 LANGUAGES and with advanced features.The campaign goalGive your contribution to the growth of the project and help us to extend the opportunity to use this effective tool to families who have access to ANDROID DEVICES (usually more affordable)Project description
Researchers and therapists say autistic children, independent of their intelligence, have trouble understanding of verbal concepts. They're not very good at recognizing social cues — or even the spoken words — that most people take for granted when they communicate. This can be overcome only by the use of pictures to support verbal codes.""I THINK IN PICTURES. Words are like a second language to me. I translate both spoken and written words into full-color movies"" this is how Temple Grandin - novelist diagnosed with autism - describes her way of thinking.
Words in Pictures (WP) is a COMPANION, A DAILY
HELP: it allows a person to bring with them on their iPhone or iPad the cards
that link image and concept to be shown to the child. The cards work as the
""words"" of  visual
communication. One can easily search, build messages and quickly plan their day
on the agenda. The app is developed bearing in mind the needs of those who want
to interact with the autistic person. 
Its GOAL is to enrich the communication
with visual supports, in order to aid the autistic person in the understanding. 
Visual communication is widely recognised
as an effective way to support understanding. Nevertheless, the autistic child often
lacks of  intentional communication.The PECULIARITY of the app lies in its
focus on the practical use by the adult. The app sets a gradual path in the
communication exchange which starts from the adult and is oriented to the
child. The emphasis is put on the sharing of meaning; then the autistic person
is encouraged to an ""outgoing"" active involvement.
Perfect for use at school, at home, as part of
therapy, or on the move, the app is conveniently divided in SECTIONS with rapid access to features
for parents and specialists and appealing graphics for the child:
Key Advantages

Testimonials


""In the last years, far from home without
velcro, paper, glue and scissors I felt without the means to let P. understand
what to do. With Words in Pictures even the simpler messages become clear. I
used many cards with photos. It's wondeful! What I wanted to explain has
finally become free from ambiguities and misunderstandings. We could understand
each other."" (A mum)

<br/><p>How often do you <b>check your phone</b> to see that – well – <b>nothing</b> happened and you didn't even check the time? Smartphone users do that approximately <b>150 times</b> a day. Wouldn't it be cool if you actually had a reason to check your phone every once in a while? We had the same problem and we decided to make <b>a game</b>. A game that takes into an account our constant needs to check our phone and give it a purpose.</p>
<p><b>Kawboom</b> is a turn-based competitive mobile game, where <b>friends plant bombs</b> to each other. It's an addictive strategy that brings friends together, stimulates the brain and kicks boredom <b>in the ass.</b> In Kawboom you plant bombs on your friends' mobile phones. If they discover your attack in time, they can use your bomb and plant it on theirfriends’ mobile phones totally unexpected. If they fail to catch the attack in time: <b>KAWBOOM!</b></p>
<p><b>Competing with friends</b> is the greatest source of <b>fun </b>there is. Remember the unforgettable feeling when you scored the last point in a match against your best friend or when you outmaneuvered your closest family member in an epic board game. But the sad truth is, that enjoying a good competition with your friends is often very expensive, sometimes dangerous and it’s always a nightmare to coordinate the time that is suitable for everyone. Kawboom is a <b>free </b>to play, you have to be really<b> clumsy </b>to actually get hurt by it and best of all, your friends are always<b> available.  </b></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/644811/files/20140612121256-logo.png?1402600376"" src="""" style=""width: 596.878px; height: 322px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<br/><p>Like many great ideas, the concept of Kawboom has been inspired by<b> real life </b>events. One of our favorite childhood games was to pretend, that a ball was a bomb and who ever could not pass it in 3 seconds to the next person playing, lost that round. It was a very simple concept which kept us occupied for hours. As children, we loved the <b>competitiveness</b> it brought out of us. We wanted to bring the same experience and fun through mobile phones. We kept the original idea of passing on bombs, but made it even more thrilling by expending the original gameplay with <b>power ups, shield</b>s, a charming<b> story</b> with funny <b>characters. </b><br/></p>
<br/><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646754/files/20140613085013-how.png?1402674613"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>This is a story of how a player gets his first bomb after login.</p>
<p>... Once upon a time on the other side of the universe there was a little <b>planet </b>called Kawboom. Darwin was not around to explain evolution, so the inhabitants evolve into little bombs. They found out that is incredibly<b> funny to explode</b> in the middle of the most serious situations. But a little bomb named <b>Gapo</b> was too little to explode. All the other bombs made fun of him and he decided to put an end to it. He jumped into an inter-dimensional wormhole and was transported to Earth where he was able to explode, because of the enriched oxygen environment. He can finally start pranking others. All he needs now is a<b> partner</b> with lots of friends ...</p><p><br/></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/640804/files/20140611033423-origin_story_1.png?1402482863"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""></h2><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646750/files/20140613084928-game.png?1402674568"" src="""" style=""width: 191.889px; height: 44px;""/></p>
<br/><p>After downloading the game you are asked to sign in with your Facebook account. Kawboom is meant to be<b> played with your friends</b> and we use Facebook so your friends are instantly in the game. Each new player gets one bomb that has a timer with one hour on the clock. Once you select a Facebook friend, the bomb leaves your phone and appears on
his. <b>The timer starts running</b>. Now your friend has to open the application and discover the attack in time. If he discovers the attack before the timer runs out, he can plant your bomb to another friend. When the bomb runs out of time it <b>explodes </b>on friends phone and takes him out of the game for 10 minutes. Everybody who passes the bomb forward is rewarded with <b>BoomCoins. </b>The original owner of the bomb and the last friend, that planted the bomb before explosion, get double amount of BoomCoins. </p><p></p>
<p>To make it more of a <b>strategy </b>and not just a game about opening the <span>application on time and select another friend, there is a rule, that each player has only 4 attacks. Once you use an attack, you have to wait for 30 minutes to get a new attack. This rule forces you to think about which bombs to keep and which to pass on. Because, if you pass on 4 bombs and use all 4 attacks at once and then you get a bomb whit in just
10 seconds on the clock you have no chance to defend yourself. </span></p>
<p>But the coolest features are<b> power-ups and shields. </b>Each bomb has a slot, where a power up can be added. You buy power ups with BoomCoins that you earned with successful attacks. Before you plant a bomb to a friend, you get the option to add a power up to the bomb if the slot is still empty. A bomb with an attached power has<b> special abilities.</b> For example: One of the power ups is called <b>“Money Sucker”</b>. This power up steals one BoomCoin for each minute, from the player, where the bomb is planted and gives it to the player that attached the power up. Power ups force players to use different strategies with different bombs. Shields can also be bought with
BoomCoins and counter the effects of power-ups.</p><p><br/></p>

</b>
</div>","How often do you check your phone to see that – well – nothing happened and you didn't even check the time? Smartphone users do that approximately 150 times a day. Wouldn't it be cool if you actually had a reason to check your phone every once in a while? We had the same problem and we decided to make a game. A game that takes into an account our constant needs to check our phone and give it a purpose.
Kawboom is a turn-based competitive mobile game, where friends plant bombs to each other. It's an addictive strategy that brings friends together, stimulates the brain and kicks boredom in the ass. In Kawboom you plant bombs on your friends' mobile phones. If they discover your attack in time, they can use your bomb and plant it on theirfriends’ mobile phones totally unexpected. If they fail to catch the attack in time: KAWBOOM!
Competing with friends is the greatest source of fun there is. Remember the unforgettable feeling when you scored the last point in a match against your best friend or when you outmaneuvered your closest family member in an epic board game. But the sad truth is, that enjoying a good competition with your friends is often very expensive, sometimes dangerous and it’s always a nightmare to coordinate the time that is suitable for everyone. Kawboom is a free to play, you have to be really clumsy to actually get hurt by it and best of all, your friends are always available.  

Like many great ideas, the concept of Kawboom has been inspired by real life events. One of our favorite childhood games was to pretend, that a ball was a bomb and who ever could not pass it in 3 seconds to the next person playing, lost that round. It was a very simple concept which kept us occupied for hours. As children, we loved the competitiveness it brought out of us. We wanted to bring the same experience and fun through mobile phones. We kept the original idea of passing on bombs, but made it even more thrilling by expending the original gameplay with power ups, shields, a charming story with funny characters. 

This is a story of how a player gets his first bomb after login.
... Once upon a time on the other side of the universe there was a little planet called Kawboom. Darwin was not around to explain evolution, so the inhabitants evolve into little bombs. They found out that is incredibly funny to explode in the middle of the most serious situations. But a little bomb named Gapo was too little to explode. All the other bombs made fun of him and he decided to put an end to it. He jumped into an inter-dimensional wormhole and was transported to Earth where he was able to explode, because of the enriched oxygen environment. He can finally start pranking others. All he needs now is a partner with lots of friends ...

After downloading the game you are asked to sign in with your Facebook account. Kawboom is meant to be played with your friends and we use Facebook so your friends are instantly in the game. Each new player gets one bomb that has a timer with one hour on the clock. Once you select a Facebook friend, the bomb leaves your phone and appears on
his. The timer starts running. Now your friend has to open the application and discover the attack in time. If he discovers the attack before the timer runs out, he can plant your bomb to another friend. When the bomb runs out of time it explodes on friends phone and takes him out of the game for 10 minutes. Everybody who passes the bomb forward is rewarded with BoomCoins. The original owner of the bomb and the last friend, that planted the bomb before explosion, get double amount of BoomCoins. 
To make it more of a strategy and not just a game about opening the application on time and select another friend, there is a rule, that each player has only 4 attacks. Once you use an attack, you have to wait for 30 minutes to get a new attack. This rule forces you to think about which bombs to keep and which to pass on. Because, if you pass on 4 bombs and use all 4 attacks at once and then you get a bomb whit in just
10 seconds on the clock you have no chance to defend yourself. 
But the coolest features are power-ups and shields. Each bomb has a slot, where a power up can be added. You buy power ups with BoomCoins that you earned with successful attacks. Before you plant a bomb to a friend, you get the option to add a power up to the bomb if the slot is still empty. A bomb with an attached power has special abilities. For example: One of the power ups is called “Money Sucker”. This power up steals one BoomCoin for each minute, from the player, where the bomb is planted and gives it to the player that attached the power up. Power ups force players to use different strategies with different bombs. Shields can also be bought with
BoomCoins and counter the effects of power-ups.

creative crew from El Kraken Ediciones has released this campaign to make
possible the first GLADIATORS ARENA board
game edition, along with its expansion: ADVANCED GLADIATORS ARENA.
Both
auto-playable, but they’re better if you play them simultaneously.
Thereby the game allows up to eight players at the same time.  El Kraken Ediciones da sus primeros pasos como editor de juegos: lanzamos la campaña crowdfunding con Indiegogo para crear la primera edición de GLADIATORS ARENA, junto con su expansión: ADVANCED GLADIATORS ARENA.Ambas ediciones del juego son totalmente autojugables e independientes, pero la diversión se multiplica si se juegan simultáneamente. La unión de ambos permitiría la participación de hasta ocho jugadores al mismo tiempo. GLADIATORS
ARENA has an exciting performance, where every movement and decision
is vital. Players will acquire the role of powerful warriors who will
fight against each other. Only the strongest survives! 

We have
designed this game full of details, offering an impeccable visual
appearance with striking ilustrations. But our most important
achievement has been developing an innovative way to play.  GLADIATORS ARENA funciona de manera trepidante, donde cada movimiento y decisión son vitales. Los jugadores encarnan a poderosos guerreros que lucharán los unos conlos otros. ¡Sólo el más fuerte sobrevivirá! El diseño del juego ha sido cuidado hasta el más mínimo detalle, ofreciendo un acabado visual impecable y rematado con poderosas ilustraciones. Pero el logro más importante del proyecto ha sido desarrollar una mecánica de juego innovadora.





No dices. No
cards. Action and strategy only. 

Easy to
learn, but a challenge to defiance! Players will secretly make their
combat movements, defensive tactics and deadly attacks. Afterwards,

<li>My name is Benji Powers, and I am a big ol' Iron Man fan living in Melbourne, Australia. I love to play video games, help people out, and more than anything I love to see people happy.</li>
<li>I have always loved providing help to those in need, and bringing smiles to those who cannot make one for themselves. It gives me hope when I see people who don't have much enjoying whatever life gives them. Some of the most hope I receive is when I see sick/disabled children happy and enjoying their life despite their setbacks. With video games being so important to me in my life, I want to help kids be able to experience fun and learning through this medium. I plan on making and buying parts to make an Iron Man suit, so I can go round to hospitals and charity events to donate video games, consoles, and toys to kids who are struggling. I want to do this with either Child's Play or the Starlight Foundation. Of course, first I will need a suit.</li>
<li>By donating, you will help me purchase the suit and everything I'd need to make Iron Man come to life.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>So here's the core of it:</p><ul>
<li>I need roughly $1,800 AUD to fund this project. This will go towards the suit itself, electronics to light up the suit, and getting parts shipped to Australia. The mask will move up and down, the hands and chest will have bright LEDs, and the joints near the chest and stomach will be lit up.</li>
<li>Two of the super cool perks will be where I come to a place of your choosing and surprise everyone around you by highfiving you as Iron Man, or even giving you a gift!</li>
<li>If the entire goal is not reached, I will continue anyway to work tirelessly to get this suit together. It will take time, but I don't want to give up on this goal. If the goal is not reached, your donations will be sent back to you.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>This project will bring smiles to children, and help towards pushing video game charities forward. I will also do my best to get involved with other charities if at all possible, including AGDQ and others.</li>
<li>I will be setting up a blog where you can follow any and all updates relating to the Iron Man project. This will include pictures and stories of significance.</li>

<p><strong>PLANK &amp; RANK </strong>is a two-player game in which you must build a bridge, plank-by-plank, across the Rhine River while simultaneously moving your army, rank-by-rank, to the opposite side.  But be careful, there may be a few snags and surprises along the way.  So choose your side, Roman Red or Barbarian Blue, and get ready to do battle.  Do you have the Gaul?</p>
<p><strong>PLANK &amp; RANK </strong>also has the honor of being one of five finalists in <strong>Hasbro's Next Great Game Challenge</strong>.  The success of this campaign will go a long way in helping me to win the competition and will further establish PLANK &amp; RANK as game night favorite.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475898046/x7gdccsbei2rwqlsirbs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>Be the first to build a bridge across the Rhine River and move all of your soldiers to the opposite side.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476305445/thbzjhsqqq93tqf10ilt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>SET-UP</strong></p>
<p>Pick a side - Roman Red or Barbarian Blue.  Each player has ten (10) color-coded tokens and a corresponding 10-sided die.  Place your ten tokens in the first ten spots on your designated side of the river.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476305792/opcbytvoo8wq0ackh8li.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Shuffle the deck of PLANK CARDS and deal FIVE (5) cards, face-down, to each player.  Place the remaining deck to the side as a DRAW PILE and flip one card face-up for a DISCARD PILE.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476305835/vpdtxmyirvujml0ylfb1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Roll your dice – the highest number goes first. </p>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong> </p>
<p>Each turn consists of two parts - PLANKING and RANKING.  Planking is the process by which one builds their bridge (using the PLANK CARDS).  Ranking is the process by which one moves their soldiers (tokens) across the bridge using the roll of the dice.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO PLANK</strong></p>
<p>Pick up a PLANK CARD from the DRAW PILE (or from the DISCARD PILE if one so chooses) and add it to your HAND.  You may then choose to <i>PLACE </i>a plank,  <i>SWAP</i> a plank, or <i>TOSS </i>a plank.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476306923/smmfhwljtnqsrjwfyerg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To <i>PLACE</i> a plank, you simply place one card, face-up, in the first available slot on your side of the river.  NOTE:  Each subsequent plank you later place must have a smaller numerical value than the previous, so that the bridge descends in size as it spans the river.  Planks DO NOT, however, have to be in direct sequential order.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476323624/lmotqwhlqd6pua86iv9l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you are unable to <i>PLACE</i> your plank, you may then either <i>SWAP</i> it or <i>TOSS</i> it.</p>
<p>To <i>SWAP</i> a plank, you simply switch a card from your hand with one previously placed on the river (keeping note of the “descending order” rule).  You then place the newly swapped plank into the DISCARD PILE.  NOTE:  You MAY NOT swap out a plank if any of your SOLDIERS (tokens) are currently standing on it.   So plan accordingly.</p>
<p>If you are unable or unwilling to <i>PLACE</i> or <i>SWAP</i> a plank, you can simply…</p>
<p><i>TOSS</i> a plank into the DISCARD PILE, keeping in mind that your opponent will be free to choose this card at the start of their turn.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO RANK: </strong></p>
<p>To RANK, you simply roll your DICE.  You may then choose to either <i>SCOUT</i> or <i>MARCH</i>.</p>
<p>To <i>SCOUT</i>, move ONE (1) token the given (X) number of spaces. </p>
<p>To <i>MARCH</i>, move MULTIPLE (X) tokens one (1) space, and one space only.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476323681/i6vgywvuiilyhifq5tlh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Moves cannot be divided between a <i>SCOUT</i> and a <i>MARCH</i>, and all moves must be completed in the EXACT number of spaces rolled (meaning that there are no extra or leftover moves once a piece or pieces have reached their intended spot(s).) </p>
<p>Tokens are free to move forward, backward, left or right in any form or fashion. They CANNOT move diagonally, JUMP other tokens, or DOUBLE-BACK over the same space within the same turn.</p>
<p>PLANKS will get smaller as they descend, so a token may have to compensate for this shift in size, moving sideways when needed.</p>
<p><strong>EVENT CARDS</strong> and <strong>BATTLE CARDS</strong></p>
<p>These cards are mixed in with the normal PLANK CARDS.  Players are free to save them in their HAND and play them at will.  To play one, simply place it on the DISCARD PILE at the start of your turn and follow the given instructions.</p>
<p>EVENT CARDS depict different actions which may help or hinder your progress.  Either you, your opponent, or both of you, will have to follow said instructions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476323977/qxyuvlinbfkgsosezngn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","PLANK & RANK is a two-player game in which you must build a bridge, plank-by-plank, across the Rhine River while simultaneously moving your army, rank-by-rank, to the opposite side.  But be careful, there may be a few snags and surprises along the way.  So choose your side, Roman Red or Barbarian Blue, and get ready to do battle.  Do you have the Gaul?
PLANK & RANK also has the honor of being one of five finalists in Hasbro's Next Great Game Challenge.  The success of this campaign will go a long way in helping me to win the competition and will further establish PLANK & RANK as game night favorite.
 

 
OBJECTIVE
Be the first to build a bridge across the Rhine River and move all of your soldiers to the opposite side.

SET-UP
Pick a side - Roman Red or Barbarian Blue.  Each player has ten (10) color-coded tokens and a corresponding 10-sided die.  Place your ten tokens in the first ten spots on your designated side of the river.

Shuffle the deck of PLANK CARDS and deal FIVE (5) cards, face-down, to each player.  Place the remaining deck to the side as a DRAW PILE and flip one card face-up for a DISCARD PILE.

Roll your dice – the highest number goes first. 
GAMEPLAY 
Each turn consists of two parts - PLANKING and RANKING.  Planking is the process by which one builds their bridge (using the PLANK CARDS).  Ranking is the process by which one moves their soldiers (tokens) across the bridge using the roll of the dice.
HOW TO PLANK
Pick up a PLANK CARD from the DRAW PILE (or from the DISCARD PILE if one so chooses) and add it to your HAND.  You may then choose to PLACE a plank,  SWAP a plank, or TOSS a plank.

To PLACE a plank, you simply place one card, face-up, in the first available slot on your side of the river.  NOTE:  Each subsequent plank you later place must have a smaller numerical value than the previous, so that the bridge descends in size as it spans the river.  Planks DO NOT, however, have to be in direct sequential order.

If you are unable to PLACE your plank, you may then either SWAP it or TOSS it.
To SWAP a plank, you simply switch a card from your hand with one previously placed on the river (keeping note of the “descending order” rule).  You then place the newly swapped plank into the DISCARD PILE.  NOTE:  You MAY NOT swap out a plank if any of your SOLDIERS (tokens) are currently standing on it.   So plan accordingly.
If you are unable or unwilling to PLACE or SWAP a plank, you can simply…
TOSS a plank into the DISCARD PILE, keeping in mind that your opponent will be free to choose this card at the start of their turn.
HOW TO RANK: 
To RANK, you simply roll your DICE.  You may then choose to either SCOUT or MARCH.
To SCOUT, move ONE (1) token the given (X) number of spaces. 
To MARCH, move MULTIPLE (X) tokens one (1) space, and one space only.

Moves cannot be divided between a SCOUT and a MARCH, and all moves must be completed in the EXACT number of spaces rolled (meaning that there are no extra or leftover moves once a piece or pieces have reached their intended spot(s).) 
Tokens are free to move forward, backward, left or right in any form or fashion. They CANNOT move diagonally, JUMP other tokens, or DOUBLE-BACK over the same space within the same turn.
PLANKS will get smaller as they descend, so a token may have to compensate for this shift in size, moving sideways when needed.
EVENT CARDS and BATTLE CARDS
These cards are mixed in with the normal PLANK CARDS.  Players are free to save them in their HAND and play them at will.  To play one, simply place it on the DISCARD PILE at the start of your turn and follow the given instructions.
EVENT CARDS depict different actions which may help or hinder your progress.  Either you, your opponent, or both of you, will have to follow said instructions.



BATTLE CARDS require both players to ROLL THEIR DICE.  The highest number wins.  The winner can then choose to remove ANY PLANK from their opponent’s bridge.  (Any tokens on that plank are moved back to the START).  The winning player may then SWAP the stolen plank with any of their own (following the above rules for swapping) if they so choose.

The discarded plank card is then placed BENEATH the discarded BATTLE CARD, removing it from availability on the next turn.
If rolling the dice results in a tie, the battle simply ends and regular gameplay continues. 
Once the entire stack of PLANK CARDS has been played through, simply shuffle and flip the DISCARD PILE and start again.
TO WIN 
The first player to build their bridge (and keep it intact) while simultaneously moving all of their tokens safely to the opposite side wins the game

<h3>Locations and cities</h3>
<p>Locations shown on the map play important role in the game play. Named major cities and locations works as places to investigators to gain equipments,weapons and even spells which will help them on quests. There are even certain locations with pubs where the player can hire new investigators to change or replace deceased or mad investigators.</p>
<br/><p>The Great Old Ones are not just watching, they are actually fighting against investigators, though not having physical form (at least in early game) they can still spawn <b>gates</b> and <b>monsters</b> to locations. Ravaging monsters and cults on cities will decreases locations<b> sanity</b> and when inhabitants in the location fall to total madness, whole city is lost and investigators <b>can’t get any</b> equipment or heal themselves in hospitals. </p>
<p>While dealing with these <b>tasks </b>around the world, the player has to manage each investigator’s sanity, health, gear and money, as well as each major city’s sanity level and the global sanity level. If player fails<b> too many</b> of these tasks and the <b>global sanity</b> level goes to zero, then the ancient one awakens and starts to annihilate the world city by city. After every turn there are numerous things that can happen, these can be good or bad for the player. For example spawning new monsters or even police forces dealing with some of monsters. </p>

<h3><span>Choose time to fight or run</span></h3>
<br/><p><b>Day and night cycle</b> have also important aspect in the game. Some monster will be stronger in the night time and without source of light, investigators accuracy in combat will suffer greatly. Also it is always scarier to travel in darkness. </p>
<br/><p><b>Combat</b> in the game is <b>card based</b>, weapons, items, skills and spells act as your cards which you collect throughout the game. Each investigator has their own skill set so cards handle <b>differently</b> depending on which investigator is using them. For example spell-casters aren’t great at handling firearms and the weak minded might be driven mad if they try to cast spells or they can even <b>backfire</b>. </p>

<br/><p>The encounters, except for the monsters are <b>text based multi choice tasks</b>, where every choice can lead to different outcome depending on the investigator handling the encounter. Your choice can lead to another encounter in some other location or you might gain an item, regain health, suffer sanity loss or even meet your untimely death.</p>

<h3>Monster behavior</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>There are many monster and creatures in H.P.Lovecraft’s stories and tales.
Many unspeakable horrors lurk in the shadows. We plan to implement most of the
known eldritch monsters to our game amongst the Great Old Ones.</p>
<p>Players also encounters normal human beings like cultists and possessed
people who may first seem weak, but they can also cast spells and use firearms
to protect their gods.</p>
<p>Every monster has different behaviors depending on their roles. Player
should plan their moves and tactics carefully to get around certain monsters.
Luckily there are skills, spells and items to help, and sometimes even destiny
may be on the player’s side. </p>
<p><b>Wanderers</b></p>
<p>Wanderers are passive monsters who moves around the map, these monsters
will travel randomly around the world without any specific target. </p>
<p><b>Gate guards</b></p>
<p>Monsters with this behavior are protecting locations with a gate to another
dimension. Usually investigators need to get rid of the gate guard before they
can proceed to close the gate. </p>
<p><b>Ravagers</b></p>
<p>Ravagers seek locations where they will cause mayhem and destruction. This
causes a drop in the location’s sanity, which will make the investigator's life
much harder.</p>
<p><b>Evaders</b></p>
<p>Evading monsters will try to evade locations where investigators are, their
purpose is to irritate and sidetrack the investigators. They also may cause
mayhem when entering major locations. </p>
<p><b>Hunters</b></p>
<p>Hunters will actively search for investigators and try to kill them or
drive them insane. These monster are usually most dangerous because of their
aggressiveness.  </p>
<p><b>Trackers</b></p>
<p>Tracking monster follows the investigators around the world and try to
block their routes. </p>
<p>Need to get on ship? Yep, good luck with that Nightgaunt blocking your way
to a port city. </p>

<h3><b>Current Status</b></h3>The game has been in development over 10 months and is currently in pre-alpha stage. Most of the features and the content creating tools are ready and the game is playable. <br/><br/>The final game is aimed to be released late 2015. We also aim to support Steam Workshop so the community can bring their own horror stories into the game.</div>
<div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435321171/gqqqotll0hpgjuiqdqv1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Who we are ? </h3>We are Blackland Games Ltd. From Finland, Kouvola. Blackland Games is formed by 5 experienced game developers with backgrounds with multiple released titles  such as Trine, Alan Wake (PC-version)  and many more. So don't worry we can deliver what we promise.</div>
<div>Mythos is not first title of Blackland Games. We have successfully shipped mobile game <b>Planetary Guard: Defender</b> which is available for all mobile devices. In the meantime you are waiting the Mythos to be arrived you are very welcome to enjoy our previous title ( Free 2 Download ). </div>

<p>80 000€ covers all the work which are described image above. Which are approximately 40% of the whole project.</p>
</div>
<div>The game itself is in pre-alpha phase where almost every feature is done. But we need more time to make those features extremely good. Also the game needs more content on stories, items, events and characters. So we need the funding to secure our rest of development and launch. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">With your help we will secure our development and launch, also we will be able to add proper music and sound effect talent to work, and possibility to hire help with content creation and maybe even eat once in a while.  With that funding we can guarantee a finished game and best experience what Blackland Games can offer. </span><br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Crowdfunding</h3> <p>We have pitched the game to dozens of game publishers and gotten great feedback and business proposals but we feel the final game would benefit more from the freedom we can get with crowdfunding. Not only we have a total creative freedom, our hands won't be tied when it comes to business side of things (pricing etc.).</p>
<p>By choosing this road, we have taken a huge risk in terms of money, time and exposure we'll get with the game by doing everything by ourselves so we hope everyone will support us and join the ride.<br/><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>While we are a bunch of game industry professionals trying to make a living with the games we'd love to play (and make) and we're determined to finish the game regardless the ending result of this campaign, there are few things that might endanger finishing the product (but not its release).</p>
<p>Production wise we are confident there won't be any surprises but before the game is released, we'll have to go through many long and challenging steps where all the factors and variables unfortunately aren't in our hands.</p>

Do you have nerves to face unspeakable creatures? Only a thin line of rational thinking and sanity prevents collapse of the humankind.

Tons of content updates
PC, Mac and Linux releases



Worldmap

One of the main aspects in the Mythos The Awakening is map gameplay around the World. Player works as mastermind behind individual investigators who travel around unraveling mysteries,following clues and fighting against Eldricht beings. Investigators are persons with different backgrounds,agendas and proficients, usually men-and women of science are best suitable to handle cosmic energies so called “spells” while a private investigator and former boxing champion take cares of fighting against abominations. All of them have one goal to stop awakening of the great old ones but not everybody are contributing with most chivalrous agenda.

Locations and cities
Locations shown on the map play important role in the game play. Named major cities and locations works as places to investigators to gain equipments,weapons and even spells which will help them on quests. There are even certain locations with pubs where the player can hire new investigators to change or replace deceased or mad investigators.
The Great Old Ones are not just watching, they are actually fighting against investigators, though not having physical form (at least in early game) they can still spawn gates and monsters to locations. Ravaging monsters and cults on cities will decreases locations sanity and when inhabitants in the location fall to total madness, whole city is lost and investigators can’t get any equipment or heal themselves in hospitals. 
While dealing with these tasks around the world, the player has to manage each investigator’s sanity, health, gear and money, as well as each major city’s sanity level and the global sanity level. If player fails too many of these tasks and the global sanity level goes to zero, then the ancient one awakens and starts to annihilate the world city by city. After every turn there are numerous things that can happen, these can be good or bad for the player. For example spawning new monsters or even police forces dealing with some of monsters. 


tough situation, help London or get rid of that Deep One before it cause harm in Istanbul?

Choose time to fight or run
Day and night cycle have also important aspect in the game. Some monster will be stronger in the night time and without source of light, investigators accuracy in combat will suffer greatly. Also it is always scarier to travel in darkness. 
Combat in the game is card based, weapons, items, skills and spells act as your cards which you collect throughout the game. Each investigator has their own skill set so cards handle differently depending on which investigator is using them. For example spell-casters aren’t great at handling firearms and the weak minded might be driven mad if they try to cast spells or they can even backfire. 

The encounters, except for the monsters are text based multi choice tasks, where every choice can lead to different outcome depending on the investigator handling the encounter. Your choice can lead to another encounter in some other location or you might gain an item, regain health, suffer sanity loss or even meet your untimely death.






Monster behavior

There are many monster and creatures in H.P.Lovecraft’s stories and tales.
Many unspeakable horrors lurk in the shadows. We plan to implement most of the
known eldritch monsters to our game amongst the Great Old Ones.
Players also encounters normal human beings like cultists and possessed
people who may first seem weak, but they can also cast spells and use firearms
to protect their gods.
Every monster has different behaviors depending on their roles. Player
should plan their moves and tactics carefully to get around certain monsters.
Luckily there are skills, spells and items to help, and sometimes even destiny
may be on the player’s side. 
Wanderers
Wanderers are passive monsters who moves around the map, these monsters
will travel randomly around the world without any specific target. 
Gate guards
Monsters with this behavior are protecting locations with a gate to another
dimension. Usually investigators need to get rid of the gate guard before they
can proceed to close the gate. 
Ravagers
Ravagers seek locations where they will cause mayhem and destruction. This
causes a drop in the location’s sanity, which will make the investigator's life
much harder.
Evaders
Evading monsters will try to evade locations where investigators are, their
purpose is to irritate and sidetrack the investigators. They also may cause
mayhem when entering major locations. 
Hunters
Hunters will actively search for investigators and try to kill them or
drive them insane. These monster are usually most dangerous because of their
aggressiveness.  
Trackers
Tracking monster follows the investigators around the world and try to
block their routes. 
Need to get on ship? Yep, good luck with that Nightgaunt blocking your way
to a port city. 




Current StatusThe game has been in development over 10 months and is currently in pre-alpha stage. Most of the features and the content creating tools are ready and the game is playable. The final game is aimed to be released late 2015. We also aim to support Steam Workshop so the community can bring their own horror stories into the game.


Who we are ? We are Blackland Games Ltd. From Finland, Kouvola. Blackland Games is formed by 5 experienced game developers with backgrounds with multiple released titles  such as Trine, Alan Wake (PC-version)  and many more. So don't worry we can deliver what we promise.
Mythos is not first title of Blackland Games. We have successfully shipped mobile game Planetary Guard: Defender which is available for all mobile devices. In the meantime you are waiting the Mythos to be arrived you are very welcome to enjoy our previous title ( Free 2 Download ). 
  Goals
Why 80 000, you ask ?  Rather big you say ? Here is why.







80 000€ covers all the work which are described image above. Which are approximately 40% of the whole project.

The game itself is in pre-alpha phase where almost every feature is done. But we need more time to make those features extremely good. Also the game needs more content on stories, items, events and characters. So we need the funding to secure our rest of development and launch. 

With your help we will secure our development and launch, also we will be able to add proper music and sound effect talent to work, and possibility to hire help with content creation and maybe even eat once in a while.  With that funding we can guarantee a finished game and best experience what Blackland Games can offer. 

 Full launch is estimated late 2015.  





    Why Crowdfunding We have pitched the game to dozens of game publishers and gotten great feedback and business proposals but we feel the final game would benefit more from the freedom we can get with crowdfunding. Not only we have a total creative freedom, our hands won't be tied when it comes to business side of things (pricing etc.).
By choosing this road, we have taken a huge risk in terms of money, time and exposure we'll get with the game by doing everything by ourselves so we hope everyone will support us and join the ride.
    Risks & Challenges While we are a bunch of game industry professionals trying to make a living with the games we'd love to play (and make) and we're determined to finish the game regardless the ending result of this campaign, there are few things that might endanger finishing the product (but not its release).
Production wise we are confident there won't be any surprises but before the game is released, we'll have to go through many long and challenging steps where all the factors and variables unfortunately aren't in our hands.

Rewards ? 
Where is all the cool stuff ? No T-Shirts ? Well no, we believe that game itself is best reward and best way to give contribution for the game. And we are not going to promise too much because we are small team and we have to concentrate on the game and deliver you a really good product. Instead of we would spend our time making T-Shirt and shipping those to you, Right ?  
Everyone who contributes to our IndieGoGo and chooses reward which includes Steam key, will receive the full game and early access to our beta version of course.

We’ve also added our own touch by introducing multi-use tools to the puzzle equation as well. <br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Where the Money Goes</h2><p>Here’s our budget!

More than anything this will be buying us the ability to work full-time on the game. We estimate that with full funding, Castaway Kirk will be available to you, wrapped in a neat pink bow and a sparkly box (figuratively of course), in less than a year from the end date of our campaign. </p><p><br/></p><h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2><p>Let’s be honest: Its difficult to find high quality games in the ocean of indie content and unregulated standards. Digital distribution platforms have revolutionized the video game industry, yes, and we send them all of their deserving praise. In fact we fully intend to partake in the Steam Greenlight Project at our earliest convenience. Now if you sense a “but” coming, it’s because there is. BUT… a whole lot of sifting through half-finished “Early Access” games has become necessary. So, you probably want some proof that we’re not just talking your ear off, right?</p><p>The proof is in the demo. The last year of prototyping has come to fruition in a free fully playable (and immediately available to you) standalone download. You can download it now from everybody’s favorite and most reputable indie developer support network: <a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/games/castaway-kirk/downloads"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiedb.com</a>.</p><p>Majesty3D’s motto is “Integrity first.” Under no circumstances will we compromise our vision. Furthermore, under no circumstances will you ever see a sub-par product with our studio’s name on it, let alone an unfinished one. Slowly but surely, we aim to contribute to that fleeting pool of gems, and make the ocean surrounding that oasis seem a little less daunting.</p><p><br/></p><h2>What Lies Before Us</h2><p>Allow an indulgence, if you will, in an extended ""Alice in Wonderland"" analogy. Imagine yourself going down the rabbit hole. You come to an opening at the end of the rabbit hole. There are now a dozen more rabbit hole entrances into which you are free to dive. But which one do you choose? You can’t choose all of them... can you? Maybe you can just go down one, see what’s in it real quick, use it to your advantage, and then come back up and go down a different one? Make a day of it? WRONG!</p><p>Welcome to game design. Every different type of developer’s hat each of us tries to wear represents a new challenge and a new rabbit hole: Genre’s, game engines, 2D and 3D image manipulation (software options, modeling, rigging, animation, rendering, texturing), audio editing, video editing, web development, marketing, digital distribution integration, launching/installation software, testing capability, business management, etc. Game developers require the confidence to say “I can totally learn a new game engine. No problem!” but the wisdom and humility to say “I need help. I’m not very good at this particular task, but that’s okay.”</p><p>Multitudes of affronting brick walls have repeatedly smacked us in the face with their scratchy cat-tongue-like and inexplicably primate shaped appendages, adding insult to injury with a swaggering attitude that just won’t stop. In response to this we said “No sir, I don’t like that.”  Josh didn’t know how to code in C# a year ago. Now he does. Rex couldn’t texture a model to save his life. Just take a look at the Adventure bag in the image gallery. You want one now don’t you? That’s what we thought. So what’s our plan for the pitfalls ahead? Bull-headed stubbornness and grace under pressure haven’t failed us yet, so we’re just gonna stick with that.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>Monetary donations are fantastic, but we completely understand those in a situation where they can’t donate. So, there are a few ways that you can further our project without having to open your wallet. Obviously sharing the campaign and telling others about it is the simplest and most straightforward way to help.</p><p>Beyond just general social media traffic the number one place we request you check out is our Indie Database page. That’s the main site we use for all our news and game related traffic. IndieDB.com ranks games by popularity, and the higher your ranking, the more attention your game can get. While page views are a big part of that, it’s only one facet of what they track. Downloads, comments, and “Watchers” contribute a great deal to the game’s rank. So, if you love our game, and just indie games in general, head <a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over there</a> and set up a profile. Then head to our <a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/games/castaway-kirk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">game page</a> and click the “Track this game” link in the sidebar. Shortly after the end of this crowd funding campaign, maybe even before, we’ll be launching or Steam Greenlight campaign. For those of you who don’t know about Steam Greenlight: it is a way for indie games to get distribution on Steam, which is Valve Software's extremely popular digital distribution platform. Similar to IndieDB's ranking system, it is powered by votes. With enough votes from users, Valve will greenlight the game and instantly put us underway for global distribution. A lot of games use this method to be sold as “Early Access” affording them additional funds for development. Majesty 3D, however, will not be doing so. As prviously mentioned we don't believe in releasing an unfinished product. Although patches are often necessary, to be expected, and easily applied via Steam, our first release will be the full finished version of Castaway Kirk.</p><br/></div>","Play The Demo - Download The Demo

Down and dirty style…$1500… Unity Pro (Supports PC/Mac/Linux Standalone)$1500… Unity Android Package (Covers licensing and cross platform support)$2000… For bringing in other talent (such as composers and translators.)$1000… 3rd party assets, including but not limited to: Play Maker, NGUI, RFPS, Control Freak, Quick Ropes, and Steam Greenlight registration fee$8000… Production time and perks. More than anything this will be buying us the ability to work full-time on the game. We estimate that with full funding, Castaway Kirk will be available to you, wrapped in a neat pink bow and a sparkly box (figuratively of course), in less than a year from the end date of our campaign. What Sets Us ApartLet’s be honest: Its difficult to find high quality games in the ocean of indie content and unregulated standards. Digital distribution platforms have revolutionized the video game industry, yes, and we send them all of their deserving praise. In fact we fully intend to partake in the Steam Greenlight Project at our earliest convenience. Now if you sense a “but” coming, it’s because there is. BUT… a whole lot of sifting through half-finished “Early Access” games has become necessary. So, you probably want some proof that we’re not just talking your ear off, right?The proof is in the demo. The last year of prototyping has come to fruition in a free fully playable (and immediately available to you) standalone download. You can download it now from everybody’s favorite and most reputable indie developer support network: Indiedb.com.Majesty3D’s motto is “Integrity first.” Under no circumstances will we compromise our vision. Furthermore, under no circumstances will you ever see a sub-par product with our studio’s name on it, let alone an unfinished one. Slowly but surely, we aim to contribute to that fleeting pool of gems, and make the ocean surrounding that oasis seem a little less daunting.What Lies Before UsAllow an indulgence, if you will, in an extended ""Alice in Wonderland"" analogy. Imagine yourself going down the rabbit hole. You come to an opening at the end of the rabbit hole. There are now a dozen more rabbit hole entrances into which you are free to dive. But which one do you choose? You can’t choose all of them... can you? Maybe you can just go down one, see what’s in it real quick, use it to your advantage, and then come back up and go down a different one? Make a day of it? WRONG!Welcome to game design. Every different type of developer’s hat each of us tries to wear represents a new challenge and a new rabbit hole: Genre’s, game engines, 2D and 3D image manipulation (software options, modeling, rigging, animation, rendering, texturing), audio editing, video editing, web development, marketing, digital distribution integration, launching/installation software, testing capability, business management, etc. Game developers require the confidence to say “I can totally learn a new game engine. No problem!” but the wisdom and humility to say “I need help. I’m not very good at this particular task, but that’s okay.”Multitudes of affronting brick walls have repeatedly smacked us in the face with their scratchy cat-tongue-like and inexplicably primate shaped appendages, adding insult to injury with a swaggering attitude that just won’t stop. In response to this we said “No sir, I don’t like that.”  Josh didn’t know how to code in C# a year ago. Now he does. Rex couldn’t texture a model to save his life. Just take a look at the Adventure bag in the image gallery. You want one now don’t you? That’s what we thought. So what’s our plan for the pitfalls ahead? Bull-headed stubbornness and grace under pressure haven’t failed us yet, so we’re just gonna stick with that.Other Ways You Can HelpMonetary donations are fantastic, but we completely understand those in a situation where they can’t donate. So, there are a few ways that you can further our project without having to open your wallet. Obviously sharing the campaign and telling others about it is the simplest and most straightforward way to help.Beyond just general social media traffic the number one place we request you check out is our Indie Database page. That’s the main site we use for all our news and game related traffic. IndieDB.com ranks games by popularity, and the higher your ranking, the more attention your game can get. While page views are a big part of that, it’s only one facet of what they track. Downloads, comments, and “Watchers” contribute a great deal to the game’s rank. So, if you love our game, and just indie games in general, head over there and set up a profile. Then head to our game page and click the “Track this game” link in the sidebar. Shortly after the end of this crowd funding campaign, maybe even before, we’ll be launching or Steam Greenlight campaign. For those of you who don’t know about Steam Greenlight: it is a way for indie games to get distribution on Steam, which is Valve Software's extremely popular digital distribution platform. Similar to IndieDB's ranking system, it is powered by votes. With enough votes from users, Valve will greenlight the game and instantly put us underway for global distribution. A lot of games use this method to be sold as “Early Access” affording them additional funds for development. Majesty 3D, however, will not be doing so. As prviously mentioned we don't believe in releasing an unfinished product. Although patches are often necessary, to be expected, and easily applied via Steam, our first release will be the full finished version of Castaway Kirk.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

the title would also come out on <b>home consoles</b> (PS3, X Box 360, WiiU, PS4, Xbox

St Seiya, Yuyu Hakusho, Naruto or One Piece.</p>
<p>Why choose this graphic universe? <b>Because it allows  a free and easily malleable universe, without
the limits of realism. A big opportunity for artists' creativity!</b></p>
<p>This will be found in the variety of scenery,
the character design, the gameplay and the possibility to have more dynamic
animations.</p>
<p>However, ""Story of Heroes"" <b>is not a ""fanservice ""!</b></p>
<p>A whole universe is developed, <b>to give life to this unique gameplay,</b>
which offers a different <b>approach to
combat.</b></p>
<p>The scenario also is not left out, since it is
not only a story of Demon, who wants to destroy the universe, and a Hero who
helps to save the poor scared girl ! No, it's more than that.</p>

Finally, although the
game world is clearly colored, it will expect a touch of violence! (since we
are talking about from the beginning, a game that is threatening, brutal,
powerful and nervous!). But without being violent or gore.<div>

<p>These are the words, heard by Kaïzen .... And
since that day, he confronts the demons everywhere in the universe. For
centuries, his power made his numerous enemies surrender, giving new hope for
the forces of good, who saw in his person 
the providential Hero.</p>
<p>This situation triggered the wrath of the
dreaded Demon Lord Rendel. His army, led by horrible Commander Jinra was
ordered to eliminate this so-called hero . Despite incessant enemy waves, the
Hero remained inexhaustible. Faced with such a demonstration of power, the
Demons could only be defeated. And Victory was to prevail ...</p>
<p><u>""<b>The
rumor that changed the victory!! Legendary Weapon appears !!""</b></u></p>
<p><b>A

<p>Soon, <b>the
legend</b> spread across the universe, until Demons. <b>The High Priestess Ezia,</b> was afraid that such a weapon exists,
because if it could fall into the hands of the Lord Rendel, it would be the <b>end of time</b>. She sent her <b>Soldiers</b> to find this weapon and  <b>destroy
it definitively.</b></p>
<p>The Lord Rendel sent <b>Jinra</b> in search of this weapon, which could help him defeat his
archenemy, that has  become too powerful
....The Lord Rendel, sent Jinra to look for the legendary weapon, the only way
to destroy his archenemy, who has succeeded to be better than he was ...</p>
<p>Centuries later, the Commander <b>finally found the legendary weapon</b>, and
brought it to his lord. He was astonished because he always thought  that  t
this weapon was only a legend ... But no, it wasn't... it was there,  in his hands.</p>
<p>The High Priestess Ezia was informed, and did
not know what to do. She could not send her troops to a <b>certain defeat</b>. She did not understand either the absence of heroes
to prevent this ...Alas, it was too late, and the Lord Rendel <b>used the weapon</b> ... the end of life

of the Lord Rendel, who came to understand <b>the

<p><b>Rendel</b>, Lord of Demons, has one ambition: he wants to govern the universe and

<p>Like many independent studios, Rykeï Studios, is
a group of enthusiasts who have been working for more than 10 years in the
video game world. With our experiences, we are able to realize our project. We
have all the skills and the adequate team to complete the project in its
entirety!</p>
<p>However, the reality of the video game industry
is cruel: this game will never be financed by a major studio, or given a grant.
In such situation, Marketing is what will enable or not this project to be created.
.</p>
<p>That's why we want to deal with the real
decision makers: <b>the players</b>. Only
you will make it possible for this project to be continued or not. .</p>
<p>The overall design of the game is estimated at 72 000
Euros. 2D animations, represent 50% of the amount requested. The reason for
that amount is that the enemy bestiary (and Boss) is well supplied and full of
varieties, to avoid clashes routine. Same thing for Hero. And especially for
fluid dynamics and traditional animation.</p>
<p>In addition, proposing  nice graphics and complete gameplay is good,
but it is also important to have voices for the characters. The ideal would be
to have a Japanese dubbing (and subtitled in different languages, as good
fansubs!), Given the universe of the game.</p>
<p>As in Rykeï Studios, <b>we do not accept to put a price on a mediocre game</b>, the continuity
of the project will be made <b>only if the
amount requested is reached.</b></p>
<p>Also note that if Fortunately, the campaign goes
beyond all expectations, <b>there will be
additional content, to make the experience even more perfect! (note, not DLC,
but integrated directly into the game!).</b></p>
<p>And if it goes beyond, but really to infinity
(like 100 000 euros), <b>the home consoles
will receive the game!</b></p>
<p><b><u>Thanks for your help!</u></b></p>

<p>Le design du jeu est de type Manga/Anime s'inspirant des
grandes œuvres comme Dragon Ball, St Seiya, Yuyu Hakusho, Naruto ou One Piece. </p>
<p>Pourquoi opter pour cet univers graphique?
Car cela permet d'avoir <b>un univers bien
plus libre et facilement malléable, sans avoir les limites du réalisme. </b>Une
aubaine pour la créativité des artistes !</p>
<p>Cela se ressentira à travers <b>la variété des décors, du design des
personnages, et</b> <b>du gameplay</b> et donne
la possibilité d'avoir des animations plus dynamiques.</p>
<p>Cependant, ""Story of Heroes"" <b>n'est pas un ""fan service"" !</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Tout
un univers est développé, pour <b>donner
vie à ce gameplay unique</b>, qui propose une approche <b>de combat différente</b>.</p>
<p>Le
scénario également, n'est pas en reste, puisque ce n'est pas seulement une
histoire de Démon qui veut détruire l'Univers, et un Héros qui vient en aide
pour sauver la pauvre jeune fille apeurée ! Non, c'est plus que ça!</p>
Enfin, bien que l'univers du jeu soit clairement
coloré, il faudra s'attendre à une touche de violence ! (puisque on parle
depuis le début, d'un jeu qui soit menaçant, brutal, nerveux et puissant !).
Mais sans toutefois être gore.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1084967/files/20141209174619-Indiegogo_English_1-2.jpg?1418175979"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Le guerrier peut exécuter des attaques au

<p>Pendant les phases de <b>Shoot'em em up</b>, il est aussi à l'aise, avec de nombreuses attaques

<p>Les ennemis et Boss, sont tout autant déterminés à en
découdre ! Surtout après leurs <b>terribles
raclées</b> reçues dans le passé, mais aussi pour <b>la terrible humiliation</b> que vient de leur infliger Kaïzen (c'est à
vous de comprendre pourquoi !).</p>
<p>Ils sont également redoutables, et disposent d'attaques

<p>- Simple Attack,</p>

<p>- Combo, </p>
<p>- Super Combo, </p>

<p>- Back/Front Flip, </p>
<p>- Counter, </p>
<p>- Counter Attack, </p>
<p>- Teleportation, ect
...</p>
<p>De plus, <b>ils
attaquent en groupe</b>, et ont des <b>scénarii
d'attaques</b>. Par exemple, l'un d'eux fait le kamikaze en explosant sur
Kaïzen, immédiatement surpris par un autre ennemi caché jaillissant du sol !</p>
<p>Autre exemple, ils attaquent à deux, mais feintent en se
retirant pour laisser place à un 3ème ennemi ripostant par surprise.</p>
<p>Enfin, ils sont prêts à surgir de partout : <b>du fond de décor, du premier plan, des airs
ou du sol : tout est permis...</b></p>
<b>Des combats totalement épiques, à maintenir sans
relâche !</b><br/><p><b></b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Ce sont les
paroles qu'entendit <b>Kaïzen</b>... Depuis
ce jour, il affronte les Démons, partout dans l'Univers. Depuis des siècles, sa
puissance tressaille ses nombreux ennemis, redonnant l'espoir aux forces du
bien, qui voient en cet être, le Héros providentiel.</p>
<p>Ce qui
déclencha les foudres du redoutable <b>Seigneur
Démon Rendel</b>. Toute son armée, dirigée par l'horrible <b>Commandant Jinra</b>, avait pour ordre de prendre en cible ce soit
disant Héros, pour <b>l'éliminer</b>. Malgré
des vagues ennemis incessantes, le Héros resta <b>inépuisable</b>. Devant une telle <b>démonstration
de puissance, </b>les Démons ne pouvaient être que vaincus. La victoire
semblait donc acquise...</p>
<p><b><u>""La rumeur qui fit basculer la
victoire : l'apparition de l'Arme Légendaire !!!""</u></b></p>
<p><b>La légende raconte</b> qu'il existerait <b>une
arme</b> qui doterait son possesseur de la <b>Puissance
Ultime</b>, celle du Grand Créateur. Ce pouvoir anéantirait toute trace de vie.</p>
<p>Très vite la <b>légende </b>se répandit au-travers de
l'univers, jusqu'au Démons. </p>
<p>La <b>Grande</b> <b>Prêtresse</b> <b>Ezia</b> redoutait
qu'une telle arme existe, car si elle parvenait à tomber entre les mains du
Seigneur Rendel, ce serait <b>la fin des
temps</b>. Elle envoya ses <b>Soldats</b> trouver
cette arme afin de la<b> détruire
définitivement.</b></p>
<p>Le Seigneur
Rendel envoya <b>Jinra</b> à la recherche
de l'Arme légendaire, seul moyen d'anéantir son ennemi suprême l'ayant désormais
surpassé...</p>
<p>Des siècles
plus tard, le Commandant <b>trouva enfin l'Arme
Légendaire</b>, qu'il rapporta à son seigneur. Ce dernier était stupéfait,
pensant que cette arme n'était qu'une légende...Pourtant non, il la tenait bien
entre ses mains.</p>
<p>La Grande
Prêtresse Ezia fut informée, et ne savait plus quoi faire. Elle ne pouvait envoyer
ses troupes vers <b>une défaite certaine</b>.
Elle ne comprenait pas non plus l'absence du héros pour empêcher cela...</p>
<p>Hélas, il fut
trop tard, et le Seigneur Rendel <b>utilisa

<p><b><u>""Incroyable... Qu'as-tu fait, héros

<p>""<b>Enfoiré...Misérable...""  </b>furent les seuls mots du Seigneur Rendel,
qui venait de comprendre <b>la supercherie </b>!

<p>Mais qu'a donc
fait Kaizen ? Pourquoi a t'il trompé la confiance de la Grande Prêtresse Ezia ?
Et pourquoi le Seigneur des Démons sombra dans l'humiliation, alors qu'il

<p>Comme
beaucoup de studios indépendants, <b>Rykeï
Studios</b> est un regroupement de passionnés, qui travaillent depuis plus de
10 ans dans le monde du jeu vidéo. Forts de nos expériences, nous sommes en
mesure de concrétiser notre projet. Nous avons toutes les compétences et
l'équipe, pour mener à bien le projet dans sa globalité !</p>
<p>Cependant,
la réalité de l'industrie du jeu vidéo est cruelle : un tel jeu ne serra jamais
financé par un grand studio, ou par une subvention. Le marketing est seul
décisionnaire dans ces situations-là.</p>
<p>C'est
pour cela que nous nous adressons aux véritables décideurs, <b>les joueurs.</b> Vous seuls prendrez la
décision de la continuité du projet ou non.</p>
<p>La
conception globale du jeu est estimée à 72 000 Euros. Les animations 2D
représentent 50% de la somme demandée. Car le bestiaire ennemis (et Boss) est
très fourni et différent, pour éviter la routine des affrontements. Idem, pour
le Héros. Et surtout, pour avoir des animations traditionnelles fluides et
dynamiques.</p>
<p>De
plus, avoir de beaux graphismes et un gameplay complet, c'est bien, mais il est
important d'avoir également des voix pour les personnages. L'idéale serait
d'avoir un doublage Japonais (et sous titré en différentes langues, comme de
bons fansubs !), compte tenu de l'univers du jeu.</p>
<p>Comme
chez Rykeï Studios, nous <b>n'acceptons pas</b>
de mettre un prix sur un jeu médiocre, la continuité du projet ne se fera que
si <b>la somme demandée est atteinte. </b></p>
<p>Sachez
également que si par bonheur, la campagne va au delà de toute attente, <b>il y aura du contenu supplémentaire,</b>
pour rendre l'expérience encore plus parfaite! <b>(attention, pas en DLC, mais intégré directement dans le jeu !).</b></p>
<p>Et
si cela va au delà, mais vraiment vers l'infini (genre 100 000 Euros), les
consoles de salon pourront accueillir le jeu ! </p>
<p><b><u>Merci
pour votre aide!</u></b></p>

<br/>
</div></div>","La version française, est plus bas! Merci""Story of Heroes"" is a 2D action game,
with phases of shoot'em up, designed to adapt several major criteria:
-fun and entertainement for the players (it's
always exciting to chain attacks, it causes a sense of mastery and power!)
-various and rhythmic game sequences, 
-different angles of
action views: the threat comes from all sides, the feeling of danger is omnipresent
-technical
and aggressive gameplay for the player who leads fights with a fearsome power
- A Hero, with a very wide range of shots
combined with awesome combination opportunities, sometimes brutal, sometimes
humiliating (see an enemy in sweat in
front of a demonstration of power, it is a supreme delight!)-a varied bestiary of enemies and Boss , with
different special moves to avoid the
monotony of fighting,
-a high level of difficulty (but adjustable for
beginners!) basis, and two others (""Too hard"" and
""Climax""), available from the beginning,
-a scenario that develops the identity of the
characters, and shows the power of the Hero as soon as he appears, causing
terror and helplessness of the Forces of Evil.The game is developed for PC and Mac. Ideally,
the title would also come out on home consoles (PS3, X Box 360, WiiU, PS4, Xbox
One), but this port means a higher cost (100 000 Euros).The design of the game is like  Manga / Anime and is  inspired by great works such as Dragon Ball,
St Seiya, Yuyu Hakusho, Naruto or One Piece.
Why choose this graphic universe? Because it allows  a free and easily malleable universe, without
the limits of realism. A big opportunity for artists' creativity!
This will be found in the variety of scenery,
the character design, the gameplay and the possibility to have more dynamic
animations.
However, ""Story of Heroes"" is not a ""fanservice ""!
A whole universe is developed, to give life to this unique gameplay,
which offers a different approach to
combat.
The scenario also is not left out, since it is
not only a story of Demon, who wants to destroy the universe, and a Hero who
helps to save the poor scared girl ! No, it's more than that.

Finally, although the
game world is clearly colored, it will expect a touch of violence! (since we
are talking about from the beginning, a game that is threatening, brutal,
powerful and nervous!). But without being violent or gore.



You take control of the Fearsome and Powerful
Kaizen, which will ask you to pass through 16 main levels to accomplish its
mission. Remark, is determined and demanding, and hope the players eliminate ALL enemies without exception, and to
put terror on these miserable! Players will need to make big scores to be equal
Kaizen.


The warrior can attack the body, use weapon, and
energy attacks (""KI""). His power is huge, and since birth, he learned
all kinds of techniques:
-Simple Attack,
-Super Attack,
-Combo,
-Super Combo,
-Hyper Combo,
-Double Combo,
-Divine Combo,
-Divine Attack,
-Finish Attack,
-Defense,
-Dodge,
-Back / Front Flip,
-Counter,
-Counter Attack,
-Teleportation,
-Defense Combo
-Energy Shield, and more!

And during the phases of
Shoot em up, it is also comfortable, with many attacks based on the fireballs,
but also attacks of the body, and weapon's duels!

Yes, it has become the perfect fighter, knowing
neither fear nor pity. Nobody can stop
even a Game Over!

The enemies and Boss, are as much determined to
do battle! Especially after their terrible
beatings received in the past, but also to the terrible humiliation that comes from their inflict Kaizen (that is,
you understand why!).
They are also redoutable, and have devastating
attacks and defenses:
-Simple Attack
-Super Attack
-Combo,
-Super Combo
-Duo Combo
-Dark Attack
-Defense,
-Dodge,
-back / Front Flip
-Counter,
-Counter Attack
-Teleportation, and more!
In addition, they attack in groups, and attack
using scenari. For example, one of them is a kamikaze that exploses on
Kaïzen, who is immediately surprised by another hidden enemy, springing from
the ground!
Another example, they attack in pairs, but feint
by disappear to make way for a third enemy, this attacking by surprise.
Finally, they can emerge from everywhere: the
backdrop, foreground, air or soil, everything is allowed...
Totally
epic fights to maintain your entertain at the upmost!


And yes! If Kaizen fights fiercely and without
mercy, using her formidable fighting skills, the Terror gauge will get filled , and the enemies will begin to
doubt, will hesitate to attack, and will escape in terror!
Be careful if you let them escape, Kaizen will not be very happy, and you
will make him lose points! And most
importantly, the Supreme correction
will not be completed!



For
the first time in a game, you have the perfect warrior ever in your hands, do
not miss out on this power by being 
small players!

It must be a pad 8 buttons and 2 3Dstick! For
this type of game, the pad is essential for comfort and speed of action.
Moving / combinations Hero is with the D-Pad
(Left Stick or 3D). Button for attacks and defenses.
3D stick Right, will enable you to target during
shoot'em up sequences. But during 
the  sequences of actions,  it will make you lock your next enemy, or you
will be able to teleport.

Whether through the Gamedesign, Level design,
charcaters design, script, music or animation, everything is meant to provide a
puzzling adventure (in a good way).
Indeed, playing ""Story of Heroes"", you will be constantly surprised.
Indeed, the variety will not be found only on
alternating phases of action / shooter game, but everywhere, and make the course of the adventure and the
evolution of the protagonists, even more
surprising.
The
goal is to provide a confusing game in concept, with a story developed, a
gameplay making sense of the power of the characters, through rich fighting,
attacks scenarios varied and complex. And other surprises too! And in a
complete game (not DLC).

The
Universe .... In these places, there are Supreme Beings who are waging a battle
for milleniums. They are not immortal, but thanks to their ""Souls
Power"", they can live for several thousand years. But the end of their
fight is to come very soon  ..
""The
prayer of desperation, and the birth of a Hero""
""I'm
Ezia the High Priestess of the Universe, I implore you, Great Creator, to help
us .... The Forces of Evil are increasingly present, and the Demon Lord Rendel
spreads the chaos. The Forces of Good is no longer numerous enough to protect
us, please, help us .... ""
These are the words, heard by Kaïzen .... And
since that day, he confronts the demons everywhere in the universe. For
centuries, his power made his numerous enemies surrender, giving new hope for
the forces of good, who saw in his person 
the providential Hero.
This situation triggered the wrath of the
dreaded Demon Lord Rendel. His army, led by horrible Commander Jinra was
ordered to eliminate this so-called hero . Despite incessant enemy waves, the
Hero remained inexhaustible. Faced with such a demonstration of power, the
Demons could only be defeated. And Victory was to prevail ...
""The
rumor that changed the victory!! Legendary Weapon appears !!""
A
legend says, that there is a weapon that would give its possessor the Ultimate Power, the Great Creator. It can destroy all lives.
Soon, the
legend spread across the universe, until Demons. The High Priestess Ezia, was afraid that such a weapon exists,
because if it could fall into the hands of the Lord Rendel, it would be the end of time. She sent her Soldiers to find this weapon and  destroy
it definitively.
The Lord Rendel sent Jinra in search of this weapon, which could help him defeat his
archenemy, that has  become too powerful
....The Lord Rendel, sent Jinra to look for the legendary weapon, the only way
to destroy his archenemy, who has succeeded to be better than he was ...
Centuries later, the Commander finally found the legendary weapon, and
brought it to his lord. He was astonished because he always thought  that  t
this weapon was only a legend ... But no, it wasn't... it was there,  in his hands.
The High Priestess Ezia was informed, and did
not know what to do. She could not send her troops to a certain defeat. She did not understand either the absence of heroes
to prevent this ...Alas, it was too late, and the Lord Rendel used the weapon ... the end of life
seemed inevitable...
""Amazing
!!!! What did you do Hero !!!!""
""Why
.... why did you do such a thing, Hero .... I gave you my trust and you
betrayed me ....""
These are the words uttered Ezia the High
Priestess of the Universe ....
""Miserable
Bastard .... ...."" .... was the only words
of the Lord Rendel, who came to understand the
deception! A humiliation too ....
But so what did Kaizen do ? Why did he betray
the High Priestess Ezia? And therefore why was the Lord of Demons so humiliated
when it  seemed that he  has the weapon to defeat the Hero?
Discover
who Kaizen truly is and how the Dark Forces gave him total victory ....

Rendel, Lord of Demons, has one ambition: he wants to govern the universe and
impose his clan to the detriment of humanity. The first step is to eliminate
the Priestess, who is hiding throughout the galaxy. But since the advent of
Kaizen, and since his severe defeats, he swears to destroy this Universe to
erase all traces of this humiliation.

Ezia
the High Priestess is the guardian of the
whole Universe. She protects humans, she has all the knowledge. She lives in a
hidden kingdom, in the center of the universe, but no human or demon does not
know her name or where she is located. She fights for millennia, the army of
Rendel. Coupled with this sudden appearance of a hero, victory seems certain.
But she was surprised when the hero began ""this act"" ...

Kaizen is the greatest warrior and nothing can stop it. This is a intelligent
fighter, complete and ruthless. His name is unknown to all, even the Priestess
Ezia. He defeated the Demons, but does not want to stop there, and more desire:
permanently erase the Dark Forces. For this, he committed ""an act"" which angry the Priestess,
and horrified Rendel ....



Like many independent studios, Rykeï Studios, is
a group of enthusiasts who have been working for more than 10 years in the
video game world. With our experiences, we are able to realize our project. We
have all the skills and the adequate team to complete the project in its
entirety!
However, the reality of the video game industry
is cruel: this game will never be financed by a major studio, or given a grant.
In such situation, Marketing is what will enable or not this project to be created.
.
That's why we want to deal with the real
decision makers: the players. Only
you will make it possible for this project to be continued or not. .
The overall design of the game is estimated at 72 000
Euros. 2D animations, represent 50% of the amount requested. The reason for
that amount is that the enemy bestiary (and Boss) is well supplied and full of
varieties, to avoid clashes routine. Same thing for Hero. And especially for
fluid dynamics and traditional animation.
In addition, proposing  nice graphics and complete gameplay is good,
but it is also important to have voices for the characters. The ideal would be
to have a Japanese dubbing (and subtitled in different languages, as good
fansubs!), Given the universe of the game.
As in Rykeï Studios, we do not accept to put a price on a mediocre game, the continuity
of the project will be made only if the
amount requested is reached.
Also note that if Fortunately, the campaign goes
beyond all expectations, there will be
additional content, to make the experience even more perfect! (note, not DLC,
but integrated directly into the game!).
And if it goes beyond, but really to infinity
(like 100 000 euros), the home consoles
will receive the game!
Thanks for your help!




                                   Version Française:




""Story of Heroes"" est un jeu d'action 2D, avec
des phases de shoot'em up, conçu pour remplir plusieurs critères importants : 
- l'amusement et la joie des joueurs (c'est toujours
excitant d'enchainer des combos, cela provoque un sentiment de maîtrise et de puissance !)
- des séquences de jeu variées et rythmées
- différents angles de vues d'action :la menace vient de tous les cotés, la sensation du danger est omniprésente
- un gameplay technique
et agressif pour le joueur qui
dirige des combats d'une puissance effroyable
- un Héros, dotant d'un très vaste choix de coups, aux possibilités d'enchainements
impressionnantes, brutales, parfois même humiliantes (voir un ennemi en sueur,
devant une démonstration de puissance, c'est une délectation suprême !)

- des bestiaires d'ennemis et de Boss variés, avec un large panel d'attaques, pour le
plaisir du challenge
- un niveau de difficulté élevé de base (mais réglable,
pour les ceintures blanches !), et deux autres plus hardcore (""Too
hard"" et ""Climax""), disponibles dés le début
- un scénario qui développe l'identité des personnages,
et qui montre la puissance du Héros dés son apparition, devant entraîner la
terreur et l'impuissance des Forces du Mal.


Le
jeu est développé pour sortir sur PC et Mac. Idéalement, le titre sortirait
également sur consoles de salon (PS3, X Box 360, WiiU, PS4, XBox One), mais ce
portage a un coût plus important (100 000 Euros).

Le design du jeu est de type Manga/Anime s'inspirant des
grandes œuvres comme Dragon Ball, St Seiya, Yuyu Hakusho, Naruto ou One Piece. 
Pourquoi opter pour cet univers graphique?
Car cela permet d'avoir un univers bien
plus libre et facilement malléable, sans avoir les limites du réalisme. Une
aubaine pour la créativité des artistes !
Cela se ressentira à travers la variété des décors, du design des
personnages, et du gameplay et donne
la possibilité d'avoir des animations plus dynamiques.
Cependant, ""Story of Heroes"" n'est pas un ""fan service"" !

Tout
un univers est développé, pour donner
vie à ce gameplay unique, qui propose une approche de combat différente.
Le
scénario également, n'est pas en reste, puisque ce n'est pas seulement une
histoire de Démon qui veut détruire l'Univers, et un Héros qui vient en aide
pour sauver la pauvre jeune fille apeurée ! Non, c'est plus que ça!
Enfin, bien que l'univers du jeu soit clairement
coloré, il faudra s'attendre à une touche de violence ! (puisque on parle
depuis le début, d'un jeu qui soit menaçant, brutal, nerveux et puissant !).
Mais sans toutefois être gore.

Vous dirigez le Redoutable
et Puissant Kaïzen, qui vous
demandera de traverser 16 grands niveaux
pour accomplir sa mission. Attention, il est déterminé et exigeant, et espère que les joueurs seront prêts à
éliminer tous les ennemis sans
exception, et à instaurer la terreur
sur ces misérables ! Les joueurs devront faire de gros scores pour être à la
hauteur de Kaïzen.


Le guerrier peut exécuter des attaques au
corps, à l'arme blanche, et lancer des attaques énergétiques (""KI"").
Son pouvoir n'a pas d'égal, et depuis sa naissance, il a appris toutes sortes
de techniques :
- Simple Attack, 
- Super Attack, 
- Combo, 
- Super Combo, 
- Hyper Combo, 
- Double Combo, 
- Divin Combo, 
- Divin Attack, 
- Finish Attack, 
- Defense, 
- Dodge, 
- Back/Front Flip, 
- Counter, 
- Counter Attack, 
- Teleportation, 
- Defense Combo, 
- Energy Shield, et bien d'autres!
Pendant les phases de Shoot'em em up, il est aussi à l'aise, avec de nombreuses attaques
basées sur les boules de feu, mais également des coups aux corps à corps et des
duels à l'arme !

Oui, il est devenu le parfait combattant, ne connaissant
ni la peur, ni la pitié. Personne ne
peut l'arrêter, pas même un Game Over !




Les ennemis et Boss, sont tout autant déterminés à en
découdre ! Surtout après leurs terribles
raclées reçues dans le passé, mais aussi pour la terrible humiliation que vient de leur infliger Kaïzen (c'est à
vous de comprendre pourquoi !).
Ils sont également redoutables, et disposent d'attaques
et de défenses dévastatrices:
- Simple Attack,
- Super Attack, 
- Combo, 
- Super Combo, 
- Duo Combo, 
- Dark Attack, 
- Defense, 
- Dodge, 
- Back/Front Flip, 
- Counter, 
- Counter Attack, 
- Teleportation, ect
...
De plus, ils
attaquent en groupe, et ont des scénarii
d'attaques. Par exemple, l'un d'eux fait le kamikaze en explosant sur
Kaïzen, immédiatement surpris par un autre ennemi caché jaillissant du sol !
Autre exemple, ils attaquent à deux, mais feintent en se
retirant pour laisser place à un 3ème ennemi ripostant par surprise.
Enfin, ils sont prêts à surgir de partout : du fond de décor, du premier plan, des airs
ou du sol : tout est permis...
Des combats totalement épiques, à maintenir sans
relâche !


Et oui ! Si Kaïzen se bat avec acharnement et sans pitié,
en utilisant ses redoutables techniques de combat, la jauge de Terreur se remplira, et les ennemis commenceront à douter,
hésiteront à attaquer, et se sauveront avec terreur !
Attention, si vous les laisser s'enfuir, Kaïzen ne sera pas très satisfait, et
vous lui ferez perdre des points ! Enfin
et surtout, la correction suprême,
ne sera pas totale ! 



Pour la première fois
dans un jeu, vous avez le guerrier parfait entre les mains, ne passez pas à
coté de cette puissance en faisant ""les petits joueurs!""

Pour
un tel type de jeu, le pad est indispensable pour le confort et la rapidité des
actions, ainsi que 8 boutons et deux 3D Sticks.
Les
déplacements / combos du Héros se font avec le D-Pad (ou 3D Stick Gauche). Les boutons
servent aux attaques et défenses.
Le 3D stick Droit sert de visée pour les séquences de
shoot'em up. Mais également pendant les séquences actions, par exemple pour
locker un prochain ennemi, ou se téléporter. 

Que
cela soit au travers du Gamedesign, Level design, Charcater design, scénario,
musiques ou animations, tout est fait en sorte pour proposer une aventure déroutante (dans le bon sens).
En effet, en jouant à ""Story of Heroes"", vous serez constamment surpris.
En
effet, la variété ne s'arrête pas à l'alternance des phases de jeu en action/shoot,
mais aussi sur tous les points, et
rendra le déroulement de l'aventure et l'évolution des protagonistes, encore plus surprenante.
L'objectif est de proposer un jeu déroutant
dans son concept, avec une histoire développée, un gameplay faisant ressentir
toute la puissance des personnages, à travers des combats riches, des scénarii
d'attaques variés et complexes. Également d'autres surprises ! Le tout dans un
jeu complet (pas de DLC).

L'Univers....En ces
lieux, il existe des Etres Suprêmes qui se livrent une bataille depuis des
millénaires. Ils ne sont pas immortels, mais grâce à leurs ""Ames de
Puissance"", ils peuvent vivre pendant plusieurs millénaires. Mais la
fin de leur combat, était proche.. 

""La prière du désespoir, la
naissance d'un Héros""
""Je suis Ezia la Grande Prêtresse de l'Univers, je vous implore, Grand Créateur, de nous
venir en aide ...Les Forces du Mal sont de plus en plus présentes, et le Seigneur
Démon Rendel sème le chaos. Les Forces du Bien ne sont plus assez nombreuses
pour nous protéger, par pitié, aidez-nous ...""

Ce sont les
paroles qu'entendit Kaïzen... Depuis
ce jour, il affronte les Démons, partout dans l'Univers. Depuis des siècles, sa
puissance tressaille ses nombreux ennemis, redonnant l'espoir aux forces du
bien, qui voient en cet être, le Héros providentiel.
Ce qui
déclencha les foudres du redoutable Seigneur
Démon Rendel. Toute son armée, dirigée par l'horrible Commandant Jinra, avait pour ordre de prendre en cible ce soit
disant Héros, pour l'éliminer. Malgré
des vagues ennemis incessantes, le Héros resta inépuisable. Devant une telle démonstration
de puissance, les Démons ne pouvaient être que vaincus. La victoire
semblait donc acquise...
""La rumeur qui fit basculer la
victoire : l'apparition de l'Arme Légendaire !!!""
La légende raconte qu'il existerait une
arme qui doterait son possesseur de la Puissance
Ultime, celle du Grand Créateur. Ce pouvoir anéantirait toute trace de vie.
Très vite la légende se répandit au-travers de
l'univers, jusqu'au Démons. 
La Grande Prêtresse Ezia redoutait
qu'une telle arme existe, car si elle parvenait à tomber entre les mains du
Seigneur Rendel, ce serait la fin des
temps. Elle envoya ses Soldats trouver
cette arme afin de la détruire
définitivement.
Le Seigneur
Rendel envoya Jinra à la recherche
de l'Arme légendaire, seul moyen d'anéantir son ennemi suprême l'ayant désormais
surpassé...
Des siècles
plus tard, le Commandant trouva enfin l'Arme
Légendaire, qu'il rapporta à son seigneur. Ce dernier était stupéfait,
pensant que cette arme n'était qu'une légende...Pourtant non, il la tenait bien
entre ses mains.
La Grande
Prêtresse Ezia fut informée, et ne savait plus quoi faire. Elle ne pouvait envoyer
ses troupes vers une défaite certaine.
Elle ne comprenait pas non plus l'absence du héros pour empêcher cela...
Hélas, il fut
trop tard, et le Seigneur Rendel utilisa
l'arme... la fin de la vie semblait inéluctable...
""Incroyable... Qu'as-tu fait, héros
!?!""
""Pourquoi...Pourquoi as-tu fait une chose
pareille... Je t'ai donné toute ma confiance, tu m'as trompée...""

Ce sont les
paroles que prononça Ezia la Grande
Prêtresse de l'Univers...
""Enfoiré...Misérable...""  furent les seuls mots du Seigneur Rendel,
qui venait de comprendre la supercherie !
Une humiliation de trop...
Mais qu'a donc
fait Kaizen ? Pourquoi a t'il trompé la confiance de la Grande Prêtresse Ezia ?
Et pourquoi le Seigneur des Démons sombra dans l'humiliation, alors qu'il
semblait posséder l'Arme pour vaincre le Héros ?
Découvrez, qui est véritablement Kaïzen, et comment les
Forces du Mal lui ont offert la victoire totale...


Rendel, le Seigneur des Démons, ne jure que par une
ambition : gouverner l'Univers et imposer sa race au détriment de l'humanité. La
première étape consiste à éliminer la Prêtresse, qui se cache dans toute la
galaxie. Mais depuis l'apparition de Kaïzen, et depuis ses sévères corrections
reçues, il ne jure de détruire cet Univers que pour effacer toute trace de cette
humiliation.


La Grande Prêtresse Ezia est la gardienne de tout
l'Univers. Elle protège les humains, elle a toutes les connaissances. Elle vit
dans un Royaume caché, au centre de l'Univers, mais aucun humain ou Démon ne
connait ni son nom ni sa localisation. Elle affronte depuis des millénaires l'armée de Rendel. Couplée
à cette apparition fortuite d'un héros, la victoire semble acquise. Mais
qu'elle ne fut pas sa surprise, lorsque ce héros entreprit ""cet acte""...

Kaïzen est le plus grand de tous les guerriers et
rien ne peut l'arrêter. C'est un combattant intelligent, complet et
impitoyable. Son nom est inconnu de tous, même de la Prêtresse Ezia. Il a
vaincu les Démons mais ne souhaite pas s'en arrêter là. Il désire plus pour que
les Forces du Mal soient totalement et définitivement annihilées. C'est pour
cela qu'il commit ""un acte"",
mettant en rage la Prêtresse, tout en horrifiant Rendel...


Comme
beaucoup de studios indépendants, Rykeï
Studios est un regroupement de passionnés, qui travaillent depuis plus de
10 ans dans le monde du jeu vidéo. Forts de nos expériences, nous sommes en
mesure de concrétiser notre projet. Nous avons toutes les compétences et
l'équipe, pour mener à bien le projet dans sa globalité !
Cependant,
la réalité de l'industrie du jeu vidéo est cruelle : un tel jeu ne serra jamais
financé par un grand studio, ou par une subvention. Le marketing est seul
décisionnaire dans ces situations-là.
C'est
pour cela que nous nous adressons aux véritables décideurs, les joueurs. Vous seuls prendrez la
décision de la continuité du projet ou non.
La
conception globale du jeu est estimée à 72 000 Euros. Les animations 2D
représentent 50% de la somme demandée. Car le bestiaire ennemis (et Boss) est
très fourni et différent, pour éviter la routine des affrontements. Idem, pour
le Héros. Et surtout, pour avoir des animations traditionnelles fluides et
dynamiques.
De
plus, avoir de beaux graphismes et un gameplay complet, c'est bien, mais il est
important d'avoir également des voix pour les personnages. L'idéale serait
d'avoir un doublage Japonais (et sous titré en différentes langues, comme de
bons fansubs !), compte tenu de l'univers du jeu.
Comme
chez Rykeï Studios, nous n'acceptons pas
de mettre un prix sur un jeu médiocre, la continuité du projet ne se fera que
si la somme demandée est atteinte. 
Sachez
également que si par bonheur, la campagne va au delà de toute attente, il y aura du contenu supplémentaire,
pour rendre l'expérience encore plus parfaite! (attention, pas en DLC, mais intégré directement dans le jeu !).
Et
si cela va au delà, mais vraiment vers l'infini (genre 100 000 Euros), les
consoles de salon pourront accueillir le jeu !

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","We share your passion for skateboarding, and that's why we know how you feel when you land that trick you've been trying for months.
We want to give you the opportunity to share your achievements with all your friends, those who are riding with you, and those who aren't. 
We've developed a device that comprises the latest in motion sensing technology and Bluetooth that allows our mobile Apps to identify which trick has been performed, and how well. That gives skaters the possibility to show their improvements, their goals and even play the famous S.K.A.T.E. game with people around the world without the need of being in the same geographical spot!



Sk8trakr identifies every time you perform a trick while you are riding, each trick is automatically recognized by the app and it gives you the name and a score based on how well you performed it. Since the detection is made in real time, you can check all that info right away!
With Sk8trakr you can save all your progress. Now you can check where and when you landed that sick trick that gave you lots of points. Now you can keep track of your improvement over time and check if those training sessions are working for you.




Sk8trakr is a gaming platform that lets you challenge other skaters and see who performs the best tricks or even play the famous game of S.K.A.T.E. in real time, just let Sk8trakr decide who is the best skater! There are a lot of game modes: 1 vs. 1, multiplayer, real time or deferred and several games: S.K.A.T.E., Best Trick, Own The Spot, Time Challange and others. There is also a global ranking of skaters.


The trick detection is performed via an electronic device (Trakr) that measures acceleration, rotation and magnetic field on three directions. The information gathered by the sensors is then transmitted to the mobile phone via Bluetooth to be processed. The mobile phone interprets the information and, using complex algorithms, detects the landed trick and scores it. 
The Trakr is attached between the trucks and the board  as if it was a regular pad. This location guarantees the integrity of the device in case you like hitting rails or boxes while you ride, and easy access, through a USB cable, to the rechargeable battery.





The team is composed by four engineers, all action sports fans with the necessary experience to build Sk8trakr. We have already worked with all the technology needed for this product. Our amazing partners, Wolox and GoodPeople are actively supporting the development of this product.


We have a working prototype of the tracking device (Trakr) and we are already manufacturing version 2, which will be just one step away from the pre-production version of Trakr. This upcoming version will allow us to test Trakr on tough conditions and perform the necessary tuning to design the production-ready version. We are also working close with an industrial designer to develop the manufacturable case.


Regarding the software, we have a working version of the detection algorithm and we are training our classification algorithms. We have assembled a team of professional skaters provided by GoodPeople to train the algorithm with new data. We were able to detect tricks with our first version of Trakr. We are now completing our data set so we can improve its performance.
Finally we have a first version of the UI of the iOS version of the mobile app. We are also working with Wolox’s Android team on the UI of the Android version.




Shipping outside the U.S. or Argentina is not included. Cost may vary between USD10 to USD15.
All the funders that apply for pre-production Trakr will be part of our test group. This means that every time we develop a new feature you will be the first one to test.


We've already spent more than U$D10.000 of our own money and we will continue doing so because we believe this project can bring the entire skateboarding community together. But we can't do it all by ourselves,  that's why we need you!
All of your money will go directly to the development and the go-to-production process, keep in mind that you're not just applying to the pre-order items, you are also helping Sk8trakr be available for everyone. We will use the money to design a production candidate for the case, pay for the production of 1000 testing devices, certificate the pre-production devices among other things.
We have a long way ahead, but we also have the motivation to get it done. With your help we will achieve our funding goal and make Sk8trakr a reality!

<p>Once a decade, the greatest huntsmen in the universe gather to compete in a legendary tournament known as the Blacksea Odyssey. Armed with only a spear and a harpoon, hunters must battle against creatures of colossal size and unimaginable terror. Using wit and skill, the huntsmen must identify the weaknesses of their foes in order to exploit them or die trying. Steeped in blood, ancient treasures, runic technologies, and a madness that wills them to enter deeper into the black abyss, these huntsman compete for a chance to claim the ultimate glory of facing a creature of such magnanimous size and insatiable ferocity that its wingspan has been said to stretch across galaxies while it’s breath consumes black holes; the Titan of the Stars! But does such a great huntsman exist….</p>

<p>Blacksea Odyssey is a 2D top-down shoot ’em up with RPG and rogue-like elements. It carries with it a blend between old school arcade shooters, newer RPGs, rogue-likes, and a modernized design with a heavy emphasis on replayability.</p>
<p>A vast sort of cumulative imagination has inspired us to create a dark and beautiful experience with lush otherworldly spacescapes, dangerous behemoths to rend, and a twitch-based stream of rapturous delight. With Blacksea Odyssey we wanted to create something truly original. While inspired by many of our favorite games, we believe our vision of Blacksea Odyssey separates itself from games of similar genres while still staying true to it’s core; a fast-paced space shooter. Imagine if you will Shadow of the Colossus’s massively scaled bosses, Geometry Wars extremely crisp and fluid control scheme, Path of Exile's deep RPG-like rune system, and Binding of Isaac's insane replayability. While many games have influenced the design of Blacksea Odyssey, these games have had the heaviest impact.</p>

<ul><li>Eviscerate your opponents with an onslaught of weapon loadouts and item customizations. Discover new weapon and ship runes to demolish your enemies with. Pick from an assortment of huntsmen each with their own unique characteristics to become the next great challenger in the Blacksea Odyssey.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Choose from a variety of spacescapes to explore. Each with their own unique set of creatures to hunt, mysteries to discover, and ancient runes to unearth. From character dialogues and the environment to enemy spawns and loot drops, everything in the game is procedurally generated and is affected by your choices. Travel deeper into the abyss at your own peril; the Blacksea is not for the feint of heart.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Prepare yourself for a steep difficulty curve. While picking up the game is fluid and easy in it’s earlier stages, the later parts require a mastery of mechanics both inside and out. Enemies become ferocious and unyielding, and bosses continue to adapt and grow until eventually becoming seemingly insurmountable. Intelligent strategy and fast reflexes will be required to overcome these colossal creatures.</li></ul>

<p><b>Spear -</b> The spear serves as your primary weapon and damage dealer. Four rune slots are engraved into every spear’s hilt. There, depending on the runes you have discovered, you can modify your spear to behave drastically different. Would you like to be an aggressive damage dealer with an emphasis on short quick bursts of fire? Or a sniper with magical enchantments focused on utility and long range combat?</p>

<p><b>Harpoon -</b> The harpoon is your secondary weapon and prime source of utility. Use it to eviscerate enemy creatures by ripping them apart piece by piece as you damage parts of it’s body. Also use it to latch onto enemies as they give you a ride all the while you slow them down with your harpoon. The longer you charge your harpoon, the more damage it deals and the faster it travels.</p>

<p><b>Evasive Maneuvering -</b> A rechargeable high-octane thruster offers extreme mobility. Depending on how the thruster is used it can behave differently, if timed correctly the thrusters offer a short, medium, or long boost great for out-maneuvering enemies in combat or evading them all together. The thrusters can be enhanced by various ship runes scattered throughout the galaxy. Your thrusters are pivotal to the game's core gameplay. While the spear is undoubtedly your sword, think of the thrusters as your shield.</p>

<p>The game is midway through production in an early alpha phase. We’ve completed all of the game’s framework as well as all of the game's core mechanics. We’ve finished many of the items that we want in the game as well as several biomes, bosses, and enemies. We've also had a decent amount of public play-testing and so far, we've gotten tons of positive feedback and excitement for the game!</p>
<p></p>

<p>The biggest task remaining is content generation; we have many enemies, items, bosses, biomes, and sound effects that still need to be designed, developed and implemented.</p>
<p>We believe the game’s alpha demo is in a fairly polished state and we feel that it accurately represents our vision for the game. So give it a try!</p>

Once a decade, the greatest huntsmen in the universe gather to compete in a legendary tournament known as the Blacksea Odyssey. Armed with only a spear and a harpoon, hunters must battle against creatures of colossal size and unimaginable terror. Using wit and skill, the huntsmen must identify the weaknesses of their foes in order to exploit them or die trying. Steeped in blood, ancient treasures, runic technologies, and a madness that wills them to enter deeper into the black abyss, these huntsman compete for a chance to claim the ultimate glory of facing a creature of such magnanimous size and insatiable ferocity that its wingspan has been said to stretch across galaxies while it’s breath consumes black holes; the Titan of the Stars! But does such a great huntsman exist….



The four great huntsman traverse through a crowd of cheering fans as they head to the space-docks to embark on their journey.


Blacksea Odyssey is a 2D top-down shoot ’em up with RPG and rogue-like elements. It carries with it a blend between old school arcade shooters, newer RPGs, rogue-likes, and a modernized design with a heavy emphasis on replayability.
A vast sort of cumulative imagination has inspired us to create a dark and beautiful experience with lush otherworldly spacescapes, dangerous behemoths to rend, and a twitch-based stream of rapturous delight. With Blacksea Odyssey we wanted to create something truly original. While inspired by many of our favorite games, we believe our vision of Blacksea Odyssey separates itself from games of similar genres while still staying true to it’s core; a fast-paced space shooter. Imagine if you will Shadow of the Colossus’s massively scaled bosses, Geometry Wars extremely crisp and fluid control scheme, Path of Exile's deep RPG-like rune system, and Binding of Isaac's insane replayability. While many games have influenced the design of Blacksea Odyssey, these games have had the heaviest impact.


Eviscerate your opponents with an onslaught of weapon loadouts and item customizations. Discover new weapon and ship runes to demolish your enemies with. Pick from an assortment of huntsmen each with their own unique characteristics to become the next great challenger in the Blacksea Odyssey.
Choose from a variety of spacescapes to explore. Each with their own unique set of creatures to hunt, mysteries to discover, and ancient runes to unearth. From character dialogues and the environment to enemy spawns and loot drops, everything in the game is procedurally generated and is affected by your choices. Travel deeper into the abyss at your own peril; the Blacksea is not for the feint of heart.
Prepare yourself for a steep difficulty curve. While picking up the game is fluid and easy in it’s earlier stages, the later parts require a mastery of mechanics both inside and out. Enemies become ferocious and unyielding, and bosses continue to adapt and grow until eventually becoming seemingly insurmountable. Intelligent strategy and fast reflexes will be required to overcome these colossal creatures.




 CORE MECHANICS


Spear - The spear serves as your primary weapon and damage dealer. Four rune slots are engraved into every spear’s hilt. There, depending on the runes you have discovered, you can modify your spear to behave drastically different. Would you like to be an aggressive damage dealer with an emphasis on short quick bursts of fire? Or a sniper with magical enchantments focused on utility and long range combat?


Harpoon - The harpoon is your secondary weapon and prime source of utility. Use it to eviscerate enemy creatures by ripping them apart piece by piece as you damage parts of it’s body. Also use it to latch onto enemies as they give you a ride all the while you slow them down with your harpoon. The longer you charge your harpoon, the more damage it deals and the faster it travels.


Evasive Maneuvering - A rechargeable high-octane thruster offers extreme mobility. Depending on how the thruster is used it can behave differently, if timed correctly the thrusters offer a short, medium, or long boost great for out-maneuvering enemies in combat or evading them all together. The thrusters can be enhanced by various ship runes scattered throughout the galaxy. Your thrusters are pivotal to the game's core gameplay. While the spear is undoubtedly your sword, think of the thrusters as your shield.


Consumables - You’ll come across a large variety of advanced weaponry, runic enchantments, and ancient items throughout your travels; hi-powered bombs, sentry guns, berserker potions, force fields and Thor’s Wrath - a fury of lightning bolts - just to name a few.


Runes - In the deepest parts of the galaxy, mythical enchantments from a time of ages past can be discovered scattered throughout the Blacksea. Huntsman use these enchantments to modify their weapons and ship. Mix and match various rune combinations to create the ultimate weapon. We currently have over 40 runes in the game and plan on having over 100. We expect a total of over a million different rune combinations to be possible by the game's completion.




Character Reveals
Each character has their own unique personality, dialogue, backstory, as well as spear and ship stats.


Enemy Reveals
Check out some enemies from our various biomes.






Boss Reveals









The game is midway through production in an early alpha phase. We’ve completed all of the game’s framework as well as all of the game's core mechanics. We’ve finished many of the items that we want in the game as well as several biomes, bosses, and enemies. We've also had a decent amount of public play-testing and so far, we've gotten tons of positive feedback and excitement for the game!


The biggest task remaining is content generation; we have many enemies, items, bosses, biomes, and sound effects that still need to be designed, developed and implemented.
We believe the game’s alpha demo is in a fairly polished state and we feel that it accurately represents our vision for the game. So give it a try!



Access to the Game
We plan to release on WIN/MAC/LINUX (DRM-Free and Steam). We also plan to pursue the consoles PS4/Xbox One.

Art Book


This illustrious beauty will contain all of the sprites, illustrations, and concepts, as well as specific details of the characters and galaxy. It will also reveal in finer detail some of the specific concepts behind design ideas as well as the realm in which these huntsman reside. Expect a lot of never revealed designs in here, as well as enemies, levels, and other biomes that never made it into the game. All for you to meander with in a fabulous display.
Boss Battle Instruction Booklet


 Remember the glory days of gaming when an instruction booklet meant something more meaningful? Well we want to bring it back with this epic boss battle instruction booklet. We promise it will be sent out before anyone has figured out the secrets to defeating these monstrosities. And now with this tool in hand you’ll be one of the first!
Old Man Pirate Skin


Receive a Kickstarter-only alternative skin for the main playable character to plunder the seven Blackseas with! Arrrrrrrr! Comes equipped with an anchor for a harpoon, gold teeth, a pirate themed space ship, and a pet parrot that follows the Old Man around.
Original Soundtrack

Limited Edition Poster  


An 18x24 legendary quality print of a huntsman doing battle in the Blacksea against a ferocious monster will be yours to do with as you please. Each one will be hand signed by our team members and numbered.
Design a species of Asterfish (enemy)


Ever want to bring your craziest fantasies to life? More specifically, your Blacksea fantasies? Maybe you wanted to blend a horse, with a shark, and a rocket launcher? Well now you can! And we’re perfectly okay with that combination too! Work with us to design the look, behavior, and name of three similar enemy creatures and we’ll give them a home in the Blacksea universe!
Design an Elderfish (boss)


Put your design skills to the test as we work with you to design your very own Elderfish boss that will be in the game. We'll help you bring your vision to life no matter how crazy it is, the more creative the more interested we are in it. Together we'll design how it appears visually, it’s behavior patterns, and how the player can kill it.
Design a Kingfish (super boss)


Have you ever dreamed of pummeling players to death with your borderline cruel or over the top design ideas? Ever imagine making an enemy that was ten times larger than the screenand shot fifteen laser beams at the same time, all the while being protected by a nearly impenetrable carapace? Well now we can help you bring your vision to life. Together we'll create one of the most epic and challenging experiences in gaming history. Whether it’s a massive crab with flaming claws or a unicorn with rainbows for hoofs, if you design it we’ll build it.

Huntsmen T-Shirt


Our lead artist Peter Milko will be making a design for a t-shirt once the Kickstarter is over. We'll create a poll with a few design ideas (feel free to add some of your own in the comments below) and work together to create the most strapping T-Shirt the Blacksea has ever seen. The shirt will be available in small, medium, large or extra large. It will also be available for purchase sometime after the Kickstarter as well.",53.0,1,"1 Campaign

The analog sticks will be made with a rubber casing in order to allow for a firm grip to stop your fingers from slipping off mid-game.How designs may differ from the prototype:The design for the Game Blox is certainly not the final design this is only the Mark 1 prototype and we will be making such changes as the plastic we used is called PLA however this will differ when this goes into full scale production. The labeling on the controller will be physically printed on rather than engraved.We hope to add items like rumble triggers and rubber grips on the back of the controller which may become stretch goals once the project is fully funded.We endeavor to make the triggers softer in order to allow you to play your favourite games seamlessly.Shipping:For all perks under and including £170 shipping will be charged at £15 per perk however if you would like to purchase more than on perk we would be happy to arrange this for you and the perks will be shipped as one package, therefore there will only be one shipping cost of £15.

Here's some that we've thought of:- you can use them as normal dice during the game: if they roll well, you can eat them out of joy, and if they don't, you can eat them as revenge! Just make sureno one else touches them ;)- you can use them as practical joke - in so many ways possible!- they will make a wonderful gift for your fellow gamer, girlfriend/boyfriend, or your Grandma who has always wanted to know what that ""gaming"" hobby of yoursis all about,- and, last but not least, for your own guilty pleasure!   Review the list of perks on the right-side of the campaign page. When you seea particular perk that you're interested in, click on it. This will have selectedthe perk for you to continue with the contribution check out process. Please note that if you select the ""Back It"" button, but don't add a perkto the transaction, you will only be donating funds in the amount you enter.If you intend to claim a perk, please be sure you choose the perk to go alongwith the transaction, before you complete your payment. If you like, you can choose more than one perk and make few separate contributions.After the campaign is over, we will send you the survey and ask you to specifywhich flavor and which design you’d like to get.   We are a small Polish company from Poznań. A couple of years ago we started making healthy sweets - the project was called Słodka Cytrynka (Polish for ""Sweet Lemon""). Our goal was to manufacture exceptional and healthy sweets,and to make them as technologically advanced as possible. We were able to develop a really broad range of products, always prioritizing the use of natural ingredients, healthy sugars and unusual flavors. And now we want to do this with you:- check out Candylize!Today, Candylize is a group of people passionate about making candy and eagerto use the most advanced production technologies. We are definitelyan “out of the box” thinkers, always looking for fresh ideas and new challenges. We’ve been testing the most innovative candy manufacturing technologiesfor years - and we believe that only sky is the limit! This project is very excitingfor us, as this is the first time that we’re trying to make ornamented and precise chocolate RPG dice. We hope that you can join us in this adventure!Q WORKSHOP, the company that has created the designs on the dice, is oneof the leading world manufacturers of ornamented RPG dice. Its distinctive designs and top-notch quality make them a point of reference when it comes to dice!Learn more about Q WORKSHOP here.Well, first we thought just about making edible RPG dice with the best quality.It seemed a logical step, especially after Q WORKSHOP had let us use their designs. And then, after we've looked closer at the crowdfunding possibilities, we realized that this is a great way to spread the word to more people! :)The money we want to gather thanks to the campaign will help us get better machines and maybe hire some extra people. More precisely, we want to buy some more advanced machines to make our sweet dice even more extraordinary.Also, if all goes well, we could buy a sorting machine for our candy - and be able to realize more orders more quickly. Isn't that exciting?    Our production facility is small, but it is fully compatible with all the health norms. Please mind however that the candy might contain some allergens like soja or nuts. If you are allergic to these ingredients, please do not order the dice for yourself. Here’s the full list of ingredients:  So, we think there's nothing left to add except...

for an organisation dealing with the transportation of handicapped 
people in Hamburg, Germany. One of the patients, a young blind woman 
said that the games he had created so far were not challenging enough 
for her. Johannes rose to the challenge posed, which eventually led to 
the creation and development of The Imhotep Labyrinth. We hope that this
 incident will now be beneficial to all blind and vision-impaired people
 all over the world.</p><p>

<p>Texas Hold'em can be a game of
wild swings of passion, with both crushing losing streaks
and exuberant runs of winning hands. The key thing that
separates the big-money winners from the losers isn't
passion, it's precision. Sadly for most of us, <i>precision
has always demanded serious mental discipline</i> and
<i>rigorous practice</i> beyond the reach of nearly all
casual players.</p>
<p>The online poker market is estimated
to exceed $5B USD in 2015 and during our research we
found that many poker tracking sites estimate that few people
play properly. In fact, even based on the most generous estimate for
correct play, at least two thirds of all the players are not playing correctly. This lack of precision costs these
players money and makes them targets for the professional
players who seek to capitalize on their
mistakes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/359714/files/20140209180832-JustLuck.png?1391998112"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Although luck determines the
hand you are dealt, the top players have spent years
developing the mental skills needed to calculate the odds of
improving that hand. So, as the song says, they know when to
hold'em and know when to fold 'em. While such mental prowess
is required for live play, online play provides a completely
different situation.</p>
<p>Online Texas Hold'em poker
is a lot of fun to play and like most card games <i>the odds
of winning are pretty good if played correctly</i>.
Similarly, it can be a frustrating venture if played ""by gut
feeling"" and a potential money sucking vacuum if played with
even one ""pro"" at the table. Many people who wouldn't
dream of setting foot in an live poker room are more than
willing to play online in anonymity where your mistakes are
hidden and free of embarrassment. The pro players 
scout the online tables looking for this kind of easy prey and use 
their knowledge of the game to intimidate players into folding 
a good hand or to goad them into betting on a hand where there's no reasonable chance of winning. </p>
<p>We don't think
that the game deserves to be dominated by a bunch of elitist
players with computer-like math skills and so we're
developing an alternative to level the playing
field.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/359715/files/20140209180856-AreThereWebsites.png?1391998136"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are a number
of websites out that that offer Texas Hold'em poker odds and
we've look at lots and lots of them. As we see it there are
two main problems with using these sites.</p>
<p>First, nearly all these sites 
are setup to deliver the <i>theoretical odds
and not the practical odds.</i> These web calculators are simply not comprehensive enough to
include all of the variables that occur during actual play 
that are critical to making the right decisions.</p>
<p>To calculate the practical
odds, one must perform multiple calculations to determine the
<i><b>real odds of improving a hand</b></i> based on the
<i><b>actual table conditions.</b></i> Plus, these
calculations need to be done four different times during every hand. Then, on every call/raise/fold choice another set of odds calculations called <i>pot odds</i> is needed to
determine the correct betting strategy. Trying to perform
all those different calculations during a live game, each of which can have
multiple sets of odds, is just not practical using websites.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/371355/files/20140215003102-FeelTheNeed.png?1392453062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>To make practical use of odds information during
online play both the data entry and the many, many
calculations need to be completed in mere seconds. Most web
calculators only work out one problem at a time, requiring
multiple uses to get a more complete set of odds. This leads to the second major
problem of using websites to try and do these calculations
... <b><i>speed</i></b>.</p>
<p>Online poker games give a player <i>very limited time to act</i> before a player's hand is
automatically forfeited. While a live poker game might
do only 30-60 hands per hour, online sites push for 100-120
hands per hour or higher. This is because the site makes money from
every hand played -- so faster play equals
more money for them. Since they make their money regardless
of who wins, the site operators have no real
interest in helping people play correctly but a vested
interest in making people play
quickly.</p>
<p><i><b>To solve the two key problems above, getting
the correct odds and getting them quickly enough to have
time to act on the information, we need to build a very

<p>The overall project goal is to develop an
application for a wide range of smartphone platforms
including nearly all iPhone, iPad, and Android phone and tablet implementations, with the
potential to include Windows Phone in future. That means
acquiring a fairly extensive range of equipment for
development and QA plus a major number crunching server that
chews on the data and spits out what we need. To keep initial costs under control we've decided that
the first development should focus on Apple IOS, allowing us to trim a substantial amount off the starting budget
requirements.</p>
<p>A project of this complexity should have a $150k-180k price tag, and a<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">t the normal rates for six
months of development the wage costs alone should easily exceed the entire project goal amount that we've set. However, we bribed
our team with liberal promises of pizza and diet-cola to get
the wage cost down to </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">less than a quarter</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of what it
should be. </span></p>
<p>In truth, there would be no wages in this project at all if any
of us could have actually afforded to work just for pizza, that's how much we believe in this product. Sadly, we can't pay rent and mortgages
with pepperoni and the development demands on this project
are so high that the team is going to have to forego any
side-jobs, so we need to pay for the dev time.That project staff took a large voluntary wage cut is a huge help and demonstrates<i> just how strongly the staff believes</i> in the success of this project. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/359721/files/20140209181030-Budget.png?1391998230"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In general, development hardware represents the largest portion 
of the budget, representing over a third of total expenses. Development 
wages and expenses, which includes the development software licenses 
and subscriptions, are the next highest budget item. Legal fees rounds 
out the top three expense categories. The overall
breakdown for the complete core development project is
summarized in the pie chart below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363051/files/20140211074034-HM_Budget.png?1392133234"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We're really hoping that after the lawyers are done with the
""necessities"" we will have enough left to make good on
the pizza we promised the development team.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/371812/files/20140215081554-Perks.png?1392480954"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To reward contributors we are
offering some very special perks at a variety of different
levels that should satisfy any budget. We're hoping that the
aggressive value we're putting in the perks helps get us all
the way to the funding goal.</p>
<p>Many of these
perks come with included usage credits, which requires a
little explanation. The operating model for the app is to
charge one usage credit per hand played; however, since the rate hasn't
been decided we want to make sure that our
contributors receive full value and have therefore made the
usage credits a dollar value and not a set number. The
actual usage credits received with the perk will be
calculated based on the per-hand charge in effect at product
launch. For example, if the rate were a half cent per
hand at launch, then you would receive 200 hands of play per
dollar of usage credit.</p>
<p>When we go to
Phase II the perks <i><b>will not be as valuable as the ones on this initial
launch</b></i>, so this is your chance to snag a really,
really juicy perk. <b>There are also several perks
that are limited edition or contain exclusive rewards. These
will be offered only during this campaign and will not be
available elsewhere when this campaign is finished.</b> Standard shipping, where required, is
included to any North American destination; international
destinations requiring special shipping or special customs
handling <i>might</i> require a small shipping fee, it
depends on the perk.</p>

<p>If you are like us, fans of Texas Hold'em
who believe that online poker should be a level playing
field and not the sole domain of elite players, then this is
the project for you, and your relatives, and your friends, heck
anyone you can think of -- please spread the word! As we say
in the videos, <i>Why just
play, when you can play to win!""</i></p></div>","Texas Hold'em can be a game of
wild swings of passion, with both crushing losing streaks
and exuberant runs of winning hands. The key thing that
separates the big-money winners from the losers isn't
passion, it's precision. Sadly for most of us, precision
has always demanded serious mental discipline and
rigorous practice beyond the reach of nearly all
casual players.
The online poker market is estimated
to exceed $5B USD in 2015 and during our research we
found that many poker tracking sites estimate that few people
play properly. In fact, even based on the most generous estimate for
correct play, at least two thirds of all the players are not playing correctly. This lack of precision costs these
players money and makes them targets for the professional
players who seek to capitalize on their
mistakes.


Although luck determines the
hand you are dealt, the top players have spent years
developing the mental skills needed to calculate the odds of
improving that hand. So, as the song says, they know when to
hold'em and know when to fold 'em. While such mental prowess
is required for live play, online play provides a completely
different situation.
Online Texas Hold'em poker
is a lot of fun to play and like most card games the odds
of winning are pretty good if played correctly.
Similarly, it can be a frustrating venture if played ""by gut
feeling"" and a potential money sucking vacuum if played with
even one ""pro"" at the table. Many people who wouldn't
dream of setting foot in an live poker room are more than
willing to play online in anonymity where your mistakes are
hidden and free of embarrassment. The pro players 
scout the online tables looking for this kind of easy prey and use 
their knowledge of the game to intimidate players into folding 
a good hand or to goad them into betting on a hand where there's no reasonable chance of winning. 
We don't think
that the game deserves to be dominated by a bunch of elitist
players with computer-like math skills and so we're
developing an alternative to level the playing
field.


There are a number
of websites out that that offer Texas Hold'em poker odds and
we've look at lots and lots of them. As we see it there are
two main problems with using these sites.
First, nearly all these sites 
are setup to deliver the theoretical odds
and not the practical odds. These web calculators are simply not comprehensive enough to
include all of the variables that occur during actual play 
that are critical to making the right decisions.
To calculate the practical
odds, one must perform multiple calculations to determine the
real odds of improving a hand based on the
actual table conditions. Plus, these
calculations need to be done four different times during every hand. Then, on every call/raise/fold choice another set of odds calculations called pot odds is needed to
determine the correct betting strategy. Trying to perform
all those different calculations during a live game, each of which can have
multiple sets of odds, is just not practical using websites.

To make practical use of odds information during
online play both the data entry and the many, many
calculations need to be completed in mere seconds. Most web
calculators only work out one problem at a time, requiring
multiple uses to get a more complete set of odds. This leads to the second major
problem of using websites to try and do these calculations
... speed.
Online poker games give a player very limited time to act before a player's hand is
automatically forfeited. While a live poker game might
do only 30-60 hands per hour, online sites push for 100-120
hands per hour or higher. This is because the site makes money from
every hand played -- so faster play equals
more money for them. Since they make their money regardless
of who wins, the site operators have no real
interest in helping people play correctly but a vested
interest in making people play
quickly.
To solve the two key problems above, getting
the correct odds and getting them quickly enough to have
time to act on the information, we need to build a very
special smartphone application.


The overall project goal is to develop an
application for a wide range of smartphone platforms
including nearly all iPhone, iPad, and Android phone and tablet implementations, with the
potential to include Windows Phone in future. That means
acquiring a fairly extensive range of equipment for
development and QA plus a major number crunching server that
chews on the data and spits out what we need. To keep initial costs under control we've decided that
the first development should focus on Apple IOS, allowing us to trim a substantial amount off the starting budget
requirements.
A project of this complexity should have a $150k-180k price tag, and at the normal rates for six
months of development the wage costs alone should easily exceed the entire project goal amount that we've set. However, we bribed
our team with liberal promises of pizza and diet-cola to get
the wage cost down to less than a quarter of what it
should be. 
In truth, there would be no wages in this project at all if any
of us could have actually afforded to work just for pizza, that's how much we believe in this product. Sadly, we can't pay rent and mortgages
with pepperoni and the development demands on this project
are so high that the team is going to have to forego any
side-jobs, so we need to pay for the dev time.That project staff took a large voluntary wage cut is a huge help and demonstrates just how strongly the staff believes in the success of this project. 


In general, development hardware represents the largest portion 
of the budget, representing over a third of total expenses. Development 
wages and expenses, which includes the development software licenses 
and subscriptions, are the next highest budget item. Legal fees rounds 
out the top three expense categories. The overall
breakdown for the complete core development project is
summarized in the pie chart below.

We're really hoping that after the lawyers are done with the
""necessities"" we will have enough left to make good on
the pizza we promised the development team.

To reward contributors we are
offering some very special perks at a variety of different
levels that should satisfy any budget. We're hoping that the
aggressive value we're putting in the perks helps get us all
the way to the funding goal.
Many of these
perks come with included usage credits, which requires a
little explanation. The operating model for the app is to
charge one usage credit per hand played; however, since the rate hasn't
been decided we want to make sure that our
contributors receive full value and have therefore made the
usage credits a dollar value and not a set number. The
actual usage credits received with the perk will be
calculated based on the per-hand charge in effect at product
launch. For example, if the rate were a half cent per
hand at launch, then you would receive 200 hands of play per
dollar of usage credit.
When we go to
Phase II the perks will not be as valuable as the ones on this initial
launch, so this is your chance to snag a really,
really juicy perk. There are also several perks
that are limited edition or contain exclusive rewards. These
will be offered only during this campaign and will not be
available elsewhere when this campaign is finished. Standard shipping, where required, is
included to any North American destination; international
destinations requiring special shipping or special customs
handling might require a small shipping fee, it
depends on the perk.






Ace High$5

Ever wanted to see
your name in lights, well here's your chance! You'll receive
recognition on our website and social media pages as a
founding supporter of the project, plus you'll receive a
free copy of the app with usage credits with a minimum value
of $20. That's a 4x return on your contribution -- proof that
sometimes in poker even an Ace-high hand can win!






Pair$10

Sometimes a pair is
all it takes to be a winner, so you'll receive recognition
on our website and social media pages as a founding
supporter of the project. Additionally, you'll receive a
free copy of the app loaded up with usage credits with a
minimum value of $50. That's a 5x return on your
contribution!






Two Pair$25

Two is better
than one, so this perk not only includes recognition on our
website and social media pages as a founding supporter, but
also comes with up to two free copies of the app and a pool
of usage credits valued at $250. You can split the pool
between the copies any way you want, or you can choose to
load all $250 of credits on one copy.






Trips$100

Three's not a crowd when it comes to perks.
First, you'll receive recognition on our website and social
media pages as a founding supporter. Next, you also receive
up to three copies of the app with a shared pool of usage
credits with a minimum value of $1,200 to divide as you see
fit between the copies. Finally, we'll also throw in a set
of three custom can coolers to hold your frosty beverage of 
choice during those long play sessions.
Pictures of the coolers
will be posted once the artwork has been completed so you'll
be able to see exactly what your getting and we think you'll
be more than pleased.







Straight$250

Keeping things in order earns you some
excellent perks. First, in addition to the standard
recognition on our website and social media pages, you will
receive premium recognition right in the app. Plus you get
up to five copies of the app with a shared pool of usage
credits valued at $5,000 to divide as you see fit between
the copies. Don't feel like sharing? No problem, load your
copies with any mix of credits you see fit from $0 to the
full $5000.
You'll also receive our EXCLUSIVE custom
Hold'em Master Premium Cotton Ring-Spun Fleece Hoodie
(available in sizes Small through 2X) to show off your
status as a premium supporter. This special Premium
Supporter Hoodie is being produced only for perk rewards on
this campaign, so when the perks are gone so are the
hoodies. We'll be posting pictures for all to see once the
artwork has been completed but rest assured you won't be
disappointed.







Flush$500


You prefer things to match and we get that. First, in addition to the
standard recognition on our website and social media pages,
you will receive premium recognition right in the app.
You'll match that with up to five free copies of the app
with a shared pool of five years of unlimited
play usage credits to divide as you see fit between
the copies. If you were to play only four hours per week,
this usage credit adds up to over $5,000; however, because it's
unlimited play the potential value of this perk is staggering.

Unlimited play credit is available
EXCLUSIVELY though these perks and will not be offered to
the general public at launch. So, if you are a dedicated
poker player (or know someone who is) than this is your
chance to score $10,000, $50,000, or even $100,000+ in value
from one simple contribution.





Full House$1,000


A potent hand with a potent perk.
Naturally, premium recognition right in the app is
included as a starter. Next, three free copies of the app to
distribute as you see fit, each copy with unlimited usage
credits matched with two bonus copies of the app, each with
two years of unlimited usage credits.

If you play for only four hours a week, over the first 
two years this
usage credit is worth at least $2,000. The three copies of
the app continue, however, to accumulate value every year
for the life of the app. With even minimal play this perk
could be worth $10,000 or more in no time at all.
To top
things off we'll give you three custom coffee mugs and two
custom can coolers (or the other way around, your choice) to
handle your hot or cold beverage of choice while you enjoy
your unlimited play








The following perks are exclusive, quantity limited rewards. When these perks have sold out they will not be offered again on this or any future Hold'em Master campaign.









Four-of-a-Kind$5,000Limited to only FOUR availableIncludes multi-year donation to your favourite registered charity



We like to think that great things come in
fours.


Premier recognition for you, plus
a plug for your favourite registered charity included
in-app, on our webpage, and on our social media
pages.
Four app copies to share, or keep some
and donate the rest to a charity auction
Each copy
comes with unlimited usage credit for the life of the
app so any copies you donate to charity won't
have to worry about hidden costs
For the first four
years after launch, one fourth of one percent (0.25%)
royalty on the net profits per year paid to you, with a
matching amount donated to your selected
registered charity. 



If you played only four hours per week, the usage credit alone
is valued at almost $4,000 in the first four
years.








Straight Flush$10,000Limited to only FOUR availableIncludes ROYALTY PAYMENTS



Getting a straight
flush is all about being in-the-money, so you receive a
royalty of 5% of the operating profits for the lifetime of
the app to a maximum of $100,000. We'll also throw in all of
the non-monetary benefits included on any lower
perk.
The application benefits and the royalty payment
in this perk results in at least a ten-fold
return on investment (1000%).








Royal Flush$25,000Exclusive only ONE availableIncludes ROYALTY PAYMENTS




Hitting the Royal Flush means a big payout and when it comes to perks this one is no exception. Your
contribution earns you a 15% royalty of the operating
profits for the lifetime of the app to a maximum of
$500,000.
We'll fly you to Ontario where
you'll be our guest for the 2-day launch event. You'll have
a chance to meet-n-greet the development team during a
special cocktail and dinner and be recognized in person at
the event as a truly special contributor.
The royalty
in this perk represents a staggering twenty-fold
return (2000%) but we're still going to throw in all
of the non-monetary rewards included in all of the lower
perks.








Tournament Champion$100,000Singular Ultra Exclusive Opportunity!!!



There can be only one -- one very
exclusive perk for one very special long term partner.
Contributing at this level automatically makes you a winner
in our books, but this is your opportunity to join the
exclusive club of those who've made a million on
poker!
Your investment in this project earns you a
royalty of 20% of the operating profits for the life of the
app with no maximum cap. Given the expected lifespan of the
application and the conservative projections on in-app sales
revenues, we're estimating a least a minimum 40x
return on investment! That means a return of
$2,000,000 without the bother of sitting in a sweaty, smelly
poker tournament room for a week.
You're invited to
our mid-project status meeting that will occur approximately
90-days into development. If you decide to take advantage of
that invite, we'll fly you to Ontario where you'll be our
guest for the day and have the opportunity to participate in
the team discussions, and we'll cap off the day with a
post-meeting dinner at one of the fabulous local
restaurants.
When it's time for the launch, we'll fly
you to Ontario to be our special guest for the 2-day launch
event. You'll be receiving premier contributor recognition
during the keynote speech at the launch ceremony and be the
guest of honor at a special cocktail and dinner event on the
evening of the first day. Then, just so you'll have some
nice souvenirs, we'll also throw in all of the non-monetary
rewards included in all of the lower perk
levels.


We picked the fixed funding
method so that we could be assured of having the resources
for completing the first phase of development on the IOS 
version. Also, because the perks contain free usage credits for the
application, delivery on those valuable credits requires a
completed product so we need to be sure we can
deliver. This also protects you, the contributor, in that your contribution is fully refunded if the project doesn't reach goal and launch.
We've already started working on the
algorithms and user interface designs, since that work is largely time
and effort on our part and the costs are low enough that
we're able to cover these out-of-pocket.
We'll be
posting images and videos over the next 60 days as the
campaign continues so that all our contributors, current and
prospective, can get a better feel for the application and
the development process. We'll also be posting previews of
the perk items as soon as the graphics are
finished.
Once the application hits production release the
planned revenue stream will make maintenance, updates, and
continued development for new devices largely
self-sustaining. However, we need your help to get to over
the first hurdle to get working and get to that that launch
stage as quickly as possible so we can move on to adding
Android support and then the Phase II premium online 
analysis components.
If you are like us, fans of Texas Hold'em
who believe that online poker should be a level playing
field and not the sole domain of elite players, then this is
the project for you, and your relatives, and your friends, heck
anyone you can think of -- please spread the word! As we say
in the videos, Why just
play, when you can play to win!""",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h4>The Game</h4>
<p>Fortuna Sphera is Latin: fortuna meaning fate or fortune,
and sphera meaning sphere or orb. Which translates to Sphere of Fate.</p>
<p>Fortuna Sphera was created to be a simple yet unlimited
tabletop/LARP style role playing game for players of any age. Since most
standard tabletop RPG’s are complex and grand in scope, they do not lend well
to young children. So we thought: What if there were a game that we can play
with our children that taps into their imaginations and still has the basic function
of a role playing game? A game that lets a player be what or whoever they want
to be instead of being locked into a given genre? A game not weighed down (literally)
with rule books and sheets of information to keep track of?</p>
<p>Fortuna Sphera is that game.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463032423/3balls_1000x_geynqx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
(these are some of the early versions)<br/><br/>
<p>The sphere itself is based on an idea that you likely
already know. We use it in a new way, making a game that is very easy to play.
Inside the orb is a 20 sided dice that floats in a dark fluid. When a player
needs to determine the result of a task or action they need only give their orb
a shake turn it over and read the result.</p>
<p>One or four results will appear: Success, Failure, Grand
Success, or Grand Failure. A Grand result is akin to a Critical.</p>

<br/>
<p>The intended use for Fortuna Sphera, is that it can easily be
added into any story line or universe imaginable. That way parents can easily
engage their children in a game using their favorite cartoon or movie as the
backdrop. At the same time more advanced role players can play in a world being
generated on the fly. But what role playing game doesn’t have its own story?</p>

<h4>The Campaign</h4>
<p>Our primary goal of $25,000 usd, is the bare minimum we need
to make Fortuna Sphera a reality. This Covers equipment, materials, and
training for making the first batch of orbs. To us, this campaign is not just
about Fortuna Sphera it’s for Conflict Games as a whole. Should this goal be
met, stretch goals will include multi language support for the game, much
needed hardware and software upgrades, and more. When you support this campaign
you are supporting the future of Conflict Games. </p>
<p>To keep things interesting we will offer a number of
campaign exclusive designs. The first 1000 spheres will have an exclusive
design. Should they all be claimed, the next design will run for 2000. The
third and beyond will have a run of 3000. No matter how well this campaign does
supporters will always get an exclusive design but the earlier you jump in, the
more limited the design will be. The current design will be added as an update
as well as a peek at the next design in line. We will do our utmost to keep the running design as current as possible, but please be understanding if we cannot update immediately. <br/></p>

<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<p>We are a small company, in fact there are only the two of us. 
Currently we operate out of our small home offices. Upon the success of 
this campaign we will have our work cut out for us. Setting up a place 
to work and procuring the equipment we will need is only the start. 
After that comes producing Fortuna Sphera. <br/></p>
<p>We will receive orbs from the manufacturer 
as a solid color with no designs on them. The patterns and designs will 
be added by us directly. While we have most of the bugs worked out of 
the process in small scale, our method for applying the 
process in great numbers will require streamlining as we progress. This means it might take a while to to produce 
them.</p>
<br/>
<h4>The Company</h4>
<p>Conflict Games was founded on June 26, 2015 in a small town
in Western Montana.  It is our goal to
provide quality original games of all kinds. We have a number of projects in
various stages of development, from tabletop and board games, to mobile apps
and video games.</p>
<p>We are currently only a staff of two. We are a small company, but we have some great ideas. A few of which we hope to launch in the next year or two.  If you would like to keep current with us we post all important news on the website, and Facebook.</p>

Inside the orb is a 20 sided dice that floats in a dark fluid. When a player
needs to determine the result of a task or action they need only give their orb
a shake turn it over and read the result.
One or four results will appear: Success, Failure, Grand
Success, or Grand Failure. A Grand result is akin to a Critical.



    

The intended use for Fortuna Sphera, is that it can easily be
added into any story line or universe imaginable. That way parents can easily
engage their children in a game using their favorite cartoon or movie as the
backdrop. At the same time more advanced role players can play in a world being
generated on the fly. But what role playing game doesn’t have its own story?
Meet the Carrolls’:




A normal British family. That is, until they found their
Fortuna Sphera and things changed dramatically. The Collector has come looking
for them and he won’t stop until he has gathered all of the Fortuna Sphera for
himself.



The story so far can be read here.



A sphere is roughly the size of a baseball, making it easy
to hold for hands of almost any age. It requires no batteries, so it can be
used anywhere you might want to have a game. They will be offered in a variety
of designs and colors so you can find the one that fits you or your character.
Since the game can easily be played with the orb alone, they become perfect
props for a LARP. 
The rules fit on one side of a business card, which also
doubles as the ""character sheet"" for pickup and dropout games or
large games with many players who may not know each other.

The Campaign
Our primary goal of $25,000 usd, is the bare minimum we need
to make Fortuna Sphera a reality. This Covers equipment, materials, and
training for making the first batch of orbs. To us, this campaign is not just
about Fortuna Sphera it’s for Conflict Games as a whole. Should this goal be
met, stretch goals will include multi language support for the game, much
needed hardware and software upgrades, and more. When you support this campaign
you are supporting the future of Conflict Games. 
To keep things interesting we will offer a number of
campaign exclusive designs. The first 1000 spheres will have an exclusive
design. Should they all be claimed, the next design will run for 2000. The
third and beyond will have a run of 3000. No matter how well this campaign does
supporters will always get an exclusive design but the earlier you jump in, the
more limited the design will be. The current design will be added as an update
as well as a peek at the next design in line. We will do our utmost to keep the running design as current as possible, but please be understanding if we cannot update immediately. 
Current Design:



The family pack, (also a campaign exclusive), are designed
after the set of spheres the Carroll family uses. Their designs will only be
available during this campaign, and will be limited in number to the amount of supporters
that select the Genus perk.


   

At the moment we are only able to ship to the United States. When we find a shipping method with reasonable pricing we will expand to more areas. Apologies for any inconvenience.


The Challenge
We are a small company, in fact there are only the two of us. 
Currently we operate out of our small home offices. Upon the success of 
this campaign we will have our work cut out for us. Setting up a place 
to work and procuring the equipment we will need is only the start. 
After that comes producing Fortuna Sphera. 
We will receive orbs from the manufacturer 
as a solid color with no designs on them. The patterns and designs will 
be added by us directly. While we have most of the bugs worked out of 
the process in small scale, our method for applying the 
process in great numbers will require streamlining as we progress. This means it might take a while to to produce 
them.

The Company
Conflict Games was founded on June 26, 2015 in a small town
in Western Montana.  It is our goal to
provide quality original games of all kinds. We have a number of projects in
various stages of development, from tabletop and board games, to mobile apps
and video games.
We are currently only a staff of two. We are a small company, but we have some great ideas. A few of which we hope to launch in the next year or two.  If you would like to keep current with us we post all important news on the website, and Facebook.
Our news page is here.

The Staff



Andrew Nickerson – Founder/Writer – Andrew is a longtime fan
of games of all kinds. From playing the Robotech RPG as a kid to playing
Fallout 4 as a much older kid. He started designing pen and paper RPG’s from
scratch at the age of 12 to play with his friends, and he never stopped. 



Eden Vermilion – Artist – Eden has been an artist as long as
she can remember and a gamer from a very young age. Often these two passions
would intertwine as she loved to draw characters from the games she played.
This led her to pursue a career drawing characters of her own. Eden is also an
avid lover of cosplay, anime conventions, and fried rice.


The Schedule
This is a first for us so though we will do everything in our power to keep this schedule, there may be delays. If there are we will update this page as well as our own news pages. Of course we will also update if everything is going to plan to keep you in the loop.June - The campaign ends.July - We begin ordering equipment and materials.August - Production begins.October - Begin shipping Fortuna Sphera to campaign supporters.December - Fortuna Sphera available through the Conflict Games store.

<h3>Big Coins for Big Bois</h3>
<p>I don't know about y'all, but I've had a blast playing Classic with our guild. Fun times, fun people. I want to have a real life memento of this shit. An Official Real Life Guild Coin™. It'd be pretty baller, and we pretty baller.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds to make this happen. Depending on how much money we raise, we'll have a few options of what we're getting.</p>
<p>If this actually gets funded, the design of the coin will be put to a vote in our Discord. It might be as simple as a 1"" 1-color coin with raised areas or a 3"" fully colored, numbered shit, depending on funds.</p>
<p>We're probably going to order at least 100 coins to lower the cost per piece and be sure that everyone gets one. Probably a minimum of 300$ with shipping and everything factored in, but Indiegogo requires 500$ minimum for funding.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's not many challenges I can see if it gets funded.</p>
<p>If your coin gets lost in the mail, we should be able to send you another one, since we'll be buying them in bulk.</p>
<p>Don't want ya boi Conmo to know your address cause he might show up with a bottle of plastic vodka? Get a PO box or some shit</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>So this shit ain't happening for real, but if we somehow get way more money than expected then we'll have another vote on what to do with it. Official Guild Member Certificates™? Donate it to a park or something to get it named after the guild? There's a park in Scotland you can donate to and officially own a 1'x1' plot of land, technically making us all Lords and Ladies. Name a star? Idk, we'll vote if shit gets insane funding.</p>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE: To help build interest in my campaign I have written a free, downloadable mini-adventure for people to try out. Head on over to <a href=""http://penandforge.ca/index.asp?page=6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""PDF link"">my site</a> for your copy.</strong><br/></em></p>
<p><em>Path of Legends</em> is a new choose-your-own-adventure series with a refined <strong>OSRIC-compatible</strong> adventure system that has a minimal learning time but covers the most used aspects of old school gaming. In no time you’ll be hunting for enchanted items, battling goblins, rat-men and other creatures, enhancing your combat with a variety of potions and solving puzzles with deadly traps. Best of all, the character that you create, level up and spend time building in this adventure can be used continually in all of the <em>Path of Legends</em> books as you travel the path to becoming a living legend.</p>
<p>Why a new choose-your-own-adventure series after all this time, you ask? I feel that the older ones were lacking in the delivery and quality of a true adventure the way that traditional gamers expect, and none had successfully used a simple yet satisfying OSRIC system. This series will deliver that. It is also apparent that many budding gamers miss out on the chance to run through a good adventure since good Game Masters are hard to find in many communities. This series fills that need by covering every detail along the way so that the reader can focus on enjoying the story that they are taking part in.</p>
<p>Included in the book is a detailed Codex with character sheets, various word puzzles, and an illustrated guide of the treasures you can find. And since every <em>Path of Legends</em> book comes with a full set of custom-made polyhedron dice, all you need to supply is a your adventurer’s spirit and a pencil.</p>
<p>Despite the obvious gaming attributes of this project, I was inspired to write a story that was both enjoyable and suitable for all ages to read, from the juvenile to the adult reading level, that wasn't completely dependent on the  combat system. Reading is an adventure in itself, and the younger the reader, the bigger the adventure can be! In fact, it will be possible to enjoy the entire <em>Path of Legends</em> book series without any dice at all. The reader can still play the part of the hero, solving puzzles and making decisions, all the while going on the pretense that the hero will be victorious no matter what the odds. Isn't that what a good book is all about for many readers? This isn't a collection of random events being sold as a story, like the older books of this style, but a full-fledged novel that the reader interacts with. That being said, in acknowledgement of the many young readers who often find themselves left out of a good adventure for financial reasons, I would like to see as many of my books as possible be donated to your local libraries. See Perk #1 to help make this possible.</p>
<p>So whether you long for the good ol' days of sword-swinging with minimal complications, or you've been dying to try it but can't find anyone to play with, this is the solo adventure for you. In fact, you could even run the adventure with 2 characters and read through it together, as long as you each have a book and decide who's going to be the lead hero. Just be ready to share the treasure.</p>

If it happens, each book will come with a different bunch of random Dwarven Battle Dice (1 bunch = 10 dice), then it's up to you to battle other gamers who have ventured into the Lost City of the Dwarves and grow your collection. So tell everyone you know about this, because it wouldn't be much fun if you were the only one around with this wicked new dice game.

<p><strong>Our Objective-</strong> To bring gamers of every kind into one place where they can enjoy the casual and competitive side of the gaming community. Giving gamers the chance to experience the excitement and atmosphere of Pro status. And last but not least, a place where gamers can show off what they do best, have fun and make new friends while doing it :)</p>
<p><strong>Raising The Funds-</strong>We are raising funds to fill our center with 24 x 22'' Monitors for crisp image gaming (allowing eight teams of four to play at once), 24 x Xbox 360's to serve all the gaming needs and 15 x Stereo sound gaming headsets to get you closer to all of the action. We also need to fill our center with the latest and up to date Sports, Fighter and FPS games. The most exciting part about this project is Main Stage. This is where players are made. 2 x 50'' projection screens will show off tournament play for a cheering and admiring audience. During tournament off days (mon-fri) the main stage can be used by anyone who wants to game. This gives gamers the sensation and thrill of feeling like a pro. Show off your skills on the big screens:) The screens will be powered by two crystal projection units allowing the best picture possible. We will need pump main stage's sound out to send the crowd into a cheering frenzy. That's where the Yorkville mixer and PA system come into play, to make sure the audience can feel every hit, goal and kill.</p>
<p><strong>Tournaments-</strong> When we are up and running we will be holding tournaments every weekend for prizes and status. There will be singles, doubles and teams of four tournaments in the latest sports, fighter and FPS games. Tournaments give gamers a chance at prizes, status and also a chance to get a sponsorship. This is where a player can experience what it takes on the road  to become a champion.</p>
<p><strong>The Lounge-</strong>This is a place where gamers can take a break from the intense world of competitive gaming to chill out and relax. Play classic arcade titles  from Donkey Kong to Pacman or grab a bud and a N64 and chill out with Mario Kart. Relax on our sofa's and refuel with some snacks and energy drinks.The only rules in the lounge are to relax and have fun.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong>- When we are stable we will be taking the gaming experience to you. Traveling all across Canada and the United states. This will allow us to reach gamers all over the continent and take the North American Gaming League to new and exciting heights.</p>

<p><strong>With your help we can take gaming to the next level.</strong></p></div>","Hey guys, Eric here informing you all about the North American Gaming League. It's a Toronto, Canada based Lan/Arcade center for professional, semi-professional, amateur and casual gamers.
Our Objective- To bring gamers of every kind into one place where they can enjoy the casual and competitive side of the gaming community. Giving gamers the chance to experience the excitement and atmosphere of Pro status. And last but not least, a place where gamers can show off what they do best, have fun and make new friends while doing it :)
Raising The Funds-We are raising funds to fill our center with 24 x 22'' Monitors for crisp image gaming (allowing eight teams of four to play at once), 24 x Xbox 360's to serve all the gaming needs and 15 x Stereo sound gaming headsets to get you closer to all of the action. We also need to fill our center with the latest and up to date Sports, Fighter and FPS games. The most exciting part about this project is Main Stage. This is where players are made. 2 x 50'' projection screens will show off tournament play for a cheering and admiring audience. During tournament off days (mon-fri) the main stage can be used by anyone who wants to game. This gives gamers the sensation and thrill of feeling like a pro. Show off your skills on the big screens:) The screens will be powered by two crystal projection units allowing the best picture possible. We will need pump main stage's sound out to send the crowd into a cheering frenzy. That's where the Yorkville mixer and PA system come into play, to make sure the audience can feel every hit, goal and kill.
Tournaments- When we are up and running we will be holding tournaments every weekend for prizes and status. There will be singles, doubles and teams of four tournaments in the latest sports, fighter and FPS games. Tournaments give gamers a chance at prizes, status and also a chance to get a sponsorship. This is where a player can experience what it takes on the road  to become a champion.
The Lounge-This is a place where gamers can take a break from the intense world of competitive gaming to chill out and relax. Play classic arcade titles  from Donkey Kong to Pacman or grab a bud and a N64 and chill out with Mario Kart.

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>The following is a preview that gives you an idea about the look and feel of the game in just over 1,5 min: </p>

<h3>Less garbage, more branding &amp; Fun!</h3>
<p>With this project we want to create a type of merchandise that is better for the <b>environment</b>. That can replace the plastic gimmicks that are trashed in truckloads at conferences around the world. To create something that can be <b>scarce, unique and valuable while inexpensive</b>, something produced from renewable resources. All our cards will be printed on certified FSC cardboard (a label for responsible forest management that is awarded by FSC, a global not-for-profit that defines best practices that address both social and environmental issues in forestry <a href=""http://www.fsc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>www.fsc.org</a>).</p>
<p>Give Us Cards! is the blueprint for a <b>collectible deck building card game</b>, with cards you can collect when you participate in community events or when you contribute to certain campaigns. It is a <b>fun geeky card game</b> that you can play with your friends, family and customers.</p>
<p>With it we want to build a shared community playground in which organizations can <b>creatively rival</b> each other with over-the-top cards that celebrate their contributions to the community. At the same time, it makes our individual marketing efforts part of a much larger project that will build <b>a shared marketing resource</b>. A tool that is bigger than anything any individual company can do, that furthers the goals of our community as a whole.</p>
<p>Through collaboration our communities have built better software at lower costs, collaboratively we can make conference giveaways that generate greater <b>longer lasting brand interactions</b> for less money, that can be used to <b>educate people about open source</b>, its communities and the things we celebrate.</p>

<p>Open source projects wouldn't exist without all the amazing people that have given so much of themselves to make our communities happen. </p>
<p>If you like what you see here, and you want to help us promote the game and at the same time say thank you to someone important in your community, take part in our <b>pay it forward campaign</b>. It’s free, all you need to do is to click on one of the below links and fill in the Twitter handle of someone you know that you would like to give a free card.</p>

<p>Use the appropriate hashtag to tell us who should get the reward. You can nominate as many people as you want, but you can only vote once for the same person. In case there are more people nominated than we have cards we will send cards to nominees in order of the number of people that have tweet-voted for them. A tie will be broken based on the date of a nominee's first tweet-vote. Tweet-voting for all 5 free card campaigns will close on the deadline of the crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p><em>Important: As with all our other perks, also the social media perks will only be printed and distributed if we reach our minimum campaign target.</em></p>

<h3>Get it started</h3>
<p>To make this all possible we need your help: </p>
<p>We need <b>enough individual contributions</b> to convince even the more conservative organizations that there is a large number of people in the community that will get excited about a card game that replaces more traditional non-renewable merchandise; To prove that people want to collect unique cards about the projects they are involved in; That our game is appealing enough to invest in for an upcoming conference.</p>
<p>We also need an initial group of <b>organizational backers who want to be pioneers</b> with us and who want to help create a fun marketing resource for the wider open source community that lets people experience first hand why it makes more sense to collaborate with a community than to build in isolation.</p>
<p><b>This is an all or nothing campaign</b>: if we don’t at least reach our basic funding target, we will publish what we already created but we won’t be able to continue working on this project. If the project can’t rally a minimal support from the community it won’t make sense to keep on investing in it.</p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Give Us Cards is in the first place an <b>open source project</b>, anyone who’s interested can join the project. Soon you will be able to download a printable bare bones play deck (nothing fancy just functional) to help us test play the rules of our game. We want to work together with you, our community, to make an open standard that anyone can use to create a deck, extension pack or even a single card, that will be compatible with our game. If you are interested we would very much appreciate any feedback that can help us improve the rules of the game, true open source style.</p>
<p>The Give Us Cards IndieGoGo campaign is run by Pronovix, a 20 people strong software consulting company based in Belgium and Hungary that’s an active contributor to the Drupal project. We are really passionate about the open source movement, and it’s community. That is why we want to further enrich the ecosystem with a collaborative marketing tool like the Give Us Cards project.</p>
<p>We previously did a successful IndieGoGo campaign for making better documentation tool for online software. We have fulfilled our campaign perk promises and the project looks like it is going to be a major success story, To find out more check out our campaign site at <a href=""http://walkthrough.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://walkthrough.it</a>.</p>

<p>We’ve done a lot of work on the artwork presented in this campaign. It is however very likely that some minor and maybe even so not so minor design elements will change based on further feedback we’ll get from you, our community. </p>
<p>We’ve also done a lot of work to make a game that is fun to play and that doesn’t require a training bootcamp before you can start playing. But the most exciting thing about doing this project as an open source project is that it can evolve and that people can contribute patches to the gameplay to avoid bugs you might encounter while playing.</p>
<a name=""money"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>What we will do with the money</h3>
<p>Money we receive from this campaign will only be used to build and launch this game. Our ultimate dream would be if we can reach all our stretch goals so that we get a large enough budget to also build a digital open source Card Game for the Give Us Cards campaign.</p>
<p>By backing this project you will also help Vincent, a young artist, start his career. A few months ago Vincent was looking for a job in Szeged when he contacted us. His portfolio showed his amazing talent for cartoon drawings, that is why we decided to work with him on this project. This is a unique now-or-never opportunity to combine a long standing dream with his talent to get this project started.</p>

Soon you will be able to download a printable bare bones play deck (nothing fancy just functional) to help us test play the rules of our game. We want to work together with you, our community, to make an open standard that anyone can use to create a deck, extension pack or even a single card, that will be compatible with our game. If you are interested we would very much appreciate any feedback that can help us improve the rules of the game, true open source style.
The Give Us Cards IndieGoGo campaign is run by Pronovix, a 20 people strong software consulting company based in Belgium and Hungary that’s an active contributor to the Drupal project. We are really passionate about the open source movement, and it’s community. That is why we want to further enrich the ecosystem with a collaborative marketing tool like the Give Us Cards project.
We previously did a successful IndieGoGo campaign for making better documentation tool for online software. We have fulfilled our campaign perk promises and the project looks like it is going to be a major success story, To find out more check out our campaign site at http://walkthrough.it.

Get involved

To get your hands on a test deck, or to give us feedback on the project join us at the Give Us Cards repository on GitHub.
We’ve done a lot of work on the artwork presented in this campaign. It is however very likely that some minor and maybe even so not so minor design elements will change based on further feedback we’ll get from you, our community. 
We’ve also done a lot of work to make a game that is fun to play and that doesn’t require a training bootcamp before you can start playing. But the most exciting thing about doing this project as an open source project is that it can evolve and that people can contribute patches to the gameplay to avoid bugs you might encounter while playing.

What we will do with the money
Money we receive from this campaign will only be used to build and launch this game. Our ultimate dream would be if we can reach all our stretch goals so that we get a large enough budget to also build a digital open source Card Game for the Give Us Cards campaign.
By backing this project you will also help Vincent, a young artist, start his career. A few months ago Vincent was looking for a job in Szeged when he contacted us. His portfolio showed his amazing talent for cartoon drawings, that is why we decided to work with him on this project. This is a unique now-or-never opportunity to combine a long standing dream with his talent to get this project started.

<p>10 years ago i invent a new type of cards to make House of Cards.</p>
<p>Freelance designer for long time I had the idea to make an illustrate game of construction cards for my 3 son's.</p>
<p>My first product was the Medieval Castle.  I had a good success with it and over the years I done a dozen of different thematics. </p>
<p>Every year in a trade show in Montreal I receive demand for the Blue Castle but it is sold out for a long time. </p>
<p>Of course the first batch are actually very rare. In 2003 it was a 150 cards box.</p>
<p>The 10th anniversary of the Deknik company it is the good time for me to make the Blue Castle reprint. This collection box will be my best product ever. I also will design new cards to complete the 100 extra cards.</p>
<p>The fund will cover the cost of the design of 250 cards layout, papers, pre-press material, press time for cards and box, die-cut of the cards, Shipping cost.</p>
<p>The objective is to have a special design product. An exclusive one time production box. This package will not be available again. </p>
<p>The price in store of the 2003 game was $29.99 for 150 cards. This collection box of 250 will be at the aproximative same price $30.00. The shipping cost from Montreal to you is between 15$ and 25$ (more for certain location). To be fair to every supporter I add a fix 20$ shipping. </p>
<p>I will print some extra product (10%) for donation to a children fundation in Montreal. The fondationdrjulien.org. </p>

<p>The tabletop roleplaying game, or RPG, community consists of a massive group of dedicated people who are extremely passionate about their hobby. Yet this community consists of small camps of people supporting one game system or another spread across a variety of forum boards, websites, online stores, and social media sites.</p>
<p>This can cause confusion for people entering the hobby, press releases and new information to slip through unnoticed by some, and up and coming games to go unnoticed. We intend to change all of that.</p>
<p>Imagine a website that's primary purpose was tabletop roleplaying games. A singular location containing everything you needed to know, not just about a single gaming system, but every system available. A website with an active forum board discussing the RPG hobby, an online Auction House where gamers can sell to other gamers directly, links to videos with tips and suggestions on how to run better roleplaying games, reviews on upcoming products by gamers for gamers, and an online store to purchase more roleplaying games products. Everything you need in one place, stored away and guarded over for gamers by gamers.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Dragon's Hoard!</p>
<h3>The Hoard</h3>
<p>Our current goal for the Hoard is $25,000. This will allow for the set up and licensing of our website, authinticating and copyrighting our logo, the launch of the in site Auction House and Store, and initial distribution costs of our perks to you the contributors. Speaking of perks let us take a closer look at the perks we offer.</p>
<p><strong>Counting Coppers-</strong>An affectionate name for our $1 perk will place your name forever on our website as well as having our eternal thanks for supporting this project &amp; special dragons hoard poster.</p>
<p><strong>Visage of the Dragon-</strong>At this level you will be recieving a custom t-shirt with the official Dragon's Hoard logo (A silver dragon standing over a pile of gold and tabletop roleplaying games) created by our Lead Artist Tony Dixon.</p>
<p><strong>Bronze Dragon Membership-</strong>At this level you receive a years membership to the Dragon's Hoard online store.Which entitles you to 10% of your first years purchases.</p>
<p><strong>Silver Dragon Membership-</strong> At this level you receive a life time membership to the Dragon's Hoard. Additionally this entitles you to 15% every purchase and you will never need to re-new your membership.</p>
<p><strong>Gold Dragon Membership-</strong> At this level you receive a life time membership to the Dragon's Hoard. Additionally this entitles you to 20% every purchase and you will never need to re-new your membership.</p>
<p><strong>The Chronicler-</strong> This limited perk will allow to become a permanent resident reviewer of all things gaming.Your reviews will be attached to products for sale on the Dragon's Hoard website.You will either keep the products you review or receive credit to spend at the shop.You will receive one product every two week's.</p>
<p><strong>Sean's Vault of Secrets DVD-</strong>At this level Sean Connors our Project Leader, known as theOutsiders68 on Youtube, will produce a series of 10 DM Tips videos just for you that will contain some of his best tips and smoke and mirrors strategies to help bring your gaming experiences to the next level. Additionally you will receive a signed copy of Sean's Youtube famous dungeon crawl the Tomb of Curses, being published by Brave Halfling Publishing later this year.</p>
<p><strong>A Game of Legends-</strong>At this our highest perk Sean Connors himself, or one of the Dragon's Hoard Project Team, will run a game for you and five friends on any system you like anywhere in the world. You provide the food and drinks and we provide the game.</p>
<p>Until we meet our goal of $25,000 all contributor donations will be treated as a pledge, and no money will be collected unless the project reaches its goal. In the event that we are unable to reach our goal in the alloted time the project will end and we will take it as a learning experience and come back at a later date to give it another go. We feel that the Dragon's Hoard is the perfect next step for the tabletop roleplaying games community and will return at a later date to give the project another go.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The roleplaying community sits at a crossroads, on one hand sits a fragmented kingdom where small groups don't talk to one another and remain insular and talk only amongst themselves, calling out that their game or their edition is the best and will hear no arguement. On the other road sits a singular community gathered together to share their ideas and work together to better themselves and others within the RPG hobby, where each person's voice is heard and opinions matter. This is the goal of the Dragon's Hoard.</p>
<p>Here at the Hoard we see the fragmentation, where it is system vs. system and edition vs. edition, of the RPG industry and community as a step backwards. Tabletop RPGs have always been about community and shared experiences, the gathering around the table on Friday nights with friends, dice, and paper to set out on grand adventures together. It is this sense of community that we want to bring back to the community with the Dragon's Hoard project. A one stop spot for gamers to come together to discuss ideas for games, provide links to videos where people can get advice on gaming, provide a platform for gaming entrepreneurs to show off their creations and receive feedback directly from the community that would be purchasing their product, and reunite the gaming community under a single banner to continue the betterment of this hobby. <span style=""""> </span></p>
<p>If you agree with this idea and wish to share in our vision please consider donating to the Dragon's Hoard, no matter the amount you are able to donate every little bit will help us achieve our goal.</p>

A one stop spot for gamers to come together to discuss ideas for games, provide links to videos where people can get advice on gaming, provide a platform for gaming entrepreneurs to show off their creations and receive feedback directly from the community that would be purchasing their product, and reunite the gaming community under a single banner to continue the betterment of this hobby.  
If you agree with this idea and wish to share in our vision please consider donating to the Dragon's Hoard, no matter the amount you are able to donate every little bit will help us achieve our goal.

Can't contribute right now, but still want to see the Dragon's Hoard succeed?

<h1> Using Technology to Save Lives</h1>
<p></p>
<p>How does anyone gain the experience to react correctly when lives are on the line?  Pilots need to.  Firefighters, Police, EMTs, astronauts and surgeons all need to.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/152513/files/20131024110343-flightsimtraining.jpg?1382637823"" src="""" style=""padding: 5px 10px 5px 0px; width: 125px; float: left;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>They do it with simulators.  Simulators prepare you for critical and unexpected dangers. If you’re going to have a deadly accident, do it in a simulator and learn how to avoid it in real life!  We’re graphic designers and programmers <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/152617/files/20131024114654-secondchanceblack.png?1382640414"" src="""" style=""padding: 11px 0px 0px 5px; width: 300px; float: right;""/> and avid gamers led by a former insurance investigator who has seen firsthand the horrific results of traffic accidents. We asked ourselves, why can’t we bring this same kind of training  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/152409/files/20131024101207-ruralroadrain21024.png?1382634727"" src="""" style=""padding: 7px 10px 5px 0px; width: 210px; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 5px; float: right;""/> to the young driving population? If simulations can train emergency responders to react correctly under duress, why can’t we do the same thing and help reduce the thousands of deaths and serious injuries that happen every year to our young drivers?  So we merged our graphics, <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/159499/files/20131028115422-VirtualExp2lineblack.png?1382986462"" src="""" style=""width: 162.97px; height: 41px; padding-top: 8px; padding-right: 8px; padding-bottom: 3px; float: left;""/> programming and gaming skills to create a truly unique simulator that gives inexperienced drivers that second chance. </p>
<p>We're programming a unique Artificial Intelligence engine that makes <em>Crash Course DHS</em> a totally different experience each time you use it.</p>
<p> Our <a href=""http://www.crashcoursedhs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator</a>  doesn't teach you to drive - it teaches you to survive. </p>
<p><strong>With your backing, we can all make a difference.</strong>  Saving even one life with this advanced training system makes it all worthwhile!</p>

<h3>Let's fight the leading cause of teen death</h3>
<p> Making a game, even a serious game like <em>Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator</em>, is incredibly expensive.  <strong>To get this finished, we need your help.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/154820/files/20131025155115-jckeyboard.png?1382741475"" src="""" style=""width: 200px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 10px; float: left;""/></p>
<p>We're hoping to raise $300,000 to expand our small staff .  We need to add additional game programmers and artists in addition to funding the game licenses, development software and logistics support for the additional staff so we can produce a PC version of <em>Crash Course DHS</em>. </p>

<h3>A Personal Note from our Project Director</h3>
<p><em>Crash Course DHS</em> is more than a great idea and important project to me.  It’s a mission.  It completes a circle started many years ago. </p>
<p>As an Insurance Investigator early in my career, I responded to accident sites immediately when it was my turn to be the “on-call” investigator.  Our job was to lend emotional, financial and legal support to the drivers of large commercial clients.  As you can imagine, any accident involving large commercial vehicles is devastating and usually meant fatalities in the other vehicles.  What you can’t and shouldn’t imagine is the absolute horror found at these accident sites. Even these many years later, the images are still vivid. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/157797/files/20131027144608-ProjectDirector.png?1382910368"" src="""" style=""padding: 11px 0px 0px 5px; width: 169.96px; height: 194px; float: right;""/></p>
<p>I was finished after seeing the result of a car driving in excess of 70 mph running off the road and hitting a wall head-on. The driver had misjudged distance when passing a truck at high speed.  Four people not much younger than me, were in that car.  An overwhelming accident scene, a shattered but physically uninjured truck driver, grim faced police officers and EMTs – but mostly the rage and utter futility at what could have been avoided - ended my career.  That was the true beginning of what we are calling <em>Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator.</em></p>
<p>Fast forward many years to when a disability, combined with an obsession, produced a creative solution to the very real problem of teen driving deaths and injuries. </p>
<p> My son, Jonathon suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome and also loves auto racing video games.  Very early in the process of learning to drive, he demonstrated uncanny ability to handle a variety of unexpected hazards.  When I asked how he managed to recover from an uncontrolled skid on a patch of icy road before being taught, he replied, “I do that all the time!”  What he meant, of course, was he skids a lot in racing games.  He also scored 100% on his road test the first time out.</p>
<p>While arranging insurance for Jonathon, I related this story to the agent.  The agent remarked half kiddingly, “Every kid should be forced to play those games!”  When I told that to Jonathon, I saw a light bulb go off above his head – he suffers from ASD but he’s not inscrutable!  His idea: “Dad, you’re a programmer, we should do a game where you can learn to handle dangerous stuff like that!”  The kernel of <em>Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator</em> was born.</p>
<p>Things had truly come full circle.  It took decades and the unique thought processes of an ASD sufferer but I could finally address that futility I felt so many years ago.</p>

Crash Course DHS


 Using Technology to Save Lives

How does anyone gain the experience to react correctly when lives are on the line?  Pilots need to.  Firefighters, Police, EMTs, astronauts and surgeons all need to.


They do it with simulators.  Simulators prepare you for critical and unexpected dangers. If you’re going to have a deadly accident, do it in a simulator and learn how to avoid it in real life!  We’re graphic designers and programmers  and avid gamers led by a former insurance investigator who has seen firsthand the horrific results of traffic accidents. We asked ourselves, why can’t we bring this same kind of training   to the young driving population? If simulations can train emergency responders to react correctly under duress, why can’t we do the same thing and help reduce the thousands of deaths and serious injuries that happen every year to our young drivers?  So we merged our graphics,  programming and gaming skills to create a truly unique simulator that gives inexperienced drivers that second chance. 
We're programming a unique Artificial Intelligence engine that makes Crash Course DHS a totally different experience each time you use it.
 Our Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator  doesn't teach you to drive - it teaches you to survive. 
With your backing, we can all make a difference.  Saving even one life with this advanced training system makes it all worthwhile!

Let's fight the leading cause of teen death
 Making a game, even a serious game like Crash Course Driving Hazard Simulator, is incredibly expensive.  To get this finished, we need your help.

We're hoping to raise $300,000 to expand our small staff .  We need to add additional game programmers and artists in addition to funding the game licenses, development software and logistics support for the additional staff so we can produce a PC version of Crash Course DHS. 
Any additional contributions will help fund versions for additional platforms - even additional languages!    Teen driving tragedies are universal so we have international editions on the drawing board for both right and left-hand drive countries.  Once the Crash Course DHS core programming is done, we can begin the artwork and translations for individual country editions .  We also have a networked  version planned so young drivers can drive together in the same virtual world. 
Imagine the learning opportunities where a driver can assume different roles - road rager, drunken driver - and endanger other drivers! 
We've come up with some exciting perks that let you actively participate (besides contributing) and also let the world know you care.   When you contribute $40 or more, you receive an electronic copy of the final Crash Course DHS program. For a $65 contribution, you receive the electronic version plus a packaged DVD. Why not multiply your contribution by giving the DVD as a gift and keeping and using the other?  Can you imagine how you'll feel if they avoid even a minor fender bender as a result of your generosity?
Our exclusive backer T shirts proudly proclaim your help and support on both the back and front.  Our shirts are high quality, yellow with black lettering and images.  
The Deluxe and Collector's editions, with the steering wheel/ pedals and Track-IR (Deluxe edition) rig make phenomenal gifts!  
Adding a steering wheel to an already immersive virtual world takes the immersiveness up a really big notch.
With the Collectors Edition, you'll receive an easy to set up steering wheel, brake and gas pedals.  Really take control with this rig.  Add to this our thanks and acknowledgement as a ""Benefactor"" on our Credits web page. The Collector's Edition also includes everything from the prior perks levels too.

</div></div>","Have you ever felt proud for some of your hardest achievements in video-games?You spend hours developing tactics and training your precision, failed and tried again hundreds of times, became lightning-fast and with a bit of luck you make it – you unlock the achievement! Enter a small pixelated picture, all you get for your hard work and effort. I’ve always wanted the achievement to be tangible, something you can put on the shelf to be proud of yourself. You deserve real awards for your in-game achievements!
 
You can get a medal for each Platinum Trophy on PlayStation or 1000G on Xbox. The website is fully integrated with these systems and tracks your progress in real time to let you get the award you really deserve.
 
It’s silver-colored medal 4 cm wide 40x3 mm. The upper part contains the game title, the lower part contains your PS or Xbox nickname. The center of the medal is decorated with an image, an in-game object, symbol or anything else that reflects the spirit of the game. The rest of the surface is black allowing for greater contrast of the silvery part. The medal has a its own number stored in our database, which makes it unique and personalized.

<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Microsoft
decided not to continue developing the XNA Framwork any further,</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Many
alternatives do not come bundled with a handy content pipeline tool,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">XNA's
CP </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">only
runs on Windows machines since it uses the MSBuild API,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">XNA's
CP</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> GUI

Studio IDE,</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Can
you
use
the XNA's CP from within VS 2012 or VS 2013? Nope ...,</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why
non-programmers should use any programming IDE as a CP in the first
place?</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">XNA's
CP
only produces binaries targetting Microsoft's platforms</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(ii) Think of the APE as a replacement of XNA's

<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...

does
not strictly work the same way as XNA's CP did, ...</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...

<p>The way the APE works can be described in three
words: <b>Simple. Elegant. Handy.</b></p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(i) Basically, you
...:</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
create
a new APE's solution and add projects per platform ...</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
add
custom containers per project (and or use the ones provided by default)
...</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
add
folders and raw files (being the latter the content) to each container
...</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
customize the input/output options per file (which could vary per
platform) ...</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
indicate how the nodes in the solution tree must be built and copied,
then ...</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
press
the 'Build' button for the whole solution or one selected project
... </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(ii) ...
and then, the APE will ...</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
convert
each raw file into a content file for your specific game ...</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
copy
the
files to the output folders you specify, if applicable ... </span></li>
<li>

<p>Again: <b>Simple! Elegant! Handy!</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">(iii) Take a peek at
the APE's key logic
elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">AssetData:</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> it defines the structure of a
game asset. Some of you may refer to it as a DOM.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Importers:</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in charge of
directing the whole process of converting the input (raw files) into
output (the asset files for your game).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Processors:</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in charge of
processing the input files in order to get a concrete asset data. A
great power at your finger tips ... and ""with great power ..."".</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Formatters:</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in charge of giving a
structure to the output file. Add your own headers. Decide the type of
serialization format you want to apply.  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Writers:</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in charge of packing
and writing the output file as you define. Want to add metadata? How
about some compression tasks of asset data? And protection? Yes! Now
you can.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Packagers:</b> in
charge of packaging the output structure (that is, asset files and
parent folders) of each project into one or several compressed files.
You define what, how and where.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>The APE gives you full control over the build
process</b> of
content file ... it is in fact your build process!<br/></p>
<p>So, create your key logic elements, add them to the
editor
as
plug-in dynamic libraries, and start feeling the magic!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">(iv) How about testing?</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Yes! </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The
APE
comes with an assembly designed for testing purposes.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Add
break
points, </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Debug
offending code, </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Step
through the whole source code until the import/write units are ready to
go!</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Testing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/229317/files/20131128061226-lupa01.png?1385647946"" src="""" style=""width: 460px; height: 459px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A time-saving feature ... </p>

</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">(<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">v)
Anything
else?</span></p>
<p>Yes! In addition to all these elements, the APE defines
one
more key element: <b>Previewers ...</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
they
help you define how to handle the preview of file types,</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">...
think
of them as a general-purpose WIC-kindof element.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The APE
comes
with a few previewers for common business-friendly license formats
(only for Windows at the
current stage), but ...:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>... you can create your own as plug-in dynamic
libraries
for the editor,</li>
<li>... and even replace the default previewers that come
with
it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, the APE has a command-line tool
called ""<b>APEBuild</b>"":</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269348/files/20131219060123-ss_01.png?1387461683"" src="""" style=""width: 400px; height: 238px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This tool can be used, for instance, to automate batch
builds on a server-side environment. Yes, commit source and
solution/project files, execute the tool, and return when the build is
done. Great!</p>

<p>The first set of extended goals aims to the creation of
standard 2D games, and by ""standard"" I mean, without the use of shaders.</p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(i) 2D
Textures</b></p>
<p>Based on the surface formats supported by the last
version
of
the XNA Framework, the following output will be available:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Colour
(standard 32-bit RGBA texture),</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Compressed
(yes! DXT 1 and 5 compression),</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Unchanged
(for supported surface formats).</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus some other features like mip-map generation
 ...
stay tuned for videos explaining them.</p>
<p><b>(B) Fonts</b></p>
<p>The APE's equivalents for XNA's font processors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Font
textures (supporting the same format used by the XNA Framework),
and </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Font

<p>The second set of extended goals aims to build
SoundEffect,
Song and Video content files.</p>
<p><b>(A) Sound Effects</b><br/></p>
<p>The output file will be an uncompressed PCM sound
effect,
where you will be able to select its quality as per Monogame's
specs: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""Best""
(source sample rate), </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""Medium""
(3/4 of the source sample rate),</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> ""Low""
(1/2 of the source sample rate).</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(B) Songs</b><br/></p>
<p><b>XNA's Content Pipeline does not bundle audio
bits
with the "".xnb"" binary file</b>. In fact, it generates a tiny
file that embeds the relative path to the audio file to load and play
(and its duration).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">(i) So ... ?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Encoding
for the WAV audio fomat will be provided,</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Encoding

</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Encoding

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(ii) Therefore ...? </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You

</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Use
the
pass-through processor to create the corresponding binary file for it.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>(C) Videos</b></p>
<p><b>Just like with the Song content, XNA creates a
binary
file with the relative path to the WMV file and some additional data</b>,
like, among others, duration and size (width and height).</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">(i) So ...
?</span><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The

it.</span><br/>

this is an ""all-or-nothing""
campaign!
(please read IndieGoGo's ""Fixed-Funding"" topic for details)



The APE
stands
for ""The
Asset Pipeline Editor"" created
by Pedro
Güida -a former MSFT XNA/DX MVP.
(i)
Some of its key features:


It is
          a highly-customizable tool,


It eases the
task of
managing game content throughout the whole development
process,


It
          helps
you build asset files and processes for the platforms you
desire, tailoring them for each platform,


It is
a
          perfect choice not only for solo
devs but also for teams, and


Its
GUI is
independent from any programming IDE!!!




(ii) Build
your
own import process, the one you dream of, with C# ...
Are you programming your games with C++, Objective-C,
C#,
Java, Phyton ... <pick your language here> ... and you
need a content pipeline? Not using authorware like Unity3D, UDK,
CryEngine or others? Have your own game engine? Then the APE will help
you (and your team)
manage your game assets with ease!
Use the well-known developer-friendly C# language to
implement the software elements that will drive the behavior of the APE
for your game-dev process.



Good
question. 
(i) The answers ...

Microsoft
decided not to continue developing the XNA Framwork any further,

Many
alternatives do not come bundled with a handy content pipeline tool,


XNA's
CP only
runs on Windows machines since it uses the MSBuild API,


XNA's
CP GUI
has not been updated to work with the latest versions of the Visual
Studio IDE,

Can
you
use
the XNA's CP from within VS 2012 or VS 2013? Nope ...,
Why
non-programmers should use any programming IDE as a CP in the first
place?

XNA's
CP
only produces binaries targetting Microsoft's platforms.


(ii) Think of the APE as a replacement of XNA's
content pipeline ""in spirit"" since ...


...
it
does
not strictly work the same way as XNA's CP did, ...


...
it
does
not come bundled with content importers for your game assets, ...

...
but
it
could have some importers if the extended goals are reached (wink!).


The way the APE works can be described in three
words: Simple. Elegant. Handy.
(i) Basically, you
...:


...
create
a new APE's solution and add projects per platform ...

...
add
custom containers per project (and or use the ones provided by default)
...
...
add
folders and raw files (being the latter the content) to each container
...
...
customize the input/output options per file (which could vary per
platform) ...
...
indicate how the nodes in the solution tree must be built and copied,
then ...
...
press
the 'Build' button for the whole solution or one selected project
... 

(ii) ...
and then, the APE will ...


...
convert
each raw file into a content file for your specific game ...
...
copy
the
files to the output folders you specify, if applicable ... 

...
and presto!
That is it!



Again: Simple! Elegant! Handy!
(iii) Take a peek at
the APE's key logic
elements:


AssetData: it defines the structure of a
game asset. Some of you may refer to it as a DOM.


Importers: in charge of
directing the whole process of converting the input (raw files) into
output (the asset files for your game).


Processors: in charge of
processing the input files in order to get a concrete asset data. A
great power at your finger tips ... and ""with great power ..."".


Formatters: in charge of giving a
structure to the output file. Add your own headers. Decide the type of
serialization format you want to apply.  


Writers: in charge of packing
and writing the output file as you define. Want to add metadata? How
about some compression tasks of asset data? And protection? Yes! Now
you can.

Packagers: in
charge of packaging the output structure (that is, asset files and
parent folders) of each project into one or several compressed files.
You define what, how and where.

The APE gives you full control over the build
process of
content file ... it is in fact your build process!
So, create your key logic elements, add them to the
editor
as
plug-in dynamic libraries, and start feeling the magic!
(iv) How about testing?
Yes! The
APE
comes with an assembly designed for testing purposes. 


Add
break
points, 

Debug
offending code, 

Step
through the whole source code until the import/write units are ready to
go!






A time-saving feature ... 

...
no
more
witchcraft to debug importers ...

...
period.


(v)
Anything
else?
Yes! In addition to all these elements, the APE defines
one
more key element: Previewers ...


...
they
help you define how to handle the preview of file types,

...
think
of them as a general-purpose WIC-kindof element.








The APE
comes
with a few previewers for common business-friendly license formats
(only for Windows at the
current stage), but ...:

... you can create your own as plug-in dynamic
libraries
for the editor,
... and even replace the default previewers that come
with
it!

Last but not least, the APE has a command-line tool
called ""APEBuild"":



This tool can be used, for instance, to automate batch
builds on a server-side environment. Yes, commit source and
solution/project files, execute the tool, and return when the build is
done. Great!

The APE is on alpha stage for the Windows OS
platform.
(i) So ...


...
it is
not yet ready for a public release,


...
it is
functional for in-house projects, 


... there are some features left to
add ...

...
plus
some more testing to do.

(ii)
Right
now, out of the box for non-inhouse purposes ... 
... the
tool
has no other import unit than the pass-through one, and...
the
tool can
be therefore used as content organizer, only.
(iii) ... that is of course ...
...
unless individual extended goals are reached in this campaign.
Remember that you can create your own import units.
(iv) In
case
you may be wondering it, 
...
if this campaign fails the APE there is no intention of public
the APE...
so,
in
that case, it will remain private for in-house productions,
only.





The main
goal of this campaign is
to push the
APE
to
its first release version,
as a commercial solution for the Window OS platforms
supported by the .NET Framework v4.5 (check
system requierements here). 
(i) Some of
the remaining tasks to
achieve
this goal:


Replace
some
third-party APIs with commercial solutions,


Clean up some source code and comment operations,


Documentation (sigh! Always a bummer ...),


Coding
samples (for
you to reference).


Build a ""pro"" website for the product.

Add a
few more (needed) features.

More testing
(public testing).


Others (licenses, etc.).


(ii) Regarding each
license of the APE's first release
version
...


...
the
price of each
license will be $100 USD per seat per platform,


...
you
can
get at least one license depending on your contribution to this
campaing,


...
          the
minimum contribution to get one license is $30 USD. A bargain!


So take
a
moment to read carefully the available perks for your kind
contributions (to get licenses and even early access to the product).
(iii) A few notes
regarding this goal and extended goals:

All
the goals in this campaign conform the phase 1
in the APE's roadmap,

All
import
units developed for each extended goal that gets reached will be
released as open source,

For extended goals #1 to #3, the XNB file format documentation will be followed.

Unless
goal #4 is reached on the campaign, import/write units created on extended goals from
#1 upto #3 will
not have LZX compression,


Solutions -currently
found- for
each extended goal may change by the time development starts, and

Content
types not mentioned in any of the extended goals will not be provided
in
this campaign.

Puzzled? Please read these posts for an in-depth
explanation
...



The first set of extended goals aims to the creation of
standard 2D games, and by ""standard"" I mean, without the use of shaders.
(i) 2D
Textures
Based on the surface formats supported by the last
version
of
the XNA Framework, the following output will be available:


Colour
(standard 32-bit RGBA texture),


Compressed
(yes! DXT 1 and 5 compression),


Unchanged
(for supported surface formats).


Plus some other features like mip-map generation
 ...
stay tuned for videos explaining them.
(B) Fonts
The APE's equivalents for XNA's font processors:


Font
textures (supporting the same format used by the XNA Framework),
and 

Font
descriptors (yes! Font textures will be created according to the
description).



The second set of extended goals aims to build
SoundEffect,
Song and Video content files.
(A) Sound Effects
The output file will be an uncompressed PCM sound
effect,
where you will be able to select its quality as per Monogame's
specs: 


""Best""
(source sample rate), 


""Medium""
(3/4 of the source sample rate),


 ""Low""
(1/2 of the source sample rate).


(B) Songs
XNA's Content Pipeline does not bundle audio
bits
with the "".xnb"" binary file. In fact, it generates a tiny
file that embeds the relative path to the audio file to load and play
(and its duration).
(i) So ... ?


Encoding
for the WAV audio fomat will be provided,


Encoding
for the Ogg/Vorbis audio format may or may not be provided,


MP3 encoding/decoding will NOT
be provided due to its restrictive licensing model,


Encoding
for WMA and XMA/XMA2 audio formats will NOT be provided.


(ii) Therefore ...? 


You
can
always get the format that you need in an external audio editor


Use
the
pass-through processor to create the corresponding binary file for it.


(C) Videos
Just like with the Song content, XNA creates a
binary
file with the relative path to the WMV file and some additional data,
like, among others, duration and size (width and height).
(i) So ...
?


The
processor will just copy the source video without any modification to
it.


You
wil
be
able to provide other formats than WMV ones, in case you need it.


(ii) Therefore ...? 

You can always get the format that you need in an
external
audio editor
Use
the
pass-through processor to create the corresponding binary file for it.



The third set of extended goals aims to build some of
the
content types used for 3D games, like volume textures, cube texture, 3D
models and custom effects.
(A) 3D/Cube Textures
As a corolary of the extended goal #1, there are a
couple of
texture types supported by the XNA Framework (and Monogame): 3D
textures and Cube textures ...


...
import
volume and cube textures directly (yes! DDS ones), and ...

...
create
these type of textures directly from the APE it-self.

And yes! With mip-mapping.
(B) 3D Models
You
know the drill ...


Bones, 


Transforms, 


Model
Meshes,


Model
mesh
parts, 


Bounding
spheres, 


Vertex
declarations, 


Vertex
and
index buffers,

... and so on so forth.
        

The
whole
standard
bunch. There is a lot to do and test here!
(C) Custom Shaders
The icing on the cake!
You
provide
the proper compiled shader object for the target platform (not source
files), and the
APE
will take that object (say, a "".cso"" file) and generate the
corresponding binary file ("".xnb"").
Yes! You will be able to set different binary shaders
(that is to say, files with compiled byte-code) under the same asset name on a
platform basis targeting either DX or
OpenGL and its versions.



Even
though by using the APE you could change the code of import/write units
your-selves to compress asset data with any of the compression techniques
supported by the .NET Framework 4.5, and Monogame's source code could
get modified to support such techniques (ditto for other solutions -like WaveEngine and such- or your own game engine), the goal here is to develop a
LZX compressor with C#
(following
      Microsoft's documentation) and integrate it with the import/write units developed for goals #1 to #3.
A difficult task, with lots of trying
and error, but with patience, hard work and your support it could get
done. Let's go for it!




Now, about monetary contributions ...
For those of you willing to contribute with some cash to
this
campaign, basically ...:


...
for
$10
USD you will have my gratitude, only,


...
for
$30 USD, you will get one license of the APE v1.x_final
(when
released),


...
          after
that entry point, depending on your contribution you could
get more
licenses, early access to the bits and even a special mention on the credits,


... licenses are per seat per platform so each license is assigned to one seat for a specific platform,

... all licenses are valid for the first release version of the APE unless indicated in the corresponding perk (they could last more), and
... contributors (excluding ""Casual Backers"") will always get special upgrade prices.

Please
take a few minutes to check
the perks. 
Before making any contribution to this (or any)
campaign, it is important that you carefully (read and) assess all its
risks as well as the moral/technical solvency of the campaign's owner.
Basically, regarding the risks,
please be aware that ...


...
some of the technologies to be used to achieve -mainly- the extended
goals may change its licensing to
non-business-friendly ones, forcing the dev to look for alternatives,

... extended goals, if reached, could remain
uncompleted
for a time period that exceeds expectations,
... some of the goals could get never
achieved due to reasons (technical, legal or else) beyond
dev's power, 
... dev costs for the project as a whole or in part
may have been miscalculated, generating a risk of roadmap truncation.

Regarding
      the dev, as many
of you may already know, inter
alia:

Pedro was an MVP for the techs of XNA and DirectX, 
He reviewed books (and even one video course)
about XNA, 
He was a mod in the ""Create"" forums (even though I
was
not one of the most active mods),
He used to write about
the XNA Framework and what not wherever he could (like in his blog,
for instance),
He was finalist in a couple of contests (local and
international) on 2008 (where he used the XNA Framework for his
entries), and last but not least
He still knows the XNA Framework by heart (he is an
expert), being this
point, one of the most relevant ones for this campaign.

Rest assured, even though that -like in any
investment/contribution- there are usually no guarantees, that Pedro
will do his best to mitigate all of the above-mentioned risks.
So let us hope you decide
to contribute to this campaign.

In case you cannot afford a monetary contribution, you
can
help by:

Using IndieGoGo's share tools,

Generating buzz about this
campaign
among your contacts, and

Providing me with commercial-friendly
licenses
in case you believe your products could boost the development of the
APE and or the APE it-self!

Taking to TPTB that you may know at
companies that develop products that I might use to achieve
this campaign's goals so as to convince them to contribute as indicated
in the previous bullet.


The
Asset
Pipeline Editor (or ""the APE"") is an outstanding tool to manage content
files and create your own build process. 
It is
      independent
of
any programming IDE
and if this campaign succeeds, and after completing development for all
the goals eventually reached in this campaign, phase 2 could then begin in order to
port it to MacOsX and Linux platforms (but not as part of this campaign). Yes, phase 1 here targets
Windows OS platform and phase 2 porting it with the help of Xamarin.Mac
for MacOsX and GTK# for Linux OS. Multiplatform support is coming your
way ...
You
will
witness soon that the
APE is indeed worth every cent/penny you may
contribute here.
In short, a must have!
Thanks guys
for reading and in advance for
your
support/contributions!!!

<h2>Medieval Madness</h2>
<p>Medieval Madness is a real-time strategy board game for two players where strategy and speed are equally important. The game is set in Medieval Times and it tells the story of two kings who fight out their age-old conflict in a final battle.</p>
<p>The game is in real-time, so there is no taking turns. All the actions and units of the game are displayed on coins. By drawing coins from a pouch the player can make his units take different actions. Units can attack, move, defend and barricade. A player is only allowed to hold one coin at a time, so it must either be used or discarded directly before drawing another. The goal of the game is to defeat all enemy units.</p>
<p>We think Medieval Madness will appeal to the board game fanatic. The game is really easy to learn but is hard to master. Even though the rules are simple, the possibilities are endless. After lots of testing we still encounter different situations and come up with new strategies. The game is therefore very competitive and replayable. The game is short, but intense, because an average game takes 10 minutes. A great game when you have a few minutes to spare.</p>

<h2>Our goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is to get a total of $13.000. Although this might seem like a lot, it is the minimum amount of money that we need to print and produce the game and ship it to you. To print the game at a professional company we need to order a minimum of 1000 units. Combined with shipping costs to Europe and the rest of the world we need the 13.000 to at least break even. We are not looking for a huge profit, our first and main goal is to get our game on the market, for others to enjoy.</p>
<p>If we exceed the $13.000 mark we can use that profit to further promote and sell our game. We have also started developing a tablet version of the game (IOS/Android), and some extra resources can also help this project. We really believe Medieval Madness is a great game and that it can be a success. The game is fully designed and tested, all we need to do is print and publish the game, something that we cannot do without your donations!</p>

<h3>Print and play</h3>
<p>The print and play version of the game features the playfield (A3), the coins (A4, can be best printed on a label), and the instruction manual. You could use something like cardboard to make your own coins.</p>
<h3>Shipping costs</h3>
<p>The price for the game is $25. The shipping costs are $10 for Europe and $20 for worldwide. The shipping costs are included in the perks. If you want multiple copies please use the multiple copies perk for your region, you will only have to pay the shipping costs once. For example: you would like to buy 3 copies and you live in Europe. You will have to pay: 3 X $25 + $10 = <strong>$85.</strong></p>
<h3>Be a king / queen</h3>
<p>If you claim one of the two 'Be a king / queen' perks, you can choose the name of one of the kings / queens. It does not necessarily have to be your name, you can also choose one. We do have some restrictions on what the name can be. It has to at least sound like a name or a title (something like ‘the conqueror'). It cannot be a nickname like xDoomslayer4000 since it does not sound like an actual name. Of course, no strong language and other dirty words allowed.</p>
<p>The name is used in the premise of the game, you can read it in the instruction manual. The names that are used now are 'Christofer' and 'Emielius'. The premise will also be featured on the back of the box.</p></div>","Medieval Madness

We will be creating a heroic tale of a lonely knight who's past has damned him to better his world and rid the world of the corrupt evil. This game will have varying mechanics, to aid your mission and different ways to play it it will be a 2D platformer with a hack and slash game aspects and interesting story.

</ul><p><strong>Promotional Guardians!</strong><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are a number of special Guardians available from the Platinum Supporter perk.  In each of the following cases, the Guardians will be <i>exclusive</i> to this promotion and unavailable to other players in any way until 2016.  This means that only participants of the Indigogo campaign will have access to these Guardians for a full year after the public launch date!  After this date, these Guardians may be available as high end tournament prizes or other promotions, but they will never again be offered with maximum stats as they are here</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p></p><strong><strong>What platform(s) will the game run on?</strong></strong><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the early Alpha stage, the game will be run only via the <a href=""https://unity3d.com/webplayer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unity Web Player</a>, which is available to both Windows and Mac players.  Any computer compatible with this player can run the Alpha test through a browser window.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The game will initially launch for Windows and Mac downloadable clients as well.  Long term plans include Ouya and Linux platforms as well.</span></p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">How will the money be used?</b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The money will primarily be used to pay developer salaries so that they can work full-time on this rather than having to have a secondary source of income.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Funds beyond that will be used to contract with artists and license music, as well as help pay for server upgrades.</span></p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">What happens if you don't reach your goal?</b><br/></p><p>Our developers will be living off of instant noodles for several months :(</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Seriously though, this campaign is set to flexible funding mode.  We can produce this game on a shoestring budget if we absolutely have to.  This is because we can do most of the coding and art in house.  It will, however, take a lot longer to finish the project for launch, and the end result will not be as polished as it could be.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Meeting the goal allows us to outsource a lot of the work and hire better artistic talent and hire more developers to the team.   This will enable us to release the project much faster and it will be a better game overall!</span></p><p><strong>Why Alpha test?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most gamers are familiar with MMOs having a Beta phase where they seek out members of the gaming community to participate in a “closed” or “open” Beta.  A game in Beta phase is mostly finished – just a little bit of polish and a few bugs ironing out.  Most of the time, player feedback during this phase is ignored (unless it is a critical bug report)</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">A game in Alpha testing, however, is still exploring it’s mechanics and has room to grow.  Alpha tests are usually much smaller, which allows people in the test a direct line to the developer’s ear.  Because of these reasons, your feedback may actually shape how the game develops before it becomes closer to being finalized.  In addition, you get to watch a game as it progresses from infacy to a full-fledged game – which is a huge insight into how a game is made if you have an interest in working in the video game industry in the future.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">That said, however, there are a lot more glitches and much of the art will be place-holders until it comes closer to a finished stage.</span></p><p><strong>When do I receive my Perks?</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Basic Supporter and Copper Supporter packages will receive a coupon code via email when the game reaches Beta stage OR becomes open to the public during late Alpha (whichever happens first based on production needs).   The Basic and Copper Supporter perks do not include an Alpha testing key.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">For </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Silver Supporter and above – your Alpha test key will be emailed to you as soon as Alpha testing begins.  Our goal is to have the Alpha test ready to accept players within 40 days of campaign ending.  </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The first phase of the Alpha test will be open from Friday morning through Sunday night.  Once the client reaches a more stable version and does not require many updates, it will be open full-time.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">All other perks will be handed out as the game reaches a stage where they are supported, and will be automatically credited to an account created with the Alpha test key.  (Premium currency, for example, isn’t used until the game gets closer to Beta and the Premium Store opens.)</span></p><p><strong>What makes a Guardian ‘Common’, ‘Uncommon’, or ‘Rare’?</strong></p><p>Guardians of Noterra uses a region-based system for Guardian distribution.  Guardians found in the country of Cailatia may be very different from those found in Hondaco.  In order to somewhat preserve the different metagames for each region, a rarity system is devised, indicating how hard they are to find and import into the region.Due to the plague spread by invading monsters, each region has differing import restrictions in order to avoid cross contamination.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Common:</b>  Common Guardians are frequent in the region.  They can easily be found in the wild and it is trivial to import Guardians from the same family that appear in other regions.</p><p><b>Uncommon:</b>  Uncommon Guardians appear infrequently in the region.  While they can be found in the wild, it is much less likely.  Importing Uncommon Guardians is not very difficult.</p><p><b>Rare:</b>  The 'Rare' category covers Guardians that are not native to the region. They do not appear in the wild anywhere in the region and the import restrictions on Rare Guardians is quite steep.  Rare Guardians are not necessarily more powerful - it just means they cannot be found in that region normally.  A Guardian that is Rare to the Hondaco Region may be Common in the Cailatia region, and vice-versa.</p><p><br/></p><p>The rarities play a part in Region-based tournament modes.  Participants in high level tournaments bring up to 5 Guardians to a battle, but at most 1 of these may be Rare.  This allows participants to master the metagame within a specific region with only a few 'wild cards'.  Worldwide events allow Guardians from all over the world and do not have this restriction.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Microtransactions?  You mean this game will be Pay-to-Win?</strong></p><p>We despise games that are designed to be Pay-to-Win, and will be doing everything we can to avoid that outcome.  We plan to offer cosmetic and feature perks on the store that do not significantly affect gameplay.  We may offer Uncommon and Rare Guardians as well with the understanding that these Guardians are not necessarily more powerful than Common Guardians, just harder to get (and thus it is a time-saving feature).</p><p>Anything in the Cash Store that has a gameplay benefit will be obtainable in-game in some way - such as through Tournament prizes or promotional events.  Additionally, we plan to make the Cash Store currency tradeable so that players can exchange in-game currency for Cash Store currency.  Thus, all the features are available in some way, free to play.</p><br/><h3><strong>A Message from the Lead Developer;</strong></h3>

It is designed primarily for Windows systems with a very high chance for future ports on Linux, Mac, PS4 and XBOX One. Turbo 80 puts you in control of a specially designed flying vehicle which has different types of weapons mounted on it. There are four general classes of vehicles in the game, each encouraging a different play style:
The Traveller – Really fast, has weak firepower, can be very easy to destroy
The Destroyer – Moderately fast, has strong ranged firepower, can be moderately easy to destroy
The Shielder – Very slow, strong in close combat, very hard to destroy
The Ressurecter – Moderately fast, can repair other vehicles in multiple ways, can be moderately hard to destroy
The combat system features two teams consisting of six players each with various vehicle types fighting for multiple points of interest on the map. The prototype of Turbo 80 contains only one implemented single player game mode in which the goal of the players is to capture multiple volumes of space scattered around the map by flying within them for 10 seconds in total. The first team to capture all the control points wins the round. The levels in Turbo 80 can be generated completely procedurally, although we are currently using a hybrid method to make them more functional. We have a specially designed algorithm for generating cities that have various building types which can adapt to a procedurally generated terrain. Within the city we are able to produce flying vehicle traffic that is programmed to follow special rules of the so-called “true-3D space”. The physics in Turbo 80 are custom-made fully kinematic which allow for a more arcade-style type of gameplay predominant in 80s games.The prototype of Turbo 80 has an AI system written from scratch, and is able to navigate in non-planar 3D space (unrestricted up-down forward-backward left-right movement) which makes it distinctive from similar games in the genre.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>We need $357,000 for further development of B'Bop and Friends 3D World. During this project we will develop Game and App Tech skills by providing employment opportunities, internships and mentoring to minorities interested in Game and App Development.  The details are listed below.<ul>
<li><p>    We will expand the Basketball Game and create a Michigan High School<br/>    Championship Basketball Game for the two final teams.  New live action<br/>    NCAA style of play will be created and applied to the basketball players such<br/>    as powerful dunking, blocking, guarding, all the phenomenal plays you see in<br/>    the NCAA.  Players will be able to play the game and compete<br/>    from anywhere in the world on the Internet.  Of course we can't upgrade to<br/>    this level of play without creating a 3D College level Basketball Arena with<br/>    people in the stands, coaches, referees and cheerleaders for the Michigan High<br/>    School Championship Finals.  Customers will have the choice to purchase the<br/>    newly enhanced Basketball Game individually or a smaller version of the<br/>    enhanced Basketball game bundled in the B'Bop and Friends 3D B'Bop and<br/>    Friends 3D World.  </p></li>
<li>    To add more interactivity in the 3D Bedrooms for each character, we have<br/>    hired a Fashion Designer from New York, to design new original clothing for<br/>    each character.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There's a big hole in the Gaming Industry that needs to be filled.  Missing are African-Americans.  With a successful Game Development business, B'Bop and Friends will be able to develop and provide Tech employment opportunities to minorities, start an internship and mentoring program for minorities who dream of becoming Game and App Developers and Creators.  B'Bop and Friends is positioned to interrupt the cycle of non-inclusion in this multi billion dollar industry.<br/> <br/>Children need to see that it's possible and obtainable for African-American's to use their imagination and Technology to develop solutions that solve problems and change the world.  Children need to see African-American's in the profession's they are being encouraged to pursue.  We also need to be in a position to assist minorities with developing their Tech skills.</p>
<p>I started a gaming business because of the interest African-American children have in games.  I know that we can reach them here and that's my goal and my mission to help our children become developers and creators, not just users and buyers of Tech. They need to have an interest, but it's up to us to give them the exposure and opportunities to develop those interest. </p>
<p> A young Concept Artist who attends College of Creative Studies in Detroit has joined our team and will be creating the Concept Art for the new characters we will be using in the next release of the game,  After seeing the work the Concept Artist is doing, 16 and 15 year old Gamer's became very interested in Game Development and asked if they can work with us to create games.  After watching them play the B'Bop and Friends Basketball Game which they figured out on their own and the feedback they provided, I knew right away I needed them to be on the Game Design team.  I decided to bring them on as B'Bop and Friends Interns to help design and test the new enhancements for this project.  They are very smart and learn very quickly.  They are very happy and very excited to have this once in a life time opportunity to intern at a Game Development Company and be on a Game Design team at 16 and 15 years old.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially that doesn't mean you can't help.   Please help us get the word out and share the information about the Campaign that can be a game changer for many minority children and youth.  We need your support so whatever you can do will be greatly appreciated.  </p>

    The Dance Studio will also get an upgrade.  We want to create a Hip Hop    Dance Crew with Noe and 3 new characters.  Character Noe and her crew will    be able to change Dancing outfit's depending on their Dance schedule which    could be rehearsals, recitals or dance classes.         



The Impact
There's a big hole in the Gaming Industry that needs to be filled.  Missing are African-Americans.  With a successful Game Development business, B'Bop and Friends will be able to develop and provide Tech employment opportunities to minorities, start an internship and mentoring program for minorities who dream of becoming Game and App Developers and Creators.  B'Bop and Friends is positioned to interrupt the cycle of non-inclusion in this multi billion dollar industry. Children need to see that it's possible and obtainable for African-American's to use their imagination and Technology to develop solutions that solve problems and change the world.  Children need to see African-American's in the profession's they are being encouraged to pursue.  We also need to be in a position to assist minorities with developing their Tech skills.
I started a gaming business because of the interest African-American children have in games.  I know that we can reach them here and that's my goal and my mission to help our children become developers and creators, not just users and buyers of Tech. They need to have an interest, but it's up to us to give them the exposure and opportunities to develop those interest. 
 A young Concept Artist who attends College of Creative Studies in Detroit has joined our team and will be creating the Concept Art for the new characters we will be using in the next release of the game,  After seeing the work the Concept Artist is doing, 16 and 15 year old Gamer's became very interested in Game Development and asked if they can work with us to create games.  After watching them play the B'Bop and Friends Basketball Game which they figured out on their own and the feedback they provided, I knew right away I needed them to be on the Game Design team.  I decided to bring them on as B'Bop and Friends Interns to help design and test the new enhancements for this project.  They are very smart and learn very quickly.  They are very happy and very excited to have this once in a life time opportunity to intern at a Game Development Company and be on a Game Design team at 16 and 15 years old.

These are a limited run, and will be something worth having in any collection, so be sure to get one before they run out!We believe that one of the most important things for a game like this to be truly awesome is to have quality content all along, and avoid filler segments at all cost. With that in mind, the graphical style chosen along with the custom engine that drives it, enables us to create quickly and nearly effortlessly content with a definitely unique look. (You can get some more info about the engine in this devlog post: http://www.fa-el.com/devlog/20140112204751.html )As with any software project, there are unpredictable factors that can be anticipated but not exactly predicted. That being said, we are confident that with our small tight team, there won't be much interference for delivering the product we want to make on time.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ASPECTS OF THE GAME</strong></p>

<p>• Embark on unique quests from mystical oracles who promise mountains of rich rewards.</p>
<p>• Craft armor, cut jewels, and concoct potions as you master an array of professions.</p>

<p>• Gather rare Frostiron atop the icy, jagged peak of Mount Aslund, or venture across the vast sands of Zathas to acquire exquisite gems.</p>
<p>• Hone your fighting skills by battling a wide variety of computer-controlled opponents.</p>
<p>• Gain experience points, earn gold, and loot valuable items as you journey through treacherous dungeons.</p>
<p>• Join a clan to meet other players and forge alliances to accomplish greater  achievements.</p>
<p>• Sail the South Sea to Westbarge to check out what the pirates are selling, or ride your horse through the Stonam Plains to Lionspeak to seek advice from a wise elderly Brutan.</p>

<p>• Buy, sell, and trade items through the Auction House and Trading Post to collect rare goods or turn profits.</p>

<h3>About the game</h3>
<div>
<p>Ostrich Island is the unique mix between an adventure (<strong>explore beautiful islands and search for collectibles</strong>) and a platformer (<strong>jump over dangerous waters, run and kick different objects</strong>), with a slight hint of role-playing game (<strong>level up and gain new abilities</strong>).</p>
<p>KICK ALL THE STUFF! COLLECT ALL THE BONUSES!<br/>ESCAPE TO THE NEXT ISLAND BEFORE THE FLOOD!</p>
<p>Will be available for <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Mac</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong></p>

IndieGameMag: “Peaking Out Of The Sand ‘Ostrich Island’ Shows A Beautifully Crafted World To Explore” http://www.indiegamemag.com/peaking-out-of-the-...
GodIsAGeek: ""...the whole game is presented in an aesthetic that is pleasing to the eye and actually makes you want to stay on the island at times, instead of escaping.""http://www.godisageek.com/2012/11/20-minutes-ostrich-island/
 
UPDATE #3 (November, 5)
Sven Gerlach, a remarkable German composer and sound designer, has joined Ostrich Island project! You may expect his professional, high quality ambient sounds and sound effects will be added to the game soon.
UPDATE #2 (November, 2)
The third difficulty level for the hardcore players announced. Want the highest score? Vacation is over! Fallen trees stun you, water level raises as crazy, enemies are quicker and, to make it more fun – you have one life. Availability: Soon after the main release.
 UPDATE #1 (November, 1)
The new video shows the ideas/features recently added to the game.Watch it here: Carousel of Features and do not forget to change quality in player to HD.
 
About the game

Ostrich Island is the unique mix between an adventure (explore beautiful islands and search for collectibles) and a platformer (jump over dangerous waters, run and kick different objects), with a slight hint of role-playing game (level up and gain new abilities).
KICK ALL THE STUFF! COLLECT ALL THE BONUSES!ESCAPE TO THE NEXT ISLAND BEFORE THE FLOOD!
Will be available for Windows, Mac and Linux

Main Features

Gain experience points and upgrade your Ostrich with new skills and abilities!
Lots of collectibles and hidden bonuses. Ones found they can be closely examined in the Nest;
Two difficulty levels: ""Relaxing"", where you can slowly investigate the islands, searching for collectibles with nothing to worry about, and ""Escape"", where constantly rising water level adds some stress but increases score multipliers in return. The third level ""Hardcore"" will be added later - Want the highest score? Vacation is over! Fallen trees stun you, water level raises as crazy, enemies are quicker and, to make it more fun - you have one life.

Global leader board and country scoreboard across all platforms.

The demo version of the game is available and can be downloaded for your Windows/Mac computer (http://www.medungeon.com/Home/Download). The demo contains the first 3 islands.

Who I am
My name is Yaroslav Bakh and I am the creator and owner of MeDungeon Games, the one-man indie games studio from Finland. I have over 15 years of experience in a serious software development, building multi-tier, client/server applications. The game development is my passion and hobby, which I spent most of my free time.

Why I need your money and what you will get



The raised money will be spent on:

additional game assets (more objects to interact, more enemies to kick!);
outsourcing 3D animator, composer and sound designer work (better animation, more music and sound effects);
the game engine ""Full"" license (more eye candies, for example dynamic shadows, better looking water and fog);
additional programming work and localization (interesting extra features. More adventure elements or more platformer or RPG? Let's discuss it together!) 


Stretch goals
Stretch goals will be defined when/if this project will be successfully funded. At the moment I am thinking about the character customization, multiplayer and additional platforms. Plus, more islands!

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It bears some resemblance to Settlers: little flying Drones will carry all your resources back and forth.

When you have automated your entire colony you can just lean back in your chair and watch how your brain child takes care of itself. This is the joy of programming!</p>
<p>A key feature in the design is that the game play is never overshadowed by the programming. The game is always meant to be fun, not become a schoolbook in disguise. You are able to reach higher levels without touching the programming parts of the game. Although you can earn Programming Badges that will require you to write code. </p>
<p>The game is built in Unity, so all world graphics are in full 3D, right here in your browser. It takes place in a sci-fi setting, where you colonize planets, build and upgrade buildings and move resources between planets so every citizen can thrive. Terra-forming planets, building new and better Droids, researching new technology in the vast tech-tree and of course defending against the evil aliens and other players.</p>
<p>I try to focus the design on what is unique with this game and not so much on the graphics and similar content. Almost all of the textures and models you see are bought from various asset stores.</p>

<p>A big focus is on the programming learning curve. The first step is to just run a prewritten script. The next step is to open a piece of code and change a number.

The idea is that if you reach level 30 and have earned ten Programming Badges, you will probably be able to pass the test in a high school programming course.</p>
<p>Depending on your programming experience the hint system will let you specify how much help you need. If you are a proficient programmer you don't need to be taught what a for-loop is.</p>
<p>Get started by building a Programming Center. In that building you will find the controls for opening the Code Window.

Food buildings


12 kinds of food produced and refined in 12 different buildings. Hydroponics creates Beans. The Bean Masher turns Beans into Hummus. The Bio Chem Lab produces ""Meat"". ""Meat"" and Hummus becomes Kebab in the Kebab kitchen.


Unwanted resources


Waste of five different kinds. When the waste facilities flow over people lose happiness and the atmosphere takes damage. Really nasty waste like Uranium damages nearby buildings. On the other hand, some waste can be recycled into new resources.


Droids


Flying vehicles that are essential to getting your Colony working. Mostly they move resources from building to building, but also help upgrading them.

Send out probes in the terrain and find where the different kinds of minerals are located. Then send drones out with special mining equipment. 5 different kinds of raw materials (not all exist on all planets.) And 5 different kinds of refined material, made in 5 different kinds of buildings.


Tech-tree


A vast tech-tree with a lot of different unlocks. Buildings, droids, refinery methods, terraforming techniques, war space ships, colonization ships, spy techniques and so on. Developing one branch will make another one more expensive or lock it completely.


Scripting


Write scripts in Python and schedule when they should be started. For example, you might want to run the Empty Trash script every hour.


Internal mail


An in-box where all reports end up. Building damage, Market reports, outcomes of orbital battles, programming tutorials and so on.


Tutorials


A very low learning curve so that even players who have never written a single line of code can keep up. When the Programming Center is built every new level will give you the next chapter of the tutorial.


Programming Badges


To prove that you have been able to automate your colony, activate one of the badges. This will disable all command buttons in the game and you will not be able to issue any orders, only watch as your script does the work. Now your scripts have 24 hours to complete the task. 



Risks and Challenges
Most, if not all, of the basic features are in place. The server is up and running 24/7 and have been through some stress testing. The programming infrastructure is done. Some basic game play is implemented (and is quite fun already). So the challenges are more about finishing all the features on time and not so much about solving technical problems.

publish TimeFusion ourselves through digital channels in order to retain

video games. I think this is the magic formula for a good game.



TimeFusion is a dream project for us. We are excited
for the chance to create it and we want you to be a part of it as well.  
We need your help, so we can make the game. We will
publish TimeFusion ourselves through digital channels in order to retain
control over our project from the beginning to the end. Great thing about
crowdfunding is that we can go directly to the people who have liked our project
and would love to play it. This process allows us to create the game exactly
the way you want to see it. 
Our relationship with you can be even closer with
IndieGoGo. We can be more transparent with the development stages and give
you behind the scenes look to what goes on day-to-day with TimeFusion. We will
retain an open dialog with our supporters through the entire production.
We are
asking for your help to fund the project and to finally make our dream a
reality!





Your money will go towards building the game. To hire artists, designers, 
animators, programmers and to pay for voiceovers. To create the worlds and the 
characters. To buy hardware and software 
licenses, pay for office space and finally to 
release the game.
Your pledges are incredibly important to us. In return we pledge to 
make every dollar count, and to deliver a game we all want to play.

You will explore a post apocalyptic land forgotten by mankind, taken by the nature and ruled by the hands of ancient gods.The gameplay is focused on exploration, survival and boss battles. Take your time fishing, hunting, exploring dungeons or learning about the history of the ancient gods and civilizations. You decide how deep you will dive into the world of Soulgest  Discover the mysteries of the ancient deities or focus on your main missions to find the gods pray for them and take down the giant bosses to rebuild the Stars Route Map.The project is a dream coming to life, born from our passion for games like Legend of Zelda, Breath of Fire and so many nostalgic RPGs mixed with the survival mechanics of games like The Flame in the Flood.The word ""soulgest"" is a mix of the original word Almagestum one of the first stars catalogue and its translation Alma: Soul, and Gest: Gestum (something like heroic song). Soulgest is at the same time the Stars Map and the Song of Souls  I’m in love with ancient history and astronomy, almost 2 years ago I started to study more and collect data to create a game based on the things I most love. Sometime after the born of my son and living together with him, i slowly learnt that there is something special in non-explicit violence games something relaxing and adventurous that was always present in games from Nintendo and some ps one era rpgs.I also indentified a lack of games in this specific genre for PC users, only few ones gave me the right feeling of adventure that i was searching for, with this in mind Soulgest began to take shape, from top down pixel art, to isometric 3d and then to the actual third person view. In the process of creating the prototypes only when i got the third person angles working i could achieve the sense of greatness and loneliness i was aiming for.    A Free WorldSoulgest combine a free world exploration with survival mechanics and boss battles based on strategy and observation of the enemy behavior. Your main quest is to defeat the bosses who represent the constellations in different cultures like Orion, Nimrod, Sirius and Kesil.You can choose any boss or quest in any order and start to explore, but you will need to prepare yourself for the travel, think about your backpack size, take water and food to survive in the wilderness. Backpack ManagementOne of the most important items in Soulgest is your backpack, you will need it to carry anything more than little sticks. You can find (rarely) or craft your own backpack in different models and sizes, each model will have different number of slots for items and quick-slots for your tools. Be PreparedBe well prepared for the travels is the best strategy to survive the lands of Xaartus, before going on a mission be sure to collect some information about the place you will go, talk to drifters, survivors or find documents that tells you a little about the new place you will discoverStudy about the climate, wild life and history of the land and you will know what to carry and  what to fear. Survive While your main goal is to defeat the bosses you will have to survive all the journey till you find your objective. You will need to gather fruits or hunt animals to eat, search for consumable water and stay warm. Lit Your FireBonfires are essential to keep you alive, in them you can cook food and boil water to prevent ills or infections. Bonfires keep you warm in the night and keep animals away while you sleep. Build Your ShelterBy building a shelter you can be safe from rain and cold. There are different levels of shelter that you can build. Temporary shelters last only one night but require less ressources, definitive shelters can be used as fast travel points, upgrade a shelter to a cabin will let you create craft tables, item chests and much more. Any new upgrade after that will put you closer of a community and that is what you need to recruit survivors to help you, any new survivor will need a room in the house to enter to your team.    Combat system in Soulgest work similar to games like Legend of Zelda BOTW and Dark Souls. You will need to pay attention to the enemies moves and behaviors and be ready to dodge and attack in the right time. While small enemies and animals would deal little damage large enemies and furious animals will kill you with little effort if you were not well prepared and equiped. While you can use any weapon or tool to attack, some enemies will not be hurted by normal weapons, you cant expect a little wood plank to deal any significant damage in something made of dark matter. EquipmentAll of your equipment need to be crafted, swords, tools, clothes, crossbows and armors. As well all equipments are breakable and can be fixed up to three times before it broke definitely. You will have tools like axes, pickaxes and hammers as well as weapons like swords, battle axes and crosbows. Your character will need better or specific armors to explore parts of the world,  you will also need to think about your clothes to stay safe from the cold and from the extreme heat.Ranged weapons are among the tools you can create. Your crossbows will be important to hunt silently, interrupt attacks and to use status changing attacks.  LootWhen you run out of food, medicine or weapons, do not fear being rude, search the houses, the dead and the graves. Sooner or later you will be alone and without anything at hand, search every house for straps, old mechanic parts or maybe a simple roof to sleep. Tomb RaidThrough the lands of Xaartus you will find various dungeons and caves, in those places you can find loot, resources and learn more about the history of the world. Discover monoliths and old scrolls that remains from a time most ancient than the gods. A New LanguageIn order to read the monoliths and scrolls left by ancient people, first you will need to learn their language. Each old text or artifact will teach you new words till you can fully understand the languages and find the truth! HuntingThere are your personal everyday hunts and contract hunts. You will need to use traps and stealth to catch your daily prey in order to eat but Contract Hunts are all around the world in boards in villages or ruins or from other npcs around the world. Sometimes the hunt contract is from ages ago found in ruins of a cave but if the prey still alive the hunt continues.   In the world of Soulgest you will find another survivors, some of them will become merchants or take another roles in the camps. But you will also find companions who will enter to you party and help you in your missions.  You can choose one companion at time to help you in some missions or boss fights, they may not follow you all the time, but in specific areas you can shoot a flare and ask them for help.  Initially we plan four companions, two males and two females. Each companion will have their own weapon and clothes or armor that are exclusive for them, their equipment will not have such variety as Noah equipments instead they will have exclusive status and skills like higher physical strenght, better ranged weapons, buffs and debuffs.  MountsIn Soulgest you will find one mount for each area of the world, camels in the desert, horses in the field, goats for the moutains, deers for forest, snow moutains and another areas. To earn the mount you will need to complete a quest first, after that the mount will be yours but it will need a place to rest. By building a barn your mount will have where to comeback if it stay alone for too much time or if it dies on the travel. You can create barns in all of your camps if you upgrade it to the right level, if you dont have a barn the mount will come back to its ""born place""  • Open World Exploration (discover the mysteries of the gods of the first men and the fallen constellations) • Survival (survive the hunger, thirst and cold)• Crafting and Gathering (craft tools, weapons and armors, logging, mining)• Boss Battles (defeat the giant old kings and take the stars) • Hunting (take hunts across the world, animals, creatures and who knows what more) • Fishing (travel the lands to find fishing spots and secret fishes)• Village Building (new craft tools in your house, merchants in the village) • Mounts (find the right mount for each area, camel, horse, deer, goat and more) • Companions (find survivors to help you in missions and boss fights)• Farming (plant seeds and general goods to save food, make traps or feed animals.   The mankind followed its journey to the future, evolving and pushing the earth to its ruin, and after the devastation of the planet they turned their eyes to the stars. And then the space exodus began, time after time, spaceship after spaceship left the earth through the wormholes, leaving behind thousands abandoned to survive in a devastated world…but they left a last gift to the forgotten people on earth a crack in the space time……The Supermassive Horizon….With the Supermassive Horizon the stars began to fall on earth and the ancient gods rose again… … and after them something even ancestral, something worshiped even by the gods themselves…the primordial deities…the personifications of the own constellations of the first men.  The LandXaartus, a land once inhabited by diverse human societies in a distorted place where once could have been the caucasus and the levant. Today, centuries after the horizon coming and the time-space convergence this land became the central point of the supermassive-horizon expansion and the only place on earth where the ancient constellations rose againYou will travel through a land of fantasy mixed with history and legends. Each area is based on real locations and ancient civilizations. You will find Celtic forest guarded by the horned gods, grasslands covered by ruins and Henges of the megalithic age, snow mountains touched by the old Nordics, deserts watched by YHWH and others by Sirius, Babylonian ruins, Sumerian Tablets and the ruins of the own contemporary mankind.     In the world of Soulgest the humankind had already gone, only few villages and drifters left. When the stars started to fall on earth people began to be flowded by the dark matter and the singularity. Those creatures once humans are called Voids, in your way you can find simple...almost human voids and other very massive as Ergo. When a new star falls on earth there are a chance for one of its fragments hit a void, when this happens the void become a Shard an armored enemy with cristalyzed star shards covering parts of his body. Shards can evolve with the star power and become Shells a very powerfull and aggressive version with all his body covered by the fragments. Non_VoidsIn the furthest lands you will also find different kind of enemies as the Giants the descendants of the fallen titans.  AnimalsWhen traveling trought the wilds you need to be aware of wild animals, wolves and boars will attack you and certainly kill you if you are not armed. You will also find rabbits, turtles, birds that you can capture to use its leather or food. Music and VoicesSoulgest music is hard for me to explain, you are in a post apocalyptic world at the edge of humanity, but you are also in and amazing land, with beatifull nature, you are surrouded by the dangers of the wild life and by something ancestral than the gods and at the same time you are delighted by the lands of Xaartus.This is the team responsible to give life to something born from our deepest dreams with amazing songs and voice acting. Composer: Alan MonteiroForest Theme - by Alan Monteiro Composer: Andrei ShulgachMain Theme Voice Actress: Tarsila Bazilio  Platforms  The planned release of Soulgest is to October 2019 and Nintendo Switch version some months later in the beginning of 2020.  Playstation 4 and X Box One versions depends if we reach the strecth goals for consoles.

Explore their innards, discover the sources of each infection and neutralize them! Each disease offers up unique challenges, enemies, and objectives to get those poor creatures right as rain again.  The player can swap between characters on the fly to make the most out of every situation. Each crew member brings a unique play style and set of abilities to the team to help make strategic combos against the enemy & enhance your care-giving quotient!  We're big fans of 90s-era combat platformers, and especially inspired by games like Mega Man X, Metal Slug, and the Metroid series. Blubber Busters is a game that will embrace their spirit, but with an added punch! As the station's janitor, Rudy's job mainly consists of burning off space barnacles from oncoming ships with his trusty modified utility torch.  Rudy’s flamethrower is great for dealing with low health swarming enemies and for clearing away goopy obstacles at a safe distance. Not to mention has in interesting way of jump jetting his way over pits and traps. Resident cook at the food truck outside the clinic, Eva spent her free time building a surgical suit to get the attention of the head doctor. Since tradegy struck, she's now one of the staff.Eva’s syringe claws slice through hardened armored enemies and obstacles. She's also far more maneuverable with dashes and double jumps. In a distant solar system, humans and space whales live in harmony among the stars. Whales provide transport across the galaxy, access to exotic resources, and much-needed companionship. In return they only ask that we keep them healthy. Easy, right? We... have our work cut out for us. For being such an ancient species living in deep space they're not too bright. Most steer themselves to Space Veterinary Centers that orbit the largest planets for medical help and loving care.But over a years time, most centers have gone dark. Now, the only one left manned by misfits and the center’s janitor, Rudy, and wannabe doctor, Eva, must save the burdensome beasts from infectious threats to their species.Fight your way into a world packed with guts, eccentric aliens and quack doctors! As you race to save every patient that comes to your door, a sinister plot unfolds…  Players treat four whales in the system on the journey to cure a new space whale disease. The order players choose to complete levels will create sicker & more difficult versions of the later chosen whales. The order levels are chosen to defeat will create one of several variants of a final level, and ending in an extra dimensional whale. Your space station acts as a HUB between missions, and also serves as the setting for the first mission of the game.  The many combat and platforming levels of Blubber Busters are the actual goopy innards of space whales! Space whales have problems -- Lots of problems -- bizarre bacteria, pesky parasites, and more will fight your team until they’re all cleared out of your patient.  Each afflicted whale effectively works as a single stage with its own set of problems & objectives you need to solve to help get it happy and healthy again. A whale with a stomach ache may have a parasite infection having you burning through heaps of gooey blockage, and forcing your team to wipe out swaths of nasty critters before taking on their queen.   Another might have a malfunctioning pacemaker bigger than a house and now it’s security bots have become deadly. You’d have to reboot it’s systems and jerry rig some systems to give you access, all the while surviving the deadly bots! It's up to you to fix 'em up. Our composer, Chris Christodoulou, known for Risk of Rain, Deadbolt and Risk of Rain 2 - will be joining us to compose the soundtrack for Blubber Busters! You can listen to some of his previously released tracks here!  All of our budget will go into contracting a programmer & additional art support for things like animation, rigging, SFX and VFX.  While our base game is something we can make with our 50k goal, our stretch goals will expand the amount of levels, platforms, game modes, characters, stories and more that we can add in the future.  
The GameGet a digital PC copy (PC/Steam) of Blubber Busters! All backers will be able to choose on which platform (out of the unlocked release platforms) they'll receive their codes.
Digital Art BookCharacter art, enemy iterations, level designs, full page spreads of colorful rivers of bodily fluids - this book has it all!
Early Beta Access + DiscordPlay the game before anyone else! Help give our team feedback and make the game the best it can be.
Physical Art BookIt's the art book... but you can hold it on your hands! Digital-world cyber-beings need not apply; this is only for us creatures of flesh and bone.
Name & Portrait in the gameThere are tons of dead surgeons in space whales these days, but oddly enough not many with names... until now. You can be one of these dead surgeons with a unique story of how you kicked the bucket.
Design an NPCWhat's more exciting than talking to an NPC? Talking to one that you helped create! Become one with the lore or just mop up the floor.

<p>We want to as many people as possible to experience the thrilling experiences generated from this project, but we can not do that without help from the community.  We need better equipment, proper licenses and the ability to pay our team of developers to achieve this groundbreaking goal.  We care about our community, and above that, our loyal fans.  We want to deliver on our promise to give them an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p>My name is Austin Handle and I'm the Project Lead for ""The Legend"".  I've had several years of experience in the CryEngine 2 &amp; 3.  A couple of years ago, I wrote and developed the first functional code and system for a cooperative play system in the CryEngine, before passing the project off to a larger team.  I'm confident that any interest in this project will grow as you see our work, where we've been and where we're going.  Whether that be from our Lead Composer, David, our Executive producer, Christian, or any other essential member of our team.</p>

<h3>What's ""The Legend"" about exactly?</h3>
<p>""The Legend"" will ultimately consist of numerous urban legends, horrors, common fears and some unique stories.  Players will experience many different aspects of these legends and stories from many different angles.  For example: a baby, a teenager or an elderly citizen, etc.</p>
<p>This allows for us dive deeper into the psychology behind these horrific experiences and deliver a variety of bone-chilling experiences.  </p>
<p>In example, a teenager would be able to use a cellphone as their main utility tool (a flashlight, contacting help, etc.), however, this life-saving tool could also be their downfall by giving away their position and receiving paranormal interference.  On the other end of the spectrum, an elderly citizen could be using a cane or wheelchair as their utility tool for quicker movement, however, there aren't many happy-ending horror games where the player is trying to escape using a cane.</p>
<p>We're also researching and developing random world generation (a totally innovative concept for horror games), which will allow for the player to never experience the same stories even if they are the same legends.  Thus, prolonging the entertainment period gained from this game.</p>

<li>Stealth - Killing is never an option. The only thing that can guarantee your success, let alone your survival, is your ability to outsmart those who would do you harm.</li>
<li>Exploration - Dive into an intricately designed, open world, cyberpunk metropolis and meet the shadowy inhabitants ready to help, hire, or kill you in the four districts of Arachnopolis.</li>
<li>Discovery - As you search the neon city for a way out of the conflict that's destroyed your life, uncover the truth behind the city, its shady inhabitants, and the Interferers themselves.</li>
</ul>

THE GAME


Interference is a stealth puzzle-platformer set in the tech-noir city of Arachnopolis, a place where citizens' rights have been replaced by totalitarianism, oppression, and a robotic police force. Gameplay in Interference has four key aspects:
Manipulation - Adapt and shift the architecture of Arachnopolis to your advantage as you solve puzzles and outwit your foes.
Stealth - Killing is never an option. The only thing that can guarantee your success, let alone your survival, is your ability to outsmart those who would do you harm.
Exploration - Dive into an intricately designed, open world, cyberpunk metropolis and meet the shadowy inhabitants ready to help, hire, or kill you in the four districts of Arachnopolis.
Discovery - As you search the neon city for a way out of the conflict that's destroyed your life, uncover the truth behind the city, its shady inhabitants, and the Interferers themselves.






Some of the works that have influenced the development of Interference include movies like Blade Runner, Dark City, Brazil, and Akira, the novel Flashback by Dan Simmons,and games like Shenmue, Metal Gear Solid, Flashback, and Deus Ex, particularly for their balance between action, exploration, and storytelling.

MORE DETAILS


About the Playground: Arachnopolis

Interference isn't just another stealth platformer in the style of Mark of the Ninja, Gunpoint, or Stealth Bastard. I love these games, but I want to create my own with a fully-realized and immersive universe that's free from the boundaries of defined levels.
In Interference, like in Metroidvanias, players freely explore the city of Arachnopolis while progressively unlocking access to more districts and eventually gaining entry to the entire city.

About the Storyline






It all seemed like a regular night of work. 
You're sitting in your apartment droning at the computer when suddenly a blackout sweeps the entire area. You go to the roof to check the main generator. As you approach, you see someone standing in front of it.
Who is he? What is he doing?
You don't get the chance to find out. 
 As soon as he sees you he's gone, and seconds later a robotic police unit descends and arrests you for causing the blackout.
You don't know it yet, but your only way out is with the cyberterrorist group known as the Interferers.






About the Gameplay

1- Stealth-oriented platformer






Interference is a stealth game. Your main weapons are your agility and your intelligence. 
2- Puzzle mechanics






One of Interference's main gameplay mechanics is the ability to modify the city's architecturewith a tool called the Glitcher. The Glitcher needs to be connected to a network terminal in order to be activated.It lets you:
Re-design parts of the world in order to create exits and escape routes
Make permanent alterations to the city's architecture.
Connect to networks in order to read and rewrite data packages.

... but when you're using the Glitcher, you're opening yourself up to virtual attacks.

3- Adventure




While most of your initial missions will come from the Interferers, as the game progresses you'll start dealing with a wider variety of people, including Quantic Girls, Ergs, Holoers, and more.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Doing something useful and unique was always my passion, recent application is a KidReadler, an easy way to learn reading for kids: <a href=""https://kidreadler.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://kidreadler.com/</a> . Yeah, having kids make you think differently as you watch the learning progress and what is good, or bad.</p>
<p>The new idea is not going out of my head for some time already, definitely can do a world better with it.</p>
<p>The thing is... to learn and quiz anything. With just a few basic lessons but with ability to create your own, and share.</p>
<p>Just imagine this:</p>
<ul>
<li>you as a student have to learn 30 Spanish words</li>
<li>you launch application, create a word and translation to it</li>
<li>you learn it</li>
<li>you pass the quiz</li>
<li>you pass the quiz again, watch your progress over time</li>
<li>you share this lesson with other students from your class so they can do same</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564574795/zk0aomlfg2lbimqln8ou.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Or another, you as a teacher do basic multiply praxis, 2*2, 2*5, 3*7 , you share it with a class and kids are learning it (yeah, we all know kids are addicted to phones).</p>
<p>The point is that you can create a lesson about ANYTHING you want, learn it, quiz it and share it eazily over QR-code or in any social network (facebook, whatsup, twitter). Any language, any questions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564574763/tf71if1zut07owhejjj0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</div><div>
<p>Comparing to previous application this project will not be that simple, interacting over webserver and working on different platforms requires some investing which I am not able to do myself. While it should be professionally made, including custom templates and skins etc. The usability and GUI should be great, that will make it successful app.</p>
<p>For sure going in a fixed goal, only when reached can start doing it. It should be done good, or not started at all :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>--</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Prototyped it a lot in my head, but also in special software. Some highlights:</p>
<p>Creating the lesson and learning process</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564576087/wmnjunuwe80faewvtznf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Taking the quiz and watching progress results</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564575478/tmjkdd01misytwrlxckl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Remember, quiz anything you ever need, countries and capitals here</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564575621/lf5l4d4c3qaptm5xtwth.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I mean absolutely anything you ever can imagine!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Not a one-time project, but one for years. Going to make it great so definitely need further incomes . I hate ads, however that will be a main income after application become alive.

<p>Few sections needed to be built:</p>
<p>- an application itself, android and iOS ready</p>

<p>- a group of testers, perfectly students of teachers</p>

<p>There are things you can do to make the project better. As it is still in 'thinking of it' state I accept any input. Write what you think about it, propose your vision how it could be better.<br/>Know someone interested? Share this page :)</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Doing something useful and unique was always my passion, recent application is a KidReadler, an easy way to learn reading for kids: https://kidreadler.com/ . Yeah, having kids make you think differently as you watch the learning progress and what is good, or bad.
The new idea is not going out of my head for some time already, definitely can do a world better with it.
The thing is... to learn and quiz anything. With just a few basic lessons but with ability to create your own, and share.
Just imagine this:

you as a student have to learn 30 Spanish words
you launch application, create a word and translation to it
you learn it
you pass the quiz
you pass the quiz again, watch your progress over time
you share this lesson with other students from your class so they can do same


 
Or another, you as a teacher do basic multiply praxis, 2*2, 2*5, 3*7 , you share it with a class and kids are learning it (yeah, we all know kids are addicted to phones).
The point is that you can create a lesson about ANYTHING you want, learn it, quiz it and share it eazily over QR-code or in any social network (facebook, whatsup, twitter). Any language, any questions.

 What We Need & What You Get
Comparing to previous application this project will not be that simple, interacting over webserver and working on different platforms requires some investing which I am not able to do myself. While it should be professionally made, including custom templates and skins etc. The usability and GUI should be great, that will make it successful app.
For sure going in a fixed goal, only when reached can start doing it. It should be done good, or not started at all :)
 
--

The Impact
Prototyped it a lot in my head, but also in special software. Some highlights:
Creating the lesson and learning process

Taking the quiz and watching progress results

Remember, quiz anything you ever need, countries and capitals here

I mean absolutely anything you ever can imagine!

And yes, those above are just prototypes how it should be. Colored version is below

No need to use phone for same actions, use a website to create/analyze/watch results

Share lessons easily

<h2>Introducing the Next Evolution in Fantasy + Football</h2>
<p><img alt=""Iron Rivals Logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/KUYJ5KH.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Iron Rivals is a fantasy-themed strategy game where players fight over territory using legendary heroes who clash in head-to-head combat. The outcomes of the battles are determined by football statistics, streamed in real-time as professional football games unfold.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What makes Iron Rivals special?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Iconic heroes with unique backstories, rendered in our gritty, fantasy art style</li>
<li>Interactive game map where players strategically launch attacks, defense and manage their empire; the player with the most territory at the end of the football season wins!</li>
<li>Matchups happen between heroes, not between teams as in other fantasy sports; heroes are deployed alone or in combination, creating new and dramatic combat scenarios every week</li>
<li>Integration with live statistics; watch battles between heroes unfold as the football game stats are generated</li>
<li>Extensive list of alternate rules and game options (see Roadmap) to enhance the strategy gameplay and give league administrators total control</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Why do we need your support?</strong></h3>
<p>Iron Rivals has a very well-defined deadline. It needs to be stable, fast, fun and ready to play by the start of fantasy football drafts in August and the first kickoff in early September. </p>
<p>Having the game ready means greatly increasing artwork production and development over the next three months. </p>
<p>Most of the money will go to pay concept artists to create heroes, developers to create the game and fantasy football features, and to pay for support services (like accurate, live statistics) that are required to make Iron Rivals everything that we want it to be. </p>
<p>Your support is essential to ensure that Iron Rivals is ready for Fall 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>""I want to contribute, but what if you don't reach your funding goal?""</strong></h3>
<p>We've chosen a ""fixed funding"" campaign, which means that we do not receive any contributions unless we reach our goal. When you contribute, IndieGoGo collects he money immediately, but will refund the funds if the project does not reach its target. </p>
<p>This ensures that supporters can feel confident about contributing, with no risk of losing money to a project that does not come to fruition.</p>

<p>Every draftable player in professional football will have a hero alter-ego. Popular heroes will have custom portraits (contributors vote on which players receive custom artwork), while other heroes will draw from a pool of hero portraits. The more money we raise, the more custom portraits we can create. </p>
<p>Over time we aim to have custom artwork for most players in professional football.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Overview of Gameplay</h2>
</div>
<p>Iron Rivals will have a rhythm very familiar to fantasy football veterans. Players create leagues and invite friends or colleagues in order to compete against each other.</p>
<p>Heroes are drafted using common fantasy football draft mechanics, or hero rosters can be manually set up by the league admin (if you want to import draft selections from another fantasy football site).</p>
<p>Strategic actions are submitted on the days between professional football games, usually Tuesday and Wednesday. Heroes can be deployed alone or in combination to attack and defend territories. </p>
<p>After Wednesday, matchups between heroes are finalized and ready for resolution during the football games, which can run from Thursday through Monday evening. Statistics from the live games are streamed to the site in real time so you can watch the combat unfold as the football players (and their associated heroes) perform on the field. </p>
<p><img alt=""Concept Game Map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/0W3up33.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Game map concept</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a week's games are complete, winners are declared, territories change hands and the war continues. </p>
<p>The game will run for the entirety of the regular season (17 weeks) and a winner - the player who owns the most territory - will be declared after the last games are played. </p>
<p>Thoughtful deployment of your heroes, combined with tactful manipulation of your opponents (alliances are encouraged!), will set you up for victory. That said, there are always surprises on the football field, and those amazing feats (and fumbles) will have big effects on the outcomes of battles.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Will the game be free?</strong></em></p>
<p>Creating basic leagues will be 100% free. The site will feature advertising, but players have the option of removing ads for a small one-time, per-season fee. Additional features may include additional fees, but our goal is to keep the game as open and low-cost as possible. </p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Did you know that Brian Urlacher no longer plays for the Bears?</strong></em></p>
<p>We do! The news came after we created Ur-Lak, but we don't mind the change. The bear pelt on his back now serves as an symbol of revenge which, if you ask us, is more interesting anyway.</p>
<p>Players changing teams is a reality of professional sports and we'll continue to create and update our hero artwork with this in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>I noticed defensive players among the heroes. Will you support both individual defensive players (IDP) and team defense?</strong></em></p>
<p>We have plans to support both IDP and team defense options, but will likely pursue the individual defensive player model first as it fits more closely with the hero-centric focus of Iron Rivals' gameplay. We also have plans to accommodate more defensive positions, such as punters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Aren't you appealing to two very different types of people?</em></strong></p>
<p>Our research, combined with our own interests, has shown that there are a lot of people out there who enjoy fantasy-themed movies, video games and TV shows who also enjoy a good football game.</p>
<p>The days of jocks vs. D&amp;D nerds are long gone. Now everyone is free to pursue all of their interests regardless of how different they may be. Plus, we like the idea that we're bridging two different spaces in a way that may create both new football fans and new fans of the fantasy genre. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Some of the heroes look a lot like their player counterparts. Are you worried about running into legal issues?</em></strong></p>
<p>Our heroes are definitely creative works of fiction, but we absolutely respect each player's right of publicity and power to control how his likeness is used. </p>
<p>Our intention is to nurture fandom, both of football and of the hard-working players in its ranks. We expect to tweak and adjust the artwork as needed to do right by both the fans and the professional football players.</p>

<h2>A company that didn't just make games, but made games by gamers, for gamers.</h2>
<p>This great company once released more games per year than EA was on everyone's lips. They gave birth to companies like Bioware, and gave the guys who now run Obsidian their first jobs in the industry. Their games included Decent, Warcraft, Fallout, and Planescape: Torment.</p>
<p>But dark times came to this company, and the empire began to crumble. A pair of saviours rode in, but their attempts to revive here were flaunted by misstep after misstep.</p>
<p>But perhaps.... Perhaps now in her darkest hour, she can be saved!</p>
<p>Interplay Entertainment was one of the biggest names in gaming, but now her share price languishes at a penny per share.</p>
<h2>With 124.3 Million shares outstanding, this means we just need 1.243 million to buy every share at today's closing price!</h2>
<h2>But we don't need that many. We only need half plus 1, at current prices this will cost  about 600k</h2>
<p>I propose we raise a bit more.  Firstly, we need 1.2 Million to buy at least half the shares at twice their current price - 2 cents per share.  Given this is a 100% premium on current prices, it makes an attractive deal for investors.</p>
<p>Indiegogo want about 10%, thats about 200k</p>
<p>The remaining 600k we'll use for working capital to help breath life in the old girl, or in case a few shareholders hang out for 3 cents per share.</p>
<h3>Once we secure her, the road is a little less certain, it depends on what level of mess we find her in.</h3>
<h3>Hopefully, it wont be that bad and we can try and sell her to Brian Fargo - maybe he'd like his brand back?</h3>
<h3>We could try and make a game with what little silverware is left.</h3>
<h3>if worst comes to worst we can give the old lady the funeral she deserves, rather than suffer her ongoing mistreatment.</h3>
<p>I know this is a big task... But unlike most of these crowdsource fundraisers, we actually have something right now - its not some game we might or might not end up making, or its not access to some super secret forum we might or might not put up - we have an actual company that still owns stuff, and still sells games.</p>
<h3>And if we don't make enough money, we'll simply not take the cash from you. I bet thats the best deal you've heard all week.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>What do you know about running a Game company?</h2>
<p>Well, Interplay is famous for that ""By gamers, for gamer"" line, well, we're gamers!</p>
<p>Here's a list of reasons why we're better than the current management</p>
<ol>
<li>Noone involved in the Save Interplay campaign ever worked on Superman 64</li>
<li>Noone involved in the Save Interplay campaign has ever had a Bankruptcy order served upon them, or to any companies they run</li>
<li>Noone involved in the Save Interplay campaign ever worked on Fallout:Brotherhood of Steel</li>

But dark times came to this company, and the empire began to crumble. A pair of saviours rode in, but their attempts to revive here were flaunted by misstep after misstep.
But perhaps.... Perhaps now in her darkest hour, she can be saved!
Interplay Entertainment was one of the biggest names in gaming, but now her share price languishes at a penny per share.
With 124.3 Million shares outstanding, this means we just need 1.243 million to buy every share at today's closing price!
But we don't need that many. We only need half plus 1, at current prices this will cost  about 600k
I propose we raise a bit more.  Firstly, we need 1.2 Million to buy at least half the shares at twice their current price - 2 cents per share.  Given this is a 100% premium on current prices, it makes an attractive deal for investors.
Indiegogo want about 10%, thats about 200k
The remaining 600k we'll use for working capital to help breath life in the old girl, or in case a few shareholders hang out for 3 cents per share.
Once we secure her, the road is a little less certain, it depends on what level of mess we find her in.
Hopefully, it wont be that bad and we can try and sell her to Brian Fargo - maybe he'd like his brand back?
We could try and make a game with what little silverware is left.
if worst comes to worst we can give the old lady the funeral she deserves, rather than suffer her ongoing mistreatment.
I know this is a big task... But unlike most of these crowdsource fundraisers, we actually have something right now - its not some game we might or might not end up making, or its not access to some super secret forum we might or might not put up - we have an actual company that still owns stuff, and still sells games.
And if we don't make enough money, we'll simply not take the cash from you. I bet thats the best deal you've heard all week.
 
What do you know about running a Game company?
Well, Interplay is famous for that ""By gamers, for gamer"" line, well, we're gamers!
Here's a list of reasons why we're better than the current management

Noone involved in the Save Interplay campaign ever worked on Superman 64
Noone involved in the Save Interplay campaign has ever had a Bankruptcy order served upon them, or to any companies they run

<p>Aliens, UFOs – are they real? After years of research, Ufologists have answered this question, and the answer is...maybe. This is where you come in. Gather evidence, get your Doctorate, hack your opponent's computer, then – perhaps – you will solve one of the World's greatest mysteries: Are we alone in the universe?</p>

<p>Ufology is a card game based on the fringe scientific field of the same name. In Ufology, players use Research cards to collect Evidence cards from a 3x3 card grid (3x4 in 5-6 player games) called the Field of Research. Those Evidence cards, ranging in value from 0 to 6 points, are placed with Case cards that have corresponding icons. When a Case has the indicated pieces of evidence, it is considered Closed. The game ends as soon as a player closes 3 Cases, and the player with the most points wins.</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39051923/Ufocard1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>Action cards allow players to, for instance, take cards from an opponent's hand, move cards from one Case to another, etc. There are also Credentials cards that increase the number of cards a player may use on their turn or their hand size, and Culture cards which change the game play for all players. The game has over 200 cards in three deck and, depending on the number of players, takes 15-45 minutes to play.</p>
