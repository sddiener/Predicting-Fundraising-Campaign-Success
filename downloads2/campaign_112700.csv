<h3>My name is Joe Cawley. I live in the hills of Tenerife (Canary Islands) with my family and other wildlife. The goats are no relation... despite rumours to the contrary.</h3>
<p>I'm a freelance travel writer and my work has appeared in many publications including The Sunday Times, Conde Nast Traveller, New York Post and Taipei Times.</p>
<p>My first book, More Ketchup than Salsa, was a humorous portrayal of moving overseas in the hope that the grass turns out to be greener. By the way, it wasn't, it was just mowed differently. The book was voted 'Best Travel Narrative' by the British Guild of Travel Writers and hit the #1 spot in Travel and in Humour in the UK.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is about funding Even More Ketchup than Salsa, the  sequel that carries on from where the first Ketchup left off, and is not just about writing the book, it's about proving that traditionally published authors don't need the old school publishing system anymore and that it's possible to go indie and do it yourself.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me put one over on 'the old school'!</p>

<p>To publish Even More Ketchup than Salsa as a solo venture, I'll need around $6,500, the bulk of which will be used in professional editing, graphic design for the cover, marketing, postage and a print run.</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>In return for contributing to this project, there are various perks on offer, depending on the level of funding. At the least you will get an early version e-book, gifted and sent with a personal message from me to you plus a personal thanks via twitter. Or a signed paperback if you up the ante slightly. You can also get your name printed on a special 'Thanks to you' page in the book; or at the front of the book as one of my select 'Book Angels'.

<div>
<p>Your contribution will not only just help me achieve my goal, but will also blaze a trail for many other frustrated writers (perhaps you) who have previously had the door slammed in their face by traditional publishers.

<h3 align=""center"">Introduction</h3>
<p>Hello! I’m Jean Ciborowski Fahey, PhD.</p>
<p>        I’m raising money to self-publish a unique book called ...</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong><em> </em></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong><em>Make Way for Reading - </em></strong></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em><strong>a story guide </strong><strong>for parents </strong><strong>of babies and young children</strong></em></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 90px;""> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 120px;"">This book is in response </h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">to the alarmingly high number of our children</h2>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 90px;"">who are not learning to read !!!</h2>
<p>Why do I know this? I know this because for 4 decades I watched more and more children arrive at school unprepared to learn to read, fall behind and rarely catch up.</p>
<p>I taught graduate school at Lesley University and spent 15 years at a Harvard teaching hospital assessing and learning from young children with reading difficulties. Working with Boston Center for Homeless Families, I also saw, close up, how poverty hijacks the reading development of even the brightest of children. </p>
<p><strong>Parents Make the Difference</strong>. Guided by exciting research in early brain development, we now know that when parents learn simple yet fun things to do in their children's first 5 years of life, children arrive at school much better prepared to learn to read and succeed. Thus, I began to deliver early literacy seminars to parents-to-be at a community hospital.   </p>
<p><strong>In my current position as an Early Literacy Research Specialis</strong>t, I work with a nonprofit that promotes early literacy in thousands of pediatric exam rooms. Serving more than 4 million children across the US, mostly low-income and poor, 28,000 pediatric medical providers advise parents about the importance of reading aloud in the first 5 years of their childrens' lives and distribute almost 7 million free books a year to babies and young children!</p>
<h2>What’s This Unique Book About?</h2>
<p><strong><em>Make Way for Reading </em></strong>brings science and story together in a carefully crafted rhymed picture book. </p>
<p>It’s about how one little girl gets ready for a lifelong adventure of reading. The story follows Eva from infancy to first grade as she learns to read with the important people in her life (including the family dog!)  </p>
<h1>What Does the Book Look Like?</h1>
<p>          <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/456151/pictures/original/20120923134053-SamplePageRotated.jpg?1348432858"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>As you open the book, the right page tells the story of a child as she learns to read.</p>
<p>On the left page is a message about what children need from us to get ready to learn to read.</p>
<h2><strong>Who Is This Book For?</strong></h2>
<p>The book is designed to inspire, teach and entertain grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, teachers and any fan of a young child- age birth to five.</p>
<h3><em><strong>But it is especially written for parents ...</strong></em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Parents-to-be</li>
<li>Busy parents</li>
<li>Immigrant parents</li>
<li>Parents who love to read</li>
<li>Parents who rarely read</li>
<li>Parents who do not read</li>
</ul><p>And because it's in rhyme, it's also a wonderful story to read aloud to a toddler, preschooler and kindergartener on the verge of reading!</p>
<h1>Why is This Book Needed?</h1>
<h3>This book is a wake up call to parents.</h3>
<p>More than half of America’s 4<sup>th</sup> graders are behind in reading, and many of these children never catch up!</p>
<p>During my 15 years assessing hundreds of poor readers, I learned the neuroscience that pointed to this exciting finding:</p>
<div>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Face time with parents — especially in a child’s first 5 years — is extremely important for building the neural pathways in the brain for learning to read.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<p>The science is clear. Even the tiniest of babies are programmed to listen and look for their parents' voices and faces. And when parents put down their cell phones or computers and respond with intention (i.e., eye contact, smiles, talking, reading, word play), the young brain forms crucial connections for learning to read.  </p>
<h3>Now, encouraged by so many of you, I created a <em>story</em> as a way to educate parents and others about all they can do to get our little ones ready to read and succeed.</h3>
<h1>Is there a demand for this book?</h1>
<p><strong>The text has been field-tested.</strong> As a national speaker on early literacy, I haven taken this story on the road. In my capacity as a university professor and early literacy research specialist, I speak at many conferences, such as the International Reading Association, National Association for the Education of Young Children, National Center for Family Literacy, National Conference on Homeless Families and National Association for Family Child Care. I also address Rotaries, libraries, high schools, literacy events, adult basic education classes, and companies with employees who are also parents/grandparents of babies and young children. </p>
<p><strong>There is a demand for this book.</strong> At these gatherings, I present a slide show of the story. Volunteers in the room take turns reading each page aloud. By the end of the 13-page story, the audience invariably expresses a collective “a-ha!” as they grasp the difference parents and others can make. Requests for the book – from parents, early educators, caregivers and even policy makers – have been so numerous, I decided to self-publish. </p>
<h1>What’s the Status of this project?</h1>
<p><strong>I’ve already begun prototyping the book.</strong> I have taken the initial steps to produce this book. Two talented professionals – an accomplished children's book illustrator Peter Thornton - (<em>Everybody Cooks Rice</em> series, Carol Rhoda Books); and a wonderful book designer, Elizabeth Dipalma– are working together and have produced sample spreads that can be seen in the video. </p>
<h1>The Grand Plan</h1>
<h3>With your investments, my trusted team and the beautifully illustrated published book in hand,</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>I will be looking for a socially conscious corporate sponsor to buy the book and pay for subsequent printing costs.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>In this way, I will be able to distribute the book free of charge to programs that work with families of young children.</strong></h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Parent educators and early education teachers may be happy to know my intention to produce a CD of the book (for large group literacy events) and to translate the parent messages into Spanish and other languages.</h3>
</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h1>What I’m Looking For and What You Get in Return</h1>
<p>I’m raising $15,000 to cover illustration, book design, printing, promotion and shipping costs. Everything you pledge will go toward these costs as well as Indiegogo fees.</p>
<p>Illustration and book design costs              $5,000</p>
<p>Printing (limited 1<sup>st</sup> edition)                        $3,000</p>
<p>Promotion, legal, tee shirt, shipping costs    $7,000</p>
<h3>If I raise additional funds ...</h3>
<p>I will create a CD of the book ASAP so parent educators can use it with groups of parents at literacy events; and</p>
<p>teachers can use it with groups of pre-K children and their parents.</p>
<h3>Extra funds will also help me create a version of the book in Spanish and other languages.</h3>
<p>As a $25 investor, you will receive a signed, 1st edition copy of the book delivered to your doorstep in early 2013. If you invest more, you can receive ...</p>

Introduction
Hello! I’m Jean Ciborowski Fahey, PhD.
        I’m raising money to self-publish a unique book called ...
 
Make Way for Reading - 
a story guide for parents of babies and young children
 
 
This book is in response 
to the alarmingly high number of our children
who are not learning to read !!!
Why do I know this? I know this because for 4 decades I watched more and more children arrive at school unprepared to learn to read, fall behind and rarely catch up.
I taught graduate school at Lesley University and spent 15 years at a Harvard teaching hospital assessing and learning from young children with reading difficulties. Working with Boston Center for Homeless Families, I also saw, close up, how poverty hijacks the reading development of even the brightest of children. 
Parents Make the Difference. Guided by exciting research in early brain development, we now know that when parents learn simple yet fun things to do in their children's first 5 years of life, children arrive at school much better prepared to learn to read and succeed. Thus, I began to deliver early literacy seminars to parents-to-be at a community hospital.

What’s This Unique Book About?
Make Way for Reading brings science and story together in a carefully crafted rhymed picture book. 
It’s about how one little girl gets ready for a lifelong adventure of reading. The story follows Eva from infancy to first grade as she learns to read with the important people in her life (including the family dog!)  
What Does the Book Look Like?
           
As you open the book, the right page tells the story of a child as she learns to read.
On the left page is a message about what children need from us to get ready to learn to read.
Who Is This Book For?
The book is designed to inspire, teach and entertain grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, teachers and any fan of a young child- age birth to five.
But it is especially written for parents ...

Parents-to-be
Busy parents
Immigrant parents
Parents who love to read
Parents who rarely read
Parents who do not read
And because it's in rhyme, it's also a wonderful story to read aloud to a toddler, preschooler and kindergartener on the verge of reading!
Why is This Book Needed?
This book is a wake up call to parents.
More than half of America’s 4th graders are behind in reading, and many of these children never catch up!
During my 15 years assessing hundreds of poor readers, I learned the neuroscience that pointed to this exciting finding:

Face time with parents — especially in a child’s first 5 years — is extremely important for building the neural pathways in the brain for learning to read.

And when parents put down their cell phones or computers and respond with intention (i.e., eye contact, smiles, talking, reading, word play), the young brain forms crucial connections for learning to read.  
Now, encouraged by so many of you, I created a story as a way to educate parents and others about all they can do to get our little ones ready to read and succeed.

The Grand Plan
With your investments, my trusted team and the beautifully illustrated published book in hand,


I will be looking for a socially conscious corporate sponsor to buy the book and pay for subsequent printing costs.


In this way, I will be able to distribute the book free of charge to programs that work with families of young children.


Parent educators and early education teachers may be happy to know my intention to produce a CD of the book (for large group literacy events) and to translate the parent messages into Spanish and other languages.

 
What I’m Looking For and What You Get in Return
I’m raising $15,000 to cover illustration, book design, printing, promotion and shipping costs. Everything you pledge will go toward these costs as well as Indiegogo fees.
Illustration and book design costs              $5,000
Printing (limited 1st edition)                        $3,000
Promotion, legal, tee shirt, shipping costs    $7,000
If I raise additional funds ...
I will create a CD of the book ASAP so parent educators can use it with groups of parents at literacy events; and

Extra funds will also help me create a version of the book in Spanish and other languages.
As a $25 investor, you will receive a signed, 1st edition copy of the book delivered to your doorstep in early 2013. If you invest more, you can receive ...

for the little reader in your life and/or neighborhood both a book and a T-shirt with book art or;

an author event.

<h2>Who Am I And What Is This?</h2>
<p>My name is Donald aka Scott Roche and I am a blogger, podcaster, author, and editor for Flying Island Press. I've been a fan of Westerns all of my life and have always wanted to write one. Thanks to Jared Axelrod, I got an idea for setting and a brace of characters a few years ago and began writing a story. As occasionally happens, I put the story away to let it simmer.  </p>
<p>This year I took it out of the drawer and started working on a novella. After sending it around to some friends, I decided to open up the universe to a select few authors and see what they would do with it. Imagine the gunslingers of the old west with an honor code similar to a samurai’s Bushido, the way of the warrior. These Martials and Rangers, along with the followers of the Clockworker - fabulous tinkerers and healers - are in conflict with an increasingly corrupt justice system lead by the Judges.</p>
<p>The short stories in this anthology will have all of the action and adventure that you’d expect from a Sunday matinee shoot’em up with a dash of philosophy and tension as ancient codes deal with an increasingly modern world. </p>
<p>In addition to my own story, this anthology will contain works by some of my favorite authors. <a href=""http://jakebible.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jake Bible</a>, the mind behind Dead Mech and The Americans<a href=""http://www.justinmacumber.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justin Macumber</a>, author of the military sci fi novel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Haywire-Justin-R-Macumber/dp/1470099152/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Haywire</a>, <a href=""http://madpoetfiles.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zach Ricks</a>, editor of <a href=""http://flyingislandpress.com/flagship"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flagship magazine</a> and author of his own <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Zachary-Ricks/e/B005POG8SO/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weird Western series</a>,<a href=""http://www.jaredaxelrod.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jared Axelrod</a>, creator of the rich world behind <a href=""http://www.tor.com/stories/2012/04/the-battle-of-blood-and-ink-a-fable-of-the-flying-city-excerpt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fables of the Flying City</a> and<a href=""http://www.doccoleman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doc Coleman</a> podcaster and author of the steampunk series Crackle and Bang</p>
<p>Thanks for having a look at this project and share it with all of your friends!</p>
<h2><strong>STRETCH GOAL!!!!</strong></h2>
<p>If we can hit $2750 a story from none other than <a href=""http://www.alasdairstuart.com/?page_id=205"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alasdair Stuart</a> will be added to the anthology. I want this. I want this some kind of bad. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN!!</p>

<span>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</span><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/kickstarter%20basics#Acco"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a>
</h3>
<p> There are several risks and challenges in this project. I have to rely on the artist and authors to supply their works. I then have to take those works and compile them into a book. It's a lot of work. Thankfully my years of work as a self publisher, as well as my work for Flying Island Press have provided me the skills I need. Add to that the fact that I have worked with all of the people associated with this project and have ultimate confidence in their ability to meet deadlines.</p>
<h2><strong>What's the money for?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Each author will be paid a semi professional rate ($.025/word). I have also allotted money for an editor and an artist. IndieGoGo gets a piece, and there are taxes. I also have money earmarked for ""miscellaneous"" which will go towards fulfilling rewards and other expenses.</span></p>

In addition to my own story, this anthology will contain works by some of my favorite authors. Jake Bible, the mind behind Dead Mech and The AmericansJustin Macumber, author of the military sci fi novel Haywire, Zach Ricks, editor of Flagship magazine and author of his own Weird Western series,Jared Axelrod, creator of the rich world behind Fables of the Flying City andDoc Coleman podcaster and author of the steampunk series Crackle and Bang
Thanks for having a look at this project and share it with all of your friends!
STRETCH GOAL!!!!
If we can hit $2750 a story from none other than Alasdair Stuart will be added to the anthology. I want this. I want this some kind of bad. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN!!



RISKS AND CHALLENGES

 There are several risks and challenges in this project. I have to rely on the artist and authors to supply their works. I then have to take those works and compile them into a book. It's a lot of work. Thankfully my years of work as a self publisher, as well as my work for Flying Island Press have provided me the skills I need. Add to that the fact that I have worked with all of the people associated with this project and have ultimate confidence in their ability to meet deadlines.
What's the money for?
Each author will be paid a semi professional rate ($.025/word). I have also allotted money for an editor and an artist. IndieGoGo gets a piece, and there are taxes. I also have money earmarked for ""miscellaneous"" which will go towards fulfilling rewards and other expenses.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Synopsis
Life at the Institute hadn't been so bad for Douglas. Sure he was a mental patient who spent every night waking from a nightmare about the end of the world, finding his hands coated in blood that couldn't be explained. Still the food was edible, the wardens only mildly hostile and he'd managed to make some friends.
 Then there was the attempt on his life and everything changed.
 He discovered he is the last Askardian, one of those who can 'craft' the elements without sponsorship from a higher deity. It didn't help that the new teachers of his flourishing powers happen to be inside his own head, redefining the term sanity. Now he's being sent out into the coastal city of Sol Mavrica where the citizens live with an accepted curse, where a killer stalks the shadows slaying the unwary, where both the local Tribunal forces and a fermenting rebellion seek to recruit him for his powers and to top it all off he has to go to school if he wants to eat, a school buried deep underneath the city where dark things steal wayward students who aren't on time.

“Grandma’s Secret” is the story of an Army brat named Madeline who’s trying to find out her grandma’s secret. When her family is stationed in Germany, Madeline’s search reveals a link to the past that that no one wants to talk about.
The author is a retired teacher, history buff and Army Brat. As a teen, he lived in Germany in the late 70s and then returned to teach on an American Army base some 30 years later. 
The purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to independently publish the book.  Money raised will be used primarily to publish and get the word out. Some contributions will be used for the tools to finish the book. The plan is to run this campaign through June 2012 with a publish copy “off the presses” by August 1st.
The Impact
Even if this campaign doesn't reach its goal, you will still be able to get this book. This campaign is about me finishing this book, and getting a solid first print run out there. 
After the campaign finishes, the book will be released via Amazon, Internet sites and my own site in multiple formats for maximum enjoyment. Full disclosure: Even if the campaign doesn't succeed, everyone who donates will get what they paid for. So this isn't something that can fail. 
See excepts below.
What We Need & What You Get
The contributions will be used for the following:

~$600 for 50 print copies for distribution
~$200 for bookmarks and other advertisement
~$200 for help editing a final version.
~$120 for IndieGoGo Fees
AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS WILL GET COPY OF BOOK. (see perks)
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
This is a social media generated, DIY project – and we need your help to realize its potential. Here’s how you can make a difference:


CONTRIBUTE to our campaign! Any amount appreciated.

SHARE our project with anyone who might be interested – by word of mouth, via email, on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell your enemies. Tell your hairdresser or the cashier when buying groceries.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>From In Power to Empower: Finding Your Unique Leadership Proposition</i> an entrepreneurial approach to leadership, giving readers the tools to see previous versions of their leadership styles as iterations with opportunities for self-improvement. The problem with leadership today is that confidence is being misconstrued with competence; this book explores finding an effective balance between the two.<br/><br/>My name is Afroze Ali and I am the author of <i>From In Power to Empower: Finding Your Unique Leadership Proposition</i>. I wrote this book because I had to shake all of the limitations that others had put on me as a leader and take an entrepreneurial approach to define what kind of leader I wanted to be. I want to share my learnings with other aspiring leaders.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the simple act of questioning whether or not you are competent enough to be a leader is exactly what will make you a good leader. Of course that modesty paired with enough confidence to garner confidence from those you lead would make the ideal combination. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for believing in yourself the way you are in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you embrace mistakes and failures as a part of your success. Mistakes are the beginning of all that is great and are a sign of what is to come from empowering others to do the same.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about good leadership, bad leadership and how to distinguish between the two for yourself, your team or organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lessons learned from an executive at IBM:</strong> Current leaders have wisdom that should be leaned on so we don’t have to reinvent the wheel; at a minimum we can identify the source of the macro-level problems with leadership.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reflections from a Mexican healthcare entrepreneur:</strong> Leadership has different levels of maturity. We all look up to our parents and loved ones who’ve been there and learned that; however, we must redefine how we choose to lead and potentially even reject how our parents led during a different point in time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leaders as Cultural Champions:</strong> A long-time Apple employee in a managerial role shares her feelings about how much culture is impacted when a leader leaves an organization. Culture cannot simply be a policy or interview question; every person in the company is responsible for creating, recreating and maintaining a successful company culture.</li>
<li>
<strong>What are leaders supposed to be doing anyway?</strong> Expert, PhD in Organizational Leadership sums it up nicely through when he shared his first lessons in leadership as a boy scout. Additionally, Afroze’s current manager and VP at SMITH shares how she not only finds the right people to be leaders but how she empowers them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dispelling Myths about Leadership in Tech:</strong> One of my friends and colleagues who is a CTO at an enterprise-level foodservice technology company shares his thoughts and approaches to leadership.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you...</p>
<ul>
<li>are aching to find what makes you unique and marketable, but can’t seem to do enough of the right things to feel successful</li>
<li>are currently in a managerial role but have trouble leading, or wish to move up in your organization</li>
<li>are curious to take an entrepreneurial look at your own leadership style</li>
<li>have often felt yourself to be a misfit when really you never fit in because you were meant to lead</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i>From In Power to Empower</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to professionals early in their careers and experienced professionals who are looking at trying to define what they stand for and find their voice as a leader for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - From In Power to Empower</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 contains the introduction + through Chapter 5.</strong> Afroze starts this book looking at where the idea of leadership started, how it evolved and how it was introduced to the author when she was a child (she tells us when she learned about things like power and lies). Afroze then provides a reflection methodology for individuals to determine their baseline leadership style.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 contains Chapters 6 through 11.</strong> In this part of the book, the author introduces principles of entrepreneurial leadership. These are not principles just for entrepreneurs who want to be leaders; these principles are for anyone who wants to apply entrepreneurial concepts to developing their leadership style. To that end, Afroze shares learnings from her previous experiences, as well as those of others, on how being a leader is not a destination but a journey. Just as a successful business iterates upon itself and its offerings, a successful leader identifies what is working now and iterates upon what needs to be improved in themselves for long term success.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 contains Chapters 12 through 17.</strong> The third part of the book is where the author talks through applications of the entrepreneurial leadership principles learned in previous chapters and applies them to different types of situations, as well as drawing out examples of how it’s all related. For example, when one works on refining their leadership style, such as having a better handle of their emotional skills in a professional work setting, it becomes a natural part of that individual’s baseline leadership style that can be leveraged outside of work as well. If someone is not empowered in one setting, let’s say at the workplace, it impacts how that person feels about themselves elsewhere and vice versa.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Afroze Ali is a Strategy Director at SMITH, an e-commerce consultancy. There, she advises large companies on how to understand their internal and external humans before building out large platforms that impact the entire organization.<br/><br/>Afroze managed to convince herself for years, using a number of excuses, that she was not yet ready to be a leader. After doing an inventory of herself and her experience, she realized that she had been a leader all along, simply because of the way she approached situations and her desire to solve problems. There was no way she wasn’t going to share her learnings with others.<br/><br/>Afroze often felt disenfranchised in various settings, almost like the system was rigged against her. Chances were that in some cases, that might have been the case. She got so used to feeling that way that she could not see past arbitrary limitations that someone, somewhere had dreamt up for her (maybe a parent, a teacher or something in the media). She had to re-adjust her worldview and re-envision what she focused on: opportunities instead of limitations. <strong>This book is her liberation story.</strong><br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Afroze at Email: AfrozeTheAuthor@gmail.com <br/>LinkedIn: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/afrozeali"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/afrozeali</a><br/>Instagram: @spectacledmemsaab<br/>Twitter: @ideallyafroze</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Necessary Symbiosis: What Happens When Science and Government Work Together (and When They Don't) </i></p>
<p>My book explores the intersection of science and government, especially how that relationship has evolved over the years and the consequences of that relationship. What happens when that relationship is good, like the scale up of penicillin production? And what happens when that relationship is bad, like politicians bolstering anti-vaccine propaganda?<br/><br/>My name is Vyshnavi Karra and I am the author of <i>Necessary Symbiosis</i>. I wrote this book because as a scientist, I felt like putting facts out into the universe was no longer enough. In the age of the Internet, anyone can Google anything or write anything that can be Googled, which means scientists like myself need to become more involved in advocating their work rather than letting other people spin the facts however they want. You can see how important it is for scientists to engage the public with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, anti-vaccine movement, data privacy, etc.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a means to weaponize science and scientific data in a way that combats fake news, for the greater good. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for science advocacy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become more involved in science advocacy. Because if we don’t advocate our work as the experts in our niches, someone else will, and they may spin it for their own personal gain.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Government and Science Miscommunication and How to Weaponize Science for Good, including topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the US government botched its COVID-19 response in the very beginning, making the fight even harder.</li>
<li>How much potential personalized healthcare has for improving health standards.</li>
<li>How my friend, Dr. Tess, learned how to communicate science more effectively by talking to an anti-vaxxer.</li>

Interview with News@Northeastern
WISE Young Professional Board posts on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram
Why I believe the US botched its early COVID-19 response
What I would say to potential readers that may have some anti-science views
Short Summary
Necessary Symbiosis: What Happens When Science and Government Work Together (and When They Don't) 
My book explores the intersection of science and government, especially how that relationship has evolved over the years and the consequences of that relationship. What happens when that relationship is good, like the scale up of penicillin production? And what happens when that relationship is bad, like politicians bolstering anti-vaccine propaganda?My name is Vyshnavi Karra and I am the author of Necessary Symbiosis. I wrote this book because as a scientist, I felt like putting facts out into the universe was no longer enough. In the age of the Internet, anyone can Google anything or write anything that can be Googled, which means scientists like myself need to become more involved in advocating their work rather than letting other people spin the facts however they want. You can see how important it is for scientists to engage the public with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, anti-vaccine movement, data privacy, etc.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a means to weaponize science and scientific data in a way that combats fake news, for the greater good. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for science advocacy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become more involved in science advocacy. Because if we don’t advocate our work as the experts in our niches, someone else will, and they may spin it for their own personal gain.In this book, you'll learn about Government and Science Miscommunication and How to Weaponize Science for Good, including topics such as:

How the US government botched its COVID-19 response in the very beginning, making the fight even harder.
How much potential personalized healthcare has for improving health standards.
How my friend, Dr. Tess, learned how to communicate science more effectively by talking to an anti-vaxxer.

You will love this book if you’re interested in just how close the relationship between science and government has been in the past and why that relationship is so key to the progress of society. You will also enjoy this book if you’re a scientist and you’re still hesitant about becoming your own advocate but are curious about what that could look like.Necessary Symbiosis is a non-fiction book that speaks to scientists and science advocates who are looking at policy, science, and how they interact with one another for the first time.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Holistic Success: Mind, Body, Soul &amp; Business is about the collapse of the American Dream and how it has become unachievable for most of us.<br/><br/>My name is Paige Hunt and I am the author of Holistic Success: Mind, Body, Soul &amp; Business. I wrote this book because I have realized that the current state of success in the U.S. breeds misery. We set unrealistic standards of success with limited paths for achievement. As a population, we are not happy and we do not feel successful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 20% of U.S. citizens feel they are living the full American Dream</li>
<li>Less than 50% of U.S. citizens believe they are living any part of the American Dream</li>
<li>Only 14% of U.S. adults feel like they are “very happy”</li>
<li>Less than 50% of Americans believe that when their children reach their age, their standard of living will be better.</li>
</ul>
<p>The American Dream is specific, narrow and constricting. Our new dream, the Holistic Dream, must have space for mistakes, route changes, meaningful relationships and balance.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to find your personal definition of success, I also hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for developing a well-balanced, happy lifestyle. Ultimately, I want you to see Holistic Success: Mind, Body, Soul &amp; Business as a tool to help you realize a new dream, the Holistic Dream, with goals that allow us to focus on and balance success in all areas of our lives.<br/><br/>Holistic Success is a nonfiction book that speaks to students/early career individuals and established professionals alike who want to look at success and happiness in a new way.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about The Holistic Dream and the core principles that contribute to achieving holistic success. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Whitney Wolf's innovative founding of Bumble, the prolific connection and dating app</li>
<li>Rob Dyrdek’s, host of MTV’s Ridiculousness and Fantasy Factory, early career successes and failures, and</li>
<li>Brene Brown’s struggle with vulnerability</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you if you are someone who society’s current definition of success doesn’t fit and likes to challenge the status quo, or if you need to renew or find happiness in your day to day life, find your path or make a career switch.</p>
<h3>The Book - Holistic Success: Mind, Body, Soul and Business</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. These chapters focus on where the American Dream failed us by explaining the history and outcomes of our national ethos. We will then dive into where to go from here in the context of the Holistic Dream.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-9 and discusses the principles of Holistic Success. These principles include vulnerability, passion, collaboration, balance and more, and will include anecdotes from my life and personal mentors as well as insights from individuals like Tony Robbins and Kevin Hart.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapter 10 + conclusion. In these chapters we will discuss what the society will look like if we implement the Holistic Dream.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>This book is a compilation of intriguing and impactful personal stories from various people that cover the events in their lives that shaped their identity and the truth of how God reshaped the way they defined themselves.<br/><br/>This book is inspired by personal experiences and struggles that have given me a heart for the way my own generation views themselves and the Christian lifestyle. My book will publish February of 2020.<br/> <h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/>Listening to the List focuses on the titles that define one’s life and their impact on the way one views themselves and the way they live day-to-day. Throughout the stories there is an impactful comparison between the titles we give ourselves, and the reality of the identity Christ would give us instead.<br/><br/>My name is Alexa Holsten and I am the author of Listening to the List. I wrote this book because of the crucial need for my generation to understand the topic of true identity and the impact it makes in one’s life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how your view of identity affects your relationship with yourself, others, and God, and how changing this view can change your life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for finding confidence in Christ and who He calls us to be in the midst of our struggles and experiences. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better love the people around you and help them see themselves as they were created to be.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the flawed way you view yourself and the life changing truth about how God sees you. You'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to embrace hard times as an opportunity to shape your character</li>
<li>How the people around you can positively or negatively impact the person you will become</li>
<li>How choosing to cling to truth over self-given titles will alter your interaction with the world around you</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you have questions about how God will use your stories and experiences to open your eyes to the unique identity He has given you. Living by the List is a non-fiction book that speaks to high school and college girls and those around them who are looking at understanding the contrast between the titles given by the world and titles given by God.<br/><br/>This book contains 14 chapters that focus on a variety of conflicting identifiers such as Abandoned vs Chosen, Apathetic vs Obedient, and Broken vs Redeemed.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

</div></div>","OverviewThis book is a compilation of intriguing and impactful personal stories from various people that cover the events in their lives that shaped their identity and the truth of how God reshaped the way they defined themselves.This book is inspired by personal experiences and struggles that have given me a heart for the way my own generation views themselves and the Christian lifestyle. My book will publish February of 2020. Story of My Book
Listening to the List focuses on the titles that define one’s life and their impact on the way one views themselves and the way they live day-to-day. Throughout the stories there is an impactful comparison between the titles we give ourselves, and the reality of the identity Christ would give us instead.My name is Alexa Holsten and I am the author of Listening to the List. I wrote this book because of the crucial need for my generation to understand the topic of true identity and the impact it makes in one’s life.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how your view of identity affects your relationship with yourself, others, and God, and how changing this view can change your life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for finding confidence in Christ and who He calls us to be in the midst of our struggles and experiences. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better love the people around you and help them see themselves as they were created to be.In this book, you'll learn about the flawed way you view yourself and the life changing truth about how God sees you. You'll learn:

How to embrace hard times as an opportunity to shape your character
How the people around you can positively or negatively impact the person you will become
How choosing to cling to truth over self-given titles will alter your interaction with the world around you
 You will love this book if you have questions about how God will use your stories and experiences to open your eyes to the unique identity He has given you. Living by the List is a non-fiction book that speaks to high school and college girls and those around them who are looking at understanding the contrast between the titles given by the world and titles given by God.This book contains 14 chapters that focus on a variety of conflicting identifiers such as Abandoned vs Chosen, Apathetic vs Obedient, and Broken vs Redeemed. What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: 
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February 2020.
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.

When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now. When I publish, you will receive:

A personally signed copy of my book
A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)
Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book
And more...

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>I love cooking and experimenting with new recipes, and for years I was paid to teach cooking classes and develop new recipes every day. But during my classes I found that most students didn't want to spend the time to learn a dozen new recipes or browse endlessly on food blogs. Rather, most students wanted simple tweaks to improve what they are already cooking. They wanted small ways to expand their cooking repertoire, and simple recipes to boost the flavor of their daily meals. And so I made a cookbook of sauces (and a few other basics)! </p>
<p>Many of us– including me– cook the same recipes week after week, relying on just a few basic meals to get us through our busy lives. Realizing that something as simple as a sauce can improve even the most basic of our meals, this book was born with support from my incredible boyfriend and excellent collegue Becky Striepe. <i>Gettin' Saucy </i>has captured all this sauce magic you need to make your kitchen a little sassier... and saucer!  </p>
<p>This short collection of deliciously nourishing sauce and staple recipes will make even the simple foods taste better, with minimal effort. </p>

<p><strong>In <i>Gettin' Saucy</i>, you will get: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>10 vinaigrette and marinade recipes for zestier salads, sassier roasted veggies, and perfect marinated tofu and tempeh</li>
<li>4 creamy dressings to make satisfying salads, noodles, and dips</li>
<li>5 basic sauces with healthier twists, like a date-sweetened barbecue sauce and a pesto made with sunflower and sesame </li>
<li>4 creamy vegan sauces and gravies for yummy noodles or mashed potatoes</li>
<li>4 sweet sauces to dress up your oatmeal, fruit, or ice cream sundaes</li>
<li>11 plant-based basics that help create a more complete foundation for a more plant-based kitchen.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is my first cookbook, and I'm looking for funding just to cover the basics of the first printing and gather pre-orders! Assuming the funding is met, we'll have these books ready just in time for the holidays, so you can give the gift of sauciness this year. </p>
<p>Funding will be used to cover the following:</p>

Got Here and What’s next”. This book is more pertinent to you and your life
today than ever before. I would like to ask for 5 minutes of your time to show

published, and just how much you will be missing out on if you do not buy a
copy of it today. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I promise you this: you have never heard
this story before. This is, finally, the complete narrative of money and the
economy which have been made out to look so mysterious for so long. After
reading this book, you will not only have a much better understanding of  current events,  but you will see fundamental topics like the
rise of China, the cost of higher education, the struggle of the middle class , and America’s 59 Trillion dollar debt in a completely new light. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We live in a world of short news cycles
and we tend to think and react like “day-traders”. Historical events, however,
work on a very different timeframe. Without a holistic and integrated
perspective of the path leading to our current situation, you can never truly
understand where we are today and where we are headed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">By reading this book, you will
understand how we got to the economic situation we are in today. In the process,
you will learn many eye-opening facts including how one Friday afternoon
meeting in Camp David unintentionally created the world we live in, why we were
so strongly blindsided by the 2008 crisis, how the Union was able to fund the
civil war and why it matters today, how a meaningless stock manipulation ploy created
the most powerful financial institution in the history of the world, and what
money is really made to do. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You will also learn of jaw-dropping realities
such as why it cost 20 times more to retrofit the San Francisco Bay Bridge than
it did to build it 80 years ago, why compensation on Wall Street grew by 15
times in the past three decades while those on Main Street hardly grew with
cost of living, and why the frightening yet euphoric boom and bust cycles are a
norm.  These and many more “whys” will
become clearer as you become more knowledgeable, eloquent, and informed about
the state of our world and the fascinating history of money and finance.</p>

Esta campaña es para fundar el primer tomo de una novela en la que he estado trabajando durante más de once años. Comencé a escribir el primer tomo de ""El grupo Domak"" en agosto del 2003 y terminé de escribir el cuarto y último tomo en diciembre del 2010, desde entonces he estado dedicándome a pulir mi escritura, para volverlo un trabajo de calidad. No me canso de leer y repasar esta historia que tanto me gusta, espero poder compartirla y llevarla al papel con la ayuda de todos ustedes.
Con su colaboración voy a poder mandar a imprimir una primera edición (500 ejemplares) de “El grupo Domak: Los siete puntos”, que es la primera parte de la saga de cuatro libros. También espero que eso sirva de puntapié inicial para luego continuar editando e imprimiendo los siguientes tres tomos, hasta llegar a compartir esta historia hasta el final.La primer meta es imprimir 500 ejemplares en tapa rústica. El total recaudado irá destinado a saldar el precio de imprenta, los costos de las recompensas, el packaging, los envíos y la comisión que cobra Indiegogo. Si alcanzamos esa meta, aspiraremos a la siguiente, y se revelarán metas mayores.Si no cuentas con tarjeta de crédito, o cuenta de paypal, pero aún así quieres adquirir alguna de las recompensas, comunícate conmigo a la siguiente dirección de email y veremos qué hacer: elgrupodomak@gmail.comSiempre puedes cambiar el monto de tu contribución a uno más alto.

Jedna su od najuspješnijih i najvećih kompanija za mobilni gaming na svijetu, a tijekom kampanje će svakako biti još prilika da diskretno spomenemo njihove uspjehe i dostignuća... </p><p>Kampanja se odsad službeno zove Big Blue Bubble - El Comandante.

Jedna od najstarijih informatičkih udruga u HR, okuplja korisnike Oraclea.

HROUG okuplja korisnike Oraclea u Hrvatskoj, kako bi im pomogao u zajedničkim problemima, edukaciji, po potrebi zajedničkom nastupu prema samom Oracleu (kao svojevrsni sindikat LOL, samo en uposlenika nego korisnika), a HROUG konferencije i druženja imaju legendaran status na IT sceni.</p><p>Drugi je <a href=""https://www.manpower.hr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Manpower Group</a>, multinacionalna tvrtka sa sjedištem u Milwaukeeju, SAD.

Kao najveća i najinovativnija globalna tvrtka u svojoj industriji, ManpowerGroup s više od 30.000 zaposlenih u 3.000 ureda i 80 zemalja i teritorija, godišnje provodi 12 milijuna intervjua u potrazi za najboljim talentima. Zaposlenici s odgovarajućim vještinama i iskustvom su postali najoskudniji resurs.

Osnovni im je cilj osiguranje optimalne informatičke infrastrukture, procesa i procedura za razmjenu elektroničkih dokumenata kako bi svojim korisnicima pružili uslugu koja će njihovo poslovanje učiniti još konkurentnijim.

Računam dosta pisati i u pripremnoj fazi, tema je zaista zanimljiva i ima materijala. Naravno, i sa samog lica mjesta ću stavljati fotke, putopisne crtice i slično. S prošle dvije ekspedicije (Pamir i Mustang) bilo je na svakoj po ukupno preko 200 fotki i 110.000 znakova teksta – dakle teksta za omanji roman!</p><p>Ovo s putopisom mislim riješiti vrlo jednostavno. Tko uplati 16 dolara, jednostavno ću ga dodati u posebnu zatvorenu grupu na Facebooku za ovaj projekt, i postove za one koji su pomogli kampanju učiniti vidljivima grupi ""pomagača"" da ih oni gledaju i da im osvježe dan, a drugi ne vide. Putopis i fotke neće biti Public!</p><p>Nije neka sigurnost s pet ključeva PGP-a, OIB-om i identifikacijom mrežnice, nego jednostavno, fleksibilno i za korisnika potpuno bezbolno. Kad uplatiš 16 dolara za putopis na Fejsu, više NE TREBAŠ URADITI NIŠTA, samo budi na Fejsu, imam tvoje ime i ideš na distro listu za odgovarajuće Fejs postove vezane s putopisom i to je to. Ne može lakše.</p><p>Sjedit ćeš sredinom kolovoza na Jadranu i dignuti Fejs ""ajd baš da vidim šta ima"" a tamo – neka budala gladan i smrznut u nekim vrletima. LOL! I još mora fotkati jer je obećao u kampanji. Nasmiješ se idiotu i nastaviš pržiti na suncu, pijuć koktel i gledajuć komade.</p><p>Ovaj model isti je kao za lanjsku ekspediciju na Mustang i preklanjsku na Pamir i funkcionirao je odlično.</p><p><strong>50 doloresa – Fotopis F+</strong></p><p>Isto kao fotopis, samo za one koji mogu i žele pomoći malo više! Prvi put sam u ovom rangu nudio Fotopis + pivo, ali onda se desilo sljedeće – nakon povratka kad sam ponudio ljudima da se nađemo i ""odradimo"" dogovoreno pivo koje im pripada, svi su u nekoj gužvi, ovo, ono, a ja sam zapravo sve s terena ispričao, i fotke stavio, već u putopisu. Tako da je to s pivom ispalo malo promašeno.</p><p>U svakom slučaju – budući da je 16 dolara zbilja sitna lova, tko želi pomoći s 50 – samo naprijed, cijenim to, ekspedicija ima velike troškove.... a što se piva tiče, lako se dogovorimo.</p><p><strong>199 doloresa – Big Picture</strong></p><p>Lovatori i oni koji vole umjetnost – ne znam kako će se pogledati u ogledalo ako ne uzmu ovaj jaki perk od 199 dolara... uspješni startupi, njihovi pokretači, investitori, vlasnici iPhonea, kapitalisti, neoliberali, paleoanarhisti, ljubitelji Tesli, mrzitelji Tesli, poduzetnici, saborski zastupnici, socijalisti, kriminalci.... a svih njih ima među mojim frendovima....

Damir je otišao iz Hrvatske pred... dosta godina... i u Kanadi osnovao Big Blue Bubble, kompaniju koja se bavi razvojem igara, primarno za mobilne platforme. Jedna su od najuspješnijih i najvećih kompanija za mobilni gaming na svijetu, a tijekom kampanje će svakako biti još prilika da diskretno spomenemo njihove uspjehe i dostignuća... Kampanja se odsad službeno zove Big Blue Bubble - El Comandante. Dvjesto godina nesreće smo odbacili jer ne zvuči baš ""sponzorski"" LOL, ali spika o nevoljama Bolivije i Paragvaja ostaje, priča nema uljepšavanja....Iako je glavni cilj ispunjen, svaki prilog je dobrodošao i bit će popraćen obilnom zahvalnošću, jer ekspedicija ovakvog tipa ima prilične troškove....Wikipedia entry za Big Blue Bubble:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Blue_BubbleUz glavnog sponzora Big Blue Bubble, koji je već predstavljen, kampanja El Comandante ima još tri veća dobrotvora, u paketu imena na koje sam posebno ponosan - Neoliberal Bastard! Haha, paket Neoliberal Bastard. Hvala im! Hvala svima koji su podržali projekt, ma kojim iznosom!Ukratko, predstavljanje tri Neoliberal Bastarda....Prvi je (abecedno) HROUG, kultna te legendarna Hrvatska udruga Oracle korisnika. Jedna od najstarijih informatičkih udruga u HR, okuplja korisnike Oraclea. Ako ste u IT-u, znate što je Oracle, ako niste - ni ne uznemiravajte se previše.... neka baza podataka, na kojoj se vjerojatno čuva.... pa više manje sve što itko zna o vama, negdje, a i mnogo više od toga. HROUG okuplja korisnike Oraclea u Hrvatskoj, kako bi im pomogao u zajedničkim problemima, edukaciji, po potrebi zajedničkom nastupu prema samom Oracleu (kao svojevrsni sindikat LOL, samo en uposlenika nego korisnika), a HROUG konferencije i druženja imaju legendaran status na IT sceni.Drugi je Manpower Group, multinacionalna tvrtka sa sjedištem u Milwaukeeju, SAD. Gotovo 70 godina, ManpowerGroup tvrtkama diljem svijeta pruža sveobuhvatna rješenja na području zapošljavanja i razvoja ljudskih potencijala. Kao najveća i najinovativnija globalna tvrtka u svojoj industriji, ManpowerGroup s više od 30.000 zaposlenih u 3.000 ureda i 80 zemalja i teritorija, godišnje provodi 12 milijuna intervjua u potrazi za najboljim talentima. Zaposlenici s odgovarajućim vještinama i iskustvom su postali najoskudniji resurs. Nude sve usluge iz područja ljudskih resursa, od regrutacije i pred selekcije do testiranja i intervjua do skraćivanja vremena zapošljavanja i vaših troškova.Treći (abecedno) je Omnizon Networks, dosad poznat kao Redok. Rebranding u Omnizon Networks je bitan element sudjelovanja u ovom projektu, pa ga zato naglašavamo. Omnizon (ex Redok) je na sceni od svibnja 2009. godine, a pozicionirali su se kao informacijski posrednik u procesu razmjene elektroničkih dokumenata, izrade porezno priznatog elektroničkog računa (eRačun) i arhive elektroničkih dokumenata u B2B i B2G okruženju. Osnovni im je cilj osiguranje optimalne informatičke infrastrukture, procesa i procedura za razmjenu elektroničkih dokumenata kako bi svojim korisnicima pružili uslugu koja će njihovo poslovanje učiniti još konkurentnijim. Bitan čimbenik predstavlja Megatrend grupacija sa svojim ljudskim resursima koji im kontinuirano stoje na raspolaganju.Bit će još prilike za upoznavanje s darežljivcima, a sad, još malo i okrećemo se putopisanju, op op!*********""Everybody gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for all my sins they gave me one.""There is a summary in English at the very bottom of this page. Pozadinska glazba u videu je ""Bolivia"" iz soundtracka za legendarni film Scarface, autor je Giorgio Moroder i nadam se da me neće tužiti za ovu malu posudbicu. Ta stvar svira kad Tony ide na dogovore kod Sose u –  naravno, Boliviju.Kad se spomene Južna Amerika, na što prvo pomislite? Brazil, samba, nogomet, Argentina, Messi, džungle Amazone, Buenos Aires, tango, možda na Čile, eventualno Kolumbiju…. Već malo teže na Venecuelu, još teže na Peru i Ekvador…. A dvije zemlje koje su vjerojatno pri dnu asocijacija prosječnog razmišljatelja o Južnoj Americi su – Bolivija i Paragvaj…. Posebno Paragvaj, o kojem većina Hrvata ne bi znala reći ni dvije rečenice.Ove dvije zemlje proglasio sam najnesretnijima na cijelom kontinentu, i u naslov stavio parafrazu romana Gabriela Garcie Marqueza, pisca koji vjerojatno najbolje utjelovljuje duh južnoameričke melankolije.Sto godina samoće, dvjesto godina nesreće.Obzirom na moje malo ""pomaknute"" putopisne interese, Bolivija i Paragvaj su mi najzanimljivije zemlje kontinenta. Možda niste znali da, iako su bez izlaza na more, obje zemlje imaju mornaricu i zbog povijesnih razloga jako drže do nje. Obje imaju i hrvatsku dijasporu, i to dijasporu s vrlo zanimljivim sudbinama i poviješću. Imaju i još dosta toga zajedničkog i različitog, ali na to ćemo doći na vrijeme…Dakle plan je otići u Boliviju i Paragvaj, vrludati uzduž i poprijeko – malo džipom, malo pješke, a malo klatareći se na magarcu – prepričati najzanimljivija opažanja i ispucati hrpu fotografija.Primijetit ćete da su dijelovi teksta koji nisu specifično vezani za Dvjesto godina... slični kao i za lanjsku, vrlo uspješnu kampanju za himalajsku provinciju Mustang, i preklanjsku na Pamirski trakt, jer osnovna ideja je ista – otići negdje, u neku rupu svijeta za koju je malo tko čuo, i složiti putopis bogat jakim fotografijama (to zovem ""fotopis"").HAJLAJTS (GLAVNE TOČKE) OVOGODIŠNJEG PROJEKTA!- Mjesta hrvatskih iseljenika u BOL i PAR- Lokacija pogibije Che Guevare (wow, braćo s ljevice vadite kartice, ako ih imate LOL)- Bolivijski Altiplano- El Chaco- Paragvajski Amiši- Prvo komunističko selo na svijetu- Nacisti u Paragvaju?- Jezuitske misije iz 17. stoljećaZnači – SVE.... revolucionari, nacisti, misionari, religijski fanatici, masoni, komunjare, vile i ajduci.... fale još samo alieni, ali ako se posreći.... Desno je moj travel partner Francois, genijalan lik, poznat je čitateljima prošle dvije kampanje, doduše nisam siguran da će mi se pridružiti na Dvjesto godina nesreće. Nosimo kirgiske kape.Što ljudi kažu?Ne znam jeste li pratili lanjsku kampanju u Mustang i preklanjsku na Pamir, organizirane po sličnim principima. Čitateljima su se vrlo svidjele. Ovdje je samo kraći pregled njihovih komentara, bez navođenja imena:Kao i uvijek - big support! Fasciniras determinacijom.Inače zanimljivo nam pišeš, hoćemo još. Ja to naglas čitam ukućanima. Kao dokumentaracDa je jednostavno ne bi bilo zanimljivo. Ovako možda ispadne i kakav epski deseterac od svega toga, koji će se prenositi s koljena na koljeno, uz gusle i to...jel nosis kakvo hladno oruzje sa sobom?Wow, koja fotkaInače, predobra je slika, pogled vam je super iz ovog loungeaYebote koja vukoyebina! a opet guštam uz pićence na terasi u ovu ljetnu noć čitat vaše pričeLuđaja!Sjajna fotka.

I sjajni opisi - kao da smo tamo.S nestrpljenjem čekamo nastavakBas gustam u fotkama...Ovo nije putopis, ovo je vremeplov!Oleg ne bih te htio (naročito tebe) previše hvaliti da se ne umisliš, ali ova serija tekstova ti je jebeno dobra. Keep it up.Tu kaj god uslikas sve izgleda fenomenalno!Planine kao da su barsunom presvucene, super izgledaPa ovo postaje edukativni serijal Lijepo sam ovo pročitao i svašta naučioDjeluje kao pejsaž u World of Tanks...

Kao da citam neki novi scenarij brace Coen u stilu new western-afotka je..nadrealna!k'o pravi Dalmatinac, sve bolji što ti je lošije.Meni je ova fotka moto monumentna!stvarno pratim s nevjerovatnim isčekivanjima tvoj svaki post. Valjda kao nekad izvještaje o Neil Armstrongu. Dojam nestvarnosti je, pretpostavljam, vrlo sličan. Tako dalek od naše svakodnevnice i vlastitih iskustavaPlease take my money (citaj: hocu iducu kampanju)Olegže meni je to bio super putopis!Svaka čast, svake lipe je vrijediloJedva čekam novu kampanjuFala Oleg, bilo je fakat odlično! Nadam se nekom novom putopisu u budućnostiDakle Hrvatska do Pamira... Tko je sudjelovao i pratio, obogatio se fantastičnim fotkama i saznanjima i osjeća se, zacijelo, kao i ja nevjerojatno privilegiran.OK SKEPTICI JESAM LI VAS UVJERIO??!!Kad se ide?Plan je kolovoz 2017.Zašto biste trebali podržati ovu kampanju?Zato što ti osobno koji ovo čitaš nećeš nikad u životu otići tamo. Ne zanima te, ne da ti se, daleko je.... IPAK, imaš priliku sudjelovati u odlasku u zemlje nesreće – preko ove kampanje! Neka atom tebe ipak ide tamo, atom zvan dolar, kuna, dojčmarka. Gledat ćeš fotke, postove odande i pomisiliti ""i djelić mene je sad tamo u toj pripizdini"".Ako spadaš u 1% onih koji planiraju ići, ali negdje u budućnosti, onda se opet isplati sudjelovati u kampanji jer čitat ćeš putopisne opaske pa ćeš na temelju njih bolje isplanirati svoj vlastiti put i imat ćeš kvalitetnu fotku da te podsjeća na nešto gdje si i sam bio, tj bit ćeš jednom kada i ako odeš tamo.Što se dobije zauzvrat, šta ima od perkova?Ovo je jednostavna kampanja i nema puno perkova.16 doloresa – FotopisZa 16 dolara (popust u odnosu na Pamir preklani) dobiješ putopis, sve postove i fotke koje ću stavljati kao pripremu i sa samog putovanja. Računam dosta pisati i u pripremnoj fazi, tema je zaista zanimljiva i ima materijala. Naravno, i sa samog lica mjesta ću stavljati fotke, putopisne crtice i slično. S prošle dvije ekspedicije (Pamir i Mustang) bilo je na svakoj po ukupno preko 200 fotki i 110.000 znakova teksta – dakle teksta za omanji roman!Ovo s putopisom mislim riješiti vrlo jednostavno. Tko uplati 16 dolara, jednostavno ću ga dodati u posebnu zatvorenu grupu na Facebooku za ovaj projekt, i postove za one koji su pomogli kampanju učiniti vidljivima grupi ""pomagača"" da ih oni gledaju i da im osvježe dan, a drugi ne vide. Putopis i fotke neće biti Public!Nije neka sigurnost s pet ključeva PGP-a, OIB-om i identifikacijom mrežnice, nego jednostavno, fleksibilno i za korisnika potpuno bezbolno. Kad uplatiš 16 dolara za putopis na Fejsu, više NE TREBAŠ URADITI NIŠTA, samo budi na Fejsu, imam tvoje ime i ideš na distro listu za odgovarajuće Fejs postove vezane s putopisom i to je to. Ne može lakše.Sjedit ćeš sredinom kolovoza na Jadranu i dignuti Fejs ""ajd baš da vidim šta ima"" a tamo – neka budala gladan i smrznut u nekim vrletima. LOL! I još mora fotkati jer je obećao u kampanji. Nasmiješ se idiotu i nastaviš pržiti na suncu, pijuć koktel i gledajuć komade.Ovaj model isti je kao za lanjsku ekspediciju na Mustang i preklanjsku na Pamir i funkcionirao je odlično.50 doloresa – Fotopis F+Isto kao fotopis, samo za one koji mogu i žele pomoći malo više! Prvi put sam u ovom rangu nudio Fotopis + pivo, ali onda se desilo sljedeće – nakon povratka kad sam ponudio ljudima da se nađemo i ""odradimo"" dogovoreno pivo koje im pripada, svi su u nekoj gužvi, ovo, ono, a ja sam zapravo sve s terena ispričao, i fotke stavio, već u putopisu. Tako da je to s pivom ispalo malo promašeno.U svakom slučaju – budući da je 16 dolara zbilja sitna lova, tko želi pomoći s 50 – samo naprijed, cijenim to, ekspedicija ima velike troškove.... a što se piva tiče, lako se dogovorimo.199 doloresa – Big PictureLovatori i oni koji vole umjetnost – ne znam kako će se pogledati u ogledalo ako ne uzmu ovaj jaki perk od 199 dolara... uspješni startupi, njihovi pokretači, investitori, vlasnici iPhonea, kapitalisti, neoliberali, paleoanarhisti, ljubitelji Tesli, mrzitelji Tesli, poduzetnici, saborski zastupnici, socijalisti, kriminalci.... a svih njih ima među mojim frendovima.... KGB ZNA da ovo čitate.... hehe....U sklopu tog perka dobije se divna slika za staviti na zid – poput ovih koje vidite na fotografijama iznad i ispod ovog pasusa.Slike s fotografija dio su mog projekta Without People – nisu s Pamira niti iz Mustanga, već samo ilustracija kako slika ovog formata, koja je dio perka, izgleda. Ovo doli je surovi neoliberal Nikša i njegova slika za Without People u gepeku.Kliknite gore na tab Gallery, tamo je par primjera mojih fotografija, koje NISU iz Bolivije i Paragvaja – logično, jer tamo tek trebam otići – ali koje vam daju neku ideju kakav krajolik očekujem i kakav tip fotografija planiram napraviti. Ovo su inače moje fotografije iz Pamira, Armenije, Nepala, Kazahstana, Tajlanda, Irske, Turske, Kalifornije i Nevade (SAD), s lokacija donekle sličnih onima kakve očekujem, samo da vam da neku ideju.Zapravo je interesantno kako su fizionomije ljudi iz Nepala i s Pamira slične onima koje očekujem na nekim mjestima i u Južnoj Americi! Mogle bi proći kao autentične...449 doloresa – Neoliberal BastardOvo je corporate package – imaš firmu, aute, robote, virtualne điđe, datacentre, softvere, ekstraprofite, saprofite? ...aj ne škrtari, pokaži da si baja! S ovim perkom ću na lokaciju uzeti i vaše predmete, majice, proizvode, i napraviti par reklamnih slika na licu mjesta, podijeliti domorocima ili nešto slično. Paket uključuje naravno praćenje same kampanje (za koliko god ljudi unutar firme želite), sliku velikog formata za na zid i po želji reklamiranje proizvoda/kompanije na licu mjesta.Ovo je legenda Puskar, u Mustangu na Himalaji, s majicom slovenskog web shopa enaA.com, glavnog sponzora lanjske kampanje. Ovo je profesor Tursunbay, u selu Aličur na Pamiru, s brendiranom busolom Marco Polo.1199 doloresa – El Comandante!Ovaj je perk dostupan samo jedan. Uključuje mogućnost imenovanja cijele ekspedicije po vašoj tvrtci, promo fotke s logićima firme uz put, zastave, majice, slikanje kraj Cheovog zadnjeg položaja u majici s korporativnim logom (e ako ovo nije fora...) plus sve u ovom prethodnom perku (slika za na zid, putopis itd).*************************Što s lovom ako ne odem?Imam namjeru otići u ove zemlje kad-tad, dakle jedini realni problem koji se može dogoditi jest odgoda puta zbog nečega, nemam pojma čega.

The characters encounter one another, as well as authority figures and ghosts, at home and through institutions: school, court cells, a detention centre, and a group home, dreaming of magic and escape.</p><p>Indigo is a 13-year old goth and teenage criminal with a history of antisocial tendencies, shoplifting, destructive impulses, cutting, and dysmorphia/dysphoria. When they start bleeding petals and flames along with their blood, they make connections between alienation, magic, and survival.</p><p>Grey is Indigo’s best friend, a shy trans girl with stolen Sharpies and heavy sketchbooks whose illustrations come to life and make spells come true.</p><p>Both are the only children of poor, depressed, single moms in a small, mostly-white town in Southern Ontario. In 1999, their favourite movie is <i>The Craft</i>, their favourite band is Marilyn Manson, and their favourite activity is spell-casting. When they find a book about witchcraft hidden among a series of letters written to and from their mothers, who claim not to know each other and refuse to speak – one is mostly-absent, the other is obsessed with a talk show hosted by a psychic and Saturday night episodes of <i>Cops</i> – they choose to communicate with ghosts, and each other, instead.</p><p>As the two are separated, and Indigo is charged with crimes they barely remember committing, each of them continue casting spells – or trying to – in dangerous and painful attempts to stay alive. Shuffled through the juvenile injustice system, Indigo encounters Sea, a clumsy and curious social worker who hates her job and feels complicit in the pain of teenagers, and Mint, a 16-year old Black girl with a stick-and-poke tattoo of moon phases on her wrist, rage of her own about isolation and incarceration, and a longer sentence for a non-violent crime.</p><p>Each of them wants to be believed, to be real, and to create their own form of justice.</p><h3>♥ About the Author ♥</h3><h2>♥ Maranda Elizabeth ♥</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500745293/irhksodxh97uzpno5xd6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I spent my babyhood years living in a haunted house in a rural area, where I developed psychic connections with my twin, and with the ghosts in our home. In early childhood, my mom, twin, &amp; I moved to a small town on Ojibway/Chippewa and Anishinabek land, also known as Lindsay, Ontario. As a misfit goth teenager who grew up watching 18+ shows on Showcase TV with the volume turned low, I was told by grown-ups that when I escape my small town, I need to find a way to live on Queen West, where the weirdos are. And now I do! I do my writing and magic-making from my bachelorex apartment on the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee and the Métis, also known as the city of Toronto (from the Haudenosaunee word Tkaronto), Ontario.

Being arrested, charged, and incarcerated multiple times in my early-teens contributed to my later diagnoses of complex-(p)TSD, borderline personality disorder, and fibromyalgia, as well as chronic feelings of alienation and isolation. Working on this novel has been a necessary and illuminating process in my ongoing recovery, as well as a major project that has sustained me through the last few years of a chronic illness which left me housebound, hungry, and alone.</p><p>When I was thirteen, I started reading zines, and in my mid-teens, I started making my own. My twin and I made a few zines together before we started making them on our own. Telegram is a zine I’ve been making for fifteen years. Early issues told personal stories on coping with loneliness in a small town, living inside books, and seeking magical friendships. Eventually, I wrote about mental illnesses, psych wards, chronic pain, disability, social assistance, and witchcraft, and in later issues, I wrote more about politicizing these experiences and re-imagining my writing as not only personal, but as spiritual and political contributions to mad and crip communities and lineages.

Stay witchy!</p></div>","♥ About the Novel ♥♥ We Are the Weirdos ♥In this work of experimental fiction and magic realism, Maranda Elizabeth writes a vulnerable tale of perpetually misunderstood and powerless teenagers in a small town. We Are the Weirdos is an exploration of trauma, gender, poverty, invalidation, and memory, as well as themes of trust, abandonment, confinement, and revenge. The characters encounter one another, as well as authority figures and ghosts, at home and through institutions: school, court cells, a detention centre, and a group home, dreaming of magic and escape.Indigo is a 13-year old goth and teenage criminal with a history of antisocial tendencies, shoplifting, destructive impulses, cutting, and dysmorphia/dysphoria. When they start bleeding petals and flames along with their blood, they make connections between alienation, magic, and survival.Grey is Indigo’s best friend, a shy trans girl with stolen Sharpies and heavy sketchbooks whose illustrations come to life and make spells come true.Both are the only children of poor, depressed, single moms in a small, mostly-white town in Southern Ontario. In 1999, their favourite movie is The Craft, their favourite band is Marilyn Manson, and their favourite activity is spell-casting. When they find a book about witchcraft hidden among a series of letters written to and from their mothers, who claim not to know each other and refuse to speak – one is mostly-absent, the other is obsessed with a talk show hosted by a psychic and Saturday night episodes of Cops – they choose to communicate with ghosts, and each other, instead.As the two are separated, and Indigo is charged with crimes they barely remember committing, each of them continue casting spells – or trying to – in dangerous and painful attempts to stay alive. Shuffled through the juvenile injustice system, Indigo encounters Sea, a clumsy and curious social worker who hates her job and feels complicit in the pain of teenagers, and Mint, a 16-year old Black girl with a stick-and-poke tattoo of moon phases on her wrist, rage of her own about isolation and incarceration, and a longer sentence for a non-violent crime.Each of them wants to be believed, to be real, and to create their own form of justice.♥ About the Author ♥♥ Maranda Elizabeth ♥I spent my babyhood years living in a haunted house in a rural area, where I developed psychic connections with my twin, and with the ghosts in our home. In early childhood, my mom, twin, & I moved to a small town on Ojibway/Chippewa and Anishinabek land, also known as Lindsay, Ontario. As a misfit goth teenager who grew up watching 18+ shows on Showcase TV with the volume turned low, I was told by grown-ups that when I escape my small town, I need to find a way to live on Queen West, where the weirdos are. And now I do! I do my writing and magic-making from my bachelorex apartment on the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee and the Métis, also known as the city of Toronto (from the Haudenosaunee word Tkaronto), Ontario. I've lived here for four and a half years, and plan to stay until my building crumbles in on me.I’m a capital-C Crazy writer, zinester, witch, identical twin, high school dropout, cane-user, recovering alcoholic with 6+ years sober, cripple-goth, and white non-binary amethyst-femme.

<h3></h3>
<p>My name is Kittana. I’m a single mother. I am a
survivor of both childhood
sexual abuse and of domestic abuse as an adult. I live with Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.  I was diagnosed at age
24. I had always had symptoms but at that time in my life I had gone through a
particularly rough time and as a result of the stress I was triggered into a
depression. I was sent to my family doctor who referred me to a psychologist.
It took several weeks to get in with the psychologist. During this time no
other form of help was offered to me. When I finally saw the psychologist I
advised him that I was interested in exploring non medicinal methods for help
first. He sent me home advising me to talk about what happened to me and that I
would be called at a later date to refer me to treatment. I never received that
call. </p>
<p>Years later I found myself in an abusive marriage with a
newborn who nearly died at birth, and naturally I was triggered quite
seriously. Luckily I recognized the trigger and went straight to my doctor. He
wasted no time referring me to a psychologist and this time I accepted medical
treatment. I was prescribed anti-depressants and placed on a wait list for both
a psychologist and for survivor groups. The wait for a psychologist was 2
years. The wait for the groups was 9 months to a year. </p>
<p>Andy Borrowitz once tweeted: “If only mental health care
were as easy to get as say..a gun.”</p>
<p>The anti-depressants helped, but they had many side effects
that only served to displace my symptoms. What I really needed was therapy.
There was nothing I could do. No one told me what other options were available.
I was just sent on my way. The only person who checked in on me was my doctor.
I’m fortunate that I had him at the time. </p>
<p>So I was left on my own to try and find ways to cope and
feeling very alone. A new mom in an abusive marriage with no one available to
talk to. I used the internet to research my condition and stumbled (luckily)
unto a chat group. It was heavily moderated by persons who had no experience in
helping and had no clue how to deal with people who suffered from PTSD, however
the chat group was probably the best thing for me at the time. The simple act
of reading others experiences and sharing my own was what got me through. </p>
<p>I eventually left my husband and the shelter I was in moved
me to a new city, as a result I was removed from the wait list without being
offered any alternatives or options in my area. I still have never received
treatment for my condition, but I am better prepared to handle my situation and
this came from reading others experiences. 
I opened up publicly and received many emails from people who suffer
from PTSD and other conditions thanking me, telling me that reading my story
helped them. It was very hard to write. There are many triggers in reliving
what happened to me. But the emails got me through it!</p>
<p>If a simple blog helped so many, imagine what a book could
do?  Because of this, I want to write my
story and share it in hopes that it might help anyone, even one person. I'm not writing a ""woe is me"" story. I'm writing a ""this happened and I got through it, and continue to do so..and so can you!"" story. But I don't want to stop there. There are others who have survival stories contributing to this. It's a compilation of survival stories so that others can see that this is possible! You don't choose to become a victim, but you can choose to be a survivor. No one can take that from you.

<p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","My name is Kittana. I’m a single mother. I am a
survivor of both childhood
sexual abuse and of domestic abuse as an adult. I live with Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.  I was diagnosed at age
24. I had always had symptoms but at that time in my life I had gone through a
particularly rough time and as a result of the stress I was triggered into a
depression. I was sent to my family doctor who referred me to a psychologist.
It took several weeks to get in with the psychologist. During this time no
other form of help was offered to me. When I finally saw the psychologist I
advised him that I was interested in exploring non medicinal methods for help
first. He sent me home advising me to talk about what happened to me and that I
would be called at a later date to refer me to treatment. I never received that
call. 
Years later I found myself in an abusive marriage with a
newborn who nearly died at birth, and naturally I was triggered quite
seriously. Luckily I recognized the trigger and went straight to my doctor. He
wasted no time referring me to a psychologist and this time I accepted medical
treatment. I was prescribed anti-depressants and placed on a wait list for both
a psychologist and for survivor groups. The wait for a psychologist was 2
years. The wait for the groups was 9 months to a year. 
Andy Borrowitz once tweeted: “If only mental health care
were as easy to get as say..a gun.”
The anti-depressants helped, but they had many side effects
that only served to displace my symptoms. What I really needed was therapy.
There was nothing I could do. No one told me what other options were available.
I was just sent on my way. The only person who checked in on me was my doctor.
I’m fortunate that I had him at the time. 
So I was left on my own to try and find ways to cope and
feeling very alone. A new mom in an abusive marriage with no one available to
talk to. I used the internet to research my condition and stumbled (luckily)
unto a chat group. It was heavily moderated by persons who had no experience in
helping and had no clue how to deal with people who suffered from PTSD, however
the chat group was probably the best thing for me at the time. The simple act
of reading others experiences and sharing my own was what got me through. 
I eventually left my husband and the shelter I was in moved
me to a new city, as a result I was removed from the wait list without being
offered any alternatives or options in my area. I still have never received
treatment for my condition, but I am better prepared to handle my situation and
this came from reading others experiences. 
I opened up publicly and received many emails from people who suffer
from PTSD and other conditions thanking me, telling me that reading my story
helped them. It was very hard to write. There are many triggers in reliving
what happened to me. But the emails got me through it!
If a simple blog helped so many, imagine what a book could
do?  Because of this, I want to write my
story and share it in hopes that it might help anyone, even one person. I'm not writing a ""woe is me"" story. I'm writing a ""this happened and I got through it, and continue to do so..and so can you!"" story. But I don't want to stop there. There are others who have survival stories contributing to this. It's a compilation of survival stories so that others can see that this is possible! You don't choose to become a victim, but you can choose to be a survivor. No one can take that from you. This book will be proof!
Writing a book takes a lot of time and dedication. It also costs a lot of money to edit and publish. As a result, I need help to make this
happen.  I am asking for donations to

<h2>Mali has a unique opportunity to take a step towards more transparent and credible governance, but it will not happen without active citizen participation.</h2>
<p>When Mali's elected President Amadou Toumani Toure was deposed in a coup in March of last year, many in the West and in the Malian diaspora quickly called for a return to democracy. But many Malians living in the country have long been disenchanted with Mali's democracy. Weak institutions, entrenched corruption, and political parties acting largely in their own interests have led to poor governance and to a lack of confidence among voters.</p>
<p>Mali's relatively young democracy has never seen voter turnout crack 40%. What's more, many voters have cast ballots for the wrong reasons. Political parties have in the past openly distributed foodstuffs, fabrics, and sometimes cash, to win favor with voters.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>As Mali prepares to hold elections for the first time in 6 years, an organization of Malians has been formed to ensure that Mali's democracy does not exist in name only. SOS Démocratie has two objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>To raise voter turnout in Mali </strong></li>
<li>
<p><strong>To ensure transparency, liberty, and credibility with respect to voters' choices </strong></p>
</li>
</ol><h2>Projects</h2>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">To achieve these objectives, SOS Démocratie is undertaking several projects:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Town hall meetings to raise voter turnout and identify issues. </strong>This is an outreach program that sends volunteer members of the group to Mali's various communes and districts to engage citizens through a “day of action and awareness.” This program involves meeting with local leadership and inviting residents to attend a town hall style event hosted by SOS Démocratie. This event is interactive, with questions like “How has democracy in Mali functioned so far? How has Mali arrived at its current situation? What needs to change?” The ultimate goal with this program is to catalog issues that are important to the voters in that locality and to show to voters why their active participation in Mali's democracy is imperative.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advocacy with respect to issues raised in town hall meetings. </strong>Another component of SOS Démocratie involves pressuring the government and candidates themselves to respond to concerns raised by voters in these town halls. The group will lobby for public exchanges between candidates that can be broadcast on television and radio. SOS Démocratie will also pressure candidates to be forthright and transparent with respect to their political platform.</li>
<li>
<strong>A short comedy film that shows how Mali's political culture has been flawed while explaining how things can be better. </strong>To complement these activities, SOS Démocratie is working with a local theater troupe to release a sketch comedy film that will underscore the group's political message. The script is complete and the sketch was recently performed live to an audience in Bamako. The next step is to film the sketch and to distribute it far and wide via DVD, USB key, and cellphone p2p transfers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Election monitoring through Ushahidi, an open source mapping platform. </strong>Finally, SOS Démocratie plans to create a citizens network for monitoring elections (whenever they happen) using the <span style=""color: #000080;""><span lang=""zxx""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.ushahidi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ushahidi.com/</a></span></span></span> platform.</li>
</ul><h2>Funding needs</h2>
<p>The group has already held the first “day of action and awareness” in the Bamako neighborhood of Fadjiguila and now plans to launch its national campaign. While we have streamlined costs as much as possible (all members are volunteers and lodging and food, when not offered, will be sought at an inexpensive level), we have the following needs that require funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Production and distribution costs for the film</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logistics costs for traveling volunteers (transport, food, lodging)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchased airtime on TV and radio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audio equipment (for recording town hall meetings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous expenses (phone credit, printing materials etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Transforming Mali's political culture will not be easy, but the country's current situation provides a unique opportunity to take a step towards better governance. Mali cannot afford another government that is not representative of its people. Consider supporting SOS Démocratie in their efforts to help Mali build a credible democracy.  </p>
<h2>Skeptical? </h2>
<p>There is good reason to be skeptical when it comes to Mali's 2013 Presidential elections. The northern town of Kidal is still held by the rebel group MNLA, there are lingering security concerns in other northern cities, and much of Mali's public administration has not returned to the region. In addition, many Malians are internally displaced and hundreds of thousands of refugees remain in neighborhing countries. Many have called Mali's July elections premature and there are legitimate doubts about the country's ability to properly organize polling.</p>
<p>All of that said, it appears that elections will move forward on their current scheduled timeline, which makes the grassroots work of SOS Democracy all the more important. While international organizations and the Malian government try to coordinate the large machinery of bureaucracy to sensitize people ahead of the elections, here is a group of Malian activists that are putting in their own time, explaining to people not just how to vote, but <em>why</em> to vote, because the future of their country matters to them. Any money you contribute will go directly to a very streamlined and efficient effort to transform Mali's poltical culture, an effort that has been initiated by concerned Malians. </p>
<h2>Not a one time effort</h2>
<p>While we are asking for funding that will assist SOS Democracy's efforts ahead of the presidential elections, the work does not end there. The same plan of action will be implemented before Mali's legislative and municipal elections, which in many ways have a more tangible impact on local communities. This project is not about one presidential election, it is about redefining democracy and changing Mali's political culture over the long-term. </p>

<p>En mars 2012, aussi bien la communauté internationale que la diaspora malienne ont condamné le coup d’Etat qui a renversé le président malien Amadou Toumani Touré. Tous ont exigé un retour à l’ordre constitutionnel normal. Or, pour beaucoup de Maliens vivant dans le pays, le contrat de confiance avec la République avait été rompu. Pour ces Maliens déçus par la démocratie, les nombreux maux socio-économiques viennent de la mauvaise pratique de la démocratie, qui n’était en fait à leurs yeux qu’une façade. La faiblesse des institutions, l’enracinement de la corruption, le manque d’opposition malgré la pléthore de partis politiques – mais sans aucun projet de société concret – figurent parmi les raisons de la mauvaise gouvernance, qui a, elle, conduit à un manque de confiance généralisé.</p>
<p><br/>En vingt (20) ans de pratique dite démocratique par l’opinion internationale, le Mali n'a pourtant jamais connu plus de 40% de participation aux différents suffrages électoraux. Et dans la plupart des cas, ceux qui ont voté l’ont fait pour de mauvaises raisons, sans vraiment comprendre le sens de leur vote ou simplement en ‘monnayant’ leur voix contre de l’argent ou d’autres biens matériels. Ce n’est un secret pour personne que la pratique courante des partis politiques était de distribuer des billets de mille (1000F) francs CFA, du thé, du sucre, des t-shirts, des pagnes, des marmites, etc. pour ‘acheter’ les voix des électeurs. </p>
<h2>Objectifs</h2>
<p><br/>A l’approche des prochaines échéances électorales, prévues pour juillet 2013, notre organisation citoyenne SOS Démocratie compte contribuer à la correction du système démocratique malien : s’assurer que la démocratie au Mali ne soit pas simplement de façade mais bien la vraie application d’un pouvoir choisi par la majorité du peuple conformément à ses idéaux et en toute indépendance.

Les modules développés au cours de ces journées de sensibilisation seront interactifs. Des discussions autour de questions telle que : comment fonctionnait la démocratie au Mali de 1991 à nos jours? Qu'est-ce qui a marché ? Que devrait t-on changer ? L’objectif ultime de ce programme est de recenser les questions importantes aux yeux des électeurs et de les convaincre que la démocratie ne saurait fonctionner sans leur participation active tant individuelle que collective. </li>
<li>L’organisation de groupes de lobbying auprès des candidats eux-mêmes afin d’organiser des débats répondant aux préoccupations des populations recensées lors des journées de sensibilisation.

<li>En plus de ces activités, SOS Démocratie a également élaboré en collaboration avec une troupe de théâtre (Groupe Yérèdon) un sketch pour mieux sensibiliser les populations à propos des différents enjeux démocratiques et des modalités de vote lors des prochaines élections.

<p>Fort d'une expérience de 15 années dans le milieu de la mode et de la photo de mode en tant que styliste de plateau, directeur artistique et journaliste spécialisé en mode et joaillerie, j'ai fondé le magazine ""<strong>Blake</strong>"" en novembre 2007 qui fût le 1er magazine masculin online en France. Ce magazine est un magazine mode et lifestyle s'adressant à des lecteurs entre 30 et 45 ans. Loin des diktats des magazines habituels qui vous disent ce qu'il faut ou ne faut pas porter, ""<strong>Blake</strong>"" adopte une liberté de tons et un principe simple: si cela nous plait, nous en parlons, mais nous n'êtes pas obligé d'être d'accord avec nous!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GiliEstlinHirsch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gili Estlin Hirsch</a>. <img alt=""Gili Estlin Hirsch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/giliimage01.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Gili Estlin Hirsch""/>I’m 26, and I am a queer writer and a poet. I've been writing my whole life and words are the very core of who I am. Growing up, it was difficult to find representations of myself in art, especially literature. So I decided to create a queer story, my story, in poems, to provide a fair and accurate representation of LGBTQ* folk in literary art.</p>
<p>What I hope to accomplish with this campaign is to self-publish this queer story as a collection of poems in my first book, titled ANNA, and in the process help establish a stronger representation of queer and LGBT folk in literature. I believe queer and LGBT folk are severely underrepresented in art, especially in literary art, and I believe it is time to change that.</p>
<p><img alt=""Alex Ogden"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/AO01.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Alex Ogden""/>ANNA contains 50 original poems written by me, Gili Estlin Hirsch, and 25 original illustrations hand-drawn by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Alex-Ogden/361822313918234"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alex Ogden</a>. Through these words and images combined, ANNA depicts a complex queer love story between two women, a story that I believe queer and LGBT folk will feel represented by. A story we can ALL relate to.</p>
<p>ANNA is the first book in a series of projects within a larger movement called <a href=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/applesetc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apples Etc.</a> Two years ago, I started Apples, Etc., as an art collective that set out to achieve two main goals: one, to create immediate, relevant, live poetry, that can be as relevant and as comforting as any other medium of art; and two, to strive to create, in the short and long run, a better, more accurate, less stereotypical and safer representation in all art—but especially literary art—of LGBTQ* folk, folks like me. <img alt=""Body of Work"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/BodyofWork.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title='""Body of Work""'/>To end the terrible slicing of the population in at least one way: to create full, multi-faceted art that will represent everyone, that will give queer and LGBT folk an opportunity to see themselves reflected, that holy right I yearned for so many times as a child and as an adult, that I yearn for still. Basically, I couldn’t find a living, breathing, queer love story. So I decided to write one.</p>
<p class=""_553k"">In addition to ANNA, Alex Ogden and I have already completed another project for Apples, Etc. Our first project, <a href=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/bow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Body of Work,""</a> is a unique visual representation of my poetry written on the human body and photographed by Alex.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img alt=""i has a money"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/ihasamoney.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""i has a money""/>The book is gathered and edited, but we still need funds to print paperback and e-book copies of ANNA. Our goal is to print paperback copies through our publishing company, Fox &amp; Owl Press, for distribution and review by late fall 2013.</p>
<p><em>Regardless of whether or not we meet our funding goal, ALL claimed perks will be created and distributed to funders.</em></p>
<p>What's most important for us is that ANNA is shared and enjoyed by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>This campaign includes original material you won't find elsewhere. Poetry written by Gili Estlin Hirsch and illustrations by Alex Ogden, meticulously collected throughout months, is now available for the first time as a bound collection. The illustrations are tied with the words and produce a new kind of poetry; immediate, relevant, and fresh. ANNA aspires to offer queer and LGBT folk a more accurate representation in art. In essence, it is a queer love story, so this campaign is for better representation of queer and LGBT folk in art.</p>
<p>There are options to acquire items which won't be released to the public after this campaign closes, such as: limited hardcover editions of ANNA; hand-drawn, personalized illustrations; a fine art quality photo book of the first Apples, Etc. project, “Body of Work;” and even a personalized poem written especially for you by Gili Estlin Hirsch.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The Core Philosophy</h3>
<p><img alt=""G.E. Hirsch writing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://giliestlinhirsch.com/GEHwriting2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""words""/>I believe I am here to change the way we see poetry, to help others be touched by poetry and to make a difference in the world. The experience of seeing yourself reflected in any form of media is a transcendental one. There is something holy and magical about reading a book or listening to a song and relating to it from the deepest part of yourself. Members of the LGBTQ* community are constantly having to bridge gender differences in their minds in order to enjoy art, and we constantly scour pages to find our so desperately needed reflection in literature. That is why I created ANNA -- because I believe we as LGBTQ* folk deserve to have better and more profound representation in art. The poems as well as the illustrations in ANNA depict genderqueer, trans, butch, boi and LGBT folk, and create a deep sense of empathy which we hope will resonate with readers from the LGBTQ* community. ANNA is a book meant to give a response to the stark underrepresentation of LGBTQ* folk in art.</p>

Hello,
My name is Gili Estlin Hirsch. I’m 26, and I am a queer writer and a poet. I've been writing my whole life and words are the very core of who I am. Growing up, it was difficult to find representations of myself in art, especially literature. So I decided to create a queer story, my story, in poems, to provide a fair and accurate representation of LGBTQ* folk in literary art.
What I hope to accomplish with this campaign is to self-publish this queer story as a collection of poems in my first book, titled ANNA, and in the process help establish a stronger representation of queer and LGBT folk in literature. I believe queer and LGBT folk are severely underrepresented in art, especially in literary art, and I believe it is time to change that.
ANNA contains 50 original poems written by me, Gili Estlin Hirsch, and 25 original illustrations hand-drawn by Alex Ogden. Through these words and images combined, ANNA depicts a complex queer love story between two women, a story that I believe queer and LGBT folk will feel represented by. A story we can ALL relate to.
ANNA is the first book in a series of projects within a larger movement called Apples Etc. Two years ago, I started Apples, Etc., as an art collective that set out to achieve two main goals: one, to create immediate, relevant, live poetry, that can be as relevant and as comforting as any other medium of art; and two, to strive to create, in the short and long run, a better, more accurate, less stereotypical and safer representation in all art—but especially literary art—of LGBTQ* folk, folks like me. To end the terrible slicing of the population in at least one way: to create full, multi-faceted art that will represent everyone, that will give queer and LGBT folk an opportunity to see themselves reflected, that holy right I yearned for so many times as a child and as an adult, that I yearn for still. Basically, I couldn’t find a living, breathing, queer love story. So I decided to write one.
In addition to ANNA, Alex Ogden and I have already completed another project for Apples, Etc. Our first project, ""Body of Work,"" is a unique visual representation of my poetry written on the human body and photographed by Alex.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The book is gathered and edited, but we still need funds to print paperback and e-book copies of ANNA. Our goal is to print paperback copies through our publishing company, Fox & Owl Press, for distribution and review by late fall 2013.
Regardless of whether or not we meet our funding goal, ALL claimed perks will be created and distributed to funders.
What's most important for us is that ANNA is shared and enjoyed by as many people as possible.
This campaign includes original material you won't find elsewhere. Poetry written by Gili Estlin Hirsch and illustrations by Alex Ogden, meticulously collected throughout months, is now available for the first time as a bound collection. The illustrations are tied with the words and produce a new kind of poetry; immediate, relevant, and fresh. ANNA aspires to offer queer and LGBT folk a more accurate representation in art. In essence, it is a queer love story, so this campaign is for better representation of queer and LGBT folk in art.
There are options to acquire items which won't be released to the public after this campaign closes, such as: limited hardcover editions of ANNA; hand-drawn, personalized illustrations; a fine art quality photo book of the first Apples, Etc. project, “Body of Work;” and even a personalized poem written especially for you by Gili Estlin Hirsch.
 
The Core Philosophy
I believe I am here to change the way we see poetry, to help others be touched by poetry and to make a difference in the world. The experience of seeing yourself reflected in any form of media is a transcendental one. There is something holy and magical about reading a book or listening to a song and relating to it from the deepest part of yourself. Members of the LGBTQ* community are constantly having to bridge gender differences in their minds in order to enjoy art, and we constantly scour pages to find our so desperately needed reflection in literature. That is why I created ANNA -- because I believe we as LGBTQ* folk deserve to have better and more profound representation in art. The poems as well as the illustrations in ANNA depict genderqueer, trans, butch, boi and LGBT folk, and create a deep sense of empathy which we hope will resonate with readers from the LGBTQ* community. ANNA is a book meant to give a response to the stark underrepresentation of LGBTQ* folk in art.
This combination of verbal art and visual art is unique and new. Together, the illustrations and the poems create the story as one, making the words, as it were, come alive.
When you support our campaign, you become a member of the Apples, Etc., movement, coming together with artists, poets and lovers of art and words to create a world that is better by the words we leave in it. You are also supporting better representation of LGBTQ* folk in literary art.

The Ocean in Every Drop
We will use whatever funding we receive to print ANNA and promote Apples, Etc. as a movement in order to achieve better representation of LGBTQ* folk in the literary arts. We will reinvest in the movement so that we can reach out to even more people, and work even harder to create multi-faceted poetry that touches each and everyone of us.
You are not just a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.
-Rumi
 
A Selection of Poems from ANNA:
MORE OR LESS
Maybe because of the heat,Everything looks dusty and railed todayLike a healed scratch down the backOf someone I never knew.Made with passion,But embedded in the skinFor good.You and I were like thatLittle archways that never let us restAnd now when I look at your photos,I think,What was itWas itJust a dream? I can'tRemember a thing you saidOnly the taste of your mouthAnd the touch of your hands.
The hallway looks suddenlyLike a perfect place for a wake.We'll put a table thereAnd there'll be citrus and meat on itAnd everyone will talk aboutHow beautiful and rich and thick it wasAnd talented and hookedAnd no one will mention all the warsAnd all the stupid slaps to the faceAnd apex of ourConjoined hands.
I told them,Look,It was what it was.And I don't know her anymoreBut can you really peel a scratchOff your skin like that?Not even with rubbing alcohol,My love100% proof won't help you,Or should I say meor maybe usHere
Leaning at bus stops with your goddamn cigarette, I don't think I've everLoved youMoreOr Less
 
MICAH THE PROPHET
I found you Walking barefootOn the hinges of your wisdomAt Massachusetts Ave:A clerk,For all intents and purposes,Of the apocalypseThat is bitingAt the heelsOf us all.You spoke softly,Ambling hushed, Head Bowed,At one personification of commerce Where Bates and Raleigh meet.You explained that you had no children,And she saw that you had no shoes.Your creased hand curledDisturbed her.She walked away,Defiant.Your dry skin at the cement made a cracking soundLike a bobby pin falling from the headOf a gauche dark childAt a ballet recital full of white mothers,Hitting the floor thundering Once,ThenN e v e r a g a i n.
 
SCHULTZ
there is a small silken graveyard pressedbetween my ribs, and sounding there isa muted hush of all the breaths of the walking-things we tried to savehe and iand kept in boxes in his room, contractingall manners of diseases;and more loudly all those we could not saveand never knew to try.you stir there quietly sometimes among them,flush against my spineflinching from the lines in the path even in your sleep,so afraid there is a curse there,in the space between one tileand the next.

Jung, Goddess spirituality and astrology, tools that help us access the Feminine Spirit within us.  The products of our right-brain, “feminine” thinking - stories, dreams, symbols, myths and fairy tales - speak to our hearts, delivering Wisdom’s messages. </p>
<p>The idea for this book came from a dream I had while training at the C. G. Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzerland in the early 80s.  At the time, I had four young children, a foundering marriage, and a burning need for self-discovery, and to find my life’s purpose.</p>
<p><em>“I dreamed there was a wounded lion loose in our town and I had to protect my children.  Suddenly (in the way of dreams), I found myself sitting in a buckboard wagon at a three-way crossroads, waiting while people around me went searching for the lion.  Suddenly I saw a waning moon in the sky and a giant tidal wave looming overhead.  I thought ‘This is it’ as the wave came down on me.  Suddenly I looked up into a clear sky with a waxing crescent moon above me and a voice said, “You will be the mother of a savior.”  </em></p>
<p>Quite a mission statement!  Not only overwhelming, but magical!   And because I was there in Zurich, studying the Unconscious and how dreams connect us to our soul, I had to listen.   The wounded lion was symbolic of my own lack of self-confidence as a woman, as well as my generation’s wounded sense of grown-up responsibility.  Parents are responsible for saving our world for our children’s sake.  The second part of the dream is clearly an indication that it is Feminine Spirit which will guide this change.  The archetypal nature of this dream made me realize it was not just for me but for all women.  (This dream is interpreted in the book.)</p>
<p>This dream set me on the road to discovering not only who I am but also my life’s purpose.  As I worked with the images from this dream, they led me to an image of the Divine Feminine who gives birth to the new age we are fast approaching.  And I learned that the Divine Feminine is returning at this time as Wisdom, so sorely needed in our troubled world. The dream also led me to a tale that explains how women can leave the 'father's house' and find our own unique feminine standpoint.</p>
<p>In living what I learned and following the different threads that were woven through the dream, <em>Wisdom’s Daughters</em> was born.   I believe that this life’s work will not only help other women re-discover their own connection to Feminine Wisdom,  but will enable women to birth a new world guided by wisdom instead of ignorance, love instead of hatred, peace instead of war, and cooperation instead of selfish individualism.   </p>
<p>I have counseled and taught women what I’ve learned, and I can see the good it does them.  Women find freedom once we leave the ‘f<em>ather’s house</em> ‘ of patriarchal rules.  What we do with our freedom is up to us, but I believe that it leads us to using our Feminine Wisdom - the great gift of our female body and psyche - so that this divine gift can heal our lives and our world.</p>
<p>Through the years as I raised my children, helped women find their freedom, and continued to learn Lady Wisdom’s lessons, I submitted this manuscript for publication.  While many editors praised my writing, I saw there was little interest in works on feminine spirituality.  So now I want to self-publish it, especially in light of what is going on with women’s issues here in America and around the world.  It is time for all women to be free and equal, which also means allowing for our differences.   It is time we honor and use our right-brained, feminine consciousness to balance our masculine rational left-brain.</p>
<p>I have chosen to publish <em>Wisdom’s Daughters</em> through Balboa House, the self-publishing division of a new age publisher, Hay House.  My hope is that if <em>Wisdom’s Daughters</em> does well, Hay House will pick it up.  Balboa Press will market the book, turn it into an e-book, and distribute it to over 25,000 sellers and more.  I have chosen to go with their Master Package at $7,999.00 because it covers everything.</p>
<p>I am trying to raise at least $13,000.00.  After the initial $8,000.00 cost for publishing, I will also owe money to:</p>
<ol>
<li> Indigogo’s commission is either 9% or 4% - anywhere from $500 - $1,500 depending on how much I raise.</li>
<li> I’d like to pay a fee to the wonderful artist, Kerstin Zettmar, whose beautiful mixed media painting, ‘Aphrodite Arising’, will be my book cover.</li>
<li>I have over 25 poems or stories in the book that I need to get permission to use, which could require licensing fees up to $2500.00.</li>
<li>I need money to buy and ship my book to those of you who donate $100.00 +.</li>
<li>If your generous donations go over what I need, I plan to use the money to publish a separate workbook that goes along with Wisdom’s Daughters, with more information and exercises.</li>
<li> I’d love to pay my good friend, Valerie P, who volunteered to put my video together and spent 6 hours doing it.  Thanks V!</li>
</ol><p>Since I want to express my thanks to those of you who help me get this project off the ground, I have some gifts to give you.  Please take advantage of them if you want to.  Know that I appreciate everyone pitching in to help.  Think of it as a barn-raising!</p>
<p>I believe that women can change the world if we know ourselves and connect to the inner mystery of being female.  Men can also learn how to connect to their inner Wisdom, but having a wise woman in your life can speed up the process.  <em>Wisdom’s Daughters</em> will hopefully be read by women of all ages and even passed down from mother to daughter, until all women are free and comfortable with this blessed gift.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing ADAP- Advertising for Authors and Publishers</strong></p>
<p><strong>ADAP is Advertising for Authors and Publishers – a marketing platform that balances the needs of both readers and authors.</strong>ADAP will give self-publishing authors new opportunities to create revenue from their hard work. In short, ADAP helps Authors earn money writing.</p>
<p>Most readers of ebooks enjoy a good free ebook novel and after all; who doesn’t want something free? Unfortunately, that’s a not very sustainable model for publishers and self-publishing authors. Piracy is rampant and odious copy protection and DRM schemes have become the norm among large publishers and ebook retailers. So how do we reconcile the two conflicting needs for monetizing ebooks by publishers and authors versus keeping ebooks low cost or for free for potential fans? (<a href=""http://www.bookim.org/adap-is-now-on-indiegogo/adap-en-espanol/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ADAP en Español</a>)</p>
<p>Well, to answer that question let’s go back nine years ago to my own personal journey. At that time I my professional career included several opportunities as an Internet Marketer and software application product manager at two different Fortune 1000 companies.  However; I always had a keen interest in writing fiction and found my inspiration in a chance archaeological discovery on a small Indonesian island in 2003. That year archaeologist Mike Morwood discovered in a cave on Flores Island the remains of a small hominid named Homo floresiensis, an ancestral relative of ours that as an adult stood only three feet and were almost hobbit-like in appearance with comically large feet. More shockingly the remains he found were only 13,000 years old making them contemporaries with modern human beings. Even more surprising, a few scientists even wondered if some of these diminutive people could still be alive deep in the shelter of some primordial forest!</p>
<p>Having formally trained as a biologist I began entertaining the idea about how their re-discovery could have the makings of a grand science fiction adventure story. As I wrote, the novel evolved and grew from a simple rousing adventure story to a much deeper examination of the human condition. The novel began with your prototypical protagonist named Richard Staller, an American scientist with a predisposition towards alcoholism and womanizing. There was to be the obligatory love interest in Richard’s associate, the attractive but somewhat bitter Sarah. However; as the novel evolved it was Sarah that became the focus of the hero’s journey; partly because of her complex and sometimes brittle personality but more importantly because of her extraordinary powers of empathy for all sentient creatures. To paraphrase John Irving, I had become obsessed and I was staying obsessed with my writing. Through time, the novel evolved from a simple adventure novel to a complex novel with a unique heroine.<img alt=""The Flores Girl Novels on Indiegogo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bookim.org/images/FloresGirl%20_Novels2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Flores Girl Novels""/></p>
<p> <strong>Authors Face Money Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Now to be honest with you writing my first novel was a bit bumpy in the beginning but as I resolved the issues of writing my first novel that had now morphed into a full trilogy, I faced the biggest challenge confronting all authors: the book publishing industry. It was always a tough industry to compete in, moreover; technical convergence wasn’t making it any easier to navigate for new authors. Frankly, the statistics for most writers are fairly grim considering there are far more lottery winners than there are successful authors. And even self-publishing authors need money for the marketing and editing of their novels. Yet, the only thing scarier than facing a blank page or no money for an author is the eminent danger of facing total obscurity and having no readers altogether.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sad Facts About Writing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bookim.org/images/Indiegogo_InfoGraphic2%20.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sad Facts About Writing""/></p>
<p>My Internet marketing background made me realize that book promotion was all about collecting eyeballs; reader’s eyeballs that is. Get enough eyeballs and the money will come; it was a basic monetizing concept that drove much of the Internet’s growth. Furthermore; free works and in fact; my first free Flores Girl novel has been downloaded a staggering 350,000 times. That's a significant audience and that's very appealing to potential advertisers; after all, most book readers are better educated and more likely to have more disposable incomes than your typical television or radio audience member.</p>
<p>I wanted to address this monetizing challenge for all authors and using my contacts within the industry I have developed a new ebook marketing program called ADAP, Advertising for Authors and Publishers. This new advertising platform allows authors and independent publishers an opportunity to create new revenue streams in a manner that is unobtrusive to the reader. When I say publishers I am referring to the independent publishers who work with self-publishing authors to give them their start in the business.</p>
<p>ADAP creates a win-win for authors and readers by placing a series of tasteful interstitials that are relevant to the reader strategically throughout the novel, as for example at the end of a chapter. The experience is very much in line with what is seen with traditional periodic publishing and actually harkens back to the early days of novel serialization within magazines. If something catches your interest you can choose to read the ad copy and perhaps select the hyperlink; if not, you can simply move on to the next page in the novel and continue with your reading uninterrupted. In short, ADAP allows authors and small independent publishers the opportunity to monetize their efforts in a manner that is unobtrusive and in harmony with the ebook reader.</p>
<p><strong>Publishers Colluding at the Expense of Readers</strong></p>
<p>I know many of you are reading this campaign and are saying, “Oh no, I don’t want ads in my ebooks!” But like it or not ebook advertising is coming with Amazon already adding advertisements to their latest ebook readers and with Microsoft filing an ebook advertisement patent and investing over $300 million with Barnes and Noble. Worse; you know none of this advertising money is going to go to the authors and forget about the money benefiting the reader! In fact, the Justice Department has sued some of the largest book publishers in the industry for ebook price fixing. Now wouldn’t it be great if authors could discount or give away their ebooks altogether to readers with this new advertising revenue from the ADAP program?</p>
<p>The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise funds to set the specifications and for developing the beta version of the ADAP Cloud Technology Server platform necessary to implement the ADAP program. This infrastructure will handle the reader preferences and the downloading of the customized ebooks.</p>
<p>Moving forward; the ADAP program will bring leading members in the self-publishing and advertising world together in a joint effort towards making ADAP a viable new funding option for all authors. As ADAP grows additional authors and publishers will be added to the roster so that they too can share in the revenue benefits of the program.</p>
<p><strong>Ebook Readers How You Can Help!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Introducing ADAP- Advertising for Authors and Publishers
ADAP is Advertising for Authors and Publishers – a marketing platform that balances the needs of both readers and authors.ADAP will give self-publishing authors new opportunities to create revenue from their hard work. In short, ADAP helps Authors earn money writing.
Most readers of ebooks enjoy a good free ebook novel and after all; who doesn’t want something free? Unfortunately, that’s a not very sustainable model for publishers and self-publishing authors. Piracy is rampant and odious copy protection and DRM schemes have become the norm among large publishers and ebook retailers. So how do we reconcile the two conflicting needs for monetizing ebooks by publishers and authors versus keeping ebooks low cost or for free for potential fans? (ADAP en Español)
Well, to answer that question let’s go back nine years ago to my own personal journey. At that time I my professional career included several opportunities as an Internet Marketer and software application product manager at two different Fortune 1000 companies.  However; I always had a keen interest in writing fiction and found my inspiration in a chance archaeological discovery on a small Indonesian island in 2003. That year archaeologist Mike Morwood discovered in a cave on Flores Island the remains of a small hominid named Homo floresiensis, an ancestral relative of ours that as an adult stood only three feet and were almost hobbit-like in appearance with comically large feet. More shockingly the remains he found were only 13,000 years old making them contemporaries with modern human beings. Even more surprising, a few scientists even wondered if some of these diminutive people could still be alive deep in the shelter of some primordial forest!
Having formally trained as a biologist I began entertaining the idea about how their re-discovery could have the makings of a grand science fiction adventure story. As I wrote, the novel evolved and grew from a simple rousing adventure story to a much deeper examination of the human condition. The novel began with your prototypical protagonist named Richard Staller, an American scientist with a predisposition towards alcoholism and womanizing. There was to be the obligatory love interest in Richard’s associate, the attractive but somewhat bitter Sarah. However; as the novel evolved it was Sarah that became the focus of the hero’s journey; partly because of her complex and sometimes brittle personality but more importantly because of her extraordinary powers of empathy for all sentient creatures. To paraphrase John Irving, I had become obsessed and I was staying obsessed with my writing. Through time, the novel evolved from a simple adventure novel to a complex novel with a unique heroine.
 Authors Face Money Challenges
Now to be honest with you writing my first novel was a bit bumpy in the beginning but as I resolved the issues of writing my first novel that had now morphed into a full trilogy, I faced the biggest challenge confronting all authors: the book publishing industry. It was always a tough industry to compete in, moreover; technical convergence wasn’t making it any easier to navigate for new authors. Frankly, the statistics for most writers are fairly grim considering there are far more lottery winners than there are successful authors. And even self-publishing authors need money for the marketing and editing of their novels. Yet, the only thing scarier than facing a blank page or no money for an author is the eminent danger of facing total obscurity and having no readers altogether.

My Internet marketing background made me realize that book promotion was all about collecting eyeballs; reader’s eyeballs that is. Get enough eyeballs and the money will come; it was a basic monetizing concept that drove much of the Internet’s growth. Furthermore; free works and in fact; my first free Flores Girl novel has been downloaded a staggering 350,000 times. That's a significant audience and that's very appealing to potential advertisers; after all, most book readers are better educated and more likely to have more disposable incomes than your typical television or radio audience member.
I wanted to address this monetizing challenge for all authors and using my contacts within the industry I have developed a new ebook marketing program called ADAP, Advertising for Authors and Publishers. This new advertising platform allows authors and independent publishers an opportunity to create new revenue streams in a manner that is unobtrusive to the reader. When I say publishers I am referring to the independent publishers who work with self-publishing authors to give them their start in the business.
ADAP creates a win-win for authors and readers by placing a series of tasteful interstitials that are relevant to the reader strategically throughout the novel, as for example at the end of a chapter. The experience is very much in line with what is seen with traditional periodic publishing and actually harkens back to the early days of novel serialization within magazines. If something catches your interest you can choose to read the ad copy and perhaps select the hyperlink; if not, you can simply move on to the next page in the novel and continue with your reading uninterrupted. In short, ADAP allows authors and small independent publishers the opportunity to monetize their efforts in a manner that is unobtrusive and in harmony with the ebook reader.
Publishers Colluding at the Expense of Readers
I know many of you are reading this campaign and are saying, “Oh no, I don’t want ads in my ebooks!” But like it or not ebook advertising is coming with Amazon already adding advertisements to their latest ebook readers and with Microsoft filing an ebook advertisement patent and investing over $300 million with Barnes and Noble. Worse; you know none of this advertising money is going to go to the authors and forget about the money benefiting the reader! In fact, the Justice Department has sued some of the largest book publishers in the industry for ebook price fixing. Now wouldn’t it be great if authors could discount or give away their ebooks altogether to readers with this new advertising revenue from the ADAP program?
The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise funds to set the specifications and for developing the beta version of the ADAP Cloud Technology Server platform necessary to implement the ADAP program. This infrastructure will handle the reader preferences and the downloading of the customized ebooks.
Moving forward; the ADAP program will bring leading members in the self-publishing and advertising world together in a joint effort towards making ADAP a viable new funding option for all authors. As ADAP grows additional authors and publishers will be added to the roster so that they too can share in the revenue benefits of the program.
Ebook Readers How You Can Help!
Well, to start you can participate in this Indiegogo campaign and to encourage you there are a number of different perk incentives to motivate you! There are the traditional offerings such as signed copies of the sequel by the author. Additionally, there is a new album of original music for Flores Girl that was produced and recorded by Georgia Harrigan that is now available.
However; if you own a business or are marketing your own book we encourage you to take advantage of the special ADAP advertising incentive. The ADAP incentive allows you to place interstitials within the Sacred and the Profane with your own personalized advertisement. We estimate that the ads have a value of $50 cost per thousand impressions in line with traditional print media, though the value could vary based on market conditions. If you don’t have an ad you can also do a tasteful personal shout-out using the existing templates we will offer shortly after the completion of the Indiegogo campaign. In the very near future additional authors and novels will also be added to the ADAP program as well. Monies raised beyond the initial goal will be used towards the actual application development and to hosting the cloud technology. More details about this important ADAP program and incentives are available in a separate ADAP video.
Even if you can’t contribute you can help by becoming a Flores Girl Fan by liking Flores Girl and downloading a free copy of the first ebook novel at www.facebook.com/FloresGirlNovel.

<div> </div>
<div>My name is Christopher and I used to belong to the Church of Scientology. I am from England and became a permanent resident of Canada in 1999.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I first became involved in the Church in January 1998 and had some impressive results in dealing with a situation that had been hanging around me for about 20 years. When I experienced the relief of being helped in this area I went to Toronto, Canada, to do 5 weeks of courses and auditing sessions. I went to Toronto because the person who had helped me over the months between 1997 and 1998 lived there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I eventually moved to Canada and married the woman who got me into Scientology in November 1998. Soon after I began to find out that there was something not quite right about the Church of Scientology.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The above video explains some of what happened to me and the campaign is all to do with raising awareness about this very corrupt and fraudulent Church, which is actually a business and has no religious standing in Canada, by placing full page display ads in three of the largest newspapers in Canada.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The number of $$$s I need is about $211,000 to place these display ads in these three papers on a Saturday. I am placing them in the Saturday edition because this day is when the papers are the most read by everyone.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is the breakdown of the costs:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Saturday editions b/w full page display ads:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Globe and Mail (National paper) - $89,763 inc hst</div>

<div>Toronto Sun (Toronto) - $7,232 inc hst</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This campaign is very important me and especially those who are thinking of going into the Church because of the fact that the Church defrauds people of the services that they get.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When people go and get services in the Church 99.99% of people think they are getting courses and auditing sessions with technology that has been created by L Ron Hubbard directly. This is actually not the case. If you look at any of the books which the basic courses are based on, the copyright page says ""Based on the works of L Ron Hubbard"". This is how the Chuch gets away with providing services which do more harm than good, though at the basic level you do get some wins due to the fact that the basic courses are pretty much as L Ron Hubbard intended them to be and so are very effective. When people experience this effectiveness they want more naturally. This is where the con is - the hook is the effectiveness of these courses at the bottom but the further you go in buying services the more changed the services are from the originals. So much so, that one ends up spending thousands of $$s before one knows it without there being as much gain in one's well-being as at the lower levels, and in some cases being worse off than before one got involved with this organization.</div>

<h3>The Pitch...</h3>
<p><i>In the Midlands of England stands the Wentworth Academy for Young Ladies of Distinction, a respected establishment for the schooling of wealthy young women. Yet it has another, secret side. Separate from the main school is the Bloodgood House – a place where girls with “special” requirements are housed. Now, as spring deepens into summer in 1875, there are five girls in residence:</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Diana Silverthorn</strong> – Bookish, shy Diana has an addiction to penny dreadful tales of airship pirates and swashbuckling adventure – especially the stories of the fearsome Captain Hawk — and spends her time writing torrid pirate adventures she never lets anyone see. It is an unusual pursuit for a young woman, yet not as unusual as the heavy bracelets she must wear to control her magnetic affliction, which can cause every metallic object in a room to be attracted to her.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Rebecca Baltimore</strong> – An American girl of a new-money family, Rebecca has been sent to the Academy to try and educate her in spite of her forceful and wayward nature. Rebecca is athletic, adventurous, and very, very strong — so strong she is given a special drink every day at bedtime to make her weak and docile.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Vittra Valdenheld </strong>– A quick, intelligent girl with an inquisitive mind and a fierce sense of loyalty, Vittra is very fond of animals of all kinds – especially dangerous ones. She is not allowed any meat, and is given an injection whenever she becomes agitated.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Echo Killwinter</strong> – A pale, distracted girl who sings, stays up late, and covets fancy clothes, Echo might seem the least odd of the group. And yet she cannot abide the sunlight, and is allowed to eat only a specially-formulated gruel.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Ayesha a’ Jharra</strong> – The new girl, Ayesha is of an unknown lineage, but has a wealthy uncle for a benefactor. This would be to her advantage, except that she suffers from a belief that she will burst into flames if she loses control of herself, and so she is often sedated, and kept away from things that might burn.</i></p>
<p><i>Chafing under the rule of their headmistress, Miss Hench, they long for the chance to get away on holiday, like the other girls. They get their chance one night when airship pirates raid the school, and rather than be kidnapped by the menacing Captain Blackstone, the girls manage to steal a ship themselves and fly away.</i></p>
<p><i>With their own ship, Rebecca tells them they could escape Wentworth forever and become pirates themselves. But while Wentworth might have prepared them to be young ladies of distinction, it has not taught them to be pirates. They need a teacher, and Diana knows that the famous Captain Hawk has just been captured in London. If they could only break him out of jail, he could teach them everything they might need to know...</i></p>
<p><strong>So What Makes This Story So Great?</strong></p>

<li>Five girls on the run, becoming friends – and more than friends – as they discover who they are and what they can do with their powers!</li>
<li>Action! This is a story about airship pirates, after all. I guarantee swordfights, gunfights, super-powers, and all manner of diversions.</li>
<li><p>Sex! Sex of all kinds! I have not written any porn for almost a year and I am psyched to get back at it.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been excited about this story ever since I thought it up. I love sky pirates, and whenever I see English Boarding School drama I always wish some pirates would come and shake things up. Now they will!</p></li>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","The Pitch...
In the Midlands of England stands the Wentworth Academy for Young Ladies of Distinction, a respected establishment for the schooling of wealthy young women. Yet it has another, secret side. Separate from the main school is the Bloodgood House – a place where girls with “special” requirements are housed. Now, as spring deepens into summer in 1875, there are five girls in residence:
Diana Silverthorn – Bookish, shy Diana has an addiction to penny dreadful tales of airship pirates and swashbuckling adventure – especially the stories of the fearsome Captain Hawk — and spends her time writing torrid pirate adventures she never lets anyone see. It is an unusual pursuit for a young woman, yet not as unusual as the heavy bracelets she must wear to control her magnetic affliction, which can cause every metallic object in a room to be attracted to her.
Rebecca Baltimore – An American girl of a new-money family, Rebecca has been sent to the Academy to try and educate her in spite of her forceful and wayward nature. Rebecca is athletic, adventurous, and very, very strong — so strong she is given a special drink every day at bedtime to make her weak and docile.
Vittra Valdenheld – A quick, intelligent girl with an inquisitive mind and a fierce sense of loyalty, Vittra is very fond of animals of all kinds – especially dangerous ones. She is not allowed any meat, and is given an injection whenever she becomes agitated.
Echo Killwinter – A pale, distracted girl who sings, stays up late, and covets fancy clothes, Echo might seem the least odd of the group. And yet she cannot abide the sunlight, and is allowed to eat only a specially-formulated gruel.
Ayesha a’ Jharra – The new girl, Ayesha is of an unknown lineage, but has a wealthy uncle for a benefactor. This would be to her advantage, except that she suffers from a belief that she will burst into flames if she loses control of herself, and so she is often sedated, and kept away from things that might burn.
Chafing under the rule of their headmistress, Miss Hench, they long for the chance to get away on holiday, like the other girls. They get their chance one night when airship pirates raid the school, and rather than be kidnapped by the menacing Captain Blackstone, the girls manage to steal a ship themselves and fly away.
With their own ship, Rebecca tells them they could escape Wentworth forever and become pirates themselves. But while Wentworth might have prepared them to be young ladies of distinction, it has not taught them to be pirates. They need a teacher, and Diana knows that the famous Captain Hawk has just been captured in London. If they could only break him out of jail, he could teach them everything they might need to know...
So What Makes This Story So Great?

A rollicking steampunk Airship Adventure with five female leads!
Five girls on the run, becoming friends – and more than friends – as they discover who they are and what they can do with their powers!
Action! This is a story about airship pirates, after all. I guarantee swordfights, gunfights, super-powers, and all manner of diversions.
Sex! Sex of all kinds! I have not written any porn for almost a year and I am psyched to get back at it.
I have been excited about this story ever since I thought it up. I love sky pirates, and whenever I see English Boarding School drama I always wish some pirates would come and shake things up. Now they will!


What I Need & What You Get

Funds go to pay my rent, bills, etc.  This is it, this is my livelihood.  I don't have a day job, so this is what I do.
All perks are fulfilled by me, by hand.  You will get to see the book written almost in real time, as it posts on www.adventurotica.com chapter by chapter.  Once it is done, the ebook will follow almost immediately, and then the print book.
Even if I don't reach goal, everyone gets what they paid for, no matter what.


The Impact
Here's where I'm supposed to talk about how this project is important to the world.  Which probably seems silly, only I think this project - and others like it - are very important.  This is the cutting edge of the publishing business, and here I am trying to prove by example that a writer can make a living at what they want to do.  And I don't mean be one of the one-in-a-million longshots we all read about.  I mean being able to be good at what I do and with that carve out a career that can support my modest life.

Here I am dismantling the gatekeepers and the idea of the arts as a lottery.
I have run 16 campaigns to success before this one.
You help keep me alive, and I entertain you.  That's what I do here.

</p><p>
</p><p>Jeremy Johnson’s passion became evident at the early age of two when he stood behind a ceramic owl statue
and pretended to preach in his relatives’ living room. At nine, he accepted Christ as his personal Savior and by
17 sought out opportunities to lead worship and speak in various services throughout the southeast, where he
was raised. To this day, his creativity encourages people who are far from the truth to learn about and know
God‘s grace is sufficient for them. He develops leaders by inspiring them to pursue their callings and has a deep
desire to see and be involved with successful church planting.
</p>
<p>His personal ministry started in 2000 when he served as pastor of students and college ministries – seeing a
growth in weekly attendance from 12 to 75 students. In 2001, he established his own evangelical organization,
J2 Ministries travelling throughout the country impacting thousands for Christ. 2007 was the year God directed
Jeremy Johnson to invest in community and build relationships starting as an Associate Pastor at the local
church level and then as Founder and Lead Pastor for a new church plant in Orlando, Florida. Similar to the
preaching he did at two, Element church’s humble beginnings were in a living room, but grew from six
dedicated believers to a congregation of 140 regular worshipers in the span of a year.
</p>
<p>Father of two beautiful children, Jeremy’s world was turned upside down when his wife of 13 years left him in
late 2012 and four months later filed for divorce. Though there was no moral failure involved, Jeremy was
confronted with the reality of his focus and readily harnessed the blame for his failed marriage. Through God’s
miraculous grace and mercy the months following became a time of incredible spiritual growth. Jeremy
garnered the support of a new community including two counselors proficient in the process of healing
pastors, a team of 80+ prayer warriors and six men who are his personal board of Directors that have kept him
accountable and encouraged. </p>
<p>Jeremy wrote his first book, which is based on his journey of restoration. His passion to be the leader God
has created him to be continues through the healing of scars and the connecting with those who are far from
God on a deep level. The scripture that has been his anchor of hope is Galatians 6:9. Let us not grow weary of
doing good, for in due time the harvest will come – if we refuse to give up. </p><p></p><p></p></div>","Project OverviewMy Name is Jeremy Johnson and I am the author of the upcoming book, Unbroken- ""Discovering Wholeness through the Shattered Pieces of Life"".  This book will be my first book and I am very excited that you have the chance to partner with me to give people the message of hope. The reason I wrote this book was to share my story with transparency.

</h4><p></p><p></p></div>","Hi there! I'm Sean Widup, a senior graphic designer based out of Los Angeles, California. Since
 I was 14 years old, my life has been consumed with art & design. I 
got a used beat up PC and a copy of Photoshop 6.0, and I was 
lost in my new obsession. I'd stay up all night learning from online tutorials and teaching myself from the ground up. Later on in high school I began working with friends and small businesses in my community producing designs in my spare time. I landed a small gig working for a local band designing t-shirts for an upcoming tour they were planning and instantly fell in love with my new job.When
 I was 18 years old I went to a local concert and, for the first time in
 my life, I was able to point out shirts I had designed and say ""I made 
that!"" 10 years later, I've worked with over 300+ bands/record labels/clothing brands, opened my own online store, and worked for countless local and main stage acts. Through my hands on experiences, I've acquired the necessary knowledge and tools to help mold young graphic designers into experienced veterans with a solid work portfolio. After 13+ years, I'm still obsessed, still eager to learn something that I didn't know yesterday. I
 believe in the knowledge I've acquired- if transferred onto paper, it 
would serve as a go-to guide for young designers who want to go venture 
out on their own and freelance for a living. I
 Made That will cover it all. From creating original concepts to 
marketing your portfolio to the masses, this book will be an 
all-inclusive how-to guide complete with tutorials, tips, tricks, do's, 
don'ts and everything else in between.Some of the subjects that will be featured in I Made That include...

Harnessing your style

Managing your portfolio
Developing a system
Workflow
Managing clients
Critical thinking
Contracts
Designing for print
Brand identity
Knowing your ability
Product research
Targeting your audience
Creating a web presence
Marketing to potential clients
Screen printing
Social networking
Portfolio examples
Interviews with designers
  Plain and simple, I can't do it alone! I've
 spent over 10 dedicated years accumulating knowledge and building 
experience, but unfortunately haven't found myself in a position to save
 towards this project. It's scary, terrifying actually. I've talked about it for several years and never got it off the ground.Finally, I'm at a point in my career where I can say with confidence that I'm ready to take on this task and make my dream a reality! The funds raised on Indiegogo will allow me to complete, print and 
publish I Made That  into a full color/hardcover 8x10 book that can be enjoyed by everyone. With your help I can accomplish this! Throughout
 my career, I've networked with some of the brightest and most versatile
 designers in the industry. Over the next six months, I'll conduct 
interviews with them as well as compile their portfolio pieces, covering
 graphic art designs across our worldwide music community. In this 
process, I hope to reflect multiple perspectives on how they approach a 
project, maintain a steady client base, and market themselves to the 
rest of the world.I estimate it will take me 6 months to complete I Made That with an expected shipping date of January 6, 2015.  I know not everyone can donate, but you can help me in other ways! Please repost and share with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and whatever else you can. 
 Together we can make this project a reality, inspiring new artists to

know is that I’m an Australian Author and have been self-publishing titles on
amazon since 2011.  My first non fiction
title “Pro Resumes Made Easy” has been downloaded and/or purchased more than
40,000 times.  I followed this up with
another title “Government Job Apps Made Easy”<br/></span></p>
</div><p></p>
<p>Around a year ago I started thinking about writing
fiction.  </p>
<p>Last year I wrote a piece for my son, Uprising, part of a
series we called Camo Hunters.  I
uploaded it to amazon and sold a couple of them but didn’t really put the time
into promoting this that I had with my non fiction titles.  Why?  Well
in retrospect now I’m glad I didn’t – the writing makes me cringe.</p>
<p>At the time of course I thought the writing was great.  I continued and wrote a couple of short stories,
and a memoir which I may also publish in the future. 
Then in February this year, I met up with a friend and we formed our own
writers group, we met each week.  One
week we got talking about story ideas, and I started talking about my fascination
with psychic powers and the ability to talk to others without speaking.  From there, an idea came to me, what would a
person do if they interrupted a murder, were attacked and left for dead. How
would they report what they knew?  Would
anyone believe them?</p>
<p>From here I started writing what I thought was a short
story.  64,000 words later I had my first
thriller suspense novel, Gyspy Hunted. 
It is currently in the editing phase.  Here is the book trailer: <br/></p><div>

</div><div><b>EXCERPT</b></div>Below is an excerpt from Gypsy Hunted;<br/><p></p><p>As I looked down the quiet
residential street, lit softly by street lamps, I heard the rustling of wind in
the trees and rattling of a rubbish bin in the dark alley to my left. It wasn’t
bin night, so it must be cats fighting or someone getting rid of some junk. </p>
<p>Wishing I’d remembered my glasses, I
squinted as a commotion rose from further down the black laneway. There was a
large van parked at the end and I could make out a figure loading something
into it. </p>
<p>In that instant, I felt a wave of
energy, something steely hard and terrifying. I could almost see it, like a
sheet of granite leading from the van directly to me. I’d learned the hard way
not to deny my instinct, and so I took a quick detour into the alley. This
wasn’t the first time I’d acted  in a mad
rush of spontaneity There was always the pepper spray in my bag if things got
ugly. Besides, as my Dad would say, no one would ever mug a woman like me;
they’d wait for someone else who was a lot less trouble. I was never sure
whether to take that as a compliment or an insult, but at that moment, I didn’t
give a toss.</p>
<p>As
I cautiously approached I
became aware of the stillness. Not a soul in sight.. As I stood staring at the
bin, wondering what to do next, it burst open with a crash.</p>
<p> I jumped and whimpered as a black shape
streaked across the alleyway. A loud wail followed the cat as it sped off into
the night.  I waited for my heart to stop
pounding in my ears, for my body to stop trembling.  And then, committed now, I continued walking to
the end of the isolated laneway and the van waiting there.</p><p>I blew out a long breath, my legs wobbly on the cobblestones.  Thank god it was just a cat. </p><p>As I walked further along the lane, I saw that what had earlier looked like a couple of rubbish bags lying beside <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">the open van door, was actually a young woman lying on the ground. Long, golden-colored
hair fell across her face, her wrists were tied, and through her mouth, gagged with duct
tape, she was struggling to make some semblance of noise. Her long legs kicked the air like hell. Her eyes were saucers, reflecting with the terror rolling off her in huge swells.  </span></p><p>Something shifted in the blackness.
As I tried to process what it was, it suddenly sprang from behind the van to
offer me an up-close view. He stood so near that his stinking, loud breath
assaulted my senses. He towered over me <span>in a dark hoodie his chest thrust forward, elbows out. In the faint light of the streetlight before the alley, I could
make out sandy hair. Other than that, his face was completely hidden by the hood. His
body carried a strange, unidentifiable smell, acrid and bitter. </span></p><p>I was supposed to be terrified, but
instead I felt shut off from reality, numb. I needed to grab the can of pepper
spray from my bag but I was paralyzed, rooted to the spot. </p><p>“Fuck off, bitch...” he spat as I
grabbed for my bag.</p><p>He seized the girl, shoving her into
the back of the van roughly. I <span>threw myself forward to stop him, but he shoved me back with
more force than I’d anticipated. I rocked back on my heels, hands flailing
wildly, and I just managed to stay upright as he slammed the van door closed. I heard the girl pounding her feet on the inside of the van, pounding loudly.</span></p><p>My pulse was pumping madly, and the
adrenaline had kicked in. I ground my teeth and
jumped at the sound of the engine starting. I ran for the front driver’s window,
which of course he had locked, and started bashing it with my fists, screeching.  </p><p>“Let her go! Let her <i>go</i>, you bastard!” I spoke through
flattened lips, past my neck in which a vein was pulsing and engorged. </p><p>I stood in front of the vehicle,
legs planted wide part and gazed down
at the registration plates. If I could get his registration details, I could report him to the police who would track him down. I reached into my handbag for my mobile phone, realizing I should have done this earlier and made a damn call to the cops. </p><p>He
revved the crap out of
the van, the engine growling so loud I felt it through my toes. But I stood my
ground, even with nails biting into my palms, pulse speeding, and heartbeat
pounding.  I’d get his details through to
the police if it was the last thing I did.</p><p>I looked up to face him and the van
launched at me. I dialed the emergency services number holding the phone to my
ear with fingers so rigid they hurt. The van came at me and in a split second I
I was hit, my body bouncing off the van.  My head taking the brunt of the blow as I
struck the brick wall, landing on the ground like a rag doll unloved and
discarded.  Strangely, nothing hurt, at
least at this moment. I was sure that it should.  </p><p>Colors flashed: green, hot pink, and
yellow.  Tires squealed, and I thought I
heard frantic footsteps approaching.</p><p>Then it was lights out. </p><p>

I'm a playwright, screenwriter, poet and teacher who was recognized by Seattle's The Stranger as a recipient of their annual Genius Award and, most recently, by the Frye Art Museum as part of their spotlight on Seattle artists. I'm a lucky guy. My plays have flourished in productions across
 the U.S., exploring subjects ranging from personal nuclear catastrophe 
to the uncelebrated underbelly of American History. My blog Just Wrought has all my work, if you'd like to learn more.Today, I'm reaching out to the world in order to to help fund publication of my latest work, a memoir, The Starting Gate.
What's The Starting Gate About?The Starting Gate is a smooth cocktail consisting of thirteen
interconnected chapters, tracking my life from my first job
as a stock boy at a Maryland country bar (called the Starting Gate) where my boss once shot a man dead for trying to rob the local drug store, to 
my
days as the only white kid on an all-black labor crew at the National 
Archives. You'll learn what it's like to spend days cleaning the high-rise glass windows of Manhattan and the rules you 
need to know to enjoy a cocktail with the greatest living bartender, 
Murray Stenson.The Plan
I'll publish The Starting Gate across three channels:•  Hardcover•  Electronic •  AudioAnd, I’m almost there... I
just need your help in the form of a contribution. With it we can make The Starting Gate a success.Use of Funds

•  copy editor•  book designer•  printing cost (500 high quality hard bound)•  recording, editing and mastering the
audio version•  setting up an electronic version for
easy download•  setting up an easily ordered,
on-demand paperback edition of the book    (available by the end of 2016)

Use of Excess Funds

•  Marketing the book to a wider audience•  A second printing of the
hardcover edition•  Underwriting a modest book tour to key
cities throughout the country to where my plays have been staged and I think
I can stir up a market for the book.
In exchange for your
support, I promise I won’t leave you empty handed. In addition to my eternal
gratitude, and depending on your level of support, you will receive one or more
of many perks, such as:
• The first-edition
hardback edition of the book.• The audio
version of the book, read by yours truly.• An
electronic copy of the book easily downloadable to your Kindle   or other
e-reader• A visit
to a venue of your choosing for a public reading   of any chapter by the author,
a.k.a. yours truly

<p>After thirty years raising three children and teaching children ages three through thirty, I am taking a year-long sabbatical (a sort of gap year) to write my first novel.<br/></p>
<p>I have been writing poetry, short fiction, and nonfiction for many years, but I have wanted for a long time to write a book to celebrate the beauty of life on planet Earth and its role in shaping the human experience.<br/></p>
<p>This novel, which has a science fiction premise but a very realistic plot, will take us across the landscape of four regions of the American West, through four seasons, and through natural and human history, as it explores our relationship with the planet that gave us life but is struggling to sustain us now.<br/></p>

Get Results.</h3> <p>For the past decade or so, I've dedicated my life to helping people just like you to get clear. (Now I'm asking for your help in bringing clearing to the world!) ""Get clear"" means two things: </p> <ul>
<li>
<b>CLARITY. </b>What's what now, what really happened in the past, what you want, and what's the quickest way to get there. Sounds simple, but if you stop to think for a moment, can you think of at least one area of your life where you are uncertain? Yup, that's the part that could benefit from a heaping dose of clarity, like ASAP. </li> <li>
<b>CLEARING.</b> As a master intuitive healer, I help you clear your crap, swiftly and permanently releasing the doubts, blocks, fears, and/or limiting beliefs that have kept you stuck.  When you get clear, you get results. Cue the heavens opening up and the ""ahhhhhhhh"" chorus. </li>
</ul>When you get CLEAR, then you get lasting results. Otherwise, it's all just a temporary fix. I've helped tens of thousands of people to get clear, and made a healthy living doing it (I don't mind tellin' ya.) Now it's time to give back and share with the world these same powerful tools and secrets that have helped my students and private clients to completely transform their lives, all by clearing the crap that was in their way. </div><div>Hmmmm…what's the best/fastest way for me to share this prized training with as many people as possible? Publish a DIY clearing book and get it into lots of hands.  </div> <div> <h3>You Want In?</h3> <p>I'm already a 2x bestselling author, so this ain't my first rodeo. (Translation: rest assured I'm a good writer and I know how to create and market a great book. Word.) But instead of just publishing this book myself, I figured it would be a lot more fun to build a community and share the rewards together. Besides, a like-minded community is exactly what you're gonna want as soon as you start messing around with these clearing tools (because it helps to have somebody to practice on. And I'm not sure how your boss or your neighbor would feel about past life clearings, or pendulums, or any of the other weird-yet-wildly-effective stuff we're going to play with together, so it helps to meet new people and start fresh, mmmkay?).   </p> <ul>
<li>I'm asking you to help chip in for the <b>exact</b> amount it will cost me to produce this book and bring it to the masses. Funds raised are to cover the costs of a professional copyeditor, proofreader, cover designer, interior layout designer, printing and publishing, distribution, ISBN #s, website, and promotion.   </li> <li>You'll find some pretty snazzy perks here, including three brand-new, never-before-seen offerings from me, like a brand new top-secret Facebook mastermind community - which ALL contributors get access to. (So excited!!!!) Just to put things into perspective, it costs about $5000 to work with me personally. More than half of the perks packages include some type of one-on-one time with me.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Clearing</h3> <p>Want peace? Joy? Love? Acceptance? Prosperity? Achievement? Work on getting CLEAR, because it's your ticket to everything you want (assuming you know what you want. Which, if you don't, that kind of proves my point, doesn't it?) </p> <ul>
<li>As a planet, we are approaching a tipping point. The more people who get clear, the more peace we will experience as a global community. I don't like to throw around phrases like ""peace"" and ""global community"" because it has sort of a hippie-dippy feel to it, but you know that scene at the end of ""Miss Congeniality"" where Sandra Bullock is back to being an FBI agent, but now she's all gorgeous, and she gets the award from her fellow pageanters, and she suddenly gets choked up and says, ""Ohmigod. I really DO want world peace!"" Yeah, it's like that. </li> <li>Not everyone can afford to work with me directly or to take my courses, and I've been providing free and low-cost alternatives in one form or another since I got started, but nothing as comprehensive and step-by-step as this book. This book WILL make a difference in the lives of the people who read it. It's important, and your support is important to me, more than you could know. *end sentimental moment*</li> <li>People know me as a leader and teacher who underpromises and over delivers.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges. Say What?</h3> <p>Yes, everything in life has a risk, especially anything worth doing (I am OK with risk! I logged over 300 scuba dives before I had kids. Um, and about 4 since.)</p> <ul>
<li>Every participation level includes a copy of the book in one form or another. Your risk is that you could think the book sucks. In which case, we should probably clear some crap for you, hahahahaha. No, seriously. You might hate it, hate me, or just think it's all way too ""out there"" for you. That's a risk. Although if you've read this far, I'd say it's unlikely. If you were going to hate me, you'd have decided that before you even finished my video above. So that's a pretty low risk. </li> <li>There's virtually no risk that I won't finish the book because I love to write, I'm already working on it and I thrive on deadlines. I'm just weird like that. </li>
<li>There is also a risk that you could buy one of the top perks packages, enter  your payment info, and then immediately get struck dead by lightning. However, as a skilled psychic I will tell you that is highly unlikely. IF you contribute today.</li> </ul>

<h3>Everything you need to know about being bi in the UK</h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Purple Prose: Bisexuality in Britain</i> is just what it says on the tin: an accessible guide to UK bisexuality. It covers topics such as definitions of bisexuality (and why the dictionary definition isn't good enough), stereotypes and biphobia (including prejudice from within the gay and lesbian communities, sadly), being bi at work, teenage bisexuality and bisexuality through the years, the media’s approach to bisexual celebrities, and fictional bi characters.</p>
<p>We explore the various ways bisexuality intersects with other identities: disabled bisexuals, polyamorous bisexuals, trans and genderqueer bisexuals and bis of colour have all written about their experiences. There's a ""problem page"" chapter, a chapter on bi history, a chapter on activism and local bi groups, a glossary, an index, and a list of online resources. This is the book you’ll buy for your friend who’s just come out to you as bi-curious, or for your parents who think your bisexuality is weird or a phase, or for yourself, because you know you’re bi but you don’t know where to go or what to do about it.</p>

Paperback and e-book copies of my novel, <a href=""http://amzn.to/1GhAK0n"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>All Lies and Jest.</i></a> A dark, sexy subculture romp, <i>All Lies and Jest</i> is a novel about belief, delusion, and the dangers of being so open-minded that your brain falls out. When the USA becomes a fundamentalist theocracy, one of its first actions is to round up all the queers, atheists, deviants, geeks, goths and other undesirables it can find, and throw them out. The UK welcomes more than its fair share. But Britain is no haven; the Christian United States wants the Old Country to follow in its footsteps, and the fundamentalist tides are rising. Elinor Rosewood is a habitual non-conformist. As British as tea and spanking, she flees her small-minded home town for the dubious joys of London. It’s only after she arrives that she discovers that the greatest isolation can come from being in the middle of a crowd of strangers.</p>

Everything you need to know about being bi in the UK

Purple Prose: Bisexuality in Britain is just what it says on the tin: an accessible guide to UK bisexuality. It covers topics such as definitions of bisexuality (and why the dictionary definition isn't good enough), stereotypes and biphobia (including prejudice from within the gay and lesbian communities, sadly), being bi at work, teenage bisexuality and bisexuality through the years, the media’s approach to bisexual celebrities, and fictional bi characters.
We explore the various ways bisexuality intersects with other identities: disabled bisexuals, polyamorous bisexuals, trans and genderqueer bisexuals and bis of colour have all written about their experiences. There's a ""problem page"" chapter, a chapter on bi history, a chapter on activism and local bi groups, a glossary, an index, and a list of online resources. This is the book you’ll buy for your friend who’s just come out to you as bi-curious, or for your parents who think your bisexuality is weird or a phase, or for yourself, because you know you’re bi but you don’t know where to go or what to do about it.

A dark, sexy subculture romp, All Lies and Jest is a novel about belief, delusion, and the dangers of being so open-minded that your brain falls out. When the USA becomes a fundamentalist theocracy, one of its first actions is to round up all the queers, atheists, deviants, geeks, goths and other undesirables it can find, and throw them out. The UK welcomes more than its fair share. But Britain is no haven; the Christian United States wants the Old Country to follow in its footsteps, and the fundamentalist tides are rising. Elinor Rosewood is a habitual non-conformist. As British as tea and spanking, she flees her small-minded home town for the dubious joys of London. It’s only after she arrives that she discovers that the greatest isolation can come from being in the middle of a crowd of strangers.

I love everything about the Indie culture. I wanted an online magazine platform that could, showcase Indie works of art from all over the world. All the things I loved. Books, etsy, crafters, Music, Photography, Poetry, Life style living.

<h3>La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est quoi?</h3>
<p>La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est avant tout un projet de brasseurs. Nous avons pour mission de faire rayonner la bière artisanale dans la région et à l'échelle du Québec. Il n'y aura pas de compromis sur l'utilisation d'ingrédients et la qualité du produit, nous voulons simplement vous servir le meilleur.</p>
<p>La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est un lieu pour tous les amateurs de bières, néophytes, <i>beergeeks</i> ou touristes. Non seulement nous avons la volonté de brasser la meilleure bière possible, mais nous voulons aussi être un endroit de rencontres et de partage. Nous allons brasser des bières collaboratives avec d'autres microbrasseries. Nous voulons encourager aussi le développement du brassage amateur, notamment par l'organisation de concours et d'ateliers sur le brassage.</p>
<p>La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est aussi l'appropriation du territoire. Combien de fois a-t-on entendu qu'il n'y avait rien du côté de Gatineau? Notre projet s'inscrit dans la logique de développer une appartenance régionale. Nos racines sont ici. Nous voulons multiplier les liens dans notre communauté, travailler avec des entreprises et des projets de la région et prouver que nous ne sommes pas une simple banlieue d'Ottawa.</p>
<h3>La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, les origines</h3>
<p>Le projet de la Brasserie du Bas-Canada s'est façonné au fil de dégustations de bières, de sessions de brassage, de milliers d'heures de remue-méninges et de plusieurs périples au Québec, en Ontario, dans l'Ouest canadien et dans le Nord-Est des États-Unis. C'est la rencontre de deux entrepreneurs passionnés de bières et de produits du terroir.</p>
<p>Marc-André Cordeiro Lima est un vétéran du monde de la restauration et des bars avec près de quinze années d'expérience dans le domaine. Également, il a fait un passage chez Labatt et au Gainsbourg. Traducteur de formation, il n'a pas la langue dans sa poche. C'est un brasseur passionné et il aime le contact humain. Vous l'avez sûrement déjà aperçu une bière à la main entrain de convertir les foules aux vertus de la bière artisanale.</p>
<p>Gabriel Girard Bernier est un produit de la restauration et du monde du vin. Sommelier de profession, il a côtoyé, dans sa jeunesse, les fermenteurs de la défunte microbrasserie Brassemonde à St-André-Avellin. Il a travaillé notamment au Gainsbourg et à Soif-Bar à Vin avec Véronique Rivest. Ses aventures dans le monde du vin l'ont amené dans l'Ouest canadien mais surtout au monde de la bière. Brasseur passionné, ce n'est pas le plus bruyant du duo, mais il peut vous parler d'une technique brassicole ou d'une souche de levure pendant des heures.</p>
<h3>Votre contribution sert à quoi?</h3>
<p>En bref, nous voulons 17 500$ pour acheter davantage d'équipements brassicoles, notamment un fermenteur supplémentaire. S'équiper en équipement brassicole, c'est très dispendieux. </p>
<p>Si nous atteignons l'objectif fixé, ce fermenteur supplémentaire que nous avons baptisé <i>Fermenteur du peuple</i> servira à des brassins collaboratifs et des brassins interactifs. C'est-à-dire que nous ne voulons pas seulement acheter de l'équipement grâce à cette campagne de sociofinancement mais aussi créer avec vous un lien unique et durable.</p>
<p>En pratique, ce fermenteur servira à produire au moins deux brassins interactifs annuellement. Le type de bière, les paramètres de la recette et le nom de la bière seront élaborés avec vous via les médias sociaux. Des brassins collaboratifs avec d'autres brasseries, des brasseurs amateurs, et des partenaires régionaux seront aussi produits grâce à votre aide!</p>
<p>Nous vous proposons des contreparties diverses et franchement intéressantes. Elles sont réalistes, originales et vous permettent de mettre la main sur des produits exclusifs. Les dates de livraisons sont basées sur des prévisions pessimistes, ainsi nous voulons garantir que les contreparties seront disponibles dans les délais.</p>
<h3>À quelle étape est rendu le projet de la Brasserie du Bas-Canada?</h3>
<p>-Nous avons sécurisé notre local au 455, boulevard de la Gappe (vous pouvez l'admirer dans la vidéo).</p>
<p>-Une demande pour modifier le zonage a été déposée à la Ville de Gatineau en juillet dernier. Nous avons travaillé avec le comité d'urbanisme et le processus est bien enclenché.</p>
<p>-En juin, nous avons brassé et commercialisé une première bière, La P'tite Wit, qui a été définitivement un succès. Brassée dans les installations de la microbrasserie Loup Rouge à Sorel, notre bière a été disponible dans différents bars et restaurants de la région. D'ailleurs, une nouvelle bière sera disponible sous peu et des bières collaboratives seront produites dans les prochains mois.</p>
<p>-Les plans du local et de la salle de brassage sont prêts.</p>
<p>-Nous avons l'appui d'acteurs économiques importants de la région dont le CLD de Gatineau.</p>
<p>-Nous avons des lettres d'intention d'achats de la part de plusieurs entreprises de la région et d'ailleurs au Québec.</p>
<p>-Le montage financier du projet est en processus de finalisation.</p>
<p>-Nous avons des investisseurs sérieux derrière le projet.</p>

</div></div>","La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est quoi?
La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est avant tout un projet de brasseurs. Nous avons pour mission de faire rayonner la bière artisanale dans la région et à l'échelle du Québec. Il n'y aura pas de compromis sur l'utilisation d'ingrédients et la qualité du produit, nous voulons simplement vous servir le meilleur.
La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est un lieu pour tous les amateurs de bières, néophytes, beergeeks ou touristes. Non seulement nous avons la volonté de brasser la meilleure bière possible, mais nous voulons aussi être un endroit de rencontres et de partage. Nous allons brasser des bières collaboratives avec d'autres microbrasseries. Nous voulons encourager aussi le développement du brassage amateur, notamment par l'organisation de concours et d'ateliers sur le brassage.
La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, c'est aussi l'appropriation du territoire. Combien de fois a-t-on entendu qu'il n'y avait rien du côté de Gatineau? Notre projet s'inscrit dans la logique de développer une appartenance régionale. Nos racines sont ici. Nous voulons multiplier les liens dans notre communauté, travailler avec des entreprises et des projets de la région et prouver que nous ne sommes pas une simple banlieue d'Ottawa.
La Brasserie du Bas-Canada, les origines
Le projet de la Brasserie du Bas-Canada s'est façonné au fil de dégustations de bières, de sessions de brassage, de milliers d'heures de remue-méninges et de plusieurs périples au Québec, en Ontario, dans l'Ouest canadien et dans le Nord-Est des États-Unis. C'est la rencontre de deux entrepreneurs passionnés de bières et de produits du terroir.
Marc-André Cordeiro Lima est un vétéran du monde de la restauration et des bars avec près de quinze années d'expérience dans le domaine. Également, il a fait un passage chez Labatt et au Gainsbourg. Traducteur de formation, il n'a pas la langue dans sa poche. C'est un brasseur passionné et il aime le contact humain. Vous l'avez sûrement déjà aperçu une bière à la main entrain de convertir les foules aux vertus de la bière artisanale.
Gabriel Girard Bernier est un produit de la restauration et du monde du vin. Sommelier de profession, il a côtoyé, dans sa jeunesse, les fermenteurs de la défunte microbrasserie Brassemonde à St-André-Avellin. Il a travaillé notamment au Gainsbourg et à Soif-Bar à Vin avec Véronique Rivest. Ses aventures dans le monde du vin l'ont amené dans l'Ouest canadien mais surtout au monde de la bière. Brasseur passionné, ce n'est pas le plus bruyant du duo, mais il peut vous parler d'une technique brassicole ou d'une souche de levure pendant des heures.
Votre contribution sert à quoi?
En bref, nous voulons 17 500$ pour acheter davantage d'équipements brassicoles, notamment un fermenteur supplémentaire. S'équiper en équipement brassicole, c'est très dispendieux. 
Si nous atteignons l'objectif fixé, ce fermenteur supplémentaire que nous avons baptisé Fermenteur du peuple servira à des brassins collaboratifs et des brassins interactifs. C'est-à-dire que nous ne voulons pas seulement acheter de l'équipement grâce à cette campagne de sociofinancement mais aussi créer avec vous un lien unique et durable.
En pratique, ce fermenteur servira à produire au moins deux brassins interactifs annuellement. Le type de bière, les paramètres de la recette et le nom de la bière seront élaborés avec vous via les médias sociaux. Des brassins collaboratifs avec d'autres brasseries, des brasseurs amateurs, et des partenaires régionaux seront aussi produits grâce à votre aide!
Nous vous proposons des contreparties diverses et franchement intéressantes. Elles sont réalistes, originales et vous permettent de mettre la main sur des produits exclusifs. Les dates de livraisons sont basées sur des prévisions pessimistes, ainsi nous voulons garantir que les contreparties seront disponibles dans les délais.
À quelle étape est rendu le projet de la Brasserie du Bas-Canada?
-Nous avons sécurisé notre local au 455, boulevard de la Gappe (vous pouvez l'admirer dans la vidéo).
-Une demande pour modifier le zonage a été déposée à la Ville de Gatineau en juillet dernier. Nous avons travaillé avec le comité d'urbanisme et le processus est bien enclenché.
-En juin, nous avons brassé et commercialisé une première bière, La P'tite Wit, qui a été définitivement un succès. Brassée dans les installations de la microbrasserie Loup Rouge à Sorel, notre bière a été disponible dans différents bars et restaurants de la région. D'ailleurs, une nouvelle bière sera disponible sous peu et des bières collaboratives seront produites dans les prochains mois.
-Les plans du local et de la salle de brassage sont prêts.
-Nous avons l'appui d'acteurs économiques importants de la région dont le CLD de Gatineau.
-Nous avons des lettres d'intention d'achats de la part de plusieurs entreprises de la région et d'ailleurs au Québec.
-Le montage financier du projet est en processus de finalisation.
-Nous avons des investisseurs sérieux derrière le projet.
Bref, il reste encore beaucoup de travail à faire, mais nous sommes près du but.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the book </h3>
<p>Boring Donkey songs is a collection of poems and writings by Singapore Cultural Medallion recipient and winner of the Joseph Balestier Award for the Freedom of Art 2016, Lee Wen.</p>
<p>While not considering himself a writer by profession, Lee Wen updates his Facebook page daily with his thoughts and feelings on occurrences around him, be it his individual political philosophies or his own struggles with Parkinson’s disease. The book also provides crucial records and accounts of Singaporean art history. Lee frequently alludes to vital, unforgettable moments in our short history, such as the controversial 10-year ban of performance art and forum theatre, artists and professionals who have left an indelible mark on our artistic developments such as Josef Ng, Helina Chan and Juliana Yasin, and recounts of his own struggles experienced as an artist in Singapore. Donkey Songs therefore serves as a record of his frustrations and triumphs portrayed in an almost anti-poem sense, where his writings emulate the sense of a poem, but without its traditional elements.  Chapters are divided by year starting from 2013, and are organised in chronological sequence by month and date of material.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Through this crowdfunding initiative, we hope to raise enough money to cover the publishing costs of printing Donkey Songs. The rest of the proceeds will go towards Lee Wen’s medical expenses and assisted care as he continues to tackle Parkinson’s disease.

This will be done by conducting interviews with as many people as possible who are directly involved in these types of projects as possible. Not just the administrators and coaches either, but the African people will be actively sought out to discuss their feelings.</p>
<p>I have already begun work on this project while still here in North America, this is being collected on <a href=""http://soccerandsocietaldevelopment.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my blog</a> as I continue to work.

<p><strong>1)</strong> I will conduct interviews with volunteers in Africa teaching children, and adults in need, soccer through such organizations as: <a href=""http://www.projects-abroad.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Projects Abroad</a>, <a href=""http://www.volunteerhq.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Volunteer HQ</a>, <a href=""http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grassroot Soccer</a>, <a href=""http://www.crossculturalsolutions.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cross Cultural Solutions</a>, <a href=""http://www.africanimpact.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African Impact</a>, and a number of others. This will be an opportunity to have a series of articles that show how we, ordinary citizens of the world, can positively affect the world around us.<br/><br/><strong>2)</strong> I will examine how a local African soccer league operates its own charitable projects. I have chosen <a href=""http://www.psl.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Premier Soccer League</a> (PSL) as my focus. I will foucs on Ajax Cape Town’s <a href=""http://www.ajaxct.com/community.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Scheme</a>, where players and coaches participate with children in their area. I wish to see how these groups interact twith the same grassroots organzations that are not part of a charitable organization.<br/><br/><strong>3)</strong> The last phase will incorporate the <a href=""http://www.cafonline.com/competition/orange-can-2013_2013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Cup of Nations</a>, which will be held in South Africa January 19 - February 10 2013. This will be a great opportunity to show what the pinnacle of soccer in Africa can do for its people. The purpose of this phase will be to link together everything from the children learning soccer in the playground, to the professional clubs interacting with those same children, to the international stars representing their country. I wish to show the connection from dusty African playgrounds staffed by volunteers, to the premier stadiums of World soccer.<br/><br/>I have developed a number of contacts across North America and Africa who are itching to get in on this project once it is fully realized. You too can be part of it, by contributing you are getting me closer to being in Africa to conduct this reasearch and write this book.

<b>My background</b>: I’m a graduate of life sciences who crossed over
into the domain of psychology, psychiatry and social work - assisting substance
misusers, young people, mental health survivors and refugees for 8 years (where
this project began).<span>  Later I switched
to IT and Web site management as a day job whilst continuing to develop work on
a thesis whenever possible. Currently promoting online the biodiversity of wild
bee species.<br/><br/></span>
<div align=""justify"">
<b>My Campaign</b>: I would like to fund the final
      stages of an important work that accounts for, amongst other things, how relationships between
      neurones in the brain manifest the units or expressed elements of
      psychology (knowledge, understanding, behaviour, language, consciousness,
      faith, purpose, meaning etc.).<br/><br/><b>To note (before reading the rest of my presentation)</b>: the account below presents the logical process showing that it is rooted in established science (not simply a work of imagination or fiction) plucked out of thin air. The book will be written in a simple step-by-step argued style, so that anyone who has studied the basics of biology at school will be able to follow.  <br/><br/><b>The work's logic</b> has been achieved by
      exploring, mapping and formulating the <i>information organisation</i>
      pattern omnipresent in biology - the Gene - and comparing it with the
      organisational pattern of information at the human brain level (the unit
      of Understanding).  Having done
      so, over 20 similarities between the two domains of expression emerge, as
      if the two systems are analogous. I have called this <b>information
      organisation pattern, the <i>Appreciative State</i></b>, where essentially
      environmental information is rationally represented and matched with
      internal structures to create a response capacity. The <i>Appreciative
      State</i> appears to be the biological version of a physical property, but
      is one that provides a counter response to the forces of entropy, however
      enabling life not only to act to protect itself, but to react to it
      through expression and thrive in its given environment.

<br/><br/><i>Could the human brain really be using the same Appreciative
State information organisation pattern as the cell? </i>Amongst the 20
similarities, is that the brain focuses through time on a survival horizon; it
expresses itself to thrive in, and dominate its respective environment; it is
characterised by what it appreciates and amongst other things is not beyond
being cultured.<span> So it’s not implausible
that evolution hit upon the same fundamental outside-inside organisation as the cell. It is
also curious that we use the word ‘expression’ to talk about the outcomes of
both genetic and human brain activity.  </span><br/><br/>The evolution of this capacity to
      generate Appreciative States in our brains, <i>in quantity</i>, could thus have
      been the key event that gave us our evolutionary advantage – the missing
      link that anthropologists have been searching for. <br/><br/>When we look at
      the detail and formulate the constants of shared Appreciative State
      construction (between the Gene/cell and Understanding/brain)  - constants which are ‘fulfilled’ by variables of the level -
      we also start to see an organisational resonance at other levels; with
      other <i>internal-external </i>systems: in physiology, in social identity, in
      technology, in institutions, in law and policy, to nation states and
      higher. In that resonance, we also can see that failure to attain or
      maintain higher Appreciative States can result in collapses and ensuing
      power struggles between the higher and lower respective levels. The most prominent examples of this are
      disease, mental illness, social oppression, revolution and international
      conflicts. <br/><br/>As a form of supportive evidence
      for the existence of Appreciative States (and our prior ignorance of
      them), we find ourselves observing a sort of domino effect.  With solutions
      to a significant number of debates tumbling in sequence. This constitutes a form of proof for the work and its core idea. This, plus the realisation that we can
      now see a <i>substructure or pattern </i>to human expression with the potential to put in order (realign) a number
      human domains that don't function correctly (see list), enables us to pull together the pieces of the
      historically difficult human nature and activity puzzle. <b>The Appreciate
      State provides us with a common framework or surface upon which we can
      reliably compare and fit together domain edges, effectively giving us
      a bigger picture and a unifying theory of human expression</b>. 

<br/><br/>The parts of the puzzle that the full work will impact
on - either directly seen, implied by debates or even <i>political correctness</i> - are
as follows<span>: </span><br/><ul>
<li>The <b>neural correlates of consciousness</b> (a mechanism);</li>
<li>A theory of Intelligence (and AI);</li>

With all its promise, the work needs to be out in the public domain and examined. So my campaign is to get assistance to finalise this important work and publish it as a book.<br/>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>The magnitude of what contributors will help
achieve</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>As the implications of the work are
      simply enormous</b>, since the start of the project 21 years ago I have
      always believed that there are hundreds or thousands of people whose
      paths I haven’t been able to cross and engage with,
      but who know precisely the importance it holds at the heart of it.  People that would readily offer
      support to the project (or person behind it); professionals or
      individuals who would benefit in their lives, and conscious, concerned citizens who want our
      political systems to have real rational policy integrity. An integrity that would abstract us,
      and function independently from the ideologies and political personality. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you are one of
      those people, you probably know that since the Renaissance period, it has
      been the aim of leading thinkers to bring together a coherent description
      of the relationship between the arts, sciences and humanities; to
      comprehend how social justice can be an integral part of political and
      rational economic aims. This
      relationship has however eluded us; and remained mysteriously hidden out
      of sight but continued to be a grail of for many wider-thinking academics.  If you are one of these people,
      this work is for you. Please help me with the means to achieve the final phase
      of the work, so I can then
      bring together the ends. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>On a personal note</b>, enabling
      me to finish the work will set me free on so many levels. The ‘Eureka
      moment’ occurred in May of 1993 when I was in my early twenties. Bitten
      by something terrifyingly huge that I could not at all ignore or escape
      from, I knew it would take time, but couldn’t foresee how many times on
      my path I would put career possibilities, ambitions of having a family
      and material gains aside. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I had hoped with each funding
      application or letter to people that could help with it (see attempts
      list below), something would give. Now in my mid-forties, 21 years on, I
      believe I have to stick my neck out, be more visible and ask for your
      indulgence. Crowd-source funding is the perfect and final opportunity to
      accomplish my aims.

<br/></p>
<h3>What is Needed <br/>
</h3>I need uninterrupted time to finish
      the work; to cover basic living expenses for 6 months. The period will
      allow me to distil around 160,000 words that I have at present down to a
      draft that I can get a professional editor to work on in the end/spring
      of 2015.  I work with wild
      solitary bee populations (especially the culture of mason bees), so when
      my first draft is being examined spring activities will step in to
      provide me with living expenses for the final editing phase. I aim to
      have an e-book ready for distribution to my Indiegogo supporters and
      interested parties in May 2015 – the 22<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the
      discovery.

<br/><br/><b>The advantages of helping me</b>: at risk of sounding pompous, any sharers or supporter of this project will be
able to say that they were part of a key moment; being present to assist the
birth of this very important work. Those that contribute the sum whose perk
covers the e-book will get the inside track to a probable shift in the way we
regard human activity. It is entirely possible, though there is no guarantee,
that being the first among your family, friends and colleagues to clearly
comprehend this, could bring personal and professional advantages.<br/><br/><b>Where the funds will go if I don't reach my goal</b>: All funds will contribute to
      finishing the work and the e-books will be delivered to contributors
      whether on deadline or just after. A Twitter account (<a href=""https://twitter.com/AStateBook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@<span>AStateBook</span></a>) is also set up to

</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>The Impact</h3>You may believe or think my
      game-changing claims are impossible, but also want to be proven wrong.
      Know that - like all big ideas - there will be an inherent simplicity and
      beauty in what I am about to publish and you will certainly see this when you read the chapter dealing with Political level phenomena, even if at this point it is not
      that evident. Your contribution whether buying an ebook or telling your
      friends or colleagues to ‘<i>check out this project where this bloke is
      making a massive set of claims on Indiegogo</i>’, will be very much
      appreciated.

<br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Let me first state that I have not had one single
      contradiction to the core <i>Appreciative State</i> thesis on all the years I have been working on it. I have constantly rechecked my
      assumptions, worked and compared it in the real world for alignment with
      surface behaviour and language, and constant confirmation reassures me of
      its accuracy and inherent beauty.<b><br/><br/></b><ol>
<li>
<b>I may be overwhelmed by the
      scale of the task</b>: Conscious of the enormity of the work, on a
      handful occasions I have been overwhelmed by what I often referred to
      ‘the hot and hairy monster’.  Too
      hot to get close to and too hairy (read scary) to contemplate.  I have taken unconscious breaks from
      the work usually because of such fears. However I am tenacious, if
      nothing else, and have kept coming back to it. There’s also been
      sometimes the ‘Who am I to be in possession of such a hugely important
      piece of work?’ question, but I am reminded that I made a relatively rare
      move from life sciences to the psychological and social arenas and that
      this cross-domain perspective, combined with my courage to pose some
      fundamental questions is what has gifted me this precious revelation.
      Support from a large number of people might initially also overwhelm me,
      but this positive experience would rapidly serve to bolster my
      concentrating and courage.</li>
<li>
<b>Someone will ‘publish’ before I
      do</b>. This is a risk I have to take, but I have been living with this for years.  I have a long history of notes, documents
      and letters that show my involvement in the inception, history and
      vision. I just have to trust in providence and people’s decency to give
      me credit where it is due.

</ol>
</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>Past Challenges</h3>

important to people you know (perhaps working to assist those in difficulty), <b>please
share the page on your timelines </b>or by pasting the page link in your emails. Thank you.<br/>
</div> <p>There are buttons below that will make this
process easier. <br/></p></div>","My background: I’m a graduate of life sciences who crossed over
into the domain of psychology, psychiatry and social work - assisting substance
misusers, young people, mental health survivors and refugees for 8 years (where
this project began).  Later I switched
to IT and Web site management as a day job whilst continuing to develop work on
a thesis whenever possible. Currently promoting online the biodiversity of wild
bee species.

My Campaign: I would like to fund the final
      stages of an important work that accounts for, amongst other things, how relationships between
      neurones in the brain manifest the units or expressed elements of
      psychology (knowledge, understanding, behaviour, language, consciousness,
      faith, purpose, meaning etc.).To note (before reading the rest of my presentation): the account below presents the logical process showing that it is rooted in established science (not simply a work of imagination or fiction) plucked out of thin air. The book will be written in a simple step-by-step argued style, so that anyone who has studied the basics of biology at school will be able to follow.  The work's logic has been achieved by
      exploring, mapping and formulating the information organisation
      pattern omnipresent in biology - the Gene - and comparing it with the
      organisational pattern of information at the human brain level (the unit
      of Understanding).  Having done
      so, over 20 similarities between the two domains of expression emerge, as
      if the two systems are analogous. I have called this information
      organisation pattern, the Appreciative State, where essentially
      environmental information is rationally represented and matched with
      internal structures to create a response capacity. The Appreciative
      State appears to be the biological version of a physical property, but
      is one that provides a counter response to the forces of entropy, however
      enabling life not only to act to protect itself, but to react to it
      through expression and thrive in its given environment.

Could the human brain really be using the same Appreciative
State information organisation pattern as the cell? Amongst the 20
similarities, is that the brain focuses through time on a survival horizon; it
expresses itself to thrive in, and dominate its respective environment; it is
characterised by what it appreciates and amongst other things is not beyond
being cultured. So it’s not implausible
that evolution hit upon the same fundamental outside-inside organisation as the cell. It is
also curious that we use the word ‘expression’ to talk about the outcomes of
both genetic and human brain activity.  The evolution of this capacity to
      generate Appreciative States in our brains, in quantity, could thus have
      been the key event that gave us our evolutionary advantage – the missing
      link that anthropologists have been searching for. When we look at
      the detail and formulate the constants of shared Appreciative State
      construction (between the Gene/cell and Understanding/brain)  - constants which are ‘fulfilled’ by variables of the level -
      we also start to see an organisational resonance at other levels; with
      other internal-external systems: in physiology, in social identity, in
      technology, in institutions, in law and policy, to nation states and
      higher. In that resonance, we also can see that failure to attain or
      maintain higher Appreciative States can result in collapses and ensuing
      power struggles between the higher and lower respective levels. The most prominent examples of this are
      disease, mental illness, social oppression, revolution and international
      conflicts. As a form of supportive evidence
      for the existence of Appreciative States (and our prior ignorance of
      them), we find ourselves observing a sort of domino effect.  With solutions
      to a significant number of debates tumbling in sequence. This constitutes a form of proof for the work and its core idea. This, plus the realisation that we can
      now see a substructure or pattern to human expression with the potential to put in order (realign) a number
      human domains that don't function correctly (see list), enables us to pull together the pieces of the
      historically difficult human nature and activity puzzle. The Appreciate
      State provides us with a common framework or surface upon which we can
      reliably compare and fit together domain edges, effectively giving us
      a bigger picture and a unifying theory of human expression. 

The parts of the puzzle that the full work will impact
on - either directly seen, implied by debates or even political correctness - are
as follows: 
The neural correlates of consciousness (a mechanism);
A theory of Intelligence (and AI);
The Nature v Nurture debate (the solution);

Why Homo sapiens are drawn to use Art, Philosophy, Science and/or Religion to create, stabilise and maintain understanding;
How Mental Health struggles develop, persist and can be reversed - the total framework promises sharper tools in human assistance fields;
The syntax in the construction of Language and why there are 6 constant questions in our language (who, what, when, where, why, how) whose answers are important in the formulation of ‘information’ and its assembly; 
The transmission process that is Education and that of Culture (definitions); 

The formation of social Identity (definition);

Oppression theory (clarity of the constituent elements involved in the '-isms');

Why certain phenomena are very important in our social fabric such as Respect, Free Speech, social justice and democratic process; 
A new framework theory for science in Politics; 
A workable framework, to measure and compare the political health of a nation. 




With all its promise, the work needs to be out in the public domain and examined. So my campaign is to get assistance to finalise this important work and publish it as a book.

<p>I have been daring myself to write a book
since I was a child. In fact, it is on my bucket list. But I’ve been perplexed
about what style of book to write since I admire many genres. My mind works in
extremely imaginative ways, so fiction always seemed to be my best bet. <i>Who would be my audience? What kind of story
should I tell, realistic or fantasy?</i> Although I pondered these questions, I
was never able to determine their answers. When I began writing my blog for
Pink Pantie Confessions, I tended toward anecdotes, insights, and poetry. After
much consideration, I have decided this is as good a place as any to start my
literary journey. In fact, this book will include some of my blog and Facebook
status posts.  But most importantly I want to include you the fan into this book. From your writing to simply acknowledging your support. It's not just about me. I'm letting you know you are important to me.  This book is about US! You can change someone's life by how you treat them I want to tell the story about you, the everyday person that change the world one small act at a time.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>It is my hope that you and I will link
together on this journey. My belief is that we are all, every one of us,
interconnected through energy exchange. I feel your presence as I write these
words. It should be overwhelming but it is not. I choose to perceive your
laughter, tears and understanding.  I
discern love and companionship in this intimate conversation.  So help me bring the ""hot pink"" back into blue.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>

This book is a testament that I am not defined by my traumatic experiences, and that sharing these experiences is not only critical to my healing process but everyone who reads this book and is healing. Writing this book helped me from harboring my pain and my thoughts, transcending my perspective of life from being to end. </p>

These parts can be read as one because they focus on how I experienced love and heartbreak after overcoming the mental barriers of my traumas.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong>, entitled ""Un(de)r (Press)ure"" focuses on the theme of depression and trauma, and can be read as one with <strong>Part 6</strong>, entitled ""Point of View"", which contains poems on various topics such as how the gentrification of my hometown affected me, the LBGTQ+ community and its influence on me, why it is essential to take breaks from social media, sins or what is perceived as such, and much more.<br/><br/><strong>Part 7</strong>, entitled ""religion reMASTERed"" can be read as one with <strong>Part 8</strong>, ""The Purge"", and <strong>Part 9</strong>, ""The F Word"", pays homage to what helped me the most during my healing process, religion and therapy; accompanied by what I discovered and the recollection of memories I found it hard to remember that shaped who I was. This is all about how I learned to be strong, believing in the power of forgiveness.<br/><br/><strong>Part 10</strong>, entitled ""The Benediction"" contains poems about all the things I want to remember after overcoming the themes in the aforementioned parts. These are lessons I have learned and I  describe how I should live moving forward.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>Making Your Path is about approaching the professional world from a philosophical lens. I’ve spoken to a variety of path blazers and opportunity creators and discovered what truly drives them, in order to determine how we can apply these same truths on our professional paths.<br/><br/>My name is Jacob Mass and I am the author of Making Your Path. I wrote this book because I’m a young professional entering the workforce, and I wasn’t satisfied with the existing professional content. So much of it is focused purely on success and ambition. I wanted to understand the heart of it, the driving philosophies behind these great professionals.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new ways to think about your career and the way that you approach it, no matter what stage you’re in. I’ve boiled down many of the overarching truths that different professionals have come across and how these truths have impacted their drive for happiness. Ultimately, I want you to gain this wisdom that I’ve documented by speaking to these various professionals and use it as a tool to steer your own path more deliberately, and shape your professional life how you want.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about some of the key forces behind the minds of great makers, including the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Bob Greenberg, one of the first 11 Microsoft employees, who only stayed for a few years before taking off on his own professional path full of ups and downs.</li>
<li>Ralph Baer, the Father of Video Games, who was originally an electrical engineer at a defense company before he took his own initiative of heading an entirely new project that would become the first video game console.</li>
<li>John Park, a professional maker and content creator whose career has incorporated dozens of different skill sets over multiple decades, with each new opportunity being built from the last one’s experience.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>You will love this book if you value taking a deeper look at how you’re crafting your life, and in particular, your career. You will love this book if you want to better understand yourself and the world around you through the ideals of great makers. You will love this book if you’re someone who enjoys your profession and wants to dive even deeper from a place of meaning.<br/><br/>Making Your Path is a nonfiction book that speaks to current and future makers, innovators, inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, and many more who want to learn to harness the driving philosophies of the professional world.</p>
<h2>The Book - Making Your Path</h2>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:<br/><br/>Part 1 focuses on framing the book and discussing relevant concepts to approaching this book such as reassigning meaning to buzzwords and cliches.<br/><br/>Part 2 serves as the main bulk of the book in which each chapter features an overall driving philosophy and how it has played a role in the lives of different makers. Examples of these driving philosophies are the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness.<br/><br/>Part 3 revisits each driving philosophy and how you can harness them in your own career. It discusses how to move forward in making your path.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<p>As a young professional preparing to enter the workforce, Jacob became curious about the human, personal side of the professional world. He didn’t see enough of a focus on it, so he decided to research it himself, speaking with dozens of professionals from different backgrounds. He hopes to share the insights he gained from this journey with others.</p>

Story of My Book
Making Your Path is about approaching the professional world from a philosophical lens. I’ve spoken to a variety of path blazers and opportunity creators and discovered what truly drives them, in order to determine how we can apply these same truths on our professional paths.My name is Jacob Mass and I am the author of Making Your Path. I wrote this book because I’m a young professional entering the workforce, and I wasn’t satisfied with the existing professional content. So much of it is focused purely on success and ambition. I wanted to understand the heart of it, the driving philosophies behind these great professionals.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new ways to think about your career and the way that you approach it, no matter what stage you’re in. I’ve boiled down many of the overarching truths that different professionals have come across and how these truths have impacted their drive for happiness. Ultimately, I want you to gain this wisdom that I’ve documented by speaking to these various professionals and use it as a tool to steer your own path more deliberately, and shape your professional life how you want.In this book, you'll learn about some of the key forces behind the minds of great makers, including the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness. You'll hear stories such as...

Bob Greenberg, one of the first 11 Microsoft employees, who only stayed for a few years before taking off on his own professional path full of ups and downs.
Ralph Baer, the Father of Video Games, who was originally an electrical engineer at a defense company before he took his own initiative of heading an entirely new project that would become the first video game console.
John Park, a professional maker and content creator whose career has incorporated dozens of different skill sets over multiple decades, with each new opportunity being built from the last one’s experience.


You will love this book if you value taking a deeper look at how you’re crafting your life, and in particular, your career. You will love this book if you want to better understand yourself and the world around you through the ideals of great makers. You will love this book if you’re someone who enjoys your profession and wants to dive even deeper from a place of meaning.Making Your Path is a nonfiction book that speaks to current and future makers, innovators, inventors, entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, and many more who want to learn to harness the driving philosophies of the professional world.
The Book - Making Your Path
The book is written in 3 parts:Part 1 focuses on framing the book and discussing relevant concepts to approaching this book such as reassigning meaning to buzzwords and cliches.Part 2 serves as the main bulk of the book in which each chapter features an overall driving philosophy and how it has played a role in the lives of different makers. Examples of these driving philosophies are the Pursuit of Knowledge and Uniqueness.Part 3 revisits each driving philosophy and how you can harness them in your own career. It discusses how to move forward in making your path.
What We Need & What You Get

About the Author
Jacob Mass is an undergraduate student at the University of Florida. He is pursuing a degree in Digital Arts and Sciences, as well as a minor in Percussion Performance and a certificate in Graphic Design. He also works with the UF Engineering Innovation Institute.
As a young professional preparing to enter the workforce, Jacob became curious about the human, personal side of the professional world. He didn’t see enough of a focus on it, so he decided to research it himself, speaking with dozens of professionals from different backgrounds. He hopes to share the insights he gained from this journey with others.
Jacob was originally born in Montville, New Jersey and now lives in Parkland, Florida with his family and Lucy the puppy. He enjoys gardening and the occasional Zumba class. He’s slowly learning to cook, and he looks forward to long car rides so he can loudly sing along to his music.
For more information, you can connect with Jacob at jjmass721@gmail.com and on Instagram (@jacobmasscreative), Facebook, and LinkedIn.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.
The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #MakingYourPath and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.

Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Jacob Mass",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Seattle won $15 this past summer, San Francisco is voting to raise their minimum wage to $15 this November, and fast food workers around the country are engaging in strikes and walkouts to demand $15/hr from the multi-billion dollar companies they work for. </p>
<p>The need for a $15 minimum wage is just as vital in Oregon as it is elsewhere. Inflation in Oregon was almost 3% during 2013, double the national rate. Last year Portland saw the cost of rent increase by 4.5%, and the cost of eating out at restaurants increased by over 6%. According to studies by both the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the Alliance for a Just Society a living wage for a single worker in Oregon, enough to pay their bills and plan ahead for emergencies, is around $16/hr.  Meanwhile, almost 90% of the income gains in Oregon since 1979 have gone to the top 1%. But it doesn't have to be that way.</p>
<p>The only reason companies make money is because workers produce things that people buy. It is the labor of the working class produces the trillions of dollars that make up our country's Gross Domestic Product. If we took all the workers out of McDonald's restaurants how much money would the company make? None. Big business can afford to pay a living wage. It is time workers in Oregon got their fair share of the wealth they create!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>This is our first big fundraising effort! In order to effectively run a campaign to raise the minimum wage throughout Oregon we need resources! In order to keep this a grassroots working class fight, we need raise money from working people to help win better material conditions for the working class. In Seattle, 15 Now spent over $150,000 to wind a $15 minimum wage. It will take even more to win for the whole state of Oregon.</p>
<p>A portion of the money raised here will go to the 15 Now national organization to help build the movement to raise the minimum wage across the country. Most of the money will be used here on the ground in Oregon. Banners, signs, printing flyers, food and space for meetings, phone calls and texts, brochures, travel and materials to help build new 15 Now chapters throughout the state, and many, many hours for canvassing and making follow up phone calls all cost money and time. Much of this money has been coming out of the pockets of dedicated volunteers. And as we're currently growing exponentially as we form new 15 Now chapters across the state of Oregon, our costs are growing exponentially as well!</p>
<p>Your donation will allow us to spend more time in the field running community trainings and gathering stories from workers. It will allow us to provide ""Raise the Minimum Wage"" t-shirts to folks who can't afford them.  It will allow us to send workers to 15 Now national trainings and workshops to meet other involved low-wage workers. It will allow us to blanket our cities with 15 Now signs, posters, banners, and stickers! It will expand our ability to provide consistent meeting spaces and remain in contact with workers and volunteers across the state via more sophisticated means of communication. </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We face many obstacles in our work to raise the standard of living for Oregon's working class. In Seattle, Big Business fought tooth and nail trying to prevent a $15 minimum wage. Those who make their money off the labor of others are willing to use their unlimited political clout and unimaginable monetary resources they have to lobby our public officials and beat back any attempt by working class people to fight for higher wages. As we grow, we know they'll spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to send lobbyists to influence our public officials, run radio ads and put up billboards to promulgate ugly myths about the effects of raising wages.</p>
<p>In addition, working people have been systematically disenfranchised and disempowered for decades. It takes time, energy, and dedication to prepare people to fight back against managers and business owners who use intimidation and discouragement to prevent workers from fighting for better wages and working conditions. But working people have pressing financial commitments and time limitations to navigate as they engage in political struggle. Political movements are not instantaneous-- they take training, empowerment and dedication from everyone involved.  <br/></p>

<p>Introductions.
I’d like to first say thanks for clicking your way to this point. My name is
Xxavier Edward Carter, I’m an artist, born in Dallas, Texas, 1986. I went to
college at Stanford University. I’m currently in Lisbon, Portugal. I’m working on
my second novel and growing my art practice. My artistic practice is rooted in
text making itself present through printmaking, video art, painting, drawing,
design, photography, audio works, and performance pieces. My work utilizes the
entire of a space to exhibit the visual weight of the architecture, emotive
resonance, historical context, and the constantly evolving narrative of the
people.</p>
<h1>So
why are we here? You may be asking yourself.</h1>
<p>I
want to produce my second novel, WE’RE FROM AMERICA, as a serial novel. The
concept is I’ll release it in several 100 or so page increments then sending
the completed text in one clean package. WE’RE FROM AMERICA is the second book
in a series that follows the daughters of the Ashby Family. Each book is told
from a different POV. Here’s a synopsis.</p>
<p><i>WE’RE FROM AMERICA is
the first hand account of the life of Boo Ashby, youngest daughter,
International Rockstar, stage name, Charlye Monroe. A series of events takes
Boo into the underworld where she meets the real Charlye Monroe, origins
unknown. The pair are off on an adventure through America, all of it. What
better place to put yourself back together than in the presence of your alter
ego. This book contains graphic violence, gore, sex, and rock and roll. </i></p>
<p>I’m
collecting funds for a professional editor. From experience, editing is the
most difficult part of the writing process, just try writing a text message. It
took three editions for BF Chronicles to reach its present state. I don’t want
that same thing to happen for WE’RE FROM AMERICA and I think an editor is the
best way to solve that problem. I am current 118 pages in and on part two of
the story. Going back over the text is motivating but it takes a lot of time
and kills the momentum. With this campaign I want to get things rolling full
steam and have the ability to create unbound. Of course it’s not going to solve
everything in the text but all those annoying little typos and syntax errors
will be dealt with much faster this way. So, on to what you are getting out of
this wonderful exchange.</p>

</div></div>","Bürgerklage gegen CETA Ich möchte das Freihandelsabkommen zwischen EU und Kanada ""CETA"" per Verfassungsbeschwerde stoppen. Dazu habe ich den renommierten Rechtsprofessor Dr. Andreas Fisahn aus Bielefeld engagiert. Jeder Bürger kann sich der Klage kostenlos anschließen. Dies sollte die größte Verfassungsbeschwerde in der Geschichte Deutschlands werden.   
Verfassungsbeschwerde Die Kosten für die Verfassungsbeschwerde belaufen sich mit den verschiedenen entstehenden Unkosten auf insgesamt auf 14.000 EUR. Diesen Betrag kann ich als Privatperson nicht alleine stemmen. Daher bitte ich um Ihre Unterstützung.  

Die Folgen
 CETA kann durch das Bundesverfassungsgericht verbindlich gestoppt werden. Nur so können wir die Demokratie und Recht der Bürger vor dem entfesselten Freihandel schützen.   
Risiken & Herausforderungen Es ist möglich, dass das Bundesverfassungsgericht unsere Verfassungsbeschwerde ablehnt, aber wir müssen es zumindest versuchen. 

Andere Wege, wie man helfen kann

<p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
<p>I am stoked! I am almost complete with the first draft of my new novel! After two years of scribbling madly in composition journals, over-caffeinated wild tapping on the keys of my laptop, and dictating notes and dialogue on a voice dictation app while driving, the end is in sight. It is currently over 500 pages!</p>
<p>The story is a post-apocalyptic epic quest, driven by a genderqueer protagonist. It is about finding home and finding oneself.</p>
<p>I really love this story and I know you will too. It’s a bit Mists of Avalon, a bit Red Tent, a bit Wraeththu, and something else altogether. I can’t wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>The next phase, after completing the draft, is revision. I have reached out to a mentor of mine, Josh Mohr, who offers editorial services under his business Decant Editorial. To see my manuscript be the best it can be before it reaches the desks of publishers and literary agents, working with a skilled editor is imperative. Unfortunately these services are not cheap! The charges for 8 – 10 weeks of one-on-one editorial assistance is $2700 - $3400.</p>
<p>I am asking my community for help. If you feel inclined, please contribute what you can so that this work can be its very best and to help propel me toward having my dream come true of getting published. I know this work is worthy of publication and I want to give myself, and the world, this gift.</p>
<p>I so much appreciate any generous amount you offer, and all the ways you have helped and supported me in my life.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Advised by several literary agents and editors that her manuscript was compelling and rife with commercial potential but needed the skills of a professional co-writer to make it publishable, Shirley Turner contacted the English Department at the University of Maine. Her request for help included some of the details in this memoir, and perhaps because I have long taught Richard Hoffman’s Half the House, I was drawn to her story. Over the course of two years, three women took up and then abandoned the cause due to the intensity of Shirley’s manuscript, before I met Tina Passman, the Angel who shepherded this book into its present narrative form. She tinkered with little but syntax, grammar, and punctuation, with an eye to eliminating repeated information. By faithfully preserving Shirley’s voice, Tina allows this story to unfold as if the reader were hearing it over coffee at Shirley and Paul’s house on a snowy Maine afternoon. Nothing has been held back, but neither has anything been accentuated for effect. This is the straightforward telling of as difficult a story as I have ever heard. In the end, this is a journey of triumph, a story that exalts the incredible courage of one human being who refused to buckle under a barrage of despair, hatred, and trauma, inspired by the one pure love of her life. A story that needs to be heard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $3000 to get the book published and distributed. This will cover all the print set up, editing, cover costs, as well as place the book with a highly regarded press and distribution service.</li>
<li>Each contributor of at least $20 will receive a copy of the finished book.</li>
<li>If we  don't reach our entire goal<i>, I have pledged to make up the difference myself</i>. This is how much I believe this story must be told.</li>
<li>Having said that, we truly need the support of everyone to make this project a reality. And please remember that ALL proceeds go to Shirley and that neither Tina nor I have any financial interest in this book.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>The Destroying Angel </i> is unique and without artifice, driven by Shirley's original voice. In a world often swamped with anger and hatred, this memoir proves how courage and love can face down evil. </p>
<p>This is not an <i>as told to book</i>, but rather a distinctly human memoir. Its publication will be a testament to the Shirley's perseverance and a revelation to all who read it</p>
<p>In my position as editor of the acclaimed annual anthology <i>American Fiction</i>, I read over 600 short stories each year, many inventive and inspiring, but this true story moved me more than  any fiction I have read in years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We need these funds to complete this project. Shirley and Paul live day to day in rural northern Maine in the most precarious of financial circumstances. This is why she cannot do this by herself, and though my wife and I will help, we cannot fully fund this either.</p>
<p>Once the goal is reached and we can be sure the book will be published, we'll be looking to set up media interviews and appearances to help promote this to a wider audience. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't at this time contribute, <i>you can help</i>. Please share this link with everyone you can via social media like Facebook and Twitter, and ask those you share it with to share it with their contacts and followers as well.</p>

Nothing has been held back, but neither has anything been accentuated for effect. This is the straightforward telling of as difficult a story as I have ever heard. In the end, this is a journey of triumph, a story that exalts the incredible courage of one human being who refused to buckle under a barrage of despair, hatred, and trauma, inspired by the one pure love of her life. A story that needs to be heard.

What We Need & What You Get 

We need $3000 to get the book published and distributed. This will cover all the print set up, editing, cover costs, as well as place the book with a highly regarded press and distribution service.
Each contributor of at least $20 will receive a copy of the finished book.
If we  don't reach our entire goal, I have pledged to make up the difference myself. This is how much I believe this story must be told.
Having said that, we truly need the support of everyone to make this project a reality. And please remember that ALL proceeds go to Shirley and that neither Tina nor I have any financial interest in this book.


The Impact
The Destroying Angel  is unique and without artifice, driven by Shirley's original voice. In a world often swamped with anger and hatred, this memoir proves how courage and love can face down evil. 
This is not an as told to book, but rather a distinctly human memoir. Its publication will be a testament to the Shirley's perseverance and a revelation to all who read it
In my position as editor of the acclaimed annual anthology American Fiction, I read over 600 short stories each year, many inventive and inspiring, but this true story moved me more than  any fiction I have read in years.

Risks & Challenges
We need these funds to complete this project. Shirley and Paul live day to day in rural northern Maine in the most precarious of financial circumstances. This is why she cannot do this by herself, and though my wife and I will help, we cannot fully fund this either.
Once the goal is reached and we can be sure the book will be published, we'll be looking to set up media interviews and appearances to help promote this to a wider audience.

<h3><font><font><font><font>All about Jo:</font></font></font></font></h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Josephine Myles and I live in Somerset, England with my partner and two children--a toddler and an 11 year-old with special needs. I've been publishing male/male erotic romance for the past seven years--mostly with Samhain Publishing. Unfortunately Samhain found it difficult to make ends meet in the current publishing climate and closed for business at the end of February 2017. I now find myself in the position of needing to get my Samhain backlist of nine titles (eight novels and one novella) back onto the virtual bookshelves as soon as possible. And to do that, I'm going to need a helping hand. But don't worry--I'll be rewarding all contributors handsomely with the books they've helped to republish! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><font><font><font><font>The nitty gritty:</font></font></font></font></h3>
<p>I'm going to need to raise approximately $800 to buy back the cover art for my ebooks, as well as commissioning new covers for a few that need a facelift. Books need covers, I think you'll agree! But you won't have to judge these purely by their covers, because as a contributor you'll get some (or all!) of these ebooks for yourself. I aim to send out each individual title as ""perks"" as soon as they are ready, which will be at least a couple of days before they're back on the virtual bookshelves. The delivery date on the perks shows November 2017 because that's the absolute last date I'll get the final book out to contributors, but I'll be aiming to fulfil all the perks long before then.</p>
<p>Rest assured you'll also be getting a really good deal, as the retail price of all nine ebooks together will be $28.91--that's a total saving of $19.91!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><font><font><font><font>Risks &amp; Challenges</font></font></font></font></h3>
<p>I've self-published quite a few books in the past (four novellas, 8 short stories and 9 anthologies) so I'm well aware of the amount of work involved. However, I'm also well aware of how little spare time I have these days what with looking after a toddler full-time, and how the trials and tribulations of family life can easily scupper my plans for work. That's why I've set a realistic re-release schedule, aiming to get one book out a month for the next nine months. This is the provisional schedule for the ebooks (paperback editions will hopefully stick to the same schedule, but might take a few weeks longer):</p>
<p>March: How to Train Your Dom in Five Easy Steps</p>
<p>April: Screwing the System</p>
<p>May: The Hot Floor</p>
<p>June: Junk</p>
<p>July: Stuff</p>
<p>August: Scrap</p>
<p>September: Handle with Care</p>
<p>October: Barging In</p>
<p>November: Merry Gentlemen</p>
<p>Now, in an ideal world I'd like to get the whole backlist republished as soon as possible, but I wanted to allow myself plenty of extra time so I don't get stressed, ill, and make my family unhappy. If things go swimmingly and I can get the books done sooner then I will (which means you'll get your perks sooner!), but I'd rather build that extra time in from the start so as not to put too much pressure on me. A small amount of pressure is motivating, but too much soon becomes a major stressor. And would get in the way of me writing new material, which I'm sure you're all keen for too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><font><font><font><font>Other Ways You Can Help</font></font></font></font></h3>
<p><font><font><font><font>If you can't possibly contribute financially but would still like to help out, there are plenty of things you could do. Why not post a link to the campaign on social media? Or you could leave a review of one of my books on Amazon or Goodreads. Any raised awareness of my books will help me out, and I'll be ever so grateful :D</font></font></font></font></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>But why THEIA? </b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">THEIA was inspired by the Greek goddess Theia, the mother of the sun and the goddess of light.   She spreads the message of beauty and freedom, which is synonymous with our brand and values.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430716247/fs9uinfl8li4357ddygm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<blockquote><i>“We want every woman to feel like a goddess!  THEIA will get your fake tan off and your goddess on.” </i></blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>How it works  </b></h2>
<p>THEIA is an advanced patent pending, simple 2-step process.  Remove it!  Restore it!</p>
<p>THEIA is a sophisticated blend of non harmful active ingredients and pure botanical extracts.  This gentle, yet powerful combination works effectively with the amino acids on the top layer of the skin.  This dissolves the fake tan pigment, allowing it to be gently wiped away.<br/></p>
<p><b>REMOVE IT</b> with THEIA Express Tan Remover with Acai Berry and Waterlily Extract</p>
<p><b>RESTORE IT</b> with THEIA Liquid Micro Peel with Argan Oil</p>
<blockquote>
<i>“I've never seen a fake tan remover work so fast and so easily.  I also love the micro peel”.  </i><i style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Maddy Kane - Professional Model.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Step 1: REMOVE IT</b> - A delicate, yet powerful formula that softens and strips your tan off in minutes. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spray THEIA  Express Tan Remover over any fake tan residue, wait two minutes, then wipe clean with THEIA removal cloth.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Step 2: RESTORE IT </b>- A multi functional micro peel to remove any remaining tan residue, remove dead skin cells, restore pH levels and leave you with a boost of soothing, anti inflammatory botanicals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Spray the Liquid Micro Peel onto skin and start small circular movements with your hand.  You will actually see the dead skin fall of right in front of your eyes.</p>

<blockquote>''I fake tan every week. I like to have a bit of colour. I feel confident until the tan starts breaking up and looking patchy. I spend hours scrubbing and trying to soften it in the bath. I've tried every product on the shelves. When I tried THEIA I was in disbelief! It was easy to wipe my skin clean and I absolutely loved the micro peel, my skin feels softer and very even all over. This will now be my go to. I feel less stressed about the thought of getting it off and prepping for a new tan.''  <b style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Portia Kelly. </span>Influencer<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></b>

<blockquote>''I am a professional model. I have to tan sometimes twice a week.

</div></div>","Press talking about THEIA...






We all love a tan.


That bronzed, shimmering, healthy glow that you slip into before a fabulous party, big event or in prep for that daunting first bikini wear of the season.  As we learn more about the dangers of sun tanning, fake tan has become the go-to for every girl.   BUT, what about those times when your tan goes wrong?  You wake up looking like you’ve just been cast as an Oompa Loompa in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory. It starts with a look in the mirror.  First the shock hits you, then the realisation that the wedding, the party, the event starts in approximately two hours.YOU NEED TO GET THIS TAN OFF!  
You may scrub and scrub, and scrub some more with anything in sight or one of the ‘tan removal’ products currently available.  And the result?  Fake-tan that hasn’t budged and red raw skin.  You then take matters into your own hands… an industrial level kitchen scrubber, a lemon juice bath or perhaps event resort to a bath of Ajax (true story!)So, maybe it’s not that drastic every time.  Maybe you’ve just encountered a few annoying stains on your hands, feet or ankles.  Maybe after a week of a fabulous faux glow, your tan is now beginning to get patchy and honestly looks pretty shocking. We hear you.  For years we’ve been listening to complaints from fake tan enthusiasts, friends and models about their fake tan disasters and the marathon efforts they’ve gone through to remove it.  We’ve listened to women who have told us they’ve wasted hours scrubbing and damaging their skin.What if tan removal was as simple as spritz & wipe off?  Imagine an express fake tan remover that works in just two minutes, no scrubbing required!  Well now it’s possible… Introducing THEIA In response to the demand, we worked with one of the world’s leading formulators to create THEIA, a 2-step, fuss-free tan removal system.  Starting with the Express Fake Tan Remover, you’ll watch unsightly tan wipe away in a matter of minutes.  No more embarrassing moments or painful hours between tans.  No more cancelling dates or bronzing over patches.  And definitely no longer a need for harsh scrubbing and aggressive chemicals.                  THEIA goes a step further.  We follow the tan removal with the Liquid Micro Peel to eliminate any remaining dead skin cells and leave your body polished, feeling smoother than ever. We all love options.  THEIA works for everyone.  It can lighten a tan that you find too dark, remove a five day old tan residue, or cleanse, polish and buff your entire body whenever you feel it’s time to return back to your original skin. We are proud to say THEIA is completely safe – no nasties here!  It’s formulated with natural and non-harmful active ingredients and is packed with a sophisticated blend of botanicals such as Aloe, Camomile, Orange Oil, Argan Oil and Acai Berry. There are no parabens or sulfates, no harsh preservatives, no artificial colours and of course we don’t test on animals.  THEIA is also vegan friendly.


Put simply, THEIA is the perfect blend of science & nature.

But why THEIA? 
THEIA was inspired by the Greek goddess Theia, the mother of the sun and the goddess of light.   She spreads the message of beauty and freedom, which is synonymous with our brand and values.



“We want every woman to feel like a goddess!  THEIA will get your fake tan off and your goddess on.” 


How it works  
THEIA is an advanced patent pending, simple 2-step process.  Remove it!  Restore it!
THEIA is a sophisticated blend of non harmful active ingredients and pure botanical extracts.  This gentle, yet powerful combination works effectively with the amino acids on the top layer of the skin.  This dissolves the fake tan pigment, allowing it to be gently wiped away.
REMOVE IT with THEIA Express Tan Remover with Acai Berry and Waterlily Extract
RESTORE IT with THEIA Liquid Micro Peel with Argan Oil

“I've never seen a fake tan remover work so fast and so easily.  I also love the micro peel”.  Maddy Kane - Professional Model.



Step 1: REMOVE IT - A delicate, yet powerful formula that softens and strips your tan off in minutes. 
Spray THEIA  Express Tan Remover over any fake tan residue, wait two minutes, then wipe clean with THEIA removal cloth.


Step 2: RESTORE IT - A multi functional micro peel to remove any remaining tan residue, remove dead skin cells, restore pH levels and leave you with a boost of soothing, anti inflammatory botanicals.
Spray the Liquid Micro Peel onto skin and start small circular movements with your hand.  You will actually see the dead skin fall of right in front of your eyes.








Who are we?  
Meet the creators.  We are Brie, Michelle and Mamun; together we have over 40 years of experience in the beauty industry.  We wanted to take this knowledge and experience to create something amazing and something the beauty world really needs. We know there are a lot of products on the market, new ones arriving in stores every week, especially in tanning.  However THEIA is very unique, you can remove your tan completely or simply bring it down a shade. We have created a product that our friends and clients have been screaming for - a quality product that works and is affordable. 






What people are saying about THEIA

''I fake tan every week. I like to have a bit of colour. I feel confident until the tan starts breaking up and looking patchy. I spend hours scrubbing and trying to soften it in the bath. I've tried every product on the shelves. When I tried THEIA I was in disbelief! It was easy to wipe my skin clean and I absolutely loved the micro peel, my skin feels softer and very even all over. This will now be my go to. I feel less stressed about the thought of getting it off and prepping for a new tan.''  Portia Kelly. Influencer. 

''I have tried the THEIA kit five times now, it's a dream come true for me because I have spent years scrubbing and using harsh chemicals. Sometimes I just use it for my hands and others times I use it for my entire body.  I also feel really hydrated after the micro peel.  I'm a devotee for life!''  Jessica McDonald, Professional Photographer.

''I am a professional model. I have to tan sometimes twice a week. We are expected to be tanned sometimes one day and have completely natural skin a day or two later.  This has been completely impossible until now.  THEIA removes my fresh tan even when it's not breaking up.  This is a life saver for people in my industry! I will never travel without a kit on hand.''  Madeleine Kane, Professional Model.

Our Funding Goal. We have self funded the development and formulation of THEIA since conception in 2013.  After two years of research and development we began international testing trials and small manufacturing runs.  We are now ready to take THEIA to the world and to do this we need $120,000 USD.  This collective investment will fund our bulk manufacturing costs and global distribution.  



What is included in the THEIA kit? 

1 x THEIA Express Tan Remover with Acai Berry and Waterlily Extract
1 x THEIA Liquid Micro Peel with Argan Oil
I x THEIA Removal Cloth
1 x THEIA Waterproof Travel Bag

We know not everyone interested in seeing poetry in the public eye has money to contribute.  You can still help the movement:  please share our need and the indiegogo web site at poetry slams, in poetry groups that you attend and among your friends. Indiegogo has share tools, please look into them and use any that are appropriate to you.  With your help, this will be a rare case of poetry making money!  
Thank you all so much for your time and interest.

<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>Kaja Blackley is a Canadian writer and illustrator. He was named one of the 100 Canadians to Watch by Maclean’s Magazine. His work has been adapted for a Hollywood movie, and appears in a variety of print media.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Facts</strong></h3>
<p><i>Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel</i> is finished and professionally edited. The illustrations are also complete. This magical 300-page young- adult novel is being pre-sold to help finance its initial print run.</p>
<p>It was written over a two-year period when Kaja – partially paralyzed, unable to work, and with only his two index fingers free to type with – became determined to write the story he intended to write since his first child was born.</p>
<p>Kaja was the first supporter of this Indiegogo campaign, investing $1000 of his own money when this campaign went live.</p>

<h3><strong>The Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Around the time Kaja’s wife, Christina, gave birth to their daughter there were lots of boys’ adventures that girls enjoyed, like the story of the boy wizard with Coke-bottle glasses who took the world by broomstick; but there wasn’t a girl’s adventure story, especially one featuring a strong girl in a world that brings out that strength, that resonated <i>as universally. </i></p>
<p>Their daughter became the inspiration for<i> Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel.</i></p>

<h3><strong>The Story </strong></h3>
<p>Maggie is a ginger-haired, twelve-year-old orphan who has been passed from one foster family to the next all her life. She never knows where she’ll end up so she’s become suspicious and independent, scrappy and resourceful.</p>
<p>As the story begins, Maggie is placed yet again into foster care – this time into a much more welcoming family. But Maggie can't shake the feeling that something is a bit off about her new home. She slowly ends up having to toss everything she understood about herself and her life out the window. But by that time, things have gone awry – it’s too late for her to run from the approaching danger.</p>
<p><i>Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel</i> is often times quite charming, while at other times nail-bitingly grim. It is a love letter to imagination, gripping adventure and Earth’s environment.</p>

<h3>Why Kaja Publishes Through His Own Imprint</h3>

Kaja Blackley is a Canadian writer and illustrator. He was named one of the 100 Canadians to Watch by Maclean’s Magazine. His work has been adapted for a Hollywood movie, and appears in a variety of print media.
 
The Facts
Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel is finished and professionally edited. The illustrations are also complete. This magical 300-page young- adult novel is being pre-sold to help finance its initial print run.
It was written over a two-year period when Kaja – partially paralyzed, unable to work, and with only his two index fingers free to type with – became determined to write the story he intended to write since his first child was born.
Kaja was the first supporter of this Indiegogo campaign, investing $1000 of his own money when this campaign went live.

The Inspiration
Around the time Kaja’s wife, Christina, gave birth to their daughter there were lots of boys’ adventures that girls enjoyed, like the story of the boy wizard with Coke-bottle glasses who took the world by broomstick; but there wasn’t a girl’s adventure story, especially one featuring a strong girl in a world that brings out that strength, that resonated as universally. 
Their daughter became the inspiration for Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel.

The Story 
Maggie is a ginger-haired, twelve-year-old orphan who has been passed from one foster family to the next all her life. She never knows where she’ll end up so she’s become suspicious and independent, scrappy and resourceful.
As the story begins, Maggie is placed yet again into foster care – this time into a much more welcoming family. But Maggie can't shake the feeling that something is a bit off about her new home. She slowly ends up having to toss everything she understood about herself and her life out the window. But by that time, things have gone awry – it’s too late for her to run from the approaching danger.
Maggie MacCormack and the Witches’ Wheel is often times quite charming, while at other times nail-bitingly grim. It is a love letter to imagination, gripping adventure and Earth’s environment.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Storytime:</u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>About the Author</u></h3>
<p><i>  **For those who would rather <strong>watch</strong> the details of this campaign and the author, simply click on the Campaign Video**</i></p>
<p>            When I started performing professionally at the age of twelve, I never really knew where the journey would lead me. As a songwriter and recording artist, I was fortunate enough to have three top ten songs on the national charts, not to mention having the privilege of performing with top names in the Country music industry such as Loretta Lynn, Charlie Daniels and Pat Boone. </p>
<p>            As my career diversified, I co-hosted Music City Today, a nationally syndicated television, and also hosted my own show called, Music and Entertainment Tonight. As an actor, I have been involved in an ever-growing list of television shows and films, which includes <i>A Walk In The Woods</i>, allowing me to share a bit of screen time with the Nick Nolte and Robert Redford.  </p>
<p>             Along the way, my passion for American History consumed my heart and mind, so I created a new genre in the industry that I dubbed “edutainment”. I combined my music and acting into a one-man show, traveling all over Tennessee to schools and events, which allowed me to bring characters like General George Washington and Colonel David ""Davy"" Crockett from the pages of history, into the open for all to enjoy. </p>
<p>            My life seemed to be going smoothly, until my father’s health began to gradually deteriorate. By 2013, Lewy Body Dementia took over his very being and sense of self. I had always promised my parents I would take care of them when they grew old, so when duty came calling, I didn't hesitate to step up. By late 2013, medical facility visits became a constant. There was even one occasion where Mom was sick in one hospital, and Dad was in another. When I brought Dad home for hospice care, I became his full-time caretaker. </p>
<p>            When he passed away on Christmas Eve of 2014, Mom became severely depressed, then her health began declining. She had many setbacks during 2015, then when she fell in January 2016, she broke her wrist, and the situation worsened. After her operation, the anesthesia triggered dementia, causing her behavior and mindset to become more erratic and less predictable. While she remained in a confused state a majority of the time, she refused to take her medication properly. She passed away suddenly in September 2016. </p>
<p>            The time spent taking care of my parents was the most rewarding period of my life. They both wanted to avoid becoming permanent residents in a nursing home, and desired to die peacefully in their own beds at their home on the farm. I'm proud to say that they both got their wish. </p>
<p>            During my time as a caretaker, I needed something to keep myself busy while sitting in the hospital, so I took out my laptop and began to do some writing. I never would have dreamed that this would be the path which God had been pushing me toward all along. </p>
<p>            A friend gave me a book in 2011 titled, “Jack Hinson's One-Man War” by Tom C. McKenney. Shortly after finishing it, I was so inspired that I wrote a song called ""The Ballad of Captain Jack"". After recording it, Tom McKenney heard it for the first time in February of 2012. We became friends in no time, deciding to work jointly on the promotion of his book and my new song. It was during this period that he challenged me to write a movie script about Jack Hinson, so I couldn’t resist. As soon as he read my screenplay, Tom suggested I take the script and expand it into a full-length historical fiction novel. </p>
<p>            After working on the project for over two years, I took a tally of what I had written and realized I had over a thousand pages. I readily made the call to turn the project into a four-book series. Utilizing Tom's biography on Captain Jack as my starting point, I did my own extensive research in twenty-six additional credible resources. Although my book is considered a work of historical fiction, many new details have emerged regarding Jack Hinson and the people he interacted with in his daily life.</p>
<p>            While speaking with Tom in July 2017, I presented him with one of my new findings. It was during this conversation he suggested I call Scott Campbell at River Road Press. Tom took it one step further, making the introductory call himself. Within a few hours, I was speaking with the book publisher on the phone and in December 2017, I drove to New Orleans to meet Mr. Campbell in person. After our visit, I finally had someone who was willing to publish my first book, <i><strong>In The Hills Of Tennessee: The Uncivil War</strong></i>. The book will be in hardcover format, with over sixty black and white illustrations, and historic photos from the 1860’s. Twenty graphic art pieces completed by myself are also included, as well as six illustrations by renowned artist Andy Thomas. </p>
<p>            <strong>At present, the scheduled release of the book is set for October 2018</strong>. Although River Road Press will be paying for all of the expenses to print the books (as well as supplying them in stores), I still have expenses that I must take on myself. As per industry standard, I will receive a case of 24 books free, but the rest of the inventory I must purchase to have product to sell at my book signings. I will also have to incur the cost of reproducing the full color prints of my artwork, the national marketing campaign, and the travel expenses to my book signings/shows. </p>
<p>            This is the part that I am absolutely <i><u>thrilled</u> </i>about. I am turning to family, friends, fellow history lovers, and art connoisseurs to help me get this project off the ground. I have chosen the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform to make it possible for everyone to get involved with this groundbreaking series about Captain Jack Hinson, a man history has yet to forget.  </p>
<p>            I hope to see each of you soon as the book tour comes to your hometown! </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Why Should I Donate to This Campaign?</u></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">      The times we live in are undoubtedly frustrating and horrific. The thought police are on the rise. Political correctness and virtue signaling is all the rage. History is literally being attacked, and we should not allow for it to proceed any further! And all the while, the ones doing the berating are oblivious to the origin behind the events which actually transpired. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Facts are being misconstrued and misrepresented.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The political climate is humid at best, and that is why this series is vital to this generation, and many more to come. History is being erased before us, and even though it's possible this series may not make a dent in the metaphorical barrel that is labeled ""NO FACTS, NO HISTORY"", this is a passionate effort to enlighten the minds of the misinformed, and provide those who are well-versed in the subject more information about the past, with hearty entertainment sprinkled in along the way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Many vital steps need to be taken so we as a nation can make the corrections to history mainstream, as well as preserving the simplicity which magnifies the allure and beauty of the Civil War era. We believe donating to this campaign is not only one of said steps which could generate an open dialogue about the state of our country, but could furthermore <u><i>spread awareness</i></u> about the threat of history being eradicated from our lives.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The remembrance of our ancestors and all those who came before, and the great sacrifices they made so we could enjoy our liberties today, <u>will all be in vain</u> if we cannot find a way to stop this whirlwind of strife that has invaded our government, our schools, our churches, and even our homes.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>New Information Found</strong></u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are also certain places and events which surround the Battle at Fort Donelson and Stewart County, TN, that have not been amended in an official capacity, but are spoken about in the series. It is our highest hope that we can present this new information to historical societies around the country so it can stand corrected!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">     Funding received for this campaign will be going toward the nationwide book tour, set to kick off in October 2018, mere days proceeding the release of the first book in the Chronicles of Captain Jack Hinson series, <i><strong>In the Hills of Tennessee: The Uncivil War</strong></i>. It will also go toward the purchase of cases of books from the publisher, as well as money to use for the art prints.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The full budget is listed in the category below!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There have been tireless efforts to publish this series, and after a decade of hard work and dedication, Rick Revel finally wants to see his life's work come to fruition.</p>
<ul><li>Being such a wide variation of art to choose from in the <u><strong>perks</strong></u> section, we assure you there's definitely something for every student of American History, Civil War enthusiast, or simply even a lover of graphic artwork!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>The Budget</strong></u></h3>
<p>   As the project becomes a success, you will have bragging rights that <u><strong>you</strong></u> helped to get it all started! If you see the book mentioned in a nationally recognized magazine or online venues, we are willing to wager that your heart will swell with pride, knowing you were able to play a role in getting the ball rolling for this series!</p>

<li>There is also a tentative plan to produce a YouTube video trailer with actor portrayals, costing $5,000.00.</li>

About the Author
  **For those who would rather watch the details of this campaign and the author, simply click on the Campaign Video**
            When I started performing professionally at the age of twelve, I never really knew where the journey would lead me. As a songwriter and recording artist, I was fortunate enough to have three top ten songs on the national charts, not to mention having the privilege of performing with top names in the Country music industry such as Loretta Lynn, Charlie Daniels and Pat Boone. 
            As my career diversified, I co-hosted Music City Today, a nationally syndicated television, and also hosted my own show called, Music and Entertainment Tonight. As an actor, I have been involved in an ever-growing list of television shows and films, which includes A Walk In The Woods, allowing me to share a bit of screen time with the Nick Nolte and Robert Redford.  
             Along the way, my passion for American History consumed my heart and mind, so I created a new genre in the industry that I dubbed “edutainment”. I combined my music and acting into a one-man show, traveling all over Tennessee to schools and events, which allowed me to bring characters like General George Washington and Colonel David ""Davy"" Crockett from the pages of history, into the open for all to enjoy. 
            My life seemed to be going smoothly, until my father’s health began to gradually deteriorate. By 2013, Lewy Body Dementia took over his very being and sense of self. I had always promised my parents I would take care of them when they grew old, so when duty came calling, I didn't hesitate to step up. By late 2013, medical facility visits became a constant. There was even one occasion where Mom was sick in one hospital, and Dad was in another. When I brought Dad home for hospice care, I became his full-time caretaker. 
            When he passed away on Christmas Eve of 2014, Mom became severely depressed, then her health began declining. She had many setbacks during 2015, then when she fell in January 2016, she broke her wrist, and the situation worsened. After her operation, the anesthesia triggered dementia, causing her behavior and mindset to become more erratic and less predictable. While she remained in a confused state a majority of the time, she refused to take her medication properly. She passed away suddenly in September 2016. 
            The time spent taking care of my parents was the most rewarding period of my life. They both wanted to avoid becoming permanent residents in a nursing home, and desired to die peacefully in their own beds at their home on the farm. I'm proud to say that they both got their wish. 
            During my time as a caretaker, I needed something to keep myself busy while sitting in the hospital, so I took out my laptop and began to do some writing. I never would have dreamed that this would be the path which God had been pushing me toward all along. 
            A friend gave me a book in 2011 titled, “Jack Hinson's One-Man War” by Tom C. McKenney. Shortly after finishing it, I was so inspired that I wrote a song called ""The Ballad of Captain Jack"". After recording it, Tom McKenney heard it for the first time in February of 2012. We became friends in no time, deciding to work jointly on the promotion of his book and my new song. It was during this period that he challenged me to write a movie script about Jack Hinson, so I couldn’t resist. As soon as he read my screenplay, Tom suggested I take the script and expand it into a full-length historical fiction novel. 
            After working on the project for over two years, I took a tally of what I had written and realized I had over a thousand pages. I readily made the call to turn the project into a four-book series. Utilizing Tom's biography on Captain Jack as my starting point, I did my own extensive research in twenty-six additional credible resources. Although my book is considered a work of historical fiction, many new details have emerged regarding Jack Hinson and the people he interacted with in his daily life.
            While speaking with Tom in July 2017, I presented him with one of my new findings. It was during this conversation he suggested I call Scott Campbell at River Road Press. Tom took it one step further, making the introductory call himself. Within a few hours, I was speaking with the book publisher on the phone and in December 2017, I drove to New Orleans to meet Mr. Campbell in person. After our visit, I finally had someone who was willing to publish my first book, In The Hills Of Tennessee: The Uncivil War. The book will be in hardcover format, with over sixty black and white illustrations, and historic photos from the 1860’s. Twenty graphic art pieces completed by myself are also included, as well as six illustrations by renowned artist Andy Thomas. 
            At present, the scheduled release of the book is set for October 2018. Although River Road Press will be paying for all of the expenses to print the books (as well as supplying them in stores), I still have expenses that I must take on myself. As per industry standard, I will receive a case of 24 books free, but the rest of the inventory I must purchase to have product to sell at my book signings. I will also have to incur the cost of reproducing the full color prints of my artwork, the national marketing campaign, and the travel expenses to my book signings/shows. 
            This is the part that I am absolutely thrilled about. I am turning to family, friends, fellow history lovers, and art connoisseurs to help me get this project off the ground. I have chosen the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform to make it possible for everyone to get involved with this groundbreaking series about Captain Jack Hinson, a man history has yet to forget.  
            I hope to see each of you soon as the book tour comes to your hometown!

Why Should I Donate to This Campaign?
      The times we live in are undoubtedly frustrating and horrific. The thought police are on the rise. Political correctness and virtue signaling is all the rage. History is literally being attacked, and we should not allow for it to proceed any further! And all the while, the ones doing the berating are oblivious to the origin behind the events which actually transpired. 
Facts are being misconstrued and misrepresented.
The political climate is humid at best, and that is why this series is vital to this generation, and many more to come. History is being erased before us, and even though it's possible this series may not make a dent in the metaphorical barrel that is labeled ""NO FACTS, NO HISTORY"", this is a passionate effort to enlighten the minds of the misinformed, and provide those who are well-versed in the subject more information about the past, with hearty entertainment sprinkled in along the way.
Many vital steps need to be taken so we as a nation can make the corrections to history mainstream, as well as preserving the simplicity which magnifies the allure and beauty of the Civil War era. We believe donating to this campaign is not only one of said steps which could generate an open dialogue about the state of our country, but could furthermore spread awareness about the threat of history being eradicated from our lives.
The remembrance of our ancestors and all those who came before, and the great sacrifices they made so we could enjoy our liberties today, will all be in vain if we cannot find a way to stop this whirlwind of strife that has invaded our government, our schools, our churches, and even our homes.
 
 
New Information Found
There are also certain places and events which surround the Battle at Fort Donelson and Stewart County, TN, that have not been amended in an official capacity, but are spoken about in the series. It is our highest hope that we can present this new information to historical societies around the country so it can stand corrected!
 
 

What We Need & What You Get
     Funding received for this campaign will be going toward the nationwide book tour, set to kick off in October 2018, mere days proceeding the release of the first book in the Chronicles of Captain Jack Hinson series, In the Hills of Tennessee: The Uncivil War. It will also go toward the purchase of cases of books from the publisher, as well as money to use for the art prints.
The full budget is listed in the category below!
There have been tireless efforts to publish this series, and after a decade of hard work and dedication, Rick Revel finally wants to see his life's work come to fruition.
Being such a wide variation of art to choose from in the perks section, we assure you there's definitely something for every student of American History, Civil War enthusiast, or simply even a lover of graphic artwork!
 
The Budget
   As the project becomes a success, you will have bragging rights that you helped to get it all started! If you see the book mentioned in a nationally recognized magazine or online venues, we are willing to wager that your heart will swell with pride, knowing you were able to play a role in getting the ball rolling for this series!
 These are all approximate amounts estimated from Rick Revel's experience in the entertainment industry. No amount is set in stone and can be subject to change.

For every donation that fits within the perks guidelines, you will receive a full color print of my artwork. There are 15 different prints to choose from, so you can fill your home, office, or business with these historic graphic portraits! 
Purchasing 1,000 extra books, the cost will be $12,500.00
Purchasing 500 full color prints of artwork, the cost will be $12,500.00.
Advertising is a must, which will require placement in magazines and newspapers, and considering the times we live in, a large amount will go into ads for social media & internet sites. The minimum budget to get adequate coverage is $15,000.00.
There is also a tentative plan to produce a YouTube video trailer with actor portrayals, costing $5,000.00.
The travel expenses for the multi-city book tour will be approximately $5,000.00.

The total proposed budget is $50,000.00.

 
 
About the Book Series
   All Jack Hinson ever wanted was to be left alone, so that he and his family could live peacefully, but after his two sons were murdered by Union soldiers, all hell broke loose in the hills of Tennessee.    
To put this series into an unambiguous perspective, picture this: In The Hills Of Tennessee: The Uncivil War  has a Little House On The Prairie ambiance which is focused on the importance of familial devotion, but then when you mix in the seductive magnetism of Gone With The Wind, then top it off with the gunslingin’, horse-ridin', never-back-down attitude of The Outlaw Josey Wales? It is a near impossibility to not be elated reading this series, not to mention, being able to learn about American History in a satisfying way. These pieces of the past were buried for years and untold by historians and teachers alike, until now. 
 
 

Risks & Challenges


One of the largest risks involved in this project is not attaining the campaign goal. We are relying on you, the people, to propel this forward and spread the word about how important this series truly is in preserving the American spirit. Because once the budget is attained, we can go the rest of the way!

A possible challenge to overcome would be not having the ability to market the series enough for it to receive adequate coverage, which could heavily affect sales. We are going to put our ALL into pumping out the proper ads to audiences who want to see them.

Wrap your mind around this: We only need 1,000 people to donate $50 each in order to reach the proposed goal. In reality, that isn't a large number of people, but can be challenging for someone who has been out of the public arena for a good while.

This is <b>more</b> than that : this is me <b>fighting to live out a dream I've had ever since I was little. </b> I'm now 32 years old, and the dream is still there. Let me tell you why this campaign is <b>different to the rest. </b><p>I am <b>not</b> just anyone who decided to write a book just for something to do. Where others only <b>deign</b> to go, I <b>desire</b> to go. I am not the kind of person who has a dream and who does not persue it, or who gives up. </p><p>In November 2013, I entered NaNoWriMo and wrote my debut novel called Spellbrooke. Writing is a challenge for anyone, more so for me as I was born with <b>cerebral palsy</b> and <b>hydrocephalus</b> and am registered <b>legally blind.</b> </p><p>When I was born  on the 22nd December 1981 with my identical twin Natalie three months prematurely, I had lack of oxygen and was in the NICU for three months fighting for my life . I was on a ventilator for the first two weeks of my life , and so was my twin,  We both weighed 2lb 6oz.  I had a bilateral grade IV  (severe) brain bleed, jaundice, conjunctivitis and a whole host of other infections.  </p><p>Al mirar esto por la primera vez, puede que piensas 'otra campaña de alguien que busque publicar su novela' . Esto es <b>más</b> que eso: esta soy yo <b>luchando para vivir un sueño que tenia desde que era niña . </b>Ahora, tengo 32 años, y ese sueño que tenía sigue allí. <span style="""">  Dejad que te cuente por qué esta campaña es <b>diferente al resto. </b> <b>No</b> solo soy una persona que decidió escribir un libro por tener algo que hacer.   Donde los demás <b>no se atreven a ir</b>  yo <b>deseo</b> ir . No soy el tipo de persona que tiene un sueño y no lo persigue, o una persona que se rinde. </span></p><p><span style="""">En noviembre de 2013, participé en NaNoWriMo y escribí mi primera novela titulada Spellbrooke.  Escribir es un reto para todos pero especialmente para  mí porque naci con <b>paralisis cerebral </b>e<b> hidrocefalia y </b>estoy registrada<b> legalmente como  persona ciega . </b></span></p><p><span style="""">Cuando naci el dia 22 de diciembre   de 1981  junta a  mi hermana gemela Natalie Jane Hayward,  sufrí falta de oxigeno y pase tres meses en la UCI neonatal  luchando por mi vida.  Un ventilador me mantenia a mi y a mi gemela con vida. Yo pesaba 1 kilo 8 gramos . A causa de mi nacimiento  tenía una hemorragia cerebral de grado 4 (severa) en ambos lados de mi cabeza a la vez , ictericia, conjuncticitis y muchas mas infecciones. </span></p><p><b style="""">Cerebral Palsy</b><span style=""""> is a </span><b style="""">neurological disability </b><span style="""">where lack of oxygen to the brain  during, after or at birth causes brain damage. There  are many types of Cerebral Palsy, and mine is </span><b style="""">Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy </b><span style="""">which means my </span><b style="""">muscles</b><span style=""""> are </span><b style="""">overly stiff and rigid </b><span style="""">and this makes </span><b style="""">movement</b><span style=""""> difficult. The rigidness affects </span><b style="""">all</b><span style=""""> my muscles. </span><br/></p><p>As my cerebral palsy affects my <b>entire</b> body, I require help in <b>all</b> daily tasks which include washing, dressing and eating and whenever I am out I have to be accompanied by somebody as I have <b>very poor hand – eye coordination </b>and my <b>severe spatial awareness problems </b>mean that I cannot judge distance speed or depth. I have problems with my balance, and have specialist seating in my wheelchair which has positioning wedges and pads inside, and the backrest has moulded sides to support my body. This is what keeps me upright, and even then it is a <b>struggle to sit upright. </b></p><p>I <b>tire easily</b>, but do what I can during the day, and have a <b>happy</b> and <b>positive</b> demenour. </p><p>I also have deformities in my pelvis and hips and they are rotated at an angle so that my legs and feet turn  inwards. This also causes <b>pain and discomfort</b> on a daily basis. I have a lot of muscle spasms during the day which are very strong and worse when I am tired or when I experience strong emotions or changes in temperature.I cannot regulate my body temperature and have very bad circulation so my hands and feet are always cold and I feel the cold easily. . I have had <b>countless operations and hospital checkups </b>and am very lucky to be here today because I was given <b>NO CHANCE</b>  of survival by the doctors, and had to be revived on the third day of my life after suffering a heart attack, and was baptised in an emergency ceremony at hospital by the doctors and nurses in the NICU. My sister Natalie was given the same prognosis. </p><p><u><b>¿Qué es la Parálisis Cerebral?</b></u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/579617/files/20140514121116-image.jpg?1400094676"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><u><b>Aquí Puedes Averiguar Qué es la Parálisis Cerebral y Te Contaré con Gusto Para Que Llegas A Entender Más Sobre Mi Discapacidad Y  Podrás Ver Por Qué El Sueño Que Tengo De Ser Una Autora Y Publicar Un Libro No  Es Cosa Fácil Para Que Luchar . </b></u></p><p><u><b>A Pesar de Eso No Me Rendiré. </b></u></p><p>La <b>parálisis cerebral </b>es una <b> discapacidad neurológica </b>en la cual la  falta de oxigeno al cerebro antes , durante o después del parto causa <b>daño cerebral. </b></p><p>Hay varios tipos de paralisis cerebral y el mio es<b>  la Parálisis Cerebral Tetraplejia Espástica, </b>que significa que mis músculos son demasiado<b> tiesos y rígidos, </b>y esto hace que el <b>movimiento me sea difícil.   </b>La rigidez afecta a <b>todos mis músculos.  </b></p><p>Como la parálisis cerebral afecta a <b>todos</b> mis músculos,  requiero ayuda en <b>todas</b> las tareas de la vida diaria incluso vestirse, asearse y comer, y cuando salgo afuera, tengo que ser acompañada debido a mi  <b>coordinación ojo-mano, que es muy mala. </b>Mis<b> </b>problemas severas de conciencia y percepción del espacio significan que no puedo medir la distancia, la velocidad y la profundidad.

</p><p><b>CHAPTER
ONE</b></p>
<p><b>It was the last day of
school before the summer holiday, and Casey’s mother Carrie was getting her
ready for school. Casey, age nine, attended special school in Meadowtown,
Oxfordshire, where the family decided to live after having lived in
London.  Casey and her younger brother,
Nick, had to move school and make new friends, and had experienced many
changes  in their short lives. The
family,  who used to live in a ground floor apartment
in a modern apartment block in London, got fed up of the city,  and decided to move to a more rural
location.<br/>
Carrie Ford, a thin woman with straight brown hair down to her shoulders and
pale  blue eyes, looked  through her daughter’s drawers.<br/>
‘It’s a special day today Casey,’ she said. <br/>
‘What do you want to wear then?’ <br/>
Casey, who looked identical to her mother, but who wore glasses, looked up at
her mother and said.<br/>
 ‘My purple dress’ - purple was her
favourite colour - ‘and my white sandals’. <br/>
As the day was warm, the purple dress and white sandals were a great choice.
The sandals were special ones that supported Casey’s feet well.  Casey needed to wear special sandals and
shoes, as her hips were dislocated and her feet turned in due to the cerebral
palsy she was born with.  She loved
wearing pretty clothes, as any little girl does, and her bedroom was  full of pretty things.  It was painted a lilac colour, and had
stencils of horses on the walls. Casey’s mum lifted her daughter into her
electric wheelchair using the electric hoist, an electric lifter which had a
soft harness instead of a seat  attached
to it. It was on rails that were built into the ceiling in Casey’s bedroom and
her bathroom, as it was the easiest, and safest, way of moving Casey from one place
to another without her parents having to lift her as she could not stand up or
walk because of her disability, When she was ready they went to have breakfast
with the rest of the family before the school bus arrived.<br/>
 The sun shone into the kitchen, and they saw that Casey’s father John,
and her brother,  Nick, were already
sitting at the table. <br/>
‘Good morning Carrie, good morning Casey’ said John, kissing them both.  <br/>
John was a tall, thin  man with wavy
brown hair and blue eyes. He was reading the Business section of the newspaper
as usual, as he worked in nearby Linton as an architect, and needed to keep up
with what was going on in his type of work. 
<br/>
‘Hi Mum, Hi Casey’ said Nick. <br/>
‘Good morning Nick, darling’ said Carrie, as she kissed her son. <br/>
‘Hi Nick’ said Casey, and they began eating their breakfast. <br/>
Carrie only had time for a quick breakfast herself, but also found time to help
her daughter with eating meals.  Casey’s
coordination wasn’t good, and this made eating difficult for her. Casey had to
take medication with her meals. Her medication were tablets called Baclofen,
which helped relax her muscles, and Carrie had been told by Casey’s doctor and
at the chemist that they were best taken with a milky drink, as the milk would
protect Casey’s stomach. That was alright, as Casey loved drinks such as hot
chocolate for breakfast. The occupational therapist, a lady who was in charge
of helping Casey have equipment that helped her do things better, even if it
was with help,  had assessed Casey and
suggested a cup with a lid and a hole for a straw, so she could drink more
easily, and that cup was on the table now. <br/>
 Carrie looked at her watch and turned to
her husband. <br/>
‘Help Casey finish off breakfast please darling, I don’t want to be  late, not on the last day.’ <br/>
Casey’s mum was a teacher at Casey’s school, Greenacres Special School, and
since her daughter was born nine years ago, she hadn’t left her side. <br/>
‘I will’ he said,  and took the spoon
from his wife’s hand. <br/>
Both Casey and her brother were eating Coco Pops, and her dad was eating
Shredded Wheat. The kettle was starting to boil, and he asked his children what
they wanted to drink.  They both had
orange juice, and he served himself some tea in his trademark mug with a
picture of a house on. <br/>
He was an architect at the big company, 
Smiths, which specialised in architecture and home decor. Instead of
buying a house that was already built, he had bought land and got his
colleagues to build their house from scratch, based on plans he had drawn.  <br/>
This was always a dream of his, to build his own home for his family. It was
much better for Casey and Nick than the London apartment they’d lived in,
which, although spacious and big enough for them, it wasn’t to be their home
forever, as they wanted to have a proper family home with even more space and a
bigger garden. <br/>
This house had it all.  It was a large,
detached house built, like many older buildings in Oxford and Oxfordshire, with
Cotswold stone. The sand-coloured bricks were more traditional and looked
better in this area than red bricks, he thought, and he and his colleagues had
planned the house very carefully, as he wanted his family to have the house
they deserved, and he had managed to give them just that. <br/>
He gave himself a mental pat on the back as he sipped his tea, and helped his
daughter finish her cereal. They ate some muffins, and then it was time for his
seven -year-old son, Nick, to brush his teeth and be off to school. <br/>
‘Bye Nick’ said Carrie, John and Casey as Nick got up from the table to go and
get his schoolbag.<br/>
 ‘Bye Dad’ answered Nick. ‘Bye Mum’ ‘Bye
Casey.’ <br/>
A few minutes later, they heard the front door close and he was gone.  Nick walked to his friend Tom’s house and
they went to school together from there. <br/>
John always waited with Casey for the school minibus, which came to the house
to collect her.  It was still 8; 30
AM.  It usually arrived at around 9 AM. .<br/>
 He took her to her own  bathroom, a large wet - room with an adapted
toilet, which had a higher seat than a usual toilet, and a bar on the wall on
either side of it for Casey´s safety. There was also an open shower area, and a
bathtub with a bath lift. The bathroom was right next to her bedroom.  Next, he found her schoolbag, a rucksack
(which was also purple). <br/>
By the time that was done, they heard a ring on the door bell. John opened the
door and saw Sophie, one of the school’s care workers. Sophie had black hair
almost to her waist and was Casey’s helper on the bus. <br/>
Sophie took Casey’s rucksack from John with a ‘thanks John’ and put Casey’s
wheelchair on manual to be able to push it down the shallow slope from the
front door. <br/>
The green minibus had been paid for by the local Council, and had an electric
lift at the back for wheelchairs.  <br/>
The driver, Bill, came round to the back of the bus and  pressed the round red button on the side of
the lift to make it reach the ground. He was a kind man in his fifties, with
brown hair and glasses, who used to be an ambulance driver.  <br/>
As the lift whirred to the ground, he asked Casey and Sophie,  <br/>
‘Ready for the last day of school?’<br/>
 ‘Yes’, they both said. Sophie
stepped onto the tail lift, which was big enough for two people, and held onto
the side of Casey’s wheelchair for balance. It wasn’t long until the tail lift
reached the level with the opening of the back of the minibus, and they were
both safely inside. The minibus was spacious so as to be able to fit people in
electric wheelchairs in, and Sophie helped Bill secure Casey’s  wheelchair to the floor of the minibus with
hooks and straps after they had put her seat belt on, as every carer and mini
bus driver was fully trained beforehand to take extra special care when making
the children safe to travel in their wheelchairs. <br/>
Not all of the children were in wheelchairs, but those who were were secured
like this. After one last, gentle tug to make sure that the wheelchair was
safe, Sophie herself sat in the seat next to Casey’s wheelchair and fastened
her seat belt. Bill returned to the front of the bus. Sophie put her hand in
Casey’s, as she knew that Casey got a bit nervous when travelling, even on the
short fifteen minute journey from the Ford house to Greenacres Special School,
as she didn’t like the  movement of the
bus as it made her feel dizzy despite the way her wheelchair was tied down.
Casey’s balance was affected by her cerebral palsy, and she had a harness to
secure her into the wheelchair which she wore all the time, not just when
travelling.<br/>
Casey looked around: the bus was almost full by the time it got to her house,
and she spotted her best friend, Rachel. <br/>
‘Hi, Rachel!’ she said, <br/>
‘Hi Casey’ replied Rachel, <br/>
Rachel Brown was the same age as Casey, and had long blonde hair and blue eyes.
She was wearing a red jacket and jeans. She  sat in
a manual wheelchair and also had cerebral palsy. Casey and Rachel had
known each other for years, and their mums were best friends. They chatted
excitedly about what they were going to do at school that day, </b><br/><b>
Casey’s favourite thing to do at school was read, and Rachel’s was, too. They
were both top of the class in reading, and they had learnt to read quickly.
Today was the end of term Book Fair, and they were both looking forward to
having a new book to read for the holidays. </b><br/><b>
Just then, the bus pulled up to the school gates and Bill parked it in the
reserved parking space. He pushed the button to open the doors at the back of
the bus,  and put the lift down, so that
the children and the carers could get off the bus. Everybody crossed the car
park and went through the automatic doors into the building. </b><br/><b>
The fist person Casey and Rachel saw, unfortunately, was Angela, a thin girl
with blonde curly hair, who was with her dark–haired friend, Kelly, and was a
real bully.  Angela turned her wheelchair
towards them, and said ‘so, who’s here today then? Maybe you’ll both finally
learn something seeing as it’s the last day!’ </b><br/><b>
Sophie said ‘Angela, you’d better get to class too, don’t you think?’ </b><br/><b>
 ‘Go away, Angela’, Casey and Rachel
said. They hoped she wouldn’t bother them for the rest of the day. </b><br/><b>
Greenacres Special School was a modern and spacious building, and was built
only five years ago. It was a long, red brick building all on one level, and
had ramps coming out of various doors. For Carrie and John Ford, it seemed the
best choice for their daughter when they were choosing which school she’d go
to, as since being built it had been awarded 
‘excellent’ in all of its OFSTED reports. They wanted Casey to get
the best support possible in her classes. </b><br/><b>
The school was named after the huge area of land it was built on, and had its
own outdoor swimming pool, as well as indoor hydrotherapy pool, rooms for
physical and occupational therapy, and a sensory room. All the rooms had
electric doors, and were big enough for a whole class of children in
wheelchairs. </b><br/><b>
The teachers had hung the children’s’ paintings, artwork and stories on the
walls, which were painted bright colours. There was the reading area in one
corner, which had shelves full of books, and looked like  a mini library, and all the desks were large
enough for any type of wheelchair to fit underneath, and could be changed  in both height and angle. Casey’s and
Rachel’s desks were side-by-side.</b><br/><b>
All the children came into the class. In total, there were fifteen students in
Casey’s class, and there were four assistants. Some of the children had their
own personal assistants, like Casey did. Their teacher, Miss Honeysuckle, was
twenty five years old, but despite that had lots of experience working with
children with disabilities.  She sat at
her desk and filled out the register for the day. Everybody was in the class
today. She welcomed them and began the class.</b><br/><b>
The day consisted of using the sensory room, music, some reading and then it
was lunchtime. Diane, a tall woman with short red hair who was Casey’s
classroom assistant, accompanied her to the canteen, which was a large room
with the same tables as the classrooms. </b><br/><b>
She got Casey’s  square purple lunchbox
out of her rucksack, then opened the door and said ‘it’s a lovely day’.</b><br/><b>
When they saw the sunshine, Casey asked</b><br/><b>
 ‘Can we eat outside? I want to eat
outside!’ </b><br/><b>
‘Yes, me too’ said Rachel. </b><br/><b>
‘All right  girls, let’s go outside!’
said Diane, and opened the door wider to help Casey through.  Rachel followed. They went down the ramp and
then found a large paved area by some trees. It was not very busy, so Casey,
Diane, Rachel and Rachel’s assistant Jackie had their lunch there. 
Then, suddenly, Angela appeared again, and ran her wheelchair into
Rachel’s. </b><br/><b>
 ‘Be careful’, warned Diane, and Jackie. </b><br/><b>
‘I can see the stupid girls are back’, said Amanda, ‘I hope you learn something
on your last day’.</b><br/><b>
 ‘Ignore her’, said the carers. When they
had finished, they went back into the school building and back into
class. </b><br/><b>
Miss Honeysuckle told them that the Book Fair had just arrived, and that they
would go and have a look at the books. 
Casey and Rachel had beaming smiles on their faces when they heard this,
and wanted to be the first in line to go. A few minutes later, the entire class
was making its way into the school hall, where the Book Fair was held. A lot of
the books were aimed at children with disabilities, for example, there were
Braille books and large print books as well as books that could be used with e
book readers. There were also some books for adults. Casey bought </b><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Lion
the Witch and the Wardrobe </i><b>by CS Lewis, and Rachel bought a book of fairy
stories. Whilst at the Book Fair, Casey even saw her mum, who taught people
younger than Casey and Rachel. Miss Honeysuckle was busy looking at books for
her class when she saw Casey’s mum, Carrie. 
</b><br/><b>
‘Carrie’ she called, ‘over here.’ </b><br/><b>
Carrie Ford walked over to where she was standing. Ella Honeysuckle said
quietly, so as not to be overheard by the children ‘come to my classroom later,
I have a surprise up my sleeve for the children - in fact, it’s a kind of
end-of-term party’.  </b><br/><b>
‘Very interesting’ said Carrie. ‘I’ll be there in ten minutes. </b><br/><b>
’When the Book Fair ended, she felt excitement for the children.</b><br/><b>
 She led her own class back to their
classroom. As her class of seven-year-olds put their books and rucksacks away
with the help of their assistants, she told them that they were going to see
Miss Honeysuckle’s class and off they went. </b><br/><b>
As they reached her classroom door, Carrie knocked on it,  and was greeted by the sight of tables with
food and drink on and the classroom was decorated with streamers in different
bright colours, blue, pink, green and yellow.  There was even a banner
with ‘HAPPY SUMMER HOLIDAYS!’ written
on it, which Miss Honeysuckle herself had made. 
The children had a great  time at
the party, and then it was time to go home.   Miss Honeysuckle stopped the
party at half past two, half an hour earlier than the school day usually ended,
and said ‘and now, children, it’s time for the summer holidays!’</b><br/><b>
The children who had Personal Assistants were helped to get ready by them,
whilst the other class assistants helped clear the tables from the party and
leave the classroom tidier than it was. 
The children were smiling and happy. They were all really excited to
have time off school for the summer. 
Miss Honeysuckle cleared the rest of the food away. Because Casey’s
mother was a teacher and worked at the school, she would be allowed to take
some of the food home, but she didn’t know it yet. </b><br/><b>
Miss Honeysuckle took Casey’s mother and a classroom Assistant of hers
called  Trisha, a black- haired
twenty-year-old, and whispered ‘help me bring all this food and drink back to
the Staffroom’, waving her hand towards 
the leftover food and drinks. Between them, they did.</b><br/><b>
The Staffroom was at the opposite end of the building. They opened the red
door  and some of the other teachers
looked at them, wondering why they had the food and drink in their hands. They
asked what they did to celebrate the end of term. When Ella and Carrie told
them about the party, many teachers thought it was a good idea, and secretly
promised themselves they’d be more imaginative next time.  </b><br/><b>
Miss Honeysuckle and Carrie put the food on the table. ‘Help yourselves’, said
Trisha. There were smiles and low giggles as some teachers did just that, some
snacking on what was left of the bags of crisps, cakes, party sausages, sausage
rolls and caffeine-free soft drinks. </b><br/><b>
 Georgina, a teacher who’d just arrived
from, Boston, suggested sharing the food out amongst them.  All the teachers agreed this was a good idea,
as many of the teachers had children themselves, and so the food would get
eaten and not be wasted, Maggie, an Occupational Therapist, found some carrier
bags in a nearby storage cupboard, and all the teachers started sharing the
leftovers between them. There were two male teachers at the school: Ian
Wainwright and David Smith. They were both very tall, with black hair and blue
eyes.  David was eating a sausage roll
and chatting to Ian. </b><br/><b>
‘It’s great we have some time off work now’ he said.  </b><br/><b>
‘Yes it really is’ answered Ian. </b><br/><b>
The door opened just at that moment, and Emily Pryor, the Headmistress walked
in. Emily had long, curly red hair and brown eyes. She was petite, thin and very
bubbly. All the teachers at Greenacres Special School agreed she was the best
headmistress they’d had so far, and the school had flourished in the four years
she’d been in command.  In a way, it was
truly ‘her’ school. </b><br/><b>
‘Having fun?’  she asked them.  </b><br/><b>
All the teachers laughed. She remembered then that she had one last surprise
for the term: she went to her locker, opened it, and took out a  bag of hand-painted  wooden photo frames. She had a real talent
for art and crafts, and had made one for each teacher. They were individually
decorated to reflect the personality of each member of her staff. She passed
them round. Each was wrapped in tissue paper the same colour as the frame
inside it. </b><br/><b>
Carrie opened the pale yellow tissue paper surrounding hers. The frame   had
yellow sunflowers on it and, in curly painted letters, it said ‘sunny’ </b><br/><b>
‘Aww thanks so much’ she said. </b><br/><b>
 Then, she found a Tupperware container
in the small kitchen area of the Staffroom, and put some sausage rolls, inside
before she closed the bright red lid. She also took some crisps, six cans of
Lemon Fanta and Sprite and a bottle of caffeine-free-Coke. </b><br/><b>
She looked at her Dolce and Gabbana watch, which John had given her last
Christmas, and said ‘right, I’d better go and get Casey.’</b><br/><b>
The teachers said their goodbyes, and she left the Staffroom. </b><br/><b>
When she got back to the classroom, Casey was ready and waiting in her summer
coat and Diane was by her side.</b><br/><b>
 Diane gave her a hug, and said. ‘I’ll
accompany you outside.’</b><br/><b>
 She did. The school minibus was there,
Bill was waiting. </b><br/><b>
Suddenly, Carrie said ‘Bill, Casey’s coming with me.’  </b><br/><b>
Casey said ‘why aren’t I going on the bus, Mum?’</b><br/><b>
Carrie explained  ‘I have the van with
me’.</b><br/><b>
 She’d gone home in her lunch hour, left
her car, and driven back to the school with the family’s adapted van. </b><br/><b>
Casey’s face broke into a grin. ‘Thanks, Mum’ she said. </b><br/><b>
The van was a great help for getting Casey around. It was a silver Fiat van
which the family had bought years ago. Carrie opened the passenger door and put
her black handbag on the seat,  and then
opened the sliding door to put the carrier bags on one of the seats so she had
her hands free to help her daughter. She pulled the ramp down, pulling the
straps tight on each side of the ramp to create a safety barrier so it would be
safer when they went up the ramp.</b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">To see more, visit my blog <a href=""http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.es/2014/05/i-love-writing.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style="""">http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.es</a></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Para ver más, visite mi blog  <a href=""http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.es/2014/05/i-love-writing.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style="""">http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.es</a></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""""><b><br/></b></span></p><p><span style=""""><b><br/></b></span></p><p><span style=""""><b><br/></b></span></p><p><br/></p>

I am not the kind of person who has a dream and who does not persue it, or who gives up. In November 2013, I entered NaNoWriMo and wrote my debut novel called Spellbrooke. Writing is a challenge for anyone, more so for me as I was born with cerebral palsy and hydrocephalus and am registered legally blind. When I was born  on the 22nd December 1981 with my identical twin Natalie three months prematurely, I had lack of oxygen and was in the NICU for three months fighting for my life . I was on a ventilator for the first two weeks of my life , and so was my twin,  We both weighed 2lb 6oz.  I had a bilateral grade IV  (severe) brain bleed, jaundice, conjunctivitis and a whole host of other infections.  Al mirar esto por la primera vez, puede que piensas 'otra campaña de alguien que busque publicar su novela' . Esto es más que eso: esta soy yo luchando para vivir un sueño que tenia desde que era niña . Ahora, tengo 32 años, y ese sueño que tenía sigue allí.   Dejad que te cuente por qué esta campaña es diferente al resto.  No solo soy una persona que decidió escribir un libro por tener algo que hacer.   Donde los demás no se atreven a ir  yo deseo ir . No soy el tipo de persona que tiene un sueño y no lo persigue, o una persona que se rinde. En noviembre de 2013, participé en NaNoWriMo y escribí mi primera novela titulada Spellbrooke.  Escribir es un reto para todos pero especialmente para  mí porque naci con paralisis cerebral e hidrocefalia y estoy registrada legalmente como  persona ciega . Cuando naci el dia 22 de diciembre   de 1981  junta a  mi hermana gemela Natalie Jane Hayward,  sufrí falta de oxigeno y pase tres meses en la UCI neonatal  luchando por mi vida.  Un ventilador me mantenia a mi y a mi gemela con vida. Yo pesaba 1 kilo 8 gramos . A causa de mi nacimiento  tenía una hemorragia cerebral de grado 4 (severa) en ambos lados de mi cabeza a la vez , ictericia, conjuncticitis y muchas mas infecciones. Cerebral Palsy is a neurological disability where lack of oxygen to the brain  during, after or at birth causes brain damage. There  are many types of Cerebral Palsy, and mine is Spastic Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy which means my muscles are overly stiff and rigid and this makes movement difficult. The rigidness affects all my muscles. As my cerebral palsy affects my entire body, I require help in all daily tasks which include washing, dressing and eating and whenever I am out I have to be accompanied by somebody as I have very poor hand – eye coordination and my severe spatial awareness problems mean that I cannot judge distance speed or depth. I have problems with my balance, and have specialist seating in my wheelchair which has positioning wedges and pads inside, and the backrest has moulded sides to support my body. This is what keeps me upright, and even then it is a struggle to sit upright. I tire easily, but do what I can during the day, and have a happy and positive demenour. I also have deformities in my pelvis and hips and they are rotated at an angle so that my legs and feet turn  inwards. This also causes pain and discomfort on a daily basis. I have a lot of muscle spasms during the day which are very strong and worse when I am tired or when I experience strong emotions or changes in temperature.I cannot regulate my body temperature and have very bad circulation so my hands and feet are always cold and I feel the cold easily. . I have had countless operations and hospital checkups and am very lucky to be here today because I was given NO CHANCE  of survival by the doctors, and had to be revived on the third day of my life after suffering a heart attack, and was baptised in an emergency ceremony at hospital by the doctors and nurses in the NICU. My sister Natalie was given the same prognosis. ¿Qué es la Parálisis Cerebral?Aquí Puedes Averiguar Qué es la Parálisis Cerebral y Te Contaré con Gusto Para Que Llegas A Entender Más Sobre Mi Discapacidad Y  Podrás Ver Por Qué El Sueño Que Tengo De Ser Una Autora Y Publicar Un Libro No  Es Cosa Fácil Para Que Luchar . A Pesar de Eso No Me Rendiré. La parálisis cerebral es una  discapacidad neurológica en la cual la  falta de oxigeno al cerebro antes , durante o después del parto causa daño cerebral. Hay varios tipos de paralisis cerebral y el mio es  la Parálisis Cerebral Tetraplejia Espástica, que significa que mis músculos son demasiado tiesos y rígidos, y esto hace que el movimiento me sea difícil.   La rigidez afecta a todos mis músculos.  Como la parálisis cerebral afecta a todos mis músculos,  requiero ayuda en todas las tareas de la vida diaria incluso vestirse, asearse y comer, y cuando salgo afuera, tengo que ser acompañada debido a mi  coordinación ojo-mano, que es muy mala. Mis problemas severas de conciencia y percepción del espacio significan que no puedo medir la distancia, la velocidad y la profundidad. Tengo problemas de equilibrio, y tengo un asiento y respaldo especial en mi silla de ruedas , que tiene cuñas de posicionamiento dentro del respaldo y el cojín, y el respaldo tiene soportes laterales incorporados.Aún así me dificulta estar sentada durante mucho tiempo.   Me canso con facilidad y hago lo que puedo durante  el día . Tengo una actitiud positiva hacia la vida,  y soy una persona feliz. También tengo deformidades en mi pelvis y caderas, al igual que mis piernas y  mis pies. Esto también provoca dolor y malestar diarios  Tengo un montón de espasmos musculares durante el día que son muy fuertes , y son  peores  cuando estoy cansada o cuando yo experimento emociones fuertes o  hay cambios muy bruscos  en el tiempo . No puedo regular mi temperatura corporal y tengo  muy mala circulación. Mis  manos y mis pies siempre estan    fríos  y me siento el frío con facilidad. He tenido innumerables operaciones y  pruebas en el  hospital ,  y estoy muy orgullosa de estar aquí  hoy , porque  los medicos no me daban  NINGUNA POSIBILIDAD de sobrevivir y tuve que ser reanimada en el tercer día de mi vida después de sufrir un ataque al corazón, y fue bautizado en la ceremonia de emergencia en el hospital por los médicos y las enfermeras en la UCIN. Mi hermana Natalie  tenia el mismo pronóstico. Hydrocephalus is a neurological disability in which, due to  brain injury (in my case, the severe bleeding inside my brain) the levels of cerebrospinal fluid, which protects the brain and spinal cord,  are so high they cause the brain  and skull to swell .  I was lucky in that I was operated on quickly when I was two weeks old . This was an extremely risky operation as I was so small and premature. The operation was to put a drainage system called a shunt inside my brain to drain off the excess fluid. The drainage system is a pressure valve attached to a  catheter (tube)  that goes into my abdomen. Just because I have this, it doesn't mean my hydrocephalus is cured or that it has disappeared, it hasn't. In fact, there is NO CURE  for either of my disabilities. My hydrocephalus is said to be controlled because of the shunt, but it is like a ticking timebomb because whenever I have a headache nausea or vomiting, it could mean that the shunt is fractured or blocked and I would have to be operated on immediately. If not, the consequences could be fatal.  I get frequent  headaches and pains in my head around the area where the shunt is , and due to all the operations the sensitivity in my head has changed, so a daily task like having my hair washed or  brushed is more like a time of discomfort than pleasure for me, as my head is very sensitive to touch¿Que es la Hidrocefalia?  La Hidrocefalia Es  La Otra Discapacidad  Que  Tengo. Esta Sección  Explica  Más Sobre  La Hidrocefalia .  Esta Es Una Discapacidad Que  Las Personas  No Saben Que  Tengo Porque  No Es Visible La hidrocefalia es una  discapacidad de origen neurológica  en la ual, debido a una lesión cerebral (en mi caso, la severa hemorragia dentro de mi cerebro) los niveles de fluido cerebroespinal, que protegen el cerebro y la columna vertebral , son tan altos que causan el cerebro y el cráneo a hincharse. He tenido suerte en que fui intervenida rápidamente cuando sólo tenía dos semanas de vida. Fue una operación muy arriesgada porque yo era muy pequeña y prematura. La operación fue  para  poner un sistema de drenaje llamado una  válvula de derivación  dentro de mi cerebro para drenar el exceso de líquido cefaliraquideo    El sistema de drenaje es una válvula de presión conectada a un catéter (sonda) que se adentra en mi abdomen. Sólo porque tengo esto, no significa mi hidrocefalia este  curada o que haya desaparecido, no lo ha hecho. De hecho, NO hay cura para ninguna de mi discapacidades. Mi hidrocefalia se dice que esta controlado debido a la desviación, pero es como una bomba de relojería  porque  cada  vez que tengo  náuseas,  dolor de cabeza o vómitos, puede significar que la válvula de derivacion este      fracturada o bloqueada y que tendría que ser operada inmediatamente. Si no, las consecuencias podrían ser fatales. Tengo frecuentes dolores de cabeza y en mi cabeza alrededor del área donde está la desviación y debido a todas las operaciones, me  ha cambiado la sensibilidad en la cabeza, así que una tarea diaria como que alguien me lave o cepille  mi cabello es más como un momento de malestar que placer para mí, mi cabeza es muy sensible al tacto. My eyesight difficulties are nystagmus, which is a constant, uncontrolled side – to – side eye movement associated with cerebral palsy , squint in both eyes, tunnel vision and an eye condition called hemianopsia where my visual field is severely restricted because I have blindness in one half of both eyes, and so I'm working with the equivalent of one eye with very restricted eyesight doing the work of two which has always caused me a lot of difficulty focusing my eyes, eyestrain, very bad headaches and dizziness, even though I am sitting down.As as a result of all of these eye conditions due to my cerebral palsy,  and hydrocephalus , am registered legally blind. I have relied on glasses my whole life but they do not correct my vision and I am only able to see a very small amount despite the highly specialist, strong lenses I have. I rely on an electric wheelchair to get around. The tightness of my muscles causes them to cramp easily and I have muscle spasms for which I have to take daily medication. These spasms are also very painful.I have had my fair share of stares, insults and endured constant bullying during my school years.  People   have doubted and criticised   me,  and still do, but that has never stopped me, and never will . I am a person who's grown from not confident at all to believing in myself throughout the course of my life so far. After a difficult entry into the world I have always strived to fight for what I believed in, whether or not others thought I'd achieve it or not , and I am happy with what I have achieved up til now, but always look for new challenges, goals and dreams to persue. I am engaged to my fiancée , Luis Alfredo Pérez Soto and have been for the past eight years now.  Having someone by my side who loves me for who I am and  who believes  in me is another dream come true, which I'm so grateful I've achieved. ¿Cuales Son Mis Dificultades Visuales?  En Esta Sección  Aprenderás  Sobre  Las Dificultades  Visuales  Que Tengo. Debido  A Mis Discapacidades. Estoy Registrada Como Persona  Ciega. Por Favor, Comparte  Un Lazo  Blanco Para Las Personas  Ciegas Y Los Con Vista  Parcial. Las dificultades que tengo en la vista son  nistagmo, que es un movimiento  constante e incontrolable de  mis ojos de un lado a otro  y estos movimientos oculares estan  asociados con la parálisis cerebral. Tambien tengo estrabismo ambos   ojos, visión de túnel y una afección ocular llamada hemianopsia donde mi campo visual está severamente restringido porque tengo ceguera en la  mitad de ambos ojos y así estoy trabajando con el equivalente de un ojo con una vista muy restringida haciendo el trabajo de los dos que  siempre me causó mucha dificultad para enfocar los ojos, ademas de vista cansada, muy fuertes dolores de cabeza y mareos, aun cuando estoy sentada. Como consecuencia de todas estas condiciones de la vista  debido a mi parálisis cerebral y la hidrocefalia, estoy registrada como una persona ciega. Toda mi vida he llevado gafas pero no corrigen mi visión y sólo soy capaz de ver una cantidad muy pequeña a pesar de las lentes fuertes que tengo. Dependo de una silla de ruedas eléctrica para desplazarme. La tirantez de mis músculos facilmente provoca  calambres,   y tengo espasmos musculares para los que tengo que tomar medicación diaria. Estos espasmos son también muy dolorosos.A lo largo de los años que estaba en la escuela y el Instituto,  experimente bastantes miradas, insultos y acoso constante. Las personas  dudadaron de mi  y me criticaron, y todavía lo hacen, pero eso nunca me ha hecho rendirme en la vida ,  y nunca lo hará.Soy una persona que , con el paso de los años, ha  mudurado, y mi actitud ha cambiado. He ido desde aun persona que no tenia confianza en si misma  a creer en mí misma durante el transcurso de mi vida hasta ahora. Después de una entrada difícil en el mundo , siempre me he esforzado por luchar por lo que yo creía,  y no  me afecto si otros pensaron podría lograr las cosas o no, y estoy contenta con lo que he logrado hasta hasta ahora, pero siempre busco nuevos retos, metas y sueños que perseguir.  Estoy  comprometida con   Luis Alfredo Pérez Soto,  y hemos estado juntos  durante los últimos ocho años ahora. Tener a alguien a mi lado que me ama  por quién  soy y que cree en mí es otro sueño hecho realidad, que estoy tan agradecida de  haber logrado. Despite my complex and severe disabilities , I have achieved  more than anybody thought I would in life.I have no hearing problem (in fact , my hearing has been made better because of my lack of eyesight) I am able to talk, I can in fact , speak fluent Spanish. I have a university degree in human geography from the University of Reading (UK) which I gained in 2004. I did not get that single-handedly- I was constantly helped at university by carers and support workers,  and had to have someone writing for me in my classes as I couldn't keep up. I passed all my exams,  with extra time , enlarged exam papers so I could see them, and very frequent rest breaks.My education was a mixture  of special education and mainstream school, but mainstream school with a full-time special needs assistant by my side at all times.Mis Retos Y Logros En La Vida A pesar de mis discapacidades  graves y complejas, he logrado más de lo que nadie creía que lo haría en la vida.No tengo ningún problema de audición (de hecho, la audiencia se hizo mejor por mi falta de visión) soy capaz de hablar, de hecho, puedo hablar español con fluidez.Tengo una licenciatura en geografía humana de la Universidad de Reading (Reino Unido) que gané en 2004. No  lo consiguí por  yo sola  - constantemente fui ayudada en la Universidad por  cuidadores y trabajadores y tuve que  tener alguien escribiendo para mí en mis clases como  yo no podía . Aprobé todos mis  exámenes, y tenia tiempo extra para completarlos y mis profesores y cuidadora agrandaron los papeles y la letra de los  exámenes para que yo podía  verlos,mejor,    y tenia tiempos de descanso muy frecuentes. Mi educación fue una mezcla de educación especial y escuela ordinaria, pero la escuela ordinaria con un asistente para gente con  necesidades especiales a tiempo completo  a mi lado en todo momento. My Disability Awareness Work In 2012, inspired  by the disability awareness movement and the need to tell my story, I started doing disability awareness work using  Facebook, and have created a page called Katherine Hayward my life with cerebral palsy. Around the same time I also started making videos on YouTube  (www.youtube.com/user/cpchick81 ) about my life, and they can be found in the links in the Gallery section of  this page. I do not know much about the very short life (nine days from birth ) of my identical twin sister, but I have a page dedicated to her on Facebook and that link is also on this page.As part of my disabilities, I   cannot type and so use a speech recognition programme to use the computer.  The  National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) challenge was to write a 50,000 word novel in a month and I DID   on the 18th of November  2013 with time to spare until the end of the month. Writing my book was a real learning curve ! - I'm glad I was able to do it before my 31 st birthday as that was a great gift for me! Mi Trabajo De Concienciación  De La Discapacidad.En 2012, inspirada en el movimiento de conciencia de personas con discapacidad y la necesidad de contar mi historia, comencé a hacer trabajo de conciencia  de la discapacidad usando Facebook,  y he creado una página llamada Katherine Hayward mi vida con parálisis cerebral. En la misma época también empecé a hacer videos en YouTube (www.youtube.com/ usuario/cpchick81) de mi vida, y se encuentran en los enlaces en la sección Galería de esta página.No sé mucho acerca de la vida muy corta (nueve días desde el nacimiento) de mi hermana gemela idéntica, pero tengo una página dedicada a ella en Facebook y ese vínculo  también se encuentra en esta página de campaña. Como parte de mi discapacidad, no puedo escribir, así que uso un programa de reconocimiento de voz para usar la computadora. El reto del mes Nacional de escritura de novela (NaNoWriMo) era escribir una novela de 50.000 palabras en un mes y LO HICE  el dia   18 de noviembre de 2013 con tiempo de sobra hasta el final del mes. ¡Escribir mi libro era una curva de aprendizaje real! -¡Me alegro de que yo era capaz de hacerlo antes de mi  31 cumpleaños, ya que  fue un gran regalo para mí!I am now at the publishing stage, but don't have the funds to fulfil my dream and publish my book as I want.

CHAPTER
ONE
It was the last day of
school before the summer holiday, and Casey’s mother Carrie was getting her
ready for school. Casey, age nine, attended special school in Meadowtown,
Oxfordshire, where the family decided to live after having lived in
London.  Casey and her younger brother,
Nick, had to move school and make new friends, and had experienced many
changes  in their short lives. The
family,  who used to live in a ground floor apartment
in a modern apartment block in London, got fed up of the city,  and decided to move to a more rural
location.
Carrie Ford, a thin woman with straight brown hair down to her shoulders and
pale  blue eyes, looked  through her daughter’s drawers.
‘It’s a special day today Casey,’ she said. 
‘What do you want to wear then?’ 
Casey, who looked identical to her mother, but who wore glasses, looked up at
her mother and said.
 ‘My purple dress’ - purple was her
favourite colour - ‘and my white sandals’. 
As the day was warm, the purple dress and white sandals were a great choice.
The sandals were special ones that supported Casey’s feet well.  Casey needed to wear special sandals and
shoes, as her hips were dislocated and her feet turned in due to the cerebral
palsy she was born with.  She loved
wearing pretty clothes, as any little girl does, and her bedroom was  full of pretty things.  It was painted a lilac colour, and had
stencils of horses on the walls. Casey’s mum lifted her daughter into her
electric wheelchair using the electric hoist, an electric lifter which had a
soft harness instead of a seat  attached
to it. It was on rails that were built into the ceiling in Casey’s bedroom and
her bathroom, as it was the easiest, and safest, way of moving Casey from one place
to another without her parents having to lift her as she could not stand up or
walk because of her disability, When she was ready they went to have breakfast
with the rest of the family before the school bus arrived.
 The sun shone into the kitchen, and they saw that Casey’s father John,
and her brother,  Nick, were already
sitting at the table. 
‘Good morning Carrie, good morning Casey’ said John, kissing them both.  
John was a tall, thin  man with wavy
brown hair and blue eyes. He was reading the Business section of the newspaper
as usual, as he worked in nearby Linton as an architect, and needed to keep up
with what was going on in his type of work. 

‘Hi Mum, Hi Casey’ said Nick. 
‘Good morning Nick, darling’ said Carrie, as she kissed her son. 
‘Hi Nick’ said Casey, and they began eating their breakfast. 
Carrie only had time for a quick breakfast herself, but also found time to help
her daughter with eating meals.  Casey’s
coordination wasn’t good, and this made eating difficult for her. Casey had to
take medication with her meals. Her medication were tablets called Baclofen,
which helped relax her muscles, and Carrie had been told by Casey’s doctor and
at the chemist that they were best taken with a milky drink, as the milk would
protect Casey’s stomach. That was alright, as Casey loved drinks such as hot
chocolate for breakfast. The occupational therapist, a lady who was in charge
of helping Casey have equipment that helped her do things better, even if it
was with help,  had assessed Casey and
suggested a cup with a lid and a hole for a straw, so she could drink more
easily, and that cup was on the table now. 
 Carrie looked at her watch and turned to
her husband. 
‘Help Casey finish off breakfast please darling, I don’t want to be  late, not on the last day.’ 
Casey’s mum was a teacher at Casey’s school, Greenacres Special School, and
since her daughter was born nine years ago, she hadn’t left her side. 
‘I will’ he said,  and took the spoon
from his wife’s hand. 
Both Casey and her brother were eating Coco Pops, and her dad was eating
Shredded Wheat. The kettle was starting to boil, and he asked his children what
they wanted to drink.  They both had
orange juice, and he served himself some tea in his trademark mug with a
picture of a house on. 
He was an architect at the big company, 
Smiths, which specialised in architecture and home decor. Instead of
buying a house that was already built, he had bought land and got his
colleagues to build their house from scratch, based on plans he had drawn.  
This was always a dream of his, to build his own home for his family. It was
much better for Casey and Nick than the London apartment they’d lived in,
which, although spacious and big enough for them, it wasn’t to be their home
forever, as they wanted to have a proper family home with even more space and a
bigger garden. 
This house had it all.  It was a large,
detached house built, like many older buildings in Oxford and Oxfordshire, with
Cotswold stone. The sand-coloured bricks were more traditional and looked
better in this area than red bricks, he thought, and he and his colleagues had
planned the house very carefully, as he wanted his family to have the house
they deserved, and he had managed to give them just that. 
He gave himself a mental pat on the back as he sipped his tea, and helped his
daughter finish her cereal. They ate some muffins, and then it was time for his
seven -year-old son, Nick, to brush his teeth and be off to school. 
‘Bye Nick’ said Carrie, John and Casey as Nick got up from the table to go and
get his schoolbag.
 ‘Bye Dad’ answered Nick. ‘Bye Mum’ ‘Bye
Casey.’ 
A few minutes later, they heard the front door close and he was gone.  Nick walked to his friend Tom’s house and
they went to school together from there. 
John always waited with Casey for the school minibus, which came to the house
to collect her.  It was still 8; 30
AM.  It usually arrived at around 9 AM. .
 He took her to her own  bathroom, a large wet - room with an adapted
toilet, which had a higher seat than a usual toilet, and a bar on the wall on
either side of it for Casey´s safety. There was also an open shower area, and a
bathtub with a bath lift. The bathroom was right next to her bedroom.  Next, he found her schoolbag, a rucksack
(which was also purple). 
By the time that was done, they heard a ring on the door bell. John opened the
door and saw Sophie, one of the school’s care workers. Sophie had black hair
almost to her waist and was Casey’s helper on the bus. 
Sophie took Casey’s rucksack from John with a ‘thanks John’ and put Casey’s
wheelchair on manual to be able to push it down the shallow slope from the
front door. 
The green minibus had been paid for by the local Council, and had an electric
lift at the back for wheelchairs.  
The driver, Bill, came round to the back of the bus and  pressed the round red button on the side of
the lift to make it reach the ground. He was a kind man in his fifties, with
brown hair and glasses, who used to be an ambulance driver.  
As the lift whirred to the ground, he asked Casey and Sophie,  
‘Ready for the last day of school?’
 ‘Yes’, they both said. Sophie
stepped onto the tail lift, which was big enough for two people, and held onto
the side of Casey’s wheelchair for balance. It wasn’t long until the tail lift
reached the level with the opening of the back of the minibus, and they were
both safely inside. The minibus was spacious so as to be able to fit people in
electric wheelchairs in, and Sophie helped Bill secure Casey’s  wheelchair to the floor of the minibus with
hooks and straps after they had put her seat belt on, as every carer and mini
bus driver was fully trained beforehand to take extra special care when making
the children safe to travel in their wheelchairs. 
Not all of the children were in wheelchairs, but those who were were secured
like this. After one last, gentle tug to make sure that the wheelchair was
safe, Sophie herself sat in the seat next to Casey’s wheelchair and fastened
her seat belt. Bill returned to the front of the bus. Sophie put her hand in
Casey’s, as she knew that Casey got a bit nervous when travelling, even on the
short fifteen minute journey from the Ford house to Greenacres Special School,
as she didn’t like the  movement of the
bus as it made her feel dizzy despite the way her wheelchair was tied down.
Casey’s balance was affected by her cerebral palsy, and she had a harness to
secure her into the wheelchair which she wore all the time, not just when
travelling.
Casey looked around: the bus was almost full by the time it got to her house,
and she spotted her best friend, Rachel. 
‘Hi, Rachel!’ she said, 
‘Hi Casey’ replied Rachel, 
Rachel Brown was the same age as Casey, and had long blonde hair and blue eyes.
She was wearing a red jacket and jeans. She  sat in
a manual wheelchair and also had cerebral palsy. Casey and Rachel had
known each other for years, and their mums were best friends. They chatted
excitedly about what they were going to do at school that day, 
Casey’s favourite thing to do at school was read, and Rachel’s was, too. They
were both top of the class in reading, and they had learnt to read quickly.
Today was the end of term Book Fair, and they were both looking forward to
having a new book to read for the holidays. 
Just then, the bus pulled up to the school gates and Bill parked it in the
reserved parking space. He pushed the button to open the doors at the back of
the bus,  and put the lift down, so that
the children and the carers could get off the bus. Everybody crossed the car
park and went through the automatic doors into the building. 
The fist person Casey and Rachel saw, unfortunately, was Angela, a thin girl
with blonde curly hair, who was with her dark–haired friend, Kelly, and was a
real bully.  Angela turned her wheelchair
towards them, and said ‘so, who’s here today then? Maybe you’ll both finally
learn something seeing as it’s the last day!’ 
Sophie said ‘Angela, you’d better get to class too, don’t you think?’ 
 ‘Go away, Angela’, Casey and Rachel
said. They hoped she wouldn’t bother them for the rest of the day. 
Greenacres Special School was a modern and spacious building, and was built
only five years ago. It was a long, red brick building all on one level, and
had ramps coming out of various doors. For Carrie and John Ford, it seemed the
best choice for their daughter when they were choosing which school she’d go
to, as since being built it had been awarded 
‘excellent’ in all of its OFSTED reports. They wanted Casey to get
the best support possible in her classes. 
The school was named after the huge area of land it was built on, and had its
own outdoor swimming pool, as well as indoor hydrotherapy pool, rooms for
physical and occupational therapy, and a sensory room. All the rooms had
electric doors, and were big enough for a whole class of children in
wheelchairs. 
The teachers had hung the children’s’ paintings, artwork and stories on the
walls, which were painted bright colours. There was the reading area in one
corner, which had shelves full of books, and looked like  a mini library, and all the desks were large
enough for any type of wheelchair to fit underneath, and could be changed  in both height and angle. Casey’s and
Rachel’s desks were side-by-side.
All the children came into the class. In total, there were fifteen students in
Casey’s class, and there were four assistants. Some of the children had their
own personal assistants, like Casey did. Their teacher, Miss Honeysuckle, was
twenty five years old, but despite that had lots of experience working with
children with disabilities.  She sat at
her desk and filled out the register for the day. Everybody was in the class
today. She welcomed them and began the class.
The day consisted of using the sensory room, music, some reading and then it
was lunchtime. Diane, a tall woman with short red hair who was Casey’s
classroom assistant, accompanied her to the canteen, which was a large room
with the same tables as the classrooms. 
She got Casey’s  square purple lunchbox
out of her rucksack, then opened the door and said ‘it’s a lovely day’.
When they saw the sunshine, Casey asked
 ‘Can we eat outside? I want to eat
outside!’ 
‘Yes, me too’ said Rachel. 
‘All right  girls, let’s go outside!’
said Diane, and opened the door wider to help Casey through.  Rachel followed. They went down the ramp and
then found a large paved area by some trees. It was not very busy, so Casey,
Diane, Rachel and Rachel’s assistant Jackie had their lunch there. 
Then, suddenly, Angela appeared again, and ran her wheelchair into
Rachel’s. 
 ‘Be careful’, warned Diane, and Jackie. 
‘I can see the stupid girls are back’, said Amanda, ‘I hope you learn something
on your last day’.
 ‘Ignore her’, said the carers. When they
had finished, they went back into the school building and back into
class. 
Miss Honeysuckle told them that the Book Fair had just arrived, and that they
would go and have a look at the books. 
Casey and Rachel had beaming smiles on their faces when they heard this,
and wanted to be the first in line to go. A few minutes later, the entire class
was making its way into the school hall, where the Book Fair was held. A lot of
the books were aimed at children with disabilities, for example, there were
Braille books and large print books as well as books that could be used with e
book readers. There were also some books for adults. Casey bought The Lion
the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis, and Rachel bought a book of fairy
stories. Whilst at the Book Fair, Casey even saw her mum, who taught people
younger than Casey and Rachel. Miss Honeysuckle was busy looking at books for
her class when she saw Casey’s mum, Carrie. 

‘Carrie’ she called, ‘over here.’ 
Carrie Ford walked over to where she was standing. Ella Honeysuckle said
quietly, so as not to be overheard by the children ‘come to my classroom later,
I have a surprise up my sleeve for the children - in fact, it’s a kind of
end-of-term party’.  
‘Very interesting’ said Carrie. ‘I’ll be there in ten minutes. 
’When the Book Fair ended, she felt excitement for the children.
 She led her own class back to their
classroom. As her class of seven-year-olds put their books and rucksacks away
with the help of their assistants, she told them that they were going to see
Miss Honeysuckle’s class and off they went. 
As they reached her classroom door, Carrie knocked on it,  and was greeted by the sight of tables with
food and drink on and the classroom was decorated with streamers in different
bright colours, blue, pink, green and yellow.  There was even a banner
with ‘HAPPY SUMMER HOLIDAYS!’ written
on it, which Miss Honeysuckle herself had made. 
The children had a great  time at
the party, and then it was time to go home.   Miss Honeysuckle stopped the
party at half past two, half an hour earlier than the school day usually ended,
and said ‘and now, children, it’s time for the summer holidays!’
The children who had Personal Assistants were helped to get ready by them,
whilst the other class assistants helped clear the tables from the party and
leave the classroom tidier than it was. 
The children were smiling and happy. They were all really excited to
have time off school for the summer. 
Miss Honeysuckle cleared the rest of the food away. Because Casey’s
mother was a teacher and worked at the school, she would be allowed to take
some of the food home, but she didn’t know it yet. 
Miss Honeysuckle took Casey’s mother and a classroom Assistant of hers
called  Trisha, a black- haired
twenty-year-old, and whispered ‘help me bring all this food and drink back to
the Staffroom’, waving her hand towards 
the leftover food and drinks. Between them, they did.
The Staffroom was at the opposite end of the building. They opened the red
door  and some of the other teachers
looked at them, wondering why they had the food and drink in their hands. They
asked what they did to celebrate the end of term. When Ella and Carrie told
them about the party, many teachers thought it was a good idea, and secretly
promised themselves they’d be more imaginative next time.  
Miss Honeysuckle and Carrie put the food on the table. ‘Help yourselves’, said
Trisha. There were smiles and low giggles as some teachers did just that, some
snacking on what was left of the bags of crisps, cakes, party sausages, sausage
rolls and caffeine-free soft drinks. 
 Georgina, a teacher who’d just arrived
from, Boston, suggested sharing the food out amongst them.  All the teachers agreed this was a good idea,
as many of the teachers had children themselves, and so the food would get
eaten and not be wasted, Maggie, an Occupational Therapist, found some carrier
bags in a nearby storage cupboard, and all the teachers started sharing the
leftovers between them. There were two male teachers at the school: Ian
Wainwright and David Smith. They were both very tall, with black hair and blue
eyes.  David was eating a sausage roll
and chatting to Ian. 
‘It’s great we have some time off work now’ he said.  
‘Yes it really is’ answered Ian. 
The door opened just at that moment, and Emily Pryor, the Headmistress walked
in. Emily had long, curly red hair and brown eyes. She was petite, thin and very
bubbly. All the teachers at Greenacres Special School agreed she was the best
headmistress they’d had so far, and the school had flourished in the four years
she’d been in command.  In a way, it was
truly ‘her’ school. 
‘Having fun?’  she asked them.  
All the teachers laughed. She remembered then that she had one last surprise
for the term: she went to her locker, opened it, and took out a  bag of hand-painted  wooden photo frames. She had a real talent
for art and crafts, and had made one for each teacher. They were individually
decorated to reflect the personality of each member of her staff. She passed
them round. Each was wrapped in tissue paper the same colour as the frame
inside it. 
Carrie opened the pale yellow tissue paper surrounding hers. The frame   had
yellow sunflowers on it and, in curly painted letters, it said ‘sunny’ 
‘Aww thanks so much’ she said. 
 Then, she found a Tupperware container
in the small kitchen area of the Staffroom, and put some sausage rolls, inside
before she closed the bright red lid. She also took some crisps, six cans of
Lemon Fanta and Sprite and a bottle of caffeine-free-Coke. 
She looked at her Dolce and Gabbana watch, which John had given her last
Christmas, and said ‘right, I’d better go and get Casey.’
The teachers said their goodbyes, and she left the Staffroom. 
When she got back to the classroom, Casey was ready and waiting in her summer
coat and Diane was by her side.
 Diane gave her a hug, and said. ‘I’ll
accompany you outside.’
 She did. The school minibus was there,
Bill was waiting. 
Suddenly, Carrie said ‘Bill, Casey’s coming with me.’  
Casey said ‘why aren’t I going on the bus, Mum?’
Carrie explained  ‘I have the van with
me’.
 She’d gone home in her lunch hour, left
her car, and driven back to the school with the family’s adapted van. 
Casey’s face broke into a grin. ‘Thanks, Mum’ she said. 
The van was a great help for getting Casey around. It was a silver Fiat van
which the family had bought years ago. Carrie opened the passenger door and put
her black handbag on the seat,  and then
opened the sliding door to put the carrier bags on one of the seats so she had
her hands free to help her daughter. She pulled the ramp down, pulling the
straps tight on each side of the ramp to create a safety barrier so it would be
safer when they went up the ramp.To see more, visit my blog http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.esPara ver más, visite mi blog  http://alittleblogofshortstoriesandpoems.blogspot.com.es",21.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My wife and I have always loved books, and since we were beginner readers we knew we would grow up surrounded by them. While my vision was a bit vague and I would always say I wanted to be a storyteller, Amanda has dreamed of being an author from the very start. She went to school, got bit by an anaconda in Peru, left school, became a wife and mother, wrote books and had them published, went on the road to sell her books, had two publishing houses fold up, created her own publishing house, went through a traumatic divorce, wrote another book, built up her publishing house into a global community of authors, artists, and editors, got remarried, and is now opening a bookstore and art gallery. So she has some stories to tell!<br/><br/>Through all this, one of our children has become confined to a wheelchair and another is on the autism spectrum, so being on the road and selling books at far away events every weekend has become impossible. Line by Lion Publishing, our publishing house, represents not only our dream but also the dreams of authors who have their own amazing stories to tell. Rather than give up or declare it to be too difficult, we chose to transition to a brick-and-mortar store where independent authors can reach the public alongside local art and music.</p>
<p>With your contributions, we can make this dream (so many people's dreams) come true in a big way. Not only in a practical sense of creating a place of home-away-from home surrounded by creativity, or seeing a book go from idea to finished product in the hand of a customer, but also in the much larger sense of being able to show our four children (and children everywhere) that dreams are worth pursuing and are achievable outside of cheesy movies!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding will go toward the basic introductory necessities: rent, renovations, transferring utilities and paying for stock to make sure this bookstore can become a reason people visit Frankfort Avenue (or maybe a reason to come to Louisville! - we have big dreams). We are asking for $5000 because we understand any adventure comes with a lot of surprises and we want to be prepared for things we can't even see coming, yet. We are turning this bookstore into a comfortable place where people can feel at home, which means repainting old walls, rearranging bookshelves (and a LOT of books), and decorating everything from the ceiling to the walls to the street space outside. We will also be providing entertainment like character actors, live music, and signing events by beloved or brand new authors year round. We are a small business in the creative field, we know that people in the creative arts can die of 'exposure' and we intend to properly support those that bring life to our store.</p>
<p>We are giving back to the community, but in a more direct sense, we want to give back to you with special perks for your donation. There will be a pack of 4x6 postcards with images from the art gallery, art from Charlotte &amp; Daisy (the novel by Amanda Lamkin, author and publisher and owner of The Roar-Shack), and commemorative photos from the grand opening. For higher-tier perks, we will be offering t-shirts or other swag items so you can brag to the world about how you helped make this lion roar. For those that truly give of their heart, and want to know they had a big part of making dreams come true, we have a special treat: a half-hour professional photo session with a photographer and graphic artist who will capture you or your family wearing your favorite costume from your favorite story (movie or book), and one image from the shoot will be edited to look like it came right from the pages or screen.</p>
<p>Though we dream big, we understand things don't always work exactly as planned. In the event that we don't reach our full goal, we are working with IndieGoGo to still make use of the funds that you do provide! Our top priority will be the basic necessities of keeping the shop open, paying bills and employees, and providing that atmosphere of welcoming and safety which is critical to our ideals. Even if you are not able to give very much, we want you to know that we are grateful for all the support of our family, friends, and fans. Please come to our events, find a new story (or an old friend), and discover the art gallery and local music we will feature.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As was said before, this bookstore means we can give our publishing house a home. We will be selling used and new books, and we will have a special section devoted to those books we have discovered and worked so hard over to bring to life. Here you can see what an independent publisher can do (fun fact: we're too big to be called a 'small press publisher' anymore!), from developmental editing to cleanup to cover art and distribution. Does that sound like a great thing for authors? It is! But it's also great for readers. There's a lot of repetition in the big name publishing houses - they know what formula works and they're going to stick with it because they have a lot of overhead that they need to pay for. We have the benefit of finding the unusual stories, the ones with the fun twists or the unexpected take. These stories deserve their spot on the shelf, and we will make sure they get it even if we have to create a bookstore around that shelf! But seriously, we love books that feel fresh and real and tell stories we can relate to in worlds that are just a little different from ours - or really weird.</p>
<p>Along with this, we're not creating a library. There's no reason for awkward, hushed voices in a bookstore where pirate music is playing, coffee is brewing, the shopcat has just knocked over the business cards again, and Gandalf just walked through the young-adult section. The Roar-Shack will be a place of comfort, meeting friends, attending fun events, and ALSO discovering music, art, and of course books. We long for the day when we hear someone casually remark ""Hey, let's go to The Roar-Shack, and then we can go get something to eat at the other shops on Frankfort.""  Or ""I'm going to The Roar-Shack before flamenco classes, wanna come?"" Trust me, Frankfort Avenue is already a fascinating destination. We just want to be a reason you go there again, or the reason you discovered it in the first place.</p>
<p>Don't listen to the nay-sayers who mutter that books are going out of style. E-books are great, and we sell those too, but nothing will replace the feel, weight, and fragrance of a real novel in your hands. Someone once said: ""Seeing someone reading a book you love is seeing a book recommending a person."" We connect with novels, and reading an old-fashioned page-turner says something about you to the people around you. (Sometimes it says you're pretentious, so be careful.) Studies show that while e-readers are popular, a rising majority of people prefer keeping or rediscovering the joy of reading from a paper book. We are not worried about going out of style. Even while big name book stores are struggling to find their place, we understand that readers are looking for that connection to the author and to each other - not some gimmick or sterile experience along the lines of picking up something from the pharmacy. The Roar-Shack is a timeless sort of place, and we know it will be a successful component in our community.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This won't be easy! We're talking about a new business, shaking up expectations, and working with a lot of other small businesses that will all be leaning on each other for support and cooperation. No adventure is easy. They wouldn't call it an adventure, then. That would just be...chores, or something.</p>
<p>We are starting out as a two-person team. We already have friends and coworkers stepping up to fill roles, but ultimately it falls on one married couple to make this work. The publishing house was very similar (I started out as a fan, then became Amanda's cover artist, and eventually creative director. Then, later, I asked her to marry me. She likes to call it reverse nepotism.) This challenge is being met daily, though! Your support in this campaign won't be going toward any new hires, but showing up and telling your friends to show up and make our bookstore successful will! We have a budget in place and a growth plan to extend hours with a team of fun and reliable employees. What good is a bookstore if it closes when you leave work?</p>
<p>The other challenge is, of course, reminding people that it is okay to enjoy reading. It has become a little fashionable to sniff and announce that you don't read. Over the years, we have acquired friends in all sorts of fields who love to read like we do. As a bonus, popular culture has been devouring our favorite sci-fi and fantasy novels and turning them into major Hollywood movies. Together with fans, we plan to have events with costumed characters, reading times, storytelling, and musical shenanigans where people can come and enjoy themselves and see just how much can be found inside the pages of these books surrounding them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't despair if you don't have the money to chip in right now. Tell everyone about this new adventure, make plans to come and see us, and tell us what you enjoy reading so we can help you find that old classic you've been missing or introduce you to a new voice you'll love!</p>
<p>Conversations around the coffee pot work great, but don't forget to use all of the social media. Share this campaign! Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, even the Indiegogo sharing tools. Get the word out so this can be the most successful grand opening ever. We're counting on you!</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My wife and I have always loved books, and since we were beginner readers we knew we would grow up surrounded by them. While my vision was a bit vague and I would always say I wanted to be a storyteller, Amanda has dreamed of being an author from the very start. She went to school, got bit by an anaconda in Peru, left school, became a wife and mother, wrote books and had them published, went on the road to sell her books, had two publishing houses fold up, created her own publishing house, went through a traumatic divorce, wrote another book, built up her publishing house into a global community of authors, artists, and editors, got remarried, and is now opening a bookstore and art gallery. So she has some stories to tell!Through all this, one of our children has become confined to a wheelchair and another is on the autism spectrum, so being on the road and selling books at far away events every weekend has become impossible. Line by Lion Publishing, our publishing house, represents not only our dream but also the dreams of authors who have their own amazing stories to tell. Rather than give up or declare it to be too difficult, we chose to transition to a brick-and-mortar store where independent authors can reach the public alongside local art and music.
With your contributions, we can make this dream (so many people's dreams) come true in a big way. Not only in a practical sense of creating a place of home-away-from home surrounded by creativity, or seeing a book go from idea to finished product in the hand of a customer, but also in the much larger sense of being able to show our four children (and children everywhere) that dreams are worth pursuing and are achievable outside of cheesy movies!

What We Need & What You Get
Funding will go toward the basic introductory necessities: rent, renovations, transferring utilities and paying for stock to make sure this bookstore can become a reason people visit Frankfort Avenue (or maybe a reason to come to Louisville! - we have big dreams). We are asking for $5000 because we understand any adventure comes with a lot of surprises and we want to be prepared for things we can't even see coming, yet.

We are a small business in the creative field, we know that people in the creative arts can die of 'exposure' and we intend to properly support those that bring life to our store.
We are giving back to the community, but in a more direct sense, we want to give back to you with special perks for your donation. There will be a pack of 4x6 postcards with images from the art gallery, art from Charlotte & Daisy (the novel by Amanda Lamkin, author and publisher and owner of The Roar-Shack), and commemorative photos from the grand opening.

We use beautiful imagery, clean design, and scripturally-sound articles to show our readers how the Gospel is woven into every aspect of being a woman, wife, and mom. Our goal through this campaign is to raise funding for the government applications that allow us to incorporate and become a non-profit, as well as the ability to print our very first issue! Our biggest goal is to distribute this magazine to as many Christian women as possible.We have six sections within our magazine, each based off of roles we carry as women:
Christ-follower (Christian living and theology -- ultimately woven into all categories)
Help-mate (Marriage)
Mother (Parenting)
Creator (Artistry and DIY)
Keeper of the Home (Homemaking)
Individual (Hobbies, Career, Service, and Ministry)
Here's what fans have said so far about our magazine:""I was truly blessed by this sample edition of the magazine! Thank you, ladies, for using your talents to minister to the Body. I'm so excited about what God is going to do through you all."""". . .when she posted something about deeply rooted, my heart skipped a beat. I have been looking around lately thinking, 'Why are there so many magazines celebrating a false reality? So many artists creating work that is based on an illusion, rather than the messy, imperfect, beautiful, God-woven, raw life we are all living?' -- and then, here you are!""""Very excited about your new mag! It's right up my alley . . . I'm sure it will be a blessing to many!""""It is amazing what you guys are doing. Yes, we all want pretty things . . .but if we don't know our purpose and our Creator, it's pointless. Society today has made it so difficult for Christians to focus and do what we are called to do and I feel as though the enemy is working double time to try to distract everyone from the real deal . . . We need more magazines, companies, businesses like this.""WHAT WE NEEDWe are not here to make money. Our goal is that by becoming a religious non-profit and having the ability to accept tax-deductible donations, we will be able to make our digital publication free to anyone and off-set the expensive cost of printing.Our goal is to raise $11,200 and as you see in our fabulous pie chart, most of the expenses go toward the product you receive from your contributions. There are costs needed beyond this figure, but we tried to boil it down to the most essential needs because this is an all or nothing campaign. If we do not reach our funding goal, we will not receive any funding and all contributions will be refunded. We trust in God's full provision and ask you to consider giving. By investing in our cause, you are changing hearts and lives.WHAT YOU GETIf you look at the right sidebar, you will see the different reward levels for each contribution. Each reward includes sales tax and shipping (with the exception of inter national shipping.)At $50, you receive this eco-friendly tote along with a print and digital copy of our first issue. It beautifully displays the hand-lettered verse, Colossians 2:6-7, our magazine verse. This tote is made of thick, 12-ounce cotton canvas that is made of natural, biodegradable material and is dyed a dark navy color. The dark color means it won't get dirty as easily, which we know is a must for moms especially! The size is 11"" x 14"" x 5"" with an extra long handle. It's perfect for carrying books, our magazines, and anything else you may want to throw in there.If you give the first $300 donation, you will receive this one-of-a-kind wood-burned art which has been generously donated by Hand-Lettering Co. This 16.25""x14"" was carefully crafted by hand. It beautifully displays our magazine's verse, Colossians 2:6-7. Along with it, you will receive our eco-friendly tote, a printed copy and a digital copy.THE NEEDPinterest is proof that women are searching. It could be a workout plan, a perfectly curated wardrobe, or a collection of self-help quotes. If you untangle all the webs, you will find one common denominator and that is the desire to improve self and quality of life. Unfortunately, many Christian women are caught in the under-current of it all. Deeply Rooted Magazine serves to battle the things in life that work overtime to steal our attention and affection away from God. We strive to deliver incredibly-rich content, written and created by published authors, real life women, and talented artists. Our Gospel-centered articles are filled with practical application, forming a magazine that will encourage, inspire, and challenge you with solid, Biblical truth.There are a lot of great, Christian resources out there, but many people never pick them up because of the way they look. People judge a book by its cover and in today's age, high quality design is important. On the other hand, there are many well-designed publications out there, but the content is lacking. We haven't found a Christian publication that provides both: the scripturally-sound content and good design. We want to change that.THE REWARDWe have already received an overwhelming response to our cause. So many women have written us and commented about how they have been encouraged by our social media posts and sample issue. We are excited that there are women out there that want to be ""deeply rooted"" women and that will translate into their marriage, parenting, relationships, and home.Not only does this magazine bless the consumer, it also blesses the people on staff and contributing. We have 40 writers, artists, staff members, and guest contributors for our first issue and each one of them have expressed how grateful they are for the ability to use their gifts of writing, painting, designing, etc. for such a great cause. These people are published authors, stay at home moms, pastors, renowned photographers, and much more. Beyond that, they all share in our vision and want to be a part of this movement.The central idea of our magazine for 2014 is: Becoming Deeply Rooted. This takes hold in the following themes for the year: seed, plant, branch and root. In order to become a deeply rooted woman, we need to start at the very beginning: seed to root. This concept is woven throughout all our articles. Here are some things you can expect to read in our first issue:
Articles like ""What is Theology and Why Should I Care?"" and ""Planting Seeds Through Evangelism""

Several recipes and DIY projects
Book reviews, testimonies, and more
Images/designs from several renowned photographers, illustrators, and painters to coincide with each piece.

Our magazine is set apart from many other Christian publications in many ways:
CLEAN DESIGN & AD-FREE - We want you to be able to focus on the content and images without getting distracted by something that is screaming for your attention. 
PERFECT BINDING - Unlike many saddle-stiched magazines which have fewer page numbers, thinner paper, and are stitched/stapled, perfect binding glues the edges of the pages to the spine giving the magazine a more polished look and feel.
HEAVIER PAPER - All 96-pages are printed on high-quality, offset-opaque paper with a dull-matte 130# cover.
We understand that not everyone can give. There are still other ways you can help.SPREAD THE WORDThe more buzz we create about Deeply Rooted, the greater chance we will reach our goal and reach the hearts of women across the world.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now that you know 'why,' I'd like to explain 'how.' </p>
<p>I've already completed the manuscript and self-publishing is the route I'm taking to get this message out into the world. That means that all of the services that would be provided by a publisher (through a book contract) is my financial responsibility.</p>
<p>I've secured award-winning book cover designer Nick Zelinger (NZ Graphics) and his cover perfectly captures the feeling of this project! He is also doing the interior book lay-out design. Laura E. Young &amp; Kim Fahner (editing), Greg Tremblay (video promotion), Dr. Judith Briles (The Book Shepherd/Author U Extravaganza) and Joel Friedlander (The Book Designer) have also been instrumental in preparing me for publishing success.</p>
<p>Your contribution will continue to pay for the services of quality professionals, so that you will enjoy a top-quality book. It still requires publishing, marketing, distribution and book tour management. I've invested more than $3,000 of my own funds so far, so I'm committed.</p>
<p>If my goal is exceeded, funds will then go towards preparing and producing the second and third in the series of Love Letters books (about relationships and spirituality), a website design (and someone to maintain it), designing workshops, speaking engagements and enhanced advertising of my life coaching service (Lovin'-U-Large Life Coaching).</p>
<p>If my goal is not met, all funds will still be used to publish my book. It will just take longer. But why wait?</p>
<p>Not only will you be able to feel that you have been part of a Lovin'-the-World-Large movement with your contribution, you will also enjoy some unique and spiffy perks!</p>
<p>Please see the 'Perks' section for a more detailed account of what you will receive, since there are rewards for 7 levels of giving and a whole lotta Love'n'Gratitude I wish to share!</p><p><i>LOVIN'-U-LARGE LIFE COACHING TESTIMONIAL:</i></p><p><i>When I started with Paulette Dahl, I did not know anything about Life Coaching. I called her because she is a friend of mine and I needed help with a career transition. I had a few opportunities to make changes and did not know where to start.</i></p><p><i>Paulette really helped me think through things and then take measures to get results. She was firm as needed but also very sensitive and helpful. I am much more relaxed these days and doing better. It was a difficult process for me, but Paulette made it better with her patience and support. I did not realize that the patterns of behaviour that affected my professional life were the exact same patterns that affected my personal life. When Paulette helped me explore the connection, I was able to improve all aspects of my life.</i></p><p><i>I am embarking on a new part of my life now and I feel like a door has been opened to a greater awareness. I cannot thank Paulette enough for the wonderful insight, so beautifully worded and the support and encouragement and belief in me!</i></p><p><i>R.M., Sudbury, ON</i></p>
<p><i><b>An added BONUS!! When I reach my goal, there will be an additional gift for the first 100 contributors who donate $100 or more! You will receive a creative and original Extraordinary Loving for Everyday Living 2015 Thot-Full Calendar, filled with amazing photographs (some of which are in the video) and Thots!! Copyright 2014/2015 Paulette Dahl (writer) and Jeanine Middleton (photographer). This will be sent out in November.</b></i></p>
<p>Follow me on Twitter: Paulette Dahl @Thotsfortheday.</p>
<p>With all of the challenges of delays and setbacks, I am even more prepared to celebrate that extraordinary loving IS for everyday living.</p>

Now that you know 'why,' I'd like to explain 'how.' 
I've already completed the manuscript and self-publishing is the route I'm taking to get this message out into the world. That means that all of the services that would be provided by a publisher (through a book contract) is my financial responsibility.
I've secured award-winning book cover designer Nick Zelinger (NZ Graphics) and his cover perfectly captures the feeling of this project! He is also doing the interior book lay-out design. Laura E. Young & Kim Fahner (editing), Greg Tremblay (video promotion), Dr. Judith Briles (The Book Shepherd/Author U Extravaganza) and Joel Friedlander (The Book Designer) have also been instrumental in preparing me for publishing success.
Your contribution will continue to pay for the services of quality professionals, so that you will enjoy a top-quality book. It still requires publishing, marketing, distribution and book tour management. I've invested more than $3,000 of my own funds so far, so I'm committed.
If my goal is exceeded, funds will then go towards preparing and producing the second and third in the series of Love Letters books (about relationships and spirituality), a website design (and someone to maintain it), designing workshops, speaking engagements and enhanced advertising of my life coaching service (Lovin'-U-Large Life Coaching).
If my goal is not met, all funds will still be used to publish my book. It will just take longer. But why wait?
Not only will you be able to feel that you have been part of a Lovin'-the-World-Large movement with your contribution, you will also enjoy some unique and spiffy perks!
Please see the 'Perks' section for a more detailed account of what you will receive, since there are rewards for 7 levels of giving and a whole lotta Love'n'Gratitude I wish to share!LOVIN'-U-LARGE LIFE COACHING TESTIMONIAL:When I started with Paulette Dahl, I did not know anything about Life Coaching. I called her because she is a friend of mine and I needed help with a career transition. I had a few opportunities to make changes and did not know where to start.Paulette really helped me think through things and then take measures to get results. She was firm as needed but also very sensitive and helpful. I am much more relaxed these days and doing better. It was a difficult process for me, but Paulette made it better with her patience and support. I did not realize that the patterns of behaviour that affected my professional life were the exact same patterns that affected my personal life. When Paulette helped me explore the connection, I was able to improve all aspects of my life.I am embarking on a new part of my life now and I feel like a door has been opened to a greater awareness. I cannot thank Paulette enough for the wonderful insight, so beautifully worded and the support and encouragement and belief in me!R.M., Sudbury, ON
An added BONUS!! When I reach my goal, there will be an additional gift for the first 100 contributors who donate $100 or more! You will receive a creative and original Extraordinary Loving for Everyday Living 2015 Thot-Full Calendar, filled with amazing photographs (some of which are in the video) and Thots!! Copyright 2014/2015 Paulette Dahl (writer) and Jeanine Middleton (photographer). This will be sent out in November.
Follow me on Twitter: Paulette Dahl @Thotsfortheday.
With all of the challenges of delays and setbacks, I am even more prepared to celebrate that extraordinary loving IS for everyday living.
Everyone needs Love. Fuel the Love. Change the world.

<p><span>*UPDATE*</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><span>The lovely folk at Indiego have given this campaign another life line. Yay!</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">A Summary</span></h3>
<p>Dexter is a slightly different member of our global family. He's an enigma, the type of guy you would want to have with you on a fishing expedition - merely because he would make the hours of waiting, hook and sinker, bearable by the virtue of his quirkiness. He views the world through somewhat tinted glasses but does not shy away from putting his mark, whether in form of opinion or advice, on every little detail he comes across. He is curious like a cat and just as alluring. Give him some time, he will amaze (and intrigue) you.</p>
<p>I have been writing about him since 2005 and collected all of the stories that ensued on my blog <a href=""http://youniverses-us.blogspot.co.nz/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youniverses-us.blogspot.co.nz/</a> - until one day a very dear friend of mine prompted me to compile them all and make a book out of them. I did all of the art work associated with the book (cover image and internal exposes) myself. As a means to put this out 'legitimately,' I started my own publishing company (CVR Press Ltd) and released the first eBook on Amazon under a pseudonym, Dan Tefern (comprised of my favourite boy's name 'Dante' and my favourite plant, the 'fern',) in late November of last year: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6L8L6S"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6L8L6S</a>.</p>
<p>In the first months, the book managed to land several times in the top 100 'best political humour' books on Amazon - but as anyone who has published on Amazon would know, I have yet to see any remuneration from sales on that site (I also put the top 100 accolade down to the fact that there just aren't that many people writing political satire at present, for better or worse.) </p>
<p>On a shoestring budget, we managed to do a limited print run late last year. Unfortunately I didn't take the exorbitant international NZ shipping fees into account, essentially selling out of my print run, at a loss. But you live and learn and all I really want is for people to read the books anyway.</p>
<p>Over the past months, Dexter's been likened to some great personalities of recent popular fiction: part 'Dustin Hoffman in Rainman', infused with the 'subtle wit of Forrest Gump' and he 'most certainly is a 21st century version of Ignatius J Reilly' from the incredible book, A Confederacy of Dunces' (my personal favourite as I loved that book growing up.)</p>
<p>Harry Mulisch (author of the widely acclaimed 'Discovery of Heaven') who mentored me in the beginning, told me he was 'in love with the character' before he sadly passed away in 2010.</p>
<p>By no means does my Dexter bear any resemblance to the character of the popular US television show of the same name - hand to heart, the name came to me before I even knew such a show existed. For that I would have to watch television in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We'll Create for you</h3>
<p>These funds would help us run a second print run of the first volume (""Becoming Dexter"") as well as finance targeted online campaigns to stir greater publicity and pay for the proof reading/editing of the next 3 volumes.</p>
<p>Eventually a dream would also be to organise a book launch and the compiling of the final Anthology  - all four volumes - as one illustrated hardback coffee table edition.</p>
<p>In a nutshell the four volumes are split as follows:</p>
<p><em><strong>Vol. 1:</strong> ""Becoming Dexter""</em> (already published): This is the prologue of the story if you will. It explores Dexter's early life, his airline fiasco that results in him getting free air miles for the rest of his life and his first, tentative exposure to American culture. It is largely set in New Zealand and North America.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vol. 2:</strong> ""Being Dexter""</em> (finished and in post-production): His adventures take him to Europe, where he encounters a barrage of unique characters and cultures, framing them in his own unique 'kiwi' way. Shedding some light on the dichotomy of people that exist on this continent. This is his true 'coming of age' book- hence the title.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vol. 3:</strong> ""Leaving Dexter""</em> (planned): The journey continues to Asia, where Dexter faces a complete overhaul of his culinary and cultural values. He fights his first bouts with homesickness and falls in love for a third time. Without revealing too much plot line, the stage becomes set for his final and possibly most important encounter.</p>
<p><em><strong>Vol. 4:</strong> ""Dexter Returns""</em> (in planning): After a significant event in Vol. 3, Dexter's character gets a new 'lease on life' and travels to some of the most forlorn areas on this planet, South America, Africa whilst finally traversing to the Middle East, where he attempts to have a tangible input on the Israel/Palestine conflict and impending peace conference. Oh no!? say you.. Oh yes! say we. Trust us, it will resonate on many levels.</p>
<p>We are also set to record an audio book of all the volumes as well as an extended videologue; where we get the author and a few of the people involved to discuss the story and read the chapters (see it as an extended dvd extras piece - sort of like a director's commentary but a lot funnier and more enlightening- we think).</p>
<p>Oh and the art work is a whole story in itself and shall be revealed to each contributor, secretly. But you really want a print. They are spectacular. And different. Just like the story.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Seeing that our main character does float about on the nigh' all-encompassing, yet slightly controversial spectrum of autism, we have approached the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand for support; whereby we will donate a percentage of any proceeds to their fantastic ""Rethinking Mental Illness"" campaign. I used to work with children with autism and have first hand experience of the immense work that goes into taking care of these amazing human beings. They need all the support they can get. </p>
<p>The least we can do if this series turns out to be fiscally successful is to give back. That's what we are all about - as we never intended to make a lot of money with the story- it was catharsis first and foremost and it is more important to us that people read it and tell others about it, as we believe it does have the ability to break down barriers and get people talking. About the things that really matter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Naturally, most of you who see this campaign won't be able to contribute. That's a given! So what we thought we could do for you guys, is get you to send your email address to <a href=""mailto:editor@cvrpress.co.nz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">editor@cvrpress.co.nz</a> so that we can at least send you a free eBook - as a token of our appreciation for you taking the time to read through our campaign and taking an interest in the story. If you like the story, we don't want you to link it to your network, but rather bring it up in conversation at the next dinner party you attend.</p>
<p>Old school-styles. </p>
<p>Much love to you all and Kia ora from Aotearoa (Land of the Long White Cloud) New Zealand. </p>
<h3>About The Author</h3>
<p>This is a book I have dreamed my whole life about writing. Having a character that is slightly socially awkward yet genius in his own way wander the world and document it as he sees it - both quixotically and empathetically - feels liberating. The stories fly into my head and it is easy for me to write them down as the character comes naturally to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps a bit of background; previously, in another life, I studied to be a biologist in the UK, trained as an immunologist in the US and after spending some years as a research scientist at hospitals and biotech companies, ended up as a medical writer. At one point in my career I found myself spending a lot of time on cancer wards here in New Zealand discussing inoperable tumours and advanced-stage cancer patients. Long story short, writing this book (especially the main character, Dexter) saved me from the debilitating bouts of depression that accompany anyone who has spent time around people with late-stage cancer and whose innate sensitivity makes it difficult to process these realities in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Humour, in this case, was a means to escape the overbearing reality I was confronted with at the time. It quite literally forced me to start scribbling notes about Dexter in various situations and places, whilst waiting to talk to oncologists about patients who had little to no hope of survival beyond a few months. My own life line to say the least. A way to capture the stoic, inescapable reality of life, with a bit of humour.</p>
<p>For all you lucky contributors getting poems and spoken word art perks, here a not-at-all-pretentious little video showcasing my lyrical vernacular. Enjoy!</p>

In the first months, the book managed to land several times in the top 100 'best political humour' books on Amazon - but as anyone who has published on Amazon would know, I have yet to see any remuneration from sales on that site (I also put the top 100 accolade down to the fact that there just aren't that many people writing political satire at present, for better or worse.) 
On a shoestring budget, we managed to do a limited print run late last year. Unfortunately I didn't take the exorbitant international NZ shipping fees into account, essentially selling out of my print run, at a loss. But you live and learn and all I really want is for people to read the books anyway.
Over the past months, Dexter's been likened to some great personalities of recent popular fiction: part 'Dustin Hoffman in Rainman', infused with the 'subtle wit of Forrest Gump' and he 'most certainly is a 21st century version of Ignatius J Reilly' from the incredible book, A Confederacy of Dunces' (my personal favourite as I loved that book growing up.)
Harry Mulisch (author of the widely acclaimed 'Discovery of Heaven') who mentored me in the beginning, told me he was 'in love with the character' before he sadly passed away in 2010.
By no means does my Dexter bear any resemblance to the character of the popular US television show of the same name - hand to heart, the name came to me before I even knew such a show existed. For that I would have to watch television in the first place.


What We Need & What We'll Create for you
These funds would help us run a second print run of the first volume (""Becoming Dexter"") as well as finance targeted online campaigns to stir greater publicity and pay for the proof reading/editing of the next 3 volumes.
Eventually a dream would also be to organise a book launch and the compiling of the final Anthology  - all four volumes - as one illustrated hardback coffee table edition.
In a nutshell the four volumes are split as follows:
Vol. 1: ""Becoming Dexter"" (already published): This is the prologue of the story if you will. It explores Dexter's early life, his airline fiasco that results in him getting free air miles for the rest of his life and his first, tentative exposure to American culture. It is largely set in New Zealand and North America.
Vol. 2: ""Being Dexter"" (finished and in post-production): His adventures take him to Europe, where he encounters a barrage of unique characters and cultures, framing them in his own unique 'kiwi' way. Shedding some light on the dichotomy of people that exist on this continent. This is his true 'coming of age' book- hence the title.
Vol. 3: ""Leaving Dexter"" (planned): The journey continues to Asia, where Dexter faces a complete overhaul of his culinary and cultural values. He fights his first bouts with homesickness and falls in love for a third time. Without revealing too much plot line, the stage becomes set for his final and possibly most important encounter.
Vol. 4: ""Dexter Returns"" (in planning): After a significant event in Vol. 3, Dexter's character gets a new 'lease on life' and travels to some of the most forlorn areas on this planet, South America, Africa whilst finally traversing to the Middle East, where he attempts to have a tangible input on the Israel/Palestine conflict and impending peace conference. Oh no!? say you.. Oh yes! say we. Trust us, it will resonate on many levels.
We are also set to record an audio book of all the volumes as well as an extended videologue; where we get the author and a few of the people involved to discuss the story and read the chapters (see it as an extended dvd extras piece - sort of like a director's commentary but a lot funnier and more enlightening- we think).
Oh and the art work is a whole story in itself and shall be revealed to each contributor, secretly. But you really want a print. They are spectacular. And different. Just like the story.


The Impact
Seeing that our main character does float about on the nigh' all-encompassing, yet slightly controversial spectrum of autism, we have approached the Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand for support; whereby we will donate a percentage of any proceeds to their fantastic ""Rethinking Mental Illness"" campaign. I used to work with children with autism and have first hand experience of the immense work that goes into taking care of these amazing human beings. They need all the support they can get. 
The least we can do if this series turns out to be fiscally successful is to give back. That's what we are all about - as we never intended to make a lot of money with the story- it was catharsis first and foremost and it is more important to us that people read it and tell others about it, as we believe it does have the ability to break down barriers and get people talking. About the things that really matter.


Other Ways You Can Help
Naturally, most of you who see this campaign won't be able to contribute. That's a given! So what we thought we could do for you guys, is get you to send your email address to editor@cvrpress.co.nz so that we can at least send you a free eBook - as a token of our appreciation for you taking the time to read through our campaign and taking an interest in the story. If you like the story, we don't want you to link it to your network, but rather bring it up in conversation at the next dinner party you attend.
Old school-styles. 
Much love to you all and Kia ora from Aotearoa (Land of the Long White Cloud) New Zealand. 
About The Author
This is a book I have dreamed my whole life about writing. Having a character that is slightly socially awkward yet genius in his own way wander the world and document it as he sees it - both quixotically and empathetically - feels liberating. The stories fly into my head and it is easy for me to write them down as the character comes naturally to me.
Perhaps a bit of background; previously, in another life, I studied to be a biologist in the UK, trained as an immunologist in the US and after spending some years as a research scientist at hospitals and biotech companies, ended up as a medical writer. At one point in my career I found myself spending a lot of time on cancer wards here in New Zealand discussing inoperable tumours and advanced-stage cancer patients. Long story short, writing this book (especially the main character, Dexter) saved me from the debilitating bouts of depression that accompany anyone who has spent time around people with late-stage cancer and whose innate sensitivity makes it difficult to process these realities in any meaningful way.
Humour, in this case, was a means to escape the overbearing reality I was confronted with at the time. It quite literally forced me to start scribbling notes about Dexter in various situations and places, whilst waiting to talk to oncologists about patients who had little to no hope of survival beyond a few months. My own life line to say the least. A way to capture the stoic, inescapable reality of life, with a bit of humour.
For all you lucky contributors getting poems and spoken word art perks, here a not-at-all-pretentious little video showcasing my lyrical vernacular. Enjoy!

This is not a call for donations - everyone who contributes over $20 will get a copy of the E-book in PDF form as soon as it's published. For $50, I'll send a paper back copy to you, wherever you are in the world. For $80, it will be a signed paper back copy. And anyone who pledges over $100 will get a signed hard cover copy and have their name included in the honors list on the book/author website. Pledges over $250 will not only get the signed hard cover copy and have their name included in the honors list on the website, but they will also receive 4 free passes to attend as VIPs at any workshops put on by the author.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Based in Ypsilanti, Toronto, Brooklyn, Champaign-Urbana and Dallas-Fort Worth, <a href=""https://culturalgutter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Cultural Gutter</strong></a> was founded in 2003 by writer, filmmaker and game designer Jim Munroe and comics critic and artist Guy Leshinski to provide clear-eyed, thoughtful writing on disreputable art. Since then, we've had twelve editors in two countries and eight cities write on comics, genre films, Indian b-movies, tv, science fiction, fantasy, horror, romance and video games. In all that time we paid our writers, both our editors and guest stars. Then we lost our funding grant, but a small, rag-tag band of donors joined forces with the Gutter to keep us online and help us keep our commitment to paying writers for their work. Thus, the Gutterthon was born. And thanks to our readers like you, the Cultural Gutter has been sustained without ads, subscriptions or a paywall.</p>
<p>At the Gutter we like to think we offer something special and we're kind of proud of it. The Gutter features thoughtful, well-written articles on topics like: American Sci Fi Folk horror; Bollywood villain lairs; <i>Doom Patrol</i> and what it means to save the world; letting something you love reboot; romance and the belief that people can change; Janelle Monáe as the American cool; Ancient Egypt in Indian film; <i>Candyman</i> and ""thesis goggles""; ""Tilda Swinton: Secret Scottish Samurai""; Duran Duran &amp; William S. Burroughs' Wild Boys; and so much <i>Adventure Time</i>. So please click ""Back It"" and keep the Gutter flowing with the writing you love. Even if you can only throw in a buck, we will thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are asking for $1700 and it breaks down to $250/year/writer or about $20/article; $250/year for the Evil Overlord for publishing, promoting, and updating the site, finding new writers, day-to-day site management, making sure the perks are shipped out, and continuing work on <i>The Cultural Gutter Must Be Destroyed</i>, a collection of essays from the Gutter's current line-up. Approximately $200 will go towards website hosting and domain registration. The remaining funds will go toward perks, shipping, promotional materials, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, and paying guest writers.</p>
<p>In return, you get our undying and eternal thanks and your choice of some sweet perks. And, hopefully, writing that entertains and interests you.</p>

From the logic behind his aversion to killing to the moral status of vigilantism and his use of torture in pursuit of justice (or perhaps revenge), Batman’s ethical precepts are compelling but often inconsistent and controversial. Philosopher and pop culture expert Mark D. White uses the tools of moral philosophy to track Batman’s most striking ethical dilemmas and decisions across his most prominent storylines from the early 1970s through the launch of the New 52, and suggests how understanding the mercurial moral character of the caped crusader might help us reconcile our own.""</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>

<p>We ran a successful last fundraiser year, and, thanks to everyone's help, we kept the Gutter going and have been working on making the new Gutter as good as can be. The Cultural Gutter's survival depends on Gutterthon and on you. We know it's a bad time for creators of all kinds, that platforms are valued more than content, but we believe with your help we can keep the Gutter flowing with thoughtful writing on disreputable art. </p>
<p>We know that it's a hard and stressful time for everyone. But even a retweet or sharing our campaign on Facebook helps us out. Indiegogo has tools that make it easy. Please consider using them even if you can't contribute. Anything you do to help is appreciated.</p>

NEW PERK: Musician, scholar, raconteur and friend of the Gutter Kate Laity will create a custom theremin song just for you! Provide her with a few adjectives as prompts and soon you theremin ringtone/alarm/just something nice to listen to dreams will come true!
NEW PERK: Squalo-Ade Essentials! Our friends at MPZ Cosmetics salute renowned detective Hercule Squalo with a set of 3 cherry lemonade-scented essentials:  a  2 oz hand sanitizer, 1 oz spray lotion and a 4g lip balm. The lip balm does contain beeswax. The hand sanitizer smells nice and has a nice consistency. This perk is available in the continental US only because of US postal restrictions on shipping products like hand sanitizer.
SOLD OUT: Purple fingerless mittens with cranberry trim made and donated by Huge Shark. Keep your hands warm while getting up to any one of the hundreds of shenanigans that require your fingers. One pair is available, size large. Modeled on medium adult hands. They are 100% merino wool, pre-washed. Machine wash and lay flat to dry. Made in a house with cats.
SOLD OUT: Huge Shark has also made and donated a ""3D” textured purple and grey hat and fingerless mittens set. 100% wool. The hat is stretchy and will fit small to large size. The mitts fit small-medium hands. Items are washed before sending, but created in a house with cats. Hand wash, lay flat to dry. They look kind of like a cool dungeon wall to us.
SOLD OUT: A 5-pack of ""Monsterland, Ogasawara Island"" postcards designed by friend of the Gutter Brian Kirby of Shelf Life Clothing Company! Let loved ones know you wish they were there as you tour ""The Bonin Islands, also known as the Ogasawara Islands...an archipelago of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands some 520 mi directly south of Tokyo, Japan. Since 1999, all of the Earth's monsters have been collected and confined there in an area known as Monsterland.""
SOLD OUT: Friend of the Gutter Mark D. White has donated a signed copy of his book, Batman & Ethics! Explore the ethical code of the world's greatest detective, Batman! And maybe learn something about philosophy. ""Batman and Ethics goes behind the mask to shed new light on the complexities and contradictions of the Dark Knight’s moral code. From the logic behind his aversion to killing to the moral status of vigilantism and his use of torture in pursuit of justice (or perhaps revenge), Batman’s ethical precepts are compelling but often inconsistent and controversial. Philosopher and pop culture expert Mark D. White uses the tools of moral philosophy to track Batman’s most striking ethical dilemmas and decisions across his most prominent storylines from the early 1970s through the launch of the New 52, and suggests how understanding the mercurial moral character of the caped crusader might help us reconcile our own.""
SOLD OUT: Hey, is that Bruce?! Is that Signor Squalo from L'Ultimo Squalo himself? Regardless, you can be the forever home for this 6 in / 15.24 cm needle-felted great white shark made by friend of the Gutter, Kerry Fristoe!

SOLD OUT: A digital copy of Dracula In Istanbul, aka, ""Turkish Dracula,"" edited by Neon Harbor's Ed Glaser. ""For the first time in English comes a remarkable literary discovery. In 1928, Turkish author Ali Rıza Seyfioğlu pirated Bram Stoker’s Dracula, rewriting it with new material, patriotic overtones, and Islam. A rare example of a 'bootleg' novel, it’s also the first adaptation to plainly identify Dracula as the historical warlord Vlad the Impaler.""
SOLD OUT: Have a noggin filled with spooky thoughts? Proud of your endoskeletal cranium? Show off either or both this with a black wool beanie / watch cap with a skull pattern in light green or a grey wool beanie with a yellow skull pattern made and donated by Huge Shark! They are alpaca with merino wool skulls. Made in a house co-habited by cats, but washed before shipping. They'll fit a small to medium adult head.
We will be unlocking more perks as the campaign continues, but even $1 gets our Undying Thanks! (Really, a buck does make a difference).
If we don't reach our goal, we'll use the funds to print and ship your perks and see how much we can pay each editor. If we exceed our goal, we would use the extra funds to print promotional materials or hire more guest writers. If we significantly exceed our goal, we will use our funds to give the writers some extra money.
 

The Impact
We like to think that the Gutter offers something special: Clear-eyed, thoughtful and thought-provoking writing on disreputable art. If you donate or support our campaign by sharing it, you will help keep the Gutter online and running; support our particular take on disreputable art; and help support paying writers for their work.
We ran a successful last fundraiser year, and, thanks to everyone's help, we kept the Gutter going and have been working on making the new Gutter as good as can be. The Cultural Gutter's survival depends on Gutterthon and on you. We know it's a bad time for creators of all kinds, that platforms are valued more than content, but we believe with your help we can keep the Gutter flowing with thoughtful writing on disreputable art. 
We know that it's a hard and stressful time for everyone. But even a retweet or sharing our campaign on Facebook helps us out. Indiegogo has tools that make it easy. Please consider using them even if you can't contribute. Anything you do to help is appreciated.
Thank you from all of us at The Cultural Gutter!",0.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
1963. President Kennedy’s double is assassinated. Alive and well, JFK tries to figure out why they wanted him eliminated and what to do to protect himself against the possibility of a second assassination attempt.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The book is an historical novel filled with facts that are intermingled with unparalleled fiction. As in such films as Titanic and Forrest Gump, all of the events presented are not only real but verifiable. You can Google any event in this book and see that it did indeed happen, only in this case, fiction has rewritten the story to the point where it becomes impossible to separate fact from fantasy.</div>
<div>
<h3>Back Cover</h3>
On November 22, 1963, the entire world would learn that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. At the same moment, the closest and most influential members of the White House Staff rush to the Situation Room where they find Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and ... President John F. Kennedy who is shocked to learn that his security stand-in has just been assassinated before the live television audience, to the grief of the entire world.<br/><br/>For security reasons, it is impossible to admit that it was Kennedy’s double who was killed and that the President was not even in Dallas. Since his arrival in Texas, his lookalike had given speeches, met with officials and given interviews, all of which was far above the role of a security stand-in during a presidential tour.<br/><br/>Moreover, as the President was still in Washington, it was inevitable that people would wonder if this was the first time he had acted in this way and, if not, under what circumstances this situation had previously occurred. How long had the President been duping the public? In the minutes that follow the assassination, John Kennedy understood that his presidency was over and that the only option open to him was how to become part of history, either in disgrace or in honor.<br/><br/>All of the assassination theories to date lead to Chicago and point to members of the mafia. And yet it seems that most of the plotting in this affair happened much further south. Kennedy, who was still alive, would thereafter have a single goal: to find out not only who assassinated him but, more importantly, to understand why they wanted to eliminate him. He would now have to do everything in his power to protect himself against a possible second assassination attempt.</div>
<div>
<h3>Literary niche</h3>
Kennedy’s assassination still fascinates us more than 50 years after the event. It has fostered the publication of innumerable books trying to explain what really happened on that fateful Friday in November, 1963 with a wide variety of theories that range from the plausible to the outlandish.<br/><br/>The Kennedys created a book market in spite of themselves. Every time a new work is published, it quickly racks up enviable sales figures in bookstores and on line. In this light, Stephen King’s last novel, 11/22/63, proves that the interest in everything that surrounds John F. Kennedy is as strong as ever. King’s novel traces the history of a voyager in time who travels back to the day of the infamous event desperately trying to destroy Lee Harvey Oswald before he shoots the President. Hardly had this book been published than it shot up on the New York Times’ Best Seller list, and the film rights were subsequently acquired for a production scheduled to begin this fall.</div>

<h3>Crowdfunding <i>Crowdfunding for Authors</i>
</h3>
<p>It's a bit meta, I know - crowdfunding for a crowdfunding book. Although I've helped many authors, shepherding over $70,000 towards publication along the way, I hadn't experienced it on a project of my own. Guess what? I had more to learn. There have been delays. I have been afraid. I've hit dead ends, and brick walls. Before crowdfunding <i><b>Crowdfunding for Authors</b></i>, I knew what it <i>looked </i>like fund a book this way successfully. But I realize (sorry, my dear authors who worked with me before now) that I didn't know what it <i>felt </i>like. Not until today, when it's my book on the line.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458232387/ht4zgppocv0karxfszjt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm raising money here for professional cover design - like it or not, authors, people do judge a book by its cover. I've spent $500 on the draft for the eBook cover, which you can see here. To wrap this cover around the paperback takes about another $1,000.  But more importantly, I'm putting myself directly in your shoes. This will make <i><b>Crowdfunding for Authors</b></i> a better book for you.</p>
<p>And a little more about me: I'm Bethany Joy Carlson, CFA. I spent a couple decades in international finance, which is experience I love to share with authors. My background is in applied math and I've done research with NASA. Now I am thrilled to call Charlottesville home, where I split my time between crowdfunding consulting with <a href=""http://theartistspartner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Artist's Partner</a>, teaching math and physics at the <a href=""http://www.renaissanceschool.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Renaissance School</a>, and training my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DaxTheBlueJack/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jack Russell / Blue Heeler</a>.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<b>Pretty or plain, <i>Crowdfunding for Authors</i> will be in your hands. </b>The book is written - so even if it is just a .pdf, you will receive a copy. This campaign is providing for professional packaging, but the professional content is complete. One way or another, I can't wait to send you <i>Crowdfunding for Authors</i>!<br/> </div><div>

Crowdfunding Crowdfunding for Authors

It's a bit meta, I know - crowdfunding for a crowdfunding book. Although I've helped many authors, shepherding over $70,000 towards publication along the way, I hadn't experienced it on a project of my own. Guess what? I had more to learn. There have been delays. I have been afraid. I've hit dead ends, and brick walls. Before crowdfunding Crowdfunding for Authors, I knew what it looked like fund a book this way successfully. But I realize (sorry, my dear authors who worked with me before now) that I didn't know what it felt like. Not until today, when it's my book on the line.

I'm raising money here for professional cover design - like it or not, authors, people do judge a book by its cover. I've spent $500 on the draft for the eBook cover, which you can see here. To wrap this cover around the paperback takes about another $1,000.  But more importantly, I'm putting myself directly in your shoes. This will make Crowdfunding for Authors a better book for you.
And a little more about me: I'm Bethany Joy Carlson, CFA. I spent a couple decades in international finance, which is experience I love to share with authors. My background is in applied math and I've done research with NASA. Now I am thrilled to call Charlottesville home, where I split my time between crowdfunding consulting with The Artist's Partner, teaching math and physics at the Renaissance School, and training my Jack Russell / Blue Heeler.
Risks & Challenges
Pretty or plain, Crowdfunding for Authors will be in your hands. The book is written - so even if it is just a .pdf, you will receive a copy. This campaign is providing for professional packaging, but the professional content is complete. One way or another, I can't wait to send you Crowdfunding for Authors!

</h3> <p>was written by Laura Campbell, who is a stay at home mom, writer, coffee-aficionado, and crazy dreamer.  This story began as notes on paper and random documents years in the making, but leaped on the page within 6 months.  <br/></p>
<p>The story delves into a world of incredible circumstances that require a bravery I only hope I could produce.  Here's the official synopsis: <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Every year,
26 girls are chosen to be Protectors, a group of teenage girls who infiltrate
the oppressive Republic and
rescue those who the Republic labels ""Unnecessaries"": any imperfect,
unplanned member of their
society, or the pregnant women carrying them. 
</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Although the
High Counselor can choose a 27th, it has only happened eight times in two
centuries.  They remain legend because of
their accomplishments and special abilities. 
Never in her lifetime did Aislyn think she would see a 27<sup>th</sup>
Protector chosen…or that it would be her. 
</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Even as she
begins to doubt herself under the rigor of her training in espionage, medicine,
and physical drills, Aislyn begins to challenge obsessive peers, question a
rigid social system, and uncover her trainer Collin’s confusing emotional
whiplash.  </b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>And while
she still is uncertain, she begins to fight for the chance that she was meant
for this, and the chance to rescue a child who only has one hope for survival:
Her.</b></p>
<p>Awesome, right?</p>
<p>The truth is that this book raises great questions about how we live our lives.  Our website is going to be focused on taking the emotions you read as she rescues these children and infants and focus them on making a difference in our world through partnering organizations such as CURE and Compassion International.  </p>
<p>So, big dreams, big book, big impact...but no clout.  Since I'm a new author, self- publishing is the best way to go.  Self-Publishing campaigns can be very successful, and I've already made some connections with a Messiah College Senior who is going to edit my book at a discounted price than normal for the credit of editor in the novel, and we've already made a great cover.  We just need some extra money to get this off the ground!  Luckily, Dan (my awesome husband) has perfected the html to make this an eBook, so we are all set for Kindle!  What we need is the resources to get the first few in print, and then the profit from that will cycle back to Create Space to print more books, until eventually we'll have enough to go to Creation Festival East, where we really hope to break through to our target audience, and we can also begin to advertise on blogs as well!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<ul><li>My name is Orlando Montoya.  I started my radio career in Central Florida in 1995.  I have been producing radio stories on the Georgia coast since 1998.  My professional awards include 13 from the Georgia Associated Press Broadcast Association and two from the Society of Professional Journalists.  I have interviewed literally thousands of people across a wide range of interests and locations in Southeast Georgia.  I continue doing so through at <a href=""http://www.savannahpodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SavannahPodcast.com</a>.</li></ul>
<h3>What Is Savannah Podcast?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Savannah Podcast is a multimedia storytelling enterprise that highlights <strong>creativity, passion and change in the Coastal Empire</strong>.  It is published online at SavannahPodcast.com and iTunes.  It is broadcast as a one-hour weekly radio show at 2pm on Fridays on WHCJ 90.3 FM Savannah State University.  It is published as a print story in Connect Savannah.</li>
<li>It's <strong>broadly focused</strong> because that's the way my mind works.  I cannot limit myself to business and politics, like most of the media does, because I would get bored very easily and I think that our world is a lot richer and fuller than that.  Everyone is creative and passionate.  Everyone changes.  I believe that everyone has a story.  </li>
<li>It's <strong>broadcast quality</strong> because I'm not going to lower my standards.  I believe in a polished product, well researched, recorded on good equipment and produced over a period of days, not hours.  And all of this takes time.</li>
<li>It's <strong>in depth</strong> because I have grown tired of soundbytes and headlines.  I'd rather learn more about fewer things than skim the top of many things.</li>
<li>That's why I believe in being <strong>in conversation</strong>.  The interview format takes longer but is more personal and conveys more context.  It is an old broadcast format that sadly has fallen into disfavor.  I admired people like Dick Cavett on TV and Leonard Lopate on the radio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Is This Campaign Important?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I cannot continue to tell stories like this without your financial contributions.  I do not work for a large media corporation.  I work for myself.  That means that no one tells me what types of stories to produce or how to produce them.  But it also means that I must rely on people like you to help me make a living.</li>
<li>Your contributions help important stories get out there into the world.  Many are touched by my stories online, on the radio and in print.  I believe that telling stories is a way that we connect ourselves to other people.  By listening deeply to one another, we make the world a better place.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does This Fundraiser Work?</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you pledge to this campaign, you are paying for the time that it takes me to research, record, write, edit, produce, distribute and publicize my stories.  There are many steps that require time that isn't paid for unless you step forward and say that it is worth something.</li>
<li>You earn various rewards at various levels of support.  I have chosen ""Thank You"" gifts that focus on connecting you with great experiences in Savannah and beyond -- art, music, food and history.  The real gift is sharing stories -- like none other -- in ways like none other.</li>

Through therapy, the group find themselves involved with Kate, the daughter of a murdered police officer who investigates the suspicious circumstances surrounding her fathers death. Target audience:Spirit QC is a literary fiction novel and targets late adolescence and adult readers. The story reflects on those who have suffered due to mental health issues, as well as a relevance to Australia’s history regarding corruption within Government agencies and organised crime syndicates.
