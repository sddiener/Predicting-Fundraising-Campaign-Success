<p><b>We want you to help us improve safety at sea and save lives, save ships, save the environment.<br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why?</b><br/></p>
<p>More than 90 per cent of the world's trade is carried aboard ships. The computer equipment on which you are reading this was almost certainly transported by ships manned by some of the world's 500,000 seafarers. Your refrigerator and, probably, much of the food you store in it, reached you aboard ship. Their work is all around you.<br/></p>
<p>What happens to them affects you, whether you are in the maritime industry or not.<br/></p>
<p>Chances are that you only hear about those ships when an accident happens, lives are lost, vessels founder, the environment damaged by oil leaks. Maritime Accident Casebook sets out to reduce that toll by reaching out to seafarers in an entertaining language they can understand to help them work safer and navigate more safely, at at no cost to the seafarer.</p>
<p>By crowdfunding Maritime Accident Casebook we also give seafarers a direct involvement in their safety.<br/></p>
<p><b>Who?</b></p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maritime Accident Casebook</a> was launched in summer 2006. It reaches out to seafarers through podcasts, case studies and safety information presented in a lively, easy-to-understand way. It posts new material daily.<br/></p>
<p>It is known for its forthright opinions, its pro-seafarer stance, and its sometimes bumptious nature.</p>
<p>It has become respected by seafarers and maritime safety personnel and is regarded as a credible source of safety-related information.</p>
<p>It is independent, does not accept advertising and does not publish press releases or product/service puff pieces. It does not charge a subscription.<br/></p>
<p>In addition to its own site, Maritime Accident Casebook also leverages maritime social media to get its messages out, reaching 7,000 seafarers and maritime professionals each moth, and manages the 7,000-strong member Linkedin group for maritime safety and investigation. </p>
<p>Until now Maritime Accident Casebook has been a voluntary labour of love, a personal unpaid mission. Now we want to do more - developing new ways of reaching seafarers through different media and doing it better and more professionally.</p>
<p>That is why we are reaching out to you to help us save lives, save ships and save the environment.</p>
<p><b>What Next?</b><br/></p>
<p>We're seeking $35k of sponsorship and support. That will:</p>
<p>Allow for building a small audio studio for more professional podcasts.<br/></p>
<p>Allow selected podcast to be presented as animated videos.</p>
<p>Develop the SafeSpace project on enclosed/confined space safety.<br/></p>
<p>Allow for one full time administrator/writer/editor</p>
<p>Allow additional freelance writers to be recruited.</p>
<p>Create three books of case studies, with quizzes, covering confined space entry, lifeboats and mooring operations. To be available free of charge in ebook format and at low cost in hard copy.</p>
<p>Your onsite perks, sponsor's messages, appear when you have logged your contribution, good for one year from 1 October 2014.<br/></p>
<p><b>Plan B</b></p>
<p>If we don't reach our target then we will prioritise what we can do with what we have to get the safety message out. We will honour the perks, of course.  New writers and analysts who work the way we do are a priority. We may need to reduce the number of new podcasts and deelay plans for animated podcasts. All sponsors will be advised of how we intend to deal with the shortfall if it occurs. <br/></p>
<p>All accounts will be available to sponsors to ensure that they can see that we're doing our due diligence in a transparent way.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As you know, our motto is ""Finding and Facilitating the Best Exotic Free Energy Technologies"" -- a quest we've been on for nearly 11 years now. And as you will see in our listing at <a href=""http://Top5Energy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://Top5Energy.com</a>, there are indeed many very promising technologies getting very close to market, with newcomers to the quest arriving quite regularly.<br/><br/>No one else out there is providing the kind of coverage that we have been providing for over a decade, though there are a few specialized news services emerging in specific areas, especially LENR. We cover the spectrum of exotic (and sometimes conventional) free energy breakthroughs.<br/><br/>We would like to get to a point where we don't need to do any fundraisers for PES. We present here a couple of things we'll be pursuing to reach that objective in the fairly short term, even before some of these technologies emerge into the marketplace where we can benefit from the role we've playing in facilitating their success.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are some of the wants and needs we have -- how we will be using your funds. We hope to far surpass the fundraising goal, both to increase our ability to develop a self-sustaining revenue stream, and at least to lengthen the time until we need to do another fundraiser.</p>
<p>ONGOING</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing our daily <a href=""http://FreeEnergyNews.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free energy news</a> coverage, tackling those subjects that seem to us to be the most promising, keeping you abreast of these developments.</li>
<li>Networking with inventors, investors, businessmen, potential licensees, other media, and engineers to help facilitate the forward movement of the most promising technologies so they can be made available to you (and the rest of humanity) more rapidly.</li>
</ul>
NEW PROJECTS
<ul>
<li>We have secured the previously-unclaimed domain name <a href=""http://FreeEnergyMall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://<strong>FreeEnergyMall</strong>.com</a>, and we would like to find someone who can spearhead and manage a website that measures up to this name. This could be a great revenue source for our network as well as a great service to you.</li>
<li>We would like to launch a <strong>FE Translation Network</strong>, headed by a linguist who can oversee the various translators. What they will do is translate our content into their target language, and share in the advertising revenue from that content. It's a win-win-win. The new audience benefits from having access to the content, the translator wins by receiving revenue for their efforts, we win by receiving a share of that revenue to help finance our operations. This can also open up new sources of information for our news and network. Already, more than half of our traffic comes from outside the U.S. due to our recognition that this is a global effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>VETTING TRIP</p>
<ul>
<li>In the next few weeks, I would like to travel to Florida ($650 budgeted) to see <a href=""http://pesn.com/2013/04/20/9602298_Zeero_Power_Looking_to_Commercialize_their_Mechanical_Advantage_Machine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Milan Condric's force multiplier system</a> that has allegedly been third party tested to produce 650+ HP. It uses a combination of pneumatics, wind, mechanical, and another type of energy source to create a base-load capable system that would be very cheap once commercialized. Under NDA, I've seen three videos of it in operation. I would like to be able to see the third-party report, and see the system in operation for myself, so I can have more confidence when approaching potential investors about looking into the technology. If it checks out, it is a potential candidate for our Top 5 listing. I plan on also publishing a report on my trip and what I've seen, without disclosing the details of the mechanism, for your benefit.</li>
</ul>
<p>PAY BACK LOAN</p>
<ul>
<li>In December, we received a loan for $2000. He was hoping to let it slide for longer, but due to unfolding circumstances, he needs to get it back asap. We will be paying him from our tax return. Also, I still owe another person who loaned us $3000 last October. We don't have enough in our tax return to cover both of these.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The arrival of even one of these exotic free energy technologies into the marketplace will radically transform the world. Several of them are getting very close. Our coverage and networking has been playing a pivotal role in helping to move these things closer to fruition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring hope to people that solutions are on their way and in process of emerging.</li>
<li>It's ""power to the people,"" empowering people by their not having to worry about electricity and fuel for their homes, businesses, and transportation. This will free them up to pursue what they are really good at, as opposed to having to work for others doing things that are not in alignment with their true talents and destiny.</li>
<li>It disempowers the powers that be, rendering them obsolete.</li>
<li>Clean up the planet.</li>
<li>(This list could be very long, but you get the idea.)</li>
</ul>

What We Need & What You Get
Here are some of the wants and needs we have -- how we will be using your funds. We hope to far surpass the fundraising goal, both to increase our ability to develop a self-sustaining revenue stream, and at least to lengthen the time until we need to do another fundraiser.
ONGOING

Continuing our daily free energy news coverage, tackling those subjects that seem to us to be the most promising, keeping you abreast of these developments.
Networking with inventors, investors, businessmen, potential licensees, other media, and engineers to help facilitate the forward movement of the most promising technologies so they can be made available to you (and the rest of humanity) more rapidly.

NEW PROJECTS

We have secured the previously-unclaimed domain name http://FreeEnergyMall.com, and we would like to find someone who can spearhead and manage a website that measures up to this name. This could be a great revenue source for our network as well as a great service to you.

In December, we received a loan for $2000. He was hoping to let it slide for longer, but due to unfolding circumstances, he needs to get it back asap. We will be paying him from our tax return. Also, I still owe another person who loaned us $3000 last October. We don't have enough in our tax return to cover both of these.



The Impact
The arrival of even one of these exotic free energy technologies into the marketplace will radically transform the world. Several of them are getting very close. Our coverage and networking has been playing a pivotal role in helping to move these things closer to fruition.

Bring hope to people that solutions are on their way and in process of emerging.
It's ""power to the people,"" empowering people by their not having to worry about electricity and fuel for their homes, businesses, and transportation. This will free them up to pursue what they are really good at, as opposed to having to work for others doing things that are not in alignment with their true talents and destiny.
It disempowers the powers that be, rendering them obsolete.
Clean up the planet.
(This list could be very long, but you get the idea.)

</div><br/></div>","The Bungalo Project,
Restoring lost charm and romance to a 1926 home.

The History
To fully appreciate this project's restoration for the future is to take just a few short moments to learn of its very interesting background.  Follow with me in exploring through a brief paragraph a quick journey of the history associated with this home.


  During the War of 1812 a certain Joshua Martin, a Private in Captain Willoughby Morgan’s
Company of the 12th U.S. Regiment of Infantry, lost his life fighting for our young country.  His mother, Temperance Cowan,
subsequently laid survivor’s claim to 160 acres given free and clear to each of those fighting in
the war.  On September 17, 1818 those 160 acres of land with
legal description of “The North East Quarter of Section 33 of Township 9N of
Range 8E” in the Tract appropriated for Military Bounties in the Territory of
Illinois were passed on to her from the lands of the United States via an
instrument called a Land Patent with her being the first owner of this land
passed on from the United States Government to a private citizen.  Ownership of the original 160
acres upon which this house sits, but which has long since been subdivided into lots for individual houses, even predates incorporated Peoria, Illinois.  It took seventeen more years before Peoria, Illinois
was incorporated as a town in 1835.  A copy of that original Land
Patent signed by Josiah Meigs, the second Commissioner of the United States
Land Office serving under only the fifth President of the United State of America James Monroe is below.


  And it is now that
we fast forward in a journey through time one-hundred and eight years later.  The year is 1926 and the area where once the wild prairie reigned supreme was becoming no more.
The Romance:
It is now 1926.  Satchel Paige makes his pitching debut; The first check was sent across the Atlantic by radio FAX; Thomas Edison stated Americans prefer silent movies over talkies;  Babe Ruth hits 3 Home Runs in the World Series;  Disney Brothers Cartoon Studios becomes Walt Disney Studios and an architectural style of home described as the American Bungalo at 411 E. McClure Avenue in Peoria, Illinois welcomed its first owners Willis K and his wife Cora A. Brown.  Eighty-eight years ago now and with a very excited husband and wife this home started its own set of memories and if it could only talk would surely tell us of the happiness and the many children playing in its rooms spanning these many years as it now quickly approaches one entire century of families having once called it ""home.""  And from a distance even now seen through the eye of a Robert Frost ""Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening"" one can peer into the past and see it as it seemingly and proudly once was.  Yes, as it seemingly once was but only though if viewed from a distance.

But as is the legacy of any home Willis and Cora, due their advancing ages, moved on and in the many years to follow time took its relentless toll on the home.The toll of time:
But in the real world homes can't talk.  Time tolled relentlessly both internally and externally.  Today it stands and, through a small sampling of images in the picture gallery ( click on the ""Gallery 17"" tab at the top of this page ), with a much closer look now one can start to see it has indeed weathered many sad events in its life.  Still structurally sound but needing much tender loving care for it to see another eighty-eight years here is an opportunity to join with others through your contribution to breathe new life into her.

<p>Open fires are an inefficient use of biomass, such as wood and

Ice911 is a 501(c)3 nonprofit whose research, development and field work have reached an advanced stage in providing solutions to slow one of the accelerating factors in global temperature rise: Arctic ice melt. By increasing the ice’s reflectiveness, we can help restore the Earth’s natural heat shield in the Arctic, rebuild polar habitat and help stabilize global climate.  We have developed this solution in a way that we can remove/reverse anything we do, an extremely important feature we've built into our approach from the beginning.Our work is meant to reduce the devastating impacts of global climate change to buy the world much-needed time to implement the longer-term solution of wide-spread conservation and sustainable energy measures. Now it’s time to head to the Arctic - and we can't get there without you.  You can be a true Ice Hero and help us slow climate change's devastating 
effects as we take the next step to place our first Arctic 
demonstration area in Barrow, Alaska by donating today.  You'll get some cool perks too!  We only have 3 days left - if you can donate and spread the word today to your networks, we can do this!
A Global Problem:  Reflective
ice in the Arctic has melted with shocking speed over the last few decades. 
(Satellite
images from the work of Rigor and Wallace.) Though this may at first seem a
problem far removed from our daily lives, the consequences of the melt are
serious and costly for the entire world, leading to 1/3 of global temperature
rise from increased absorption of sunlight during the Arctic summer, as well as
contributing to rising sea levels and more devastating storms. The Arctic ice cap is melting. We have lost over 2 million square kilometers of Arctic sea ice in just 30 years (nsidc.org) in a vicious climate cycle. As the Arctic gets warmer, a great deal of reflective white “multi-year” ice has been lost, changing the landscape from highly reflective white ice to darker ""young"" ice and open seawater. The multi-year bright ice the Arctic has lost reflected much more sunlight, and when we had more of the bright ice, it was better able to keep the Arctic and the rest of the Earth cooler.With shrinking quantities of this reflective multi-year ice, more and more ice is lost every year. Breaking this cycle (the Ice-Albedo Feedback Effect) can slow the destructive loss of Arctic ice and reduce the devastating effects of climate change. One solution to reduce the melt is is to change the reflectiveness of some areas of the ice in a local and reversible way to increase the ability to reflect sunlight. Enter Ice911 and its team of dedicated engineers and scientists.
Solution: Ice911 has developed short-term and
reversible measures to reduce the far-reaching effects of the loss of
reflective Arctic ice.  The idea seems
simple, but as with most important engineering projects, it has taken years of
development and field testing to work out many important details. We have
succeeded in satisfying our important guiding rules: We have developed a way to
locally replace the reflectivity of the lost multi-year ice in selected areas,
using materials and techniques to First Do No Harm, and with the ability to
reverse or remove the materials or effects later.  We can rebuild lost ice reflectivity, and perhaps
even reboot the ice by restarting the natural processes to regrow multi-year
reflective ice, and it can potentially provide 
interim habitat for polar bears and other Arctic animals as well.Methods: Two
very workable methods have been developed: Use a safe floatable bright material
in a granular form as an ice and snow covering, packaged to protect the environment against any unintended impacts; or freeze a safe ingredient from the kitchen into
the ice itself to make it bright.  NASA has confirmed that Ice911’s bright ice dramatically
slows ice melt. Both methods have important
benefits, and we are seeking to get both demonstrated in small-scale field
tests in the Arctic as soon as possible in the upcoming Winter/Spring season to
inform any decisions for wider deployment to save Arctic ice.We have developed rigorous, science-based solutions to preserve polar and glacial ice, as well as our own in-house monitoring system to measure the the effectiveness of our materials and the weather conditions at our deployment sites. Solar Weather Ice Monitoring Station (SWIMS), designed by Ice911's Satish Chetty.Artist's rendition of a SWIMS buoy in action, transmitting real-time weather and ice thickness and brightness data atop a rebuilt, bright ice sheet.Our immediate goal is to place our first Arctic demonstration area in Barrow, Alaska, starting our deployment in January 2015.  We've done our homework, having gathered on-the-spot information in Alaska on  the logistics, permitting, and budget needed to do do this work, and we're readying ourselves to go.

783 million people lack access to an improved source of drinking water—that's 1 in 9 of us. In the places we work, it's more like 1 in 2.
Many women spend 20 hours per week collecting water, some walking 7 miles a day, often for contaminated water. Too often the walk is not safe for them physically. It is women and the children they raise who suffer most without water, and who benefit most from access to it.
Globally, water-related diseases steal 443 million school days a year. Roundworm, whipworm, and hookworm stunt growth, cause debilitating anemia, and follow kids into the classroom, shrinking cognitive potential. Illness causes absenteeism and early drop-out. Simple solutions can keep kids in school.

<p> </p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Could it really be true that there is such a thing as an <strong>all-magnet motor</strong> that can provide rotational torque for useful energy generation, with no apparent input other than what nature provides through principles of magnetism not yet fully understood? Modern science emphatically says ""NO"", but many inventors over the years have claimed to have defied that prediction, by building working motors.<br/><br/> Now, at the upcoming 41st International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva from April 10-14, 2013, the world may have a chance to see such a motor.<br/><br/> The Turkish patent office has <a href=""http://pureenergyblog.com/2013/02/26/turkish-patent-institute-invites-yildiz-to-geneva-inventions-conference/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">invited</a> inventor Muammer Yildiz, to whom they awarded such a patent, to display his all-magnet motor at that expo; and he has invited me to participate in that event.</p>
<p>As many of you who follow our Free Energy News know, I've been closely tracking the Yildiz all-magnet motor for the past few months, both in keeping a <a href=""http://peswiki.com/index.php/Event:2013:Validating_Muammer_Yildiz%27_Magnet_Motor_for_30_Days_at_European_University"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> about it at PESWiki updated, as well as in helping to facilitate things through my interactions with the various players, including the inventor; his assistant, Halil Turkmen; the documentary film maker, Rene van der Woude of <a href=""http://www.mixr.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mixr.nl</a>; Dr. Jorge Duarte of Eindhoven University, who has been vouching for this technology....<br/><br/> We all, especially the inventor, are anxious to finally see this technology class vindicated once and for all, to never be doubted again.<br/><br/> This would be the beginning of a new scientific and energy revolution -- a paradigm crasher, an eye opener, and the opening of a new path forward in providing clean solutions to the world's energy problems.<br/><br/> With all the interactions I have had on this, many of them confidential, I am very certain about the reality of Mr. Yildiz's motor design being real.<br/><br/>One of the team members I have been in communication with is a <strong>Ph.D. student</strong> at a European university. He is doing his dissertation on ""overunity"" systems that go beyond presently-understood laws of physics. The student doesn't yet want his identity or the identity of the university to be publicly known, though I know who they are, and can vouch that they are credible. I saw a letter of reference from the mentoring professor approving the student to participate in the Geneva expo on behalf of the university.</p>
<p>At first, we were hoping to just connect the shaft of the motor to an alternator to power a 1000-W bank of lights. However, Mr. Yildiz decided against doing that due to an experience he's had in the past where such a set-up was done, and the shafts were not properly aligned, and it damaged his motor, requiring him to take it apart, taking several hours to repair it.</p>
<p>Mr. Yildiz doesn't want that to happen while the world is watching at the expo. So he wants to play it safe by just running a 25 cm fan blade, which consumes around 380 Watts at the speed he runs it at. This he knows to be a stable configuration, which will easily hold up.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, ""How can we measure that fan in real time?""</p>
<p>The student has proposed a <strong>very simple set-up</strong>, as shown in the diagram. He would use a Plexiglass tube to direct the incoming air to a fan blade mounted at the back of the tube, which would turn a dynamo and power a small light.</p>
<p>The reason for the ~1 meter separation of the apparatus from the motor is that Yildiz says that ferrous material interferes with the function of the motor, and needs to be at least that far away.</p>
<p>Such a measurement would only be about 20% efficient, so a 380-Watt source would power an 80-Watt bulb. (Good solar panels are only 20% efficient in turning the sun's energy into electricity.)</p>
<p>The purpose for this set-up would not be to give an accurate measurement, but just to <strong>provide a reality check</strong>, showing by measurement that the output of the motor is indeed in the range that the inventor says it is.</p>
<p>Accurate measurements are planned to take place after the Geneva expo, in lab settings.</p>
<p><strong>What we want to demonstrate</strong> at the Geneva expo is that the magnet motor does work, and that it runs for a period of time longer than what could be achieved if there were some kind of batteries or other energy storage mechanism being utilized inside the motor casing.</p>
<p>For the size of the motor, the most likely energy storage would be lithium ion batteries. And if the motor body was full of lithium ion batteries, the amount of power it could produce would be 1700 watt-hours. So in order to fully satisfy the skeptics, the demonstration of Yildiz' motor needs to be for at least long enough to surpass that amount of power.</p>
<p>So if the motor is producing 380 Watts, then it would need to run for 4.5 hours to achieve a 1700 watt-hour output. And the expo is open for 9 hours each day -- twice that time, providing ample evidence that the motor is indeed being powered by something that present science cannot account for.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Yildiz could just run the motor and fan without this measurement apparatus, but people would have to thrust his word that the output is equivalent to 380 Watts. But if we were going on trust, then we wouldn't need the demo, right?</p>
<p>So, <em><strong>the purpose of this fundraiser is to reimburse the expense of building this measurement apparatus</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Ph.D. Student is going to build this, whether or not we help him with the expenses. However, he would greatly appreciate it if we (we the people) could reimburse him, so that he can keep those funds in his kitty for other overunity projects he is investigating and documenting for his Ph.D. That's why I present this as a ""flexible funding"" campaign, so he keeps whatever is raised.</p>
<p>So help us spread the word. If we raise the full amount budgeted, then Indiegogo only keeps 4%. But if we don't reach the goal, they retain 7%</p>

Description
Could it really be true that there is such a thing as an all-magnet motor that can provide rotational torque for useful energy generation, with no apparent input other than what nature provides through principles of magnetism not yet fully understood? Modern science emphatically says ""NO"", but many inventors over the years have claimed to have defied that prediction, by building working motors. Now, at the upcoming 41st International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva from April 10-14, 2013, the world may have a chance to see such a motor. The Turkish patent office has invited inventor Muammer Yildiz, to whom they awarded such a patent, to display his all-magnet motor at that expo; and he has invited me to participate in that event.
As many of you who follow our Free Energy News know, I've been closely tracking the Yildiz all-magnet motor for the past few months, both in keeping a blog about it at PESWiki updated, as well as in helping to facilitate things through my interactions with the various players, including the inventor; his assistant, Halil Turkmen; the documentary film maker, Rene van der Woude of http://www.mixr.nl; Dr. Jorge Duarte of Eindhoven University, who has been vouching for this technology.... We all, especially the inventor, are anxious to finally see this technology class vindicated once and for all, to never be doubted again. This would be the beginning of a new scientific and energy revolution -- a paradigm crasher, an eye opener, and the opening of a new path forward in providing clean solutions to the world's energy problems. With all the interactions I have had on this, many of them confidential, I am very certain about the reality of Mr. Yildiz's motor design being real.One of the team members I have been in communication with is a Ph.D. student at a European university. He is doing his dissertation on ""overunity"" systems that go beyond presently-understood laws of physics. The student doesn't yet want his identity or the identity of the university to be publicly known, though I know who they are, and can vouch that they are credible. I saw a letter of reference from the mentoring professor approving the student to participate in the Geneva expo on behalf of the university.
At first, we were hoping to just connect the shaft of the motor to an alternator to power a 1000-W bank of lights. However, Mr. Yildiz decided against doing that due to an experience he's had in the past where such a set-up was done, and the shafts were not properly aligned, and it damaged his motor, requiring him to take it apart, taking several hours to repair it.
Mr. Yildiz doesn't want that to happen while the world is watching at the expo. So he wants to play it safe by just running a 25 cm fan blade, which consumes around 380 Watts at the speed he runs it at. This he knows to be a stable configuration, which will easily hold up.
The question then becomes, ""How can we measure that fan in real time?""
The student has proposed a very simple set-up, as shown in the diagram. He would use a Plexiglass tube to direct the incoming air to a fan blade mounted at the back of the tube, which would turn a dynamo and power a small light.
The reason for the ~1 meter separation of the apparatus from the motor is that Yildiz says that ferrous material interferes with the function of the motor, and needs to be at least that far away.
Such a measurement would only be about 20% efficient, so a 380-Watt source would power an 80-Watt bulb. (Good solar panels are only 20% efficient in turning the sun's energy into electricity.)
The purpose for this set-up would not be to give an accurate measurement, but just to provide a reality check, showing by measurement that the output of the motor is indeed in the range that the inventor says it is.
Accurate measurements are planned to take place after the Geneva expo, in lab settings.
What we want to demonstrate at the Geneva expo is that the magnet motor does work, and that it runs for a period of time longer than what could be achieved if there were some kind of batteries or other energy storage mechanism being utilized inside the motor casing.
For the size of the motor, the most likely energy storage would be lithium ion batteries. And if the motor body was full of lithium ion batteries, the amount of power it could produce would be 1700 watt-hours.

Of course, Mr. Yildiz could just run the motor and fan without this measurement apparatus, but people would have to thrust his word that the output is equivalent to 380 Watts. But if we were going on trust, then we wouldn't need the demo, right?
So, the purpose of this fundraiser is to reimburse the expense of building this measurement apparatus.
The Ph.D. Student is going to build this, whether or not we help him with the expenses.

So help us spread the word. If we raise the full amount budgeted, then Indiegogo only keeps 4%. But if we don't reach the goal, they retain 7%

Der AnlassThe
Cause
SHIFTING VALUES ist eine in Österreich ansässige,
international tätige und aktive Kampagnenagentur, die die Fortsetzung der
unabhängigen wissenschaftlichen Arbeit von StudentInnen des Far East Russia Orca Project(FEROP) und
ihren Schutzbemühungen für Orcas und andere Meeressäuger in Gewässern in
Ostrussland unterstützt. Zu diesem Zweck starten wir die Initiative „Running
for Orcas 2015“. Unser Team und begeisterungsfähige Freunde und Interessierte nehmen
das Martyrium auf sich und nehmen am 12.April am Wien-Marathon teil. Wir nutzen
den Anlass, um für die Erforschung und den Schutz der Orcas in russischen
Gewässern zu werben und bitten Dich um Deine Unterstützung!
SHIFTING VALUES, an
Austrian based and international active campaigning agency, supports the
continued efforts by Russian students and researchers of the Far East Russia Orca Project (FEROP) to
protect orcas as well as other marine wildlife in Far East Russia by initiating
the event ""Running for Orcas 2015"". In 2015, the agency engages in
contributing towards orca conservation and is organizing a team to use its
participation at the Vienna City Marathon to launch a crowdfunding initiative
in support of the continued independent research and orca conservation
initiatives in Russia.
Orcas, der größte Delfin und König der MeereOrcas, the largest dolphin and top
predator in our oceans
Der Orca, auch bekannt als
Killerwal, ist die größte Delfinart. Orcas zählen zu den am besten erforschten
Meeressäugern und stehen am Ende der Nahrungskette. Wissenschaftler haben bei
Orcas unterschiedliche Kulturen identifiziert, die unterschiedliche Dialekte
und Nahrungsgewohnheiten, sowie Gruppenzusammensetzungen haben. Ihre
Einzigartigkeit macht sie zu den idealen Botschaftern für die Einrichtung von
Schutzzonen.
Orcas, also known as
killer whales (the largest dolphin species), are traditionally considered to be
among the most clever and beautiful sea creatures, and one of the fastest and
strongest, with no predators of its own. In the world’s oceans, orcas have
evolved into different cultures performing different dialects, social groupings
and diets. This makes them one of the most outstanding research “subjects” but
at the same time “Ambassadors” for protecting ocean habitats and marine
biodiversity.
FEROP – Das ProjektFEROP - The Project

Die ostrussischen Gewässer
sind  eine der wenigen Regionen in denen
Orcas weiterhin für die Showzwecke  gefangen werden. Die in den vergangenen Jahren
seitens des FEROP Teams veröffentlichten wissenschaftlichen Daten werden auch
genutzt, um entsprechende Schutzmaßnahmen zu entwickeln. Der Fang und die
Haltung von Orcas in Gefangenschaft sind in keiner Weise zu rechtfertigen. 
Russia is one of the
few regions where orcas have been captured in recent years. The FEROP Team, made
of young, passionate Russian scientists has been extremely active in publishing
scientific results about their findings and orcas in the wild and at the same
time calling for stricter conservation measures, including the prohibition of
orca captures.

Shifting Values and Orcas

Gemeinsam mit FEROP veröffentlichte Shifting Values im
Frühjahr 2012 Kenntnis und Bildmaterial des von FEROP identifizierten rein
weißen Orca-Bullen „Iceberg“ und sorgte für globale Berichterstattung.
2014 organisierte SHIFTING VALUES die einzigen offiziellen
Kinovorstellung des Dokumentarfilms BLACKFISH in Österreich
In spring 2012 Shifting
Values in close cooperation with FEROP released information and images of the
existence of a unique completely white orca bull identified by FEROP which
resulted in global media coverage.
In 2014, SHIFTING VALUES
brought the documentary BLACKFISH to Austria, organizing a few selective
screenings of this exposure documentary which caused significant problems for
the amusement park industry, in particular Sea World.

But I'm more than just a title on paper; I consider myself a voice of the animals. Ever since I was a little girl, I had a passion for helping lost pets or injured wildlife and dreams of one day helping to save all species from extinction. Now I know that <i>all</i> is a bit extreme, and life sometimes doesn't put the opportunity at your fingertips. You have to be willing to reach out and find it, even if your career  or family or other pursuits take up the bulk of your time. </p>
<p>Even though I'm not working as a zoologist or marine biologist (yet), I still want to use what talents and time I have to help make a difference. Because I believe that even the smallest effort or contribution can change the future and help save animal lives.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Polar Bear</h3>
<div>Polar bears naturally populate areas of arctic sea ice like Northern Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway. But as the climate warms, the sea ice disappears - melting earlier and forming later each year. This places the polar bear in jeopardy as the species cannot travel its natural paths, hunt, or teach the next generation crucial survival skills. Habitat loss has already shown a direct impact on polar bear health and numbers. Skinny and hungry bears face a harsher challenge each and every year, through no fault of their own and without a way to speak for themselves.<br/>
</div>
<div>It's up to us to speak for them and to act on their behalf. From signing a petition that urges climate change to modifying your own habits to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, you can make a difference. By donating to this project, you are showing your support for research and outreach to help save polar bears.</div>
<h3>The Project</h3> <p>This past year, I've begun painting animal portraits. I am contributing my original artwork to help raise awareness and money for the polar bear, just one of the many animals in the world whose lives are in jeopardy and whose species might ultimately face extinction. Every dollar of the net amount raised will go directly to the ""<a href=""http://gifts.worldwildlife.org/gift-center/gifts/Species-Adoptions/Polar-Bear.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/polar-bear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adopt a Polar Bear</a>"" cause hosted by the World Wildlife Fund.</p>
<p>I have never sold or contributed a single painting to a cause before, so this will be an experimental project for me. I know that there are more talented artists out there, but just like actual polar bears, each piece of polar bear art is unique. This is the only venue through which you can donate funds and in return receive this one-of-a-kind piece. Each art print and painting will be hand signed and numbered by me as part of a limited edition set. You can choose to hang the piece on your office or bedroom wall. Each time you look at it, you can remember how you contributed to the cause and how you are a voice for the polar bear. OR you can gift it to a loved one who shares your passion for animals!<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With this project, I hope to raise money for a great cause while simultaneously spreading the word that polar bears are still a threatened species (since 2008). They may not be in the news or face immediate extinction, but that doesn't make the cause any less worthy of notice. </p>

</div></div>","Who I Am and Why I Care I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in Biology with an Ecology and Animal Behavior emphasis. But I'm more than just a title on paper; I consider myself a voice of the animals. Ever since I was a little girl, I had a passion for helping lost pets or injured wildlife and dreams of one day helping to save all species from extinction. Now I know that all is a bit extreme, and life sometimes doesn't put the opportunity at your fingertips. You have to be willing to reach out and find it, even if your career  or family or other pursuits take up the bulk of your time. 
Even though I'm not working as a zoologist or marine biologist (yet), I still want to use what talents and time I have to help make a difference. Because I believe that even the smallest effort or contribution can change the future and help save animal lives.   The Polar Bear
Polar bears naturally populate areas of arctic sea ice like Northern Canada, Russia, Greenland, and Norway. But as the climate warms, the sea ice disappears - melting earlier and forming later each year. This places the polar bear in jeopardy as the species cannot travel its natural paths, hunt, or teach the next generation crucial survival skills. Habitat loss has already shown a direct impact on polar bear health and numbers. Skinny and hungry bears face a harsher challenge each and every year, through no fault of their own and without a way to speak for themselves.

It's up to us to speak for them and to act on their behalf. From signing a petition that urges climate change to modifying your own habits to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, you can make a difference. By donating to this project, you are showing your support for research and outreach to help save polar bears.
The Project This past year, I've begun painting animal portraits. I am contributing my original artwork to help raise awareness and money for the polar bear, just one of the many animals in the world whose lives are in jeopardy and whose species might ultimately face extinction. Every dollar of the net amount raised will go directly to the ""Adopt a Polar Bear"" cause hosted by the World Wildlife Fund.
I have never sold or contributed a single painting to a cause before, so this will be an experimental project for me. I know that there are more talented artists out there, but just like actual polar bears, each piece of polar bear art is unique. This is the only venue through which you can donate funds and in return receive this one-of-a-kind piece. Each art print and painting will be hand signed and numbered by me as part of a limited edition set. You can choose to hang the piece on your office or bedroom wall. Each time you look at it, you can remember how you contributed to the cause and how you are a voice for the polar bear. OR you can gift it to a loved one who shares your passion for animals!
    The Impact With this project, I hope to raise money for a great cause while simultaneously spreading the word that polar bears are still a threatened species (since 2008). They may not be in the news or face immediate extinction, but that doesn't make the cause any less worthy of notice. 

    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you cannot donate money, you can still help remind your friends and family by sharing this project through Facebook, Twitter, and any other way you deem fit.

<div>
<div>We (Nico's family) are currently involved in a lengthy application process through a local organization called NEADS (National Education for Assistance Dog Services). We expect to have a completed and approved application for Nico's dog through NEADS this coming Spring, 2013. Once the application is approved, we will move all of the donations collated through this website over to NEADS in Nico's name. This means that your donation through this website is tax deductible as NEADS is a 501c3 nonprofit organization.

<div>NEADS (National Education for Assistance Dog Services) – also known as Dogs for Deaf and Disabled Americans – is a non-profit organization that was established in 1976 to provide canine assistance for people who are deaf or have a disability.

<div> </div>
<div><strong>How This Will Help</strong></div>
<div>Before we began this application, we had multiple conversations with Nico about what it means to own and care for a service dog. We wanted to be certain that Nico was ready and willing to take on the responsibilities involved. We asked Nico a number of questions to this end, and his answers all indicated that he will be ready and eager to accept responsibility.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In his own words:</div>
<div>“The main reason I want a service dog is it will help me be more independent. The other main reason I want a service dog is to comfort me when I am sad. When people around me are talking and laughing, I sometimes get sad. The dog can help me with that. Like a friend.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nico also shared how the dog might also help him with some basic needs that he’s not able to do independently:</div>
<div>“He/she will help me turn on the fan and the light switch. The dog can also help me when transferring from my wheelchair, and with carrying my sports equipment.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As his family, we're with Nico every day and we know that the ways in which a service dog will benefit and enrich his life are innumerable. At 11-years-old, we find Nico facing one of the greatest challenges of life — learning to be independent with a disability. He’s become more aware of his body and emotions, and understandably feels a heightened need for more control over his actions and day-to-day needs. Impaired by both physical and cognitive disabilities, we can’t think of any better tool than a service dog to help him achieve this goal. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some examples of how we know this service dog will help Nico include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Finding help in an emergency situation by either fetching the phone so Nico can call for help or barking when commanded by Nico to attract attention.</li>
<li>Helping Nico move between spaces as well as transferring from his wheelchair without adult assistance.</li>
<li>Helping Nico access out-of-reach items as well as carrying items for him.</li>
<li>Above all, being an emotional support for Nico, who suffers with anxiety, a sensory disorder, and a non-verbal learning disability. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>1.6 billion people around the world live without electricity or require an alternative because electricity is too expensive and power outages are daily events. We developed a low-cost, solar-powered, folding light made of a recyclable material. It has a lifespan of 3-5 years and provides light for 8-12 hours. Our patented origami balloon folding design allows it to be flat packed for easy transport. It can be charged by the sun while folded or when expanded.</p>
<p>Our folding lamp provides enough light to study with at night and can light up a room up to 100 square feet. Many solar portable lamps are produced with emergency situations in mind. As a result, the light quality is not conducive for daily use as an alternative to electricity. Our lamp provides a quality of light that works for both task and ambient light. </p>
<p>Our light is one of the lightest weight portable lights made and, because it folds, it can be easily packed by the hundreds and shipped at a low cost for emergency relief situations. It is durable and reliable in extreme weather conditions.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have had success with the introduction of our earlier prototypes and are now seeking your hlep to produce our final prototype and make it available to people  in need. We are seeking $30,00 to complete the following:</p>
<p>Circuit board tooling: $2,000</p>
<p>Envelope refinement and tooling: $5,000</p>
<p>Final prototype development: $2,500</p>
<p>3-country household test: $20,500</p>
<p>Total: 30,000</p>
<p>One key aspect of finalizing our solar light is the inclusion of phone charging capability. Today, nearly 500 million people worldwide have a mobile phone subscription but no easy or cheap access to a means of charging it.</p>
<p>We will use whatever monies we raise to continue with the following steps:</p>
<p>First, we will complete the final prototype. This includes phone charging capability; brighter light capacity; and a more durable envelope construction.</p>
<p>Second, we will complete our in-country testings. Our plan is to work with NGOs with whom our nonprofit already has established relationships to help  distribute the lights. We expect that we will conduct tests in locations in the Caribbean, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Finally, we will secure agreements with NGOs to incorporate our solar light as part of their their existing programs. We've already begun these conversation and have some commitments underway.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While governments are working to increase access to electricity, the global population is growing faster than the rate of electrification. It is expensive and sometimes not technically feasible to provide electricity in some areas. Even when electricity does reach a village or town, customers may be asked to pay steep fees to establish service. Even when connected to the grid, power outages are a daily occurrence in the developing world. In Africa, more than one-third of the connected population experience power loss at least once a week, lasting anywhere between a couple of hours to days at a time.</p>
<p>Currently, the majority of people with little or no access to electricity rely on kerosene for light. Kerosene lamps are known to be toxic, carcinogenic and inefficient. Kerosene-based lamps can contribute to lung disease, respiratory problems and eye-related issues. Reports by the World Health Organization indicate that indoor air pollution from kerosene and similar fuels used for indoor lighting and cooking cause more than 1.5 million deaths annually.</p>
<p>In addition, $10 billion a year is spent on kerosene in sub-Saharan Africa, or $36 billion globally. In Tanzania, for example, households often spend 10% to 25% of their income on kerosene.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Being part of the team means that we will explore the Antarctic Peninsula with onboard experts and gain firsthand knowledge of the continent’s fragile ecosystem. We will also experience the unique Antarctic wildlife and observe its magnificent landscape, all while learning about climate change, sustainability and what we can do to protect this last great wilderness on Earth.</p>
<p><br/>As you can imagine I am over the moon with excitement for having this truly once in a lifetime opportunity, most of all because since I was a little girl I have been fascinated with whales, and how disregarded of their size they are truly gentle magnificent creatures. Not only this, but as the last great wilderness on earth, and the furthest point there is a certain mysticism that I have always admired. To have the opportunity to go in this lifetime and raise awareness about the plight of animals such as the great whales that risk having their natural habitats depleted in the search for fuels, is truly an honour. Particularly as I get to do it whilst promoting the use of renewable energy, a zero waste lifestyle and the creation of job opportunities for youth along the way,</p>
<p>It is for this reason that I am reaching out for contributions to all those that believe in the protection of great animals like the whales. If animals are not your thing how about renewable energy? If that’s still doesn’t make the cut, how about show your support for the creation of youth employment? Whatever the reason you decide to sponsor me, I promise I will be eternally grateful!</p>
<p>In order to be able to participate I must fundraise <strong>$20 000 USD by December 1st, 2012</strong>. I need the funds to cover the cost of the expedition (15 000 USD), plus airfare and special clothing for the region. I realize that the amount to fundraise is quite a bit, nevertheless, if I am unable to fundraise enough funds, all of the money will go to our social enterprise where we seek to provide seed funding to young entrepreneurs who have innovative business ideas that are not only environmentally concious, but that are creating jobs, providing tranferrable skills, and which are ultimately leading their communities to achieving sustainable development. </p>
<h3>What I intend on doing as a result of my participation in the AYAP:</h3>
<p>Through one of my contacts in Brazil I have managed to begin to develop a tangible project for after the Ambassador Programme including the Zero Waste motto. The idea we have come up with will help safeguard the environment for future generations through a Zero Waste lifestyle, which will not only help ensure humankind’s survival but also for endangered species such as whales.</p>
<p><br/>We also want to educate people in countries that do not necessarily have a coast, or ‘political’ interest in Antarctica, given that a lot of the time just because people are not personally connected they do not know much about the situation and how it is that their lifestyle influences the outcomes in the polar regions. Perhaps, if they found out more in a personal manner and how it is through their actions that they affect international space, they might just listen and decide to lead more of a Zero Waste lifestyle.<br/>Finally, for us living a zero waste life, or having proper waste management infrastructure is key. Waste that is properly processed pollutes less, not only that, but if people become more conscious of the trash they are producing it helps reduce it. Alternatively, they can make better purchases such as products made out of recyclables. Added to this, is the idea of turning waste into energy as a renewable energy source is something that we believe in.</p>
<p><br/>Our target audience is mainly youth as that is the range of people we work for and have access to (ages 18-30). The project/campaign/idea will launch at this year’s Zero Waste International Youth Meeting to be hosted in Florianópolis by Zero Waste Youth, where youth from all over the world will be attending to find out how to spread the idea of Zero Waste and renewable energy in their respective countries. This will help us hit the ground running and start with a wide network in order to have the best impact. As a Zero Waste ambassador within the Antarctica programme I would document my experience through a photo essay/video and spread it through our social media channels to our already existing network. Eventually, the idea would be to lead to an action day in ever place where we have representation in order to raise awareness about Antarctica, renewable energy and a Zero Waste lifestyle, bringing it all full circle.</p>
<h3>
<span>Another project for after the Programme (hopefully!):</span> </h3>
<p><span>I have always been passionate about photography, and have become quite the travel photojournalist. I have always wanted to hold an exhibition for my photos, so I can share the stories of my life with others, and hopefully inspire them to follow their hearts and beat to their own drums in their own ways. And if through them I can inspire people to want to change the world, why not!? </span></p>
<p><span>I am quite the whale lover, and my dream has always been to swim with them in their natural environment (although I am not sure this will be able to happen this time around) I thought I could document this experience and add it to my other travel experiences, creating a Memoir of sorts (being that before 30 I will now have officially been to all continents) but mostly focus on the pressing issues all over the world  such as the rapid change of the environment. This would then be put into a photography exhibition, and perhaps into a photo book. </span></p>
<p>Contributions would most definitely help in making this idea into a reality. Whether big or small, any support will be of great encouragement as I move forward towards achieving this dream of mine, and ultimately, hopefully will also create a ripple effect that will contribute to the empowerment of youth around the world and the safe guarding of this great planet and all its living beings. </p>
<p>If unable to contribute financially, can I ask yout o please share my cause with others to help spread the word, and help me reach my target!? </p>

Through one of my contacts in Brazil I have managed to begin to develop a tangible project for after the Ambassador Programme including the Zero Waste motto. The idea we have come up with will help safeguard the environment for future generations through a Zero Waste lifestyle, which will not only help ensure humankind’s survival but also for endangered species such as whales.
We also want to educate people in countries that do not necessarily have a coast, or ‘political’ interest in Antarctica, given that a lot of the time just because people are not personally connected they do not know much about the situation and how it is that their lifestyle influences the outcomes in the polar regions. Perhaps, if they found out more in a personal manner and how it is through their actions that they affect international space, they might just listen and decide to lead more of a Zero Waste lifestyle.Finally, for us living a zero waste life, or having proper waste management infrastructure is key. Waste that is properly processed pollutes less, not only that, but if people become more conscious of the trash they are producing it helps reduce it. Alternatively, they can make better purchases such as products made out of recyclables. Added to this, is the idea of turning waste into energy as a renewable energy source is something that we believe in.
Our target audience is mainly youth as that is the range of people we work for and have access to (ages 18-30). The project/campaign/idea will launch at this year’s Zero Waste International Youth Meeting to be hosted in Florianópolis by Zero Waste Youth, where youth from all over the world will be attending to find out how to spread the idea of Zero Waste and renewable energy in their respective countries. This will help us hit the ground running and start with a wide network in order to have the best impact. As a Zero Waste ambassador within the Antarctica programme I would document my experience through a photo essay/video and spread it through our social media channels to our already existing network. Eventually, the idea would be to lead to an action day in ever place where we have representation in order to raise awareness about Antarctica, renewable energy and a Zero Waste lifestyle, bringing it all full circle.

Another project for after the Programme (hopefully!): 
I have always been passionate about photography, and have become quite the travel photojournalist. I have always wanted to hold an exhibition for my photos, so I can share the stories of my life with others, and hopefully inspire them to follow their hearts and beat to their own drums in their own ways. And if through them I can inspire people to want to change the world, why not!? 
I am quite the whale lover, and my dream has always been to swim with them in their natural environment (although I am not sure this will be able to happen this time around) I thought I could document this experience and add it to my other travel experiences, creating a Memoir of sorts (being that before 30 I will now have officially been to all continents) but mostly focus on the pressing issues all over the world  such as the rapid change of the environment. This would then be put into a photography exhibition, and perhaps into a photo book. 
Contributions would most definitely help in making this idea into a reality. Whether big or small, any support will be of great encouragement as I move forward towards achieving this dream of mine, and ultimately, hopefully will also create a ripple effect that will contribute to the empowerment of youth around the world and the safe guarding of this great planet and all its living beings. 
If unable to contribute financially, can I ask yout o please share my cause with others to help spread the word, and help me reach my target!?

declining at an alarming rate, which is putting pressure on both humans (in
terms of food security and the economy) and marine wildlife. The result of this
is many conflicts between fishermen and the marine mammals because of
competition for the fish.<br/></p>
<p>The conflicts particularly arise
with the bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>), the common dolphin (<i>Delphinus delphis</i>) the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal (<i>Monachus
monachus</i>) and loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>). As a consequence of the conflicts, these beautiful and
precious animals are often being hurt or killed because they are trying to take
fish from the nets.</p>
<p>The new nets we will provide the
fishermen with have a larger mesh size, which prevents the catch of small
immature fish, allowing them to grow and repopulate the surrounding area. This
results in a rise in fish stocks, which not only provides more food for the
dolphins and other wildlife, but also benefiting the catches of the fishermen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are currently placing huge
pressures on our seas, and if we wish to continue to live off them then we need
to conserve and protect all the species that live within them. One of the main
problems our oceans are currently facing is the decimation of fish stocks, and
with this project we are trying to tackle and prevent further decline.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/573578/files/20140512065857-10250285_10152055862320878_3325077456332213198_n.jpg?1399903137"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Photo above: Giving out nets after the last campaign</i><p></p><p></p><p>A small amount of money was able to make a large positive change, therefore, whatever you are able to contribute, even €1, can make a huge difference and shows lots of support. </p><p></p>

into an inevitable conflict with marine mammals, due to decreasing fish stocks and the fight
for fish to survive. The nets we are providing are more selective: have a larger mesh size,
preventing the capture of smaller fish, allowing them to reproduce, repopulating the area. With this 2nd campaign
we we wish to raise even more money so that we can reach out to a greater number of fishermen from Lipsi, Patmos and Arki islands, and especially those fishing within the Permanent Wildlife Refuge of Arki Island Complex (Patmos region). All of the fishermen involved will agree to and sign a voluntary code of conduct promising to respect marine life. 
The last campaign raised €1280 from 27
funders. With this we were able to provide 1600m of nets to 12 fishermen of
Lipsi.Photo above: Giving out nets after the last campaign 
This time we want to beat this
amount and raise at least €10,000 which we will give in the form of sustainable fishing gear to at as many fishermen as posible (with priority to those who have no income other than fishing). If everyone pulls together and donates even just a small amount, we can achieve
this target, or even exceed it, allowing us to reach out to more fishermen on more islands. Please donate as little or as much as you can, as all help and
support is extremely important to us, not only in monetary value but also as
moral support.RESULTS OF OUR LAST CAMPAIGN
Our
last campaign helped out many of the small-scale fishermen of Lipsi, and they
were all thoroughly touched by everyone’s generosity. They were especially
amazed at how even people with very little spare money still made a contribution. This made them feel like they hadn’t been forgotten and
that people care. In the past, many marine mammals were caught in the nets, damaging them, however none were injured or killed.  If you would like to find out more about what we did last time, please click this link:https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-conserve-dolphins-and-fish-stocks-on-the-small-aegean-island-of-lipsiWHY ARE THESE NETS IMPORTANT?Our fish stocks are currently
declining at an alarming rate, which is putting pressure on both humans (in
terms of food security and the economy) and marine wildlife. The result of this
is many conflicts between fishermen and the marine mammals because of
competition for the fish.
The conflicts particularly arise
with the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus
monachus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). As a consequence of the conflicts, these beautiful and
precious animals are often being hurt or killed because they are trying to take
fish from the nets.
The new nets we will provide the
fishermen with have a larger mesh size, which prevents the catch of small
immature fish, allowing them to grow and repopulate the surrounding area. This
results in a rise in fish stocks, which not only provides more food for the
dolphins and other wildlife, but also benefiting the catches of the fishermen.

We are currently placing huge
pressures on our seas, and if we wish to continue to live off them then we need
to conserve and protect all the species that live within them. One of the main
problems our oceans are currently facing is the decimation of fish stocks, and
with this project we are trying to tackle and prevent further decline.Photo above: Giving out nets after the last campaignA small amount of money was able to make a large positive change, therefore, whatever you are able to contribute, even €1, can make a huge difference and shows lots of support. 
OUR GOALSShort
term goals
·  Provide new large mesh nets to as many fishermen as possible from the area of Lipsi, Patmos, and Arki, and begin to increase fish stocks
·  Reduce conflict between marine
mammals and fishermen
·  Work with the local fishing community to develop a fisheries management plan of sustainable practices of
fishing, minimising damage to the environment
Long
term goals
·  Extend
the project and provide new large mesh nets to fishermen of other islands
·  Extend
the fisheries management plan to other islands too
·  Protect
and increase fish stocks of the Aegean to further reduce conflicts between
fishermen and marine mammals
·  Long
term monitoring of marine mammals to gather knowledge on their population sizes
and patterns

<h3>Who are we, and what are we all about? </h3>
<p>Bring Your Bag Chicago is a campaign that is leading an important and necessary environmental movement in the beautiful city of Chicago. There are three key groups of people in our movement. One is a group of activists working hard on public outreach and education; several of whom you're being introduced to today on Indiegogo. Second is another group of activists working hard on the legislative/political front. Their mission is to pass a citywide ordinance, introduced by Alderman Joe Moreno (<a href=""http://www.ward1.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ward1.org</a>) and signed by four co-sponsors, that will greatly reduce use of single-use plastic bags in Chicago and incentivize a cultural shift towards bringing reusable bags. The third, and most important part of the group, is all of YOU - people who engage, say NO to plastic bags and take action by using reusable bags themselves. All of you are a critical part of this wave of change happening in Chicago - and throughout the world - today. (A great resource for bag news throughout the world is <a href=""http://www.bagmonster.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bagmonster.com</a>. Click on ""Track the Movement"" for a list of hundreds of cities that have already passed bag legislation.) </p>

Abby also testified with us at City Hall, along with her traveling Bag Monster. </strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first hearing for Chicago's Plastic Bag Reduction Ordinance was a huge success at Chicago's City Hall on June 18th, 2013. (Watch our campaign video which was shown at City Hall here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/68606941"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/68606941</a>. Note there is an updated statistic since the creation of this video: plastic bags cost Chicago consumers over <strong>$40 million a year</strong> as opposed to the original statistic of $27 million in the video.) </p>
<p>The second hearing is anticipated as early as September of this year, at which there will be a vote on this issue in the Committee for Health and Environmental Protection. Help us build this wave of momentum and make positive change happen all the way from City Hall to the grocery store in your neighborhood to Lake Michigan and the five oceans beyond. </p>

<h3>So...where is all the money going to go?  </h3>
<p><span>$8,000 will be used to support four specific campaign goals.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><strong>An installation at Figment</strong>, an arts festival coming to Chicago the weekend of August 10th and 11th in Garfield Park, Chicago                                </span>             </li>
<li><span>Launching a <strong>paid social media campaign</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community outreach events</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>“Seed” money</strong> to fund an initial <strong>small line of products</strong> we will sell online and/or at local stores in Chicago</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Please read below for complete details about all four.  </span></p>
<p> 1. <strong>FIGMENT</strong>. Our first big event to engage and educate the public will be setting up an art installation at arts festival Figment. We will have a pop-up (a tent-like structure propped up by four posts) surrounded by a plastic bag canopy containing <strong>2,568 bags - the amount of plastic bags used EVERY MINUTE of EVERY DAY in Chicago. </strong>That's insane, isn't it? </p>
<p>Strings of plastic bags will be threaded and tied together and secured to the ground by tent stakes. To show support, you can sign one of these 2,568 bags, and at our next hearing one of our activists (Rohan Thadani) will testify with this giant pile of plastic before City Council, creating a powerful visual testimony. We will also be giving away 800 reusable, 100% cotton, WASHABLE tote bags at the installation totally FREE. People will be able to screen print their own bags with our campaign logo, sign our Change.org petition, and sign a postcard we will hand-deliver to Rahm Emanuel. Lots of cool stuff going on. The funding we need for Figment is as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>800 cotton tote bags: $800</span></li>
<li><span>Pop-up: $100</span></li>
<li><span>Two tables and four chairs: $100</span></li>
<li><span>Screen printing supplies: $150</span></li>
<li><span>Twine and tent stakes: $50</span></li>
<li><span>1,000 postcards: $50</span></li>
<li><span>Candy and fruit to seduce people into our installation: $50</span></li>
</ul>
<p> TOTAL FUNDING NEEDED FOR FIGMENT: $1300</p>

<p><span><em><strong> </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span>2. <strong>PAID SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN</strong>. To promote our first hearing which happened June 18th, our campaign experimented with a few Facebook advertisements and promoted posts to reach a wider audience. The cost of these promotions was small ($15-$25), and the amount of traffic and engagement generated on our site was huge. Marketing is a vital component to any successful campaign; it played a key role in the lead up to our successful hearing. We will use this advertising budget to promote Figment, promote our community events, promote our Change.org petition, promote our hearing, generate calls to aldermen preceding the hearing as well as advertise our cool campaign swag that people can purchase. We have budgeted $2000 for advertising and marketing so that we can get the word out about all the stuff we’re doing and get people engaged! </span></p>
<p> TOTAL FUNDING NEEDED FOR PAID SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN: $1500</p>
<p>      <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kathleendeggelman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/social-media-companies.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong style=""font-style: italic;"">Facebook and Twitter are more than ways to waste your life away trolling newsfeeds. They can also be used to make the world a better place: being extremely effective at reaching people and cost efficient, social media is especially useful for social and environmental activism campaigns. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>3. <strong>COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS</strong>. Rahm needs to hear from the people of Chicago, and letter writing is a great way to let him know what we want. We will host at least FOUR letter-writing parties where people can create their own letters or sign our postcards. We will personally deliver these letters and post cards to Rahm’s office at City Hall. Two of these parties will be at bars (21+) we are partnering with in Chicago, and two of these parties will be at family-friendly establishments (exact locations are to be determined). We have budgeted $200 for each of these letter-writing parties, where everyone will get a reusable, screen printed cotton tote AND a drink, ice cream cone or other small token of our appreciation on us. We have also budgeted $200 for 4,000 postcards (a total of $1000 budgeted for letter-writing events).</p>
<p>We will also be giving away FREE REUSABLE BAGS in various locations throughout Chicago, particularly in neighborhoods where constituents may feel that they cannot afford to purchase a reusable bag. We will host as least FOUR reusable bag giveaways, where we will set up a table with information about our campaign. Everyone who signs our Change.org petition will receive a free reusable cotton tote printed with our campaign logo. We have budgeted $1600 for reusable cotton totes to give away at these events (this will buy us 1600 cotton tote bags). </p>
<p><span>TOTAL FUNDING NEEDED FOR COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS: $2600 </span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shft.com/thumbs/540x308/files/plastic-state-1-8787.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Community outreach is a critical part of any campaign. People need to know about the issue and be inspired to do something about it. Above is a shot from the YouTube video, 'Plastic State of Mind.' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koETnR0NgLY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koETnR0NgLY</a></strong></em><br/></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>4. <strong>“SEED” MONEY FOR CAMPAIGN SWAG WE CAN SELL FOR A SMALL PROFIT</strong>. We expect a second successful hearing in Chicago, but after the legislation is passed the work of raising awareness, educating the public and helping to facilitate a smooth transition from disposables to reusables only ramps up. Legislation has to be accompanied by public education to work.</p>
<p>So we thought it would be a great idea if we could come up with a few products to sell that would advertise for us AND generate a small profit that could be rolled into more funding. This will assure that we will be able to provide more free bag giveaways and advertising going forward. </p>
<p>We are joining forces with ChicoBag, a reusable bag company, to provide our campaign with an initial 250 rip-stop nylon bags printed with our campaign logo. These bags fold up into a tiny sack that can be clipped right onto your keychain or bag and slipped into any purse or briefcase. We can get these bags for approximately five dollars each. We will be selling these online as well as taking them to a few local retailers to see if they would be interested in carrying our product (all the proceeds would go to our campaign). The other things that we will be selling are t-shirts, v-neck t-shirts, and tank tops with our campaign logo. The cost of 250 ChicoBags is approximately $1250, and we are budgeting $750 for our small line of clothing which includes the cost of prizes for donating to our campaign. </p>
<p>This $2000 that we are investing in campaign swag serves an important purpose. If we can self-sustain, we can provide THOUSANDS of free bags to people who need them, continue to grow our influence, and ensure Chicago becomes a leader in this worldwide movement! </p>
<p><span>TOTAL “SEED” MONEY FUNDING NEEDED: $2000</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.buygreen.com/ProductImages/CHBG00001_dt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><span><em><strong>Bring Your Bag Chicago is partnering with ChicoBag and other companies to produce a small line of products. </strong></em><br/></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The grand total of our budget is $7400. If we do raise the full amount - $8,000 - that we are hoping to, our net fundraising total after site fees will be $7440. That will give us an extra $40 to buy unexpected things we may not have budgeted for...like, extra cherries, gummi sharks, and bug spray for our fabulous volunteers. </span></p>

So we thought it would be a great idea if we could come up with a few products to sell that would advertise for us AND generate a small profit that could be rolled into more funding. This will assure that we will be able to provide more free bag giveaways and advertising going forward. 
We are joining forces with ChicoBag, a reusable bag company, to provide our campaign with an initial 250 rip-stop nylon bags printed with our campaign logo. These bags fold up into a tiny sack that can be clipped right onto your keychain or bag and slipped into any purse or briefcase. We can get these bags for approximately five dollars each. We will be selling these online as well as taking them to a few local retailers to see if they would be interested in carrying our product (all the proceeds would go to our campaign). The other things that we will be selling are t-shirts, v-neck t-shirts, and tank tops with our campaign logo. The cost of 250 ChicoBags is approximately $1250, and we are budgeting $750 for our small line of clothing which includes the cost of prizes for donating to our campaign. 
This $2000 that we are investing in campaign swag serves an important purpose. If we can self-sustain, we can provide THOUSANDS of free bags to people who need them, continue to grow our influence, and ensure Chicago becomes a leader in this worldwide movement! 
TOTAL “SEED” MONEY FUNDING NEEDED: $2000
 
Bring Your Bag Chicago is partnering with ChicoBag and other companies to produce a small line of products. 
 
The grand total of our budget is $7400. If we do raise the full amount - $8,000 - that we are hoping to, our net fundraising total after site fees will be $7440. That will give us an extra $40 to buy unexpected things we may not have budgeted for...like, extra cherries, gummi sharks, and bug spray for our fabulous volunteers. 
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, and we understand that. But that doesn’t mean they can’t still help us out! Here are five great ways to still help us out: 

""Like"" us on Facebook, share our page with your friends, and sign our petition at www.change.org/petitions/bring-your-bag-chicago.
Share our Indiegogo with anyone who you think might support us.
VOLUNTEER with us! We are constantly looking for people to help us out, even if it's just for a couple hours. Send us a private message through our Facebook page to find out about different opportunities. 
Come to our next hearing, which may be as soon as September, at Chicago City Hall. Even sign up to testify if you'd like! 
Finally, BRING YOUR OWN BAG! Whenever you leave your house, you are an advertisement for your lifestyle. When you go shopping, everyone around you will see you use your reusable bag and you never know who it might inspire. 

 
“Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”
― Robert F. Kennedy

 
Bring Your Bag Chicago would like to extend a huge thank you and amazing karma to everyone who has helped to create this campaign for over a year and a half, and all of the supporters who helped it really get off the ground this spring.

Appreciation to Supporters of the Fukushima
Idiegogo Campaign</b></p>
<p></p><p>Dear Friends:</p>
<p>The Idiegogo Campaign is coming to a close on January 6,
2014. We wish to thank all those who have visited the Campaign site for your
concern, interest, and support. Although the Campaign did not realize its
financial targets, we did make progress on several important fronts. Here is a
Summary Progress Report and our Action Plan for moving forward.</p>
<p><b>Progress Report</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Fukushima presents
     an array of formidable challenges to the world. The first circle contains
     technical challenges, particularly relating to Reactors 1-4. It is
     extraordinary that the removal of fuel assemblies in Reactor 4 has thus
     far proceeded apparently without mishap. TEPCO and the Japanese government
     deserve credit for this. But we are only at the threshold of this perilous
     operation. The greatest risk is a M 6+ earthquake, which could topple the
     spent fuel pool in Reactor 4 or precipitate a criticality in the remaining
     three. We continue to believe that the Japanese government is dangerously
     underestimating the consequences of such an earthquake by not
     collaborating closely with the international community in preparing a
     Global Emergency Contingency Plan. Our affiliated seismologists continue
     to believe that the probability of a M 6 + earthquake originating either
     in Japan
     or within the Ring of Fire with serious consequences on Reactors 1-4 is
     extremely high and will occur sometime in 2014.</li>
<li>
<b>Comprehensive Monitoring</b>--One of
     the startling realizations produced by the Campaign is that the west coast
     states are not conducting comprehensive monitoring of radiation levels. We
     have sent a letter to Governor Jerry Brown requesting a meeting and urging
     him to install such a system which is described in the write up in the
     Campaign and our last blog. Accurate monitoring is in everyone’s interest.
     If radiation levels are below regulatory standards, Governor Brown and the
     public can have peace of mind. If the levels exceed regulatory standards
     or are recognized to be dangerous at even lower levels (This is quite
     possible as a regulatory standard is not a guarantee of safety, merely a
     political compromise), at the least the Governor will be forewarned and in
     a position to undertake preemptive action. As of this writing Governor Brown
     has not responded to our request for a meeting.</li>
<li>
<b>Potential Breakthroughs</b>—The Explorers’
     Wheel 1.0 we will build is a powerful software program coupled to an imaginative
     web site. Although the Explorers’ Wheel has not received adequate financial
     support, notwithstanding, the Idiegogo Campaign has succeeded in raising
     public consciousness and has identified a number of promising potential
     solutions that we will continue to vet and to offer to the engineers on
     the front lines of Fukushima.
     Some of these potential breakthroughs are described in other parts of the
     Campaign. They include:</li>
<li>An
     innovative entombment strategy proposed by a triple Ph.D. emeritus
     professor of ocean engineering at MIT.</li>
<li>Several
     technologies that will seal the containers currently storing the
     radioactive waste water.</li>
<li>A radically
     different radiation containment strategy. We are currently vetting the
     product(s) and contracting for a series of independent tests of the
     extraordinary claims of the inventor. We will continue to provide reports
     of our progress on our web site.</li>
<li>
<b>Medical Challenges</b>—Fukushima presents
     medical challenges involving radiation exposure and illness that the
     international medical community is only beginning to address. At the same
     time there are increasing numbers of cases, especially of thyroid cancer
     in young children in Japan;
     a medical record is being built in the litigation initiated by American
     service men and women on the US Ronald Reagan who were exposed to
     radiation in their rescue attempt during the original March 2011
     explosion. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1K3qzBqjOc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1K3qzBqjOc</a>
</li>
<li>Fukushima
     presents a stark challenge of how to address, treat, and if possible
     prevent a whole range of illnesses (including infectious diseases
     resulting from compromised immune systems) related to greatly increased
     levels of exposure to radiation among unprecedentedly large populations.
     As of this writing the Japanese government has not been forthcoming in
     cooperating with the international medical community. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&amp;feature=em-upload_owner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&amp;feature=em-upload_owner</a>
</li>
<li>
<b>Political Developments</b>—The tragedy
     of Fukushima continues to unfold against
     the background of poorly conceived national policies both in Japan and the U.S. The clearest example is Japan’s State
     Secrets Protection Law enacted in December 2013. The new law can be
     interpreted to criminalize the release by physicians of vital medical data,
     deemed to be “state secrets,” relating to radiation illnesses of their
     patients. The enactment of the State Secrets Law undermines almost seventy
     years of democratic institutions in Japan. Most troubling is the
     connection of the State Secrets Law with a series of policies being
     implemented by the Obama Administration without Congressional oversight
     hearings, predicated on the premise that a rearmed (even nuclear Japan) is the best deterrent against an
     increasingly hostile China.
     The situation presents an extraordinary opportunity for courageous and
     imaginative members of both the Japanese Diet and U.S. Congress to
     collaborate in holding joint hearings. This would be a historic event. It
     will attract broad media coverage, develop a joint record, and help to
     inform both legislative branches of government and the public. The
     Fukushima Explorers’ Wheel will be a powerful means to educate, engage,
     and empower the public in connection with these proceedings. </li>
</ul><p><b>Explorers Wheel 1.0
Your Personal Roadmap to Health, Longevity &amp; Abundance</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The
     same platform that will support the Fukushima Explorers’ Wheel will also
     launch other Explorers’ Wheels for humanity. Because Fukushima presents unprecedented risks
     to human health and well being, an Explorer’s Wheel focusing on Your
     Personal Roadmap to Health, Longevity &amp; Abundance is the logical next
     step. We have a detailed Development Plan in place and our Technical Team is
     ready to implement. Again the missing ingredient is financing. The
     Fukushima Explorers Wheel has inspired and will be closely linked to the
     Health, Longevity &amp; Abundance Wheel.</li>
<li>Here
     is the Mission Statement from the Executive Summary—“Our mission is to
     create an entertaining and affordable multiplatform app that will enable millions
     of “explorers” in every country of the world to create their own personal
     roadmap(s) to enhanced health, longevity, and a more abundant life. The
     Explorers Wheel 1.0 will introduce the best available health-related science
     and technology of the West deepened by the wisdom and experience of mind,
     body, and spirit of Eastern and indigenous healing traditions. The Wheel
     will spin and gain momentum by the stories of thousands and thousands of
     explorers, for storytelling is how our minds create, process, and
     transform reality. The Explorers’ Wheel 1.0 will not dispense any form of
     medical or other advice. Rather, it will simply support explorers on their
     own personal journeys into health, longevity, and abundance.”</li>
<li>The
     Health, Longevity &amp; Abundance Wheel will be the subject of a case
     study in a massive open online course (MOOC) we will offer in
     collaboration with Case Western Reserve University in the spring of 2014
     on the theme of “Innovation Integration for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.”</li>
</ul><p><b>Next Steps—</b>Althoughthe
Idiegogo Campaign is ending, our Campaign to bring sanity, compassion, balance,
and intelligence to the challenges of Fukushima
is just beginning. Alliances for Discovery will renew its investment in time
and energy to uncover scientific and technical breakthroughs, while launching
the first of a series of Explorers Wheels that in time will evolve into a
“Global Brain for Humanity.” During the next three months we will be carefully
and critically testing and vetting the
technology of one of our collaborating scientists who may-- just may-- have a
turnkey solution to the horrors of Fukushima. We will continue to keep you
informed through regular blogs and Innovation “Alerts.”  In the meantime, we express our continuing deep
appreciation for your interest and support, and wish you….. </p>
<p>A Bountiful, Happy, and Healthy 2014.</p>

Crises by Automating Crowd Intelligence</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Dear
Friends, </span><br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to create a phenomenal resource that doesn’t exist today: a Global Brain for Humanity. (Explorers’ Wheel). The Explorer’s Wheel
is a unique software program that mines the intersections among fields, often
the most fertile area of discovery and invention. The software is designed to
support effective collaboration between experts and “creative amateurs” which
is the key to solving many seemingly impossible global problems. Our Team of
Explorers (See Gallery) has been working on the components for over ten years.
We are now ready to bring them together in a coherent system. We propose to
apply this first Explorers’ Wheel to the unfolding nuclear crisis at Fukushima, Japan,
already the most serious nuclear disaster in history. (<a href=""http://www.explorerswheel.com/blog/inventing-humanitya-collaborative-strategy-global-survival"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.explorerswheel.com/blog/inventing-humanitya-collaborative-strategy-global-survival</a>)
</p>
<p><b>Fukushima’s
Cry for Help </b></p>
<p>Ambassador Mitsuhei Murata has issued this eloquent and
poignant appeal to the world: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn0bXqT1Yhw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn0bXqT1Yhw</a></p>
<p>Here is the essence of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The operator Tokyo Electric Power
     Company (TEPCO) has lost control of the situation.</li>
<li>300-400 tons of Tritium, Cesium
     134/137, and Strontium 90 are being discharged into the Pacific
      Ocean each day. This has been going on continuously since the
     accident in March 2011.</li>
<li>TEPCO has begun attempting to remove
     by hand over 1000 hot fuel assemblies, each ½ ton, located in an already
     damaged spent fuel pool 100 ft above the ground. If there is an accident
     the pool can catch fire, the rods can combust, or worst of all, two or more
     of the assemblies could touch and produce a fissionable reaction,
     releasing radioactive contamination into the atmosphere.</li>
<li>The chances of this happening will
     increase dramatically if there is another M 7 earthquake. The pool is
     likely secured to a level M 6 earthquake. There is a high probability of a
     M 6+ earthquake within the next 12 months.</li>
<li>A radioactive plume is heading across
     the Pacific and is anticipated to arrive on the west coast of the U.S. and Hawaii sometime in 2014. The health
     effects at this point are indeterminate. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&amp;feature=em-upload_owner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&amp;feature=em-upload_owner</a>
</li>
</ul>

Similar conditions exist at other nuclear power plants
in the U.S. such as Diablo Canyon. Diablo Canyon is poised to become a second Fukushima. The plant is not well fortified against a mega-earthquake (M9+)/tsunami as has occurred at Fukushima. The US Geological Survey expects such an earthquake in Alaska or possibly around the Cascadia fault. .(<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone</b></a>). No emergency management plan is in place to protect the citizens of California.<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">NEW!!(12/12/13) Innovation Action Alert # 1--Reliable
Radiation Monitoring for California
and other western states</b><br/></p><p>
</p><p>An Explorers’ Wheel among its many
uses is a powerful tool to invite, aggregate, and focus crowd intelligence on
solving critical global problems. Fukushima is presenting a critical challenge right here in California for which we have already devised
a solution: <b>Comprehensive and reliable monitoring coupled to an innovative
program of public education.</b> </p>
<p><b>The Challenge</b>: There are
increasing numbers of reports of serious radioactive contamination arriving on the
west coast of the U.S. from Fukushima. Are reports
like these accurate or exaggerated?</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/72-mjt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/72-mjt</a></p>
<p>We believe that Governor Jerry Brown has an urgent public duty
to obtain accurate information about the current and emerging situation and to
inform the relevant state agencies and the general public. If based on
comprehensive, continuous, and accurate monitoring, Governor Brown and his
professional team<b>, along with a team of independent
experts and observers,</b> determine that the radioactive contamination is not
a problem, Governor Brown will have done the people of California a great service by allaying fears
and misunderstanding and restoring public trust in government. He will have established a baseline framework and methodology for other U.S. states, indeed nations,
beginning with Japan. On the other hand, if monitoring determines that there is
a serious problem, the State of California
will be in an excellent position to mount an effective Emergency Response Plan.</p>
<p><b>An Immediately Available
System</b></p>
<p>We
urge Governor Brown immediately to install a comprehensive program of state
wide radiation monitoring. At present this program does not exist. All the key
elements are available from pioneering companies like International Medcom. A
comprehensive program would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Cloud-based Real time
     Monitoring System with Public Access to Data (airborne
     radiation). One sensor detects gamma radiation only and outputs data
     in mR/hr or uSv/hr. The other sensor detects beta and gamma and outputs
     data in CPM.  Each station is also equipped with meteorological
     sensors, a data logger, and an ethernet interface to bring data to a
     central data collection point and to a public website, where data is
     displayed as color coded icons on a map of the state.  Color  of the icons will change with
     radiation levels, with interpretive data accessible through the User
     Interface on the website.</li>
<li>Hand Held Instruments for
     Marine Debris Monitoring-- These are special geiger counters with good
     sensitivity to alpha and beta radiation.  The primary purpose of
     these instruments is to assure the public that radioactive debris from Fukushima is removed
     properly from public beaches and detected.  A secondary purpose is to
     monitor seaweed and marine life for gross contamination.  </li>
<li>Mobile Public Screening and
     Educational Laboratory-- These mobile units will test samples of fish,
     shell fish, seaweed, starfish, marine mammals and other biological media.
     It will serve as a smart educational exchange to reassure the public that
     the State of California
     is vigilant on this issue.</li>
<li>Testing &amp; Analysis
     Laboratory-- The proposed mobile lab will test ocean water for Tritium,
     Cesium 134, Cesium 137 and Strontium 90, the predominant radio-nuclides
     from Fukushima. The lab will also test samples of fish, shell fish,
     seaweed, starfish, marine mammals and other biological media.</li>
</ul><p>Collaborative
Innovation Enabled by an Explorers’ Wheel</p>
<p>If
reports such as the above turn out to be accurate, there will be sudden and
urgent need for innovations that improve the above system. This challenge is an
ideal candidate for a frontier educational initiative organized as
public/private partnership between the State of California and private companies. The goal
would be to tap the imaginative talent of Silicon Valley
and other innovation hubs, integrating frontier technologies of social media,
crowd intelligence, advanced search, smart publishing, 3-D printing, 3-D
visualization, and other relevant platforms. Such a program will go a long way
to reducing fear and misunderstanding about nuclear energy in general, while
building public trust in the Governor Brown’s commitment to protecting the
public.</p>
<p></p><p><b>Inventive Challenges at the Fukushima Site—</b>Fukushima already presents the world with a host of inventive challenges which the experts in Japan will not be able to solve by themselves or by conferring with other experts in their vertical silos of specialty. A creative bridge must be built between the engineers at ground zero and an inspired and informed public. This is where “swarm creativity”* or ""crowd intelligence"" becomes most useful. <b>The Explorers’ Wheel begins to spin with your and the domain experts' questions.</b> Here are some of the most urgent:</p><ul>
<li>How to remove over 1000 fuel assemblies in Reactors 3 &amp; 4 safely?</li>
<li>How to keep the fuel assemblies cool if there is an accident and the pool starts to leak or collapse?</li>
<li>How to divert the stream running under the plants which will help to control the discharges into the ocean?</li>
<li>How to predict the next M6+ earthquake with a lead time of at least one month in order to secure and fortify the spent fuel pools?</li>
<li>How to install widespread monitoring of all radioactive substances, including tritium, Cesium 134/137, Strontium 90, and “hot” nano-particles of plutonium?</li>
<li>How to implement effective and transparent monitoring in a way that inspires and restores public trust in government?</li>
<li>How to develop public health and medical diagnostic and treatment protocols to cope with widespread radiation illnesses?</li>
<li>How to mount an effective global emergency response if and when necessary?</li>
</ul><p><b>Some
Early Innovative Breakthroughs</b></p><p></p>
<p>Entombment</p>
<p>We
are already gathering and analyzing the most promising innovations. For example,
a triple Ph.D. professor emeritus in ocean engineering from MIT has proposed
entombing Reactors 3 &amp; 4 with a form of liquid concrete that is lighter
than water. The concrete would be dissolved in water and only harden after it
is sprayed on the Reactors. It could be sprayed on the pools from above through
a telescopic nozzle suspended from helicopters. Since the pools are already
being cooled with water, the controlled delivery of additional water should not
in theory further destabilize the pools. We are seeking to obtain design
drawings of Reactors 3 &amp; 4 in order to determine whether entombment can be
accomplished safely. If the liquid concrete can be delivered to penetrate the
entire facility, we may have a way to prevent the further release of radiation
into both air and ocean.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>The Japanese government has thus far received over 800 proposed
solutions from around the world. The Idiegogo Campaign is currently analyzing
some of the most promising of these, including novel ways to seal the containers holding radioactive water. This underlies the importance of
developing a mechanism—an imaginative way to automate the process—which can
rapidly analyze, match, enhance, prioritize, and deliver the most promising
breakthroughs to the key decision makers. This is one of several essential functions of an
Explorers’ Wheel.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Innovation Alert # 2-- The Ultimate Fukushima Challenge</b></p><p></p>
<p>Can we discover a way to neutralize radiation at Fukushima so that Reactors 1-4 can be rendered non-toxic
and safe, and similarly render neutral and harmless other areas contaminated by
emissions from Fukushima including the Pacific Ocean? This could potentially be a Holy Grail Solution
not only for the Japanese authorities struggling with Fukushima but for the rest of the world
wrestling with how to treat and manage radioactive waste. It is an ideal challenge
for a new approach to harvest crowd intelligence for humanity— a Global
Explorers Mind.</p><p>
Step # 1—Define the “Core Discovery Puzzle” (CDP) As described in <i>Piloting Through Chaos—The Explorer’s Mind</i>
the first step in the process is to define the “Core Discovery Puzzle(CDP)” in
the language of the domain experts themselves, in this case nuclear engineers.
Here is a simplified explanation:</p>
<p>Radiation is produced by releases of energy from the nucleus
of certain elements such as Tritium, Cesium, Strontium, Uranium, Plutonium,
Xenon, and other elements. This radiation is highly destructive to living cells
because it damages DNA, induces mutations, generates free radicals, and other
harmful effects. Hence the CDP is how to stabilize the nucleus. In other words,
can we discover a way to render the nucleus either completely inert, or to
block or to significantly retard (or dramatically increase) the process of
decay, so that the nucleus becomes stable? Under these conditions the above
elements will remain in a “pure” non-isotopic state. Some experiments have
shown that bombarding these isotopic elements with gamma radiation can actually reduce the radiation. However, this method is not practical or cost effective
for Fukushima,
at least at the moment. Is it possible to devise a practical method which can
be applied immediately and cost effectively?</p>

</ul><p>Step # 2—“Democratizing the CDP”—A Challenge to the Idiegogo
Campaign</p>
<p>The history of science is replete with the contributions of
“creative amateurs” who without advanced degrees conceived breakthroughs of
enormous significance for humanity. Pasteur was not a physician but a
biochemist; Albert Einstein worked as a clerk in a patent office; many
breakthroughs in astronomy are attributed to unheralded imaginative amateurs.
The key is to create a <b>communication
bridge--</b> a special language built on imagery, metaphor, and stories—
between Sponsors or Seekers and Solution Providers. How many brilliant minds
might be motivated to devise practical solutions for Fukushima if we can level the playing field
by: 1. translating the complex issues into terms that anyone can readily understand
2. packaging the creative responses so they can be rapidly grasped and 3.
priming the problem holders on the front lines at Fukushima to be open to fresh ideas and
different perspectives?</p>
<p>The Challenge: Can you help us depict the above CDP by an
analogy, image, picture, story, or metaphor that is so clear and simple that
any bright eight-year old will understand it? </p>
<p>Hint # 1: The nucleus will naturally degrade on its own. It
“seeks” a lower energy state under the laws of thermodynamics, which is why it
is throws off particles or waves of energy. We can influence it with a physical
event from the outside—ie. bombarding it with gamma rays. But can you think of
any process or example where something regains an “internal harmony” without
outside interference? It no longer “needs” to look outward to add or subtract
anything? It simply “discovers” or “attains” its own internal balance, harmony,
and stability. Nature and the world’s wisdom traditions may afford some clues,
and there may also be “lead users” in even remote industrial applications. (See
the work of Professor Eric Von Hippel of MIT’s Sloane School)</p>
<p>Crowd Intelligence—We welcome your ideas and input. An
Explorers’ Wheel begins to spin and to gain momentum with the inquiry around
the CDP. Even if you believe your “solution(s)” are farfetched, please don’t
censor yourself. It may turn out that your “lead” will inspire a fellow
explorer, and by “chance” a breakthrough will emerge. Remember the origin of
the word “discover” is the Latin “discoupire” ie. to “uncover.” The breakthrough
may exist already somewhere in the crowd. It is just a matter of giving it a
voice. Chance favors the prepared mind.</p>

<p></p><p>The image on the left is the basic template for an
Explorer’s Wheel which was designed to support a personal discovery process.
Depicted in the center are 8 realms. The image on the right shows how each of
these realms can be expressed in words or pictures. Here is how a similar
template can be usefully applied in addressing one of the world’s most complex
and urgent calamities: the continuing nuclear disaster at Fukushima.</p>
<p>Step 1: Adapting the Wheel—The basic template can be
customized to your areas of greatest interest and concern. For example, the
following 8 realms might encompass Fukushima and similar disasters:
“Solutions,” “Medical,” “Aid to Victims,” “Monitoring,” “Emergency Management,”
“Advocacy,” “Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and Other Causes,” and “Guidance” (Wise
Decision Making).</p>
<p>Step 2: Inputting Your Data—Simply click the spiral and
input your core question or desired area of exploration. You can then begin to
input your other important ideas, themes, pictures, or stories into any of the
8 realms. Each realm can transform into its own 8-realm template, as
illustrated above.</p>
<p>Step 3: A Collective Discovery Engine—The Explorer’s Wheel
is a continuously evolving, intelligent, and transforming Discovery Engine. It
records, analyzes, synthesizes, and aggregates your contributions and those of
every other explorer. It is “smart”-- it continuously learns 24/7 from you and
everyone else in the Network. The more its members contribute, the faster the
Wheel learns and works on developing solutions to the problem(s). </p>
<p>Step 4: Accessing Discoveries—The Explorer’s Wheel is
available to you anywhere, anytime. It will be designed to run on any major
platform and on any device. All you need to do is click into the Network. The
Explorers’ Wheel becomes your personal learning portal.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Technology
Development Note</b></p>
<p>The Explorers' World Platform will be supported by five (5) online
engines:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Explorers' Mind Engine</b>: To help
     explorers develop powerful tools and skills to support them on their
     journey.</li>
<li>
<b>The Explorers' Wheel Engine</b>: To provide
     a coherent framework to enable explorers to discover new and surprising
     connections between diverse fields and domains of knowledge. </li>
<li>
<b>The Explorers' World Transformation</b>
<b>Engine</b>: To create a
     “translation engine” which will express and translate complex and
     technical fields of expertise into images, metaphors, pictures, and
     stories that people everywhere can easily grasp; and by this
     Transformation Engine establish a unique <b>communications bridge</b> between domain experts and creative
     amateurs.</li>
<li>
<b>The Explorers' Circle Accelerator</b> <b>Engine</b>: To develop a living
     intelligent platform—a global brain-- that learns about each explorer 24/7
     and can provide instant and useful feedback and guidance for wide range of
     activities, including project management.</li>
<li>
<b>The Explorers' Customer &amp;
     Marketplace</b> <b>Engine</b>: To create
     non-profit humanitarian applications which will monetize the psychographic
     data bases, archives, libraries, tools, and collaborative intellectual
     property contributed by explorers throughout the networks.</li>
</ul><p>Many of the core elements listed above have already been
conceived and tested, and in some instances, already developed in earlier
ventures by the Core Team. Our most important technical challenge will be how
to integrate these diverse elements into a “global brain” that will include
some of the most interesting features and skill sets of social media, crowd
sourcing, advanced search, smart technologies, narrative platforms, and gaming.
We have identified some talented software programmers who will become an
integral part of our Core Team.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Why is the Explorers’ Wheel Unique?</b></p>
<p>The Explorers’ Wheel will build upon and extend the present
capabilities of popular social media and crowd sourcing platforms such as Quora
(<a href=""http://www.quora.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.quora.com</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>It
     will enable explorers to discover the “gold” at the intersection of
     conventional disciplines, which is often the most fertile area for
     discovery and invention. (See <i>Piloting
     Through Chaos—The Explorer’s Mind</i> (<a href=""http://www.explorerswheel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.explorerswheel.com</a>)</li>
<li>The
     Explorers’ Wheel contains a wisdom algorithm to help explorers make wiser
     decisions.</li>
<li>The
     platform is “smart,” meaning it learns along with each explorer and will
     provide continuous personalized feedback based on what it learns from the
     network.</li>
<li>The
     Explorers’ Wheel will include a “Discovery Engine” which will make
     available the best techniques of discovery and invention engineering and
     collaborative innovation. </li>
<li>The
     Explorers"" Wheel will build a bridge that will help experts and creative
     amateurs communicate more effectively in solving global challenges. In
     other words, it contains an algorithm to “translate” complex scientific
     and technical questions into simple images, metaphors, and pictures so
     even a child can understand them; and then it will translate back the
     imaginative insights of non-experts so that professionals can appreciate
     and act on them.</li>
<li>The
     Explorers’ Wheel includes an advanced and proven system of artful
     negotiation which enables users to transform their dreams into practical
     and measurable results.</li>
<li>The
     Explorers' Wheel is designed to expand the “market share” of kindness,
     empathy, and generosity in the world, imperceptibly and without preaching about it.</li>
</ul><p><b>Thank
You for Your Support!</b></p>
<p>Your support will help us address the critical issues at Fukushima and also
improve the Explorer's Wheel, so that we can apply it in the future, with increasing
confidence, to clusters of other serious challenges. As noted, our longer term
goal is to create a 'living global brain' - a vast self-organizing network and expert
system reflecting our collective intelligence and wisdom. This 'collective
mind' will help us to anticipate and avoid crises, to solve problems better and
faster, and to take advantage of promising opportunities. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To do this successfully will require bringing together many
people with specific knowledge and wisdom. We invite you to join with us in
contributing to this vision and in spreading the word to your friends,
family and colleagues.  Please let them know that all of us together can
help to solve the Fukushima
challenge successfully - and that doing this together will put us in a far
better position to move forward consciously and to create other worthwhile
projects that can dramatically shape our future and the world we live in.</p>
<p><b>Rewards—</b>Idiegogo
permits us to offer Rewards for your help to us.In addition to the listed
Rewards our friends are joining us by contributing bonus awards. Here is a
first extra reward. It is a print of the Goddess Protector of the Oceans
created by our friend and partner Mayumi Oda, a famous artist and
environmentalist. We will email you this print along with other Rewards
conceived and contributed by members as the Campaign gains momentum. Mayumi
informs us there is only a few of these prints left. It is included as a bonus
to the $ 300 Reward.</p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>Our Partners—</b>Because this Campaign involves complex and serious issues
of great political, legal, and international significance, far beyond the
capacities of a single individual, or even our small and determined team, we
are joining forces with powerful environmental and other activist organizations
which have a demonstrated track record of commitment and successful advocacy on
the nuclear issues. Our initial proposed partners are: Friends of the Earth (<a href=""http://www.foe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.foe.org/</a>) and the Surfriders
Foundation (<a href=""http://www.surfrider.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.surfrider.org/</a>).
We are actively inviting other professional organizations to join the Campaign. </p><p><b>The Campaign</b></p>
<p>We
are already generating considerable momentum from these activities and other
planned events:</p>
<p>·  The concerns of thousands of global citizens who are presenting petitions to the UN drawing upon our advice and
support.</p>
<p>· A conference held on October 24 and
sponsored by the UN Association of Santa Barbara and that produced a Protocol
expressing a Call to Action on Fukushima See:<a href=""http://www.explorerswheel.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>www.explorerswheel.com/blog</b></a></p>
<p>· A team in Japan which has direct access to
the key decision makers in the Japanese government. This will ensure a hearing
on ideas generated by the Explorers’ Wheel.</p>
<p>· A massive open online course (MOOC) on
“Accelerating Breakthroughs for Fukushima
and the Coming Global Emergency Response.” It is actively being planned with
Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and will be launched early in 2014.</p>
<p>· An Innovation Summit
being planned in Tokyo
for the spring of 2014.</p>
<p>· A massive campaign contemplated by
Friends of the Earth, applying the lessons of Fukushima and the new skills of
cyber-advocacy as introduced in the Explorers Wheel, demanding appropriate
safeguards as <b>precondition</b> for
re-licensing of Diablo Canyon, including accurate monitoring of radiation
levels.</p>
<p>· A movement of millions of women in Japan
and around the world who are uniting to protest the hazards of radiation to
themselves and their children. The Fukushima/Other Disasters Explorers’ Wheel will especially
honor the contributions and sacrifices of these women explorers and advocates.</p>
<h3>Project Budget</h3>
<p>The
total budget for the project is $ 350,000 which covers the costs of software
development, consultants on emergency management, story telling, and Japan. It will
also pay for equipment, communications, marketing, licenses, administration,
and travel. We can deliver the complete Fukushima/Diablo Explorers’ Wheel
within six (6) months.</p>
<p>We
are prepared to deliver the Explorers’ Wheel <b>in
stages </b>if for some reason we
cannot raise the full amount immediately:</p>
<p>· $ 50,000 will enable us to get started,
to build a collaborative cyber-advocacy web site equipped with advanced search
capability, advocacy training materials, and some smart features.</p>
<p>· $ 100,000 will enable us to build a
basic smart interactive Explorers’ Wheel web site, with some advanced
collaborative and search capabilities linked to Explorer’s Wheel and the MOOC
on Accelerating Breakthroughs for Fukushima and the Global Emergency Response.</p>
<p>· $ 200,000 will enable us to enhance
the platform with story telling tools, and introduce a Discovery Engine of best
techniques of creative problem solving, discovery/invention engineering, and
collaborative innovation.</p>
<p>· $ 350,000 will enable us to complete the first full embodiment of the Explorer's Wheel.</p>

<p></p></div>","Closing Note of
Appreciation to Supporters of the Fukushima
Idiegogo Campaign
Dear Friends:
The Idiegogo Campaign is coming to a close on January 6,
2014. We wish to thank all those who have visited the Campaign site for your
concern, interest, and support. Although the Campaign did not realize its
financial targets, we did make progress on several important fronts. Here is a
Summary Progress Report and our Action Plan for moving forward.
Progress Report

Fukushima presents
     an array of formidable challenges to the world. The first circle contains
     technical challenges, particularly relating to Reactors 1-4. It is
     extraordinary that the removal of fuel assemblies in Reactor 4 has thus
     far proceeded apparently without mishap. TEPCO and the Japanese government
     deserve credit for this. But we are only at the threshold of this perilous
     operation. The greatest risk is a M 6+ earthquake, which could topple the
     spent fuel pool in Reactor 4 or precipitate a criticality in the remaining
     three. We continue to believe that the Japanese government is dangerously
     underestimating the consequences of such an earthquake by not
     collaborating closely with the international community in preparing a
     Global Emergency Contingency Plan. Our affiliated seismologists continue
     to believe that the probability of a M 6 + earthquake originating either
     in Japan
     or within the Ring of Fire with serious consequences on Reactors 1-4 is
     extremely high and will occur sometime in 2014.

Comprehensive Monitoring--One of
     the startling realizations produced by the Campaign is that the west coast
     states are not conducting comprehensive monitoring of radiation levels. We
     have sent a letter to Governor Jerry Brown requesting a meeting and urging
     him to install such a system which is described in the write up in the
     Campaign and our last blog. Accurate monitoring is in everyone’s interest.
     If radiation levels are below regulatory standards, Governor Brown and the
     public can have peace of mind. If the levels exceed regulatory standards
     or are recognized to be dangerous at even lower levels (This is quite
     possible as a regulatory standard is not a guarantee of safety, merely a
     political compromise), at the least the Governor will be forewarned and in
     a position to undertake preemptive action. As of this writing Governor Brown
     has not responded to our request for a meeting.

Potential Breakthroughs—The Explorers’
     Wheel 1.0 we will build is a powerful software program coupled to an imaginative
     web site. Although the Explorers’ Wheel has not received adequate financial
     support, notwithstanding, the Idiegogo Campaign has succeeded in raising
     public consciousness and has identified a number of promising potential
     solutions that we will continue to vet and to offer to the engineers on
     the front lines of Fukushima.
     Some of these potential breakthroughs are described in other parts of the
     Campaign. They include:
An
     innovative entombment strategy proposed by a triple Ph.D. emeritus
     professor of ocean engineering at MIT.
Several
     technologies that will seal the containers currently storing the
     radioactive waste water.
A radically
     different radiation containment strategy. We are currently vetting the
     product(s) and contracting for a series of independent tests of the
     extraordinary claims of the inventor. We will continue to provide reports
     of our progress on our web site.

Medical Challenges—Fukushima presents
     medical challenges involving radiation exposure and illness that the
     international medical community is only beginning to address. At the same
     time there are increasing numbers of cases, especially of thyroid cancer
     in young children in Japan;
     a medical record is being built in the litigation initiated by American
     service men and women on the US Ronald Reagan who were exposed to
     radiation in their rescue attempt during the original March 2011
     explosion. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1K3qzBqjOc

Fukushima
     presents a stark challenge of how to address, treat, and if possible
     prevent a whole range of illnesses (including infectious diseases
     resulting from compromised immune systems) related to greatly increased
     levels of exposure to radiation among unprecedentedly large populations.
     As of this writing the Japanese government has not been forthcoming in
     cooperating with the international medical community. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&feature=em-upload_owner


Political Developments—The tragedy
     of Fukushima continues to unfold against
     the background of poorly conceived national policies both in Japan and the U.S. The clearest example is Japan’s State
     Secrets Protection Law enacted in December 2013. The new law can be
     interpreted to criminalize the release by physicians of vital medical data,
     deemed to be “state secrets,” relating to radiation illnesses of their
     patients. The enactment of the State Secrets Law undermines almost seventy
     years of democratic institutions in Japan. Most troubling is the
     connection of the State Secrets Law with a series of policies being
     implemented by the Obama Administration without Congressional oversight
     hearings, predicated on the premise that a rearmed (even nuclear Japan) is the best deterrent against an
     increasingly hostile China.
     The situation presents an extraordinary opportunity for courageous and
     imaginative members of both the Japanese Diet and U.S. Congress to
     collaborate in holding joint hearings. This would be a historic event. It
     will attract broad media coverage, develop a joint record, and help to
     inform both legislative branches of government and the public. The
     Fukushima Explorers’ Wheel will be a powerful means to educate, engage,
     and empower the public in connection with these proceedings. 
Explorers Wheel 1.0
Your Personal Roadmap to Health, Longevity & Abundance

The
     same platform that will support the Fukushima Explorers’ Wheel will also
     launch other Explorers’ Wheels for humanity. Because Fukushima presents unprecedented risks
     to human health and well being, an Explorer’s Wheel focusing on Your
     Personal Roadmap to Health, Longevity & Abundance is the logical next
     step. We have a detailed Development Plan in place and our Technical Team is
     ready to implement. Again the missing ingredient is financing. The
     Fukushima Explorers Wheel has inspired and will be closely linked to the
     Health, Longevity & Abundance Wheel.
Here
     is the Mission Statement from the Executive Summary—“Our mission is to
     create an entertaining and affordable multiplatform app that will enable millions
     of “explorers” in every country of the world to create their own personal
     roadmap(s) to enhanced health, longevity, and a more abundant life. The
     Explorers Wheel 1.0 will introduce the best available health-related science
     and technology of the West deepened by the wisdom and experience of mind,
     body, and spirit of Eastern and indigenous healing traditions. The Wheel
     will spin and gain momentum by the stories of thousands and thousands of
     explorers, for storytelling is how our minds create, process, and
     transform reality. The Explorers’ Wheel 1.0 will not dispense any form of
     medical or other advice. Rather, it will simply support explorers on their
     own personal journeys into health, longevity, and abundance.”
The
     Health, Longevity & Abundance Wheel will be the subject of a case
     study in a massive open online course (MOOC) we will offer in
     collaboration with Case Western Reserve University in the spring of 2014
     on the theme of “Innovation Integration for the 21st Century.”
Next Steps—Althoughthe
Idiegogo Campaign is ending, our Campaign to bring sanity, compassion, balance,
and intelligence to the challenges of Fukushima
is just beginning. Alliances for Discovery will renew its investment in time
and energy to uncover scientific and technical breakthroughs, while launching
the first of a series of Explorers Wheels that in time will evolve into a
“Global Brain for Humanity.” During the next three months we will be carefully
and critically testing and vetting the
technology of one of our collaborating scientists who may-- just may-- have a
turnkey solution to the horrors of Fukushima. We will continue to keep you
informed through regular blogs and Innovation “Alerts.”  In the meantime, we express our continuing deep
appreciation for your interest and support, and wish you….. 
A Bountiful, Happy, and Healthy 2014.

juliangresser77@gmail.comFukushima: Meeting Global
Crises by Automating Crowd IntelligenceDear
Friends, 
Our goal is to create a phenomenal resource that doesn’t exist today: a Global Brain for Humanity. (Explorers’ Wheel). The Explorer’s Wheel
is a unique software program that mines the intersections among fields, often
the most fertile area of discovery and invention. The software is designed to
support effective collaboration between experts and “creative amateurs” which
is the key to solving many seemingly impossible global problems. Our Team of
Explorers (See Gallery) has been working on the components for over ten years.
We are now ready to bring them together in a coherent system. We propose to
apply this first Explorers’ Wheel to the unfolding nuclear crisis at Fukushima, Japan,
already the most serious nuclear disaster in history. (http://www.explorerswheel.com/blog/inventing-humanitya-collaborative-strategy-global-survival)

Fukushima’s
Cry for Help 
Ambassador Mitsuhei Murata has issued this eloquent and
poignant appeal to the world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn0bXqT1Yhw
Here is the essence of the problem:

The operator Tokyo Electric Power
     Company (TEPCO) has lost control of the situation.
300-400 tons of Tritium, Cesium
     134/137, and Strontium 90 are being discharged into the Pacific
      Ocean each day. This has been going on continuously since the
     accident in March 2011.
TEPCO has begun attempting to remove
     by hand over 1000 hot fuel assemblies, each ½ ton, located in an already
     damaged spent fuel pool 100 ft above the ground. If there is an accident
     the pool can catch fire, the rods can combust, or worst of all, two or more
     of the assemblies could touch and produce a fissionable reaction,
     releasing radioactive contamination into the atmosphere.
The chances of this happening will
     increase dramatically if there is another M 7 earthquake. The pool is
     likely secured to a level M 6 earthquake. There is a high probability of a
     M 6+ earthquake within the next 12 months.
A radioactive plume is heading across
     the Pacific and is anticipated to arrive on the west coast of the U.S. and Hawaii sometime in 2014. The health
     effects at this point are indeterminate. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0rwSpeGRf0&feature=em-upload_owner



Similar conditions exist at other nuclear power plants
in the U.S. such as Diablo Canyon. Diablo Canyon is poised to become a second Fukushima. The plant is not well fortified against a mega-earthquake (M9+)/tsunami as has occurred at Fukushima. The US Geological Survey expects such an earthquake in Alaska or possibly around the Cascadia fault. .(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_subduction_zone). No emergency management plan is in place to protect the citizens of California.NEW!!(12/12/13) Innovation Action Alert # 1--Reliable
Radiation Monitoring for California
and other western states
An Explorers’ Wheel among its many
uses is a powerful tool to invite, aggregate, and focus crowd intelligence on
solving critical global problems. Fukushima is presenting a critical challenge right here in California for which we have already devised
a solution: Comprehensive and reliable monitoring coupled to an innovative
program of public education. 
The Challenge: There are
increasing numbers of reports of serious radioactive contamination arriving on the
west coast of the U.S. from Fukushima. Are reports
like these accurate or exaggerated?
http://www.globalresearch.ca/28-signs-that-the-west-coast-is-being-absolutely-fried-with-nuclear-radiation-from-fukushima/5355280
http://www.turnerradionetwork.com/news/72-mjt
We believe that Governor Jerry Brown has an urgent public duty
to obtain accurate information about the current and emerging situation and to
inform the relevant state agencies and the general public. If based on
comprehensive, continuous, and accurate monitoring, Governor Brown and his
professional team, along with a team of independent
experts and observers, determine that the radioactive contamination is not
a problem, Governor Brown will have done the people of California a great service by allaying fears
and misunderstanding and restoring public trust in government. He will have established a baseline framework and methodology for other U.S. states, indeed nations,
beginning with Japan. On the other hand, if monitoring determines that there is
a serious problem, the State of California
will be in an excellent position to mount an effective Emergency Response Plan.
An Immediately Available
System
We
urge Governor Brown immediately to install a comprehensive program of state
wide radiation monitoring. At present this program does not exist. All the key
elements are available from pioneering companies like International Medcom. A
comprehensive program would include the following:

A Cloud-based Real time
     Monitoring System with Public Access to Data (airborne
     radiation). One sensor detects gamma radiation only and outputs data
     in mR/hr or uSv/hr. The other sensor detects beta and gamma and outputs
     data in CPM.  Each station is also equipped with meteorological
     sensors, a data logger, and an ethernet interface to bring data to a
     central data collection point and to a public website, where data is
     displayed as color coded icons on a map of the state.  Color  of the icons will change with
     radiation levels, with interpretive data accessible through the User
     Interface on the website.
Hand Held Instruments for
     Marine Debris Monitoring-- These are special geiger counters with good
     sensitivity to alpha and beta radiation.  The primary purpose of
     these instruments is to assure the public that radioactive debris from Fukushima is removed
     properly from public beaches and detected.  A secondary purpose is to
     monitor seaweed and marine life for gross contamination.  
Mobile Public Screening and
     Educational Laboratory-- These mobile units will test samples of fish,
     shell fish, seaweed, starfish, marine mammals and other biological media.
     It will serve as a smart educational exchange to reassure the public that
     the State of California
     is vigilant on this issue.
Testing & Analysis
     Laboratory-- The proposed mobile lab will test ocean water for Tritium,
     Cesium 134, Cesium 137 and Strontium 90, the predominant radio-nuclides
     from Fukushima. The lab will also test samples of fish, shell fish,
     seaweed, starfish, marine mammals and other biological media.
Collaborative
Innovation Enabled by an Explorers’ Wheel
If
reports such as the above turn out to be accurate, there will be sudden and
urgent need for innovations that improve the above system. This challenge is an
ideal candidate for a frontier educational initiative organized as
public/private partnership between the State of California and private companies. The goal
would be to tap the imaginative talent of Silicon Valley
and other innovation hubs, integrating frontier technologies of social media,
crowd intelligence, advanced search, smart publishing, 3-D printing, 3-D
visualization, and other relevant platforms. Such a program will go a long way
to reducing fear and misunderstanding about nuclear energy in general, while
building public trust in the Governor Brown’s commitment to protecting the
public.
Inventive Challenges at the Fukushima Site—Fukushima already presents the world with a host of inventive challenges which the experts in Japan will not be able to solve by themselves or by conferring with other experts in their vertical silos of specialty. A creative bridge must be built between the engineers at ground zero and an inspired and informed public. This is where “swarm creativity”* or ""crowd intelligence"" becomes most useful. The Explorers’ Wheel begins to spin with your and the domain experts' questions. Here are some of the most urgent:
How to remove over 1000 fuel assemblies in Reactors 3 & 4 safely?
How to keep the fuel assemblies cool if there is an accident and the pool starts to leak or collapse?
How to divert the stream running under the plants which will help to control the discharges into the ocean?
How to predict the next M6+ earthquake with a lead time of at least one month in order to secure and fortify the spent fuel pools?
How to install widespread monitoring of all radioactive substances, including tritium, Cesium 134/137, Strontium 90, and “hot” nano-particles of plutonium?
How to implement effective and transparent monitoring in a way that inspires and restores public trust in government?
How to develop public health and medical diagnostic and treatment protocols to cope with widespread radiation illnesses?
How to mount an effective global emergency response if and when necessary?
Some
Early Innovative Breakthroughs
Entombment
We
are already gathering and analyzing the most promising innovations. For example,
a triple Ph.D. professor emeritus in ocean engineering from MIT has proposed
entombing Reactors 3 & 4 with a form of liquid concrete that is lighter
than water. The concrete would be dissolved in water and only harden after it
is sprayed on the Reactors. It could be sprayed on the pools from above through
a telescopic nozzle suspended from helicopters. Since the pools are already
being cooled with water, the controlled delivery of additional water should not
in theory further destabilize the pools. We are seeking to obtain design
drawings of Reactors 3 & 4 in order to determine whether entombment can be
accomplished safely. If the liquid concrete can be delivered to penetrate the
entire facility, we may have a way to prevent the further release of radiation
into both air and ocean.
Other
The Japanese government has thus far received over 800 proposed
solutions from around the world. The Idiegogo Campaign is currently analyzing
some of the most promising of these, including novel ways to seal the containers holding radioactive water. This underlies the importance of
developing a mechanism—an imaginative way to automate the process—which can
rapidly analyze, match, enhance, prioritize, and deliver the most promising
breakthroughs to the key decision makers. This is one of several essential functions of an
Explorers’ Wheel.Innovation Alert # 2-- The Ultimate Fukushima Challenge
Can we discover a way to neutralize radiation at Fukushima so that Reactors 1-4 can be rendered non-toxic
and safe, and similarly render neutral and harmless other areas contaminated by
emissions from Fukushima including the Pacific Ocean? This could potentially be a Holy Grail Solution
not only for the Japanese authorities struggling with Fukushima but for the rest of the world
wrestling with how to treat and manage radioactive waste. It is an ideal challenge
for a new approach to harvest crowd intelligence for humanity— a Global
Explorers Mind.
Step # 1—Define the “Core Discovery Puzzle” (CDP) As described in Piloting Through Chaos—The Explorer’s Mind
the first step in the process is to define the “Core Discovery Puzzle(CDP)” in
the language of the domain experts themselves, in this case nuclear engineers.
Here is a simplified explanation:
Radiation is produced by releases of energy from the nucleus
of certain elements such as Tritium, Cesium, Strontium, Uranium, Plutonium,
Xenon, and other elements. This radiation is highly destructive to living cells
because it damages DNA, induces mutations, generates free radicals, and other
harmful effects. Hence the CDP is how to stabilize the nucleus. In other words,
can we discover a way to render the nucleus either completely inert, or to
block or to significantly retard (or dramatically increase) the process of
decay, so that the nucleus becomes stable? Under these conditions the above
elements will remain in a “pure” non-isotopic state. Some experiments have
shown that bombarding these isotopic elements with gamma radiation can actually reduce the radiation. However, this method is not practical or cost effective
for Fukushima,
at least at the moment. Is it possible to devise a practical method which can
be applied immediately and cost effectively?

Step # 2—“Democratizing the CDP”—A Challenge to the Idiegogo
Campaign
The history of science is replete with the contributions of
“creative amateurs” who without advanced degrees conceived breakthroughs of
enormous significance for humanity. Pasteur was not a physician but a
biochemist; Albert Einstein worked as a clerk in a patent office; many
breakthroughs in astronomy are attributed to unheralded imaginative amateurs.
The key is to create a communication
bridge-- a special language built on imagery, metaphor, and stories—
between Sponsors or Seekers and Solution Providers. How many brilliant minds
might be motivated to devise practical solutions for Fukushima if we can level the playing field
by: 1. translating the complex issues into terms that anyone can readily understand
2. packaging the creative responses so they can be rapidly grasped and 3.
priming the problem holders on the front lines at Fukushima to be open to fresh ideas and
different perspectives?
The Challenge: Can you help us depict the above CDP by an
analogy, image, picture, story, or metaphor that is so clear and simple that
any bright eight-year old will understand it? 
Hint # 1: The nucleus will naturally degrade on its own. It
“seeks” a lower energy state under the laws of thermodynamics, which is why it
is throws off particles or waves of energy. We can influence it with a physical
event from the outside—ie. bombarding it with gamma rays. But can you think of
any process or example where something regains an “internal harmony” without
outside interference? It no longer “needs” to look outward to add or subtract
anything? It simply “discovers” or “attains” its own internal balance, harmony,
and stability. Nature and the world’s wisdom traditions may afford some clues,
and there may also be “lead users” in even remote industrial applications. (See
the work of Professor Eric Von Hippel of MIT’s Sloane School)
Crowd Intelligence—We welcome your ideas and input. An
Explorers’ Wheel begins to spin and to gain momentum with the inquiry around
the CDP. Even if you believe your “solution(s)” are farfetched, please don’t
censor yourself. It may turn out that your “lead” will inspire a fellow
explorer, and by “chance” a breakthrough will emerge. Remember the origin of
the word “discover” is the Latin “discoupire” ie. to “uncover.” The breakthrough
may exist already somewhere in the crowd. It is just a matter of giving it a
voice. Chance favors the prepared mind.

This blog is based on a conversation and acknowledges with appreciation the
contributions of Dick Wullaert, Ph.D. President Bioguard Industries, Inc(rawater@cox.net).How the Explorers' Wheel Works
The image on the left is the basic template for an
Explorer’s Wheel which was designed to support a personal discovery process.
Depicted in the center are 8 realms. The image on the right shows how each of
these realms can be expressed in words or pictures. Here is how a similar
template can be usefully applied in addressing one of the world’s most complex
and urgent calamities: the continuing nuclear disaster at Fukushima.
Step 1: Adapting the Wheel—The basic template can be
customized to your areas of greatest interest and concern. For example, the
following 8 realms might encompass Fukushima and similar disasters:
“Solutions,” “Medical,” “Aid to Victims,” “Monitoring,” “Emergency Management,”
“Advocacy,” “Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and Other Causes,” and “Guidance” (Wise
Decision Making).
Step 2: Inputting Your Data—Simply click the spiral and
input your core question or desired area of exploration. You can then begin to
input your other important ideas, themes, pictures, or stories into any of the
8 realms. Each realm can transform into its own 8-realm template, as
illustrated above.
Step 3: A Collective Discovery Engine—The Explorer’s Wheel
is a continuously evolving, intelligent, and transforming Discovery Engine. It
records, analyzes, synthesizes, and aggregates your contributions and those of
every other explorer. It is “smart”-- it continuously learns 24/7 from you and
everyone else in the Network. The more its members contribute, the faster the
Wheel learns and works on developing solutions to the problem(s). 
Step 4: Accessing Discoveries—The Explorer’s Wheel is
available to you anywhere, anytime. It will be designed to run on any major
platform and on any device. All you need to do is click into the Network. The
Explorers’ Wheel becomes your personal learning portal.
Technology
Development Note
The Explorers' World Platform will be supported by five (5) online
engines:  


The Explorers' Mind Engine: To help
     explorers develop powerful tools and skills to support them on their
     journey.

The Explorers' Wheel Engine: To provide
     a coherent framework to enable explorers to discover new and surprising
     connections between diverse fields and domains of knowledge. 

The Explorers' World Transformation
Engine: To create a
     “translation engine” which will express and translate complex and
     technical fields of expertise into images, metaphors, pictures, and
     stories that people everywhere can easily grasp; and by this
     Transformation Engine establish a unique communications bridge between domain experts and creative
     amateurs.

The Explorers' Circle Accelerator Engine: To develop a living
     intelligent platform—a global brain-- that learns about each explorer 24/7
     and can provide instant and useful feedback and guidance for wide range of
     activities, including project management.

The Explorers' Customer &
     Marketplace Engine: To create
     non-profit humanitarian applications which will monetize the psychographic
     data bases, archives, libraries, tools, and collaborative intellectual
     property contributed by explorers throughout the networks.
Many of the core elements listed above have already been
conceived and tested, and in some instances, already developed in earlier
ventures by the Core Team. Our most important technical challenge will be how
to integrate these diverse elements into a “global brain” that will include
some of the most interesting features and skill sets of social media, crowd
sourcing, advanced search, smart technologies, narrative platforms, and gaming.
We have identified some talented software programmers who will become an
integral part of our Core Team.Why is the Explorers’ Wheel Unique?
The Explorers’ Wheel will build upon and extend the present
capabilities of popular social media and crowd sourcing platforms such as Quora
(www.quora.com):

It
     will enable explorers to discover the “gold” at the intersection of
     conventional disciplines, which is often the most fertile area for
     discovery and invention. (See Piloting
     Through Chaos—The Explorer’s Mind (www.explorerswheel.com)
The
     Explorers’ Wheel contains a wisdom algorithm to help explorers make wiser
     decisions.
The
     platform is “smart,” meaning it learns along with each explorer and will
     provide continuous personalized feedback based on what it learns from the
     network.
The
     Explorers’ Wheel will include a “Discovery Engine” which will make
     available the best techniques of discovery and invention engineering and
     collaborative innovation. 
The
     Explorers"" Wheel will build a bridge that will help experts and creative
     amateurs communicate more effectively in solving global challenges. In
     other words, it contains an algorithm to “translate” complex scientific
     and technical questions into simple images, metaphors, and pictures so
     even a child can understand them; and then it will translate back the
     imaginative insights of non-experts so that professionals can appreciate
     and act on them.
The
     Explorers’ Wheel includes an advanced and proven system of artful
     negotiation which enables users to transform their dreams into practical
     and measurable results.
The
     Explorers' Wheel is designed to expand the “market share” of kindness,
     empathy, and generosity in the world, imperceptibly and without preaching about it.
Thank
You for Your Support!
Your support will help us address the critical issues at Fukushima and also
improve the Explorer's Wheel, so that we can apply it in the future, with increasing
confidence, to clusters of other serious challenges. As noted, our longer term
goal is to create a 'living global brain' - a vast self-organizing network and expert
system reflecting our collective intelligence and wisdom. This 'collective
mind' will help us to anticipate and avoid crises, to solve problems better and
faster, and to take advantage of promising opportunities. 

To do this successfully will require bringing together many
people with specific knowledge and wisdom. We invite you to join with us in
contributing to this vision and in spreading the word to your friends,
family and colleagues.  Please let them know that all of us together can
help to solve the Fukushima
challenge successfully - and that doing this together will put us in a far
better position to move forward consciously and to create other worthwhile
projects that can dramatically shape our future and the world we live in.
Rewards—Idiegogo
permits us to offer Rewards for your help to us.In addition to the listed
Rewards our friends are joining us by contributing bonus awards. Here is a
first extra reward. It is a print of the Goddess Protector of the Oceans
created by our friend and partner Mayumi Oda, a famous artist and
environmentalist. We will email you this print along with other Rewards
conceived and contributed by members as the Campaign gains momentum. Mayumi
informs us there is only a few of these prints left. It is included as a bonus
to the $ 300 Reward.
Our Partners—Because this Campaign involves complex and serious issues
of great political, legal, and international significance, far beyond the
capacities of a single individual, or even our small and determined team, we
are joining forces with powerful environmental and other activist organizations
which have a demonstrated track record of commitment and successful advocacy on
the nuclear issues. Our initial proposed partners are: Friends of the Earth (www.foe.org/) and the Surfriders
Foundation (www.surfrider.org/).
We are actively inviting other professional organizations to join the Campaign. The Campaign
We
are already generating considerable momentum from these activities and other
planned events:
·  The concerns of thousands of global citizens who are presenting petitions to the UN drawing upon our advice and
support.
· A conference held on October 24 and
sponsored by the UN Association of Santa Barbara and that produced a Protocol
expressing a Call to Action on Fukushima See:www.explorerswheel.com/blog
· A team in Japan which has direct access to
the key decision makers in the Japanese government. This will ensure a hearing
on ideas generated by the Explorers’ Wheel.
· A massive open online course (MOOC) on
“Accelerating Breakthroughs for Fukushima
and the Coming Global Emergency Response.” It is actively being planned with
Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and will be launched early in 2014.
· An Innovation Summit
being planned in Tokyo
for the spring of 2014.
· A massive campaign contemplated by
Friends of the Earth, applying the lessons of Fukushima and the new skills of
cyber-advocacy as introduced in the Explorers Wheel, demanding appropriate
safeguards as precondition for
re-licensing of Diablo Canyon, including accurate monitoring of radiation
levels.
· A movement of millions of women in Japan
and around the world who are uniting to protest the hazards of radiation to
themselves and their children. The Fukushima/Other Disasters Explorers’ Wheel will especially
honor the contributions and sacrifices of these women explorers and advocates.
Project Budget
The
total budget for the project is $ 350,000 which covers the costs of software
development, consultants on emergency management, story telling, and Japan. It will
also pay for equipment, communications, marketing, licenses, administration,
and travel. We can deliver the complete Fukushima/Diablo Explorers’ Wheel
within six (6) months.
We
are prepared to deliver the Explorers’ Wheel in
stages if for some reason we
cannot raise the full amount immediately:
· $ 50,000 will enable us to get started,
to build a collaborative cyber-advocacy web site equipped with advanced search
capability, advocacy training materials, and some smart features.
· $ 100,000 will enable us to build a
basic smart interactive Explorers’ Wheel web site, with some advanced
collaborative and search capabilities linked to Explorer’s Wheel and the MOOC
on Accelerating Breakthroughs for Fukushima and the Global Emergency Response.
· $ 200,000 will enable us to enhance
the platform with story telling tools, and introduce a Discovery Engine of best
techniques of creative problem solving, discovery/invention engineering, and
collaborative innovation.
· $ 350,000 will enable us to complete the first full embodiment of the Explorer's Wheel.
Additional Stretch Goals:
Stretch Goal #1 - $500,000
· Voice recognition
· More powerful advanced 3-D graphics
· More advanced esoteric predictive
capabilities

Vjerovatno ima nekih boljih, ali do njih je za sad nemoguće doći.<br/>Računam da će, ovako atraktivan starinski jedrenjak, sa najmodernijom, a sasvim pristupačnom  tehnologijom, koja zbog starih navika  još nema masovnu primjenu, sa popularnim kapetanom koga mediji temeljno prate, dati odličan primer i motiv da se pređe na električne motore i solarni pogon.<br/>Možda najvažnija pasija koju imam je borba za čistiju  planetu uvođenjem čiste tehnologije. Tehnologija je već tu, ona  donosi ogromne uštede u gorivu, novcu, eliminaciji zagađenja. Promjena ljudskih navika je nešto na čemu radim već neko vrijeme, kroz moje javno djelovanje. Užasno je gledati te naftne fleke koje svaki  motor sa unutrašnjim sagorijevanjem  pušta u manjoj ili većoj mjeri. Uz to, gorivo moraš da kupiš, a sunce sija džabe!</p>

<p>Jedriti sa brodom dizajniranim prije više od 100 godina, a biti brz jednako kao današnje, moderne jedrilice, nekako mi se namentulo kao izazov.

<p>Jedriti u potpunoj tišini restauriranim oldtajmerom, koji će biti vrhunac “zelene” tehnologije, ispred nosa ""motornjacima"" koji   zagađuju more,  troše zalihe kiseonika baš kao njihovi vlasnici zalihe iz novčanika, dok pritom moraju slušati mumlanje, turpijanje i arlaukanje sopstvenog motora usred tihe pučine. </p>

<p>Današnja tehnologija već omogućuje da na ovom kuteru imam električni motor, i baterije koje se pune uz pomoć solarnih kolektora. Velika paluba omogućuje bar pet kvadrata solarnih kolektora, što je više nego dovoljno. Baterije se pune na sunce čitav dan, a onda motor služi samo za uplovljenje i isplovljenje - i to ponekad. Volim da isplovljavam i uplovljavam na jedra. Motor je dakle tu za neke nepredviđene situacije, 1 h autonomije sa brzinom od 5KNT mi je više nego dovoljno.</p>

<p>Jedan od ciljeva je i medijsko lobiranje da lučke kapetanije,  marine i pristaništa prestanu da naplaćuju vez i plovidbene dozvole indexirane po dužnom metru plovila, već po konjskoj snazi motora. Apsurdno je da jedrilica, duga 20 metara, sa motorom od 150 konja, plaća veću cijenu od motorne jahte koja ima 15 metara i motorčinu od  3 000 konjskih snaga. Apsurdno je da eko taksa bude ista za jedrilice koje klize pored obale bez buke i talasa, i motornjake koji oru more, prave ogromne valove, i u zalivima trajno narušavaju obalu, floru i faunu, bukom uznemiravaju čitav živi svijet, uključujući i čovjeka. </p>

<h2><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b><i>“Sailing is poetry in motion""</i></b></b></h2>
<p></p>
<p><i>Sailing is not the fun of snobs who fool around and show off on overpriced boats while the poor frolic in the sea. Today, you can buy a second-hand sailing boat for the price of a 10-year old car. And sail immediately. </i></p>
<p><i>Sailing is the great-grandfather of energy efficiency. On a sailing boat, I used less fuel in 10 years than a speed-boat of the same length burns in an hour. And, at the same time, I spent far more time actually out at sea, which I imagine is the point when you have a boat.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>The sailboat’s speed is very important to me. When I see drunken tourists lolling downwind on a chartered boat with their sails all tied up, I get the same knots in my stomach as those binding a sail in the hands of ignoramuses. I love it when a sailing boat catches the wind, strongly beating up, cutting the waves with the precision of a good knife cutting through cheese, with the sails trimmed with no slack.</i></p>
<h2><b><i>I like the restoration of old, rejected things</i></b></h2>
<p><i>I restored an old guitar that I found next to a garbage container, an old Fiat (the famous “Fićo”) <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">which I am about to register and proudly drive around town. I have installed a natural gas tank so it </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">will be an “Eco Fićo”. I even got excited about restoring an old BMW motorbike, but when I </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">reminded myself that I never rode a motorcycle and am not interested in starting now, I gave it to </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">my neighbour, a passionate motorcyclist and a top car painter, so he can restore it to perfection.</span></i></p>
<p><i>My father was an archaeologist and a restorer, and I have caught his passion, completely <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">unintentionally.</span></i></p>
<h2><i>I like Cutters</i></h2>
<p><i>During my military service in Split back in 1982, as a competitive sailor I had been reassigned to <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">assist in the sailing and rowing training of marine officers. Along with modern sailboats there were </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">these so-called ‘cutters’, elegant 100-year old boats which, propelled only by oars and pure human </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">strength reached the incredible speed of 6 knots! With the sails at broad reach it became even </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">faster.</span></i></p>
<p><i>The love of that boat took hold somehow and, 30 years later, I found the old wreck you see in the <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">photos.</span></i></p>
<h2><i>I like planet Earth</i></h2>
<p><i>I like the whole Universe but Earth is the most hospitable and pleasant territory I know of. There <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">might be better ones out there, but they are impossible to reach for the moment.</span></i></p>
<p><i>I believe that an attractive antique sailboat with state-of-the-art affordable technology (which due <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">to old habits has not yet been universally used) and a popular captain who receives a lot of media </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">attention, can and will provide an excellent example and motive to switch to electrical engines and </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">solar power.</span></i></p>
<p><i>Perhaps my most important passion is the battle for a cleaner planet through cleaner technology. </i></p>
<p><i>The technology is already here and brings great savings in fuel, money and the elimination of <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">pollution. For some time already, I have used my public work to bring about a change in people’s </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">habits.  It is terrible to see the oil slicks left by all interior combustion engines. Besides, you have to </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">buy fuel while the sun shines for free!</span></i></p>
<h2><i>And what do I want?</i></h2>
<p><i>This project is actually the collection of all my tendencies, hobbies and passions in one place. Simply <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">put, this solar sailboat is the prototype of my dreams.</span></i></p>
<p><i>Somehow, it became a challenge to sail on a boat designed over 100 years ago and to be as fast as <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">today’s sailboats. I keep dreaming of regattas in which helmsmen on modern boats go green with </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">jealousy and envy when they realize in disbelief that they had just been overtaken by a boat </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">designed a hundred years before theirs. </span></i></p>
<p><i>And then I want them to go green for a different reason.</i></p>
<p><i>Sailing in complete silence with a restored old-timer which will be the pinnacle of ‘green’ <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">technology, in front of the noses of the motor boats which are polluting the sea depleting the </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">oxygen reserves just like their owners deplete their financial reserves, all the while listening to the </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">humming, droning or screaming of their own motors disturbing the quiet open seas. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This boat will be an incredible incentive to change habits and, if it convinces only speed-boat owner </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">to switch from gas to wind, we will have taken the first, most important step in saving the Adriatic.</span></i></p>
<p><i>Modern technology makes it possible for me to have an electrical motor and batteries which can <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">recharge through solar collectors. The big deck allows for at least 5 m2 of solar collectors which is </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">more than enough. The batteries recharge all day and the motor is only used for the occasional </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">sailing in and out of ports. I like to sail in and out on wind power. The engine is there also for </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">unforeseen situations. An hour of self-sufficiency with a speed of 5 knots is more than enough.</span></i></p>
<p><i>One of my goals is to lobby through the media for port authorities, harbours and marinas to stop <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">charging for mooring on the basis of the length of a vessel but on the horsepower of its engine. It is </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">absurd that a 20m sailboat with a 150hp engine pays more than a 15m motor yacht with a huge </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">3,000hp engine. It is absurd that the environmental tax for sailboats that glide along the coast </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">without noise and waves is the same as that for motor boats which plow the sea, make huge waves </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">and permanently destroy the coast and its flora and fauna while disturbing all living things, humans </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">included, with their noise.</span></i></p>

Retro-futur koncept primjene novih tehnologija u zaštiti kuturne baštine.
U Procesu rada na solarnom retro jedrenjaku, pokušali smo da revitalizujemo stari vojnički kuter, medjutim ispostavilo se da je to veoma skupo, nepraktično, i da će rezultat biti... nedovoljno kvalitetan, trup bi bio suviše težak, električni motor bi morao da bude mnogo jači, energetska efikasnost ne bi bila idealna.
Odlučili smo da uzmemo identičan trup- korito, uradjeno u West sistemu, Nov, tvrd, jak, moderan, lak, sa apslolutno zadržanim istim dizajnom, da bi ostvarili unaprijed zadati cilj. Imati jedrenjak koji je sačuvao svoju originalnu liniju , geometriju, izgled, ali da pri tom bude maksimalno trajan, funkionalan , lak i brz.
Do sada smo skupili 20 700 dolara. 
Od tog novca kupili smo trup- u west sistemu od Brodogradilišta Enavigo, Virovitica: 11 000 $, u tu cijenu uračunat je i prevoz do Kalafatarske radionice Bokovac u BAru, 
Slijedi plaćanje carine- oko 2 000 $Preostali poslovi

  Nadogradnja kobilice


  Nadogradnja palube


  Izrada Jarbola, koloturnika. 


   Izrada jedara


   Kupvina konopa


   Solarni sistem


   Navigacijski uredjaji


   Sredjivanje potpalublja za duža krstarenja. 


Obavijestit ću vas kako napreduje! I još jednom hvala!

English summaryWe will restore an old navy cutter and create a retro-futuristic sailboat that will promote sustainable solutions. The reconstructed solar cutter will feature an original wooden hull and classic rigging and sails combined with a solar-powered engine. The mission of the boat is to promote clean energy in the Adriatic and it will be open to organizations fighting for the same cause.


You can support this cause by picking some of the perks or just by making a donation. If you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

""Jedrenje je poezija kretanja""
Jedrenje nije snobovsko zajebavanje preskupim brodovima i razmetanje pred sirotinjom koja se brčka u moru.  Danas možete nabaviti polovnu jedrilicu za cijenu auta starog 10 godina. I odmah jedriti.Jedrenje je prađede energetske efikasnosti. Sa svojom  jedrilicom nisam za 10 godina potrošio goriva koliko jedan vlasnik  glisera iste dužine sprži za sat vremena.  A pri tom provedem na moru, u plovidbi,  višestruko više vremena od njega , što je valjda i cilj kad imaš plovilo.Brzina jedrilice mi je izuzetno važna. Kad vidim neke pijane turiste kako se valjaju na čarteru niz vjetar stegnutih jedara, srce mi se stegne baš kao i to jedro u rukama neznalica. Volim kad jedrilica optimalno hvata vjetar, ""orca"" oštro u vjetar, precizno siječe talase kao što dobar nož siječe mladi sir, dok su jedra natrimovana da se na brzini ne gubi ni milimetar.Volim restauraciju starih, odbačenih stvari.Obnovio sam jednu staru gitaru, koju sam našao pored kontejnera za smeće, starog fiću,  kog ovih dana treba da registrujem i s ponosom vozim po gradu. Ugradio sam mu i plin, da bude Eko Fićo. Čak sam se palio da restauriram jedan stari BMW motocikl, ali, čim sam osvijestio činjenicu da motocikl nikad nisam vozio, niti me to zanima, brže bolje sam ga poklonio komšiji , pasioniranom motociklisti, uz to vrhunskom autolakireru, koji će imati znanja vremena I živaca da ga dotjera do perfekcije.Otac mi je bio arheolog, restaurator, potpuno nenamjerno  sam pokupio tu pasiju od njega. 





Volim Kutere
U vojsci, u Splitu, davne 1982 , već kao jedriličar takmičar sam dobio prekomandu da pomažem u obuci mornaričkih oficira u jedrenju I veslanju. Pored modernih jedrilica, tu su bili I takozvani “kuteri”, elegantne, barke 100 godina stare koje su, gonjene veslima i čistom ljudskom snagom dostizale nevjerovatnu brzinu od 6 čvorova! Na jedra,  u ""pola krme"" dostizao je i više.
Ljubav prema tom brodu se nekako ukorijenila , I ja sam nakon 30 godina došao u posjed jednog, prilično raspalog kutera, čije slike vidite.




Volim planetu Zemlju
Volim ja i čitav Kosmos, ali Zemlja je najgostoljubivija i najprijatnija teritorija za koju znam. Vjerovatno ima nekih boljih, ali do njih je za sad nemoguće doći.Računam da će, ovako atraktivan starinski jedrenjak, sa najmodernijom, a sasvim pristupačnom  tehnologijom, koja zbog starih navika  još nema masovnu primjenu, sa popularnim kapetanom koga mediji temeljno prate, dati odličan primer i motiv da se pređe na električne motore i solarni pogon.Možda najvažnija pasija koju imam je borba za čistiju  planetu uvođenjem čiste tehnologije. Tehnologija je već tu, ona  donosi ogromne uštede u gorivu, novcu, eliminaciji zagađenja. Promjena ljudskih navika je nešto na čemu radim već neko vrijeme, kroz moje javno djelovanje. Užasno je gledati te naftne fleke koje svaki  motor sa unutrašnjim sagorijevanjem  pušta u manjoj ili većoj mjeri. Uz to, gorivo moraš da kupiš, a sunce sija džabe!




A šta to ja 'oću?


Ovaj projekt je zapravo zbir svih mojih afiniteta, hobija i pasija na jednom mjestu. Ovaj Solarni jedrenjak je, jednostavno rečeno, prototip mojih snova.
Jedriti sa brodom dizajniranim prije više od 100 godina, a biti brz jednako kao današnje, moderne jedrilice, nekako mi se namentulo kao izazov. Stalno maštam kako će se na regatama kormilari na modernim brodovima pušiti od ljubomore I zavisti kad u nevjerici budu shvatili da ih je upravo prestigao brod dizajniran 100 godina prije njihovog.


Jedriti u potpunoj tišini restauriranim oldtajmerom, koji će biti vrhunac “zelene” tehnologije, ispred nosa ""motornjacima"" koji   zagađuju more,  troše zalihe kiseonika baš kao njihovi vlasnici zalihe iz novčanika, dok pritom moraju slušati mumlanje, turpijanje i arlaukanje sopstvenog motora usred tihe pučine. 
Ovaj brod će biti ogroman  podstrek za  promjene navika  i ako preobrati  samo jednog  gliseraša  da pređe sa benzina na vjetar, učinili smo prvi, najvažniji korak za očuvanje Jadrana. 
Današnja tehnologija već omogućuje da na ovom kuteru imam električni motor, i baterije koje se pune uz pomoć solarnih kolektora. Velika paluba omogućuje bar pet kvadrata solarnih kolektora, što je više nego dovoljno. Baterije se pune na sunce čitav dan, a onda motor služi samo za uplovljenje i isplovljenje - i to ponekad. Volim da isplovljavam i uplovljavam na jedra. Motor je dakle tu za neke nepredviđene situacije, 1 h autonomije sa brzinom od 5KNT mi je više nego dovoljno.



Jedan od ciljeva je i medijsko lobiranje da lučke kapetanije,  marine i pristaništa prestanu da naplaćuju vez i plovidbene dozvole indexirane po dužnom metru plovila, već po konjskoj snazi motora. Apsurdno je da jedrilica, duga 20 metara, sa motorom od 150 konja, plaća veću cijenu od motorne jahte koja ima 15 metara i motorčinu od  3 000 konjskih snaga. Apsurdno je da eko taksa bude ista za jedrilice koje klize pored obale bez buke i talasa, i motornjake koji oru more, prave ogromne valove, i u zalivima trajno narušavaju obalu, floru i faunu, bukom uznemiravaju čitav živi svijet, uključujući i čovjeka. 




Ovo je plan razvoja broda:
Brod će na kraju ipak biti u mom vlasništvu,  ali pristup na solarni jedrenjak  biće otvoren  za sve učesnike u ovom projektu, ekološka udruženja,  autore eko emisija i eko projekata, sve radoznale moreplovce koji žele da primjene  naš koncept na svojim plovilima. 


Dakle, to će biti ploveće učilo. Sailing edutainment ship.  






Kako bi ovaj brod zaplovio Jadranom, povećao ekološku svijest ljudi, preobraćivao bahate gliseraše  i omogućio mi da uhvatim inspiraciju na valovima - potrebno mi je vaše učešće.
Dakle, optimalno je da u finansiranju ovog projekta učestvuje puno zainteresovanih  ljudi, koji će finansirati po malo, ali pomalo i biti dio projekta, što je i suština crowdfundinga. Naravno, nikako ne želim da prisiljavam ljude koji su u egzistencijalnim problemima da se izlažu bespotrebnim troškovima, svakako da imaju prečih stvari u životu nego što je ovaj projekt. 
Ja sam naravno sa svoje strane pripremio  par zanimljivih poklona za sve koji bi ipak učestovali:





Šta bih vam više reko, nego hvala što učestvujete u ostvarenju jednog sna koji je čini mi se, jednako lijep, koliko i koristan za blagotvoran uticaj na društvo i okolinu.

“Sailing is poetry in motion""

Sailing is not the fun of snobs who fool around and show off on overpriced boats while the poor frolic in the sea. Today, you can buy a second-hand sailing boat for the price of a 10-year old car. And sail immediately. 
Sailing is the great-grandfather of energy efficiency. On a sailing boat, I used less fuel in 10 years than a speed-boat of the same length burns in an hour. And, at the same time, I spent far more time actually out at sea, which I imagine is the point when you have a boat.
The sailboat’s speed is very important to me. When I see drunken tourists lolling downwind on a chartered boat with their sails all tied up, I get the same knots in my stomach as those binding a sail in the hands of ignoramuses. I love it when a sailing boat catches the wind, strongly beating up, cutting the waves with the precision of a good knife cutting through cheese, with the sails trimmed with no slack.
I like the restoration of old, rejected things
I restored an old guitar that I found next to a garbage container, an old Fiat (the famous “Fićo”) which I am about to register and proudly drive around town. I have installed a natural gas tank so it will be an “Eco Fićo”. I even got excited about restoring an old BMW motorbike, but when I reminded myself that I never rode a motorcycle and am not interested in starting now, I gave it to my neighbour, a passionate motorcyclist and a top car painter, so he can restore it to perfection.
My father was an archaeologist and a restorer, and I have caught his passion, completely unintentionally.
I like Cutters
During my military service in Split back in 1982, as a competitive sailor I had been reassigned to assist in the sailing and rowing training of marine officers. Along with modern sailboats there were these so-called ‘cutters’, elegant 100-year old boats which, propelled only by oars and pure human strength reached the incredible speed of 6 knots! With the sails at broad reach it became even faster.
The love of that boat took hold somehow and, 30 years later, I found the old wreck you see in the photos.
I like planet Earth
I like the whole Universe but Earth is the most hospitable and pleasant territory I know of. There might be better ones out there, but they are impossible to reach for the moment.
I believe that an attractive antique sailboat with state-of-the-art affordable technology (which due to old habits has not yet been universally used) and a popular captain who receives a lot of media attention, can and will provide an excellent example and motive to switch to electrical engines and solar power.
Perhaps my most important passion is the battle for a cleaner planet through cleaner technology. 
The technology is already here and brings great savings in fuel, money and the elimination of pollution. For some time already, I have used my public work to bring about a change in people’s habits.  It is terrible to see the oil slicks left by all interior combustion engines. Besides, you have to buy fuel while the sun shines for free!
And what do I want?
This project is actually the collection of all my tendencies, hobbies and passions in one place. Simply put, this solar sailboat is the prototype of my dreams.
Somehow, it became a challenge to sail on a boat designed over 100 years ago and to be as fast as today’s sailboats. I keep dreaming of regattas in which helmsmen on modern boats go green with jealousy and envy when they realize in disbelief that they had just been overtaken by a boat designed a hundred years before theirs. 
And then I want them to go green for a different reason.
Sailing in complete silence with a restored old-timer which will be the pinnacle of ‘green’ technology, in front of the noses of the motor boats which are polluting the sea depleting the oxygen reserves just like their owners deplete their financial reserves, all the while listening to the humming, droning or screaming of their own motors disturbing the quiet open seas. This boat will be an incredible incentive to change habits and, if it convinces only speed-boat owner to switch from gas to wind, we will have taken the first, most important step in saving the Adriatic.
Modern technology makes it possible for me to have an electrical motor and batteries which can recharge through solar collectors. The big deck allows for at least 5 m2 of solar collectors which is more than enough. The batteries recharge all day and the motor is only used for the occasional sailing in and out of ports. I like to sail in and out on wind power. The engine is there also for unforeseen situations. An hour of self-sufficiency with a speed of 5 knots is more than enough.
One of my goals is to lobby through the media for port authorities, harbours and marinas to stop charging for mooring on the basis of the length of a vessel but on the horsepower of its engine. It is absurd that a 20m sailboat with a 150hp engine pays more than a 15m motor yacht with a huge 3,000hp engine. It is absurd that the environmental tax for sailboats that glide along the coast without noise and waves is the same as that for motor boats which plow the sea, make huge waves and permanently destroy the coast and its flora and fauna while disturbing all living things, humans included, with their noise.

This is the development plan of the sailboat:



November 2016 Restoration of the hull 
Full 2017 Hull lacquered and decorated 
April 2017 Sails sewn 
May 2017 Sailboat launch 
August 2017 Installation of solar panels 
September 2017 Sailing the Adriatic 

Although I will be the sailboat’s owner, access to it will be open to those participating in the project, to environmental associations, to authors of media broadcasts dedicated to environmental issues and other eco-projects as well as to curious seafarers who would like to apply the concept to their vessels. 
Thus, this will be a sailing educational tool – “an edutainment sailboat”.
In order to achieve this – to make it possible for this sailboat to sail the Adriatic and increase people’s environmental awareness, convert arrogant speedboaters and allow me to catch the inspiration of the waves – I need your help.
Ideally, and in line with the concept of crowdfunding, this project should be financed by many people who would each make a small contribution and also participate in the project. Needless to say, I have no intention of forcing people with financial problems to expose themselves to unnecessary costs. There are certainly more important things in life than this project. 

What else can I say, other than to thank you for taking part in the realization of a dream which I believe to be as beautiful as it is useful and beneficial for society and the environment.

single-day volunteer effort for public lands. 
In 2014, over 175,000 volunteers across the country helped improve over
2,000 public land sites in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto
Rico.  Their efforts equated to an estimated
$18 million
worth of improvements to public lands!  In 2015, our goal
is to reach more volunteers than ever before and care for every corner of
America’s backyard, but we need your help…
What We Need 
With stretched budgets and limited
staff, land managers at federal, state and local public lands need all the help
they can get.  NPLD is a great way to lend our
public lands and the groups that support them an extra helping hand.  With your assistance in raising $5,000 now, we
can start early to attract more volunteers and support additional green spaces
in 2015.  And save the date to
volunteer—September 26, 2015!What will my donation make possible?

Your donation of $5 will attract an NPLD volunteer


Your donation of $20 will provide shovels and gloves for an NPLD volunteer

That volunteer will multiply the
impact of your donation by contributing an estimated $90 worth of labor!

Your donation of $50 will enable an NPLD site manager to create promotional materials


Your donation of $75 will provide tools (e.g. plants, lumber, paint) for an NPLD project


Your donation of $100 will provide refreshments for volunteers at an NPLD site


Your donation of $150 will reward hardworking volunteers at an NPLD site with t-shirts


Your donation of $500 will attract a new public land site to participate in NPLD

That site will multiply the impact of your donation
by contributing an estimated $9,000 worth of improvements!

Your donation of $1,000 will help a public land engage their local community in enjoying the site beyond NPLD

NPLD Project ExampleThe Fort McClellan Army National Guard Training Center (ARNGTC) in Alabama
provides public hunting opportunities as part of their natural resources
management plan and game management program. 
Fort McClellan ARNGTC wanted to include recreational access for youth
and people with disabilities so they hosted an NPLD event.  In September 2014, volunteers constructed and
placed three sportsmen blinds designed to assist disabled hunters, provided a
level path leading to the blinds (for those using wheelchairs or canes),
removed invasive species and planted native oak trees near each blind.  The disabled community—including retirees,
veterans, Wounded Warriors and anyone with a mental or physical disability—and
youth hunters may now independently access Fort McClellan ARNGTC for an
improved hunting experience.
Who We Are & What We Do
NEEF
is the nation’s leading organization in lifelong environmental learning,
connecting people to knowledge they use to improve the quality of their lives
and the health of the planet.  We achieve
this by providing knowledge to trusted professionals and other leaders who,
with their credibility, amplify messages to national audiences to solve everyday
environmental problems.  We envision:  “By
2022, 300 million Americans actively use environmental knowledge to ensure the
well-being of the earth and its people.”
NEEF launched NPLD in 1994 with three sites and
700 volunteers.  It proved to be a huge
success and became a yearly tradition, typically held on the last Saturday in
September.  NPLD continues to improve and
restore the lands and facilities that Americans use for recreation, education
and volunteerism.

<p>Soclogbo est un petit village au centre du Bénin niché au milieu des collines. Il compte environ 5000 habitants. Soclogbo dispose des infrastructures suivantes : un centre de santé, un centre social, un jardin d’enfants, trois écoles primaires, un collège (qui accueille les élèves de 6è en terminales), un château d’eau et un réseau de distribution d’eau potable…</p>
<p><img alt=""Bienvenue à Soclogbo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/866151/pictures/full/20130612083526-soclogbo-bienvenue.jpg?1371051330"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Bienvenue à Soclogbo""/></p>
<p>À Soclogbo, les arbres centenaires comme le baobab, le Néré et l’iroko sont en symbiose avec le paysage accidenté des collines et des vallées …. La vie de ce village s’organise autour de l’agriculture, de la vente des produits issus du travail de la terre ainsi que d’une grande production de bois, – pour la confection des charpentes, la réalisation de meubles et la création d’objets d’art grâce à la sculpture – et de charbon de bois.</p>
<p>Pourtant, une ombre au tableau menace l’écosystème : l’avancée du désert. Additionnée à la surexploitation des ressources, l’absence d’une politique pérenne de reboisement, la situation empire lentement. Des essences séculaires sont attaquées, détruites et brûlées pour satisfaire la demande pressante des grandes villes. Grâce à cette surexploitation de la forêt, certains gagnent l’illusion du pain quotidien et mettent en péril l’avenir de la région. Ce cercle vicieux hypothèque l’avenir des jeunes et des enfants, qui demain vivront dans une région toujours plus sèche et toujours plus aride.</p>
<p align=""center""> <img alt=""La saison sèche se rallonge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/866153/pictures/full/20130612083647-soclogbo-secheresse.jpg?1371051413"" src="""" style="""" title=""La natur est menacée""/></p>
<p>Née en avril 2010, l’association <em>Mémoire de Clair de Lune</em> est active dans le domaine de l’environnement, de la culture et du sport. Elle est mue par la volonté de préserver l’authenticité de ce village en menant différentes actions sur le terrain :</p>
<ul>
<li>la sensibilisation des populations locales à l’impérieuse nécessité de reboiser et d’assainir l’environnement ;</li>
<li>les campagnes de reboisement, notamment la campagne 2013</li>
<li>l’action culturelle notamment autour du livre de jeunesse ;</li>
<li>la protection de l’environnement par la création d’un parc, jardin ou square.</li>
</ul>
<p>Les membres de l’Association <em>Mémoire de Clair de Lune</em> s’investissent personnellement dans ces missions. Ils organisent entre autres activités, le Marathon <em>Maxhili</em>, la semaine du livre de jeunesse, la campagne permanente de reboisement et d’embellissement qui connaît un pic à la saison pluvieuse.</p>
<p><img alt=""Quelques images du marathon Maxili"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/866157/pictures/full/20130612083907-imgProjet-MarathonMaxili.jpg?1371051550"" src="""" style="""" title=""Le marathon au village de Soclogbo""/></p>
<p>Dans son volet environnement, l’association veut <strong>aider à la prise de conscience</strong> et <strong>montrer par l’exemple qu’il est possible de changer le cours des événements</strong>. L’association a fait le pari de reverdir le village et les tentatives de reboisement sont nombreuses. Les activités menées sur le terrain montrent que les habitants accueillent favorablement les idées nouvelles et font preuve de bonne volonté. Les plants sont souvent spontanément accueillis et mis en terre.</p>
<p>Par ailleurs, un terrain de 2 hectares est à la disposition de l’Association afin qu’elle l’exploite au service du village. Plusieurs essences du milieu s’y trouvent naturellement. <strong>Le but du présent projet est de délimiter des espaces de verdure, de jeux, de lecture, de travail artisanal, de promenade ; de faire du domaine un parc public.</strong> </p>
<p>Dans cette entreprise, notre premier ennemi est le climat. La sécheresse dure désormais 6 à 8 mois, parfois successifs. Auparavant, la région connaissait deux saisons sèches et deux saisons pluvieuses (à chaque fois une petite et une grande). Quand vient la grande saison sèche, très peu de plants survivent et les hommes, qui n’ont déjà pas assez d’eau à boire, s’étonnent qu’on imagine en donner aux plantes. <br/>Le village possède plusieurs forages, un château d’eau et un réseau d’adduction d’eau plutôt original. Les populations ont donc accès à l’eau potable, soit par l’accès direct au réseau par abonnement, soit par achat d’eau chez des abonnés qui en vendent, soit directement au forage…</p>
<p>De novembre 2012 à mars 2013, il n’a pas eu pluie au village. Pour couronner le tout, les pompes sont tombées en panne en décembre-janvier 2012/2013 ; et la population n’avait accès à l’eau que très difficilement. De longues files d’attente se formaient auprès des puits de forage pour avoir un peu d’eau. Dans ces conditions, les plantes étaient menacées de mourir. Pire, les chasseurs de rongeurs ont fait un feu de brousse qui a dévoré une partie de nos jeunes pousses mises en terre tout au long du périmètre.</p>
<p>De juin 2013 à ce jour, nous sommes normalement en saison pluvieuse. Les pluies sont rares. Les pompes sont tombées en panne les unes après les autres et le village est dans l'impasse pour trouver de l'eau à boire... Sans interlocuteur et sans secours.</p>

</ul></span></span></span></span></div>","Soclogbo est un petit village au centre du Bénin niché au milieu des collines. Il compte environ 5000 habitants. Soclogbo dispose des infrastructures suivantes : un centre de santé, un centre social, un jardin d’enfants, trois écoles primaires, un collège (qui accueille les élèves de 6è en terminales), un château d’eau et un réseau de distribution d’eau potable…

À Soclogbo, les arbres centenaires comme le baobab, le Néré et l’iroko sont en symbiose avec le paysage accidenté des collines et des vallées …. La vie de ce village s’organise autour de l’agriculture, de la vente des produits issus du travail de la terre ainsi que d’une grande production de bois, – pour la confection des charpentes, la réalisation de meubles et la création d’objets d’art grâce à la sculpture – et de charbon de bois.
Pourtant, une ombre au tableau menace l’écosystème : l’avancée du désert. Additionnée à la surexploitation des ressources, l’absence d’une politique pérenne de reboisement, la situation empire lentement. Des essences séculaires sont attaquées, détruites et brûlées pour satisfaire la demande pressante des grandes villes. Grâce à cette surexploitation de la forêt, certains gagnent l’illusion du pain quotidien et mettent en péril l’avenir de la région. Ce cercle vicieux hypothèque l’avenir des jeunes et des enfants, qui demain vivront dans une région toujours plus sèche et toujours plus aride.
 
Née en avril 2010, l’association Mémoire de Clair de Lune est active dans le domaine de l’environnement, de la culture et du sport. Elle est mue par la volonté de préserver l’authenticité de ce village en menant différentes actions sur le terrain :

la sensibilisation des populations locales à l’impérieuse nécessité de reboiser et d’assainir l’environnement ;
les campagnes de reboisement, notamment la campagne 2013
l’action culturelle notamment autour du livre de jeunesse ;
la protection de l’environnement par la création d’un parc, jardin ou square.

Les membres de l’Association Mémoire de Clair de Lune s’investissent personnellement dans ces missions. Ils organisent entre autres activités, le Marathon Maxhili, la semaine du livre de jeunesse, la campagne permanente de reboisement et d’embellissement qui connaît un pic à la saison pluvieuse.

Dans son volet environnement, l’association veut aider à la prise de conscience et montrer par l’exemple qu’il est possible de changer le cours des événements. L’association a fait le pari de reverdir le village et les tentatives de reboisement sont nombreuses. Les activités menées sur le terrain montrent que les habitants accueillent favorablement les idées nouvelles et font preuve de bonne volonté. Les plants sont souvent spontanément accueillis et mis en terre.
Par ailleurs, un terrain de 2 hectares est à la disposition de l’Association afin qu’elle l’exploite au service du village. Plusieurs essences du milieu s’y trouvent naturellement. Le but du présent projet est de délimiter des espaces de verdure, de jeux, de lecture, de travail artisanal, de promenade ; de faire du domaine un parc public. 
Dans cette entreprise, notre premier ennemi est le climat. La sécheresse dure désormais 6 à 8 mois, parfois successifs. Auparavant, la région connaissait deux saisons sèches et deux saisons pluvieuses (à chaque fois une petite et une grande). Quand vient la grande saison sèche, très peu de plants survivent et les hommes, qui n’ont déjà pas assez d’eau à boire, s’étonnent qu’on imagine en donner aux plantes. Le village possède plusieurs forages, un château d’eau et un réseau d’adduction d’eau plutôt original. Les populations ont donc accès à l’eau potable, soit par l’accès direct au réseau par abonnement, soit par achat d’eau chez des abonnés qui en vendent, soit directement au forage…
De novembre 2012 à mars 2013, il n’a pas eu pluie au village. Pour couronner le tout, les pompes sont tombées en panne en décembre-janvier 2012/2013 ; et la population n’avait accès à l’eau que très difficilement. De longues files d’attente se formaient auprès des puits de forage pour avoir un peu d’eau. Dans ces conditions, les plantes étaient menacées de mourir. Pire, les chasseurs de rongeurs ont fait un feu de brousse qui a dévoré une partie de nos jeunes pousses mises en terre tout au long du périmètre.
De juin 2013 à ce jour, nous sommes normalement en saison pluvieuse. Les pluies sont rares. Les pompes sont tombées en panne les unes après les autres et le village est dans l'impasse pour trouver de l'eau à boire... Sans interlocuteur et sans secours.
 

L’Association a du mal à maintenir sa pépinière et à créer cet espace vert protégé. Dans son programme d’activités pour l’année 2013, elle a accueilli en stage un étudiant en Master de l’environnement de l'université Bordeaux I qui a rejoint l’Association en Juillet 2013 pour apporter sa contribution au projet.

<h3><span>So Show Me the Goods</span></h3>
<p>Our first product is this totally awesomesauce t-shirt featuring GX-47, the 7-Time Multitask Champion. Once produced, 20% of retail sales from this shirt will go to victims of toxic pollution in Ecuador and will come packaged in a neat Do-Gooder Oil can that you can reuse for other stuff.  100% cotton, XS - XL.</p>

<p>Dr. Jonathan Lundgren is an award winning scientist who studies entomology and agroecology. His work assesses the risks of pesticides
to friendly species, and figures out how to use biodiversity (plants, animals,
insects, microbes, etc.) to produce healthier food more profitably. His family
and friends have helped him to establish an enthusiastic network of stakeholders around the
country.  </p>
<p>Jenna Lundgren has a BS in Biology, expertise in business administration and community development, and a passionate belief that
we must change the course of agricultural food production <b>NOW</b>.  She often says her children (and future grandchildren) are her motivation for getting this revolution started.</p>
<p>Together with family, friends, laboratory team, and colleagues,
we are setting out to change how food is produced by redesigning farms in
nature’s image.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The problem that Blue Dasher Farm will tackle.</b></p>
<p>The planet faces numerous challenges: climate change, invasive species, pollution, human health, and simplification of entire landscapes. Management of agroecosystems is central to solving many of these problems.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Why should you care? </b></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Decisions made on farms affect you, your family, and our way of life.</b></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">It all seems so big. But we at Blue Dasher are going to use our talents (and they are considerable!) to help turn this ship around.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What is Blue Dasher Farm trying to do?</b><br/></p><p>To solve the many problems the planet is facing, we need a
transformational shift in how we produce food and manage agroecosystems.
These types of changes seldom come from the government or universities.
Paradigm shifts start from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Over many years of visiting agricultural operations across the country,
we quickly realized that there are some amazing farmers, ranchers, and bee
keepers that are leading the charge. They are integrating livestock, annual,
and perennial crops into multifaceted systems. They forgo monocultures,
tillage, and bare soil. They generate multiple revenue streams within their
operations, turning a profit while rebuilding soil and increasing diversity. Sadly, they are currently doing it with little scientific support. </p>
<p>Blue Dasher Farm’s role is to take what these innovators are
doing and use research, education, and demonstration to disseminate the
information to the next generation of scientists and food producers.</p>
<p>Our credibility, transparency, leadership, and vision make Blue
Dasher Farm completely unique from anything else out there. </p>

<p><b><i>    Helping to solve the honey bee problem.</i></b> Humans cannot survive
without pollinators, and honey production provides an additional revenue stream
to farms and rangeland. We would like to develop biological controls for
Varroa mite to reduce costly inputs and improve hive health, evaluate risks associated with pesticides to honey bees, and devise safe strategies
for deploying bee forage within agroecosystems.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czdx7cjE2UY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bee Health Research at Blue Dasher Farm</a><br/></p>
<p><b><i>    Improving diversity on rangeland.</i> </b>Rangeland occupies a
tremendous footprint on North America.  We can use this habitat to foster
biodiversity, reduce the impact of human activities on the environment, and produce
healthy food. Projects investigating the importance of dung fauna on pasture
health and the economics of cattle production, and how mob grazing systems can
improve systems-level processes on rangeland are at the top of our research list.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_bAoM5hjN4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rangeland Research at Blue Dasher Farm</a><br/></p>
<p><b><i>    Soil health and crop production.</i></b> Many problems are associated
with annual and perennial cropland. But management can
improve this situation dramatically and profitably. Reducing disturbance like
tillage and unnecessary pesticide use, and increasing diversity through the use
of diverse crop rotations, intercropping (taking advantage of plant
synergisms), and cover cropping (instead of leaving bare ground) are key
research areas we want to explore. And figuring out how to maximize insect services like
predation, weed herbivory, soil physical and chemical properties, and
pollination will be a primary focus of research.</p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=977RLywKf5A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cropland Biodiversity Research @ Blue Dasher Farm</a><br/></p>

Dakota. But we really need your help in order to take this farm and make it a place where research, education, and demonstration can thrive. Once the core location is established and staffed, it is our vision to establish
a network of these research, education, demonstration farms across the country
to address local and regional needs. As more and more farmers become ready to

Blue Dasher Farm Website


Blue Dasher Farm will be the first of a network of research, education, and demonstration farms to bring SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT to biodiverse food production.
Who are we?We are scientists, farmers, bee keepers, and livestock producers who are embarking on an initiative that is going to make this planet a whole lot better. 

Dr. Jonathan Lundgren is an award winning scientist who studies entomology and agroecology. His work assesses the risks of pesticides
to friendly species, and figures out how to use biodiversity (plants, animals,
insects, microbes, etc.) to produce healthier food more profitably. His family
and friends have helped him to establish an enthusiastic network of stakeholders around the
country.  
Jenna Lundgren has a BS in Biology, expertise in business administration and community development, and a passionate belief that
we must change the course of agricultural food production NOW.  She often says her children (and future grandchildren) are her motivation for getting this revolution started.
Together with family, friends, laboratory team, and colleagues,
we are setting out to change how food is produced by redesigning farms in
nature’s image.
The problem that Blue Dasher Farm will tackle.
The planet faces numerous challenges: climate change, invasive species, pollution, human health, and simplification of entire landscapes. Management of agroecosystems is central to solving many of these problems.Why should you care? Decisions made on farms affect you, your family, and our way of life.It all seems so big. But we at Blue Dasher are going to use our talents (and they are considerable!) to help turn this ship around.What is Blue Dasher Farm trying to do?To solve the many problems the planet is facing, we need a
transformational shift in how we produce food and manage agroecosystems.
These types of changes seldom come from the government or universities.
Paradigm shifts start from the bottom up.
Over many years of visiting agricultural operations across the country,
we quickly realized that there are some amazing farmers, ranchers, and bee
keepers that are leading the charge. They are integrating livestock, annual,
and perennial crops into multifaceted systems. They forgo monocultures,
tillage, and bare soil. They generate multiple revenue streams within their
operations, turning a profit while rebuilding soil and increasing diversity. Sadly, they are currently doing it with little scientific support. 
Blue Dasher Farm’s role is to take what these innovators are
doing and use research, education, and demonstration to disseminate the
information to the next generation of scientists and food producers.
Our credibility, transparency, leadership, and vision make Blue
Dasher Farm completely unique from anything else out there. 
Initial Projects
    Helping to solve the honey bee problem. Humans cannot survive
without pollinators, and honey production provides an additional revenue stream
to farms and rangeland. We would like to develop biological controls for
Varroa mite to reduce costly inputs and improve hive health, evaluate risks associated with pesticides to honey bees, and devise safe strategies
for deploying bee forage within agroecosystems.Bee Health Research at Blue Dasher Farm
    Improving diversity on rangeland. Rangeland occupies a
tremendous footprint on North America.  We can use this habitat to foster
biodiversity, reduce the impact of human activities on the environment, and produce
healthy food. Projects investigating the importance of dung fauna on pasture
health and the economics of cattle production, and how mob grazing systems can
improve systems-level processes on rangeland are at the top of our research list.Rangeland Research at Blue Dasher Farm
    Soil health and crop production. Many problems are associated
with annual and perennial cropland. But management can
improve this situation dramatically and profitably. Reducing disturbance like
tillage and unnecessary pesticide use, and increasing diversity through the use
of diverse crop rotations, intercropping (taking advantage of plant
synergisms), and cover cropping (instead of leaving bare ground) are key
research areas we want to explore. And figuring out how to maximize insect services like
predation, weed herbivory, soil physical and chemical properties, and
pollination will be a primary focus of research.Cropland Biodiversity Research @ Blue Dasher Farm
Our Vision for the Future
The Deuel County location is just the beginning. We have a purchase
agreement on a 53 acre farm with  facilities that will work for hosting courses and conducting laboratory research that is located right off of the I-29 corridor in eastern South
Dakota. But we really need your help in order to take this farm and make it a place where research, education, and demonstration can thrive. Once the core location is established and staffed, it is our vision to establish
a network of these research, education, demonstration farms across the country
to address local and regional needs. As more and more farmers become ready to
make the change to biodiverse farming, we want to have systems and strategies
in place to remove informational gaps and lessen risks to their transition.Where are your contributions going?

is an ambitious and unique project. A property has been purchased south of the
Daintree River in Far North Queensland, backing onto the World Heritage listed
Daintree National Park: an area recognised as having the highest biodiversity
rate in Australia. This 37 acre (15ha) site will encompass a small area for low impact, ecologically sustainable Visitor, Education
and Interpretive Centre, and Bat Hospital. We envisage to also build a café and
gift shop in the future once the revegetation is established. The majority of
the land is being turned over to the exciting task of turning old cane farm into complex lowland rainforest, combined with forest walks for a stunning
and authentic ecotourism experience. The site already contains mature and new
rainforest planting, and transects have revealed a myriad of fauna, including
11 EVNT (Endangered, Vulnerable, &amp; Near Threatened) listed species. Government transects have revealed at least 65 additional species of Mammals, Birds, Reptiles and Amphibians on this property.</p>
<p>This

Rufous Owl, Ghost bat, Large-eared Horseshoe bat, the endangered Australian
Lace-lid Frog, Spectacled Flying-fox and flora such as the vulnerably listed Black
Palm.</p>
<p>Divided
into planting stages over 6 years, the whole project will require over 70,000
trees to be planted. This will provide a fast-growing framework for animals to
plant secondary seed direct from the surrounding forest. The first stage of 5.4
acres (2.2ha) (encompassing the visually-blended centre) will create a
significant 60 metre wide corridor linking mature lowland rainforest to the
mangroves at the Daintree River mouth for the first time in around 100 years.</p>
<p>Working

Ποιοι είμαστε
Who we are
Το B2Green.gr διανύει ήδη το δεύτερο του έτος. Έπειτα από αρκετά χρόνια ενασχόλησης με το χώρο, αποφασίσαμε να ακολουθήσουμε το όραμα μας για ένα καλύτερο αύριο: να δημιουργήσουμε μια διαδικτυακή πλατφόρμα, με σκοπό την προώθηση των πράσινων τεχνολογιών.
Στόχος μας ήταν και παραμένει η δημιουργία ενός online σημείου αναφοράς για όλους εσάς: τους ενδιαφερόμενους και μη ειδικούς, τους φοιτητές, τους επαγγελματίες, αλλά και τους φορείς, τα ιδρύματα και τους επιστήμονες του χώρου.
Οι βασικοί άξονες που ακολουθήσαμε κατά το ξεκίνημα μας, ήταν:

η φιλοξενία σχετικών άρθρων, δικών μας αλλά και αναδημοσιεύσεων
η δημιουργία επαγγελματικού καταλόγου (ήδη συμπεριλαμβάνονται περισσότεροι από 800 επαγγελματίες του χώρου)
η ανάπτυξη online εφαρμογής μέσω της οποίας συνδέονται μεταξύ τους οι επισκέπτες της σελίδας με τους εγγεγραμμένους επαγγελματίες χωρίς καμία χρέωση
η δημιουργία newsletter το οποίο μετά από μικρό χρονικό διάστημα έγινε καθημερινό (B2Green.gr Daily Report).
B2Green.gr is already in its second year. After several years of involvement in the field, we decided to follow our vision for a better future and create an online platform, dedicated to green technologies.
Our goal was and remains to create an integrated online platform for everyone: specialists or not, professionals, college & university students, and of course, green technology scientists & institutions.
The main axes that we followed so far were:

hosting related articles
creating a professional directory (already includes more than 800 professionals)
developing an online RFQ service, through which we provide our visitors the opportunity to connect with subscribed professionals without any charge
creating a daily newsletter (B2Green.gr Daily Report).

Η ανταπόκριση σας ήταν πέρα από κάθε προσδοκία! Μέσα σε ένα μόλις έτος, καταφέραμε να καθιερωθούμε στις κορυφαίες θέσεις των ιστοσελίδων του χώρου στην Ελλάδα!
Επιπλέον, στο μικρό αυτό χρονικό διάστημα, είχαμε ενεργή συμμετοχή ως εκθέτες και χορηγοί επικοινωνίας σε περισσότερες από 10 εκθέσεις και συνέδρια του χώρου, όπου μας δόθηκε η δυνατότητα να έρθουμε σε επαφή με εσάς, τους αναγνώστες μας, να γνωριστούμε από κοντά, να ανταλλάξουμε ιδέες και απόψεις για το χώρο μας και να καταγράψουμε τις δικές σας προτάσεις, επιθυμίες και ανάγκες, με σκοπό να τις ενσωματώσουμε στα επόμενα μας βήματα.
Your response was far beyond our expectations! Within just one year, we managed to establish B2Green.gr between the top Greek websites with related content.
Moreover, in this short time, we had active participation as exhibitors and media partners in more than 10 related exhibitions and conferences, where we had the chance to get in touch with you – our readers, to exchange ideas and opinions for our common interests and to write down your suggestions, wishes and needs, in order to integrate them within our next steps.

Το περιεχόμενο του B2Green.gr όπως γνωρίζετε ήδη, παρέχεται δωρεάν, και έτσι θα συνεχίσει. Για να προχωρήσουμε όμως στην υλοποίηση του B2Green-pedia, χρειαζόμαστε την ενίσχυση σας. Το ποσό που απαιτείται για την υλοποίηση του – σε πλήρη ανάπτυξη – είναι σημαντικά μεγαλύτερο του στόχου που θέσαμε στο indiegogo. Το project θα υλοποιηθεί έτσι κι αλλιώς, ανεξαρτήτως επίτευξης του στόχου – η συνεισφορά σας όμως θα μας βοηθήσει για να το ολοκληρώσουμε ταχύτερα και πληρέστερα.
Τα ανταλλάγματα που σας προσφέρουμε για τη συνεισφορά σας όπως μπορείτε να δείτε, είναι μοναδικά, μιας και έχουν σχέση με την υπάρχουσα επιτυχημένη σελίδα μας, B2Green.gr. Μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε με ποσά που ξεκινούν από μόλις 10 ευρώ, ενώ μπορείτε να επιλέξετε ανταλλάγματα που σας ενδιαφέρουν, είτε είσαστε επαγγελματίες του χώρου, είτε φοιτητές, είτε ακόμα και αν απλά ενδιαφέρεστε για τις πράσινες τεχνολογίες και το περιβάλλον.
The implementation of B2Green-pedia is in our mind since B2Green.gr's day one! Unfortunately, the amount required for the completion of this new project exceeds our financial capabilities.
Until today, we have been relying on our own strength, without having received any government grant or third parties funding.
As you know, economic downturn - without being the only fault - hits crucially promotional and advertising services, which are our only income. Our only option to cover just a part of the cost, is to reach out to those who have supported us from the very beginning with their acceptance: you!
The content of B2Green.gr as you already know, is totally free, and so it will be in the future. In order to develop B2Green-pedia, we need your aid. The amount needed to implement - in full growth - is significantly higher than the target we set at indiegogo. The project will be regardless of achieving our target - but your contribution will help us to make it better and finish sooner.
The rewards we offer for your contribution, as you can see, are unique, since they are related to our successful existing website B2Green.gr. You can contribute with amounts starting from just € 10 and you can choose rewards that interest you, whether you are professional, student, or even if you are just interested in green and environmental technologies.
Που θα χρησιμοποιηθούν τα χρήματα
Where the money will be used
Το B2Green-pedia δε χρειάζεται πόρους μόνο για την ολοκλήρωση του αλλά και για τη διαρκή του ενημέρωση, τροφοδότηση με ότι νεότερο εμφανίζεται στο χώρο, συντήρηση κλπ.
Τα χρήματα που θα συγκεντρωθούν θα χρησιμοποιηθούν για:

υλικοτεχνικό εξοπλισμό (Η/Υ, αναβάθμιση servers κλπ)
πρόσληψη επιπλέον προσωπικού (αυτό και μόνο αξίζει της στήριξης σας)
κόστος προγραμματισμού και δημιουργίας της νέας πλατφόρμας
κόστος γραφιστικού υλικού και δημιουργικού
κόστος πνευματικών δικαιωμάτων
κόστος προώθησης και προβολής του B2Green-pedia
κόστος διατήρησης και συνεχούς – καθημερινής ενημέρωσης
κόστη μετάφρασης
φορολογικά έξοδα
B2Green-pedia needs funding, in order not only to complete but also to keep it up to date, cover maintenance expenses etc.
The money raised will be used to:

technical equipment (pc network, server upgrade etc. )
hiring additional staff (if only this one deserves your support )
development cost
graphic designer cost
copyright cost
B2Green-pedia's promotional cost
maintenance and daily updating cost
translation cost
tax expenditures

<h2>THE PROBLEM: A DEVASTATING FOREST FIRE</h2>
<h3>On the 18th of August 2012, a small fire started in the mountains near the centre of Chios.  The fierce northerly winds blowing that night whipped the flames into an inferno that raged out of control for six days.  By the time it was finally extinguished, the fire had destroyed 36,000 acres of forest and farmland.   Many hundreds of the island's unique mastic bushes were lost, along with scrubland, olive groves, vineyards, crops, farm animals and wildlife.  In all, about one-fifth of the island turned to ash.  The scenes in our video were shot while the fire was still burning and in the days immediately following. Luckily, nobody was killed, but thousands of dead pine trees now stand like grey guardians of the blackened slopes. </h3>
<h2>WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT: TOGETHER WE WILL TURN THOSE SLOPES GREEN AGAIN</h2>

<h3>Here's how...</h3>
<h3>Since the fire, Chios Nature has received many messages from people that love the island asking what they can do to support restoration work.  We were already investigating opportunities.  Since we have very little money ourselves, and neither equipment nor personnel, it initially appeared we might be powerless to help.  But thankfully, there are...</h3>

This means the team is constantly struggling to work at its full potential.  One of the greatest challenges it faces is in the transportation of its people and gear.</h3>

<h2>GETTING A VAN TO A MAN THAT CAN</h2>
<h3>At CHIOS NATURE we believe in reinforcing success.  We also think that we should not try to reinvent the wheel.  So we're not setting up yet another new group to do reafforestation work - we already know ""a man that can""  (and lots of women too).  And WITH YOUR SUPPORT we are going to help them do it even more effectively.  Here's the plan:</h3>
<h2>WE GIVE THEM THE TOOLS...</h2>
<h2>                                ... AND THEY GET THE JOB DONE</h2>
<h3>The group's volunteers will use the new van this campaign will provide, to transport what they need, to where they need it:  tools &amp; equipment, personnel, seedlings, even a tank full of water will be able to be delivered to any location on the island that can be reached by road.  The people of OMIKRON will be our hands on the ground, greening the hillsides again.</h3>
<h3>Under the guidance of the Forestry Service, OMIKRON have already collected seeds that they will be planting this Spring to produce the saplings that, in a year or two, they will use to create new plantations of pines and other native species. Once the volunteers have planted the young trees, they will protect them (by fencing) from grazing herds, water and care for them until they become established.</h3>
<h3>In the meantime, they are pruning and clearing dry undergrowth from surviving forests, to stop future fires from being able to spread quickly, and supporting the work that has already begun to prevent the soil erosion that so often follows an intense fire. </h3>
<h3>In a natural process that may seem less dramatic than the fire itself, but is no less damaging, precious soil gets washed down into the sea when it rains, carrying with it vital nutrients and any viable seeds that might have survived the flames.  </h3>

<h2>THE WAY FORWARD</h2>
<h3>OMIKRON have identified a number of pre-owned vans that would suit their needs.  The amount (16,500 euro) we are aiming to collect, will cover the cost of buying one of these on the Greek mainland and transporting it by ferry to Chios.</h3>
<h3>CHIOS NATURE is acting as coordinator of this effort, but none of the funds you pledge will be retained by us - they will all be channelled to TEAM OMIKRON. </h3>
<h3>If there is any money left over from the purchase of the van, we will use it to buy as much additional equipment as we can.  That means things like: chain saws, gloves, protective work gear etc. and give that to the volunteers as well. (They'll even have something to carry it all around in)!</h3>
<h3>For the lovely people that decide to pledge funds to this project we have put together a range of ""goodies"" that we will send you, according to the level of your contribution.  If you have chosen a ""perk"" make sure we also have a postal address for you!</h3>

OMIKRON have identified a number of pre-owned vans that would suit their needs.  The amount (16,500 euro) we are aiming to collect, will cover the cost of buying one of these on the Greek mainland and transporting it by ferry to Chios.
CHIOS NATURE is acting as coordinator of this effort, but none of the funds you pledge will be retained by us - they will all be channelled to TEAM OMIKRON. 
If there is any money left over from the purchase of the van, we will use it to buy as much additional equipment as we can.  That means things like: chain saws, gloves, protective work gear etc. and give that to the volunteers as well. (They'll even have something to carry it all around in)!
For the lovely people that decide to pledge funds to this project we have put together a range of ""goodies"" that we will send you, according to the level of your contribution.  If you have chosen a ""perk"" make sure we also have a postal address for you!


We also plan to make a short film about the work of OMIKRON, so that you will be able to see not only the mighty van itself in action, but also the many facets of the work that the team does to protect and restore the landscapes of Chios.  We have started collecting footage for this, even though the van has not yet been bought.
FINALLY... A GREAT, BIG

and Climatecaring to offer an amazing prize as our fund raising campaign
reaches its climax. 

</p><p>We have
raised 52% of our target as of 14/05/2014 with a huge boast from <a href=""http://www.utilita.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Utilita</a>, a UK energy company
that has donated £10K. The cash will take some time to organise through the corporate
channels so will not show on the Indiegogo total. We hope to get closer to our
target by offering this unique incentive.</p>

There are on
average 12 hours of sunshine a day in the Seychelles Islands. We want you to
donate £1 for every hour. For your £12 donation we will send you a postcard

survive in a world where fish stocks are diminishing through over exploitation
and a fickle tourist industry has been hit by one of the worst financial crises on
record. </p>
<p>We need to replace the diesel powered generator on Cousin
Island with a Photovoltaic Solar Power system. This will bring multiple benefits:
Save approximately £600 a month, this money will used to fund continuing research,
extra staffing, island maintenance, boat repairs, energy security and much more. It will also
save around 8,000kg’s of CO² emissions annually. This will finally bring the Island
back to as near a pristine natural habitat as possible fulfilling the dream of

Island is a granitic island covering 27 hectares and lies approximately 2km
from Praslin Island. It became the world’s first internationally owned-reserve
when it was purchased in 1968 by the International Council for the Protection
of Birds (ICBP), now Birdlife International. The objective was to save the last
remaining population of the Seychelles warblers and return the Island to its original natural state. Warbler numbers
had dropped to 28 individuals at that time and their extinction looked imminent. The rescue mission has proved so successful
that these endearing little song birds have now been reintroduced to other
Islands. Their population now stands at 2500 and is growing annually.


</p><p>As part of the Islands rehabilitation process it was made
rat and cat free making one of the few rat free Islands in the Seychelles and a
safe haven for breading birds.</p>

</p><p>First
made into a Nature Reserve in 1968 it was afforded further protection when it
was designated a Special Reserve in 1974. It is not only significant for sea
birds and endemic land birds but is also the most important breeding site for
Hawksbill turtles in the Western Indian Ocean. The reserve is managed by “Nature
Seychelles” a local, well known and respected NGO. The Island is run solely by
local staff and benefits local communities on the neighbouring Praslin Island
through eco-tourism.</p>

<p>This charismatic bird, originally found in great numbers on
several islands, was in 1990 down to a population of only 23 birds on Frégate Island,
making it one of the most critically endangered species in the world. In 1990,
a special recovery programme was established by Nature Seychelles, leading to
the eventual translocation of several birds to Cousin, Cousine, and Aride
islands. In 1999 the total population had increased to 90 birds, 25 of them on
Cousin, and today, there are about 250 scattered over various islands. The species has been
removed from the critically endangered list but still remains endangered. </p><p>Other inhabitants.</p><p>The
island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds of seven species. A large colony,
dominated by Lesser Noddie but including about 1300 pairs of Brown Noddies, is
present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the
north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of Wedge tailed shearwaters. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/425983/files/20140311061745-_L3A0192.jpg?1394543865"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Year-round
breeders include White Fairy and Brindled terns, White tailed tropic birds and
some 1000–1,500 pairs of Audubon’s Shearwaters. Several hundred Great and
Lesser Frigate birds use the island for roosting and can be seen soaring over
it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the Ruddy Turnstone.
Common Moorhens and Striated Herons also breed on the island. <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FD0TSh6gPqGY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DD0TSh6gPqGY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FD0TSh6gPqGY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h2>Climatecaring.org: Reason to be.<br/>
</h2><p>
</p><p>Tim Kirkpatrick studied off grid PV design and installation
extensively when studying for an MSc in renewable energy. As an ardent
conservationist who had been <a href=""http://www.gvi.co.uk/programs/marine-conservation-seychelles-expedition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GVI Seychelles</a> country director for eight years he
had a plan to start a movement that would assist conservation whilst mitigating
against climate change and save large amounts of money at the same time.</p>
<p>To this end Climatecaring.org was born. It's Mission statement:  Save 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually
through the intelligent deployment of renewable energy systems. To do this
using sound economic practices and education strategies that save significant
amounts of money compared to a business as usual approach. In doing so kick
start 100 like minded institutions annually to do the same, thereby saving 1
million tons of climate changing emissions. It is my sincere hope that, perhaps
through this initiative, we as custodians of this beautiful planet may ensure
its continued good health and harmony that is intrinsically linked to ours. The effects of man made climate change are destabalizing the earths 
abilty to regulate its complex life support systems that have been in 
perfect balance for thousands of years.</p><p> Below is a short extract from

stage waiting for funding. We have calculated a rough power load profile which dictates the size of the system
needed to cover the entire daily output of the existing 5.5 Kva generator. Based on these calculations we have
estimated the Island will need a 6 Kw system with a battery bank size of approximately
20 Kilowatt hours (Kwh). The Curieuse PV system is 2 Kw therefore the Cousin system
will need to be 3 times larger. Giving us an estimated total cost of £25,000,
Taking into account the extra transport cost and inflation.<br/></p><h2>Our Rewards.<br/>

Island Indiegogo appeal!
Global
Vision International (GVI) has teamed up with Nature Seychelles
and Climatecaring to offer an amazing prize as our fund raising campaign
reaches its climax. 

We have
raised 52% of our target as of 14/05/2014 with a huge boast from Utilita, a UK energy company
that has donated £10K. The cash will take some time to organise through the corporate
channels so will not show on the Indiegogo total. We hope to get closer to our
target by offering this unique incentive.

There are on
average 12 hours of sunshine a day in the Seychelles Islands. We want you to
donate £1 for every hour. For your £12 donation we will send you a postcard
from paradise and our eternal gratitude, Plus you will be
entered into a prize draw to win a FREE four week conservation expedition on Curieuse Island, a sister Island of Cousin,
worth £1,495. The expedition is operated by GVI, the world's
foremost volunteering organisation and keen supporter of our work in the
Seychelles. 

Climatecaring
will assist the lucky winner to set up a crowd funding page to raise the funds
for an air ticket and donate the first £100 or equivalent currency to the site. Click here for full details.


Our Campaign.This fund raising Campaign is being initiated by Nature Seychelles in partnership with Climatecaring.org and backed by Birdlife International. Small Island devolping states (SIDS) are at the the forfront of climate change. Rising sea levels and disturbance of natural weather
patterns are already causing catastrophic changes to their very existence. Small
economies reliant on tourism and fisheries are finding it increasingly hard to
survive in a world where fish stocks are diminishing through over exploitation
and a fickle tourist industry has been hit by one of the worst financial crises on
record. 
We need to replace the diesel powered generator on Cousin
Island with a Photovoltaic Solar Power system. This will bring multiple benefits:
Save approximately £600 a month, this money will used to fund continuing research,
extra staffing, island maintenance, boat repairs, energy security and much more. It will also
save around 8,000kg’s of CO² emissions annually. This will finally bring the Island
back to as near a pristine natural habitat as possible fulfilling the dream of
Dr Nirmal Shah (CEO, Nature Seychelles) and Dr Marco Lambertini (CEO, Birdlife
international).Quote from Dr Rolph Payet (Seychelles Minister for Enviroment and Energy).As individuals we can do something about climate change and this is your
chance to make a difference, all be it small. If we can succeed in this project and
do many more, thereby influencing and teaching as we go it can be a BIG
difference and help in the fight to keep climate change in check.
BirdLife international is a
global partnership of conservation organisations that strives to conserve
birds, their habitats and global biodiversity, working with people towards
sustainability in the use of natural resources. It is the World's largest
partnership of conservation organisations, with over 120 partner organisations.
Together the Birdlife partnership forms the leading authority on the status of
birds, their habitats and the issues and problems affecting bird life.Cousin Island, Seychelles.

Cousin
Island is a granitic island covering 27 hectares and lies approximately 2km
from Praslin Island. It became the world’s first internationally owned-reserve
when it was purchased in 1968 by the International Council for the Protection
of Birds (ICBP), now Birdlife International. The objective was to save the last
remaining population of the Seychelles warblers and return the Island to its original natural state. Warbler numbers
had dropped to 28 individuals at that time and their extinction looked imminent. The rescue mission has proved so successful
that these endearing little song birds have now been reintroduced to other
Islands. Their population now stands at 2500 and is growing annually.


As part of the Islands rehabilitation process it was made
rat and cat free making one of the few rat free Islands in the Seychelles and a
safe haven for breading birds.
Seychelles Warbler.
First
made into a Nature Reserve in 1968 it was afforded further protection when it
was designated a Special Reserve in 1974. It is not only significant for sea
birds and endemic land birds but is also the most important breeding site for
Hawksbill turtles in the Western Indian Ocean. The reserve is managed by “Nature
Seychelles” a local, well known and respected NGO. The Island is run solely by
local staff and benefits local communities on the neighbouring Praslin Island
through eco-tourism.
Hawksbill Turtle.
Magpie Robin recovery program:
Another remarkable success story in the fight against species extinctions through manmade
habitat change and disturbance’s.Seychelles Magpie Robin.
This charismatic bird, originally found in great numbers on
several islands, was in 1990 down to a population of only 23 birds on Frégate Island,
making it one of the most critically endangered species in the world. In 1990,
a special recovery programme was established by Nature Seychelles, leading to
the eventual translocation of several birds to Cousin, Cousine, and Aride
islands. In 1999 the total population had increased to 90 birds, 25 of them on
Cousin, and today, there are about 250 scattered over various islands. The species has been
removed from the critically endangered list but still remains endangered. Other inhabitants.The
island hosts over 300,000 nesting seabirds of seven species. A large colony,
dominated by Lesser Noddie but including about 1300 pairs of Brown Noddies, is
present from May to September during the south-east monsoon. During the
north-west monsoon, the hill supports a breeding colony of Wedge tailed shearwaters. Year-round
breeders include White Fairy and Brindled terns, White tailed tropic birds and
some 1000–1,500 pairs of Audubon’s Shearwaters. Several hundred Great and
Lesser Frigate birds use the island for roosting and can be seen soaring over
it. Some waders are present throughout the year, the commonest being the Ruddy Turnstone.
Common Moorhens and Striated Herons also breed on the island. Climatecaring.org: Reason to be.

Tim Kirkpatrick studied off grid PV design and installation
extensively when studying for an MSc in renewable energy. As an ardent
conservationist who had been GVI Seychelles country director for eight years he
had a plan to start a movement that would assist conservation whilst mitigating
against climate change and save large amounts of money at the same time.
To this end Climatecaring.org was born. It's Mission statement:  Save 10,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually
through the intelligent deployment of renewable energy systems. To do this
using sound economic practices and education strategies that save significant
amounts of money compared to a business as usual approach. In doing so kick
start 100 like minded institutions annually to do the same, thereby saving 1
million tons of climate changing emissions. It is my sincere hope that, perhaps
through this initiative, we as custodians of this beautiful planet may ensure
its continued good health and harmony that is intrinsically linked to ours. The effects of man made climate change are destabalizing the earths 
abilty to regulate its complex life support systems that have been in 
perfect balance for thousands of years. Below is a short extract from 
the 2011 report from The United Nations  International Panel on Climate 
Change. Tim
will design and install the system on Cousin Island after this fund raising campaign has run its
course.How do we know PV sytems work well in Seychelles and what are the costs?

Tim designed and installed a PV stand alone system on the neighbouring
Island of Curieuse. It came online on December 20th 2013. It has worked flawlessly since then, totally
replacing the generator. The investment needed was £7217, this was paid back through
the saving of generator fuel and maintenance costs on the 1st of
March 2014.



The money being saved every month can be used to increase
are conservation activities on the island from now on. 
The
Island is now saving £516 a month. CO² and other green house gas emissions avoided are 7955 Kg’s annually.
Island peace and harmony; priceless. 

In fact with the modern,
reliable and cost effective renewable energy technology available today it does not make
any financial or environmental sense to
use generators for electrical energy production in the tropics.
Cousin PV standalone system.The PV system for Cousin Island is already at the design
stage waiting for funding. We have calculated a rough power load profile which dictates the size of the system
needed to cover the entire daily output of the existing 5.5 Kva generator. Based on these calculations we have
estimated the Island will need a 6 Kw system with a battery bank size of approximately
20 Kilowatt hours (Kwh). The Curieuse PV system is 2 Kw therefore the Cousin system
will need to be 3 times larger. Giving us an estimated total cost of £25,000,
Taking into account the extra transport cost and inflation.Our Rewards.
We want to thank you with
something special for donating towards our goal, so we have come up with unique
opportunities over five different levels of giving. There are a couple of
different ways to own specialy commissioned art works. The first is a series of
photographs by a talanted wildlife photographer, Maxime Aliaga. If you donate at the third
level, you can chose one picture featured in the video below by telling us the
ID number of the photo. At our fourth donation level you will receive two
pictures, with the option to receive up to 14 photos by donating an additional
£20 for each one.We have also commisioned an art work of Cousin Island life by a renowned
 local artist Michael Arnphie. A limited run of prints 
will be availible for slightly larger donations. Micheal has now finished the art works and they have been added to our perks. Below are the stunning peices of work he has completed for us.Cousin Island Study.
Detail examples.

Cousin Island, lesser Noddy Study.
The Cousin
Island Study will be a massive 8” x 20” fine art giclee on canvas print sent to
you in a protective tube. This 18Mb print appears almost three dimensional with
incredibly intricate detailing. It can be yours for a donation or £50. This
will be a strictly limited edition; each print will be numbered and signed by
the artist. Only 250 prints will ever be produced. 
The Cousin
Island, lesser Noddy Study will be an A4 fine art giclee
on canvas print with equally incredible attention to detail. It can be yours
for a donation of £40. Again this will be a strictly limited edition with each
print signed by the Artist and numbered. Only 250 will ever be printed.
This is a
once in a lifetime chance to own these artworks, and do a wonderful thing for a
little island in the Indian Ocean, please don’t let it slip by.

<h3>Hi! Welcome to the Indiegogo page for a project that's near and dear to me. Here's why.</h3>
<p>Three years ago I volunteered at the Itapoa Reserve, which is one of many organizations working toward protecting the Ecuadorian Choco. (The Choco runs all the way up into Colombia. There's a map in the video.) Raul, the owner of the Itapoa Reserve, is a biologist who has devoted his life to saving the Choco. I don't say this lightly: he moved to the Choco rainforest 20 years ago, and never left. Every single day, he works toward reforesting the vanishing jungle. And there are others like him, and other organizations like his. Their dedication is stunning.</p>
<p>The problem is, despite the efforts of men and women in Ecuador and abroad, <strong>approximately just .3% of the Ecuadorian Choco is under protection status</strong>. And if we consider the fact that the Choco we see today is just 5% of what it once was, that .3% becomes even more troubling.</p>
<h3>Why is the rate of deforestation so high?</h3>
<p>Lots of reasons. Among them: slash-and-burn agriculture, mining, logging, and monoculture crops. Of these crops, African palm oil plantations are the top contributor to the rainforest's disappearance. </p>
<h3>If deforestation continues at its current rate, the Choco could disappear entirely. So what can we do to stop it?</h3>
<p>Man. It seems like a huge task, doesn't it: saving the rainforest? It seems impossible. It seems like you'd have to be a biologist, or or a wide-eyed undergraduate environmentalist to even attempt it. </p>
<p>Well, first, I happen to be neither of those things. I'm a writer with a filmmaking hobby, who teaches playwriting, and walks dogs, and makes smoothies part-time for a living. I am very much not a biologist, and I've yet to chain myself to a tree - and still, I fully believe we can help save the rainforest. I spent three months volunteering toward the cause a few years ago, and this winter I'll return to help in a slightly different capacity. (More on that in a moment!)</p>
<p>Second, it <em>is</em> a huge task. But huge tasks are undertaken in small steps.</p>
<h3>Here's the plan.</h3>
<p>Three years ago, I not only had the pleasure of volunteering for Raul, but I also gained a pretty spectacular friend. I've kept in touch with other volunteers as well, even after we've all gone home, and I've watched some remarkable projects come to fruition. My friend Daniel funded a project to build a water pipe to allow a community access to clean water once again. Another volunteer made a book of photographs, the proceeds of which fund Itapoa's efforts. Raul has raised money to buy another tract of land in the Choco, in order to protect it from being deforested.</p>
<p>I've watched all this happen while living in New York, working on a graduate degree in Creative Writing and Literature. Now, with the end of classes in sight, I'm making my way back to the Itapoa Reserve.</p>
<h3>The plan is two-fold.</h3>
<p><strong>Fold number one.</strong></p>
<p>With your help, I'll be donating to Itapoa a <strong>brand-new laptop with editing software</strong> and a <strong>video camera</strong>. Why? Because Raul, his volunteers, and his neighbors are taking small steps to save the Choco. But if they could reach more people - potential volunteers, biologists, researchers, universities, even the Ministry of Environment! - and these people take <em>even more</em> small steps to save the Choco, the next thing you know, you've turned 10 small steps into 1,000. You've turned .3% of the protected forest into 30%.</p>
<p>Right now, Raul's publicity of his cause depends on photos that volunteers take with their digital and cell phone cameras. And he's managing. His <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Itapoa-Tropical-Rainforest-Reserve/161706220523717"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook page</a> is filled photos of endangered animals, and volunteers trekking through the forest, encountering thigh-high mud pits and monkeys. People want to help, and Raul's often got a few volunteers at a time devoting, as I did, a couple of weeks or months to the cause.</p>
<p>But let's imagine what he could do with video equipment. </p>
<p>In fact, I asked Raul to imagine what he might do with it, and he gave me one idea after the next. Here's an overview of a few of those ideas, so you get the gist of what a game-changer video could be for his cause.</p>
<ul>
<li>An educational video highlighting the Itapoa reserve. Featuring Raul, neighboring communities, international volunteers, and the Choco - where it thrives, and where it has been destroyed.</li>
<li>A video of the Choco's endangered birds. Aimed at birders, biologists, audobon societies, conservation organizations. </li>
<li>Video for crowdfunding sites (like this one!). Raul is currently working on a children's book to educated local and indigenous children. Raising literacy rates will prevent locals, many of whom are illiterate and therefore unaware of their rights, from being targeted by African palm companies that notoriously take advantage of these circumstances, and buy up locals' land for mere hundreds of dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each video, with its unique targeted audience, and in its own way, will <strong>educate, raise awareness, and call to action </strong>thousands of people who, today, remain unaware of the endangered Choco rainforest. </p>
<p><strong>Fold number two.</strong></p>
<p>Raul and I will make the first video on that list together. I'll get him acquainted with the camera, and give him instruction in basic editing. All interested volunteers and locals will participate as well, receiving training and lots of hands-on experience.</p>
<p>We'll spend about two months collecting footage and editing together a short film. By the time I leave, he'll be comfortable enough with the equipment that he can shoot his own video, like the ones described above, and, if he can help it, dozens more.</p>
<p><strong>And the video I'm shooting video is going to be really, really cool.</strong></p>
<p>My friend Will, an engineer, is donating a flying camera for the duration of my trip. That's right, a flying camera. It's a hero cam strapped onto a robot. And he'll be there to operate it.</p>
<p>We can get a bird's eye view of the deforested rainforest. We can get a bird's eye view of other birds' eyes. </p>
<p>And we'll be using the regular, non-flying camera too. We'll collect footage of the reserve, and interview locals and volunteers, and put together a neat, concise picture of Raul and the Itapoa Reserve. This video will be designed to attract volunteers. It will be featured on Raul's web site, which right now is quite basic. With this video, he can take fuller advantage of the traffic the Itapoa Reserve attracts from facebook, word of mouth, and even Lonely Planet. </p>
<h3>What I'm asking from you.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>All the funding I receive on Indiegogo will go toward <strong>camera and audio equipment </strong>and a<strong> lap top </strong>with<strong> Final Cut Pro</strong> - all of which will donated to the Itapoa Reserve - and my <strong>plane ticket</strong>. </p>
<p>Luckily I won't need any money once I'm down there (living in the rainforest is free!).</p>
<h3>What you get in return.</h3>
<p>Our money is hard-earned. And some of us don't have much left after bills are paid. I've been a grad student for the past few years; boy do I understand. </p>
<p>Say you skip a latte. Say you buy a book used instead of new. Say you skip a whole week of lattes. Say you don't want to skip any of these things, but you're still able and willing to donate. Or, who knows, you found a balled-up bill at the bottom of the dryer today. Trust me: donating to save the rainforest tastes better than coffee, and smells better than a crispy, new book. Every dollar counts. </p>
<p>What's more, in exchange for your donation, you get awesome stuff from the heart of the Choco rainforest. Check out the perks! There's sustainable chocolate, harvested by locals and made by Itapoa volunteers. There's local artwork. There are framed photos, hand-carved rings, dried and pressed flora - all from the Choco. </p>
<h3>What happens if I don't reach my goal?</h3>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I'll still get the amount I raised, but I'll have pay a higher fee to Indiegogo. I won't be able to donate the new laptop, editing software, camera and audio equipment to Raul and the Itapoa Reserve. </p>
<p>Not reaching my goal would certainly be a hiccup. But I'd hold my breathe, drink some water, and help Raul in whatever capacity I can. I'll still make the video. I'll scrounge up any and all equipment I can to bring with me. I will spend two months in the Choco doing anything and everything I can to protect it.</p>
<h3>Are you having trouble donating through paypal?</h3>
<p>Send me an email: <a href=""mailto:danielle.e.berg@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">danielle.e.berg@gmail.com</a>. We'll work it out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other ways you can help.</h3>
<p>Just because you can't donate money doesn't mean you can't help.</p>
<p><strong>Spread the word!</strong> Do you have a friend who loves to travel? Who loves nature? Who loves South America? Or a friend/family member who enjoys giving to a good cause? Send them on over. </p>
<p><strong>Donate old clothes. </strong>There's lots of bugs in the Choco. I've got to keep covered from neck to ankle, in heat-friendly colors/material. Got stuff with holes and stains? I'll take it.</p>
<p><strong>Got any photo/video equipment? Editing software? A connection that'll offer a discount? </strong>Email me. </p>

Say you skip a latte. Say you buy a book used instead of new. Say you skip a whole week of lattes. Say you don't want to skip any of these things, but you're still able and willing to donate. Or, who knows, you found a balled-up bill at the bottom of the dryer today. Trust me: donating to save the rainforest tastes better than coffee, and smells better than a crispy, new book. Every dollar counts. 
What's more, in exchange for your donation, you get awesome stuff from the heart of the Choco rainforest. Check out the perks! There's sustainable chocolate, harvested by locals and made by Itapoa volunteers. There's local artwork. There are framed photos, hand-carved rings, dried and pressed flora - all from the Choco. 
What happens if I don't reach my goal?
If I don't reach my goal, I'll still get the amount I raised, but I'll have pay a higher fee to Indiegogo. I won't be able to donate the new laptop, editing software, camera and audio equipment to Raul and the Itapoa Reserve. 
Not reaching my goal would certainly be a hiccup. But I'd hold my breathe, drink some water, and help Raul in whatever capacity I can. I'll still make the video. I'll scrounge up any and all equipment I can to bring with me. I will spend two months in the Choco doing anything and everything I can to protect it.
Are you having trouble donating through paypal?
Send me an email: danielle.e.berg@gmail.com. We'll work it out.


Other ways you can help.
Just because you can't donate money doesn't mean you can't help.
Spread the word! Do you have a friend who loves to travel? Who loves nature? Who loves South America? Or a friend/family member who enjoys giving to a good cause? Send them on over. 
Donate old clothes. There's lots of bugs in the Choco. I've got to keep covered from neck to ankle, in heat-friendly colors/material. Got stuff with holes and stains? I'll take it.
Got any photo/video equipment? Editing software? A connection that'll offer a discount? Email me.

Since I could remember I have always wanted to do something to help someone else. My grandfather was a police officer so I looked up to him keeping my community safe; but that type of job wasn’t for me. It wasn’t till I teamed up with Planet Rag that I knew I wanted to help people abroad, in other countries that didn’t have all the luxuries I did growing up. I know the way it feels to get something new (to me). I want the families in Uganda to feel what it feels like to get something. To have that weight lifted off their shoulders because they finally have a decent set of clothes to wear.</p>
<p>$3,200 will cover all expenses for the trip and getting the clothes to Mabare, Uganda. I'm saving up myself from working when im not in classes and I would be so stoked just to make it to $1800 for my plane ticket. I will be spending 2 weeks there not only handing out clothes to families but I will be helping extend the pipeline of a well and helping with community education workshops. Im planning to use space bags and jam pack my suitcase and all my fellow travelers extra suitcases with the clothes to get it all there.</p>
<p>I currently am teaming with Planet Rag in starting textile recycling drives. I have already started collecting reusable clothes to help. I plan to take this as far as all schools in my county. I am also in the process of bringing this back to where I’m from in central California to get as much as possible to bring to Uganda. ALL reusable clothing will be properly sanitized and sorted before bringing to Uganda. ALL textile scraps will be collected and sold to textile recycling companies in bulk to help with costs of the trip.</p>
<p>From Planet Rag: ""We at Planet Rag are here to get the word out for textile recycling. Not only do we want to recycle our textiles, but we want to reuse them in any way possible. Most people look over the fact that textiles are recyclable. Going to Uganda to donate clothing to families in need does not only help us reuse our textiles. It brings a smile to some people that may not get new clothing often. It’s not always about the big things that change the world, it sometimes can come down to the little things that can make just one person happy.</p>
<p>It is vital that we aid in lighting the load on our Mother Earth. Each year we send an enormous 11.1 million tons of textiles to our landfills. In fact, the average American disposes 65lbs of clothing and textiles each year and only 10lbs are actually recycled.</p>
<p>Essentially 99% of all garments and textiles are recyclable.""</p>
<p>When I go to Uganda I plan on keeping a daily blog going of my trip. I want to make sure everyone supporting this project knows exactly what’s going on.

<h2><em><strong>With the $7,000 raised through this campaign, ACT will repair and renovate the Yachaikury School's dilapidated infrastructure, including the construction of two additional dormitories, with the goal of bolstering the school's capacity as the central hub in a network of associated schools primarily serving indigenous and peasant communities.</strong></em></h2>
<h3><strong>The Amazon Conservation Team (ACT)</strong></h3>
<p>The Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) was established in 1996 to work in partnership with indigenous people of tropical South America to protect biodiversity, improve health, and strengthen culture in an effort to preserve one of the world's most precious resources, the Amazon rainforest. By helping indigenous communities work in close collaboration, ACT has created a powerful and effective alliance of stakeholders working to conserve the Amazon.</p>
<h3><strong>The Yachaikury School of Colombia</strong></h3>
<p>ACT firmly believes that the most effective way to protect the indigenous people of the Amazon is to protect the rainforest to which they are inextricably tied. At the same time, we believe an especially effective way to protect the rainforest is to protect and strengthen indigenous youth, empowering them to address the many challenges they face.</p>
<p>Fundamental to this process is <strong>providing culturally relevant educational opportunities</strong> to indigenous youth. With funding provided by this campaign, ACT will build dormitories to house students and utilize an entrepreneurial educational model, ethnoeducation.  Ethnoeducation integrates native traditions and modern academic instruction to support the values and viability of native communities.</p>
<p>The environmental and traditional education of indigenous youth is essential to the survival of the forests and cultures within them. In Colombia, in the transition zone between the Andes and the Amazon, indigenous and peasant communities face staggering environmental and social pressures. In June 2000, ACT helped establish the Yachaikury Ethno-Education School in this region to empower indigenous youth who will ultimately become guardians of the rainforest. Nearly 75% of its students live in the school's dormitories. <strong>However, the school does not have adequate infrastructure, computer equipment, desks, or learning materials for its students. </strong>Moreover, the school does not have enough resources to feed all of its students, nor pay its staff and administration.  If we are fortunate enough to surpass our goal with your help, we will address these additional critical issues as well.</p>
<h3><strong>The Global Impact of Educating the Children of the Forest</strong></h3>
<p>The key to containing global climate change is the protection of the rainforests. When a tree is burned, the primary driver of global warming, carbon, is released. We must empower the future guardians of the forests to prevent the killing of these trees. <strong>Funding construction of dormitories at the Yachaikury School allows ACT to provide the tools these children, the future guardians of the forest, need to control their lands, preserve their culture, and lead the fight against encroaching deforestation.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>To show our gratitude for your generosity, we would like to offer these tokens of appreciation:</p>

<p>Most of the world’s designed items are harmful to the environment and society. Design is often centered on overconsumption and waste with countless impacts up and down the supply chain. From digital media to print publishing, graphic design has a profound affect on the health of the planet and it’s people. We want to turn this around.</p>
<p>Consider a simple product packaging for a moment. Perhaps it’s a new cosmetic or an electronic device. Think about the length of time between the moment you spot it on the store shelf until you get it home, rip it open, and remove the product inside. How long did that take? This is the wasteful story of 90% of graphic design products. As designer Scott Ewen aptly described it, “I make beautiful trash.” The scariest part is that this is only one small part of the story. The the journey of materials and where they came from is missing. How was the packaging made or how were the materials put together? Who was affected by their sourcing? Were the employees treated fairly?</p>
<p>Combine that concern with the growing economical and social risks from global warming,  designers need to change the way they create to not only curb rising greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), but reverse it.

<h3>How Re-nourish started</h3>
<p>We both went through the same serendipitous experience one thousand miles apart in the same week. While grocery shopping—Eric in Illinois and Yvette in Massachusetts—we noticed (more so than usual) the copious amounts of packaging and plastic that filled each fluorescently lit aisle. All of the graphic design in the grocery stores is just making a short pit stop before an eternity in the landfill. We both vividly remember feeling deflated yet more motivated than ever to inspire change as we discussed the experience after our coinciding shopping trips. Waste, and the endless connected problems associated with it, is a wicked problem. It seems like it can’t be solved. We asked how can—and will—our profession ever evolve? Is it hopeless? What can we do?</p>
<p>Since 2008 we have been working together with the one goal of making the outcomes of the graphic design profession sustainable. To do so we created <a href=""https://re-nourish.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Re-nourish</a>, a nonprofit organization that provides online interactive tools, resources, a podcast, and consulting to create positive change in our field.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>Why does it cost so much to update and improve the Re-nourish calculator?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Great question! Updating and improving the calculator tool requires significant research on the latest metrics, science and conversions. It also requires bringing the current information up to date on the printing industry's best and latest practices. Time = money my friends! The second  stage of the calculator updates involves some complicated development and backend coding using something SQL databases and Ajax and javascript and other languages we've never really heard of. It's pretty hard-core nerd, even to us, so that's why we have to hire some pretty talented folks to bring our vision to life. It will be worth it, we're sure.</p>
<p><strong>What updates can we look forward to on the Re-nourish calculator ?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With the calculator updates, users will be able to choose different units of measurement (the metric system!) and add in other materials in addition to paper (like fabric, web press sheets, etc). Our goal is to create user accounts so that you can save your projects and compare your savings over time and include more detailed and accurate environmental savings data. </p>
<p><strong>Why should I donate to the educators portion of the site if I don't teach?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Another great question! First off, you might end up teaching one day! We never thought we'd be educators, but low and behold, here we are. It is quite a rewarding and challenging profession! But back to your questions... the money that goes toward this section of the site will pay for technical help to develop a strong educator-driven project/curriculum community. Young designers need a design foundation that is rooted in the tenets of sustainability. There is not enough of this happening in our colleges and universities, and those educators who want to get started teaching this topic lack the time and resources to make a change on their own. Your donation will help on the technical side of this portion of the site giving young designers more of a shot of changing the industry starting with their first class. </p>
<p><strong>What does the money go toward for Onward Radio season 2?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">During season 1, we relied on Apple GarageBand and some free software to make Skype not sound so tinny and yucky. Eric did the recording tech, interview preparation, and sound editing. It was a lot of work that delayed many of the episodes. We aim to hire an assistant to help with some of these efforts and invest in better recording software and equipment to create a better product.

Then we buy/export tons of it at premium prices, roast and package, then create new markets on behalf of farmer partners. Since 2009, we've invested 100% of sale proceeds and donations into our supply chain to ensure impact through:

Premium prices: we pay a minimum of $3 per pound green (double the price most coffee companies pay), which put thousands into the pockets of small-scale producers.


Continuous improvement: We've returned over $86,000 from roasted coffee sales to improve harvest management, upgrade equipment, building repairs, more.

Building a Movement:  we've helped other non-profits to raise over $150,000 through Singing Rooster's coffee fund raiser program. 


What’s next?  Farmers need help regenerating tired, old coffee fields while simultaneously promoting reforestation on Haiti's bare mountains.
What We Need + What You Get
Farmers have already raised $4,000 from roasted coffee sale proceeds to build a seedling nursery.  They need an additional $4,000 to complete the project.  Combined, their hard earned $4,000 with your $4,000 in donations will provide greater incomes and promote reforestation efforts:  

Coffee trees have a perfect root structure for holding delicate mountain soil in place: horizontal roots stretch for meters.

Since coffee provides income, they won't be cut down for firewood. 

Coffee trees thrive in the shade of larger trees, and therefore they serve as protectors of the forest (shade trees won’t be cut down either).

We need your help. 100% of your dollars will go directly towards building a coffee seedling nursery, which will produce over 32,000 seedlings.
$10 = 40 seedlings, which grow into earth-stabilizing and productive trees for 20 years.
The Impact 
32,000 coffee trees will generate:
over 640,000 pounds of coffee across a 20-year period
over $2,200,000 in farmer income
soil stability, which improves watersheds & water availability
protection of taller, old-growth trees

dignity/autonomy - farmers want meaningful employment

with the Sun</i></b>
is a documentary on the urgent need to harden the power grid against X-class
solar flares. X-Class flares are hundreds of times more powerful than normal
flares and, if one of them should directly hit the Earth, scientists say its
electro-magnetic energy would knock out the power grid, not just for hours or
days, but for years. That’s because primary transformers would be destroyed,
and it takes up to two years to replace them – assuming the factories that
build them have electrical power to do so. </p>
<p>Fortunately, X-Class
flares occur only two or three times each year, and few of those hit the Earth.
But, unfortunately, one <i>does</i> hit the Earth about every
one-hundred-and-fifty years, on average. The last one occurred 155 years ago! <br/><br/>
Earth is racing to keep its next appointment with the Sun. When it happens, it
will present a challenge that has never occurred before in history. X-class
flares have bombarded this planet for millions of years, but power grids have
existed less than 100 years. The two have never come together – at least not
yet – but it is inevitable.<br/><br/><b>THE GRID IS VULNERABLE</b><br/>
Power grids currently are not hardened to withstand a direct hit by an X-Class
solar flare. If that were to happen now, the consequences would be apocalyptic.
There is no other word to describe the collapse of modern civilization that
would follow the long-term loss of electricity. Mankind would say goodbye to
lights, refrigerators, furnaces, water from pipes, sewage disposal, trash
removal, television, Internet, telephones, computers, hospitals, pharmacies,
credit cards, banks, grocery stores, gasoline stations, automobiles, trains,
air travel, and police protection. The worst suffering would occur in cities
and suburbs. It has been estimated that 80% of the population would perish
within a few months. </p>

with the Sun
is a documentary on the urgent need to harden the power grid against X-class
solar flares. X-Class flares are hundreds of times more powerful than normal
flares and, if one of them should directly hit the Earth, scientists say its
electro-magnetic energy would knock out the power grid, not just for hours or
days, but for years. That’s because primary transformers would be destroyed,
and it takes up to two years to replace them – assuming the factories that
build them have electrical power to do so. 
Fortunately, X-Class
flares occur only two or three times each year, and few of those hit the Earth.
But, unfortunately, one does hit the Earth about every
one-hundred-and-fifty years, on average. The last one occurred 155 years ago! 
Earth is racing to keep its next appointment with the Sun. When it happens, it
will present a challenge that has never occurred before in history. X-class
flares have bombarded this planet for millions of years, but power grids have
existed less than 100 years. The two have never come together – at least not
yet – but it is inevitable.THE GRID IS VULNERABLE
Power grids currently are not hardened to withstand a direct hit by an X-Class
solar flare. If that were to happen now, the consequences would be apocalyptic.
There is no other word to describe the collapse of modern civilization that
would follow the long-term loss of electricity. Mankind would say goodbye to
lights, refrigerators, furnaces, water from pipes, sewage disposal, trash
removal, television, Internet, telephones, computers, hospitals, pharmacies,
credit cards, banks, grocery stores, gasoline stations, automobiles, trains,
air travel, and police protection. The worst suffering would occur in cities
and suburbs. It has been estimated that 80% of the population would perish
within a few months.

  United States, not just for a day or an hour, but for months to years.""~~ Michio Kaku, Professor of Theoretical

I'm Tyler, the compiler of
this idea.I have lots of plant medicines and crafts to offer you, if you'll help me move
north, for a new farming job this year!The video above gives a broader explanation, as does the paragraphs below.Further down, I explain the specifics of the ""perks""Please contact me if this setup is confusing, or if you'd like to discuss anything.(flowers soaking in vodka; yarrow on left, st. john's wort on right)After completing my degree
in Sustainable Agriculture, I moved to Vermont last year to work on
a small organic farm - teaching young people about barn animals,
garden plants, and herbal medicines.That setting allowed lots
of wild-crafting of the Earth's bounty! I gratefully picked from the
ground's gifts - and now I have so many herbal teas and tinctures,
medicinal salves and oils!So, could I mail anyone a small tin of
healing salve, or an ounce of calming tincture? How about a non-tobacco, legal smoking blend? Or a few bags of nourishing herbal tea?!I want to share this
abundance with my friends, while also getting the green paper that's
necessary to begin this next stage of my journey..This year, I'll be living
in southwest Wisconsin at New Forest Farm - the home base of author and real-world permaculture farmer Mark Shepard!! I
will be managing several acres of vegetables for the Organic Valley
Cooperative, as well as learning alongside Mark about his integrated
perennial polycultures of fruit and nut trees, & much more. 
This endeavor entails
northward travel, and a few months of rental expenses - at least till the spring asparagus goes to market. All
money I currently have, and could raise through this campaign, will
be used to get established in Wisconsin, and attend a few
relevant trainings this Spring.  (http://mosesorganic.org/organic-university/farmscale-permaculture/)(http://www.permaculturevoices.com/)(New Forest Farm, Viola, WI)Thus - If you'll help me
travel north, get settled, and start learning - I can send you any of
my wild-harvested and organically cultivated plant medicines. And if
you're trying to stay cozy this winter, I could make you one my
famous winter hats, or a pair of my hand-knitted warm socks!

Check out what I have
to offer, and communicate with me further. Let's talk about how we can cultivate some healing
synergy, for our bodies, and the planet, this growing season!revolutionbytruth@gmail.com
(quart jar on left: beebalm tincture, quart jar on right: damiana/Skullcap tincture, 4oz jar on top right: st. johns wort infused oil)
PERK POSSIBILITIES:Salves:1. Holy Healing Salve--""""promotes the healing of bruises, sprains, fractures.. & provides effective treatment for most minor skin problems .. & stimulates tissue repair"" (comfrey leaf, calendula and st. john's wort flowers)2. Summer 2014 Blend: --aids the healing of small cuts & abrasions, mild rashes, bug bits, poison ivy, dry skin (comfrey, plantain,
mint, & jewelweed leaf; heal-all & calendula flowers)3. Lipbalm:Same plants as the 2014 blend, but put in a lip balm tube.             


Tinctures:
1. Scarlet Beebalm-- I'm still learning this plant's power. Here's some commentary; but I'd recommend humility, awe, and experimentation if you try this flower. 2. Damiana & Skullcap Blend -- ""nerve tonic, antidepressant, sexual restorative, antispasmodic""3. Summer 2014 Blend  -- ""relaxing tonic for anxiety, restlessness and irritability""(lemonbalm, beebalm, catnip, & st. john's wort)Smoking Blend: 1. Summer 2014 Mix-- Great to mix with, or to wean from, tobacco. Could be inhaled by itself, or mixed with other herbs. Inspired by Mtn Rose. (damiana, skullcap, coltsfoot, lobelia, mint) 2. Respiratory Repair- The closest thing to a healthy cigarette. But don't add tobacco to this. These plants are effective antiseptics, expectorants, antispasmodics, & demulcents.(coltsfoot, mullein)Smoking BlendTea BlendHerbal Tea Blends:CUSTOM TEA BLENDS ONLY.. Red raspberry base, and then pick one or two of the following:Dried Leaves of:-Coltsfoot(2), Damiana, Lobelia, Lemonbalm, Mullein, Mint, Skullcap, Red Raspberry (LEAF, not fruit) & Yarrow BlossomsORHand-Knitted Hat and Socks
These can come in variable colors, but most of my yarn stock are earth-tones.

No more harmful minerals, only H2O. Project ScheduleProject Research - This is where we discovered the potential of this innovation and have designed properly each of its characteristics.  Prototype - The phase where we built the prototype, which has validated the arrangement of the new purification process. We have already invested over 1,000,000€ up to this point. Pilot Plant Initiation - We now need your help to redesign the small prototype into the larger-scale pilot plant, and to secure the workshop facility where we will be building and testing this pilot plant. Pilot Plant Launch - Building the pilot plant and obtaining the water quality certification. At this point, we will offer this unit to a town/community of your choice. Large Scale Production - We will then be able to produce large-scale modular units. This will change how the world purifies water. How does it work? The Advantages of MVT vs. ROReverse Osmosis (RO) has taken the lead of the desalination market thanks to its lower global cost than the Thermal Processes, but at the price of a seriously increased complexity regarding the design and the operation.Back-to-the-Basics, MVT offers a simple process, as stable as the Thermal processes, and much more cost-effective :
30+% cheaper than RO on CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) thanks to its simplicity and its modular concept
30+% more efficient on Electrical Energy consumption
Very limited OPEX, similar to Thermal processes
No need for a pretreatment (which is a huge handicap for RO, regarding stability and Capex)
No need to perform much site investigation like full water analysis over a year, 12m. bathymetry, etc.
No Boron related concern, very low TDS product water, directly compatible with partial or full industrial uses
Easy to operate
Easy to upgrade or decrease the capacity in the future
No high pressure, no high temperature, no need for noble stainless steels, no need for local high skills
 Energy Advantage*The power consumption of the MVT core process is very close to the technical minimum achievable energy consumption. In other words, it would become impossible to make this process much more efficient than we have made it. (*) Core process consumption (without auxiliaries or pre-treatment) including the compressor and the electrical motor efficiencies. For seawater at 35 g/L. (1) Mechanical Vapour Transfer. (2) Reverse Osmosis/Seawater Reverse Osmosis. (3) Thermal Processes. CAPEX AdvantageThe table below compares the CAPEX of an MVT desalination plant vs. RO of the same capacity.  How Come ...?""To be honest, I wasn’t even trying to improve MVC, I was looking for a way to take advantage of the low-but-existing delta-temperature which resides between the oceans and their surrounding atmosphere, mostly always except two times a day during the inversions.After having modelled a nice process involving a master heat pump with a very high COP (coefficient of performance), the idea just came, in order to further reduce the losses of efficiency, to simply replace the heat pump with a sheet of thermal material. Doing this, was just bringing my new concept back into the field of the MVC, almost ignoring it like Professor Calculus…The result is MVT, an MVC with a virgin approach, a modular simple concept, and a set of so-far unexploited low-energy operating points leading to a specific energy consumption close to the minimum theoretical limit achievable for desalting.""- Francois-M.

<p>
	Edgewalkers is an emerging collective of semi-nomadic wildland tenders. Winter Social Forestry Camp is an experiment in regenerative wild-tending, where a small
community of people comes together to work at restoring a landscape while living in reciprocal
relationship to nature. Camped out in a temporary primitive village
in the woods, we work on improving the ecological
quality of the landscape through <a href=""https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxtaW5kLW5ldC10b20td2FyZC1wZXJtYWN1bHR1cmUtY291bnNlbG9yLXRlYW1zLWVkaXRpb24tYmFja3VwfGd4OjE0MzZhNmQ0YTVlZmEzZDI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Social Forestry</a>. We focus on tending wild plants and forests
that provide sustenance as food, medicine, timber, and craft
material. We are doing this work on wildlands held in public trust, in a mutually

This is the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/winter-social-forestry-camp-2014/x/5473210"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">second year of our camp</a>, and there will be 10 of us coming together for 10 weeks nestled in the mountains on the edge of the Cascades and Siskiyous in southern Oregon.<br/></p>

<p style="""">The coast of SW Madagascar
is home to many rural communities that rely on mangrove forests
for its wood (firewood and construction) and animals (fish, crabs, shrimp). However, the rapidly growing population – 71% of one
commune’s population is under 21 years old – has meant more pressure on
mangrove forests and degradation/deforestation of this amazing ecosystem that is also incredibly important to the livelihoods of local people.

for its wood (firewood and construction) and animals (fish, crabs, shrimp). However, the rapidly growing population – 71% of one
commune’s population is under 21 years old – has meant more pressure on
mangrove forests and degradation/deforestation of this amazing ecosystem that is also incredibly important to the livelihoods of local people.

Honko Mangrove
Conservation & Education, a small NGO based in Ambondrolava, Madagascar,
has been working these coastal rural communities since 2007 to
promote community-based mangrove conservation and develop alternative
livelihoods to simultaneously reduce dependence on mangrove resources and
alleviate poverty. Our diverse initiatives, all while working closely alongside
the community and local management association, have included:

environmental education


awareness about the importance of mangroves and management


village-based
fish farming


apiculture

women's vannerie association

development of a community-based Plan Vivo
carbon credit project that will allow the community to invest in their own
conservation and community development projects

and more...

Honko's trusty truckThroughout Honko’s
years of existence, our truck has been with us through thick and
thin, providing an essential helping hand for almost every one of our projects.
However, the truck is in urgent need of repairs or, unfortunately, retirement...
In order to continue
working towards Honko’s mission, we are raising funds to purchase a used vehicle that will continue the priceless assistance that our beloved,
retirement-worthy truck has given us, including building village-based tree
nurseries and leading village awareness events among many other activities in
the year 2014. This will ensure that Honko can continue its valuable work on
the ground throughout its five project area villages for years to come.
How you can help, and what's in it for you!     Now is your
opportunity to be part of this truly effective, locally-based conservation
effort! By making a contribution towards our purchase of a new truck, you will
ensure the continuity of Honko’s community-based conservation and poverty
alleviation efforts in SW Madagascar. It sounds cliché, but it is 100% true, every contribution counts! From a heartfelt thank you postcard from Honko, to a school mural painted in your
name - every dollar will bring us closer to our fundraising goal of $8,500. All funds
raised will be used towards the search for a
new vehicle, or on repairs to significantly extend the lifespan of our trusty truck if we fall below the goal.On the right hand side
of this page you can see in detail the various perks that you can receive - our way of saying “THANK YOU!!” the best
that we can all the way from here in Ambondrolava. And don’t feel limited by
the options to the right – we are happy to receive any help that you are able
to contribute :)Can’t contribute at this time? Here’s how else

<p></p>
<p>My name is Ricca Slone. I teach public policy in Chicago, but in 2011-2012 I taught English at a rural school in Orissa state in eastern India.  Watching the Indian women collect and carry fuelwood, and cook over smoky open stoves, made me want to help them find a safer way to feed their families. </p>Millions of women collecting firewood every day for cooking fuel causes severe deforestation. The World Health Organization estimates that hazardous indoor air pollution from primitive cookstoves causes <i>2 million excess deaths every year</i>. <p></p>
<p>My idea is to introduce clean solar cooking to these women. I brought a small household-sized solar oven, the Global Sun Oven, to a rural school in India and the kids were fascinated by it! </p>
<p>An American company makes a big version of this solar cookstove called the Villager Sun Oven.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Villager Oven can cook a hot lunch for 200 children using just clean solar energy! </span></p>
<p>I formed a company called Sun Oven India to import Villager Sun Ovens to India for a one-year demonstration. Sun Oven India brought two Villager Ovens to India in 2012. Now we want to bring more Villager Sun Ovens to India and train the cooks, so they will understand how to use the ovens efficiently and how the ovens can keep them healthy.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us bring clean solar cooking to four rural schools in India this year, and six more next year. We will train village.women, and learn whether using the big ovens will increase their acceptance of solar cooking in their own homes.</p>

<p>Each Villager oven weights 980 lbs. and costs $9,500. It costs another $1,000 for a set of cooking pots and a simple trailer to move the oven indoors when needed for security. It costs at least another $1,000 per oven to ship it from the US to India, pay the import duties, and local transport in India. We also provide special cooking pots, stepladders to help raise the solar panels on the oven, and oven mitts to keep the cooks from burning themselves.</p>
<p>I am asking for $11,000 per oven. Sun Oven India will donate the balance for each oven. Four big sun ovens with all the items that go with them fill one shipping container for transport on a cargo ship. </p>

<p><strong>The Electric Car Revolution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whats the Goal?</strong></p>
<p>To promote the increased usage of Electric Cars around the world through a new online magazine and webforum! We also want to emphasize the fun that electric cars are now and will increasingly become in the future along with all the new clean tech advancements that are being made in regards to all electric vehicles that will help to further clean up our world. </p>
<p>As the magazine and forum start to make money we will start donating to various cities with the goal of helping them transition from carbon based automotive systems to completely 100% electric fleets and related support systems. </p>
<p><strong>The Problem and Solution</strong></p>
<p>There are many new fully electric cars currently on the market but unfortunately there is no central source of information where all the benefits and other related info on these exciting new vehicles can be promoted, I hope to fill that void with the new online forum and magazine.  </p>
<p>I firmly believe that the electric car market will continue to grow drastically over the next few decades. This aforementioned growth will benefit first and foremost the environment that we live in and love so much but secondly itll help to get more and more people into and driving 100% electric cars as they become more aware and knowledgable on Electric Cars.</p>
<p>No other automotive technology makes as much sense as a pure 100% electric car. Batteries and their related cost and lifecycle were the hurdle with past electric cars but because battery technology today is accelerating at such an excitingly fast pace the overall cost of electric cars will begin to decrease drastically year after year, all of which will help to make electric cars more and more popular with the average driver. </p>
<p><strong>Some benefits of 100% All Electric Cars:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Good for Earths long term survival</li>
<li>Clean</li>
<li>Decrease usage of carbon based pollutants in our cities and thus lives</li>
<li>Powerful</li>
<li>Help grow the renewable energy sector</li>
<li>Futuristic</li>
<li>Fun</li>
<li>Low maintenance cost</li>
<li>New</li>
<li>Quiet</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where do your donations go?</strong></p>
<p>All donations will go to the building of All Electric Drivers.com’s online magazine and web forum.</p>
<p>I will pay a graphic designer to make us a nice professional logo.</p>
<p>I will be using the money to pay a web programmer to do coding for me to help build the magazine and to maintain the website.  </p>
<p>I will also have a close friend help with the global promotion of the site so we can increase traffic drastically.</p>
<p>I personally will write some articles but I also have a few friends who are very enthusiastic about electric cars that I will pay for their help.   </p>
<p> <strong>What will be in the magazine and on the related web forum?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Discussion of new Electric Car Models</li>
<li>Magazine articles and editorials on anything to do with Electric Cars</li>
<li>General Info about Electric Cars</li>
<li>And a whole bunch of other awesome electric car related info</li>
<li>Discussions and Articles on how 100% all Electric Cars benefit our environment</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With a little help from some generous donations and some good promotion from the online magazine and forum, we should be able to spread the news and encourage more and more people of all the benefits that can come from driving All Electric Cars both now and into the future.</p>
<p>And even if you can’t help financially you can still help by reading our future articles related to electric cars, participating in our forums, and simply just by spreading the news of our new online magazine and forum.</p>
<p><br/> Lastly A big Thank You to anyone who decides to help me promote the wonders and benefits that comes with driving all electric cars.  </p>

<div>Greetings!<br/>My name is Gretchen Elsner, and I am writing from Athens Georgia.I have been living in Athens building a solar powered travel trailer from the ground up since 2009.</div>

It has been built from new, but mostly recycled materials gleaned from light gauge steel construction projects in the area, the local Habitat for Humanity ReStore, locally reclaimed wood, the talents of local artisans, and information absorbed by a complete novice builder at the local library. It has also been built almost entirely by bicycle. I am committed environmentalist, and I have been endeavoring to build a fully modern home that will be powered only by the eight gel batteries I have and the panels I will soon install. Here to fore I have payed for the project as I go, working still as a clothing designer and pop-up book maker, as is my craft, trade and profession for the past 13 years, as well as working construction, industrial solar installation, waitress and as a portrait model for artists. In many ways this home represents the power of a double dream, providing the basic needs for housing in a world of increasing economic and environmental instability, as well as offering a model for establishing a paradigm change that I believe can inspire and transform how art, engineering and efficacy shapes our lives.

After inverter manufactured by Magnum Energy, light weight honeycomb paneling for the sub flooring manufactured by Plasticor. All these are American made products. I also intend to hire local solar enectricaian Garry Dale to work with me on this project.

Up
 Jamaica Ltd. strongly believes that it is every person's human right to
 have
access to nature’s original gifts- organic, non GMO healthy foods and a

economic conditions are unfavorable across the globe right now, Jamaica 
is a
prime example of how an entire nation's way of life is compromised once 
these

don't know is that food prices are based on the US

wage equivalent to
$50 US dollars, make it?  Farm Up Jamaica Ltd. has identified a 
strategic
way to begin tackling both the economic and agricultural issues that 
have been
standing in the way of Jamaica's prosperity, for decades.  By supplying
farmers with everything from seeds to workforce, we will begin to 
introduce local markets to inexpensive organic foods and decrease the 
need to import unhealthy, genetically modified crops. Ultimately, we 
will create tons of good jobs while closing the gap on importation of 
foreign foods.  Join us on this life-changing journey as we make major 
strides towards an economy's recovery.</b></p>
<h1>OUR
STORY</h1>
<p>Farm
Up Jamaica Ltd. is an international organization formed in the U.S. with
offices in New York State and Jamaica.  The organization is comprised of
both Jamaican and multinational professionals from all over the world 
who have
a heart-felt interest in global sustainability. Our mission is to assist
distressed farmers in the sustainable cultivation of vacant, 
under-farmed lands
and to decrease the importation of foreign foods.  Farm Up Jamaica Ltd.
has already garnered the support of the Jamaica Ministry of Agriculture 
in
order to strategically identify crops that are needed to help close the 
gap on
importation, enabling us to have a direct impact on the market.  The 
Ministry of Agriculture has agreed to
work closely with us in order to ensure success.  They have also already
 helped
us locate farmers and farmlands in order to cultivate the crops that are
 in
highest demand. Through
professional evaluation of land conditions and feasibility we have 
determined
where to designate our first crops. This assessment takes into 
consideration irrigation,
soil quality, seeding, access, roadways, staffing, maintenance, reaping,
storage, logistics and more.  Our organization is going the extra mile 
by taking an
organic approach to farming.  We will demonstrate that an organic farm 
is
a more wholesome, more cost effective farm. Going forward, the crops we 
will
focus on are onions, ginger, rice, irish potatoes, and pineapples.  The 
demand
for these crops currently exceeds local production and greatly cripples 
the economic
potential of the entire country. We have divided our crop-planting 
initiative into segments- in order to focus on successfully reaching 
tangible goals that
have a direct, economic impact!  </p>
<h1>OUR
PROJECT</h1>
<p>Our initiative will focus solely on non-GMO, organic onion production.   We have
devised a concise model for this project, guaranteeing success upon completion.
With your support, we will be planting 5 acres of non-GMO, organic onions on a 100-acre
farm in Mandeville, Jamaica. Together, we will provide the resources
needed...from start to finish.  Upon
completing this project we will be closing the gap on importation of onions
into Jamaica by 1% for the upcoming year! The great thing about our project is
that we have plenty of available, under-farmed lands, so any monies pledged
past our $75,000 goal, will simply go towards planting more onions - and
closing more of the gap!</p>
<h1>HOW
&amp; WHY OUR PROJECT WILL WORK</h1>
<p>The
demand for onions in the local market is 10,000 tons per year.  Jamaica
only produces approximately 1,000 tons per year.  This means that 9,000 
tons
of onions are currently being imported into Jamaica every year.  The
Jamaican population and its economy suffer for two main reasons due to 
this
shortfall: onions are sold locally at higher prices and the quality of 
the onions is compromised, as genetically modified, non-organic 
production
is the latest trend.  All participating farmers have expressed having
patriotic feelings about this project, which will keep them inspired and
focused. They are all very excited because they will have access to 
fresh,
organic onions to eat and sell; these farmers realize they are making a 
huge
contribution to their country.  The
professional evaluation of the land condition and feasibility has been
conducted and the farm has been approved! The scheduled start date for 
land
preparation is December 10, 2013.  We will need to prepare the land with
access roads, proper irrigation and all necessary facilities.  A work
force has been assembled consisting of core, Farm Up Jamaica Operations 
Team
Members, coupled with paid and volunteer local citizens, inner city 
youths and
students majoring in Agricultural studies.  Our farmers have each 
already
received a face-to-face tutorial about the program from our team of 
Field
Directors. We have thoroughly discussed onion production and what it 
means to
the country.  Off to work we go!! Our assembled work force will hit the
ground running with the proper machinery and tools to get the land 
sowed.</p>
<p>The farmers and local Farm Up Jamaica workforce
will be responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the farmlands 
until the
time of harvest.  Farm Up Jamaica Ltd. will keep a close eye on the farm
and will monitor its progress through onsite Farm Up Jamaica 
surveillance and
field inspectors- who will create monthly progress reports. To avoid 
potential
praedial larceny, motion-detecting-infrared perimeter protection and 
cameras
will be set up to safe guard our project and all surveillance and 
fencing will
be monitored in a central station. Once the time has come to harvest, 
Farm Up Jamaica
staff and locals will participate in the grand reaping process. Pick up 
and transportation
assistance will be provided to move crops to the receiving purchasers, 
which include resort hotels and restaurants, local farmer's markets, 
supermarkets and grocery stores. Farm Up Jamaica Ltd. will oversee the 
payment process to ensure that all involved are
paid accordingly.  Lastly, we will also sponsor Farmer's Market
events, giving our farmers the opportunity to sell a portion of their 
produce,
directly! </p>
<p><b>By
contributing to this project you are providing 100% assistance to a
tangible, transparent initiative that a great deal of people are relying
on!  </b></p>

We do this with a device called the Air HES, or air hydroelectric station. Air Hes is a weather balloon that is launched thousands of meters into the sky. The device then uses a large ""collector"" to capture cloud moisture as they pass through the device. This water is then sent to the ground through conduit attachments. A turbo generator is then used to generate power from the water pressure to yield energy. </div><h2><b><br/></b></h2><h2><b>Our Mission!</b></h2><div>Our mission is to use our device to provide clean drinking water and energy to impoverished areas without a source of clean, unpolluted drinking water.

<b id="""">3. The Problem with Current Non-Renewable Resources</b>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/795316/files/20140818064721-ff.png?1408369641"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                                                        (Image from thinkprogress.org)<br/><p>The chart above illustrates that 77% of our energy dependence is on NON-renewable resources. Now let's take a look at why this number needs to change.</p>
<br/><p><b>Coal </b></p>
<p>Coal power plants essentially work in the same way that Fission plants do. A turbine is spun by steam that is built up due to the burning of a fuel source (coal). Coal plants may not have the threat of meltdowns, but it is in no way a renewable source. Reserves are dwindling and wars are fought over scarce resources. The burning of coal also produces large amounts of CO2 and other harmful by-products. </p>
<br/><p><b>Natural Gas </b></p>
<p>Using natural gas also poses a problem when trying to remedy the energy crisis.  A huge problem when using this resource stems from the fact that it is so explosive. Natural gas is 80% to 95% methane. It is not only highly explosive but also stored under great pressure. The pipelines used to channel the fuel is also very costly and prone to leaking. This poses a significant threat to the environment.  </p>
<br/><p><b>Fission Nuclear Power</b></p>
<p>Fission power is what most people mean when they refer to Nuclear Power. Fission Power produces a large amount of power output but has significant drawbacks. Radioactive rods can pose a threat to the environment for thousands of years. There is also a threat of nuclear core meltdown or explosions due to the high pressure build-up of the reactors. Deforestation also comes into play when mining for uranium. Truckloads of the metal are needed in order to keep the plants running. </p>
<br/><b>The Toll of Using Non-Renewable Resources</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>
</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The result of analyzing existing technologies usually has pessimistic conclusion that until fossil fuels are finished (which is about a couple of hundred years), mankind will be forced to use it, along the way we try to minimize the problem of accumulation of CO2 and praying to avoid the problem of global climate change. What's next - God knows...</span><br/>
</div><div>
<br/>Weather patterns are getting more irregular and severe. Major disasters can occur as early as 2050-2100. If the climate catastrophe becomes evident, or if reserves of fuel run out, then immediate transition to renewable resources is forced. That would mean the collapse of  human development, reducing its numbers due to hunger and lack of energy and other resources, etc.</div><div><br/></div>

<p></p>
<p><span>Air HES utilizes several technologies that have been carefully developed over hundreds of years. This allows for farming of a previously untouchable resource, the clouds, the very source of precipitation itself.</span></p>
<p><b>The Cloud Collector</b></p>The main component of AirHES is the cloud collector. The cloud collector is a mesh that hangs vertically in the air. Clouds pass through the mesh and any moisture is trapped in the fibers. The water then runs down due to a special coating on the mesh. A trough like reservoir is located at the bottom of the collector and funnels the water down to the attachments. <br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806669/files/20140823082848-peru-fog-catchers_10142_600x450.jpg?1408807728"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Similar cloud collectors have been around since ancient times and were mainly used to collect fog from the tops of mountains. Through the years, water collection from these “fog collectors” have gotten more efficient as researchers began to recognize the benefit the technology could bring to the world. Earlier this year, MIT reported that they have created a fog  collector mesh that is 5 times more efficient in capturing water than any other previous versions. </span></p>
<p><b>The Aerostat</b></p>
<p>The lifting mechanism of the AirHES is the aerostat or Blimp. Essentially a large weather balloon, the aerostat is typically used to track weather conditions and temperatures 60,000 to 120,000 feet in the stratosphere. </p>
<p>We only need a height of about 7,000 feet to reach the mid-level clouds in the troposphere.</p>An aerostat is the perfect candidate for the main lifting force of AirHES because not only can extreme heights be achieved, but also because of the lifting power.<br/><br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/806675/files/20140823083343-AIR_LTA_TARS_Aerostat_lg__1_.jpg?1408808023"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span><b>Isn’t the weight of the tether and water running through the conduit too much weight for a weather balloon?! Balloons provide more lift than most people would think.</b></span></p>
<p>The lifting force of a balloon is increased 8 fold for every 2 fold increase in diameter. This means that if you have a balloon 4 feet in diameter, the amount of lift it could generate would be close to about 2 pounds. Now, suppose you have a balloon 8 feet in diameter, the lift is now 16 lbs. We calculate that with a 60 foot balloon, this yields around 7,000 lbs of lift which is more than enough to carry the weight of the vertical tether and the weight of the water inside. </p>
<p><b>The Turbo Generator</b></p>
<p>We are confident that we can get pure, clean drinking water from our device. Our prototype has already collected around 4 liters of water per hour for each square meter of mesh at 4,000 feet. We aim to use the height of the aerostat to our advantage. This water pressure is tremendous and capable of powering a hydro generator. </p>
<p>Imagine the pressure that a standard water tower yields. The water pressure at a height of 7,000 feet is much greater and we intend to use it.</p>

<p>Estimation for maximal output example calculations:</p>
<p> In a thundercloud, close to the equator, we have up to 5 g/m3 of LWC. Parameters set to only 1 g/m3, the altitude of 5 km, the usual wind speed here of 10 m/s, we get 500 W/m2. For comparing, a NPP unit of 500 MW is equal ~ 1 km2 of the mesh for Air Hydro Power. Not so much. And NPP unit is on the ground with the same space. Plus 100 km2 of emergency zone. And this land is lost forever. But we need only in a small area for the turbine, the rest is in the air 5 km in the sky. </p>

<h2 id="""">What we need the money for?</h2>
<p>
The detailed calculations in the ""<a href=""http://barixa.net/AirHES_feasibility.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Feasibility study</a>"" show that this project can be fantastically beneficial. However to start up this absolutely new revolution in energy, an investors will be the main support. This is why we are launching our IndieGoGo campaign. In order to build a fully functional working prototype scaled up enough for constant water and energy output. This will encourage investors to take the project to phase two.</p>
<p>
We had tested the first scientific prototype last summer (2013/07/30) in Russia through our own funding (~$3k). We suppose that we have gotten approximately 5 liter/m2 per hour (by analyzing the aerostat positions). The water collector proved that we had collected water but the rope holding AirHES broke and exact figures were not obtained. </p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
Now we are going to build another prototype that we could test as a real device for any possible estimates and conditions. You can see in the feasibility study down below that the target sum matches the estimation of the possible total cost of this minimal technical prototype. In other words, we need about $14,052 to make a scaled-up version of AirHES.</p>

<p>
We are sure on 99% that we can demonstrate a workable prototype for attracting investors and further developing this project as business.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>And most importantly:</b> </p>
<blockquote>This may be the most important project in the History that will forever solve the basic problems of mankind (except stupidity, of course) and will provide participants immortality in the memory of posterity in row of the most famous names. <br/>Ultimately, all that a man does - is an attempt to earn a piece of immortality in the form of memory at least through their descendants, at least temporarily. <br/>But here it is, the eternal memory for all generations of all humanity... <br/>So, you will help us go down in history, as the generation that saved the planet. </blockquote>
<p><b>Stretch Goal</b></p>
<p>If we could get ~ $100k from this campaign we could start up this project even without an external investor. Then we will try to start by producing simple devices for fresh water supply (like a portable kite SKY-FOUNTAIN, etc.) and step-by-step to develop our devices for getting energy, hydrogen, and water... We are sure the idea will succeed, and with your help... We can do it!</p>
<p>And, of course, anybody who want can start the same project independently... We will be only glad if anybody will get the result faster and better us - it is a global problem and we will not struggle for priority or market... </p>

Monumental challenges face mankind regarding the state of our energy and natural resource consumption. At the current rate, global water consumption will demand more than supply can handle and by the year 2050, a global water crisis is expected. Cloud Power is the Solution!What is Cloud Power?Cloud Power collects moisture from the clouds and channels it down to earth in the form of water and energy. We do this with a device called the Air HES, or air hydroelectric station. Air Hes is a weather balloon that is launched thousands of meters into the sky. The device then uses a large ""collector"" to capture cloud moisture as they pass through the device. This water is then sent to the ground through conduit attachments. A turbo generator is then used to generate power from the water pressure to yield energy. Our Mission!Our mission is to use our device to provide clean drinking water and energy to impoverished areas without a source of clean, unpolluted drinking water. Our goal is to expand this application world-wide.

Earth's ecosystems are in a constant balance in order to support life on earth. If this balance is broken, life cannot exist.



                                      
The problem of climate imbalance  is not just an issue of comfort. This is a problem facing the future of all life on Earth. For example, In our solar system, our two closest neighbors, Venus and Mars, demonstrate this urgency. Small shifts in climate temperature can cause huge imbalances in ecosystems and affect earth's ability to sustain life. Despite the fact that different climate models give different predictions for impending periods of destruction, we need to focus on the predictions that give us just a few decades before the irreversible consequences.


2. Air Pollution - the main source of the climate problemAll that nature has garnered millions of years in the form of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), humanity will spend in just a couple of centuries since the industrial revolution. Americans use about 20 tons of CO2 per year. The number is steadily rising. ""We have to go from steadily rising (CO2) to steadily falling,"" Bill Gates.
Energy Talk by Bill Gates



3. The Problem with Current Non-Renewable Resources


                                                                                        (Image from thinkprogress.org)The chart above illustrates that 77% of our energy dependence is on NON-renewable resources. Now let's take a look at why this number needs to change.
Coal 
Coal power plants essentially work in the same way that Fission plants do. A turbine is spun by steam that is built up due to the burning of a fuel source (coal). Coal plants may not have the threat of meltdowns, but it is in no way a renewable source. Reserves are dwindling and wars are fought over scarce resources. The burning of coal also produces large amounts of CO2 and other harmful by-products. 
Natural Gas 
Using natural gas also poses a problem when trying to remedy the energy crisis.  A huge problem when using this resource stems from the fact that it is so explosive. Natural gas is 80% to 95% methane. It is not only highly explosive but also stored under great pressure. The pipelines used to channel the fuel is also very costly and prone to leaking. This poses a significant threat to the environment.  
Fission Nuclear Power
Fission power is what most people mean when they refer to Nuclear Power. Fission Power produces a large amount of power output but has significant drawbacks. Radioactive rods can pose a threat to the environment for thousands of years. There is also a threat of nuclear core meltdown or explosions due to the high pressure build-up of the reactors. Deforestation also comes into play when mining for uranium. Truckloads of the metal are needed in order to keep the plants running. 
The Toll of Using Non-Renewable Resources

The result of analyzing existing technologies usually has pessimistic conclusion that until fossil fuels are finished (which is about a couple of hundred years), mankind will be forced to use it, along the way we try to minimize the problem of accumulation of CO2 and praying to avoid the problem of global climate change. What's next - God knows...

Weather patterns are getting more irregular and severe. Major disasters can occur as early as 2050-2100. If the climate catastrophe becomes evident, or if reserves of fuel run out, then immediate transition to renewable resources is forced. That would mean the collapse of  human development, reducing its numbers due to hunger and lack of energy and other resources, etc.
The Science Behind the Invention!How it works






Air HES utilizes several technologies that have been carefully developed over hundreds of years. This allows for farming of a previously untouchable resource, the clouds, the very source of precipitation itself.
The Cloud CollectorThe main component of AirHES is the cloud collector. The cloud collector is a mesh that hangs vertically in the air. Clouds pass through the mesh and any moisture is trapped in the fibers. The water then runs down due to a special coating on the mesh. A trough like reservoir is located at the bottom of the collector and funnels the water down to the attachments. 


Similar cloud collectors have been around since ancient times and were mainly used to collect fog from the tops of mountains. Through the years, water collection from these “fog collectors” have gotten more efficient as researchers began to recognize the benefit the technology could bring to the world. Earlier this year, MIT reported that they have created a fog  collector mesh that is 5 times more efficient in capturing water than any other previous versions. 
The Aerostat
The lifting mechanism of the AirHES is the aerostat or Blimp. Essentially a large weather balloon, the aerostat is typically used to track weather conditions and temperatures 60,000 to 120,000 feet in the stratosphere. 
We only need a height of about 7,000 feet to reach the mid-level clouds in the troposphere.An aerostat is the perfect candidate for the main lifting force of AirHES because not only can extreme heights be achieved, but also because of the lifting power.



Isn’t the weight of the tether and water running through the conduit too much weight for a weather balloon?! Balloons provide more lift than most people would think.
The lifting force of a balloon is increased 8 fold for every 2 fold increase in diameter. This means that if you have a balloon 4 feet in diameter, the amount of lift it could generate would be close to about 2 pounds. Now, suppose you have a balloon 8 feet in diameter, the lift is now 16 lbs. We calculate that with a 60 foot balloon, this yields around 7,000 lbs of lift which is more than enough to carry the weight of the vertical tether and the weight of the water inside. 
The Turbo Generator
We are confident that we can get pure, clean drinking water from our device. Our prototype has already collected around 4 liters of water per hour for each square meter of mesh at 4,000 feet. We aim to use the height of the aerostat to our advantage. This water pressure is tremendous and capable of powering a hydro generator. 
Imagine the pressure that a standard water tower yields. The water pressure at a height of 7,000 feet is much greater and we intend to use it.


Quick Feasibility Examination
This section is a short outline of some external factors that support the need for a more efficient use of the water cycle. The full report of the feasibility study can be found in the following link. Feasibility study

1. Potential Power of the Water Cycle
The Water Cycle is the most powerful process in Nature – about a quarter of all the Sun's energy, or about a half of Sun’s Energy, reaches the Earth. The sun is the primary driving factor in the of weather.


Since AirHES collects moisture from clouds, the annual precipitation is about one meter of rainfall, we can turn that into power equal to about 800 TW. To put this in perspective this amount is:



more than 60 times greater than all the current needs of humanity


more than 400 times greater than all electrical power stations






2. Why can’t traditional hydro power sources harness the same output as AirHES?




By vertical: all precipitation loses most of its potential energy on the way to the ground as it falls


By horizontal: Most precipitation that reaches the ground ends up in oceans or low lying land, which is unavailable to be harnessed.



For example, a river powered hydro station is 200 times less effective than power from cloud precipitation.





3. How to avoid this power loss?




Collect water in place where it condenses, i. e. directly in clouds

AirHES is able to be used in any habitat containing clouds.

It was suggested by Nikola Tesla in 1915. 

4. AirHES is a collaboration of three already well-known devices:





Hydro power already used today


Barrage balloons, or kites

Fog (or here, cloud) collectors

  

5. Patent AERO HPP
Patent RU 2500854 C1 from 17.04.12

International Application PCT/RU2013/000070 (WO2013157991)




SUBSTANCE: device comprises a lower reach 1, an upper reach 2, a water conduit 3, a turbogenerator 4 and surfaces 5. Surfaces 5 are made as capable of receiving atmospheric moisture from the air flow and delivering it to the upper reach. Besides, surface 5 are raised to the height above the dew point for these atmospheric conditions. To support the surfaces 5, balloons or airships 6 are used.EFFECT: expansion of functional capabilities and increased specific capacity of HPP by using maximum possible difference of heights between upper and lower reaches from height of actual condensation of atmospheric moisture in a cloud to ground level.


6. What it gives?




almost eternal and unlimited gratuitous electricity and clean water for drinking and irrigation, and anywhere in the world, where there are clouds


minimum space on the ground (as under this HPP and under power lines), as well as the ability to use any surface (including the vast areas of deserts, seas, oceans, etc.)


modular (you can collect any power plants from standard modules)


mobility (for rapid redeployment, if necessary, or even for use in transport, for example, to supply ocean ships by electricity and drink water)


Its cleanliness and ecologically efficiency


Relatively small local hydro flows ( in comparing with conventional HPP)


significantly lower capital costs per unit of capacity and operational costs by comparing with any other known types of renewable and non-renewable energy


possibility of additional uses for network communication, video surveillance, high-rise advertising, lightning protection, climate protection (for example, against hurricanes and tornadoes in the U.S. by placement on the seaboard of Gulf of Mexico), regulation of climate (by cutting off rains in St. Petersburg by placement on the dam at the prevailing southwest wind rose), AD (for example, for Israel), shade in hot countries, and much more…




7. Economical prospective view (Some Math for you!)

Estimation for maximal output example calculations:
 In a thundercloud, close to the equator, we have up to 5 g/m3 of LWC. Parameters set to only 1 g/m3, the altitude of 5 km, the usual wind speed here of 10 m/s, we get 500 W/m2. For comparing, a NPP unit of 500 MW is equal ~ 1 km2 of the mesh for Air Hydro Power. Not so much. And NPP unit is on the ground with the same space. Plus 100 km2 of emergency zone. And this land is lost forever. But we need only in a small area for the turbine, the rest is in the air 5 km in the sky. 
So, if we use the economical approximation by extensive factor (i.e. on 1 m2 of active surface - $ 0.5 for a double layer of PP mesh), then for a big Air Hydro Power unit, we can estimate the following specific capital costs: 



by average data of passive fog collectors ~ 2 W/m2 -> ~ $ 250/kW 


by maximal data of active fog collectors ~ 50 W/m2 -> ~ $ 10/kW 


by physical calculation on equator ~ 500 W/m2 -> ~ $ 1/kW 


In comparison,



A gas turbine Power plant with ~ $ 500-700/kW for the cost about 5 cents per kWh,


A conventional Terra power plant with ~ $ 1500/kW for ~ 2.5 cents per kWh,


A Hydro Power plant with ~ $ 1000-3000/kW for ~ 0.5 cents per kWh,


A Nuclear Power Plant with ~ $ 5000/kW for ~ 2.5 cents per kWh.

If you are interested in the Feasibility study, please take a look.


8. Main advantages




Huge potential that is much more than all human needs 


Almost world-wide use where there are clouds with water drops 


Can be Used as pumped storage and simultaneously as H2 storage 


Output is electricity, H2, and fresh water, Simultaneously


The possibility to reduce energy costs by 1-2 orders of magnitude


Absolute ecological security from any pollution and CO2 


Saving the climate and ecological balance of the planet 


Technological simplicity, it is not high-tech and can be reproduced easily


At last, it is amazing beautiful! (Especially to scientists like me!)




Air HES in the Media





What we need the money for?

The detailed calculations in the ""Feasibility study"" show that this project can be fantastically beneficial. However to start up this absolutely new revolution in energy, an investors will be the main support. This is why we are launching our IndieGoGo campaign. In order to build a fully functional working prototype scaled up enough for constant water and energy output. This will encourage investors to take the project to phase two.

We had tested the first scientific prototype last summer (2013/07/30) in Russia through our own funding (~$3k). We suppose that we have gotten approximately 5 liter/m2 per hour (by analyzing the aerostat positions). The water collector proved that we had collected water but the rope holding AirHES broke and exact figures were not obtained. 




Now we are going to build another prototype that we could test as a real device for any possible estimates and conditions. You can see in the feasibility study down below that the target sum matches the estimation of the possible total cost of this minimal technical prototype. In other words, we need about $14,052 to make a scaled-up version of AirHES.




We are sure on 99% that we can demonstrate a workable prototype for attracting investors and further developing this project as business.

And most importantly: 
This may be the most important project in the History that will forever solve the basic problems of mankind (except stupidity, of course) and will provide participants immortality in the memory of posterity in row of the most famous names. Ultimately, all that a man does - is an attempt to earn a piece of immortality in the form of memory at least through their descendants, at least temporarily. But here it is, the eternal memory for all generations of all humanity... So, you will help us go down in history, as the generation that saved the planet. 
Stretch Goal
If we could get ~ $100k from this campaign we could start up this project even without an external investor. Then we will try to start by producing simple devices for fresh water supply (like a portable kite SKY-FOUNTAIN, etc.) and step-by-step to develop our devices for getting energy, hydrogen, and water... We are sure the idea will succeed, and with your help... We can do it!
And, of course, anybody who want can start the same project independently... We will be only glad if anybody will get the result faster and better us - it is a global problem and we will not struggle for priority or market... 


Also we need everyone to help us spread the word about this campaign!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I began breeding naturally colored organic cotton in 1982 while working for a genius of a plant breeder who had a bagful of seeds that the USDA had given to his daughter-in-law. They were supposed to be pest resistant and were from the Cajun people in Louisiana (who had gotten them from former slaves who had grown them in their gardens). The lint was short and coarse and a luscious color of brown. I wanted to work with these gorgeous cottons, but the breeder said that there was no market and that I could make a market for this cotton myself- on my own time. Which is what I began to do. But first I had to get dependable color on fiber that was easier to spin. So I started by handspinning the fiber around each seed and planting (in pots) those that were the easiest to spin and the nicest in color. I cross pollinated the flowers from these with white cottons that had lovely lint and planted those seeds and made selections year after year. Taking these pots with me through a variety of jobs until I finally had too many seeds for pots and needed to rent land.</p>
<p>By 1990 I had developed dependable varieties of naturally colored cottons that could be machine spun and organically grown. My first mill customer was a fine spinning mill in Japan, I then began working with designers in the US and Europe and soon began selling to mills all over the world. The market grew too quickly and within five years it peaked and then painfully collapsed. This coincided with the decline of the US textile industry. The textile industries in the countries that had environmental regulations were decimated by products that came from countries were regulations on textile waste were either nonexistent or not enforced. The mills that I was selling to could not compete and closed. </p>
<p>I was left with my seeds and a lovely organic farm in the Capay Valley and one last mill in Japan to sell my cotton to. And my mail order yarn business (Vreseis Ltd <a href=""http://www.vreseis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vreseis.com</a>) for whom I kept research scale yarn processing active.</p>
<p>This year I have decided to get my breeding program up and running again. I want the work I began with these plants over 30 years ago to survive. The success of growing the cotton for profit has been so minimal this past decade that it has not been sufficient to support the breeding program. </p>
<p>Start up costs have been greater than I expected.</p>
<p>I had to modify my cultivation equipment and repair my tractor. I have had to pay weeding crews more that I expected to. I cannot work any harder than I have been. I need help and I need the money to pay for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Getting my farm equipment up and running again was more costly than I had expected. The weeds worse than I imagined...cost overruns on getting the old John Deere 4010 running again were ~$8000. New gangs of discs on my cultivator required for the bindweed wrapped around the young cotton plants ran an extra $3000, plus mounting. Hand cultivation is taking longer than expected and more than I can do myself. An extra $9000 for that. And so it goes.</p>
<p>I would love to have enough money to put in an small single stand gin, but that will be another fundraising effort. </p>
<p>Any funds raised will help me pay for the gang of discs and the extra hand weeding crews's pay. </p>
<p>The perks are all things that I grow (biodynamically) and process. The wheat is phenomenal- I normally sell it as a whole grain, but will grind it up on my little stone mill (extra fine grind). The socks are a tradition- they have been made out of my cotton since the early 90's entirely in the USA. The yarn is soft, yet does not pill and can be (naturally) dyed if you pick lighter colors. Take a look in the gallery to see pictures of some of the perks.</p>

I began breeding naturally colored organic cotton in 1982 while working for a genius of a plant breeder who had a bagful of seeds that the USDA had given to his daughter-in-law. They were supposed to be pest resistant and were from the Cajun people in Louisiana (who had gotten them from former slaves who had grown them in their gardens). The lint was short and coarse and a luscious color of brown. I wanted to work with these gorgeous cottons, but the breeder said that there was no market and that I could make a market for this cotton myself- on my own time. Which is what I began to do. But first I had to get dependable color on fiber that was easier to spin. So I started by handspinning the fiber around each seed and planting (in pots) those that were the easiest to spin and the nicest in color. I cross pollinated the flowers from these with white cottons that had lovely lint and planted those seeds and made selections year after year. Taking these pots with me through a variety of jobs until I finally had too many seeds for pots and needed to rent land.
By 1990 I had developed dependable varieties of naturally colored cottons that could be machine spun and organically grown. My first mill customer was a fine spinning mill in Japan, I then began working with designers in the US and Europe and soon began selling to mills all over the world. The market grew too quickly and within five years it peaked and then painfully collapsed. This coincided with the decline of the US textile industry. The textile industries in the countries that had environmental regulations were decimated by products that came from countries were regulations on textile waste were either nonexistent or not enforced. The mills that I was selling to could not compete and closed. 
I was left with my seeds and a lovely organic farm in the Capay Valley and one last mill in Japan to sell my cotton to. And my mail order yarn business (Vreseis Ltd www.vreseis.com) for whom I kept research scale yarn processing active.
This year I have decided to get my breeding program up and running again. I want the work I began with these plants over 30 years ago to survive. The success of growing the cotton for profit has been so minimal this past decade that it has not been sufficient to support the breeding program. 
Start up costs have been greater than I expected.
I had to modify my cultivation equipment and repair my tractor. I have had to pay weeding crews more that I expected to. I cannot work any harder than I have been. I need help and I need the money to pay for it.
 
 


What We Need & What You Get
Getting my farm equipment up and running again was more costly than I had expected. The weeds worse than I imagined...cost overruns on getting the old John Deere 4010 running again were ~$8000. New gangs of discs on my cultivator required for the bindweed wrapped around the young cotton plants ran an extra $3000, plus mounting. Hand cultivation is taking longer than expected and more than I can do myself. An extra $9000 for that. And so it goes.
I would love to have enough money to put in an small single stand gin, but that will be another fundraising effort. 
Any funds raised will help me pay for the gang of discs and the extra hand weeding crews's pay. 
The perks are all things that I grow (biodynamically) and process. The wheat is phenomenal- I normally sell it as a whole grain, but will grind it up on my little stone mill (extra fine grind). The socks are a tradition- they have been made out of my cotton since the early 90's entirely in the USA. The yarn is soft, yet does not pill and can be (naturally) dyed if you pick lighter colors. Take a look in the gallery to see pictures of some of the perks.

Indian auto rickshaws produce a lot of pollution, they’re not very powerful and they’re very noisy. But the auto rickshaw is very important to Indians. They’re everywhere and are a critical part of the Indian economy.<div>
<br/><h1> A Typical Rickshaw Driver.</h1>
<p>Ashok is a typical Rickshaw driver. He works 14 hours a day, spends most his income on gas, deals with frequent breaks downs, and breathes polluted air.</p>
If Ashok had an electric Rickshaw he could stop wasting money on gas, drive faster with more power, he wouldn’t break down all the time so he would spend less money at the mechanic. And no emissions at all. Ashok would no longer be a source of air pollution. </div>
<div>Zero emissions.<br/><br/><strong>Why not buy a new electric auto rickshaw?</strong><br/><p>The problem is electric rickshaws are four times the price of Ashok’s rickshaw, they don’t go very far, built out of delicate, lightweight materials, almost nobody knows how to fix them, and so there are no parts anywhere. And worst of all Ashok would spend more time waiting for the vehicle to recharge than actually driving it.</p>
<p>And frankly, Ashok told us he doesn't want to buy a new rickshaw. We asked. Yes, Ashok is a real live person. Fund this project and we will post videos of the actual Ashok.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162375/files/20131029162033-Electric_Rickshaw_Still.bmp?1383088833"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p>Here is an example of an electric rickshaw that is in production by a European Manufacturer. It weighs 119 pounds less than existing gas vehicles, takes hours to recharge, can drive 50 km before it dies and is four time the price of a gas vehicle. How can an Indian rickshaw driver earning 5 dollars a day ever afford it? How can he afford to recharge for six hours? What happens when the vehicle dies and he’s nowhere near a recharge facility? Who would know how to fix it?</p>
<br/><h1>The Solution.</h1>
What if Ashok could keep his existing rickshaw? We would drop in an electric motor. No charge. We would provide the battery also. No charge there either. Everything in his life remains the same. Except now he has a powerful motor that doesn’t break down. Ashok would only pay for the power he used.<br/>
The money we make selling power will pay for the batteries and many more conversion kits. As new battery technology comes out we’ll deploy that too.<br/><h1>The Technology.</h1>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162377/files/20131029162111-High_Density_Battery_fixed.bmp?1383088871"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>But Ashok can’t afford one. Even if he could it takes special equipment to recharge them. Instead Askhok can drop in to one of our local Hot Swap shops. In seconds we’ll slide out Ashok’s old battery and slide in a fully charged replacement. We can then service and recharge the battery using clean energy and doing our best to stay off India’s power grid. We effectively replace the gas station.</p>
Some of you are wondering about the conversion kit. Here are the parts involved in our prototype kits.

<br/><p><strong>The conversion kit includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>48 volt, 5KW (6.7 HP) electric motor. 30AH, 37 pounds.</strong> A very powerful motor that consistently generates 6.7 HP regardless of the rotational speed of the the motor. Ashok will love the feeling of responsive power from this motor.</li>
<li> <strong>Motor controller.</strong>This is the microprocessor that controls the motor.</li>
<li> <strong>Foot Throttle</strong>. To accelerate /decelerate.</li>
<li> <strong>Cables / ""Fuel"" Gauge</strong>. Ashok needs to know when he's almost out of power.</li>
<li> <strong>Differential Gear Box</strong>. This is needed to couple the motor to the rear axle. The existing gear box wont work. This also allows us to fit the kit on various rickshaw types and models.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Business Model.</h1>
If we pay full retail price a conversion costs $1,057. As we buy volume from our manufacturers in China the costs drop quite a bit.  
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162392/files/20131029162830-Conversion_Kit_Pricing.png?1383089310"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
When you fund our Indiegogo we can buy kits for $536. <br/><p>Our first goal is to convert 400 auto rickshaws and install 4 hot swap shops in Ahmednagar, the city where we live.</p>
<h1>Hot Swap Shops.</h1>
<p> We make money by selling power. Special equipment is needed to recharge the batteries. Drivers must sign a contract agreeing to never attempt to recharge the battery. Not including regenerative breaking, each battery lasts 30 amp hours or 4 to 5 days of normal use. The cost to recharge a battery is 32 rupees.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162396/files/20131029162852-Recharge_Revenue_2.png?1383089332"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>30 Ah x 48 V / 1000 = 4.7 kWh</li>
<li>12 cents x 4.7 = 56 cents to recharge in the US.</li>
<li>6.85 INR x 4.7 = 32 rupees to recharge on the power grid in India</li>
</ul>
<p>With the profits wegeneratefrom the sale of power (""Hot Swaps"") we will install solar and fuel cells in the hot swap shops. This will provide clean energy that is independent of India's power grid. Once we get the first town converted we will have an excellent working model from which we can solicit large private venture capital.</p>
In the beginning we plan to charge 300 rupees for a hot swap, about five dollars. At this rate it will take under 200 swaps to break even, depending on the pricing we get. Profit per battery in circulation runs around 4,500 dollars. We can use that profit to convert more rickshaws in more cities around India.<br/><div class=""template asset"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162397/files/20131029162929-Recharge-Revenue.png?1383089369"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
With economies of scale, solar cell recharging and in-country manufacturing our costs can decrease much further. Once we have our first city running on electric power we can solicit much bigger funds from private firms and governments.<br/><strong>Why we succeed.</strong><br/><p>We know Ashok and many others like him. We know his life, his family pressures, his economic struggles. We live down the street from Ashok and many just like him. We simply asked him: what do you want? Ashok told us. We built what he asked for. We stand by Ashok. We stand by our conversions, our Hot Swap Shops, our staff and our service centers.</p>
<br/><h1>Government Incentives.</h1>
<p>After we convert our first city we will scale our system up to serve more cities throughout India. We will need to start manufacturing our own kits instead of buying them from third parties.</p>
<p>The government of India will provide incentives for every three wheeled vehicle converted. The incentives are enough to cover the cost of future kits we manufacture, but they require at least 30 percent of the parts to be manufactured in India.</p>
<h1>Our Rewards.</h1>
<p>Funding our Indiegogo project will create a new transportation model that has the potential to stop more than a million gas engines from polluting the earth. You are also dramatically improving the life of a driver, his family, and the community where they live. 
</p>
<p> We have created meaningful incentives at every donation level.   We set this goal at the amount required to convert an entire city to electric auto rickshaws. Once we get our first pilot city converted we will be in a strong position to convert many, many more. Our ultimate goal is to convert one million auto rickshaws in India.</p>
<p>  On behalf of rickshaw drivers, India and a better future for everyone I ask that you login and donate today. The faster we reach this goal the faster I can get the parts ordered and shipped. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past 40 years, Rhino populations have suffered a 90% decline.  In Kruger National Park alone, 425 rhinos were poached in 2012, and this number has nearly doubled in 2013 as of printing time.  This kill rate is nearing parity with the birth rate, making extinction a grave concern.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>

<i>Source: Lowveld Rhino Trust</i><br/><p></p>
<p>Compounding this problem, the poaching arrest rate is only about 5% due to the extensive poacher networks, and their increasing sophistication.  Park Rangers are in desperate need of a force multiplier, which is where the UAV system comes into play.  <br/></p>

<h3>More Details about the causal problem...<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p>
<p>Demand for
goods made from rhinoceros horns has skyrocketed in South East Asia and China
over the last 6 years due to a rapidly rising middle class in those economies.
At the root of the rhino crisis is the use of rhino horn in traditional Chinese
medicine to treat fever, pain, rheumatism, cancer, erectile dysfunction and
convulsions. Rhino horn is highly sought after in China and more importantly in
Vietnam, despite the fact that rhino horn has been extensively analyzed scientifically
and offers no medicinal properties. Nevertheless, claims of the medicinal value
of these products are broadcast by profit-seekers. Rhino horn is comprised of
keratin, the same material as human hair and finger/toe nails. In addition,
rhino horn is a recreational drug in Vietnam and used by the middle class as a
detoxifying beverage and body-rejuvenating tonic. To satisfy this demand,
poaching in places like Kruger National Park in South Africa is rampant with
captured rhinos killed and left to rot for nothing more than their horns. Many
countries in Africa suffer from poaching. The following map shows poaching
areas and market areas for the Rhino horns.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269548/files/20131219081148-RhinoHrnTradeRt.jpg?1387469508"" src="""" style=""width: 346.775px; height: 261px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Rhino horn trade route</p>
<p>Until now
many countries in Asia lacked legislation to prevent legal import of these
goods. Only recently have the Chinese and Vietnamese governments implemented
new laws against the import of rhino and elephant products but the question
remains how quickly these laws will take effect in a flourishing black market. And
more importantly when will the people in these cultures realize the
irreversible damage caused by poaching rhinos is not worth their carved ornamental
artifacts of no use or the ineffective traditional medicine based on horn
material. The syndicated black market continues to supply the demands by the
nouveau-riche until those people change their philosophies. </p>
<p>Colonel Bobelo
(SAM) says that it became increasingly important utilize in the army when
syndicates began using helicopters, night vision equipment and high-powered
rifles in their hunts. Rangers on the ground are ill equipped to stop the poachers,
often outnumbered and out-gunned by a criminal network that invests in
technology and intelligence to ensure their access to the rhinos. The
deployment of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members at the
Kruger National Park has brought confidence that Rangers can regain control, at
least to some degree. The SANDF deployed 265 soldiers at Kruger National Park
and the borders around the park in March 2013, following a plea for help by the
South African National Parks (SanParks).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Until 2007 the
poaching was limited. Since 2008 there was a rapid, exponential increase in
poaching. Poaching became a year round activity. Poaching is considered to be a
“low risk - high reward” activity by the poachers, for reasons discussed below.
In recent years poachers use darting guns and veterinary drugs to immobilize
the rhino. Darting guns are silent and prevent detection by patrols. With axes
and/or motor saws, without veterinary knowledge that might give the animal a
chance of survival, poachers cut off the horn anyway they can as it must be
done very quickly in order to retreat fast. In some cases they tranquilize the
animals and mutilate it so much that it cannot survive in the wild, leaving
them to die a horrible death. In other cases they simply kill the animal. </p>
<p>The poachers
that come from other countries, particularly Mozambique, are armed with AK47s,
grenades, chain saws, axes; GPS, night vision, and sometimes helicopters. They
don't play, these poachers mean business. Many of the poachers are former Mozambican
soldiers and are well trained to fight. They often use “tourists” in the Parks
who join Ranger patrols to have the rangers guide them to locations of Rhinos.
They transmit the GPS data to their command center that then dispatches the
poachers, primarily during cover of night. </p>
<p>Examples of
poached animals are shown below. They were recent events on the ranch of John
and Albina Hume. Images show how reckless the poachers are in removing the horn
and how traumatic it is for the animals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269564/files/20131219081701-Poached1.jpg?1387469821"" src="""" style=""width: 196.881px; height: 148px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269566/files/20131219081750-Poached3.jpg?1387469870"" src="""" style=""width: 111.339px; height: 148px;""/></p>

<p>Shown below
is another example of a Rhino that survived the poaching act; but only for a
short time! It did not survive the event very long because of the severity of
the wounds. If the animals survive poaching they are often euthanized by
Rangers to stop their incredible suffering.</p>

<p>While a
rhino horn price in 2006 was just $1000 for 1 kg (2.2 lbs.), today one kg of
rhino horn has an average market value of about $80,000. Poachers often get
around ZAR1 million (~$100,000) for one horn of about 4 kg (8.8 lbs.). Black
market prices vary widely; as of last fall 2012 dealers in Vietnam quoted
prices ranging from $33 to $133 a gram (0.002 lbs.) ($80 on average), which at
the top end is higher than the price of gold (~$47/gram on 10/26/2013) and
exceeds the price of cocaine in most locations including New York City. </p>
<p>The poacher
who is going to shoot the rhino reportedly gets R500,000 (~$50,000) from
syndicated criminals, the one with an axe and the third one get R250,000
($25,000) each. Some of the poachers are young unemployed South African men
driven by poverty and lured by foreign syndicates to do the dirty job in
exchange for very attractive amounts of money. These would-be poachers get a
deposit from the syndicates before they carry out the job within a given time
frame. Given their limited understanding of that money, they often spend the
money before having the horn. As their customers are associated with global
organized crime syndicates, the promise to come back with the rhino horn must
be fulfilled at all costs, or else they are in big trouble to repay their debt!
This means that there is also a major socio-economic problem linked to
poaching.</p>
<p>In recent
time poachers commanded by syndicates operate in flash mobs. Multiple groups
enter the park at the same time in small groups. Reports mention that up to 300
poachers were roaming in KNP at one given time. </p>
<p>Park rangers
are up against well-armed crime syndicates which use funds from poaching for
terrorist activities.<span>  For example,
Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group aligned with al Qaeda, is raking in about
$650,000 a month on the black market from poaching, according to England's
Daily Express. Thus the US government announced a $1M reward for information
leading to the dismantling of some syndicates, primarily operating from Laos (</span><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/world/asia/us-to-offer-reward-in-wildlife-trafficking-fight.html?ref=earth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/world/asia/us-to-offer-reward-in-wildlife-trafficking-fight.html?ref=earth</a>) as reported by the New York Times.</p>

The
fight against poaching has several stages as depicted in the following sketch.
The Rangers are pursuing the poachers in order to prevent the killing. Once the
poacher gets past that line of defense and leave KNP into Mozambique, middlemen
smuggle the horns out of that country to end-markets<span>  Customs officials have some capability to
detect the smuggle ware, but these horns do not usually enter the destination
countries via conventional, legal routes. In the receiving country, there are
the syndicated middlemen who distribute the horns to small back alley shops
where they are prepared for the final market, primarily the nouveau riche
middle class in emerging Asian countries (e.g. Vietnam and China).</span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269573/files/20131219082341-PoachPathways.jpg?1387470221"" src="""" style=""width: 466.762px; height: 169px;""/></p>
<p>Path way of illegal trade. Interceptions are possible at each interface.</p>
<p>And perhaps
there is corruption involved in the entire trade. It appears that criminal
syndicates have infiltrated the law enforcement and justice systems of South
Africa. If an arrest is made, it happens often that filed papers are
mysteriously lost. Once the dockets have gone missing, the case is over and the
suspects are released. These organized criminals have systematically reduced
their risk of breaking important conservation and humane rulings.<span>  They have had the upper hand long enough – it
is time for a surge in protecting forces. It is quite seriously
“one-minute-to-midnight” in the war against poaching! Due to the significant
money some rangers now participate in the poaching as well. On February 2012
four rangers of KNP were arrested on suspicion of poaching rhinos they are
tasked to protect.</span> (<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-safrica-rhinos-idUSTRE81S0UK20120229"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-sa...</a>).</p>
<h3>Preventive Efforts<br/>
</h3>
<p>Rangers have
often gone into the Kruger National Park to dehorn Rhinos that roam very close
to the Mozambique border. This is a measure to protect the animal from being
killed, as it devalues the animal as a poaching target. These operations are
done by veterinarians who know how to dehorn a Rhino without harm. The horn
will grow back in several years. The Rhino will be less protected against lion
attacks, but still very capable to defend itself vigorously. It would be much
better not to have this kind of need for animal protection! Often the poachers
even kill for a stump.</p>

<br/><br/><h3>Kruger National Park<br/>
</h3>
<p>Poaching is
not limited to the nation of South Africa. Many African Nations, like Kenya,
have major problems as shown in the table below. Much of the poaching is also
done in provincial and private parks in South Africa. However, Kruger National
Park (KNP) is the most severely poached park as bordering with Mozambique. The
Southern White Rhino – 20165 surviving, are under huge pressure of poaching as
the Black Rhino has a population of less than 5000. After declared extinct in
2006, protection has given them a chance to recover. Our project will focus on
the Rhino poaching in (KNP) in South Africa
where the white rhino roams. But the technology could serve everywhere to help
Rangers stop poaching and animal.</p>
<p>The park lies in the north-east of South Africa. It is one of the largest
national parks in the world, with an area of 19,485 square kilometers (~7,580
sq miles); larger than Connecticut and a tiny bit smaller than New Jersey. KNP
is approximately 360 kilometers (220 miles) long, and has an average width of
65 kilometers (40 miles). At its widest point, the park is 90 kilometers (56 miles)
wide from east to west. To the north and south of the park two rivers, the
Limpopo and the Crocodile respectively, act as its natural boundaries. To the
east the Lebombo Mountains separate it from Mozambique the 14<sup>th</sup>
poorest nation in Africa in 2013 (Financenews).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269603/files/20131219083923-Map1.jpg?1387471163"" src="""" style=""width: 259.855px; height: 243px;""/></p>Source: Google Maps<br/><br/><p>The park varies in
altitude between 200 m in the east and 840 m in the south-west near
Berg-en-Dal. The highest point in the park is a hill called Khandzalive.
Several rivers run through the park from west to east, including the Sabie,
Olifants, Crocodile, Letaba, Luvuvhu and Limpopo Rivers; waterways that get also
used as rhinos seek waterways.</p>

The
climate of the Kruger National Park is subtropical. Summer days are humid and
hot with temperatures often soaring to above 38 °C (100 °F). The rainy season
is from September until May. September and October are the driest periods, culminating
in rains late in October.
<br/><br/><h3>Poaching Statistics<br/>
</h3>
<p>The statistics of poaching show an
increasing number of Rhino poaching events. Below are recent graphs that show
the development of the poaching problem and visualize the exponential growth of
the poaching. The current concern is that the poaching kills are exceeding the
birth rate of rhinos; which is an undisputable warning sign that the extinction
of rhinos is becoming a real concern.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269606/files/20131219084225-Stats1.jpg?1387471345"" src="""" style=""width: 270.009px; height: 242px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Data source: Lowveld Rhino Trust; <a href=""http://lowveldrhinotrust.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lowveldrhinotrust.org/</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately the arrests made by the
Rangers have, at best, remained constant and in some cases have even declined over
the years. This trend has reversed a little since the military joined the
rangers in the war against poachers. Of
the 425 poached Rhinos in Kruger National Park in 2012 only 73 poachers were
arrested. Considering that the poaching teams are often 3 to 6 men, this means
only about 10-15 events were caught. That is an anti-poaching “success” rate of
less than 5%! Thus poachers see their effort as a very low risk undertaking and
very lucrative effort. </p>
<p>In 2013 the number of poached Rhinos in
South Africa has dramatically increased to 408 in the first 6 months. At this
point the numbers exceed 2 Rhinos per day in the “summer” season. KNP takes the
brunt of poaching with 265 animals, most of which are killed in the process.
The rangers, with support of the SA military, recently improved their success
with intelligence driven operations to arrest 56 poachers in that time frame. However,
not all were convicted as files got mysteriously lost in transition.The current (20 November) number of poached
rhinos for 2013 stands at 859 and the total arrests stands at 165 (67 in KNP).
Assuming teams of 3 poachers per rhino, we compute an arrest rate of ~7%; a
slight improvement, possibly due to the involvement of Army soldiers supporting
the rangers. However for KNP the arrest rate decreased to 4.7%. In addition it
is a war: since 2006 some 22 poachers were gunned down. But rangers are killed
as well, often being outgunned by the poachers.</p>

Rhino poaching has dealt
South Africa a financial loss of about ZAR228 million (~$23M) with the 333
rhinos poached last year alone. These are the statistics according to the
Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA); it is for this financial
reason and the need to protect rhinos that the country is going all out to
counter poachers.

<h3>The Challenge &amp; Competition<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The national Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge is composed
of four phases or milestones. </p>
<p><b>Concept – By January 31, 2014</b></p>
<p>Team proposes a concept aircraft with communications,
sensors, and embedded systems. </p>
<p>The global team will be developed with
graduate students from the Universities of Colorado, Stuttgart, Pretoria and
Helsinki. International teams of students have select knowledge to augment
Colorado’s team skills. A graduate design course starting in Spring semester
2014, followed by a summer semester course and a Fall semester course is the
framework for this educational project. Volunteers
are working with the international team to prepare this milestone before design
course begins in January 2014.</p>
<p><b>Build &amp; Fly – By April 30, 2014</b></p>
<p>The global team shall design, build, and
fly their aircraft and demonstrate airworthiness, communications, and safety at
a local flying field. The deliverable includes a short video documenting Build
&amp; Fly (MP4 File Type). </p>
<p><b>Design Report – By June 30, 2014</b></p>
<p>The teams shall submit a written Design
Report to the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge (<a href=""http://www.wcuavc.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wcuavc.com/home.html</a> ). The report includes a description of hardware
and software for avionics and embedded systems and demonstrated flight performance.
Design reports submitted by all competing teams will be evaluated. Teams will
receive recognition for best airframe, best avionics, and best embedded
systems.</p>
<p>The teams awarded the highest points will
be approved for the next phase of the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge which
is the Challenge Flight.</p>
<p><b>Challenge Flight – August 30, 2014</b></p>
<p>Teams shall compete in the Challenge
Flight scenario defined by the challenge organizers. The Challenge will involve
a mission profile that includes launch within a time window, climb to
operational altitude of 300 feet above ground level (AGL), transit to several
GPS way-points, collection of video and RFID tag data, on board processing,
communications, return to base, and recovery.</p>
<p>Specific details of the challenge
scenario will not be released until the morning of the competition: teams will
need to be prepared to adjust flight profiles, sensor parameters, and data
processing as needed.</p>
<p><b>Kruger Mission – Fall semester 2014. Date
to be Determined</b></p>
<p>The winning team will participate in a
safari and counter-poaching mission in Kruger National Park. The mission will
include several days of demonstrations and operational flights. Sponsoring
companies also can bring equipment to Kruger for demonstrations.</p>
<p>The Hyperion team, with its global
partners, is seeking funding to position itself to develop the ultimate
anti-poaching UAV and thus make a historical contribution to a successful fight
against rhino poaching and finish as the winning team of the competition. </p>
<p><b>Long
Live The Rhino!</b></p>

An international student team (Team AREND) is collaborating to compete in the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge - to design, build & fly an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to support anti-poaching operations in South Africa.  This student team is led by Dr. Jean Koster at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and includes teams from Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, University of Pretoria SA, and the University of Stuttgart.Also collaborating with and supporting / sponsoring this student team is Wildlife Protection Solutions, Helios Torque Fusion, Inc, and NIST - the National Institute for Standards and Technology.  Wildlife Protection Solutions (WPS) is an international non-profit group dedicated
    to the conservation of endangered species.  Their current focus is on the five species
    of rhinos world-wide, with a special emphasis on creating habitat and breeding programs
    that will allow rhino populations to grow faster than they are being poached.  Helios Torque Fusion, Inc. is a Colorado-based business working to commercialize hybrid-electric propulsion systems for UAVs, making the aircraft more fuel-efficient and quieter - both important for wildlife monitoring & protection.
Our video was produced by Ben Fraser and the Denver Zoo graciously provided the appropriate backdrop.



What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise nearly $200,000 to support the project in these areas of development:

Aircraft construction materials, fuselage & wing components, control surfaces and so forth,
Sponsored research with the University teams for use of mechanical and electronic shops, machinists, technicians, and administrative personnel,
Hybrid-electric engine development, balancing long-endurance capabilities with fuel efficiency and low noise,
Trade studies of military-grade sensor packages to detect animals and threats
Team travel for flight testing and site visits, and other documentation and administration as required for aircraft operations.


All contributions will be received by Wildlife Protection Solutions, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and qualify as charitable contributions.  Additionally, every donor will receive memorabilia and recognition for their contributions to the effort - see perk details for more information about donation levels, and what the benefits are for various levels of donation.



The Impact
In the past 40 years, Rhino populations have suffered a 90% decline.  In Kruger National Park alone, 425 rhinos were poached in 2012, and this number has nearly doubled in 2013 as of printing time.  This kill rate is nearing parity with the birth rate, making extinction a grave concern.


Source: Lowveld Rhino Trust
Compounding this problem, the poaching arrest rate is only about 5% due to the extensive poacher networks, and their increasing sophistication.  Park Rangers are in desperate need of a force multiplier, which is where the UAV system comes into play.

About the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge
In response to President Obama's Executive Order on Combating Wildlife Trafficking, Princess Aliyah, the Reserve Protection Agency, and Global Unmanned Systems initiated the worldwide Wildlife Conservation unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Challenge to foster innovation and invention in the design, fabrication, and utilization of unmanned aircraft to assist with counter-poaching and illicit wildlife trafficking.  It calls on students, hobbyists, academics and corporations to sooperate in a design, build, fly & compute challenge that emphasizes the integration of sensors, embedded systems, and communications in a robust and high-endurance aircraft.Princess Aliyah created Kashmir-Robotics as a division of the Al-Kareem Foundation to ensure the best possible aircraft and ground robots are integrated with anti-poaching systems to help protect endangered species.
Please note that this fundraising campaign is specifically to support a team participating in the competition, and not the competition itself.  More info about the challenge can be found here: www.wcuavc.com

More Details about the causal problem...




Demand for
goods made from rhinoceros horns has skyrocketed in South East Asia and China
over the last 6 years due to a rapidly rising middle class in those economies.
At the root of the rhino crisis is the use of rhino horn in traditional Chinese
medicine to treat fever, pain, rheumatism, cancer, erectile dysfunction and
convulsions. Rhino horn is highly sought after in China and more importantly in
Vietnam, despite the fact that rhino horn has been extensively analyzed scientifically
and offers no medicinal properties. Nevertheless, claims of the medicinal value
of these products are broadcast by profit-seekers. Rhino horn is comprised of
keratin, the same material as human hair and finger/toe nails. In addition,
rhino horn is a recreational drug in Vietnam and used by the middle class as a
detoxifying beverage and body-rejuvenating tonic. To satisfy this demand,
poaching in places like Kruger National Park in South Africa is rampant with
captured rhinos killed and left to rot for nothing more than their horns. Many
countries in Africa suffer from poaching. The following map shows poaching
areas and market areas for the Rhino horns.



Rhino horn trade route
Until now
many countries in Asia lacked legislation to prevent legal import of these
goods. Only recently have the Chinese and Vietnamese governments implemented
new laws against the import of rhino and elephant products but the question
remains how quickly these laws will take effect in a flourishing black market. And
more importantly when will the people in these cultures realize the
irreversible damage caused by poaching rhinos is not worth their carved ornamental
artifacts of no use or the ineffective traditional medicine based on horn
material. The syndicated black market continues to supply the demands by the
nouveau-riche until those people change their philosophies. 
Colonel Bobelo
(SAM) says that it became increasingly important utilize in the army when
syndicates began using helicopters, night vision equipment and high-powered
rifles in their hunts. Rangers on the ground are ill equipped to stop the poachers,
often outnumbered and out-gunned by a criminal network that invests in
technology and intelligence to ensure their access to the rhinos. The
deployment of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) members at the
Kruger National Park has brought confidence that Rangers can regain control, at
least to some degree. The SANDF deployed 265 soldiers at Kruger National Park
and the borders around the park in March 2013, following a plea for help by the
South African National Parks (SanParks).


Until 2007 the
poaching was limited. Since 2008 there was a rapid, exponential increase in
poaching. Poaching became a year round activity. Poaching is considered to be a
“low risk - high reward” activity by the poachers, for reasons discussed below.
In recent years poachers use darting guns and veterinary drugs to immobilize
the rhino. Darting guns are silent and prevent detection by patrols. With axes
and/or motor saws, without veterinary knowledge that might give the animal a
chance of survival, poachers cut off the horn anyway they can as it must be
done very quickly in order to retreat fast. In some cases they tranquilize the
animals and mutilate it so much that it cannot survive in the wild, leaving
them to die a horrible death. In other cases they simply kill the animal. 
The poachers
that come from other countries, particularly Mozambique, are armed with AK47s,
grenades, chain saws, axes; GPS, night vision, and sometimes helicopters. They
don't play, these poachers mean business. Many of the poachers are former Mozambican
soldiers and are well trained to fight. They often use “tourists” in the Parks
who join Ranger patrols to have the rangers guide them to locations of Rhinos.
They transmit the GPS data to their command center that then dispatches the
poachers, primarily during cover of night. 
Examples of
poached animals are shown below. They were recent events on the ranch of John
and Albina Hume. Images show how reckless the poachers are in removing the horn
and how traumatic it is for the animals.

Pretoria)
Shown below
is another example of a Rhino that survived the poaching act; but only for a
short time! It did not survive the event very long because of the severity of
the wounds. If the animals survive poaching they are often euthanized by
Rangers to stop their incredible suffering.

While a
rhino horn price in 2006 was just $1000 for 1 kg (2.2 lbs.), today one kg of
rhino horn has an average market value of about $80,000. Poachers often get
around ZAR1 million (~$100,000) for one horn of about 4 kg (8.8 lbs.). Black
market prices vary widely; as of last fall 2012 dealers in Vietnam quoted
prices ranging from $33 to $133 a gram (0.002 lbs.) ($80 on average), which at
the top end is higher than the price of gold (~$47/gram on 10/26/2013) and
exceeds the price of cocaine in most locations including New York City. 
The poacher
who is going to shoot the rhino reportedly gets R500,000 (~$50,000) from
syndicated criminals, the one with an axe and the third one get R250,000
($25,000) each. Some of the poachers are young unemployed South African men
driven by poverty and lured by foreign syndicates to do the dirty job in
exchange for very attractive amounts of money. These would-be poachers get a
deposit from the syndicates before they carry out the job within a given time
frame. Given their limited understanding of that money, they often spend the
money before having the horn. As their customers are associated with global
organized crime syndicates, the promise to come back with the rhino horn must
be fulfilled at all costs, or else they are in big trouble to repay their debt!
This means that there is also a major socio-economic problem linked to
poaching.
In recent
time poachers commanded by syndicates operate in flash mobs. Multiple groups
enter the park at the same time in small groups. Reports mention that up to 300
poachers were roaming in KNP at one given time. 
Park rangers
are up against well-armed crime syndicates which use funds from poaching for
terrorist activities.  For example,
Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group aligned with al Qaeda, is raking in about
$650,000 a month on the black market from poaching, according to England's
Daily Express. Thus the US government announced a $1M reward for information
leading to the dismantling of some syndicates, primarily operating from Laos (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/world/asia/us-to-offer-reward-in-wildlife-trafficking-fight.html?ref=earth) as reported by the New York Times.

The
fight against poaching has several stages as depicted in the following sketch.
The Rangers are pursuing the poachers in order to prevent the killing. Once the
poacher gets past that line of defense and leave KNP into Mozambique, middlemen
smuggle the horns out of that country to end-markets  Customs officials have some capability to
detect the smuggle ware, but these horns do not usually enter the destination
countries via conventional, legal routes. In the receiving country, there are
the syndicated middlemen who distribute the horns to small back alley shops
where they are prepared for the final market, primarily the nouveau riche
middle class in emerging Asian countries (e.g. Vietnam and China).


Path way of illegal trade. Interceptions are possible at each interface.
And perhaps
there is corruption involved in the entire trade. It appears that criminal
syndicates have infiltrated the law enforcement and justice systems of South
Africa. If an arrest is made, it happens often that filed papers are
mysteriously lost. Once the dockets have gone missing, the case is over and the
suspects are released. These organized criminals have systematically reduced
their risk of breaking important conservation and humane rulings.  They have had the upper hand long enough – it
is time for a surge in protecting forces. It is quite seriously
“one-minute-to-midnight” in the war against poaching! Due to the significant
money some rangers now participate in the poaching as well. On February 2012
four rangers of KNP were arrested on suspicion of poaching rhinos they are
tasked to protect. (http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-sa...).
Preventive Efforts

Rangers have
often gone into the Kruger National Park to dehorn Rhinos that roam very close
to the Mozambique border. This is a measure to protect the animal from being
killed, as it devalues the animal as a poaching target. These operations are
done by veterinarians who know how to dehorn a Rhino without harm. The horn
will grow back in several years. The Rhino will be less protected against lion
attacks, but still very capable to defend itself vigorously. It would be much
better not to have this kind of need for animal protection! Often the poachers
even kill for a stump.

Kruger National Park

Poaching is
not limited to the nation of South Africa. Many African Nations, like Kenya,
have major problems as shown in the table below. Much of the poaching is also
done in provincial and private parks in South Africa. However, Kruger National
Park (KNP) is the most severely poached park as bordering with Mozambique. The
Southern White Rhino – 20165 surviving, are under huge pressure of poaching as
the Black Rhino has a population of less than 5000. After declared extinct in
2006, protection has given them a chance to recover. Our project will focus on
the Rhino poaching in (KNP) in South Africa
where the white rhino roams. But the technology could serve everywhere to help
Rangers stop poaching and animal.
The park lies in the north-east of South Africa. It is one of the largest
national parks in the world, with an area of 19,485 square kilometers (~7,580
sq miles); larger than Connecticut and a tiny bit smaller than New Jersey. KNP
is approximately 360 kilometers (220 miles) long, and has an average width of
65 kilometers (40 miles). At its widest point, the park is 90 kilometers (56 miles)
wide from east to west. To the north and south of the park two rivers, the
Limpopo and the Crocodile respectively, act as its natural boundaries. To the
east the Lebombo Mountains separate it from Mozambique the 14th
poorest nation in Africa in 2013 (Financenews).
Source: Google MapsThe park varies in
altitude between 200 m in the east and 840 m in the south-west near
Berg-en-Dal. The highest point in the park is a hill called Khandzalive.
Several rivers run through the park from west to east, including the Sabie,
Olifants, Crocodile, Letaba, Luvuvhu and Limpopo Rivers; waterways that get also
used as rhinos seek waterways.

The
climate of the Kruger National Park is subtropical. Summer days are humid and
hot with temperatures often soaring to above 38 °C (100 °F). The rainy season
is from September until May. September and October are the driest periods, culminating
in rains late in October.
Poaching Statistics

The statistics of poaching show an
increasing number of Rhino poaching events. Below are recent graphs that show
the development of the poaching problem and visualize the exponential growth of
the poaching. The current concern is that the poaching kills are exceeding the
birth rate of rhinos; which is an undisputable warning sign that the extinction
of rhinos is becoming a real concern.

Data source: https://www.environment.gov.za/media/releases/rhinoissue_management_report


Data source: Lowveld Rhino Trust; http://lowveldrhinotrust.org/
Unfortunately the arrests made by the
Rangers have, at best, remained constant and in some cases have even declined over
the years. This trend has reversed a little since the military joined the
rangers in the war against poachers. Of
the 425 poached Rhinos in Kruger National Park in 2012 only 73 poachers were
arrested. Considering that the poaching teams are often 3 to 6 men, this means
only about 10-15 events were caught. That is an anti-poaching “success” rate of
less than 5%! Thus poachers see their effort as a very low risk undertaking and
very lucrative effort. 
In 2013 the number of poached Rhinos in
South Africa has dramatically increased to 408 in the first 6 months. At this
point the numbers exceed 2 Rhinos per day in the “summer” season. KNP takes the
brunt of poaching with 265 animals, most of which are killed in the process.
The rangers, with support of the SA military, recently improved their success
with intelligence driven operations to arrest 56 poachers in that time frame. However,
not all were convicted as files got mysteriously lost in transition.The current (20 November) number of poached
rhinos for 2013 stands at 859 and the total arrests stands at 165 (67 in KNP).
Assuming teams of 3 poachers per rhino, we compute an arrest rate of ~7%; a
slight improvement, possibly due to the involvement of Army soldiers supporting
the rangers. However for KNP the arrest rate decreased to 4.7%. In addition it
is a war: since 2006 some 22 poachers were gunned down. But rangers are killed
as well, often being outgunned by the poachers.

Rhino poaching has dealt
South Africa a financial loss of about ZAR228 million (~$23M) with the 333
rhinos poached last year alone. These are the statistics according to the
Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA); it is for this financial
reason and the need to protect rhinos that the country is going all out to
counter poachers.
Project Rationale

In view of the escalating problem of
wildlife trafficking, President Obama has signed an Executive Order for
Combating Wildlife Trafficking on July 1, 2013: 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/07/01/executive-order-combating-wildlife-trafficking

Now you can be part of the solution! Help
us provide an unmanned aircraft solution that multiplies the Ranger’s forces.The graduate University of Colorado
Boulder team will collaborate with international teams at the Universities of
Pretoria, South Africa; the University of Stuttgart, Germany, Metropolia
University in Helsinki, Finland, the National Institute of Science and
Technology and several industries in developing an aircraft with the
appropriate capabilities; thus you will gain experience in design, project
management, technology transfer, global collaborations, cross-functional and
multi-cultural teamwork, critical design analysis, and business organization in
addition to engineering credit. 
Goal

Conceive,
Design, Implement & Operate a special remotely-piloted aircraft equipped
with distinct sensors, embedded systems, and 3G/4G and TCIP communications in a
robust and high endurance aircraft meeting also acoustic and wilderness
operation requirements. The aircraft will be equipped with a hybrid propulsion
system to satisfy one of the prime requirements of the concept of operations!





Baseline
aircraft: Hyperion

The Challenge & Competition



The national Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge is composed
of four phases or milestones. 
Concept – By January 31, 2014
Team proposes a concept aircraft with communications,
sensors, and embedded systems. 
The global team will be developed with
graduate students from the Universities of Colorado, Stuttgart, Pretoria and
Helsinki. International teams of students have select knowledge to augment
Colorado’s team skills. A graduate design course starting in Spring semester
2014, followed by a summer semester course and a Fall semester course is the
framework for this educational project. Volunteers
are working with the international team to prepare this milestone before design
course begins in January 2014.
Build & Fly – By April 30, 2014
The global team shall design, build, and
fly their aircraft and demonstrate airworthiness, communications, and safety at
a local flying field. The deliverable includes a short video documenting Build
& Fly (MP4 File Type). 
Design Report – By June 30, 2014
The teams shall submit a written Design
Report to the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge (http://www.wcuavc.com/home.html ). The report includes a description of hardware
and software for avionics and embedded systems and demonstrated flight performance.
Design reports submitted by all competing teams will be evaluated. Teams will
receive recognition for best airframe, best avionics, and best embedded
systems.
The teams awarded the highest points will
be approved for the next phase of the Wildlife Conservation UAV Challenge which
is the Challenge Flight.
Challenge Flight – August 30, 2014
Teams shall compete in the Challenge
Flight scenario defined by the challenge organizers. The Challenge will involve
a mission profile that includes launch within a time window, climb to
operational altitude of 300 feet above ground level (AGL), transit to several
GPS way-points, collection of video and RFID tag data, on board processing,
communications, return to base, and recovery.
Specific details of the challenge
scenario will not be released until the morning of the competition: teams will
need to be prepared to adjust flight profiles, sensor parameters, and data
processing as needed.
Kruger Mission – Fall semester 2014. Date
to be Determined
The winning team will participate in a
safari and counter-poaching mission in Kruger National Park. The mission will
include several days of demonstrations and operational flights. Sponsoring
companies also can bring equipment to Kruger for demonstrations.
The Hyperion team, with its global
partners, is seeking funding to position itself to develop the ultimate
anti-poaching UAV and thus make a historical contribution to a successful fight
against rhino poaching and finish as the winning team of the competition. 
Long
Live The Rhino!

</div></div>","We're excited to share our true story about a little known rainforest with you...

In 2009 we began crowdfunding the iGiveTrees campaign to give trees back to this endangered rainforest, while documenting the process to tell its story...








Learn why it is 93% deforested (look around your kitchen and dining room for clues), and meet the people who have been trying to restore it.




Thanks to people like you supporting a system that included a seed collecting family, a small nursery, a local NGO and many subsistence farm families, we've made some progress toward renewing this endangered rainforest. 





But due to he worst drought in the last century, our main tree supplier went out of business after losing thousands of baby trees in the nursery. 



Our project has been planting organically grown and maintained, native species trees. 


But some of our trees, already planted planted in the fields, are stressed. They need some extra care. What most people aren't aware of is how much manual labor is involved in keeping the trees happy after they've been planted.

We required that NO HERBICIDES be used. Local water supplies have already been contaminated by the chemicals applied to nearby Genetically Engineered Eucalyptus plantations. Many seedling trees planted through large reforestation projects don't even survive their first year. Since aggressive braquiária grass was planted to feed pasturing cattle, it must be cut or pulled from around each young tree several times a year. Trees can die due to lack of water, compacted soil and harsh weed control that usually includes herbicides.
During this campaign, anyone who makes a contribution of $60 or more toward TREE CARE will receive a 32 page, full color book, shipped to a US address, delivered in time for Christmas. After the campaign's closing date, books will be available through the iGive Trees website, but we can't offer pre-holiday delivery, and shipping charges will be an additional cost. 






For a $20 contribution you'll receive a download of a printable color poster of the Atlantic Forest in bloom – a sight rarely seen – as well as all of the offerings below.


  
For smaller contributions you'll receive gift cards you can print out, by Touch Drawing artist Deborah Koff-Chapin...



... a stellar music collection by these recording artists: Michael Bernhard Beckwith, Rickie Byars Beckwith, Ben Dowling, Marianne Lewis, Niki Harris, Katherine Woodward Thomas, Jami Lula, Ester Nicholson, Charles Holt, Gary Malkin, Hayley Sales and Faith Rivera...



...and even a gift certificate that you can print to put under your holiday tree! 







Will you please help our planet's children to have the gift of a diverse rainforest that they can give to their children?

in China.</p>
<p>China holds the largest number of
endangered Snow Leopards in the world (2000-2500 individuals, potentially 60%
of the global population). However the future of the elusive Snow Leopard
remains uncertain, threatened by an increase in human activity throughout their
range. </p>
<p>There is a need to support local
conservation initiatives throughout China in order to ensure the future
survival of the species. </p>
<p>We are running the Great Wall
Marathon to support and raise funds for such conservation projects. So far, we
have two athletes running a total of 63 kilometers (39 miles) dressed up (with
spotted face paint and tights) like Snow Leopards. We would love others to take
part in supporting this cause by either donating funds and/or joining us during
the Great Wall Marathon on May 17<sup>th</sup>, 2014 in Snow Leopard attire. (great-wall-marathon.com). 
</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise a total of
20,000 RMB, with $1,000 (~6,200 RMB) through this website. We have already
raised over 11,000 RMB in cash here in Beijing. </p>
<p>All proceeds will go directly to
conserving Snow Leopards on the ground in China. Money will support the
Wildlife Institute's work in conserving Snow Leopards in China's Gansu Province,
by allowing the conservation team to assess how many Snow Leopards are
currently living within QilianShan Nature Reserve. More specifically, the money
will contribute to monitoring Snow Leopards (using camera traps) and support
the local conservation team during the 2015 winter survey. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Vashon Nature Center is a nature education organization supporting a community of islanders and visitors who connect with island natural wonders and with each other through research, education, and citizen science. </p>
<p>OwlCam is a 24-hour livestream camera that we plan to install on an owl nest box this winter. Nesting season usually starts in February or March. This camera setup will allow us to share with everyone 24-hour footage of a barn owl family from egg to fledging. We will set up a livestream feed so that anyone may tune into it, any time!  Extra funds raised will support WildCam Vashon, an islandwide network of motion-sensing wildlife cameras including OwlCam.</p>
<p>We are excited about this for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the past few years, VNC staff and landowners where nest boxes have been placed, have learned a lot about the diets and habits of barn owls. And much of what they have observed has not yet been published in scientific literature. Having more community eyes on our owl nest boxes through this livestream feed has the potential for continued discovery and understanding about owl lives and behaviors.</li>
<li>We are all about creating community around nature! A community-sponsored owlcam, for the viewing enjoyment of all islanders, is an inclusive, shared natural history observation experience that has the potential to contribute to science. We are excited for our community to experience the thrill of following the daily lives of these amazing creatures.</li>
<li>This provides a tremendous educational opportunity for teachers and students (locally and around the world) to learn firsthand about the lives of owls. Our local elementary school second graders study owls every year-OwlCam would be a great addition to this unit!</li>
<li>OwlCam will be part of the Vashon Nature Center's larger wildlife camera network: WildCam Vashon. When owls are not nesting we will be able to use this livestream to share other amazing wildlife experiences with the local community. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to Heidi Grimsley at John L. Scott Realty we already have $500 designated for our livestream OwlCam! Axis Cameras and Camstreamer have also generously provided some camera equipment and software setup donations. Our goal is to raise the remaining $1500 for equipment and maintenance that will enable us to get the livestream camera off the ground. </p>
<p>The $1500 will be applied directly to the livestream Owlcam. If we receive more or less than $1500, the donations will be applied directly to WildCam Vashon. This includes administration and supplies for our existing motion- sensing camera network (35 remote sensing cameras) to cover: administration, storage space, batteries, memory cards, cable locks for wildlife cameras, replacing wildlife cameras that break etc. </p>
<p>We have offered the use of VNC wildlife cameras to many island residents who have noticed interesting wildlife on their properties and we will continue to do so. By teaming up with you, we have monitored deer kills and bear sign, salmon carcasses, and coyote movement patterns. We have checked for mountain beavers (but only turned up large rats so far), and confirmed beaver and cougar residents. Do you have an owl box? Do you have a nesting pair of owls? Contact us and perhaps we can livestream from your property one season!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>OwlCam is a part of WildCam Vashon, a citizen science program that actively engages our community in learning about our local wildlife. We build community as we share the common experience of observing and discovering nature together.</li>
<li>Wildlife cameras are very effective, non-invasive ways of learning more about animal habits and needs.</li>
<li>Together we can make discoveries about our local wildlife to help us better live alongside our wildlife populations. And possibly make new contributions to science!</li>
<li>Wildlife cameras provide early detection systems for new island species. For example, we relied on wildlife cameras to verify the presence of black bear, cougar, and beaver over the last two years on Vashon-Maury.</li>
<li>These cameras are also amazing educational tools that we can share with our local schools to supplement science curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Owls can change their nesting preferences, so there is a small chance that owls will not nest in an area where we can easily livestream this year. If this is the case, we will do our best to find another potentially useful location. If not, we will put the camera to use in another engaging location monitoring other island wildlife. We are not short on ideas!</p>
<p>We may experience difficulties setting up the livestream due to internet availability and the remote locations we may be working in. We have already asked for extra assistance from the vendors providing the cameras and software due to the nature-based locations we will be working in and received confirmation that they will assist us to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>Life in nature can be difficult: not all owl babies survive and sometimes entire nests are lost. If this happens we will grieve the passing of the owls and wait to see if the parents try for a second brood. If they don't we will have to wait until next year as moving the camera to another successful nest mid-season would be too disruptive for the animals. We may also choose to cut footage if circumstances become too hard to watch, or are not appropriate for children.</p>

<p>Our programs empower individuals with an engagement model to lead themselves, their families, communities and workplaces towards a sustainable world.</p>
<p>From the bottom UP, a grass roots approach, not from the TOP DOWN.</p>
<p>And who am I? I’m an artist, mother, three-time cancer survivor and entrepreneur.</p>
<p>And who are TerraBluTeams? We are educators, advocates, business and community leaders who believe sustainability is not just an option but an imperative. The health and well-being of each of us and the planet make a more sustainable world to live in.</p>
<p><strong>* I am campaigning as an individual as my non-profit is still awaiting 501 (c)(3) status certification, the IRS just informed us that when our status is activated, all contributions will be deductible retroactively to June, 2012.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Environmental and Economic Impact:</strong></p>
<p>There are many old and historic buildings in this country. Most of these older New England structures have inefficient or wasteful energy use. The Getting to Zero Project will model zero carbon living and working for other communities to emulate.</p>
<p>In the construction of the project we will be employing mostly local carpenters, electricians, engineers, architects, sustainability experts, students, interns, volunteers will help the local economy and revitalize the area.</p>
<p>There will be an airbnb unit for anyone to rent for a few days to see what zero carbon living is like and learn how it was achieved.</p>
<p>The building will be green; LEED and other organic and green certifications will be sought. It will have rainwater collection and grey water systems, solar design, super insulation, recycled materials, triple glazed windows, a heat-transfer ventilation system, and an air-to-water heat pump that will maintain a 63 degrees F temperature throughout the building year round.</p>
<p><strong>Social and Cultural Impact:</strong></p>
<p>We will be educating the youth, residents and other community members about zero carbon living. There will be classes with visiting sustainability specialists about how to live a sustainable lifestyle and sustainability for small business.</p>
<p>There will be space for theatrical and artistic performances, art galleries, and interactive exhibits on how the project was completed.</p>
<p>We will have paid residencies for local artisans and environmental artists.</p>
<p>The general public will have opportunities to use the Center for workshops and gatherings. Fun for all ages!</p>
<p>In partnership with Ipswich Community Access Media, we will continue executive producing sustainable education programs (done 6 already) about sustainable living and working. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>We have already hosted a small fundraiser, gotten the support of Ipswich residents, business and community leaders and members. We’re applying for grants and are awaiting our 501 (c)(3) status (IRS informs us they are still 6 months behind, when status is granted, all donations are deductible retroactively to 6/2012). We are doing all we can to fundraise but still need money from YOU!! Our budget is 1.2 Million, this campaign goal is $500K and every donation large or small gets us closer!</p>
<p><strong>So how did we get that number?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. These are the properties we have under consideration, an Old Town Hall (vacant) and an old auto repair place with a mixed use 2<sup>nd</sup> building (also vacant). About 40% of our budget is to secure a downtown structure (see below-both are in need of lots of work and love). </strong><strong> </strong></p>

The Getting to Zero Project is a model for sustainable living and social innovation. This campaign is more than just saving an historic or old commercial building in a sustainable way. This project will serve as an example of a non-profit driving sustainable value with inclusion and benefits for everyone. Community residents, students, interns, volunteers, political and business leaders will participate together for the health and well-being of themselves and the planet. 
My name is Vera Struck. I started Terrabluteams*, a Massachusetts non-profit corporation in Ipswich last January to fulfill a decade old dream. Terrabluteams is here to inspire, educate, motivate and facilitate positive change in human behavior towards a sustainable lifestyle and workplace; one person and one business at a time. 
Our programs empower individuals with an engagement model to lead themselves, their families, communities and workplaces towards a sustainable world.
From the bottom UP, a grass roots approach, not from the TOP DOWN.
And who am I? I’m an artist, mother, three-time cancer survivor and entrepreneur.
And who are TerraBluTeams? We are educators, advocates, business and community leaders who believe sustainability is not just an option but an imperative. The health and well-being of each of us and the planet make a more sustainable world to live in.
* I am campaigning as an individual as my non-profit is still awaiting 501 (c)(3) status certification, the IRS just informed us that when our status is activated, all contributions will be deductible retroactively to June, 2012.
 
The Impact:
Environmental and Economic Impact:
There are many old and historic buildings in this country. Most of these older New England structures have inefficient or wasteful energy use. The Getting to Zero Project will model zero carbon living and working for other communities to emulate.
In the construction of the project we will be employing mostly local carpenters, electricians, engineers, architects, sustainability experts, students, interns, volunteers will help the local economy and revitalize the area.
There will be an airbnb unit for anyone to rent for a few days to see what zero carbon living is like and learn how it was achieved.
The building will be green; LEED and other organic and green certifications will be sought. It will have rainwater collection and grey water systems, solar design, super insulation, recycled materials, triple glazed windows, a heat-transfer ventilation system, and an air-to-water heat pump that will maintain a 63 degrees F temperature throughout the building year round.
Social and Cultural Impact:
We will be educating the youth, residents and other community members about zero carbon living. There will be classes with visiting sustainability specialists about how to live a sustainable lifestyle and sustainability for small business.
There will be space for theatrical and artistic performances, art galleries, and interactive exhibits on how the project was completed.
We will have paid residencies for local artisans and environmental artists.
The general public will have opportunities to use the Center for workshops and gatherings. Fun for all ages!
In partnership with Ipswich Community Access Media, we will continue executive producing sustainable education programs (done 6 already) about sustainable living and working.  
What We Need:
We have already hosted a small fundraiser, gotten the support of Ipswich residents, business and community leaders and members.

<ul><li><p><b>The
	project explained in few lines</b><br/>This
	project focuses on the development of two environmental monitoring
	stations. One is fixed at the ground and another is a mobile unmanned
	vehicle. The stations will measure values such as radioactivity in
	the area, or atmospheric pollution. The mobile station will be effectively an autonomous drone (UAV). Once the project is completed, we
	will release via internet the schemes for the realization of this
	two stations. We will release all completely free of charge(open
	source), also if we can get a sufficient budget we will also open an
	e-commerce where you can buy both stations preassembled.</p></li></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/299315/files/20140109101540-3.jpg?1389291340"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Why
	Open Source?<br/></b>Open
	source because this type of technology should be free.<br/>Anyone
	should be able to benefit from the time and resources that we have
	used in this project.<br/>Universities, research laboratories,
	private companies and hobbyists will be able to access the schemes
	and code for replicating this project. They will be able to
	replicate the project, in order to build their own drone, by following the
	schemes and they will by able to do in a low cost way.<br/><br/>Our
	opinion is that in this era we need to share and collaborate. We
	need unity and mutual help. No secrets or closing. For this reason,
	this project is, and must remain, open source.<br/><br/>You do not
	know what is Open Source Hardware? You are not informed about the
	initiatives related to Open Source Hardware? Then watch this video!
	It is one of our sources of inspiration.<br/><a href=""http://youtu.be/jklVbLQjWXs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/jklVbLQjWXs</a>

	the final purpose of the project? <br/></b>This
	is a project that wants to help anyone who is interested in studying
	certain environments, and this applies also to the environment that
	surrounds him in person. Considering the fact that one of the key
	parts of this project is an UAV drone, it is possible to formulate a
	sentence like this: &lt;&lt; <i><b>The
	aim is to help the human being to study in safety the places
	considered ""at risk"" without having to expose themselves
	in first person. </b></i><i>The
	technology does not exists just to make our lives more comfortable,
	but exist also to help us to study the environment around us in
	complete safety, and also to help prevent damage to the human being
	itself. </i>&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>When
	the project is completed we will open a website that provides all the
	schemes necessary for the construction of both stations, the drone
	and the ground station. Will be provided both hardware schematics 
	and the code necessary software side.<br/>In addition, if we raise
	sufficient funds will open an online shop that will sell both
	stations preassembled and working. ( But we will continue to
	recommend DIY: build by yourself any of the two measuring stations,
	lead you to better understand of the same, and also during the
	construction process you will be able to apply any kind of
	customization and editing)

<p><b>How
	to help this project to become a reality?</b><span><span><br/>This project can become a reality only with the help of each of you. If
	what I wrote has touched you, if you think this project are worthy
	of note, if you want to help us, please make a donation.<br/><br/>We
	calculated that to complete this project properly, without
	shortcuts, we need 24000 euros. I and my team want to see this
	project finished and working. We want to see it fly, we want to see
	it helps people. We want to give our little contribution to what is
	humanity today. Although it is a very small contribution. We would
	love to see this drone fly and helping people to make all the
	measurements of the case in places "" dangerous."" So we
	decided that we will start working on the project even if we manage
	to collect a lot less money: we want to invest our time and our
	resources in this project. We decided that if we collect 6500 euros
	in any case we will start the work. For this we have set 6500 euros as a
	target of the campaign. <br/><br/>Any help, even a small help, is
	really important to us. And any help will be rewarded.<br/><br/>I want
	to repeat myself: we need you to make this project become a reality
	.</span>

<ul><li><p><b>Il

	la radioattività della zona, o l'inquinamento atmosferico. La
	stazione mobile sarà a tutti gli effetti un drone autonomo(UAV).
	Una volta completato il progetto verranno rilasciati pubblicamente
	in maniera completamente gratuita gli schemi per la realizzazione
	dello stesso(open source), inoltre se riusciremo ad ottenere un
	budget sufficiente verrà aperto anche un e-commerce dove sarà

<b>Come
	mai Open Source?<br/></b>Open
	source perché questo tipo di tecnologia deve essere
	libero.<br/>Chiunque deve poter beneficiare del tempo e delle risorse
	che abbiamo impiegato in questo progetto.<br/>Università, laboratori
	di ricerca, privati, aziende ed hobbisti avranno la possibilità di
	accedere agli schemi ed al codice per replicare questo progetto.
	Potranno replicare il loro progetto seguendo gli schemi e avendo dei
	costi bassi e contenuti.<br/><br/>Secondo noi in questo periodo
	storico abbiamo bisogno di condividere e di collaborare. Di unirci e
	di aiutarci. Non di segreti o chiusura. Per questo motivo questo
	progetto è, e deve restare, open source.<br/><br/>Non sai cosa è

	è lo scopo finale del progetto?</b><span><br/>Questo
	è un progetto che vuole aiutare chiunque sia interessato, a
	studiare determinati ambienti, e questo vale anche per l'ambiente
	che lo circonda in prima persona. Considerando il fatto che  una
	delle parti chiave di questo progetto è un drone UAV, è possibile
	formulare una sentenza di questo tipo: &lt;&lt;<i><b>Lo
	scopo è aiutare l'essere umano a studiare in sicurezza i luoghi
	considerati a “rischio” senza doversi esporre in prima linea.</b></i><i>La
	tecnologia non esiste solo per rendere più comode le nostre vite,
	ma anche per aiutarci a studiare l'ambiente che ci circonda in piena
	sicurezza, anche per aiutarci a prevenire danni all'essere umano
	stesso.</i>&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>Quando
	il progetto sarà completato verrà aperto un sito che fornirà
	tutti gli schemi necessari alla costruzione sia del drone di
	misurazione, sia della stazione fissa. Verranno forniti sia gli
	schemi hardware, sia il codice necessario lato software. <br/>Inoltre,
	se riusciremo a raccogliere sufficienti fondi verrà aperto uno shop
	online che vedrà entrambi le stazioni preassemblate e funzionanti
	(Ma continueremo a consigliare il D.I.Y: costruire la stazione di
	misurazione da se', che sia mobile o fissa, aiuta a comprenderne
	meglio il funzionamento, inoltre durante il processo di costruzione
	sarà possibile applicare ogni tipo di personalizzazione e
	modifica).</span></p></li></ul><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/299368/files/20140109102507-2.jpg?1389291907"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><ul><li><p><b>Come
	aiutare questo progetto a diventare realtà?</b><br/>Questo

	ciascuno di voi. Se quanto ho scritto vi ha toccato, se pensate che
	questo progetto sia degno di nota, se volete aiutarci, fate una
	donazione. <br/><br/>Abbiamo calcolato che per portare a

	necessari 24000 Euro. Io ed il mio team ci teniamo a questo
	progetto. Vogliamo vederlo volare, vogliamo vederlo aiutare delle
	persone, vogliamo dare anche noi il nostro piccolo contribuito a
	quella che è l'umanità quest'oggi. Anche se è un contributo molto
	piccolo. Ci piacerebbe vedere questo drone volare ed aiutare le
	persone a compiere tutte le misurazioni del caso in luoghi
	“pericolosi”.  Quindi abbiamo deciso che inizieremo a lavorare
	al progetto anche nel caso in cui riuscissimo a raccogliere molti
	meno fondi: vogliamo investire il nostro tempo e le nostre risorse
	in questo progetto. Abbiamo deciso che se riusciremo a raccogliere
	6500 euro inizieremo in ogni caso i lavori. Per questo abbiamo
	impostato 6500 euro come obbiettivo della campagna.<br/><br/>Ogni

EMS00X – Environmental Measuring Station
The
	project explained in few linesThis
	project focuses on the development of two environmental monitoring
	stations. One is fixed at the ground and another is a mobile unmanned
	vehicle. The stations will measure values such as radioactivity in
	the area, or atmospheric pollution. The mobile station will be effectively an autonomous drone (UAV). Once the project is completed, we
	will release via internet the schemes for the realization of this
	two stations. We will release all completely free of charge(open
	source), also if we can get a sufficient budget we will also open an
	e-commerce where you can buy both stations preassembled.
Why
	Open Source?Open
	source because this type of technology should be free.Anyone
	should be able to benefit from the time and resources that we have
	used in this project.Universities, research laboratories,
	private companies and hobbyists will be able to access the schemes
	and code for replicating this project. They will be able to
	replicate the project, in order to build their own drone, by following the
	schemes and they will by able to do in a low cost way.Our
	opinion is that in this era we need to share and collaborate. We
	need unity and mutual help. No secrets or closing. For this reason,
	this project is, and must remain, open source.You do not
	know what is Open Source Hardware? You are not informed about the
	initiatives related to Open Source Hardware? Then watch this video!
	It is one of our sources of inspiration.http://youtu.be/jklVbLQjWXs
	(Marcin Jakubowski: open source projects for machinery)
	What
	the final purpose of the project? This
	is a project that wants to help anyone who is interested in studying
	certain environments, and this applies also to the environment that
	surrounds him in person. Considering the fact that one of the key
	parts of this project is an UAV drone, it is possible to formulate a
	sentence like this: << The
	aim is to help the human being to study in safety the places
	considered ""at risk"" without having to expose themselves
	in first person. The
	technology does not exists just to make our lives more comfortable,
	but exist also to help us to study the environment around us in
	complete safety, and also to help prevent damage to the human being
	itself. >>When
	the project is completed we will open a website that provides all the
	schemes necessary for the construction of both stations, the drone
	and the ground station. Will be provided both hardware schematics 
	and the code necessary software side.In addition, if we raise
	sufficient funds will open an online shop that will sell both
	stations preassembled and working. ( But we will continue to
	recommend DIY: build by yourself any of the two measuring stations,
	lead you to better understand of the same, and also during the
	construction process you will be able to apply any kind of
	customization and editing)
	
How
	to help this project to become a reality?This project can become a reality only with the help of each of you. If
	what I wrote has touched you, if you think this project are worthy
	of note, if you want to help us, please make a donation.We
	calculated that to complete this project properly, without
	shortcuts, we need 24000 euros. I and my team want to see this
	project finished and working. We want to see it fly, we want to see
	it helps people. We want to give our little contribution to what is
	humanity today. Although it is a very small contribution. We would
	love to see this drone fly and helping people to make all the
	measurements of the case in places "" dangerous."" So we
	decided that we will start working on the project even if we manage
	to collect a lot less money: we want to invest our time and our
	resources in this project. We decided that if we collect 6500 euros
	in any case we will start the work. For this we have set 6500 euros as a
	target of the campaign. Any help, even a small help, is
	really important to us. And any help will be rewarded.I want
	to repeat myself: we need you to make this project become a reality
	.

Project EMS00X – Environmental Measuring Station
Il
	progetto spiegato in poche righeQuesto
	progetto è incentrato sullo sviluppo di una stazione di misurazione
	ambientale fissa ed una mobile. Le stazioni misureranno valori come
	la radioattività della zona, o l'inquinamento atmosferico. La
	stazione mobile sarà a tutti gli effetti un drone autonomo(UAV).
	Una volta completato il progetto verranno rilasciati pubblicamente
	in maniera completamente gratuita gli schemi per la realizzazione
	dello stesso(open source), inoltre se riusciremo ad ottenere un
	budget sufficiente verrà aperto anche un e-commerce dove sarà
	possibile acquistare entrambe le stazioni di misurazione ambientale.

Come
	mai Open Source?Open
	source perché questo tipo di tecnologia deve essere
	libero.Chiunque deve poter beneficiare del tempo e delle risorse
	che abbiamo impiegato in questo progetto.Università, laboratori
	di ricerca, privati, aziende ed hobbisti avranno la possibilità di
	accedere agli schemi ed al codice per replicare questo progetto.
	Potranno replicare il loro progetto seguendo gli schemi e avendo dei
	costi bassi e contenuti.Secondo noi in questo periodo
	storico abbiamo bisogno di condividere e di collaborare. Di unirci e
	di aiutarci. Non di segreti o chiusura. Per questo motivo questo
	progetto è, e deve restare, open source.Non sai cosa è
	l'Hardware Open Source? Non sei informato sulle iniziative legate al
	Hardware Open Source? Allora guarda questo video! Si tratta di una
	delle nostre fonti di ispirazione.http://youtu.be/jklVbLQjWXs
	( Marcin Jakubowski: Progetti per macchinari open source )
	Quale
	è lo scopo finale del progetto?Questo
	è un progetto che vuole aiutare chiunque sia interessato, a
	studiare determinati ambienti, e questo vale anche per l'ambiente
	che lo circonda in prima persona. Considerando il fatto che  una
	delle parti chiave di questo progetto è un drone UAV, è possibile
	formulare una sentenza di questo tipo: <<Lo
	scopo è aiutare l'essere umano a studiare in sicurezza i luoghi
	considerati a “rischio” senza doversi esporre in prima linea.La
	tecnologia non esiste solo per rendere più comode le nostre vite,
	ma anche per aiutarci a studiare l'ambiente che ci circonda in piena
	sicurezza, anche per aiutarci a prevenire danni all'essere umano
	stesso.>>Quando
	il progetto sarà completato verrà aperto un sito che fornirà
	tutti gli schemi necessari alla costruzione sia del drone di
	misurazione, sia della stazione fissa. Verranno forniti sia gli
	schemi hardware, sia il codice necessario lato software. Inoltre,
	se riusciremo a raccogliere sufficienti fondi verrà aperto uno shop
	online che vedrà entrambi le stazioni preassemblate e funzionanti
	(Ma continueremo a consigliare il D.I.Y: costruire la stazione di
	misurazione da se', che sia mobile o fissa, aiuta a comprenderne
	meglio il funzionamento, inoltre durante il processo di costruzione
	sarà possibile applicare ogni tipo di personalizzazione e
	modifica).Come
	aiutare questo progetto a diventare realtà?Questo
	progetto può diventare una realtà di fatto solo con l'aiuto di
	ciascuno di voi. Se quanto ho scritto vi ha toccato, se pensate che
	questo progetto sia degno di nota, se volete aiutarci, fate una
	donazione. Abbiamo calcolato che per portare a
	termine correttamente questo progetto, senza scorciatoie, sono
	necessari 24000 Euro. Io ed il mio team ci teniamo a questo
	progetto. Vogliamo vederlo volare, vogliamo vederlo aiutare delle
	persone, vogliamo dare anche noi il nostro piccolo contribuito a
	quella che è l'umanità quest'oggi. Anche se è un contributo molto
	piccolo. Ci piacerebbe vedere questo drone volare ed aiutare le
	persone a compiere tutte le misurazioni del caso in luoghi
	“pericolosi”.  Quindi abbiamo deciso che inizieremo a lavorare
	al progetto anche nel caso in cui riuscissimo a raccogliere molti
	meno fondi: vogliamo investire il nostro tempo e le nostre risorse
	in questo progetto. Abbiamo deciso che se riusciremo a raccogliere
	6500 euro inizieremo in ogni caso i lavori. Per questo abbiamo
	impostato 6500 euro come obbiettivo della campagna.Ogni
	aiuto, anche piccolo, è davvero importante. E ogni aiuto verrà
	riconosciuto. Voglio ripetermi: c'è bisogno di voi per far
	diventare realtà questo progetto.

プロジェクトには、数行で説明このプロジェクトは、固定環境モニタリングステーションの開発と一つの移動に焦点を当てています。局は、このような領域における放射能、または大気汚染などの値を測定する。移動局は、事実上自律無人機（UAV）となります。一度完成したプロジェクトは、公的に我々は十分な予算を得ることができるかどうかもまた、周囲を測定する両方のステーションを購入することができ、電子商取引を開き、同じ（オープンソース）を実現するための充電方式の自由を完全に解放されます。

なぜオープンソース？オープンソース技術のこのタイプは自由でなければならないので、。我々の誰もが、このプロジェクトで使用されてきた時間と資源の恩恵を受けることができるはずです。
大学、研究機関、民間企業や愛好家は、このプロジェクトをコピーするために図やコードにアクセスできるようになります。彼らは、ダイアグラム以下と低コストと内容の彼らのプロジェクトを複製することができます。この時代は、我々は知識や技術を共有し、共同作業をする必要があります。団結して私たち自身を助けるために。すべてを共有する。このため、本プロジェクトは、オープンソースでなければなりません。あなたは、オープンソースハードウェアが何であるかわからない？あなたは、ソースハードウェアをオープンに関連する取り組みについて知らされていない？そして、このビデオを見て！それは、インスピレーションのわれわれの情報源の一つです。http://youtu.be/jklVbLQjWXs

<span class=""notranlsate""><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The dramatic decline in fish stocks over the past decade has caused increasing pressure on both fishermen and marine mammals. Both have the same problem in finding fish and this causes an increase in conflict between small-scale fishermen and marine mammals such as the bottlenose dolphin (<i>Tursiops truncatus</i>), the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal (<i>Monachus monachus</i>) and loggerhead turtles (<i>Caretta caretta</i>).</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a result these rare marine animals increasingly take food directly from the nets of small-scale fishermen. Not only does this cause costly damage to the fishermen’s nets, but their catches are also being “stolen” and thus their earnings are reduced. Furthermore, on rare occasions, dolphins and monk seals sometimes can become entangled in the nets and die. This can be detrimental to populations, especially for the already critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As a short-term solution to reduce the conflict between fishermen and marine mammals, Archipelagos’ scientists are seeking funds that will allow them to replace the fishermen's small-mesh nets with nets composed of a larger mesh. Marine mammals tend to cause less damage to these, while this type of net is also more selective (i.e. has bigger holes and catches larger fish) and hence contributes to a more sustainable fishery.

Save the
dolphins and seals and help the fishing community on the small island of Lipsi in the
Aegean Sea


According to legend, many years ago the
island of Lipsi was where Ulysses met Kalypso to spend a long and infinite
life. From this story the name Lipsi derives from Kalypso.Lipsi is found in the eastern Aegean Sea in Greece and is home to a wonderful marine biodiversity, which includes many endangered marine mammals. The island has a small population, comprising only 790 inhabitants. Small scale fisheries have long been the basis of this community, providing food and jobs. Many of the islanders are small scale fishermen and with their small boats spend all night, every night working hard at sea.

Both have the same problem in finding fish and this causes an increase in conflict between small-scale fishermen and marine mammals such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta).

As a result these rare marine animals increasingly take food directly from the nets of small-scale fishermen. Not only does this cause costly damage to the fishermen’s nets, but their catches are also being “stolen” and thus their earnings are reduced. Furthermore, on rare occasions, dolphins and monk seals sometimes can become entangled in the nets and die. This can be detrimental to populations, especially for the already critically endangered Mediterranean monk seal.

> WHAT DOES ARCHIPELAGOS DO?
Archipelagos
Institute of Marine Conservation (www.archipelago.gr)
is working to create a co-managed fisheries protected area around the island by working closely with the local community to give them active
role in the protection of their fish stocks.

For this
reason an international team of volunteer scientists and students from Archipelagos have been based on the
island of Lipsi for the past 5 months and continue to work there in order to collect the necessary data
for the creation of this fisheries protected area. 
As a short-term solution to reduce the conflict between fishermen and marine mammals, Archipelagos’ scientists are seeking funds that will allow them to replace the fishermen's small-mesh nets with nets composed of a larger mesh. Marine mammals tend to cause less damage to these, while this type of net is also more selective (i.e. has bigger holes and catches larger fish) and hence contributes to a more sustainable fishery. This helps to reduce conflict between the two groups.

> WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN FOR?
Archipelagos
would like to help in reducing the conflict between the small scale fishermen and marine mammals by purchasing and providing the local
fishermen with nets of larger mesh. These have two benefits:


First
of all, they are less damaged by marine mammals
Secondly,
because the larger holes in the nets are more selective, the fishing practice is
more sustainable because smaller fish can escape and repopulate the area


> Help us protect marine mammals
> Help us reduce the conflict between artisanal fishermen and marine mammals, and actively involve fishermen in their conservation.

> Help us ensure sustainable practices of fishing, with minimum damage to the
environment.



> Help us protect and increase fish stocks
> Help us collaborate with more fishermen across more Aegean Islands.


IN ORDER TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE SMALL SCALE FISHERMEN OF THE LIPSI COMMUNITY WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE €5400.

<h2 style=""color: rgb(112, 154, 1);""> <strong>Are  GMOs Safe?</strong>
</h2>
<p> It  doesn’t matter, you won’t be suing their creators thanks to the  passing of the “Monsanto Act” which frees biotech companies from  their liability to the people and from judicial accountability. </p>
<p> Many believe  there’s something that seems sneaky about people manufacturing,  engineering and processing food and then when it’s done…they  don’t want to tell anyone what’s actually in it. Why? What are  they hiding? What don’t they want us to know?</p>
<p> Look  at clothing, manufacturers are required to list the contents of what  we wear. It’s important for us to know what we are wearing, but not  what we are eating? </p>

<li>
<p> GMOs are  	now present in 75 to 80% of conventional processed food in the U.S.  	(according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association.)</p>

<p>Because vertical growing can take place  in “closed system” greenhouse facilities, we can maintain a  sterile growing and handling environment.  Unlike with organically  grown crops in outdoor environments, we can eliminate plant  contamination from animal feces and urine, transfer of potential  feces from human picking and handling, airborne pathogens and  downwind spay of toxic chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides.  This  makes Living Produce a safe alternative to produce grown in  uncontrolled environments.<br/>

you deserve to have an informed choice of what you feed your family?
In the
USA, GMOs are not labeled…think it’s not an issue for you?  Think
again…


GMOs
	are BANNED or significantly restricted in over 40 countries around
	the world including China, Russia and all of the European Union


GMOs
	are now present in nearly 80% of conventional processed food in the
	US (according
	to the Grocery Manufacturers Association)


There
	are over 75 genetically engineered foods in the pipeline that
	companies are trying to get approved including an apple that NEVER
	turns brown!


Average
	meal contains ingredients from 5 countries

An
	apple takes on average 14 months from harvesting to the time it
	reaches your table


Refer Your Friends and Get Rewards!



 
Did you Know?


Average meal contains ingredients  	from 5 countries with less than 10% of that food inspected


Average apple takes 14 months from  	time of harvest to reach your table – stored in a warehouse for up  	to 1 year


Over 1/3 of produce in America is  	imported





Our Solution: 



Nutrient Dense, Fresh Organic,  	Non-GMO Produce. 


Harvested and shipped with the  		roots on within 24-hours of harvesting*!
      (*to most West Coast  states)
  





Affordable Prices. 


Up to 50% less than many organic produce in store prices!



Preserve Water 
    
Our method uses 98% less water  		than typical farming
      
    




Maximize our land. 
    
Living Produce uses 88% less land  		mass than typical farming
    




Preserve the roots of the produce  	AND the community of like-minded people joining forces. 
    
40 acres can feed over 200,000  		people 
        
Generating over 120 million  		pounds of nutrient dense produce 
      





Preserve Land.
  Preserve Water.  
With Living Produce, we  use 88% less land mass for production and less than 95% of the  water. 
 
Why We Need Living Produce
 
 
 Are  GMOs Safe?

 It  doesn’t matter, you won’t be suing their creators thanks to the  passing of the “Monsanto Act” which frees biotech companies from  their liability to the people and from judicial accountability. 
 Many believe  there’s something that seems sneaky about people manufacturing,  engineering and processing food and then when it’s done…they  don’t want to tell anyone what’s actually in it. Why? What are  they hiding? What don’t they want us to know?
 Look  at clothing, manufacturers are required to list the contents of what  we wear. It’s important for us to know what we are wearing, but not  what we are eating? 


 GMOs are  	now present in 75 to 80% of conventional processed food in the U.S.  	(according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association.)


 In the U.S  	90% of all soybeans are genetically engineered


 

Because vertical growing can take place  in “closed system” greenhouse facilities, we can maintain a  sterile growing and handling environment.  Unlike with organically  grown crops in outdoor environments, we can eliminate plant  contamination from animal feces and urine, transfer of potential  feces from human picking and handling, airborne pathogens and  downwind spay of toxic chemicals, fertilizers and pesticides.  This  makes Living Produce a safe alternative to produce grown in  uncontrolled environments.


 
How Fresh Is Your Produce?
 
 
Avoid Contamination & Enhanced Food Safety
 


Virtually Eliminate Waste
 




33% of all food produced each year  	is wasted


Over $15 billion/year is lost by  	super markets in unsold produce


$250 billion is lost due to waste  	throughout the entire food chain


Nearly $3,000 per year is wasted  	on over 240 pounds of food that is thrown out by the average family


We are delivered  fresh to your door within 24-hours of harvesting.  It’s almost like  having produce “On Demand!”  Our goal is to significantly reduce  the food wasted in our supply chain while feeding more people.  


Distribution - We can deliver to  many west coast states within 24-hours of harvesting!  That’s what  we call Fresh to Your Door, On the Dot!  It doesn’t get much easier  than opening your door to pick up fresh produce.
Year-Round Production – Since  Living Produce is grown in “closed” indoor, climate-controlled  growing centers, this enables year-round production of favorite  varieties and rare plant varietals that are often difficult to get. 
Superior Plant Nutrients – The patent-pending growing technology delivers the  full spectrum of nutrients required for healthy, sustainable plant  growth. 
 
 
Sample Photos of patent Pending Technology




When
With your help…once  we reach our goal we can be in production within 90-days!  You can be  one of the first on the list to receive notification and the first  shipment of Living Produce!



Why Now
If  not now, when? We have to take charge and start making a difference  by preserving our land, preserving our water and restoring the roots  of what make us great as a society!  With your help, we know we are  the community that is going to lead the way for how produce is grown  in the future.  We have the opportunity now to feed hundreds of  millions, not with chemical laden food, rather with nutrient dense  AFFORDABLE produce!  But we can’t do it alone, we need your help.
 
Where
Our land is just  outside Salt Lake City, UT.  We have purchased 40-acres which allows  us to be able to deliver to most of the western states within  24-hours of harvesting produce. 


 What - Living Produce
  literally alive when it arrives at your door!
Living Produce is  literally alive when delivered to your door, the next day after being  harvested.  Then, your produce can remain alive for 7 to 10 days  before it loses peak phytonutrient value.

 
Progress
We  have already purchased the land, have the architectural drawings and  commitments for the majority of the funding.  So why are we asking  for your help? 
We want a community  behind our build.  We want to know that we have people that support  our efforts from the roots up and are dedicated to this type of  lifestyle and creating a new eco-system in our agricultural  community. 


 

Use of Funds
We will use 100% of the funds we raise from this campaign to  actually build the first growhouse!  You will be part of making this  happen and to reward you, you will be one of the first we notify when  we are ready to ship our first orders of Living Produce!

The Terra Viva Grants Directory
develops and manages free information about grants for agriculture, energy,
environment, and natural resources in the world's developing countries.  The
Directory includes free postings from over 500 grant makers, with regional
coverage for the developing world. Application
deadlines are listed by months, subject areas, and forms of grant support.  The service also provides a strategic inclusion of information
resources for grant seekers.
Project Background
To-date, TVGD has included a wealth of
information on hundreds of sources of grants that we make available on a free
website. Through a feed service, the
Directory keeps free subscribers informed about new and recurring grants. However, a much needed improvement to the service would be an upgrade of its searchable
database to expand and facilitate the use of the website. Since our service is
free, TVGD has no revenue source to fund this valuable enhancement to the
Directory. 
Aim of the Project
The TVGD database development project aims to expand
and improve its free services on the website by enhancing the existing searchable database of
grant makers.
Your contributions will help pay for the technical
programming and data management required to expand the database on the
TVGD website. Once the database is upgraded, we expect a substantial
increase in users of the Directory as they will be able to more easily and more
efficiently sort the free information that they need to find grants for their
developing world projects.

TVGD
is a non-profit 501c3 institution which provides a free grant
searching service for organizations that need funding support.
What We Need & What You GetThe additional programming of the searchable
database will require
approximately 10 working days by a technical and programming consultant. This
individual will also run beta testing of the new database, as well as
completing the final installation and initialization of the database.The estimated total cost of the project is US$5,000. The ImpactCurrently, TVGD reaches 20 thousand organizations
and individuals per month, 80% of whom are located in the developing
countries.  The expansion of our searchable
database will increase the number of users who are successful in finding the
support that they need to make their projects successful in some
of the poorest regions of the world.  Your contribution to the
upgrade of our services will allow TVGD to remain a free portal of
information for groups who are least likely to afford payment for this type of
service.Why TVGD?
 The TVGD
Directory is one of the few if not the only free on-line sources of grants that
focus on developing world initiatives in the areas of environment, energy,
agriculture and natural resources. Your donations to this effort will:
Allow TVGD resources to remain free for the many
small and medium sized efforts that cannot afford to pay high application and
proposal fees when searching for funding.
Although it is a free service, maintain leading
technologies and high quality service while expanding access for the users of
our site.
Improve access for under-served developing world populations.

Bien sûr, ne vous en faites pas, nous allons tout faire pour rendre ce projet le plus compréhensible possible auprès de tous ! Ce projet est tout ce qu’il y a de plus sérieux et s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une compétition étudiante

<div align=""center"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cette compétition, comme son nom l’indique est une <b>compétition de biologie de synthèse</b> (on reviendra sur ce principe plus tard) organisée par le prestigieux <b>MIT</b> (Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Boston) qui rassemble cette année plusieurs centaines d’équipes à travers le monde. <br/></p>

les outils de la biologie de synthèse pour imaginer et créer de nouveaux
systèmes biologiques avec des propriétés étonnantes. La biologie de synthèse,
c’est un des domaines qui connait le plus de croissance dans le secteur de la
biologie et des biotechnologies. Cette discipline regroupe l’ensemble des
techniques utilisées par les généticiens, les biologistes moléculaires et
autres scientifiques qui permettent de <b>concevoir des organismes vivants avec

Ce projet c’est
avant tout une <b>expérience qui se vit en groupe</b>. L’équipe IGEM Bordeaux 2014
c’est Diane, Claudia, Gilles, Edouard, Jean-Rémy, Mounir, Justine,
Xavier, Julien, Zohra, Caroline, Floriane, Cassandra, Alexandre,
Geoffrey, Hiba, Lauriane et Ismaël, tous étudiants en école d’ingénieur (ENSTBB) ou à
l’Université de Bordeaux et encadrés par Denis Dupuy, Marie Beurton-Aimar et
Elisabeth Garanger, chercheurs rattachés à l’INSERM ou au CNRS. Mais l’équipe
IGEM Bordeaux 2014 c’est aussi toutes les personnes qui nous entourent au
quotidien et qui nous aident à avancer dans ce projet ambitieux. Et puis, cette
équipe c’est aussi un peu <b>vous</b>, passionnés de sciences ou simples curieux, qui comprenez l’intérêt de notre projet et
l’intérêt de la biologie dans notre société actuelle. <b>Au nom de toute l’équipe
je vous adresse d’ores et déjà nos sincères remerciements pour les quelques
minutes passées à découvrir notre projet.</b><br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div align=""center"">
<h3><i><b>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</b></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Vous vous en doutez, la recherche de
financements est une étape cruciale dans la réussite de notre projet. Nous
sommes déjà soutenus par notre université et par quelques entreprises telles que Teknimed (spécialisée dans les biomatériaux), l'Ambassade de France aux Etats-Unis, la Région Aquitaine, Genscript, l'INSERM et le CNRS, mais nous
avions envie, pour compléter notre budget, d’un financement collaboratif. Avec
le ""crowdfunding"", nous souhaitons <b>faire découvrir notre projet à un
maximum de personnes</b>. Cette plateforme nous permet, en plus de récolter des
fonds, d’interagir directement avec vous, d’échanger nos idées et de vous faire
part de nos avancées. Vous vous impliquez dans notre projet et on s’engage à
une totale transparence, c’est là le principe séduisant du financement participatif. </p>

L’argent que nous arriverons à récolter servira en premier
à financer l’achat de matériel pour le laboratoire. </p>

Malheureusement non, entre les
molécules chimiques qui rentrent dans la composition des milieux de culture ou
les consommables utilisés pour les manipulations, les frais de laboratoire
peuvent vite devenir importants. Mais nous avons déjà réussi à produire un peu de nos fameuses protéines ! Ensuite, une autre partie du financement
servira à couvrir les frais d’inscription de l’équipe (2 600 €) et des
participants (550 € par membre de l’équipe). C’est ce que représentent donc
les 15 000 € dont nous avons besoin. Enfin, si vous vous montrez très
généreux, l’argent restant sera utilisé pour envoyer un maximum de personnes de
l’équipe présenter le projet. Et oui, souvenez-vous, la compétition est
organisée par le MIT, et je vous laisse deviner où est localisé ce prestigieux
institut ? </p>

Cette compétition, comme son nom l’indique est une compétition de biologie de synthèse (on reviendra sur ce principe plus tard) organisée par le prestigieux MIT (Massachussetts Institute of Technology, Boston) qui rassemble cette année plusieurs centaines d’équipes à travers le monde. 
Comme chaque équipe participante, nous allons utiliser
les outils de la biologie de synthèse pour imaginer et créer de nouveaux
systèmes biologiques avec des propriétés étonnantes. La biologie de synthèse,
c’est un des domaines qui connait le plus de croissance dans le secteur de la
biologie et des biotechnologies. Cette discipline regroupe l’ensemble des
techniques utilisées par les généticiens, les biologistes moléculaires et
autres scientifiques qui permettent de concevoir des organismes vivants avec
des caractéristiques inédites. 
Oui bon euh ... ça serait drôle en effet, mais ce n'est
rien de tout ça. Ce que nous allons utiliser pour créer notre système
biologique est un être vivant bien plus petit , même invisible à l’œil nu et
pourtant présent dans chacun de nous. 
C’est
Escherichia coli, une bactérie bien connue des scientifiques. 
Bien évidemment ! Vous ne le savez surement pas mais
les bactéries sont utiles pour plein de choses. Ce sont même elles aujourd’hui
qui produisent une partie des biocarburants ou certains de nos médicaments.
Ce que nous allons leur faire fabriquer, ce sont des matériaux avec des propriétés
plastiques, élastiques et entièrement biodégradables. 



 Oui en quelque sorte, mais avec des applications plus
ciblées vers la santé et la médecine. Plus concrètement, nous allons faire produire
à nos bactéries, un ensemble de protéines 
comme celles que l’on retrouve dans les toiles d’araignées ou celles
responsables de l’élasticité de notre peau qui vont ensuite s’assembler et
former ce qu’on appelle des polymères. 

C’est tout à
fait ça, après quelques étapes d’électrospining ou autres procédés aux noms
barbares on devrait obtenir des fils avec une élasticité et une résistance
incroyable. Ces fils pourraient par exemple, dans le futur, être utilisés par
les chirurgiens pour remplacer des tendons endommagés !



L'équipe iGEM Bordeaux 

Ce projet c’est
avant tout une expérience qui se vit en groupe. L’équipe IGEM Bordeaux 2014
c’est Diane, Claudia, Gilles, Edouard, Jean-Rémy, Mounir, Justine,
Xavier, Julien, Zohra, Caroline, Floriane, Cassandra, Alexandre,
Geoffrey, Hiba, Lauriane et Ismaël, tous étudiants en école d’ingénieur (ENSTBB) ou à
l’Université de Bordeaux et encadrés par Denis Dupuy, Marie Beurton-Aimar et
Elisabeth Garanger, chercheurs rattachés à l’INSERM ou au CNRS. Mais l’équipe
IGEM Bordeaux 2014 c’est aussi toutes les personnes qui nous entourent au
quotidien et qui nous aident à avancer dans ce projet ambitieux. Et puis, cette
équipe c’est aussi un peu vous, passionnés de sciences ou simples curieux, qui comprenez l’intérêt de notre projet et
l’intérêt de la biologie dans notre société actuelle. Au nom de toute l’équipe
je vous adresse d’ores et déjà nos sincères remerciements pour les quelques
minutes passées à découvrir notre projet.


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez

Vous vous en doutez, la recherche de
financements est une étape cruciale dans la réussite de notre projet. Nous
sommes déjà soutenus par notre université et par quelques entreprises telles que Teknimed (spécialisée dans les biomatériaux), l'Ambassade de France aux Etats-Unis, la Région Aquitaine, Genscript, l'INSERM et le CNRS, mais nous
avions envie, pour compléter notre budget, d’un financement collaboratif. Avec
le ""crowdfunding"", nous souhaitons faire découvrir notre projet à un
maximum de personnes. Cette plateforme nous permet, en plus de récolter des
fonds, d’interagir directement avec vous, d’échanger nos idées et de vous faire
part de nos avancées. Vous vous impliquez dans notre projet et on s’engage à
une totale transparence, c’est là le principe séduisant du financement participatif. 

L’argent que nous arriverons à récolter servira en premier
à financer l’achat de matériel pour le laboratoire. 

Malheureusement non, entre les
molécules chimiques qui rentrent dans la composition des milieux de culture ou
les consommables utilisés pour les manipulations, les frais de laboratoire
peuvent vite devenir importants. Mais nous avons déjà réussi à produire un peu de nos fameuses protéines ! Ensuite, une autre partie du financement
servira à couvrir les frais d’inscription de l’équipe (2 600 €) et des
participants (550 € par membre de l’équipe). C’est ce que représentent donc
les 15 000 € dont nous avons besoin. Enfin, si vous vous montrez très
généreux, l’argent restant sera utilisé pour envoyer un maximum de personnes de
l’équipe présenter le projet. Et oui, souvenez-vous, la compétition est
organisée par le MIT, et je vous laisse deviner où est localisé ce prestigieux
institut ? 


On est d’accord. C’est là-bas que toutes les équipes
du monde participant au concours se retrouveront en octobre 2014 et qu’un jury
spécialisé décernera les récompenses. Pour en savoir plus
sur la compétition et sur cette année particulière qui marque le 10ème
anniversaire de l’IGEM je vous invite à consulter le site internet
officiel : http://2014.igem.org/Main_Page

En plus de nos sincères
remerciements et de la satisfaction d’avoir accompli un acte généreux,
l’équipe IGEM Bordeaux 2014 à envisagé différentes contreparties pour vous
faire plaisir. Ainsi, vous vous verrez offrir, entre autres, des stickers, des
cartes postales de Boston avec un mot de l’équipe, des t-shirts de l’équipe, des mugs ou encore des casquettes à nos couleurs, mais aussi des contreparties bien plus originales comme notre jeu de société IGAME inventé et développé par l’équipe qui vous assurera des moments sympas entre amis ou en famille tout en découvrant la biologie et la compétition iGEM.
Pour les plus généreux d’entre vous, vous recevrez une photo unique de l’équipe
portant une banderole à votre nom devant les monuments les plus prestigieux de
Boston. Vous aurez également la chance de voir votre nom ou votre logo sur nos
T-shirts que l’on portera lors de la présentation. Enfin, il se peut même que
certains d’entre vous viennent avec nous à Boston pour partager cette
expérience unique, et que le nom officiel de l'équipe soit tout simplement ... le votre ! 



Pour aller plus loin

Ce paragraphe s'adresse à ceux qui s’intéressent à la partie scientifique du projet.

Concrètement nous avons étudié les séquences génétiques des protéines naturelles élastiques et nous nous en sommes inspirés pour réaliser des gènes synthétiques. Ainsi la bactérie produira des protéines élastiques. Grâce à la construction génique utilisée (Biobrick assembly) et optimisée, cela permet de systématiser les constructions géniques et de fusionner les gènes, on peut donc ainsi créer de nouvelles protéines élastiques. 
Dans le détail, une fois l'ADN intégré dans les bactéries on lance la production de protéines en mettant en culture les bactéries dans un milieu de culture en Erlenmeyer de 2 L.

Ensuite les bactéries sont incubées à 37°C pendant 21h.Puis on va tuer les bactéries et récupérer les protéines par centrifugation. 
Au final on récupère des fractions pures de protéines et ainsi on peut tester les caractéristiques physiques et structurales.



Résultats


La fraction pure de protéine nous a permis d'identifier une première caractéristique intéressante, visible dans la vidéo ci-dessous.



De plus avec les protéines solubles nous avons fabriqué des fils élastiques par wet spinning (précipitation dans de l'eau salée) : voir photo et vidéo ci-dessous 

 



L'impact

Si vous
voulez en savoir plus sur notre équipe et sur la manière dont nous pouvons
modifier des bactéries pour leur faire produire des matériaux intéressants, je
vous invite chaleureusement à nous écrire un mail à igembordeaux@gmail.com. Au-delà d’une simple participation financière à un événement
scientifique, votre contribution va permettre à de jeunes étudiants, futur
chercheurs ou ingénieurs, de réaliser leur premier projet scientifique et de se
confronter à la réalité du monde de la recherche. En marquant ainsi votre
intérêt pour la biologie et en nous faisant confiance, votre engagement devient
synonyme d’encouragements et de motivation. 
L'iGEM est une compétition reconnue dans le monde entier. La presse et les sites internet spécialisés relatent évidemment cet évènement et parlent de nous :

L’équipe de
Bordeaux a déjà participé à deux reprises au concours iGEM et a remporté une
médaille de bronze lors de l’édition 2012. Pour cette troisième participation,
l’équipe de Bordeaux se présente avec un projet original et une équipe plus que
motivée rendant ainsi nos chances de médailles bien réelles. Mais vous l’avez
compris, cette aventure ne peut se concrétiser qu’avec votre aide. 

D'autres façons d'aider

Si vous êtes
vous-même étudiant ou que vous n’avez pas les moyens de contribuer
financièrement à notre projet il vous reste encore plein d’autres solutions
pour nous montrer votre soutien. Un simple message d’encouragement à igembordeaux@gmail.com saura redonner de l’énergie à toute l’équipe pendant les longues soirées
passées au laboratoire. Vous pouvez aussi tout simplement en parler autour de
vous, faire découvrir le projet à vos amis et à vos proches ou nous suivre sur
les réseaux sociaux.

<p><strong><i>About Me</i></strong></p>
<p>My name is Felipe Correa and I’m the Founder of Easybici Chile, an e-mobility company that uses electric bike (e-bike) technology to implement sustainable transportation projects in areas that experience high-impact tourism.  Our company focuses on two strategic areas: Tourism and local communities that support tourism.</p>
<p>I was born in Santiago, Chile but grew up in the United States. Since my early days as a Boy Scout in California I had always been fascinated by the outdoors; it had everything I ever needed—big rocks to climb and shiny rivers to swim in. As I got older and, hopefully, more aware, I started to learn about how people and responsible companies that offer sustainable tourism alternatives can have a huge impact on the health of the environment.  That knowledge, coupled with my professional interests as an entrepreneur, led me to establishing my own sustainable tourism business in tourist-heavy communities that offer little to no sustainable transportation alternatives. </p>
<p>Easybici Chile started in early 2015 with a fleet of 20 e-bikes for tourists to visit popular attractions in and around Santiago, Chile.  In a short time, we have experienced real demand serving over 3,000 tourists and growing!  Because of our sustainable model, we have been awarded the CORFO national seed funding award (2015) and the Santiago regional seed funding award (2015)—awards given to organizations that are making an impact by implementing innovative business ideas that have a positive impact on the environment.  <i>(CORFO is a Chilean government entity that supports and finances up and coming industries.)</i></p>
<p>With our success and experience in Santiago, we set out to explore opportunities to make a difference on Easter Island, one of the top tourism destinations in Chile.  We established Easybici Chile on Easter Island in July of 2015 with a fleet of 17 e-bikes and have served over 2,000 clients to date. </p>
<p>Because of our tourism business, we’ve become part of the local Chamber of Commerce, which has allowed us to learn first-hand about the unsustainable growth challenges of the island, particularly on the transportation side. This project for a sustainable e-bike transportation project is a first step towards addressing some of these challenges.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>The Project</strong></i></p>
<p>Phase one of our project on Easter Island started in 2015 with the establishment of a fleet of 17 e-bikes for tourists to visit popular attractions around the island.  With the ""pedal assist"" features of an e-bike, which makes a ride over 30 kilometers while climbing hills pretty much effortless, and the reduction in CO2 emissions from using an e-bike instead of a car or bus, makes the e-bike the ideal transportation alternative to motorized vehicles and traditional bicycles.</p>
<p>Although bicycles provide the greatest health benefits and lowest environmental impact, they are not an ideal option for the physical realities of riding long distances against strong island winds and over hilly terrain.  Nor are they an ideal option for tourists who want to maximize their time, effort and comfort as they get around the island.  Without an alternative like the e-bikes, tourists will opt for the only other option on the island—cars and buses—which will only add to the traffic, noise and pollution that are already a problem.</p>
<p>Since 2015, our e-bike rental business on Easter Island has served over 2,000 riders from over 45 countries, typically between the ages of 35 and 65.  The impact of these riders renting an e-bike over a car or hopping on a bus is real and tangible, and we now want to make this even bigger!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to move beyond tourism and implement phase two—a scalable, sustainable transportation pilot project for the local community of Easter Island. Once funding is secured, we will set up a centrally located station in Hanga Roa, the main city on Easter Island, which is home to 87% of the population.  The station, which is the same recycled shipping container that we use for our tourism business, will hold 20 e-bikes and be staffed by attendants who will register riders, manage the e-bike loans, maintain the equipment, and collect information to track our progress.</p>
<p>For this pilot project, the e-bikes will be for the exclusive use of public employees (such as national park employees and civil servants) who have specific and regular transportation needs during the week. We will work with them to collect a variety of information to determine the project’s success and, if it is, plan the strategy for phase 3—securing government and private sector support to expand the program to multiple stations throughout the island, and making e-bikes available at no-cost to all residents of island. </p>
<p>CORFO, the government agency dedicated to promoting investment, innovation and entrepreneurship to achieve sustainable development, is developing a strategic initiative to make Easter Island a model of sustainability for high impact tourism destinations by 2025. Our e-bike project is aligned with these goals.</p>
<p>This sustainable project is based on a solid foundation—our experience and success from our e-bike rental services.  Thanks to our tourism arm, we are already on the island making a difference every day.  <strong>We hope that you will be as excited as we are about the possibility to make a huge impact on the environmental health of Easter Island and the quality of life of it’s residents by partnering with us on this project!</strong></p>

<p><i><strong>Use of Proceeds</strong></i></p>
<p>The budget to fund the pilot project for the first year is $80,000.  This includes fixed start-up costs for a fleet of 20 e-bikes (valued at $2,000 each with shipping), a modified shipping container to store the bikes ($4,000), e-bike parts ($6,000), safety equipment ($2,000), and working capital (mostly personnel $28,000).  One hundred percent of the funds raised will go towards the development and execution of the project.</p>
<p>After the first year we´re confident that the project will attract enough sponsorship to cover the overhead of additional e-bikes and stations, ongoing personnel and maintenance.</p>
<p>If we don´t reach our goal of $80,000, we will start the project by investing in fewer e-bikes. The project is viable and can have an impact with as few as ten bikes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Contribution Perks!</strong></i></p>
<p>For your support we have some cool perks!  Depending on your giving level, these can include digital postcard updates of the project, a one-on-one video chat with our crew on Easter Island, a one-of-a-kind contribution certificate designed and signed by a local artist, and a complimentary VIP e-bike tour for Easter Island or Santiago, Chile. </p>
<p>The impact you´ll be making is real, tangible and immediate.  By far, the biggest perk is that you’ll be partnering with us in an effort to create a more sustainable environment on one of the most unique places on earth.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><i>Risks and Challenges</i></strong></p>
<p>On Easter Island there are always challenges.  Luckily, our experience from phase one (sustainable tourism) taught us a lot about how to work in such a remote place.  Some of these challenges include not being able to order replacement parts quickly (there is no overnight express service to the island) and the increased risk for rust due to the humidity and salinity of the air.  But all of these challenges can be addressed with a comprehensive maintenance plan and a well-trained staff. </p>

</div></div>","About Me
My name is Felipe Correa and I’m the Founder of Easybici Chile, an e-mobility company that uses electric bike (e-bike) technology to implement sustainable transportation projects in areas that experience high-impact tourism.  Our company focuses on two strategic areas: Tourism and local communities that support tourism.
I was born in Santiago, Chile but grew up in the United States. Since my early days as a Boy Scout in California I had always been fascinated by the outdoors; it had everything I ever needed—big rocks to climb and shiny rivers to swim in. As I got older and, hopefully, more aware, I started to learn about how people and responsible companies that offer sustainable tourism alternatives can have a huge impact on the health of the environment.  That knowledge, coupled with my professional interests as an entrepreneur, led me to establishing my own sustainable tourism business in tourist-heavy communities that offer little to no sustainable transportation alternatives. 
Easybici Chile started in early 2015 with a fleet of 20 e-bikes for tourists to visit popular attractions in and around Santiago, Chile.  In a short time, we have experienced real demand serving over 3,000 tourists and growing!  Because of our sustainable model, we have been awarded the CORFO national seed funding award (2015) and the Santiago regional seed funding award (2015)—awards given to organizations that are making an impact by implementing innovative business ideas that have a positive impact on the environment.  (CORFO is a Chilean government entity that supports and finances up and coming industries.)
With our success and experience in Santiago, we set out to explore opportunities to make a difference on Easter Island, one of the top tourism destinations in Chile.  We established Easybici Chile on Easter Island in July of 2015 with a fleet of 17 e-bikes and have served over 2,000 clients to date. 
Because of our tourism business, we’ve become part of the local Chamber of Commerce, which has allowed us to learn first-hand about the unsustainable growth challenges of the island, particularly on the transportation side. This project for a sustainable e-bike transportation project is a first step towards addressing some of these challenges.
 
The Project
Phase one of our project on Easter Island started in 2015 with the establishment of a fleet of 17 e-bikes for tourists to visit popular attractions around the island.  With the ""pedal assist"" features of an e-bike, which makes a ride over 30 kilometers while climbing hills pretty much effortless, and the reduction in CO2 emissions from using an e-bike instead of a car or bus, makes the e-bike the ideal transportation alternative to motorized vehicles and traditional bicycles.
Although bicycles provide the greatest health benefits and lowest environmental impact, they are not an ideal option for the physical realities of riding long distances against strong island winds and over hilly terrain.  Nor are they an ideal option for tourists who want to maximize their time, effort and comfort as they get around the island.  Without an alternative like the e-bikes, tourists will opt for the only other option on the island—cars and buses—which will only add to the traffic, noise and pollution that are already a problem.
Since 2015, our e-bike rental business on Easter Island has served over 2,000 riders from over 45 countries, typically between the ages of 35 and 65.  The impact of these riders renting an e-bike over a car or hopping on a bus is real and tangible, and we now want to make this even bigger!


 
Our goal is to move beyond tourism and implement phase two—a scalable, sustainable transportation pilot project for the local community of Easter Island. Once funding is secured, we will set up a centrally located station in Hanga Roa, the main city on Easter Island, which is home to 87% of the population.  The station, which is the same recycled shipping container that we use for our tourism business, will hold 20 e-bikes and be staffed by attendants who will register riders, manage the e-bike loans, maintain the equipment, and collect information to track our progress.
For this pilot project, the e-bikes will be for the exclusive use of public employees (such as national park employees and civil servants) who have specific and regular transportation needs during the week. We will work with them to collect a variety of information to determine the project’s success and, if it is, plan the strategy for phase 3—securing government and private sector support to expand the program to multiple stations throughout the island, and making e-bikes available at no-cost to all residents of island. 
CORFO, the government agency dedicated to promoting investment, innovation and entrepreneurship to achieve sustainable development, is developing a strategic initiative to make Easter Island a model of sustainability for high impact tourism destinations by 2025. Our e-bike project is aligned with these goals.
This sustainable project is based on a solid foundation—our experience and success from our e-bike rental services.  Thanks to our tourism arm, we are already on the island making a difference every day.  We hope that you will be as excited as we are about the possibility to make a huge impact on the environmental health of Easter Island and the quality of life of it’s residents by partnering with us on this project!
 


Use of Proceeds
The budget to fund the pilot project for the first year is $80,000.  This includes fixed start-up costs for a fleet of 20 e-bikes (valued at $2,000 each with shipping), a modified shipping container to store the bikes ($4,000), e-bike parts ($6,000), safety equipment ($2,000), and working capital (mostly personnel $28,000).  One hundred percent of the funds raised will go towards the development and execution of the project.
After the first year we´re confident that the project will attract enough sponsorship to cover the overhead of additional e-bikes and stations, ongoing personnel and maintenance.
If we don´t reach our goal of $80,000, we will start the project by investing in fewer e-bikes. The project is viable and can have an impact with as few as ten bikes.
 
Contribution Perks!
For your support we have some cool perks!  Depending on your giving level, these can include digital postcard updates of the project, a one-on-one video chat with our crew on Easter Island, a one-of-a-kind contribution certificate designed and signed by a local artist, and a complimentary VIP e-bike tour for Easter Island or Santiago, Chile. 
The impact you´ll be making is real, tangible and immediate.  By far, the biggest perk is that you’ll be partnering with us in an effort to create a more sustainable environment on one of the most unique places on earth.
 

Risks and Challenges
On Easter Island there are always challenges.  Luckily, our experience from phase one (sustainable tourism) taught us a lot about how to work in such a remote place.  Some of these challenges include not being able to order replacement parts quickly (there is no overnight express service to the island) and the increased risk for rust due to the humidity and salinity of the air.  But all of these challenges can be addressed with a comprehensive maintenance plan and a well-trained staff.

Credit:  National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)“Undersea noise pollution is like the death of a thousand cuts. Each sound in itself may not be a matter of critical concern, but taken all together, the noise from shipping, seismic surveys, and military activity is creating a totally different environment than existed even 50 years ago. That high level of noise is bound to have a hard, sweeping impact on life in the sea.”-Dr. Sylvia Earle, Former NOAA Chief ScientistWe are polluting the seas with
sound.






Commercial shipping noise interrupts the hearing, navigation, and communication of whales, dolphins, and fish.
Noise from seismic exploration and offshore drilling scare dolphins and whales away from prime foraging prime areas.
Military sonar noise causes frightened whales to strand themselves on beaches and die.

The
world is waking up to the terrible consequences of noise pollution in the ocean.

Mounting
Concern About Underwater Noise Pollution Harming Marine Wildlife
http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/environment/mounting-concern-about-underwater-noise-pollution-harming-marine-wildlife.25062564

How do we control noise when it travels over vast ocean distances and does not
stop at national boundaries?
Noise pollution in the
ocean is an international problem that requires an international solution.
Right now there is no treaty to control
ocean noise and it is not officially classified as a marine pollutant. Some
nations have acted to try to manage noise along their coasts, but in the high
seas there is very little meaningful regulation.

We
have a unique window of opportunity.

In 2015, the United Nations will take up
the issue of whether to protect biodiversity in the high seas. We need to make
sure underwater noise pollution is considered in any action by the global community.
https://www.un.org/depts/los/biodiversityworkinggroup/biodiversityworkinggroup.htm
To support this
goal, in 2015 I will begin my Ph.D. project at the Australian National Centre for Ocean
Resources and Security, University of Wollongong. The project will explore
options for the international community to regulate underwater noise pollution generated by human activities in the high seas.


http://ancors.uow.edu.au/index.htmlu.au/index.html


The
product of my research will be a comprehensive book that offers practical solutions for the global management of underwater noise pollution and supports advocacy for quieter
oceans. The book will serve as a resource for scientists, policymakers, educators,
and conservationists.

<p>Most cities and towns around the world are located by the ocean, a sea or a river. Dumpsites are the de facto waste management option for many of these cities and towns.

<p>Dumpsites are also a major contributor to climate change and harm human health.  Illegal dumping and disposal practices often take the form of uncontrolled burning, accentuating the release of toxic gases that include furans and dioxins as well as black carbon, a climate pollutant.</p>

Our members are waste professionals from 110 countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America, North America, and Europe. We have expertise across all aspects of solid waste management. We are taking leadership on addressing global waste issues - including <a href=""https://marinelitter.iswa.org/marine-litter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">marine litter</a> and <a href=""http://closingdumpsites.iswa.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open dumpsites</a>.</p>

<p>ISWA is running a long term multi-year programme to raise awareness about dumpsites and deliver best-practice in helping communities to move towards sustainable waste management practices close dumpsites. </p>
<p>Closing dumpsites is neither simple nor quick.

We want to open up dialogue about our commonality with the people around us, despite apparent differences, and we want to bring peace to a world wrapped up in unrest. Second, it is to cultivate a deep passion for earth and the environment in our communities and faith groups.
What We Need & Why We Need It
 Our goal of $3000 goes to specific company needs (in order of importance):

$650 organization startup costs
$350 website costs
$500 miscellaneous/preparatory fund
$1000 work stipend for full-time work commitment
$500 prize costs (approx.)                                                                                                 The Impact Our organization has a unique goal of fostering community through interfaith dialogue, using a common love for the environment as a conduit for this dialogue.  We represent faith groups in specific regions, allowing for regional community building, and representation of individual faith groups
We have had positive feedback from each faith group we have contacted so far, and have received significant support from the interfaith, collegiate, and environmental community. 
 We exist entirely for the benefit of the community, the faith groups we represent, and for a more sustainable earth.    
Possible Risks
Nothing is easy, and starting a non-profit organization has many risks:
  Our organization relies entirely on support from the interfaith community, so if the faith groups aren't interested, the organization won't fulfill its role
It is sometimes difficult to find a common tongue, and be relatable to representatives from many different faiths             
We intend to do everything we can to be relatable to representatives from many different faith traditions, and overcome these possible risks with perseverance and creativity

<p><b>The Program</b></p>
<p>Teens live as a group in the wilderness at the Wigwams Rapid on the Machias
River. They work with our staff, agencies and volunteers doing river habitat
restoration and trail work.The program has been designed to blend three
important experiences for young adults:  it is one-third overnight camp
experience, one-third school, and one-third summer job. The Wigwams Program
eliminates common barriers for young people from our area to participate in
summer camps meaningful summer employment and the same time that it builds
their skills they can actually build careers around. Participants in the MRWP
have the chance to experience the camaraderie, humor and community of a camp,
but also learn from visiting outdoor professionals. They are expected to
contribute hard work and long days under the direction of group leaders who act
as teachers and mentors rather than as traditional bosses. The program takes
place in July so that participants can still work the wild blueberry harvest in
August. The Machias River Wigwams Program strives to build skills for a
comprehensive suite of outdoor recreation and outdoor careers that includes a
wide range of disciplines from nature-based art to sustainable forestry to fish
biology and wilderness trip leading - all built around a deep care for the
beautiful Machias River watershed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445198/files/20140319104328-999077_493074257446057_2140555993_n.jpg?1395251008"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

<p><b>Why is something like this necessary?</b></p>
<p>This is necessary because Maine is the last chance to maintain wild Atlantic
salmon in the United States, and this restoration effort is the perfect
opportunity for local teens to emerge from simply living here into stewards and
outdoor professionals.</p>
<p>The Downeast Salmon Federation was founded by local anglers in 1982 to
address the decline of the wild Atlantic salmon in the northeast United
States.  The Wigwams Program builds on 32 years of habitat protection and
restoration  in the Downeast region. However, since this once-famous
salmon fishery has been closed, today’s generations do not have memories of
catching sea-run salmon or a concept of the salmon as a public resource and
responsibility.  This brings the next generation of Washington County
youth into engagement and action around our watershed. While Washington County
kids are surrounded by some of the least developed forests and watersheds on
the east coast, many of them do not have access to outdoor experiences because
of financial barriers and lack of skills on the part of their parents. This
program strives to help youth who want to stay in Washington County find their
own ""recipe"" to do it.</p>

<p><b>HOT PERKS</b></p>
<p>All contributions are appreciated. The perks we offer contributors are

at DSF's rustic camps. Learn learn more about the camps in the following
descriptions.</p>
<p><b>The Camps</b></p>
<p>The “Camp” is a traditional and current part of Maine culture. Camps might

of structure where people get away from the demands of daily life. Year after
year, families and friends head “upta’ camp” to fish, bond with each other,
goof off and unplug.</p>
<p>We are offering contributors the opportunity to stay at the Downeast Salmon
Federation's rustic Maine camps. These camps have wood stoves but no
electricity, and sleep between 4 and 10 people - each one of the 3 camps is
located in a different secluded place along the Machias or the Narraguagus
River. </p>
<p><b>The Wigwams</b> sleeps 7 and is accessible by 4WD vehicle, or 2WD vehicle

We plan to make a documentary that follows our journey to become more self-sufficient while establishing our mini farm as a community resource to help others see what is possible and that it can be done. Many people in the U.S. feel that they need to change the way they live but are afraid to take the first step or don't know where to start. We will take that first step for them by becoming their support system, helping them decide where they will construct their gardens and other small support structures taking into consideration their land size, layout of their property, physical abilities of all household members, free time available to work the land, etc. We want to know what their goals are and help them to reach those goals, whether it is saving thousands of dollars yearly on food or more ambitious goals that include generating extra income. This may allow a mother to have more time with her children or a retiree to live more comfortably on a fixed income. For a family in danger of losing their home, it may very well tip the balance in their favor.</span></p>

Did you know that on just a quarter of an acre of land, you can grow enough to provide over 4/5 or 80% of the yearly food consumed by a family of 3 plus have a surplus left over to sell at the local markets? By using intensive farming methods, a ""mini farmer"" can produce as much in 1400 square feet as a conventional farmer can on 3/4 of an acre! (Source: ""Mini Farming"", by Brett L. Markham)
My name is Jeanine. I live with my husband, Bendar, and my son, Rohnin, in Clyde, Ohio.  As of November, 2011, Ohio's unemployment rate was 8.5% (from http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/lauhsthl.htm) with many of Ohio's counties in our area at a higher rate than that, not to mention the unemployment rate in the rest of the United States and beyond! The jobs that are available are the lowest paying in recent history and certainly come with little to no benefits. In addition, food and energy prices are continuously rising. 
People are going deeper into debt just to feed their families and put gas in their tanks. What if they knew that they could take their land, even if it's just a few hundred square feet, and turn it into a mini farming operation that would save them thousands of dollars on food every year and even generate revenue by selling surplus produce at the local markets? How much gas money could they save by taking fewer trips to the grocery store and eliminate the need to drive to a second job that is now unnecessary?
Mini Farm Project Sustainability aims to answer these questions and provide the people in our community and beyond with the tools they need to save money, generate income, and harvest fresh, healthy produce from their own mini gardens by using intensive farming techniques. We plan to make a documentary that follows our journey to become more self-sufficient while establishing our mini farm as a community resource to help others see what is possible and that it can be done. Many people in the U.S. feel that they need to change the way they live but are afraid to take the first step or don't know where to start. We will take that first step for them by becoming their support system, helping them decide where they will construct their gardens and other small support structures taking into consideration their land size, layout of their property, physical abilities of all household members, free time available to work the land, etc. We want to know what their goals are and help them to reach those goals, whether it is saving thousands of dollars yearly on food or more ambitious goals that include generating extra income. This may allow a mother to have more time with her children or a retiree to live more comfortably on a fixed income. For a family in danger of losing their home, it may very well tip the balance in their favor.
We will accomplish our ultimate goal in the spring of 2013 when we open a community garden where we host classes on mini farming and let people who have no land access grow their own crops on our land to save money on their food bill, freeing up income for other needs. Learning how to grow, harvest, and preserve crops will help people in our community and beyond to become more self-sufficient and therefore empowered to help themselves and others. We are hoping those we help will go on to become successful mini farmers and help other future mini farmers! We do not have, nor do we wish to have, a monopoly on this information. 
 
The intensive farming methods we wish to employ include, but are by no means limited to: 
- Planting crops in raised beds versus traditional rows which raises the temperature of the soil by around 10 degrees, thereby extending the growing season.
- Planting crops closer together, eliminating the need to weed, which will drastically cut down on the workload.
- Planting cover crops to replenish nutrients, keep soil in place, and create green manure. 
- Thermophilic composting to kill pathogens and turn table scraps, animal manures, and green manures into nutrient-dense compost that will replenish soil depleted by growing crops.
- Covering raised beds with an inexpensive frame & plastic sheet, making it possible to extend the growing season to January, even in northern states.
- Using natural pest control to protect crop yields and prevent chemical insecticides and fungicides from contaminating crops by eliminating the need to use them.
- Preserving the harvests for later consumption using canning, vacuum-packing, freezing, storing via root cellar, and other preservation methods.
- Saving open-pollinated seeds from crop plants that flourished, eliminating the need to purchase seeds for the next crop year and increasing the chances of a more productive future harvest.
 
Do you want to learn more about intensive farming techniques? I recommend these books, though there are countless resources on this subject:
Mini Farming: Self Sufficiency on 1/4 Acre, by Brett L. Markham
The Backyard Homestead: Produce all the food you need on just a quarter acre!, by Carleen Madigan
The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City, by Kelly Coyne & Erik Knutzen
The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It, by John Seymour
 
The Impact
If we are not able to raise the funds we need by July, the consequence is that it will take us much longer - likely years - to save the money we need to start mentoring people who are hungry for this knowledge. We need to get started this summer by preparing the land for crop growth, starting thermophilic compost, and reaching out to our immediate community and beyond through farmers markets, health food stores, community organizations, and especially through developing and dispersing our mini farming documentary. 
We live on rented land. According to park rules, we are not allowed to have the small, 20 square foot garden that we dug four years ago, but others in our park have tomato plants and small gardens, so for the time being, the landlord is letting this slide. I tried to grow medicinal herbs a couple years ago only to discover that my landlord had decided to dig up and mulch the area I had planted them which destroyed all of my plants. It is very limited what we are allowed to do on our rented lot, and I know there are many people who are in a similar situation or who don't have any land at all. This inability to work the land is why we need your help. If we already had our own land to start even a few hundred square feet of raised beds, believe me, we already would have done it, and we would not have the need to humbly ask for your help!
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need $10,000 that will go directly towards the down payment on a parcel of workable farm land on at least 2 acres. That's it. We are not asking for money to buy a pre-built greenhouse or truck in loads of bricks to surround the raised beds. We will build this mini farm as cost-effective as possible once we have the land by doing the work with a spade and garden fork, double digging the raised beds and surrounding them with low-cost wood or free cement blocks - whatever we can get our hands on. The $10,000 will simply allow us make a down payment to acquire the property - we will supply the man and woman power! 
Time line of our project:
February - August (ongoing) 2012: Use intensive farming techniques in our 20 square foot garden on rented land. We will share our experiences with this endeavor in the documentary and on our website http://minifarmproject.com/, then apply this knowledge on a larger scale to the newly acquired parcel of land, comparing crop yields from conventional farming techniques that we had used in previous years.
April: $10,000 funding goal reached. A savings account will be opened which will be used solely to hold these funds for land purchase.
July: Apply for loan pre-approval while locating a suitable property.
August: Purchase property.
September: Dig raised beds. We plan to double dig at least 300 square feet of raised beds with plans to dig more as we have the resources including time and funds. To put this square footage into perspective, using intensive gardening practices, if we planted only one crop - carrots, we should be able to harvest 900 pounds of them in one growing season!
October: Attain straw, start thermophilic compost pile, plant cover crops.
November: Piece together video footage from February all the way to the current time, giving viewers an intimate view of the beginnings of our mini farm. We will distribute the work in progress with plans to expand on the documentary in the spring of 2013 when we begin preparing for the first crop year.
December 2012 â€“ February 2013: Develop our teaching curriculum, drawing from our experiences up to the current time and reaching out to more knowledgeable mentors in our area and beyond to help decide the best approaches to teaching intensive farming techniques. We will also start advertising our class dates/times at local farmerâ€™s markets, health food stores, websites, etc. 
March: Start seedling indoors and begin preparing the land that will be used by students (prepare raised bed and compost areas as well as connect water supply to the area for crop watering/irrigation). 
May: Plant our first big crop and begin our first mini farm classes.
If we raise additional money over the $10,000, it will allow us to:
- Buy a slightly bigger parcel than we originally planned, accelerating our plans to help the community by providing more workable land to those who have none.
- Dig more raised beds than the 300 square feet we are currently planning in the fall before winter comes, making it possible to plant more cover crops to create green manure for composting and plant more food crops in the spring.
- Spend more time working on our documentary, making it available to the international community in a more timely manner.
As a way to say thank you for your generosity, we have 8 perk levels for you to claim that range from $5 to $1000 that we will be overjoyed to give to you!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello friends.</p>
<p>Are you wanting to become more involved in the animal rights community but don't know how or where to start?!</p>
<p>On May 26, 2018 in Zagreb, a peaceful march will be held to demand the closure of all slaughterhouses and to end the violence that we inflict on non-human animals. We will be joined by compassionate citizens, who will march in solidarity.</p>
<p>As a society, we have marched against sexism, racism, and homophobia. Now, we ask you to join us to march against another oppression: speciesism. Our fellow non-human Earthlings desperately need us to act against their continuous pain and suffering at the hands of an animal-eating society. Meat, dairy, and egg consumption cause more suffering and death than any other human activity and are completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>It is estimated that every year 1,000-billion aquatic animals are killed worldwide. That's 1,902,588 every minute or 31,710 every second. And, even worse, it's estimated that each year 64-billion land animals are killed worldwide for the appetite of humans (or 121,766 every minute and 2,029 every second).</p>
<p>It's time to state clearly the necessity to abolish nonhuman slavery, and oppose the practices that exploit, torture, and murder animals. Please join us for this critical event and speak out on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. This march is part of a movement needed to permanently shut down all slaughterhouses and will ultimately awaken the greatest transformation of humankind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In addition that organizing the protest requires time, dedication, consistency, many people are involved arbitrarily and voluntarily, unforeseen situations arise, but some parts of organizing the march inevitably generate the costs. Costs of march organization are roughly $ 5.000,00 and include stage setup, proclamation, required noise measurement by the City of Zagreb, power supply,  stand setup, announcement of march, making, printing and placating posters around the city. As part of the event, a concert will be held where special performers are invited – Darko Rundek and band ŽEN.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you can directly support our strive to spread the message of compassion and kindness, and influence people not only in Croatia but worldwide to become aware that animals are not ours to consume, wear, torture or experiment on. They are not here for our enterainment. You also support a long-term vision that generation of our children, and the one after that, will not have to fight this fight! So that they can live in a world free from disconnect, cruelty and suffering. A world where all animals live safe, happy and free. Peace begins on your plate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So this is our 3rd march in Zagreb. More and more people recognize how much the importance of action is and march is expanding to other countries as well. This year, activists from Serbia decided to start on organizing their first international march of this type.</p>
<p>We organized two marches in 2017. On March 11, 2017 was held ""1. International Protest ANIMAL LIBERATION for Closing All Slaughterhouses“ and May 27, 2017 ""2. International Protest ANIMAL LIBERATION for Closing All Slaughterhouses "". The idea developed in line with the international ""March to Close all Slaughterhouses"" event that began in Paris and is now held every year in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK, Australia, USA, Canada, Brazil.</p>

Hello friends.
Are you wanting to become more involved in the animal rights community but don't know how or where to start?!
On May 26, 2018 in Zagreb, a peaceful march will be held to demand the closure of all slaughterhouses and to end the violence that we inflict on non-human animals. We will be joined by compassionate citizens, who will march in solidarity.
As a society, we have marched against sexism, racism, and homophobia. Now, we ask you to join us to march against another oppression: speciesism. Our fellow non-human Earthlings desperately need us to act against their continuous pain and suffering at the hands of an animal-eating society. Meat, dairy, and egg consumption cause more suffering and death than any other human activity and are completely unnecessary.
It is estimated that every year 1,000-billion aquatic animals are killed worldwide. That's 1,902,588 every minute or 31,710 every second. And, even worse, it's estimated that each year 64-billion land animals are killed worldwide for the appetite of humans (or 121,766 every minute and 2,029 every second).
It's time to state clearly the necessity to abolish nonhuman slavery, and oppose the practices that exploit, torture, and murder animals. Please join us for this critical event and speak out on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. This march is part of a movement needed to permanently shut down all slaughterhouses and will ultimately awaken the greatest transformation of humankind.

What We Need & What You Get
In addition that organizing the protest requires time, dedication, consistency, many people are involved arbitrarily and voluntarily, unforeseen situations arise, but some parts of organizing the march inevitably generate the costs. Costs of march organization are roughly $ 5.000,00 and include stage setup, proclamation, required noise measurement by the City of Zagreb, power supply,  stand setup, announcement of march, making, printing and placating posters around the city. As part of the event, a concert will be held where special performers are invited – Darko Rundek and band ŽEN.
By contributing to our campaign you can directly support our strive to spread the message of compassion and kindness, and influence people not only in Croatia but worldwide to become aware that animals are not ours to consume, wear, torture or experiment on. They are not here for our enterainment. You also support a long-term vision that generation of our children, and the one after that, will not have to fight this fight! So that they can live in a world free from disconnect, cruelty and suffering. A world where all animals live safe, happy and free. Peace begins on your plate.

The Impact
So this is our 3rd march in Zagreb. More and more people recognize how much the importance of action is and march is expanding to other countries as well. This year, activists from Serbia decided to start on organizing their first international march of this type.
We organized two marches in 2017. On March 11, 2017 was held ""1. International Protest ANIMAL LIBERATION for Closing All Slaughterhouses“ and May 27, 2017 ""2. International Protest ANIMAL LIBERATION for Closing All Slaughterhouses "". The idea developed in line with the international ""March to Close all Slaughterhouses"" event that began in Paris and is now held every year in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Turkey, the UK, Australia, USA, Canada, Brazil.
