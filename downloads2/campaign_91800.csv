<p>Pear OS 8 is a French distribution. It was created by David Tavares, Deux-Sèvres (79), France. The purpose of Pear OS is to create an operating system based on linux (ubuntu mini remix) and propose a simple but powerful interface.</p>
<p>Pear OS is free (thanks to your donations) and we hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p>It is operating out of the box, with a complete multimedia experienceand is extremely easy to use.

<p>Do you remember when things were simpler? When you could operate a device with just 2 simple dials? One to change volume and one to change channel, no more, no less. We have made it our mission to bring back that simplicity to todays over-complicated applications and we started with the remote control.</p>

<p>The average household has 3 remote controls laying around in the living room, with about 40 buttons each. Do we really need 120 buttons to choose from when all we want to do is watch TV, play a movie or listen to the radio? The remote control has become too complex, we want to change this.</p>

<p align=""center"" style=""color: #828587; font-size: 85%;""><i>Do we really need yet another remote for every device we buy?</i></p>
<p>We strongly believe that technology should make our lives easier, not over-complicate it. With SPIN remote we want to bring back simplicity. We do this by bringing together what you really use and stripping away all that you don’t really need. A simple solution for a complex problem.</p>

<p>SPIN remote is the remote control revolutionized. A remote control shouldn’t have so many buttons, while you only use a handful. In fact, we believe that it shouldn’t have buttons at all. With SPIN remote you can do what comes naturally; turn rotation and touch into action.</p>

<p>SPIN remote connects your existing Infrared equipment to your smart home and it offers a tangible interface to your smart devices. Boundaries start to fade, as you can just as easily control your non-networked TV as you can dim your smart lights.</p>

<p>SPIN remote sends out infrared signals in every direction, so gone are the days when you had to point your remote control towards your equipment. Touching SPIN remote is enough to activate it and let the magic happen.</p>

<p>SPIN remote is packed with sensors to detect motion, rotation, orientation and touch. These are used to determine the position it’s in and the action that’s performed. That’s how SPIN remote can seamlessly transform your actions into commands your equipment will understand.

And the best thing about all of this innovative technology: You don’t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>Your SPIN remote comes with a free App that will guide you through the setup process in just a few simple steps.

In its most simple form you just select the function you want to add (for example “volume up”), press the button on your old remote and you’re done! You can now use SPIN remote to control your volume, just as we’ve shown in our video (hold it sideways and rotate clockwise).</p>

<p>The more we spoke with friends, family and funders, the more ideas we got on how we could make SPIN remote even better. Even though most of these ideas are still being looked into, we are excited to share a few of them with you. Depending on your feedback, we might even turn some of them into stretch goals. Be sure to check back often, because we are planning to announce new ideas every week.</p>
<h4>Find Me</h4>
<p>Did you know that the average TV viewer spends about two weeks looking for lost remotes during their lifetime (<a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9776219/TV-viewers-spend-two-weeks-looking-for-lost-remote-during-their-lifetime.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">article</a>)? If you ask us, looking for a remote control should be a thing of the past.
<br/><br/>
That’s how the idea was born of having a ‘Find Me’ button in the App. Pressing it will cause SPIN remote to start sounding its buzzer and flashing its LEDs so you will have it back in no-time.
<br/><br/>
<b>Status:</b> We love this idea so much, that we decided to include this feature in our first release.</p>
<h4>API / SDK</h4>
<p>The feedback we got from funders and fellow developers was clear. You want to use SPIN remote exactly as you want it, so we will provide the tools to do so. We will develop an API / SDK that will allow you to control SPIN remote. You will be able to set its properties, send out Infrared commands and receive rotation and touch events.
<br/><br/>
<b>Status:</b> We already decided to turn this idea into reality. We did not plan to include the API / SDK in our initial release, but depending on your feedback it could end up being a stretch goal.</p>
<h4>SPIN spider</h4>
<p>Some of our funders shared that all of their A/V equipment is placed in a closed cabinet and that they have to open the cabinet doors every time they want to use their remotes (since Infrared doesn’t travel through them). While we can’t change the laws of physics, we can come up with a simple solution for them as well.
<br/><br/>
That’s how the idea was born to link together multiple SPIN remotes (via Bluetooth) and to develop an affordable add-on that will allow Infrared signals to travel past any blockades (cabinet shelves, other equipment). You could place 1 SPIN remote with your equipment and keep the doors closed while you use the other to control your equipment.
<br/><br/>
<b>Status:</b> We have determined that the idea is technically feasible and we have created a 3D impression of what the add-on could look like (below). Depending on your feedback, it could end up being a stretch goal.</p>

<p>SPIN remote is a high tech product that requires innovative hardware and software to work together seamlessly. We have already done a lot of testing with our early prototypes to make sure that SPIN remote meets all of our requirements, but as with every project there may still be some challenges down the road.

<p>Even though SPIN remote can talk with smart devices, it is primarily meant for your non-networked equipment and your not-so-smart HDTV (that use Infrared). If you are using an Infrared remote to control your equipment right now, then SPIN remote is able to learn from it and replace it.</p>
<p><a name=""faq-technical-smart-devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b>Technical - With what smart devices does SPIN remote work?</b></p>
<p>When designing SPIN remote we paid extra attention to energy efficiency and connectivity, that's why it's equiped with a Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 module (BLE for short). So to start off with SPIN remote can communicate with any device that contains a Bluetooth 4.0 type radio, often indicated as a BLE, Bluetooth Smart or Smart Ready device. When wanting to control Wi-Fi or Internet enabled devices, the App can function as a bridge. Meaning that it connects to both SPIN remote to receive rotation events (via Bluetooth) and your networked device (via Wi-Fi).
<br/><br/>
As you see, the possibilities are endless! With SPIN remote you can control your Infrared equipment, talk to your Bluetooth smart devices and use the App to get networked.</p>
<p><a name=""faq-technical-surface"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b>Technical - Does SPIN remote work on any surface?</b></p>
<p>Yes it does! As you've seen in the video, it even works in mid-air.</p>
<p><a name=""faq-technical-batteries"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b>Technical - How long do the batteries last?</b></p>
<p>Although the battery life of any product strongly depends on its use, we are aiming for at least 6 months with normal use. As you can expect from us, we have made it very easy to replace the batteries (3x CR2032).</p>
<p><a name=""faq-technical-infrared"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b>Technical - Why does SPIN remote have 6 Infrared LEDs, while my old remote has only one?</b></p>
<p>Your old remote has only one Infrared LED, which is mounted in the front. As a result you are forced to pick it up and point it towards your equipment. SPIN remote sends out Infrared signals in every direction, making pointing your remote a thing of the past.</p>
<p><a name=""faq-technical-apple-tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><b>Technical - Will SPIN remote work with my Apple TV?</b></p>
<p>Yes, and there are several ways to do so. Probably the easiest one is to learn the Infrared commands directly from your Apple Remote using the SPIN remote App. Another option is to add SPIN remote as a third-party remote control using the Apple TV itself (see the link below). Either way you have 6 functions to setup: up, down, left, right, select and menu.
<br/><br/>
The smart touchpad at the bottom of SPIN remote can be divided into 5 segments: a smaller button in the middle and 4 larger ones which each make up 1/4th of the remaining circle. You can setup each segment to perform a different function when pressed once or twice. What makes the touchpad so smart is that you don't ever have to figure out how you're holding it. Just think of it as a compass; your arrow up function will always be the key that's facing up (North), independent of how you're holding it (and thus just as you would expect).
<br/><br/>
For the Apple TV it would make sense to setup the arrow keys as you would expect and setup select and menu for either 1 or 2 taps on the center button.

Help spread the word and help increase compatibility!</p></div>","Do you remember when things were simpler? When you could operate a device with just 2 simple dials? One to change volume and one to change channel, no more, no less. We have made it our mission to bring back that simplicity to todays over-complicated applications and we started with the remote control.
The remote control hasn’t really evolved since 1980. It is time for a revolution. Meet SPIN remote, the remote control of the future.




""SPIN enables ultimate comfort on your couch"" - Newsweek
""SPIN remote is a lean, green, button-fightin' machine. Meet the last remote you'll ever need"" - Atmel
""It's a fascinating concept, not least due to how it simplifies the sometimes complex remote control."" - Gadget Review
""Simple enough, and sporting a clean design free of all those buttons you never use, this might be a hit for your home."" - Daily Crowdfunder

The average household has 3 remote controls laying around in the living room, with about 40 buttons each. Do we really need 120 buttons to choose from when all we want to do is watch TV, play a movie or listen to the radio? The remote control has become too complex, we want to change this.

Do we really need yet another remote for every device we buy?
We strongly believe that technology should make our lives easier, not over-complicate it. With SPIN remote we want to bring back simplicity. We do this by bringing together what you really use and stripping away all that you don’t really need. A simple solution for a complex problem.

SPIN remote is the remote control revolutionized. A remote control shouldn’t have so many buttons, while you only use a handful. In fact, we believe that it shouldn’t have buttons at all. With SPIN remote you can do what comes naturally; turn rotation and touch into action.

The process for each prototype has been the same; Build it, test it, get feedback and improve.
SPIN remote connects your existing Infrared equipment to your smart home and it offers a tangible interface to your smart devices. Boundaries start to fade, as you can just as easily control your non-networked TV as you can dim your smart lights.

SPIN remote is the only remote you will ever need.

SPIN remote sends out infrared signals in every direction, so gone are the days when you had to point your remote control towards your equipment. Touching SPIN remote is enough to activate it and let the magic happen.

SPIN remote activates as soon as you touch it.

SPIN remote supports macros (or sequences), which means that you can for example turn on multiple devices at once.
SPIN remote not only transmits infrared signals, it can receive them as well. This feature is used to learn commands from your existing remote controls. Even though SPIN remote can talk with your smart devices via Bluetooth, it is primarily meant for your non-networked equipment and your not-so-smart HDTV.

SPIN remote can perform different functions depending on how it's held. For example to set the volume when held sideways.

SPIN remote can also talk with your smart devices. For example set it up to control your lights when held upside down.
SPIN remote is packed with sensors to detect motion, rotation, orientation and touch. These are used to determine the position it’s in and the action that’s performed. That’s how SPIN remote can seamlessly transform your actions into commands your equipment will understand.

And the best thing about all of this innovative technology: You don’t have to worry about it.

You can setup the touchpad for more advanced functions. For example to browse your TV guide or to control your Apple TV.

You can use the App to setup SPIN remote, after which you can even use your smartphone as a universal remote.

Your SPIN remote comes with a free App that will guide you through the setup process in just a few simple steps.

In its most simple form you just select the function you want to add (for example “volume up”), press the button on your old remote and you’re done! You can now use SPIN remote to control your volume, just as we’ve shown in our video (hold it sideways and rotate clockwise).


If you want more, you can always use the App to create your own presets, add new devices, configure the touchpad and combine function with rotation just the way you want.

Our main video showed you the basics, now let's talk about the more advanced features of SPIN remote.
Smart touchpad

Presets

Smart lighting


No matter how much time you spend on decorating your home, you always end up with those same plastic remotes laying on your coffee table. We want to change this.
We believe that your remote control should be personal.
It should fit in with what you already have and be different from the one everybody else has. That’s why we offer 5 different shells to choose from right from the start.

SPIN remote

The standard aluminum shell (as seen in the main video) that comes with the SPIN remote perk.
SPIN special

The polished aluminum shell with optional laser engraving that can be selected with the SPIN special perk.

The polished brass shell with optional laser engraving that can be selected with the SPIN special perk.
Escher Exclusive

An exclusive series of which only 250 will ever be made worldwide, with it you will be able to bring a true work of art into your living room.

Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972) is one of the world's most famous graphic artists. His art is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world. We are proud to share that SPIN remote has been exclusively licensed by the official M.C. Escher Foundation to use Bird / Fish (No. 22).

All M.C. Escher works copyright © The M.C. Escher Company B.V. -Baarn-Holland. All rights reserved. www.mcescher.com
Colored shells
Colored shells are available in matt black, matt white, matt orange, matt blue and matt red. For every $14 you add to your current perk, you are allowed to choose one extra colored shell (so add $28 for two, $42 for three, etc.). Before shipping you will receive a survey in which you can fill in the additional shells you selected.

Our matt black prototype has been developed using a process called anodizing.

No more plastic remotes, imagine how great this would look on your coffee table.
If for example you select the SPIN remote perk ($92) with worldwide shipping ($17) and you want to have an additional matt black shell ($14) your total would be $123. You will now receive both the standard aluminum shell and an additional matt black one.

<h3>The Daily Stunner?</h3>Zappower is one stop self-protection device for security personnel and commoners alike. With the increasing atrocities in the metro cities in India and abroad, we felt that women and common man should carry the safety devices with them to safeguard themselves from mugging and other attacks. But any additional device in the handbag or pocket is a burden and it is not meaningful to carry around if it is not used often. So we came up with the idea of making it a power bank for your smart phones and tablets that are always power hungry.<br/><br/>We have put in a lot of thought into making it the most useful companion not only for common man but for security guards, night watchmen and cops. Unlike firearms, batons that cause permanent damage and other physical means of fighting that inflict pain, Zappower ends the confrontation by temporarily disabling the assassins with a non-lethal powerful electric shock .</div><div>

<li>
<b>Powerful Stun Gun:</b> Intimidates the attacker with electric sparks and sound from distance but if the sight and sound doesn't stop one, a strong jolt from Zappower certainly will! Power packed with 20,000V electric shock, it neutralizes the attacker in seconds inducing temporary paralysis for few minutes through muscular atrophy </li>
<li>
<b>Battery Level Indicator:</b> Unique LED power level indicator tells you if it is time to charge!</li>
<li>
<b>Portable Power Bank:</b> Zappower charges mobile phones and other gadgets on-the-go! It is a reliable power backup with 4000mAh battery</li>
<li>
<b>Bright LED Flashlight:</b> The LED flashlight provides a convenient source of light in the dark eliminating the need to carry bulky flashlights</li>
<li>
<b>Rechargeable Battery with USB:</b> No need to buy/replace batteries for Zappower! With universal microUSB port, the built-in rechargeable Lion batteries can be charged using any mobile charger/laptop with greater ease.</li>
<li>
<b>Beauty &amp; the Beast:</b> With soft looks and comfortable grip Zappower is easy to hold but at the same time its sharp electrodes ruthlessly penetrate even through thick cloths. It sure has an element of surprise!</li>
<li>
<b>Simple design:</b> Compact size (Current dimensions: 5.5"" x 1.9"" x1"" and we are making it even smaller with the final version!) and low weight make it easier to carry around in one’s pocket!</li>
<li>
<b>Safety Switch (Updated!):</b> To prevent accidental discharge, two levels of safety (with extra switch) is built for the stun gun to operate </li>

This is me with the fanny pack at my first stationery booth in Brooklyn with a pink mustache.

It's been a couple of years since then and my little business has been growing!  The Memo Bandit has been featured at The National Stationery Show 2012 and one of my creations was listed on Refinery 29 under the Best of Etsy in New York (picture).
I'm here on Indieagogo because I do a lot of my designing and production from home.  Particularly when I'm creating prototypes for new designs or selling them from a little booth in Brooklyn.
I bought Mavis because my designs evolved from this -

It can charge and hold your iPhone 6/6s in just one simple action, making life more convenient.SonicPower works as a firm holder to your phone while driving.At the same time, it quick charge the phone. Make calls, listen to music and navigate without fumbling with your phone's power cord or worrying about your battery life.SonicPower makes wire-free charging both on the road and at home.The case doesn’t only charge your phone.It keeps your phone stylish and protected.Just enjoy a happy and satisfying charging experience with SonicPower!The conductive wireless charging is fulfilled by Pin Contact. When the charging works, the current goes from the car charger to the mount’s Pin. The Pin contacts the gilded electrode on the case and transfer the current forward. The current finally pass through the case to the Lightning connector. Convenient Charging: Place the phone on the mount and it begins to charge. It can be rotated in 360 degrees and adjusted to any display angle at will.Effective Charging: The gilded electrode and Pin are durable and corrosion resistant. The Pin Contact ensures a persistent and effective charging.Strong Magnetic Connection: There is a magnet circuit inside the mount. The magnitude of the magnetism is elaborately designed and adjusted. The phone stays firm attached even on bumpy roads. Quick Charging: On product charging speed test, SonicPower fully charges iPhone in less than 2 hours. 50% faster than Qi wireless charger in the market, which normally takes 4 hours.Charging Speed Test: when the navigation and other APPs are working, it takes iPhone 6 1h 56m 59s from 0 to 100% charged.Safe Charging: Charging safety is of primary importance to us. Therefore we have worked on every aspect to ensure its safety.  For the charging case, the Lightning connector is certified by Apple MFI, which can from the source avoid any unexpected problems that uncertified component brings. It also embeds circuit chip to control the current in a safe range and a smart chip that reads how much power the phone needs.
For the charging mount, the electronic components work together to avoid short-delay and transient current, ensuring the pin won’t short out in any case. The gilded Pin can defend against the natural corrosion effects of water, sweat and dust, which maintains a safe connection from its durable components.

All the embedded electronic components and material we selected are to make the charging process safe, reliable and stable.
The case offers not only a comfortable grip but also a reliable protection. It’s made of quality polycarbonate, which has a high stability that’s perfect for protecting the phone.
The widened flexible rubber on the top makes the case easy to attach and detach.
The case won't affect the Headphone Jack and Speaker's use.

Except the charging function, the case performs good in its daily use. Lightweight(1.4oz) but sturdy, it stylishly keeps the phone protected.

<p></p></div>","""RETIRE THE WIRES"" and change the WAY you listen to Audio!! In development our company Rootz Technology has created a prototype of an over-the-ear wireless, Bluetooth headphone complete with a built in 8GB Android device titled the SLD (Smart Listening Device). It is the world’s 1st full-size Smart headset that comes with an Android internal operating system allowing users to download their favorite media files directly to their Headset, and hold conversations via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi. NEVER again will a consumer be tangled up in wires or be out of reach of good music! Key Features:(Live footage of Android Interface and Video Playback)-Included with internal apps (e-Book reader, FM Radio, etc)- Built-in Pedometer to track exercise & steps- Audio-In Aux. Jack for those who still want the ""Wired"" option- Transfer files USB- Built In GPS- Download your Favorite Apps via Google Play Market- Stream Music Wireless via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi- 2 built in Internal Microphones for Phone Calls and Skype Conversations- 8GB Internal Memory (Multiple Storage Levels Coming Soon)Battery (expected)

Play time 8 hours
Standby time 200 hours
Charging time less than 1 hour
Charging: USB 
Type: Lithium Battery  
**Your pledge will help us deliver a friendly and discrete assistant that will enhance real life experiences. Buying devices that would equal the functions of The Smart Listening Device will set you back at least 600$.WHY WE NEED HELP FROM INDIEGOGO:Since we have successfully proven our concept through multiple test trials we need help from IndieGoGo to create our final ""Injection mold"" design, and really bring our product to life with our own original style! Our Industrial Team has designed a Headset design that is truly unique! Not only do we have Technology Advancements, but a beautiful look as well!**MEHGAN JAMES: BAD GIRL COLLECTION PACKAGE - $250**
THE STORY (December 2012)We started this idea as college students and teamed up with the Prairie View A&M School of Engineering program to create our concept. We first started off with some brief sketches and ideas of how we envisioned the Smart Listening Device looking. LET THE TEST TRIALS BEGIN! - Now that we sketched a few ideas, it was time to put the concept to test and see if the technology really worked! First we sourced a mini Android media player from our oversea connections and completely dissected it. It already came installed with the new Android 4.0 system, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, GPS, Mobile capabilities, and the ability to download mobile apps via Google Play! Then we sourced a fashionable ""Premium"" wired headset (V-Moda Crossfade), cut the cables off, and integrated the Bluetooth Android Media player.PROTOTYPE #1 (August 2013):It took us weeks of experimental test & procedures, but we finally got the job done!!

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>As an avid reader who has a rather large collection of ebooks, I have often found it annoying to have to dig out a USB cable just to put a new book on my Kindle device. For over a year I searched for a good server-based solution that would enable me to send books to the Kindle, but came up empty. It was then that I decided to simply create my own. The Personal Ebook Library is a multi-functional database-driven website which allows the user to upload their book collection to their own server, complete with cover images and book details. By setting up an account on the website, the user can add any number of email addresses (kindle device, normal email, even other devices that have the ability to receive mail.) WIth a click of a button the book can be sent directly to the device, email account, or downloaded to the computer.</p>
<p>At the moment PEL version 1 is minimalistic but functional. The new version will be much better (read: not ugly, more secure, and worthy of public release), have many added features, with the end goal to make the software available for others who wish to have their own all-in-one ebook library.</p>
<p>This is where you, dear contributors, come in. In order to have the time to complete PEL 2.0, I must lighten my workload, which means I lose income. I must also pay for caffeine (what good is a coder without caffeine?) and normal daily expenses. The contributions will be used to support my small team so that we can spend the time developing the software and getting it ready for release.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></h3>

<div>
<p>As previously stated, the funding will provide basic income for the coders while PEL 2.0 is in development. We don't live in mansions, and we don't drive gas-guzzling fancy schmancy cars, so our needs are minimal.</p>
<p>Contributors to this project will be entitled to a variety of perks, of course. Everything from progress reports via email, to a personalized copy upon release, with many perks in between. Of course, our eternal gratitude and appreciated comes with all perks. </p>

<h3><strong>THE GEEKY PART</strong></h3>
<p><b>Graphene</b></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Graphene
is amazing stuff. So thin that it would take 2 million sheets piled on top each
other to be the width of a penny coin. Yet each one of those sheets conducts electricity
better than copper. It was discovered by two Nobel Prize winning scientists at the university of Manchester in the UK about 10 years ago. Since then it has been talked about as a wonder material for all sorts of applications from touch screens that bend, new improved medical scanners, to ultra strong lightweight body armour. </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>We have used it to build an electrical
double layer capacitor (EDLC) or supercapacitor. Supercapacitors are a hybrid
between batteries and capacitors.</span></p>

<i>The ZAP&amp;GO loses only 20% of it's power in 72 hours (about the same rate as a lithium battery).</i><p><br/></p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: right;""><i>Supercapacitors
have been used for years in industrial applications, but they are large and heavy because they
incorporate two coils of aluminium foils inside separated by an insulating or
dielectric layer. We have replaced these foils with graphene foils. Graphene is much thinner than aluminium allowing us to increase the thickness of the dielectric layer. This means we can
increase the voltage output above the standard 2.7v, making our graphene supercapacitors much more efficient in consumer
electronic applications.</i></blockquote>

<h3><strong>THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN</strong></h3>
<p><b>Zapgocharger Ltd.</b></p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Zapgocharger
was originally called London Graphene. After receiving a UK Government grant, the company began to conduct market
research into advanced energy storage applications (including supercapacitors) and in early 2014, licensed patents from the Materials Science group at Oxford University in chemical vapor disposition (CVD) graphene. CVD produces
very high quality graphene, orders of magnitude more conductive than
copper, enabling Zapgocharger to develop supercapacitor
applications.</p>
<p><b>Stephen Voller</b><br/></p>
<p>This is not Stephen's first innovative new product. He invented the first CE marked portable hydrogen fuel cell system using an internal metal hydride canister which is now in the London Science Museum. The unique knowledge gained on this project helped him to develop the new power supply for the Zap&amp;Go charger.<br/></p>
<p><b>The design team</b><br/></p>
<p>Stephen has been working closely with a team of designers at a leading London-based consultancy to develop the ZAP&amp;GO charger and this campaign will fund further research and development into the technology, functionality and features of this innovative new product.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Next steps</strong></p>
<p>With two fully working prototypes, the second a quarter of the size of the first, we now need funding to complete our development and testing of both the supercapcitor and power supply. To further reduce the size we will replace the aluminium supercapacitors with a single graphene supercapacitor and further development of our quasi-constant power supply will enable us to manufacture a power supply small enough to fit inside the proposed ZAP&amp;GO design. Finally, testing will ensure compliance with all international standards before we can begin shipping in Autumn 2015.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Funding and risks</b></p>
<p>We are seeking a minimum of $30k to bring this important new technology to market. With this money we will make pre-production quantities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i><br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>We believe we have something unique, but the world is a big place and there is always the risk we don't. Also there is a risk we cannot get the product small and low-cost enough to be commercially viable. But what is life without risks? I believe in ZAP&amp;GO and with my knowledge and experience in innovative electronics and your financial support I plan to take this unique new product to market.</i></p>

<h3><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></h3>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>How does it charge so fast?</b><br/></p>
<p>If you have a mobile phone and a tablet you will notice that the tablets’ adaptor is larger than the one for your phone. This is because the phone uses 1A and the tablet 2.1A. If you have a laptop it will probably have a ‘brick’ charger, which is a transformer operating about 6A. To provide enough charge to charge a phone like the iPhone5 requires about 1.5Ah (1,500mAh - milli Amp hours). Using your 1A phone adaptor through a standard USB port is like using a garden hose to fill a large bucket of water, it takes time (for the iPhone 5 about 2.4 hours). The Zap&amp;Go does this in 5 minutes; like filling the same bucket from a fire hose. Very fast. But to do this we need a 40A power supply. This is the innovation inside the Zap&amp;Go.</p>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Will this damage my phone battery?</b><br/></p>
<p>Although the ZAP&amp;GO charges in just 5 minutes, it recharges your phone/tablet at the same rate your device would charge if plugged directly into the plug with your normal charge cable. There is no risk of damaging your lithium battery through charging too fast or over charging when using the ZAP&amp;GO.</p>
<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Doesn't this product already exist?</b><br/></p>
<p>There are chargers out there that claim they can do it in 15 minutes or less
(we have even see one claiming 30 seconds). The graphene supercapacitor can in-fact be charged in seconds. But to
charge it in 30 seconds would require a massive 400A power supply. This is why we are wary of those fast charge
battery claims, most require a large power supply to use them. <br/></p>

We have all been there... 



Plug ZAP&GO in for just 5 minutes...
...and re-charge any type of phone, tablet, eBook or headphones on the go. Save upto $200 by supporting our campaign today. See
our Black Friday special deal.RewardsTHE PROBLEMExisting charger products charge slowlyWhile people have evolved strategies to keep their phone charged, this is often stressful and time consuming. Powerbanks and external batteries are lithium-based like your phone and take at least as long to charge, which renders them useless if you don't plan ahead.My iPhone 5s takes 2.4 hrs to recharge. If I use an external charger with a bigger battery (say 3,000mAh) this takes a further 3 hrs to recharge. This is OK when I'm in the office, but no good at all when I am travelling.Stephen     THE SOLUTION
Supercapacitors charge quickly
By contrast supercapacitors charge very fast. In fact they can take in enough energy to fully recharge an iPhone in minutes. So my idea was to use a supercapacitor instead of a battery to recharge a phone.So why hasn't this been done before?Existing supercapacitors are made from double wound aluminium foils, and a supercapacitor sufficient to fully recharge an iPhone battery would be the size of a soda can and weigh about 0.5kg (1lb). This is far too big and heavy to package into a phone charger.The secret: graphene
We are replacing the aluminium, with a new advanced carbon material called graphene. The graphene is orders of magnitude more conductive than aluminium and so the foils inside the capacitor can be made thinner and lighter. This means that our new graphene supercapacitors are now small, light and low-cost enough to be made into a competitively priced phone charger. 
Also we had to develop a new type of power supply because to get enough power into the charger in a few minutes wouldn't work with existing power supplies.

 
The Zap&Go charger
THE SPECS

 Designed to charge any type of phone or tablet that has a standard
5v USB (Universal Serial Bus) port (including Apple, Amazon Kindle, HP, HTC, LG, Microsoft, Nokia,
Samsung, Sony)

Available with all international power plugs
Takes 1,500mAh of charge into its graphene supercapacitor in just 5 minutes: enough to charge an iPhone 5 from flat to 100% or a Samsung Galaxy 5 to 75%
THE STEPS1. Plug ZAP&GO in for just 5 minutes2. Plug your phone into ZAP&GO whilst it's charging if your battery is critically low. (ZAP&GO will continue to charge)3. When Zap&Go is fully charged you will hear a confirmation sound.4. Run for you flight or train and you phone will continue to charge as if it was still plugged into the wall.


THE STATS





THE GEEKY PART
Graphene
Graphene
is amazing stuff. So thin that it would take 2 million sheets piled on top each
other to be the width of a penny coin. Yet each one of those sheets conducts electricity
better than copper. It was discovered by two Nobel Prize winning scientists at the university of Manchester in the UK about 10 years ago. Since then it has been talked about as a wonder material for all sorts of applications from touch screens that bend, new improved medical scanners, to ultra strong lightweight body armour. We have used it to build an electrical
double layer capacitor (EDLC) or supercapacitor. Supercapacitors are a hybrid
between batteries and capacitors.

Batteries vs. CapacitorsBATTERIES (e.g. lithium phone batteries)


charge slowly (requiring a chemical reaction to take place)
vulnerable to being over-charged
discharge slowly



CAPACITORS


charge quickly (some in only a fraction of a second) as no chemical reaction takes place.
discharge quickly


If you replaced your mobile phone battery with a capacitor, the phone would charge up in say 30 seconds, but you would only have a few minutes of use before the capacitor lost its charge.

SUPERCAPACITORS


charge quickly
no risk of overcharging

discharge slowly 


The ZAP&GO loses only 20% of it's power in 72 hours (about the same rate as a lithium battery).
Supercapacitors
have been used for years in industrial applications, but they are large and heavy because they
incorporate two coils of aluminium foils inside separated by an insulating or
dielectric layer. We have replaced these foils with graphene foils. Graphene is much thinner than aluminium allowing us to increase the thickness of the dielectric layer. This means we can
increase the voltage output above the standard 2.7v, making our graphene supercapacitors much more efficient in consumer
electronic applications.
Stephen     




THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Zapgocharger Ltd.
Founded in 2013, Zapgocharger
was originally called London Graphene. After receiving a UK Government grant, the company began to conduct market
research into advanced energy storage applications (including supercapacitors) and in early 2014, licensed patents from the Materials Science group at Oxford University in chemical vapor disposition (CVD) graphene. CVD produces
very high quality graphene, orders of magnitude more conductive than
copper, enabling Zapgocharger to develop supercapacitor
applications.
Stephen Voller
This is not Stephen's first innovative new product. He invented the first CE marked portable hydrogen fuel cell system using an internal metal hydride canister which is now in the London Science Museum. The unique knowledge gained on this project helped him to develop the new power supply for the Zap&Go charger.
The design team
Stephen has been working closely with a team of designers at a leading London-based consultancy to develop the ZAP&GO charger and this campaign will fund further research and development into the technology, functionality and features of this innovative new product.

Next steps
With two fully working prototypes, the second a quarter of the size of the first, we now need funding to complete our development and testing of both the supercapcitor and power supply. To further reduce the size we will replace the aluminium supercapacitors with a single graphene supercapacitor and further development of our quasi-constant power supply will enable us to manufacture a power supply small enough to fit inside the proposed ZAP&GO design. Finally, testing will ensure compliance with all international standards before we can begin shipping in Autumn 2015.




Funding and risks
We are seeking a minimum of $30k to bring this important new technology to market. With this money we will make pre-production quantities.

We believe we have something unique, but the world is a big place and there is always the risk we don't. Also there is a risk we cannot get the product small and low-cost enough to be commercially viable. But what is life without risks? I believe in ZAP&GO and with my knowledge and experience in innovative electronics and your financial support I plan to take this unique new product to market.

Stephen

Risks & Challenges
The only risk we can see is that the production is going to be delayed. Nothing indicates this at the moment because everything is prepared and many pre-production samples have been made, and also the final molds for the casings are completed. We have tested the material for a long time with repeated testing to ensure the quality of both product and performance.

<p>Welcome to<strong> Flash Flood DIY waterproofing kit for your Phones &amp; Tablets </strong>using the latest military grade nanotechnology repellent.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nanostate.co/proj/logo-bot.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>45% of the worlds mobile phones &amp; tablets that get damaged are damaged by water, usually by people spilling drinks on the table and moisture e.g. bathroom, wet bag, wet pockets and puddles drops etc... Flash Flood stops this problem as it protects your phone or tablet using the latest Nano repellent coating used by the military that can be used on telecommunication devices without effecting the electronics, performance or the natural colour of your device as the coating is invisible.</span></p>

<h1><strong>So what made you think of this idea ?</strong></h1>
<p>I had been working in the natural stone business for over 15 years and coatings for protecting stone floors is part of the job so I had a fairly good knowledge of coatings.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>The accident !  </em></strong> </strong>About 3 years ago I was in a meeting when I screwed my phone up by spilling coffee on it, it caused me so many problems… I killed my phone, lost all my contacts, photo's and videos of my daughter, I was absolutely gutted. My phone and all those memories gone for good, the contacts being lost I could deal with.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>No Solutions ?</em></strong>   </strong>I thought there must be some type of coating to prevent this from happening again, just to protect you from day to day accidents like this, a quick search from the internet produced nothing only than big chunky ugly cases or plastic bags which all looked hideous. </p>
<p><strong><strong><em>By Chance !</em></strong>   </strong>It wasn't until February this year speaking to one of my old suppliers to see if he had any work available that he suggested that I contact a Nanotechnology coating manufacturer to buy and sell Nano coatings for existing flooring, I should use my existing contacts to sell it to, as people were looking of ways to preserve there floors and not replace them with new ones in these hard times.</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>At last ! </em></strong>  </strong>After contacting the manufacture there was one particular product that caught my eye and that was listed as ""military grade telecommunications coating"" which was similar to what I tried to find 3 years ago. I checked the market for a few days solid to find a DIY solution but still nothing existed 3 years on, there were some solutions but you had to send your phone away and it goes in to a chamber machine, took a few weeks to be done and it was as expensive as the phone itself, who needs that head ache or big expenses? Or buy the new waterproof Sony Xperia at $600... No thanks I already have a phone !</p>
<p><strong><strong><em>Your Help !</em></strong>   </strong>So here I am trying to give this new business a go it's been a hard few years without any work and I want to build a new future with a great product that really works, it's no where else, exclusive here only !<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nanostate.co/proj/edgirl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<p>We all have phones or tablets none of us can predict when any of the above is going to happen and more, there is nothing worse than <strong>""</strong> <strong>omg my phone wont switch on ! "" </strong>I've been there and done it and I am sure lots of you reading this have too, I know how it feels. <br/><br/>For a few $ you can save yourself a fortune in case of an accident and piece of mind. Our smallest package 1 x 50ml (US 1.7 fl oz) of Flash Flood which will nanocoat around 25 phones or 15 tablets, you can do the whole family which means the cost is peanuts and the piece of mind is great too ! <br/><br/><strong>Don't think I will be ok for now, if it happens you won't !</strong></p>

<h1><em>How does Nanotechnology work ?</em></h1>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nanostate.co/proj/wenzel.png"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<p><em>Ok ! in simple terms... There are hundreds of different types but all nanotechnology deals with dimensions and tolerances of less than 100 nanometers (40,000 times smaller than the width of an average human hair) Flash Flood Nanotechnology highly resists a wide variety of liquids based on the action of the "" Lotus Leaf "". Flash Flood is not not a physical barrier like normal waterproofing so it is 'breathable' which means it does not mist up, the ""nano repellent"" stops damage to telecommunication devices from liquids, moisture and humid atmospheres.</em></p>

<h1><em>How do I apply it to my phone or tablet ?</em></h1>
<p>It's a very simple process this is the full length video, the intro video was speeded up. This is important to watch if you are going to back this project.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhs9N0FNil4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhs9N0FNil4</a></p>

<h1><em>My phone or tablet has a plastic protector on the screen, will it still work ?</em></h1>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://nanostate.co/proj/iphone5_crystal540.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Yes it will ! Just coat the surface the same as the above video demo there is nothing different to do, don't forget if you change your screen protector for a new one you will need to recoat it again.</p>
<h1><strong>More Q &amp; A</strong></h1>
<div><em><strong>How long will the coating last for ?</strong></em></div>
<div><em><br/>Everyones usage on phones &amp; tablets are different, it should last up to 12 months. Every month or so drop a tiny water drop on the LCD and tip it off, if the water starts streaking then it's time for a new coat and repeat the whole coating process again.</em></div>
<div>
<p><strong><em>How long does it take to dry ?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>it drys within 6 hours, there will always be wet residue on your device after the 6 hours and this is normal with Flash Floods coating system. Just buff </em><em> with a microfibre cloth</em><em> until totally dry and your done and fully protected. We suggest you do it over night when you don't need your phone or tablet.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Is the coating the same process for each phone or tablet ?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Yes the process is exactly the same in the demo video, the demo was using the samsung S3. The iPhone is exactly the same process you can remove the back cover if you want but it's not necessary, just fill in any gaps especially on the rim. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>What will Flash Flood protect my phone or tablet from ?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Most everyday liquids and moisture : water, soda, alcohol, tea, coffee, oil and many more.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>I do a lot of sports &amp; activities will my phone or tablet be protected ?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Flash Flood does not make your phone or tablet any stronger, it's just a protective barrier against liquids and moisture which in some sports will be very useful, for example If you do cycling your can put your phone in your phone clamp with no case or protection in open air and the phone will be protected in bad weather. There are many sports or activities it can be used for you just have to think if your sport or activity requires your phone or tablet to be protected, it</em><strong> cannot be used</strong><em> for things like scuba diving where your device would be submerged, Flash Flood is there to protect you from day to day liquid hazards and any moisture as used by the military in telecommunication devices. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Is Flash Flood toxic ?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>No Flash Flood is not toxic and can be used safely inside the home, just use rubber gloves or surgical gloves as it can be an irritant on the skin in large volumes. All the safety information will be labeled according to EU safety standard requirements as by law.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How good is the quality of Flash Flood ?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>It's the highest quality Nano coating on the market, I have tested 2 other samples which had no where near the standard of the military grade Nano coatings, the military grade is 8 times more expensive but as you can see in the videos it's of superior quality.

Waterproof DIY Kit for your phone & tablet using the latest invisible Nanotechnology coating.


Welcome to Flash Flood DIY waterproofing kit for your Phones & Tablets using the latest military grade nanotechnology repellent.

45% of the worlds mobile phones & tablets that get damaged are damaged by water, usually by people spilling drinks on the table and moisture e.g. bathroom, wet bag, wet pockets and puddles drops etc... Flash Flood stops this problem as it protects your phone or tablet using the latest Nano repellent coating used by the military that can be used on telecommunication devices without effecting the electronics, performance or the natural colour of your device as the coating is invisible.
 

 
So what made you think of this idea ?
I had been working in the natural stone business for over 15 years and coatings for protecting stone floors is part of the job so I had a fairly good knowledge of coatings.
The accident !   About 3 years ago I was in a meeting when I screwed my phone up by spilling coffee on it, it caused me so many problems… I killed my phone, lost all my contacts, photo's and videos of my daughter, I was absolutely gutted. My phone and all those memories gone for good, the contacts being lost I could deal with.
No Solutions ?   I thought there must be some type of coating to prevent this from happening again, just to protect you from day to day accidents like this, a quick search from the internet produced nothing only than big chunky ugly cases or plastic bags which all looked hideous. 
By Chance !   It wasn't until February this year speaking to one of my old suppliers to see if he had any work available that he suggested that I contact a Nanotechnology coating manufacturer to buy and sell Nano coatings for existing flooring, I should use my existing contacts to sell it to, as people were looking of ways to preserve there floors and not replace them with new ones in these hard times.
At last !   After contacting the manufacture there was one particular product that caught my eye and that was listed as ""military grade telecommunications coating"" which was similar to what I tried to find 3 years ago. I checked the market for a few days solid to find a DIY solution but still nothing existed 3 years on, there were some solutions but you had to send your phone away and it goes in to a chamber machine, took a few weeks to be done and it was as expensive as the phone itself, who needs that head ache or big expenses? Or buy the new waterproof Sony Xperia at $600... No thanks I already have a phone !
Your Help !   So here I am trying to give this new business a go it's been a hard few years without any work and I want to build a new future with a great product that really works, it's no where else, exclusive here only !

 
We all have phones or tablets none of us can predict when any of the above is going to happen and more, there is nothing worse than "" omg my phone wont switch on ! "" I've been there and done it and I am sure lots of you reading this have too, I know how it feels. For a few $ you can save yourself a fortune in case of an accident and piece of mind. Our smallest package 1 x 50ml (US 1.7 fl oz) of Flash Flood which will nanocoat around 25 phones or 15 tablets, you can do the whole family which means the cost is peanuts and the piece of mind is great too ! Don't think I will be ok for now, if it happens you won't !
 
 
How does Nanotechnology work ?

Ok ! in simple terms... There are hundreds of different types but all nanotechnology deals with dimensions and tolerances of less than 100 nanometers (40,000 times smaller than the width of an average human hair) Flash Flood Nanotechnology highly resists a wide variety of liquids based on the action of the "" Lotus Leaf "". Flash Flood is not not a physical barrier like normal waterproofing so it is 'breathable' which means it does not mist up, the ""nano repellent"" stops damage to telecommunication devices from liquids, moisture and humid atmospheres.
 
Flash Floods Lotus Leaf Effect Demo


Please see the video on youtube
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiexliZCL0k
 
How do I apply it to my phone or tablet ?
It's a very simple process this is the full length video, the intro video was speeded up. This is important to watch if you are going to back this project.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhs9N0FNil4
 

My phone or tablet has a plastic protector on the screen, will it still work ?
 

 
Yes it will ! Just coat the surface the same as the above video demo there is nothing different to do, don't forget if you change your screen protector for a new one you will need to recoat it again.
More Q & A
How long will the coating last for ?
Everyones usage on phones & tablets are different, it should last up to 12 months. Every month or so drop a tiny water drop on the LCD and tip it off, if the water starts streaking then it's time for a new coat and repeat the whole coating process again.

How long does it take to dry ?
it drys within 6 hours, there will always be wet residue on your device after the 6 hours and this is normal with Flash Floods coating system. Just buff  with a microfibre cloth until totally dry and your done and fully protected. We suggest you do it over night when you don't need your phone or tablet.
Is the coating the same process for each phone or tablet ?
Yes the process is exactly the same in the demo video, the demo was using the samsung S3. The iPhone is exactly the same process you can remove the back cover if you want but it's not necessary, just fill in any gaps especially on the rim. 
What will Flash Flood protect my phone or tablet from ?
Most everyday liquids and moisture : water, soda, alcohol, tea, coffee, oil and many more.
I do a lot of sports & activities will my phone or tablet be protected ?
Flash Flood does not make your phone or tablet any stronger, it's just a protective barrier against liquids and moisture which in some sports will be very useful, for example If you do cycling your can put your phone in your phone clamp with no case or protection in open air and the phone will be protected in bad weather. There are many sports or activities it can be used for you just have to think if your sport or activity requires your phone or tablet to be protected, it cannot be used for things like scuba diving where your device would be submerged, Flash Flood is there to protect you from day to day liquid hazards and any moisture as used by the military in telecommunication devices. 
Is Flash Flood toxic ?
No Flash Flood is not toxic and can be used safely inside the home, just use rubber gloves or surgical gloves as it can be an irritant on the skin in large volumes. All the safety information will be labeled according to EU safety standard requirements as by law.
How good is the quality of Flash Flood ?
It's the highest quality Nano coating on the market, I have tested 2 other samples which had no where near the standard of the military grade Nano coatings, the military grade is 8 times more expensive but as you can see in the videos it's of superior quality. The manufacturer I am working with supplies military and commercial applications.
Is there a smaller size bottle ?
Unfortunately not, the minimum size has to be 50 ml  / US 1.7 fl oz to make the project viable and I also have to pay extra for bottling as it's sold as standard in steel drums to the military or commercial use, it's extremely expensive but extremely high quality !

<h3>Why Do We Need 1985?</h3>
<p>June 10th, 2013 - Over the last week, the country (and the world) have been rocked by the government's admission, after a wistleblower leak, that they have been monitoring the phone call data of every American in the country for many years.  President Obama has <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2337228/They-watch-ideas-form-type--Leaked-secret-documents-reveal-U-S-intelligence-agencies-tapping-directly-servers-Apple-Google-Facebook-spy-users.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> that we can't have ""100% privacy"" anymore.  U.S. Sen.

<p>1985 is a protocol and, with your help, a mobile application that will prevent government spying through the use of relays and encryption.  It will operate peer-to-peer, meaning it can't be shut down, it will be free for calls between 1985 users (and cheap for calls to landlines or mobile non-users), and it will be statistically impossible to know who is on both ends of the call.</p>

<h3>What Does The Money Go To?</h3>
<p>We need money for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>To fund a small development team to write the software</li>
<li>To fund the infrastructure to route calls to landlines and mobile non-users</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please continue to fund beyond the funding goal.  </strong>Two reasons: #1, if you fund at the $25 level, you'll get the first year of landline/mobile non-user service for cheaper than it will normally cost.  #2, If funds beyond our funding goal are received, we will be able to do things like offer free or cheaper subscriptions for landline/mobile non-user calling, produce the app for other platforms (BlackBerry, Windows Phone, and ordinary desktop/laptop computers), <em>etc.</em>, so please continue to donate even as we surpass our goal.  Your donation will not be wasted.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope to put an end to <em>en mass</em> spying on the communications of citizens.  The entire country need not use this software to achieve this goal: even if only a few percent of people do, spying on the rest of the citizens no longer accomplishes anything, because one would have to assume that anyone placing a call ""worth spying on"" would be among the few percent using 1985.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>MyEvidence is a safety and security mobile application designed to transmit live audio and video (audio/video) of potentially unsafe situations to a secured server accessible only to the user and other authorized individuals. At the time of transmission, it also provides a GPS position map indicating where the live transmission began. Once the transmission has begun the app is locked so only the user may stop the transmission allowing for audio/video evidence of what occurred. MyEvidence is activated by a simple touch of the app, a hot button, or is voice activated.</p>
<p><strong>Why MyEvidence? </strong></p>
<p>MyEvidence was developed in response to the numerous recent highly publicized news stories regarding harm to vulnerable individuals (for example; bullying, shooting of innocent teens, domestic violence, victims of the date rape drug, and sexual harassment cases, to name a few).</p>
<p>MyEvidence was created to provide peace of mind to loved ones who are not able to be with their vulnerable family members at all times. In unfortunate cases where a crime has occurred, this app can provide law enforcement officers, parents, or a family member valuable evidence of what has also occurred.</p>
<p>MyEvidence serves as a protector and deterrent. For example imagine a school aged child with a smart phone walking home from school. A van pulls up; the child recognizes this may be an unsafe situation and alerts the predator that live video and audio has begun. The predator then flees. This app has the potential to protect individuals and save lives in many situations just like this. Will you help support our efforts to save lives by pledging?</p>
<p><strong>Where We Stand</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to release MyEvidence by August 1st for both the IPhone and Android market for approval. Currently, the app is in the initial phase of development. With your help we can complete development and move into the testing phase of MyEvidence by July 2nd. We plan to do extensive testing of this app before August 1st. Please stay tuned for updates</p>
<p><strong>What we need from you</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have established the goal of the minimal amount needed so</strong><strong> <em>PLEASE</em> continue to pledge above and beyond the goal. </strong>Any amount above and beyond will go to Phase II of the app which we will communicate to all that pledge. We will also use the additional dollars pledged to get the app in the hands of all school aged children and vulnerable adults who carry a smart phone. We also want to connect with schools to minimize or even eliminate bullying. Our vision is to empower anyone that may find themselves in an unsafe situation and ultimately reduce the number of vulnerable children and adults. <strong>Any amount above our minimal goal will help us have a greater impact in stopping predators and saving lives.</strong></p>

Sadly today kids are spending most of their time indoors, mostly in school and day care centers. One of the main reasons is that they have very few friends around where they live. Even their parents are disconnected from the communities in which they live. Because they hardly know other parents just like them in their neighborhood, they are dependent on numerous different meet up websites and apps to arrange playdates for their children. This process can be extremely frustrating and time consuming . Despite all the planning, the playdates happens mostly on the weekends with people whom you hardly know !</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, today's’ kids spend only 4-7 minutes playing outdoors on a daily basis. The result being, doctors are treating more and more children for obesity, attention disorders, and depression. In fact every fifth child in the US is obese.</p>
<p>Kidzloop aims to change this forever.</p>
<h1>How?</h1>
<p>Using our location based app, Parents can now find and meet with other parents just like them in their neighborhood at nearby parks and playgrounds along with their children.</p>
<p>We aim to transform all the parks and playgrounds across the US into meeting places where children can spend more time playing with other children and parents can get involved in the real face to face social networking and get some fresh air.</p>
<p>We don’t stop there. We also help parents discover interesting kid centric news around their current interests which they would have otherwise missed out on. They can even keep themselves up to date with local kid friendly events and product recalls.</p>
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>We are extremely excited about this app. We sincerely believe that kidzloop will significantly help all the parents of younger children in a meaningful way on a daily basis. The app and the companion website will be free to use. To make this happen, we need support from awesome people like you.</p>
<p>We will use the funds primarily for the following purpose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase licensing agreements from key content providers for parenting news</li>

<div class=""ace-line gutter-author-p-29368 emptyGutter"" id=""magicdomid15""><span class=""fa-author-p-29368"">Existing gearboxes' ratios aren't always optimized for what teams use  them for, because of their max torque load. When these gearboxes strip and break, the internal gears are hard to replace, often  times requiring the replacement of the whole gearbox and motor, to save  time during the heat of competition. Mounting certain gearboxes prove  to be sometimes difficult because of the precision required to drill the  mounting holes.   </span></div>

<div class=""ace-line gutter-author-p-29368 emptyGutter"" id=""magicdomid17""><span class=""fa-author-p-29368"">We've created an alternative gearbox to solve all of  these problems. We offer 2 different gear ratios, optimized for high  torque uses. Instead of a planetary style gearbox, we've created a spur  gearbox to make gears easier to replace if they become stripped. To  solve the issue of mounting, we've created two slots. This means that if  the holes that are drilled slightly off, they'll still hold the gearbox  in place.   </span></div>

We are a group of high school students building the best gearboxes in the world for FIRST robotics.  This is a hard project, and our first step is to get our first-generation gearboxes into the hands of early-adopter FIRST teams.  In exchange for us supplying you an awesome gearbox at cost, we expect you to put it through real-world testing and give us the feedback we will need to build the next iteration of our product.  We want to build a tribe of people obsessed with helping us make the best FRC gearboxes in the world.
 
Oh yeah, the prototypes you see here were built out of ABS plastic.  The final versions that you receive will be made of steel and aluminum.  Unless you choose one of our pretty plastic options.

 
 
Who are we?

We are a group of students from the 7 year FIRST Robotics Team, the ausTIN CANs.   We've built many robots for competitions, and used almost every  available gearbox.  We believe that all current gearboxes have  shortcomings.  With Switchbox, we've tried to build our ideal gearbox  for rigorous world of robotics competitions.

 

A note to our backers from Kickstarter:
We  originally ran a Kickstarter for Switchbox, and the results were great:  we were supported by 93 backers and raised over $3,700.  However, we  did not reach our (admittedly high) funding goal of $15,000.  We are  undaunted.  We still believe in our vision of making the best FRC gear  box in the world.  We are redoubling our efforts, and moving here to  Indiegogo with an updated project.  We have reduced our funding goal to  be more in-line with the market, and are very eager to supply our  awesome gearboxes and rewards to our almost 100 backers. We've also added two new rewards: vinyl stickers, and a 3D printed keychain gear.
 
If you were one of our Kickstarter backers, please join us here by supporting us at the same level!  Since our Kickstarter project was not funded, you will not be charged for your Kickstarter contribution.
 
Finally, we've switched from t-shirts to stickers as our secondary reward.  This will allow us to focus more energy on building gear boxes.  We apologize for any inconvenience, but promise that the stickers will be awesome.
 
What makes Switchbox so cool?



Easy to Mount.  The Switchbox can be mounted on the face or  edges.  We use slots instead of holes for mounting to allow sliding.   This helps in  aligning gears or tensioning chains or belts.






Super Torque--Can Use Multiple Motors.  The Switchbox can be powered by one or two 500 series motors, which are very common in FIRST robotics.  






Easy to Expand and Maintain.  The Switchbox is easily assembled  and customized to different gear ratios. If a gear becomes stripped,  maintenance is simple, and only one of the mounting plates need to be  removed, the motors do not need to be detached from the mounting  position. 






Durable.  We chose large, durable spur gears that can stand up to the abuse of competition.



 

What shortcomings did we see in existing gearboxes?
Existing gearboxes' ratios aren't always optimized for what teams use  them for, because of their max torque load. When these gearboxes strip and break, the internal gears are hard to replace, often  times requiring the replacement of the whole gearbox and motor, to save  time during the heat of competition. Mounting certain gearboxes prove  to be sometimes difficult because of the precision required to drill the  mounting holes.   
 
We've created an alternative gearbox to solve all of  these problems. We offer 2 different gear ratios, optimized for high  torque uses. Instead of a planetary style gearbox, we've created a spur  gearbox to make gears easier to replace if they become stripped. To  solve the issue of mounting, we've created two slots. This means that if  the holes that are drilled slightly off, they'll still hold the gearbox  in place.   
 
For a while we've wanted to have the ability  to use two fisher-price or other 500 series motors on the same gearbox  to get more torque, and that's exactly what we did. Our solution allows  you to mount one or two of these motors on the gearbox.   
  
What rewards are available?


Five dollars buys our our gratitude, and helps us along!




Visually stunning vinyl stickers that show you are part of the Switchbox tribe.
Tiny 3D printed plastic gear keychain!  See pics below.





Switchbox gearbox with one gear reduction (20:1).  This is the exact  same frame and first gear stage as the other Switchbox.  The only difference is that the final gear stage, axle and bearings are omitted  to save money.  This will be the real deal, made of steel and aluminum.  It will come with bearings and axles.  You supply your own motors.




Switchbox gearbox with two gear reductions (20:1 and 90:1).  This will be the real deal, made of steel and aluminum.  It will come with bearings and axles.  You supply your own motors.




Clear side plate!  See pics below.




The original orange plastic prototype gearbox! There is only one of these in the world!


 Please include
Keychain gear!
This small reward is a 3D printed plastic gear.  Makes a cool keychain!  The gear will also fit over pencils, so you can build your own tiny gear box.
 


 
 
Clear side plate!
A clear body plate for your Switchbox.  This makes the Switchbox suitable for desktop display or teaching about gears.  Note that the gearbox should not be used under load with this plastic side.
 

Stress Test
Previously, our stress test was an unlockable reward.  We are now committed to running the stress test for free.  We are committed to creating a durable gearbox that stands up to real-world  robot competitions.  We will conduct a stress test and publish the  results online.  We will examine the effects of real-world torque and speed over time.  At a minimum, we will run the gearbox under load for one week or until failure.  Note that our exact experimental set up is yet to be  determined.
 
 

What's the money for?
Our plan is to spend all of the money on the parts to build our gearboxes.  Any money left over will go toward our stress testing and future prototypes.
 
What are the specifications?


Dimensions: L: 7.5"" W: 1.5"" H: 4.2"" 




Motor types: 500 series- Banebots, Andymark, Fisher Price




Motor pinions: 12 tooth 32dp




Mounting options: slots on either end of the top/bottom




Mounting hole diameter: 1""x1/4"" slot




Gear reductions: 20:1, 90:1.  Note: these gear reductions have been  updated since our original prototype.  See FAQ below for details.




Shaft types: 3/8"" hex shaft with machine rounded ends




Shaft diameters: Idler shaft 1 1/2"", Output shaft 3""




Max output torque: 11.25 N*m, 56 N*m


 
Please note that these specs may change slightly as we iterate toward better design.  We will post news about any  specification updates.
 

Timeline
First of all, for FRC teams who will be using these gearboxes in the 2013 season, we will have them express manufactured and shipped to you by January 24 2012 for use this season.  If you would like this option, please email us.
 
For all other orders, we will ship March 15, 2013.
 
CAD Files:
We will make the CAD files of the finished product publicly available.  This will help teams to include them in future designs, and  will make it easier to modify and repair the gearbox.
 
How its made:
We will be purchasing most of the gears and bearings from West Coast  Products. We plan to get the plates of the gear box cut from a water jet  cutter at a local business then have them bent using a break.  Our plan  is to make the shafts in house in our shop. Then once we have all the  individual pieces we will assemble the gearbox in house",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is the difference between Faveeo and a Search Engine</h3>
<p>First, it will <strong>push new quality content to you as soon as it appears</strong>, so you don't have to search over and over again for your favourite topics, <strong>Faveeo searches and discovers content for you.</strong></p>
<p>Second, <strong>users can only search about concepts and topics they actually know</strong>. This might seem obvious, but for researchers, students and people looking to learn the details about something, it's challenging and especially time consuming to find the proper keywords to use.</p>
<p>Of couse, we know there are some great tools out there already helping to circumvent these issues, either leveraging social media, or by enabling ""alerts"" but <strong>our mission with Faveeo is to simplify the process of advanced information discovery</strong>, by offering you an all in one advanced platform that is powerful, reliable and really simple to use at the same time.</p>
<p>Today, with Faveeo, we are offering to democratize these tools, and make them available to everyone!</p>
<h3>What is different between Faveeo and other discovery tools?</h3>
<p>1) <strong>Discovery of new sources and networks: </strong>By teaching Faveeo about the kind of sources and you are looking for, our system can figure out those who are likely to be trusted sources of information.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Learning about your different profiles</strong>: By using advanced text extraction methods, we go further than most recommendation systems by identifyng the tone, the lenght and other signals that can indicate your preferences about a specific topic, using more than simply the keywords in that text.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Social recommendations:</strong> …By detecting users that seem to click, like, share or save the same articles, we can connect them together to mutualize their search and discovery operations, in order to speed discovery and recommendations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Some example searches</h2>
<p>To have an idea on how Faveeo can help build advanced searches really easily, here are some examples of ""related keywords"" propositions using our prototype tool.</p>
<h3>
<a name=""climate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Climate change  <em>(Click to enlarge)</em>
</h3>

<p><em>An example of a search about ""Climate change"" using Faveeo, gives a great overview of the related keywords and concepts that can be used to narrow down or broaden your search</em><em>.</em></p>

<p><em>Another example, this time about our favourite CMS : Drupal! The results are indeed quite relevant and allow you to see the related projects and technologies around Drupal!</em></p>
<h3>Key Benefits of our tool</h3>
<p><strong>Speed up information sharing</strong> by automatically connecting like minded users, even if they are not ""formally"" connected by their current social networks.</p>
<p><strong>Construct advanced queries</strong> thanks to our visual search engine that will help identify related concepts and trends you might have missed otherwise;</p>
<p><strong>Discover relevant information quickly</strong> thanks to our recommendation engine that will filter and adapt itself according to your ongoing feedback.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>We need to raise 75000$ to cover the cost of <strong>finalization of our product</strong>, making sure it works for any topic out there, making sure the architecture is solid, <strong>fast and reliable</strong> and that we can build the <strong>best recommendation engine around.</strong></p>
<p>We will also use these funds to <strong>build mobile applications</strong> for Android, iPhone and Windows, as well as enabling the usage of our product in<strong> spanish, french and german</strong> as well as english and, finally, integrate new media types to our recommendations, especially <strong>images and video</strong>!</p>
<p>That's quite a lot to do, but we are already moving fast and<strong> the 5 of us are  committed</strong> to make this possible in the next few months!</p>
<h3>What do you get for contributing?</h3>
<p>For your contributions, we're offering free access to faveeo for periods going for 3 months to 2 years! We are also offering, <strong>for only 150USD a free Faveeo subscription for life!</strong> We're also of course sending out some cool gifts, like cool faveeo stickers, and some surprise seeds you can then plant in your home or garden!</p>
<p>By contributing to our project, you will help us finish our prototype and release a proper public version of our already promising product! But more importantly, you'll be helping the launch of a smart filtering and discovery platform that for the first time is designed and aimed at regular internet users and not at large corporations!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>OK, fine. But who are you guys?</h3>
<p><strong>We are geeks, we love bigdata, semantics, machine-learning and statistics! Yeah! (And we love the web!)</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we are a great mix of skills. First we are two sociologists, Alexis Dufresne and Kian Rieben, that have an academic background in research.</p>
<p>The social sciences approach, gives us great insights on such topics as ""what is quality information"", ""what are the different quality signals users can send to a system"", ""how can we analyse and emerge hidden relations between users"", ""how can we detect trust and confidence from social signals"", and much much more really interesting questions.</p>
<p>The social sciences side is backed up by our CTO, Nicholas Wolff and lead engineer, Marc Escher an EPFL Software Engineer that has the skills to handle Big Data type calculations and systems, providing with the arsenal needed to tackle these large problems.</p>
<p>Finally, our last co-founder, Yves Maumary, an ex-CERN physicist amongst other great things, also brings his own experience helping us figuring out ways we can relate physics to network analysis. <strong>It's always nice to have someone that comes from where the web was born in our team.</strong></p>
<p>With this team of passionate and, let's admit it, hardcore geeks, we are confident we can deliver Faveeo and make it the most useful information discovery tool you've seen!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 class=""p1""> How does Faveeo work?</h3>
<p>Faveeo allows you to create advanced searches that we call ""magazines"". Each faveeo account as a definite number of magazines that can support really complex queries.</p>
<p>Once your query is ready and satisfying, then you can start consuming the content with our full page magazine interface, from which you can curate, share, save and vote on articles in order to teach the system how you want this specific magazine to behave.</p>
<p>See the following screenshots to have a good understanding on how the magazines work!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3> Start by creating a magazine</h3>
<p>Launch a new magazine by selecting some interesting keywords. You can already have a preview of the content that's returned by query.</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div>

<h3>Construct complex queries by using AND's and OR's with our visual tool</h3>
<p>Add some keywords in your ""Formula"" using our visual search interface. It's really easy to create complex queries including multiple groups of AND / OR to either broaden or narrow your search.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.faveeo.com/sites/default/files/geolocalize_0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3> Once happy with your query, you can start reading!</h3>
<p>The ""Full View"" magazine page, allows you to vote on articles, hide them, share them either on your social networking accounts (great for content curation!) or also within specific Faveeo Communities. Everything you do on this page teaches the recommendation engine how to adapt this specific magazine to your tastes!</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.faveeo.com/sites/default/files/mag.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.faveeo.com/sites/default/files/mag_0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></h3>
<h3>  </h3>
<h3>Manage your sources</h3>
<p>Each magazine allows to have an overview and a control of which sources are influencing your magazine's content. Using this tool a user can simply reorder and remove sources according to it's preferences.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://f.cl.ly/items/1v0c3E1P0X2c42341W0z/Screen%20shot%202012-11-28%20at%204.30.51%20PM.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are our motivations? (Why are we doing this?)</h3>
<p>The problem with the current social networks is that one still needs to ""follow"" or to ""friend"" quite a lot of people to start getting valuable content from the network. </p>
<p>This system is annoying and especially time consuming. <strong>It's also very limiting.</strong></p>
<p>How about a system who can connect you with interesting users automatically based on various criteria including common interests, network proximity, similarity?</p>
<p>How about a platform who could provide <strong>the right content, to the right people, at the right time</strong>, by being able to understand your specific needs, about specific topics?</p>
<p><strong>This is exactly what drives us.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How much Faveeo will cost when released? Why is it not free?</h3>
<p>When officially released to the public, <strong>Faveeo will cost 99USD / year</strong> for the basic package including 3 magazines. Each extra magazine will then cost 3USD / month so you can adapt your pricing depending on you needs. The billing will be on a monthly basis, with no contract attached.</p>
<p>We have decided to go this route to be able to not show any advertisement on the site, and of course to not have to sell our user's data to advertisers in order to monitize the site. We think this is an incredible value-added of our product, as <strong>your privacy data will not be sold to third-party thanks to our fair pricing policy!</strong> </p>
<p>Get your Faveeo subscription now during our Crowdfunding campaign to enjoy these great prices, especially the 150USD lifelong subscription!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>When can you expect your gift?</h3>
<p> The releases of the rewards are planned for mid-april, but hopefully it will be sooner! Everyone who gets the Faveeo ""Patron"" and ""Hero"" perks, we are aiming at a  early-VIP release early march.</p>
<h3>Thanks for looking at our page, and welcome to the Discovery Revolution!</h3>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>Quelles sont nos motivations ? </h2>
<p><strong>Internet peut être ennuyeux</strong> si vous ne savez pas où regarder. Le succès de sites comme Facebook, Twitter et Youtube montre que les utilisateurs préfèrent s’installer confortablement et attendre que le contenu vienne à eux. </p>
<p>Nous aimerions <strong>faciliter et surtout accélérer la découverte sur le web</strong>, afin de vous aider à élargir vos horizons et à découvrir de nouvelles sources de contenu.</p>
<h2>Pourquoi nous aider?</h2>
<p>Nous devons trouver 75.000 $ pour couvrir les frais de <strong>finalisation de notre produit</strong> afin de nous assurer qu’il fonctionne pour tous les sujets possibles, que son architecture soit <strong>solide, rapide et fiable</strong> et que nous pouvons créer le meilleur moteur de recommandations.</p>
<p>Nous utiliserons également ces fonds pour créer des applications mobiles pour <strong>Android, iPhone et Windows</strong> et nous permettrons l’utilisation de notre produit en espagnol, en français, en allemand ainsi qu’en anglais. Enfin, nous intégrerons de nouvelles formes de média à nos recommandations, en particulier des images et des vidéos !</p>
<p>Nous avons beaucoup de pain sur la planche mais nous avançons déjà rapidement et <strong>les 5 membres de notre équipe s’engagent</strong> à faire de ce projet une réalité dans les prochains mois !</p>
<p>En échange de vos dons, nous vous offrons un accès gratuit à Faveeo durant des périodes s’étalant de 3 mois à 2 ans ! Nous vous proposons également un <strong>abonnement à vie à Faveeo</strong> pour seulement 150 USD !</p>
<p>Bien entendu, nous envoyons aussi des petits cadeaux, comme des autocollants Faveeo sympas et des graines surprises que vous pourrez planter dans votre maison ou votre jardin !</p>
<p> Encore plus important, vous contribuerez au lancement d’une plateforme intelligente de filtrage et de découverte qui est, pour la première fois, conçue pour et destinée aux utilisateurs réguliers d’Internet et qui <strong>n'est pas réservée aux grandes entreprises!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ok, c'est super.. mais qui êtes vous, en fait?</h2>
<p>Tout d’abord, nous représentons une excellente combinaison de compétences grâce aux deux sociologues fondateurs, Alexis Dufresne et Kian Rieben,disposant d’une expérience universitaire en matière de recherche.</p>
<p>L’approche des sciences sociales nous donne de bons aperçus sur des sujets tels que « en quoi consiste une information de qualité », « quels sont les différents signaux de qualité que les utilisateurs peuvent envoyer à un système », « comment pouvons-nous analyser et faire ressortir les liens cachés entre des utilisateurs », «comment pouvons-nous détecter la fiabilité des signaux sociaux et la confiance à leur accorder » et bien d’autres questions très intéressantes! </p>
<p>Le rôle des sciences sociales est appuyé par notre Directeur technique et principal ingénieur, Nicholas Wolff, titulaire d'une maîtrise d'ingénieur logiciel gérer les calculs et les systèmes de données ""Big Data"" et doté de l’arsenal nécessaire pour s’attaquer à ces gros problèmes. Traîter un million de documents par jour? Pas de problème...</p>
<p>Nicholas est appuyé par Marc Escher, aussi ingénieur EPFL qui a une longue expérience en développement et en création d'entreprises. Ces deux développeurs créent une parfaite balance entre notre ADN sociologique et technique.</p>
<p>Enfin, notre dernier co-fondateur, Yves Maumary, un ex physicien du CERN, apporte également son expérience en nous aidant à découvrir des manières de relier la physique à l’analyse des réseaux de manière a bien injecter une bonne dose de science pure à toutes nos activités.</p>
<p>Forts de cette équipe composée, admettons-le, de geeks passionnés et irréductibles, nous sommes sûrs de pouvoir lancer Faveeo et d’en faire l’outil de découverte d’informations le plus utile possible!</p>
<h2>Comment utiliser  Faveeo?</h2>

Short Summary
Hello all and welcome to our indiegogo campaign! We are a great mix of two sociologists, two software engineers and a physicist based in Lausanne and Geneva, Switzerland, and are excited to introduce you to our fabulous project : Faveeo!
Faveeo is a next-generation content discovery tool, that changes the way we find information about our interests and passions!
Faveeo allows you to :
Follow your passions easily by creating a magazine for each of your favorite interests!
Use our visual keyword suggestion map to discover related concepts and trends around your passions!Monitor the whole web to filter and extract the best content for your favourite topics, so you don't have to make the same searches over and over again!
You can think of it as your own personal web and social networks assistant as it will help you find interesting content about your favourite topics, without you having to search over and over for the same keywords.
Have a look at a quick video presentation of the concept here!
Follow us on Twitter! 
 
Faveeo in Action
 

 

 
 
What is the difference between Faveeo and a Search Engine
First, it will push new quality content to you as soon as it appears, so you don't have to search over and over again for your favourite topics, Faveeo searches and discovers content for you.
Second, users can only search about concepts and topics they actually know. This might seem obvious, but for researchers, students and people looking to learn the details about something, it's challenging and especially time consuming to find the proper keywords to use.
Of couse, we know there are some great tools out there already helping to circumvent these issues, either leveraging social media, or by enabling ""alerts"" but our mission with Faveeo is to simplify the process of advanced information discovery, by offering you an all in one advanced platform that is powerful, reliable and really simple to use at the same time.
Today, with Faveeo, we are offering to democratize these tools, and make them available to everyone!
What is different between Faveeo and other discovery tools?
1) Discovery of new sources and networks: By teaching Faveeo about the kind of sources and you are looking for, our system can figure out those who are likely to be trusted sources of information.
2) Learning about your different profiles: By using advanced text extraction methods, we go further than most recommendation systems by identifyng the tone, the lenght and other signals that can indicate your preferences about a specific topic, using more than simply the keywords in that text.
3) Social recommendations: …By detecting users that seem to click, like, share or save the same articles, we can connect them together to mutualize their search and discovery operations, in order to speed discovery and recommendations.
 
Some example searches
To have an idea on how Faveeo can help build advanced searches really easily, here are some examples of ""related keywords"" propositions using our prototype tool.

Climate change  (Click to enlarge)


An example of a search about ""Climate change"" using Faveeo, gives a great overview of the related keywords and concepts that can be used to narrow down or broaden your search.

Drupal CMS (Click to enlarge)


Another example, this time about our favourite CMS : Drupal! The results are indeed quite relevant and allow you to see the related projects and technologies around Drupal!
Key Benefits of our tool
Speed up information sharing by automatically connecting like minded users, even if they are not ""formally"" connected by their current social networks.
Construct advanced queries thanks to our visual search engine that will help identify related concepts and trends you might have missed otherwise;
Discover relevant information quickly thanks to our recommendation engine that will filter and adapt itself according to your ongoing feedback.
 
How can you help?
We need to raise 75000$ to cover the cost of finalization of our product, making sure it works for any topic out there, making sure the architecture is solid, fast and reliable and that we can build the best recommendation engine around.
We will also use these funds to build mobile applications for Android, iPhone and Windows, as well as enabling the usage of our product in spanish, french and german as well as english and, finally, integrate new media types to our recommendations, especially images and video!
That's quite a lot to do, but we are already moving fast and the 5 of us are  committed to make this possible in the next few months!
What do you get for contributing?
For your contributions, we're offering free access to faveeo for periods going for 3 months to 2 years! We are also offering, for only 150USD a free Faveeo subscription for life! We're also of course sending out some cool gifts, like cool faveeo stickers, and some surprise seeds you can then plant in your home or garden!
By contributing to our project, you will help us finish our prototype and release a proper public version of our already promising product! But more importantly, you'll be helping the launch of a smart filtering and discovery platform that for the first time is designed and aimed at regular internet users and not at large corporations!
 
 
OK, fine. But who are you guys?
We are geeks, we love bigdata, semantics, machine-learning and statistics! Yeah! (And we love the web!)
First of all, we are a great mix of skills. First we are two sociologists, Alexis Dufresne and Kian Rieben, that have an academic background in research.
The social sciences approach, gives us great insights on such topics as ""what is quality information"", ""what are the different quality signals users can send to a system"", ""how can we analyse and emerge hidden relations between users"", ""how can we detect trust and confidence from social signals"", and much much more really interesting questions.
The social sciences side is backed up by our CTO, Nicholas Wolff and lead engineer, Marc Escher an EPFL Software Engineer that has the skills to handle Big Data type calculations and systems, providing with the arsenal needed to tackle these large problems.
Finally, our last co-founder, Yves Maumary, an ex-CERN physicist amongst other great things, also brings his own experience helping us figuring out ways we can relate physics to network analysis. It's always nice to have someone that comes from where the web was born in our team.
With this team of passionate and, let's admit it, hardcore geeks, we are confident we can deliver Faveeo and make it the most useful information discovery tool you've seen!
 
 How does Faveeo work?
Faveeo allows you to create advanced searches that we call ""magazines"". Each faveeo account as a definite number of magazines that can support really complex queries.
Once your query is ready and satisfying, then you can start consuming the content with our full page magazine interface, from which you can curate, share, save and vote on articles in order to teach the system how you want this specific magazine to behave.
See the following screenshots to have a good understanding on how the magazines work!
 
 Start by creating a magazine
Launch a new magazine by selecting some interesting keywords. You can already have a preview of the content that's returned by query.

 


Construct complex queries by using AND's and OR's with our visual tool
Add some keywords in your ""Formula"" using our visual search interface. It's really easy to create complex queries including multiple groups of AND / OR to either broaden or narrow your search.

 

 Once happy with your query, you can start reading!
The ""Full View"" magazine page, allows you to vote on articles, hide them, share them either on your social networking accounts (great for content curation!) or also within specific Faveeo Communities. Everything you do on this page teaches the recommendation engine how to adapt this specific magazine to your tastes!

  
Manage your sources
Each magazine allows to have an overview and a control of which sources are influencing your magazine's content. Using this tool a user can simply reorder and remove sources according to it's preferences.

 
What are our motivations? (Why are we doing this?)
The problem with the current social networks is that one still needs to ""follow"" or to ""friend"" quite a lot of people to start getting valuable content from the network. 
This system is annoying and especially time consuming. It's also very limiting.
How about a system who can connect you with interesting users automatically based on various criteria including common interests, network proximity, similarity?
How about a platform who could provide the right content, to the right people, at the right time, by being able to understand your specific needs, about specific topics?
This is exactly what drives us.
 
How much Faveeo will cost when released? Why is it not free?
When officially released to the public, Faveeo will cost 99USD / year for the basic package including 3 magazines. Each extra magazine will then cost 3USD / month so you can adapt your pricing depending on you needs. The billing will be on a monthly basis, with no contract attached.
We have decided to go this route to be able to not show any advertisement on the site, and of course to not have to sell our user's data to advertisers in order to monitize the site. We think this is an incredible value-added of our product, as your privacy data will not be sold to third-party thanks to our fair pricing policy! 
Get your Faveeo subscription now during our Crowdfunding campaign to enjoy these great prices, especially the 150USD lifelong subscription!
 
When can you expect your gift?
 The releases of the rewards are planned for mid-april, but hopefully it will be sooner! Everyone who gets the Faveeo ""Patron"" and ""Hero"" perks, we are aiming at a  early-VIP release early march.
Thanks for looking at our page, and welcome to the Discovery Revolution!

<p><strong>Will KUBI charge my tablet?<br/></strong>In order to maximize KUBI’s flexibility as a tablet stand, we have not included charging capabilities. However, KUBI is designed so that the charging port for most tablets is readily accessible during use, so you can charge your tablet with your original cord.</p>
<p><strong>Can KUBI work with my smartphone?<br/></strong>Yes! KUBI is compatible with any device that runs Bluetooth 4.0 and has the free KUBI app. We’ve designed a smartphone adaptor for KUBI so you can run it with your phone.

<p><strong>Will the app include motion tracking for “follow me”?<br/></strong>We’ve created stretch goals as appendices to our $100k production goal in this crowdfunding campaign. If together we can raise $200k, we can make motion tracking and “follow me” a reality for the first production release of KUBIs! </p>

Standard Copy Screen 


Premium Security

STANDARD COPY SCREEN  FEATURES
Have you ever needed to capture some information from your
computer screen, but were unable to copy because it’s either an image, a locked
PDF file or some text in a video? Today the only options at hand are:

Grab a piece of paper and write down
     what you need and retype it on your computer
Open a different window and try to copy
     every letter of a long text or link
This is too much work and it is prone to typos. At Easy+ we believe
in making things easier for all… and that´s how the Easy + idea came to be
!
Easy+ recognizes
all the letters within an image and then follows your orders and commands.
Easy+ opens the door for a revolutionary way of extracting text from
your screen... We call it “Universal Copy”.  With Easy+ you’ll be able
to:

Extract text
Open a link in an image
Translate text

Read QR Codes 

Anywhere on
your screen and all at once with just one click.PREMIUM SECURITY FEATURESQR CODESThe Premium Security version will include all the features of the Standard  plus incredible security applications.  We have developed a software that can encrypt your  notes, emails and texts using QR Codes. You can save your information encrypted in Qr codes that JUST YOU and the people you decide can read.The Premium security version allows you to:
Improve physical portability: You can convert your information in QR codes. One page with QR codes contains HUGE amount of information.




Link to your website or info: You can create QR codes that link you to your website, then just print it in your business cards

Encrypt and Compress Text: Encrypt your messages or documents, to keep them safe or share them just with the people you decide. 

See the following video for SECURITY PREMIUM information
TECHNOLOGY

Our software
is based on Optical Character Recognition, usually abbreviated OCR.  Easy+ will convert scanned or photographed images of typewritten or
printed text into a readable text. In other words, virtually anything you can
read on the screen Easy+ will be able to convert it to text.
Here are some
examples:

Imagine
you are traveling and you need to read a document or a sign in a different
language.  Just take a picture and Easy+ will translate it for you, so
you don’t need to copy word by word.





Just take a picture and Easy + will translate it for you, so you don’t need to copy word by word.






You’re working on your homework/thesis and you need to copy a paragraph of a blocked PDF. Copy word by word??… Not anymore!, Just select what you want to copy and Easy + will do the work for you.


You need to know more about any topic… just select it or take a picture of it and Easy + will open your browser to give you more information



You’re
watching a video on YouTube and there’s a link you would like to follow, just mark the link...
... and Easy+ will open the website for you



*Initially for Windows™ platformsFuture
applications:

Cloud explanation:  For Premium version you will be able to save everything you copy in the cloud.  All the info would be available for future searches.

Easy +
 can also  be connected to your phone, so if you’re working on your
computer and see a number you want to dial, just select it and Easy + will dial
it for you


You’re
walking down the street and you see an email or phone number you’d like to
contact.  






...Just take a picture and Easy + will write an email or dial the
number for you.



PROTOTYPE
We already have a prototype
to do all of the major
features, but we need your help to develop new features and improve the
existing ones.  Quality and reliability are our signature, that’s why we
need your support in order to make this dream come true.

Here is our prototype menu:



All of us want to have a simpler life, Easy+ and your
help will make it possible










OUR TEAM




ESTIMATED DEVELOPMENT
TIME
We need your help to
develop Easy+ and make life easy for all.  The more working capital we can
achieve, the more features we’re going to develop. 
Why do we need the start up capital? Mainly to obtain an Optical Character Recognition system(OCR)  that implements an image processing algorithm to increase the accuracy recognition of computer displayed fonts.  To do it, we need a software that improves the current prototype in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical, increase the script recognition, convert all images to black and white and more important enhance character isolation.
Another important part of the project refers to enhance processing and storage power to process large volume of documents simultaneously. The infrastructure needed to support all requirements is very costly. 
Finally, we want to make Easy+ cross-platform, in other words, make it compatible with Windows™, Android™ and iOS™.



Our functional
prototype guarantees
Easy+ is achievable and will become
a reality.  You´ll be the first to enjoy Easy+ at a price
significantly lower than future retail price.

<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">The micro suction foam face is pretty cool. Imagine a whole bunch of tiny little suction cups. That's what we have used to hold phones to the Air Dock. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Full size suction cups need a smooth glossy surface to stick to. Similarly the micro suction foam needs a smooth glossy phone to hold onto. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Any phone with a glossy back will stick great to the micro suction foam. If your phone isn't glossy on the back, then it's just a simple matter of putting it in a case that is smooth and glossy. </span></span></p>

<span style=""color: #0099ff;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: 36px;"">phones?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Not all phones have a glossy back, and not all people want their phones in a case. To help make more phones work on the Air Dock we have added strategically placed magnets just under the surface of the Air Dock. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Some phones(and tablets), including the Nexus 5, and the Nexus 7 have little metal discs embedded in the back plate of the phone. Our magnets line up with these metal discs, and pull quite nicely on them. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""color: #696969;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Many phones have metal in their backs (the Galaxy phones all have some metal), so the magnets only help to hold the phone better. (More on each compatible phone below)</span></span></p>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""color: #696969;"">So far in this journey we have gone through dozens of prototypes. Getting the right grip from the pad has been key. We discovered early that the back of the phone needs to be glossy for the phone to stick to the Air Dock. This means that if you have a phone that doesn't have a glossy back you will need to get a case that is glossy. This isn't a problem for most phones, as they are already glossy backed. </span></span></p>

The disadvantage to this option is that the replacement back cover is thicker than the original. This becomes a problem if you are trying to put your phone back into a hard case. If you don't use a case with your phone, this is a great option. This is also the highest quality receiver you can get. It is highly recommended. </span></span>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;""><span style=""color: #696969;"">Option 2 - Buy an aftermarket wireless charging kit. This kit gets applied right over the battery under the original back cover. This keeps the phone closer to the same thickness so that it will fit more easily into a hard case. We will be testing different brands of these and recommending/supplying the one we find works best. They are aftermarket and are not as high of quality as the Samsung brand back cover. (they are a little bit cheaper though)</span></span>

		 </p></div>","Thanks so much for your supportThe campaign is over, and we are very grateful for all the support we received. The new home for The Air Dock will be: TheAirDock.comThere you will be able to pre-order your Air Dock if you didn't get to during the campaign.What is the Air Dock?

		 

The Air dock is a wireless charging car dock for your smartphone. It holds your phone with no clips and no clamps 



		 

It wirelessly charges your phone without plugging the phone into anything.

		 



		 

 

		 

How does it work?

The face of the Air Dock is a micro suction foam that magically holds your phone in place. Inside the Air Dock are magnets that pull the phone tightly into the foam face.  



		 

The Qi wireless charger is built into the dock. Any phone that supports Qi charging will automatically charge once placed on the Air Dock

		 

		 

Will my phone work on the Air 

Dock?

There are many phones that will work on the Air Dock. We are working on testing more and more phones all the time. Right now we can recommend a handful of phones to be used on the Air Dock. (We know there are more, but haven't tested them yet)

iPhone 5/4


		 



		 

		 

Galaxy S4/3


		 



		 

Nexus 5/4


		 



		 

Galaxy Note 3/2


		 



		 

		 

How does this magical foam work?

The micro suction foam face is pretty cool. Imagine a whole bunch of tiny little suction cups. That's what we have used to hold phones to the Air Dock. 

Full size suction cups need a smooth glossy surface to stick to. Similarly the micro suction foam needs a smooth glossy phone to hold onto. 

Any phone with a glossy back will stick great to the micro suction foam. If your phone isn't glossy on the back, then it's just a simple matter of putting it in a case that is smooth and glossy. 

		 

Why use magnets to hold the 

phones?

Not all phones have a glossy back, and not all people want their phones in a case. To help make more phones work on the Air Dock we have added strategically placed magnets just under the surface of the Air Dock. 

Some phones(and tablets), including the Nexus 5, and the Nexus 7 have little metal discs embedded in the back plate of the phone. Our magnets line up with these metal discs, and pull quite nicely on them. 

Many phones have metal in their backs (the Galaxy phones all have some metal), so the magnets only help to hold the phone better. (More on each compatible phone below)

		 



		 

		 

This thing is awesome! How do I 

get one?

Our Story

So far in this journey we have gone through dozens of prototypes. Getting the right grip from the pad has been key. We discovered early that the back of the phone needs to be glossy for the phone to stick to the Air Dock. This means that if you have a phone that doesn't have a glossy back you will need to get a case that is glossy. This isn't a problem for most phones, as they are already glossy backed. 

We have had great success charging all phones through a case, as long as the case is not overly thick. Normal plastic cases, whether soft or hard work just fine, as long as they are glossy. 

The current working prototype has us really excited. Currently there are 6 of this version out in the real world getting used every day by our team of testers. (soon to be another 30 thanks to our ""tester"" backers!)

Greg, Our founder and CEO:

""I have been building things since I was a kid, and I love it. Building and testing the Air Dock has been a blast. I have used several different 3D printers to make all the different parts as I have experimented with different versions of the Air Dock. There is nothing I enjoy more than having an idea and then turning it into a finished and working product.""

		 



 

		 

At the moment we are using a 3D printer to make a few parts for the Air Dock. The purpose of this campaign is to get a large enough order to have all the plastic parts injection molded and push us over the edge into large scale production. 

The electronics of the charger are all sorted and ready for full production. We have already made arrangements with the factory producing them.  A large quantity order is ready to be placed as soon as funding is accomplished.

		 

What does the future hold?

We have the current version of the Air Dock perfected. There is no more design or functionality tweaking to be done. All we need at this point is enough funding to afford the high upfront cost of getting molds made for the Air Dock. We are really excited to get this version out there to people just like you!

We have received numerous requests and suggestions for ways to make future versions of the Air Dock better. A few of the ideas that we are considering are:


A magnetic version compatible with all phones


An NFC chip inside the Air Dock


An all black version 


We may try to implement some of these ideas into the current model of the Air Dock. It will depend on how much funding we get, and how smoothly everything goes! We are always up for a challenge! 

		 

		 

When will I get my Air Dock?

We are planning to have our first production run ship out in April 2014. If we sell out of these perks we will add additional perks for a second production run. This run will probably ship some time around June 2014 

		 



		 

Want to know more about your 

phone and the Air Dock?

Nexus 5


The Nexus 5 has little metal discs in the back plate of the phone that are placed right around the charging coil. We have magnets inside the Air Dock that align with these discs and pull on them to hold the phone in place. This works great for the black Nexus 5 because it's back isn't glossy and the micro-suction foam doesn't hold as firmly. The magnets instead do the holding. 

No matter which version of the Nexus 5 you have it will work great with the Air Dock. It will also work fine through a case, as long as the case is glossy, and not too thick.



		 

		 

		 

		 

Nexus 7


The nexus 7 has the same metal mounting discs in it's back as the Nexus 5. The black version is also just a little bit more glossy than it's Nexus 5 counterpart which helps make up for the extra weight of the Nexus 7. 

We have tested the Nexus 7 on the Air Dock and so far it is holding fine. We will continue testing for the Nexus 7 so that it can be used on the Air Dock. We think it's pretty cool that you can mount a full blown tablet on our Dock!

		 



		 

		 

		 

Galaxy S4


If you own a Galaxy S4 you have several options. 


Option 1 - Buy a Samsung brand replacement back cover for your phone. This back cover will have the wireless charging hardware built in. Once you have the new back cover, place your phone on the Air Dock and it will charge. The disadvantage to this option is that the replacement back cover is thicker than the original. This becomes a problem if you are trying to put your phone back into a hard case. If you don't use a case with your phone, this is a great option. This is also the highest quality receiver you can get. It is highly recommended. 



Option 2 - Buy an aftermarket wireless charging kit. This kit gets applied right over the battery under the original back cover. This keeps the phone closer to the same thickness so that it will fit more easily into a hard case. We will be testing different brands of these and recommending/supplying the one we find works best. They are aftermarket and are not as high of quality as the Samsung brand back cover. (they are a little bit cheaper though)

Think about the desktop; the first thing that comes to mind is the PC case. The
PC encloses all the other parts of the computer and has to be both functional
and good looking.<br/><br/>
We started this project by taking a look around and asking ourselves: “How can
we improve upon the key features of a PC case, the size and it’s modularity?” –
the answer we got was the DefconOne.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

Quertymaghttp://goo.gl/tVjoASThe Project
Hello
everyone, 
I present to you the DefconOne, a revolution in compact PC cases.
Technology is all around us; we all have some sort of computer, be it a
notebook, a tablet or a desktop PC.
Think about the desktop; the first thing that comes to mind is the PC case. The
PC encloses all the other parts of the computer and has to be both functional
and good looking.
We started this project by taking a look around and asking ourselves: “How can
we improve upon the key features of a PC case, the size and it’s modularity?” –
the answer we got was the DefconOne. 


The DefconOne is a compact PC case that in just
30 cm of length allows you to have the uncompromised performance you dream of, without
sacrificing your ability to choose the components.

But the DefconOne is not just a marvel of engineering, it’s also designed to be
stunning. The first thing you will notice are the two opening that allow you to
have your Nvidia or AMD graphic cards always in view, for an aggressive, yet
elegant look.
With the DefconOne we really wanted to push the limits of computer case
engineering by delivering you the smallest and best performing case that could
be designed.

For those who want to see all the technical data of our amazing product, here
they are. 
Width: 16cmLength: 30cmHeight: 37cmMotherboards supported: micro-ATX up to 240x240mmGraphic cards supported: 2 graphic cards up to 280mmStorage: up to 4 drives, 3.5"" and 2.5""Cooling: Liquid cooling for the CPU with 120mm fanYou and UsTo make the DefconOne a reality, we need your support, so here is what we'll do with your contributions:

 We'll make the prototypes and get started manufacturing asap.
We'll improve the product based on your feedback
We'll reinvest 70/90% of the revenues into new product creation

But of course we don't just ask you to believe in us, we also give you something back

Starting at the 10 euro contribution, you get a discount on the case, which increases with the increase of the contribution, in addition to cool gadgets like shirts and customized USB. If your contribution is high enough, you may even become a part of the team and get a share!
The first 1000 cases will all be numbered, and the first 100 will be a limited edition with a few special features
Before contributing, you may send us the name of your favourite graphic card and we'll show you what they will look like on the DefconOne; just email us at codenamedefconone@hotmail.com and we'll send you the final result asap!

<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 40px;"">
Writing or typing takes your attention away from what's going on around you. Cogi lets you take down what was just said with a single finger tap, so your attention can stay with the room.</p>
<h1 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How does it work?</h1>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 40px;"">
Cogi keeps the last few moments of audio buffered. When someone says something interesting, just tap the highlight button and Cogi backs up to capture and save what was just said. When the moment has passed, just tap again and Cogi will stop highlighting. You can have as many highlights in a session as you like.</p>

<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 40px;"">
Since Cogi only records the important moments, you can review exactly what was said without wasting time on all the jibber-jabber. Attach photos, videos and even text notes (if you’re still into that sort of thing). You can review images, transcriptions and text notes while listening to your highlights. You can also add tags and contacts to your sessions to give even more context.</p>

<h1 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">Who are we?</h1>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Cogi was formed by a group of technologists and entrepreneurs who have worked in the communications space for their entire careers.  The pain point of trying to capture the important points from a meeting, a lecture, and especially a phone call led to the creation of a communications platform specifically designed to make it trivial for anyone to capture these ideas, and just as importantly, be able to leverage that content.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And, as we all know, in today’s world, our lives are inundated with images and sounds… So, the application can capture the highlights of what we see and hear.  Think of this as a highlight reel for your day, whether you are a student attending lectures all day or, like the rest of us, participating in meetings or various phone calls throughout our day.

</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 40px;"">
Our goals are to make it easier for everyone to leverage what they see and hear, all the while ensuring that the focus can remain on the conversations at-hand and not on the tools we have created.  We believe this is a big problem that faces so many of us, and we are confident that we are delivering a most compelling solution.

<h1 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">Cogi Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Check out the answers to questions you might have. For many of these responses, we've included views of the application in action from our Android mobile app to help highlight the benefits of using Cogi.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">What is Cogi?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
It’s about focus, engagement and the sound bite...
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Cogi provides the most intuitive mobile applications to be able to CAPTURE, REVIEW and SHARE the important moments from our conversations, meetings, lectures, interviews, and phone calls, all situations where someone should remain engaged on important content.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
We have often considered these important moments as time periods from our day that needed to be highlighted. Sound bites are by definition a shorter piece of audio that represents a key idea of an longer audio segment, such as interviews, speeches, phone calls, etc. So, what Cogi allows you to do is capture these sound bites as they happen ""in nature"" and be able to easily and dynamically leverage those sound bites later.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">So, how does Cogi work?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Cogi stands for ""cogent idea"". The concept is simple. As we hear things that are important, often we can't easily remember or capture them. So, wouldn't it be great if we could remain focused on the topic at hand and yet capture these fleeting moments easily?
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
The Cogi concept is to remain focused on the conversation by presenting an easy-to-use experience. When you decide it’s time to start listening for these important thoughts, just start a session by tapping on the interface.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
With the session started, the Cogi application begins to buffer what you are listening to. Then, when something interesting is said, you tap the big Cogi button on your mobile application and a highlight is started. That’s
it.
</p>

<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">Cogi, just another recording application?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Yes, Cogi is a voice recording application. The “big idea” is to create an experience where you are focusing 100% of your attention on what you are listening to (ok, 99%, as you do have to tap that big Cogi button).
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
You remain engaged on the meeting, lecture or that important phone call from your most important client. We don't want you to worry about typing or writing or anything, especially on a mobile device.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And we do so much more than just recording the audio...
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">What about recording the entire meeting or lecture?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Seriously, if you recorded a 90-minute lecture or meeting that you sat through, what's the likelihood that you'd listen to it again?
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Zero.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
It wasn't necessarily that interesting the first time, or maybe it was, but who has the time to listen to all of it again? But there are usually valuable sound bites during that meeting or lecture. With Cogi, you can save those
easily.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">What about that ""aha moment""?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
While you are listening to whomever is talking, and you say to yourself, ""Gee, I should write that down"", you used to be required to change your focus and try to capture the idea on your computer or paper.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Now with Cogi, when you determine that something important is being said, you just tap that big Cogi button, and Cogi backs up to capture the context of what was said that drove that interest in the first place. You then just tap that button again when the ""interesting"" part of the conversation is over.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And don’t worry! We know that not everyone reacts the same. This back up feature is configurable to what works for each user. You can configure it from 5 seconds to 45 seconds, and that can be a lot of context!
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">We all brainstorm, so how to support the creative?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Just think about how many times someone said, “Oh, that was a great idea”, yet no one could remember exactly what was just said. With Cogi, you can essentially backup and capture these creative nuggets. It’s like a DVR for everything you hear (well, everything you hear that’s worth saving!).
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How to create the highlight reel from your day?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Consider our football Sundays.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
There are dozens of games, and perhaps we watch one or two.<span>  But for most games, we count on watching the highlights of all the big plays from all the games.
</span></p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
With Cogi, you apply that same concept for your meetings, lectures and phone calls... just capture the sound bites and any other context that might be help, such as that great diagram on the whiteboard.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How does multitasking help me?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
It doesn’t.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Many of us think that we are great at multitasking. The irony is that the comprehensive studies show that while multitasking, we are actually doing each task more poorly than if we focused on just one thing.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Stanford Communications Professor Dr. Clifford Nass stated that the only way to truly digest information that you are listening to would be to pause the speaker, reflect, take a note, or compose a question.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
So, is taking notes a form of multitasking? We think so.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
A solution like Cogi doesn’t quite achieve the objective of pausing the person speaking as Dr. Nass suggested, but it does capture that moment so that you can digest and/or reflect on it when convenient for you.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">But, writing helps me remember… what am I missing?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
We understand that for some people, the act of writing notes helps them remember and digest the content. We are not suggesting to always replace taking notes with Cogi. But, for so many situations, Cogi can capture things that note taking cannot.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And for those people that don’t take notes (or never have), Cogi can augment their ability to remember the key points from their day.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
We often work in a hybrid model. Write notes where notes make sense. Use Cogi when there’s just too much information to digest or when that content is really important and can’t be lost.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Oh, and you can take a picture of any notes you do take and add that image to your active Cogi session, keeping all of that related content together in one place.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How does Cogi get all of what I need?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Sometimes it takes us a few seconds (or more!) to register that something important is being said.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
But don’t worry, as Cogi is listening, just in case you needed that information. When you tap the highlight button, the Cogi application rewinds to record the context that led you to think to tap the button in the first place.</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And for those of you that worry about when Cogi is actively listening, we only have the microphone active if you have started a session. Otherwise, we are just waiting for you to let us know when the important stuff has started.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">What about what’s on the whiteboard or your own notes?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Cogi has even more tricks up its sleeve by allowing you to add text notes and pictures to your Cogi sessions to help you remember even more details from your meetings, lectures and conversations.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Think of a whiteboard where you drew diagrams or notes on and how nice it would be to see that content when reviewing your voice notes!
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How do I keep track of all my valuable highlights?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
You can tag your important highlights with a simple swipe and tap. Any time during a session, just slide from the right edge of the home screen or tap the tags icon on the home screen to easily add contact or text tags.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Contact tags typically reference a person’s name, such as @TheNameOfMyBoss. For text tags, the application has a number of predefined tags that you can use, like #FollowUp, or you can just add your own (e.g. #Photosynthesis).
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How can I capture the highlights from phone calls?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
You can just as easily capture these important highlights or sound bites on your phone calls, no longer trying to figure out how to remember important details when you are away from your desk.
</p>
<div style=""margin: 0 100px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/331008/files/20140126135900-03_-_Keypad_View.png?1390773540"" src="""" style=""width: 186.032px; height: 316px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330979/files/20140126134855-06_-_On_Call_-_No_Session.png?1390772935"" src="""" style=""width: 185.587px; height: 316px;""/>
</div>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Or, even if you are working from your office, taking a call and focusing on that call is important. Let Cogi capture the important sound bites. And, unlike most if not all of the mobile applications that claim to record phone calls, Cogi has built the infrastructure necessary to take the compelling and intuitive user experience and capture high-quality audio from of the call.
</p>
<div style=""margin: 0 100px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330970/files/20140126134654-07_-_On_Call_-_Idle.png?1390772814"" src="""" style=""width: 187.429px; height: 320px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330971/files/20140126134708-08_-_On_Call_-_Capturing.png?1390772828"" src="""" style=""width: 188.69px; height: 320px;""/>
</div>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">Ok, but is call recording legal?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Regulations vary from state to state (and country to country) regarding call recording. In the United States, most states (38 of them) are a ""one party"" consent state.  That means that if you want to and you are recording a call that you are participating on, then you are all good.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
The other states are ""all party"" consent states, and as the name implies, everyone on the call must consent to the recording.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
The bottom line is if you have reservations about consent, where applicable, then just have Cogi at the ready. Then, if and when the mood strikes, ask for consent. A simple example would be at the end of a long call where it's agreed to use Cogi for the final summary points and action items.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Just so many other cases...
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
The key to call recording regulations is that there are so many collaborative situations for almost everyone where call recording regulations are just not significant (e.g. collaboration with team where everyone already knows we are using Cogi).
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">Why does Cogi require calls to be routed through its systems?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Besides our clean user experience, which provides for a seamless environment for capturing the important highlights from your day, we built a scalable telephone infrastructure that allows us to capture the highest quality recordings from both or all sides of a telephone conversation.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Virtually all of the free recording applications in the app stores rely on hardware dependent and often unsupported capabilities of the mobile phones and mobile phone platforms to attempt to record phone calls. The results are inconsistent, device varying solutions.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
With Cogi, you can count on a perfect recording every time. And, with Cogi, you know when you are invoking the recording function on a call, with its clean user interface depicting who’s on the call.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How do you associate highlights, images and tags from a session?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
The killer review experience...
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
We've now captured these audio sound bites, images, video, contact tags, hashtags. What now? Listen to audio? Well, yes, we have to listen to the audio. But with Cogi's review experience, the user may have captured key images from the whiteboard or used contact tags to easily show who was in the meeting.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Thus, you can see who's participated (visually with the thumbnail pictures of the meeting participants) or view the content of the whiteboard, all while listening to these sound bites. Engage your brain looking at these visuals while you listen to the sound bites.

All of us can record audio, capture images and video and type notes in our phones with existing applications.<span>  The key with Cogi is being able to capture these elements and put them all into one place to easily associate a given sound bite with an image from the whiteboard while also remembering who was participating in the meeting.

<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How does this help with disabilities?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Whether for students or business people, there are many who have different sets of challenges. After all, don’t most of us have difficulties with focus from time to time?
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
At colleges and universities, accessibility must be provided under Americans with Disabilities Act and other governmental regulations.<span>  This is not just tied to students with vision, hearing or other physical impairments but to students with cognitive challenges (e.g. dyslexia, ADHD, etc.).
</span></p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Accessibility departments exist at most schools, and they are continually looking for solutions to help their students with the learning process.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Using the Cogi app can be the “cool” way to remain focused and obviate the need to take notes while listening in the lecture, study session, office hours, etc. And, for most students, the free application form of Cogi’s solution should work just fine.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
 And as it works for students in these contexts, does that not help the rest of us?
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">What if you’re listening in a language that’s not native?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
For learning or business contexts, listening to content in a different language can be a challenge, depending on your proficiency in that language.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Just imagine that there are parts of a lecture where one or two terms might make the entire context confusing. By using Cogi’s lightweight application, a student can later clarify the meaning of those terms, and re-listen to just that part of the lecture which may have been difficult.
</p>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
And, in some situations, having a written transcript of the sound bites further supports the comprehension process, as reading provides another way to digest the information.
</p>
<h3 style=""color: #FF9E15; text-align: center;"">How can I get these highlights transcribed?</h3>
<p style=""color: #58595b; text-align: center; margin: 10px 80px 20px;"">
Many of us would rather read than listen to recorded content.

Writing or typing takes your attention away from what's going on around you. Cogi lets you take down what was just said with a single finger tap, so your attention can stay with the room.
How does it work?

Cogi keeps the last few moments of audio buffered. When someone says something interesting, just tap the highlight button and Cogi backs up to capture and save what was just said. When the moment has passed, just tap again and Cogi will stop highlighting. You can have as many highlights in a session as you like.
Real screenshots from a real app available on the Google Play Store.
Spend less time reviewing.

Since Cogi only records the important moments, you can review exactly what was said without wasting time on all the jibber-jabber. Attach photos, videos and even text notes (if you’re still into that sort of thing). You can review images, transcriptions and text notes while listening to your highlights. You can also add tags and contacts to your sessions to give even more context.
No joke, you can take Cogi home today with nothing down and zero interest... ever... because it’s free.

How do our early adopters like it?

“Play Store is clogged with apps that reinvent the wheel (same or less features then built-in stock app). Recording apps are no exception. The Cogi recording app on the other hand is one of those gems that offers something new to the table. For this I give ""Cogi"" 5+ well deserved stars.”

Who are we?

Cogi was formed by a group of technologists and entrepreneurs who have worked in the communications space for their entire careers.  The pain point of trying to capture the important points from a meeting, a lecture, and especially a phone call led to the creation of a communications platform specifically designed to make it trivial for anyone to capture these ideas, and just as importantly, be able to leverage that content.


And, as we all know, in today’s world, our lives are inundated with images and sounds… So, the application can capture the highlights of what we see and hear.  Think of this as a highlight reel for your day, whether you are a student attending lectures all day or, like the rest of us, participating in meetings or various phone calls throughout our day.



Our goals are to make it easier for everyone to leverage what they see and hear, all the while ensuring that the focus can remain on the conversations at-hand and not on the tools we have created.  We believe this is a big problem that faces so many of us, and we are confident that we are delivering a most compelling solution.

ideas that you might have to improve the services we are delivering.

Cogi Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Check out the answers to questions you might have. For many of these responses, we've included views of the application in action from our Android mobile app to help highlight the benefits of using Cogi.

What is Cogi?

It’s about focus, engagement and the sound bite...


Cogi provides the most intuitive mobile applications to be able to CAPTURE, REVIEW and SHARE the important moments from our conversations, meetings, lectures, interviews, and phone calls, all situations where someone should remain engaged on important content.


We have often considered these important moments as time periods from our day that needed to be highlighted. Sound bites are by definition a shorter piece of audio that represents a key idea of an longer audio segment, such as interviews, speeches, phone calls, etc. So, what Cogi allows you to do is capture these sound bites as they happen ""in nature"" and be able to easily and dynamically leverage those sound bites later.

So, how does Cogi work?

Cogi stands for ""cogent idea"". The concept is simple. As we hear things that are important, often we can't easily remember or capture them. So, wouldn't it be great if we could remain focused on the topic at hand and yet capture these fleeting moments easily?


The Cogi concept is to remain focused on the conversation by presenting an easy-to-use experience. When you decide it’s time to start listening for these important thoughts, just start a session by tapping on the interface.


With the session started, the Cogi application begins to buffer what you are listening to. Then, when something interesting is said, you tap the big Cogi button on your mobile application and a highlight is started. That’s
it.




Cogi, just another recording application?

Yes, Cogi is a voice recording application. The “big idea” is to create an experience where you are focusing 100% of your attention on what you are listening to (ok, 99%, as you do have to tap that big Cogi button).


You remain engaged on the meeting, lecture or that important phone call from your most important client. We don't want you to worry about typing or writing or anything, especially on a mobile device.


And we do so much more than just recording the audio...

What about recording the entire meeting or lecture?

Seriously, if you recorded a 90-minute lecture or meeting that you sat through, what's the likelihood that you'd listen to it again?


Zero.


It wasn't necessarily that interesting the first time, or maybe it was, but who has the time to listen to all of it again? But there are usually valuable sound bites during that meeting or lecture. With Cogi, you can save those
easily.

What about that ""aha moment""?

While you are listening to whomever is talking, and you say to yourself, ""Gee, I should write that down"", you used to be required to change your focus and try to capture the idea on your computer or paper.


Now with Cogi, when you determine that something important is being said, you just tap that big Cogi button, and Cogi backs up to capture the context of what was said that drove that interest in the first place. You then just tap that button again when the ""interesting"" part of the conversation is over.


And don’t worry! We know that not everyone reacts the same. This back up feature is configurable to what works for each user. You can configure it from 5 seconds to 45 seconds, and that can be a lot of context!

We all brainstorm, so how to support the creative?

Just think about how many times someone said, “Oh, that was a great idea”, yet no one could remember exactly what was just said. With Cogi, you can essentially backup and capture these creative nuggets. It’s like a DVR for everything you hear (well, everything you hear that’s worth saving!).

How to create the highlight reel from your day?

Consider our football Sundays.


There are dozens of games, and perhaps we watch one or two.  But for most games, we count on watching the highlights of all the big plays from all the games.


With Cogi, you apply that same concept for your meetings, lectures and phone calls... just capture the sound bites and any other context that might be help, such as that great diagram on the whiteboard.

How does multitasking help me?

It doesn’t.


Many of us think that we are great at multitasking. The irony is that the comprehensive studies show that while multitasking, we are actually doing each task more poorly than if we focused on just one thing.


Stanford Communications Professor Dr. Clifford Nass stated that the only way to truly digest information that you are listening to would be to pause the speaker, reflect, take a note, or compose a question.


So, is taking notes a form of multitasking? We think so.


A solution like Cogi doesn’t quite achieve the objective of pausing the person speaking as Dr. Nass suggested, but it does capture that moment so that you can digest and/or reflect on it when convenient for you.

But, writing helps me remember… what am I missing?

We understand that for some people, the act of writing notes helps them remember and digest the content. We are not suggesting to always replace taking notes with Cogi. But, for so many situations, Cogi can capture things that note taking cannot.


And for those people that don’t take notes (or never have), Cogi can augment their ability to remember the key points from their day.


We often work in a hybrid model. Write notes where notes make sense. Use Cogi when there’s just too much information to digest or when that content is really important and can’t be lost.


Oh, and you can take a picture of any notes you do take and add that image to your active Cogi session, keeping all of that related content together in one place.

How does Cogi get all of what I need?

Sometimes it takes us a few seconds (or more!) to register that something important is being said.


But don’t worry, as Cogi is listening, just in case you needed that information. When you tap the highlight button, the Cogi application rewinds to record the context that led you to think to tap the button in the first place.

And for those of you that worry about when Cogi is actively listening, we only have the microphone active if you have started a session. Otherwise, we are just waiting for you to let us know when the important stuff has started.
What about what’s on the whiteboard or your own notes?

Cogi has even more tricks up its sleeve by allowing you to add text notes and pictures to your Cogi sessions to help you remember even more details from your meetings, lectures and conversations.


Think of a whiteboard where you drew diagrams or notes on and how nice it would be to see that content when reviewing your voice notes!

How do I keep track of all my valuable highlights?

You can tag your important highlights with a simple swipe and tap. Any time during a session, just slide from the right edge of the home screen or tap the tags icon on the home screen to easily add contact or text tags.


Contact tags typically reference a person’s name, such as @TheNameOfMyBoss. For text tags, the application has a number of predefined tags that you can use, like #FollowUp, or you can just add your own (e.g. #Photosynthesis).

How can I capture the highlights from phone calls?

You can just as easily capture these important highlights or sound bites on your phone calls, no longer trying to figure out how to remember important details when you are away from your desk.





Or, even if you are working from your office, taking a call and focusing on that call is important. Let Cogi capture the important sound bites. And, unlike most if not all of the mobile applications that claim to record phone calls, Cogi has built the infrastructure necessary to take the compelling and intuitive user experience and capture high-quality audio from of the call.




Ok, but is call recording legal?

Regulations vary from state to state (and country to country) regarding call recording. In the United States, most states (38 of them) are a ""one party"" consent state.  That means that if you want to and you are recording a call that you are participating on, then you are all good.


The other states are ""all party"" consent states, and as the name implies, everyone on the call must consent to the recording.


The bottom line is if you have reservations about consent, where applicable, then just have Cogi at the ready. Then, if and when the mood strikes, ask for consent. A simple example would be at the end of a long call where it's agreed to use Cogi for the final summary points and action items.


Just so many other cases...


The key to call recording regulations is that there are so many collaborative situations for almost everyone where call recording regulations are just not significant (e.g. collaboration with team where everyone already knows we are using Cogi).

Why does Cogi require calls to be routed through its systems?

Besides our clean user experience, which provides for a seamless environment for capturing the important highlights from your day, we built a scalable telephone infrastructure that allows us to capture the highest quality recordings from both or all sides of a telephone conversation.


Virtually all of the free recording applications in the app stores rely on hardware dependent and often unsupported capabilities of the mobile phones and mobile phone platforms to attempt to record phone calls. The results are inconsistent, device varying solutions.


With Cogi, you can count on a perfect recording every time. And, with Cogi, you know when you are invoking the recording function on a call, with its clean user interface depicting who’s on the call.

How do you associate highlights, images and tags from a session?

The killer review experience...


We've now captured these audio sound bites, images, video, contact tags, hashtags. What now? Listen to audio? Well, yes, we have to listen to the audio. But with Cogi's review experience, the user may have captured key images from the whiteboard or used contact tags to easily show who was in the meeting.


Thus, you can see who's participated (visually with the thumbnail pictures of the meeting participants) or view the content of the whiteboard, all while listening to these sound bites. Engage your brain looking at these visuals while you listen to the sound bites.





All of us can record audio, capture images and video and type notes in our phones with existing applications.  The key with Cogi is being able to capture these elements and put them all into one place to easily associate a given sound bite with an image from the whiteboard while also remembering who was participating in the meeting.

How does this help with disabilities?

Whether for students or business people, there are many who have different sets of challenges. After all, don’t most of us have difficulties with focus from time to time?


At colleges and universities, accessibility must be provided under Americans with Disabilities Act and other governmental regulations.  This is not just tied to students with vision, hearing or other physical impairments but to students with cognitive challenges (e.g. dyslexia, ADHD, etc.).


Accessibility departments exist at most schools, and they are continually looking for solutions to help their students with the learning process.


Using the Cogi app can be the “cool” way to remain focused and obviate the need to take notes while listening in the lecture, study session, office hours, etc. And, for most students, the free application form of Cogi’s solution should work just fine.


 And as it works for students in these contexts, does that not help the rest of us?

What if you’re listening in a language that’s not native?

For learning or business contexts, listening to content in a different language can be a challenge, depending on your proficiency in that language.


Just imagine that there are parts of a lecture where one or two terms might make the entire context confusing. By using Cogi’s lightweight application, a student can later clarify the meaning of those terms, and re-listen to just that part of the lecture which may have been difficult.


And, in some situations, having a written transcript of the sound bites further supports the comprehension process, as reading provides another way to digest the information.

How can I get these highlights transcribed?

Many of us would rather read than listen to recorded content.


With membership level services, you can easily request a transcript of a session or a given sound bite. Then you can just read the transcript of a given sound bite. Even better, you can do both, listen to the sound bite as the transcript is displayed in a ""teleprompter"" type rolling text pane.




And isn’t a picture really worth a thousand words?

Although the sound bites are central to the Cogi concept, augmenting these sound bites with images and video makes the experience much more rich. We just spent 45 minutes discussing a given topic, and we've used the whiteboard to capture many concepts.  Taking a picture of the whiteboard (or even your ""old school"" paper notes on your note pad) augments the sound bites that were captured.




Who was in that meeting?

You just met with your team, or, as a student, you just went to office hours with your professor or TA. With just a couple of taps, you can add a contact tag for each participant (or at least the important ones). If you have a picture associated with that contact on your mobile device, that picture is displayed during the review state, helping you remember who was there and what was being talked about.




Seriously, do any of us like typing on these mobile devices?

Let’s enter the no typing zone...


We have these mobile devices and the apps associated with them.  For many of us, the last thing that we want to do is start typing on this small device. One key theme with the Cogi application is to be able to do so many things with a tap or a swipe such that the minimum amount of typing or interacting with the application is achieved.


You can auto title your session just by adding contact tags for those that participated. You capture the audio with just a tap of the Cogi button. A couple of photos and you have the content of that meeting from the whiteboard.

And, does anyone really read manuals?

We don’t think so...


With Cogi, you get immediate and intuitive helps screens.  For many application views, you’ll see a help icon that you can tap to get further clarity on what’s going on.",37.0,1,"1 Campaign

</b></div>","µ-nex
A 100% Arduino IDE compatible,
32KB USB development board small enough to fit on your fingertips and cheap enough
to leave in any project.NOTE: In case you have forgotten to add shipping charges while pledging. Please make another contribution equaling the shipping charges (using the same e-mail ID previously used), and DO NOT select any perk. Sorry for any confusion.Story so far: u-nex? What? Why?Having used several
development boards over the years we soon realized that most of them
are designed to be used for a single purpose. Having hacked some to
increase functionality, we reasoned that not all boards would easily allow this
and soon realized the need for boards which are feature rich, cost effective,
yet easy to use and deploy in numerous applications. We set out to design such
boards and this is where it has led us, our first pit-stop: The µ-nex.The u-nex is a very compact Arduino
compatible board designed around the Atmega328p micro-controller. It features
32KB of flash memory with ALL the micro-controller pins being brought out to enable you
to build just about anything you would want to build with an 8-bit
micro-controller from autonomous flying vehicles to LED cubes. Designed from the ground up to
give you maximum possible versatility. It can be used as an Arduino
development board, AVR development board, FTDI breakout board or even an AVR
programmer. With on-board USB, it’s a breeze to design, test and deploy your projects.
And that’s not all. At the
heart of this campaign and as well as our goals, we aim to give you a high
quality product at a low cost so that you don’t have to think twice about leaving this board in your projects. We have two variants, one targeted
for development, the other is a lite version for deployment. Though the specifications are the same, the lite version excludes on-board USB and is priced at a lower cost making it perfect for all those applications which need a low cost set-up.How so cheap?We are a team of independent designers and our products are either sold directly by us or our direct distributors. This enables us to pass on the savings to you as we do not have to pay royalty to any third party to host/market the products on our behalf.We have also carefully selected our manufacturers and vendors who are willing to provide their services at minimal margins keeping in mind the production volumes we need.Features and Specifications:


Small size at just 17.78mm x 35.00mm
8-bit Atmega328p Micro-controller
Industry standard USB to serial converter with drivers
for Windows/Mac/Linux
Clock speed 16MHz
Hardware SPI & I2C
External power or USB power
Input voltage range 7-12V
Breadboard compatible
On board 5V,1A regulator, with supply to breadboard
14 Digital I/O Pins (of which 6 provide PWM output)
8 Analog Input Pins
External ADC reference pin
Power LED, serial LEDs, user configurable LED
Compatible with Arduino IDE for Windows/Mac/Linux
32KB of programmable flash memory (30KB program code space if using Arduino
boot-loader)

No more Misalignment, Low Speed Charging, Overheat and other less convenient aspects.Most wireless chargers don’t show you where the coils are, which leaves you trying repeatedly to get your phone charged properly. The worst case is you never notice your phone is misaligned and come back after the whole night to an empty battery. What’s more, your phone could overheat and damage the battery due to misalignment.Simply drop your device on AimCharge and it will automatically recognize, localize and track its coil for wireless charging with accurate charger alignment and at maximized charging speed. The light ring that moves with the coil indicates its location. The coil will remain where it was the last time for an immediate and effortless speedy wireless charging the next time you place the same phone on it. It’s definitely your most convenient wireless charger.To quickly and perfectly align the coils for you, an integrated MCU uses a patented algorithm to sample and compare as many as 2,600 power data sets when AimCharge is trying to couple its Tx coil and your device’s Rx coil. The sweet spot is then matched and identified by spotting the maximum transmission power. All this is  performed in just 4 seconds with a position error less than 0.18mm, only 36% of the diameter of a coil.To achieve the fastest charging speed, it is recommended to use a 18W Type-C adapter or above.The experimental result was averaged, the real result depends on the phone model.AimCharge features a smart charging system which can closely monitor the battery level and charging status based on different phone models, and deliver the right amount of power, which tops out at 20W, to the right device during the whole process. No matter what device it is, AimCharge juices it up the fastest and the safest.AimCharge is guaranteed to work with almost all devices that support wireless charging. In addition to all standard smartphones, it can charge all kinds of earbuds steadily and effortlessly.No need to worry if your smartphone has a case. AimCharge is compatible with cases that are up to 5mm thick. It means that you don’t have to remove the case to charge your phone.You can easily activate facial recognition and make video calls in Portrait Orientation, or watch videos in Landscape—all without ever cutting power. You can scroll or view seamlessly while your device powers up.Auto-Alignment Technology controls temperature to stay below 131℉ (55°C) at all times, fast charging while keeping it cool. It extends your phone’s battery life by preventing overheating and relating damages.The LED indicator will keep flashing when a foreign object is detected.AimCharge is sleep-friendly without beep, annoying lights and any other distraction brought by the LED indicator, giving you a sweet sleep.

Origami, which is a Japanese traditional art form of paper folding, is not only a beautiful piece of art, but also has use cases in engineering and architecture. Even NASA is using Origami structure on their satellites! 
  The different colors of FODI can complement your style.  FODI can hold Switch perfectly.  
FODI can hold up iPhone, iPad, iPad Pro and much more.   The world is multi-dimensional and so is FODI. Despite having a strong structure, FODI weighs only 0.08 lbs (40g), which means FODI can quite literally transform into a piece of paper when laid flat. With a thickness of only 1mm, you can easily put FODI in your bag, laptop or even use it as a bookmark!
 With our unique patent-pending origami structure, FODI can hold up to 44 lbs (20kg) of weight! As you can see from the photo above, FODI can easily hold 4 stacks of A4 papers.
Compared to an ordinary stand, FODI is extremely light and easy to store!  FODI comes with 2 magnetic buckles - in 2 different sizes so they will fit all charging cables. They come on and off easier, absolutely no glue or tape needed! Buckles get rid of tangling and it holds the cable firmly, making sure you don’t drop it! The powerful buckles can also pin memos and note to the FODI when you are not recharging. Multitasking just like FODI itself.

 
 Made with environmentally-friendly fibre paper, FODI is water and stain-resistant, which means you can easily clean it. There’s no hassle, even if you accidentally spill your coffee all over your desk!   Laptops, tablets and smartphones are designed for our convenience, yet their extensive usage, especially while sitting at a desk, can lead to various health issues. These include bad posture, stiff neck and back pain. With FODI, you can continue using your devices, all while keeping a comfortable, and most importantly, healthy posture.FODI is not only good for your health, but can also improve your device's condition. By increasing space between your laptop and the surface, FODI improves the natural convection of air, thus reducing the risk of overheating.  Unlike ordinary paper, our patented fibre paper offers multiple advantages. Made of polypropylene fibre, the texture is much stronger than that of normal paper, it is water and stain resistant and can even withstand up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit or 120 degrees Celsius. Additionally, FODI is not wood-made, so there is no mold threat.FODI doesn’t just support your electronic devices, it also supports our earth. The outer layer of FODI is made of patented polypropylene fibre paper, which is very durable and most importantly recyclable.During the early stages of product development, we decided to use the origami technique in order to succeed in designing and creating an ultra-slim product form. Our fibre paper has enabled us to create FODI without compromising on any of the product's features.Keeping in mind the small-scale, neat design of popular laptops and tablets available on the market, we made FODI as compact as possible. After countless adjustments, we came up with the ultimate size for all users and devices, guaranteed to meet your individual needs.

We've reached our $50,000 goal! 
The success of this project would not have been possible without the support, the belief and the contribution of my 487 funders. THANK YOU! (please click on update to see the full update and to follow the progress of the XStylus Touch)

What is the XStylus Touch?
The XStylus Touch is a transforming wide-grip heavy weight touch pen for the iPad.  

It comes with a discreet, secure, crystal clear magnetic holder so that you can carry both your iPad and your touch pen in style, anytime, anywhere!
 
The XStylus Touch is available in glossy black + metal, and glossy white + metal.



 

  
What kind of user experience does XStylus Touch provide?
XStylus Touch simulates the user experience of a quality (or expensive) fountain pen.

 

 
Why the XStylus?
 

Bring it everywhere


The minimalistic crystal clear magnetic holder allows you to securely carry your XStylus and iPad to meetings, to classes, to rehearsals or to the cafe. The holder has been tested on over 50 popular iPad cases, and itï¿½s very likely that you can continue to enjoy your cool iPad case with the XStylus Touch.





Responsive pen tip



The tip of the XStylus Touch glides smoothly on any glass screen and is optimized for sensitivity so that even the slightest strokes are registered. You will rarely need to retouch the beginning of your strokes with your XStylus Touch. Check out our iPad styli review video (3M Smart Pen vs Bamboo vs XStylus Touch)





Play, create and work longer with an ergonomic wide-grip stylus



The bulk weight XStylus Touch is distributed in the triangle formed between your thumb and your index finger in the grip.  The combination of weight and grip size minimizes strain to your wrist and forearm, thus allowing you to play, create, and work longer.


 

Be cool and original! 


By supporting this project, you will be part of a small group of people in the world turning an user-oriented idea into a marketable product, hopefully, there'll be at least 2000 of us. We hope to produce a limited quantity of the XStylus Touch at this initial stage.  Hope you'll join us in this exciting adventure!
 

 

 





 
What You Get
$15 per XStylus Touch + Holder for the first 200 funders.  
It'd be in either glossy black or glossy white, so it's gonna be a total surprise! :)

$25 per XStylus Touch + Holder for everyone else afterwards.
 
 

 

 
What We Need
Our project goal is US$50,000 and itï¿½s the bare minimum amount for me to start the production of the XStylus Touch.  This cost includes the cost of...

wax moulding for the metallic part (pen core), 
injection moulding for the plastic part (pen body),
labour intensive hand polishing, 
stainless steel screws,
assembly, 
sourcing and trial of the raw materials, 
the initial prototypes by CNC technology, 
packaging,
shipping charges etc...  
 
 

 
Why is it so expensive?
The metal pen core is made entirely of solid metal and it's pricey as it's made from wax moulding.  A method commonly used to make precious metal jewelry.  Each piece will then be hand polished to the quality you see in the photos.  

Since this piece is the heart and soul (and weight) of this pen, we will ""forge"" ahead using this iron alloy, which really feels and looks incredible for its weight and polishing.

The XStylus Touch prototype weighs 32 grams. The final product will be very close to this weight, making it one of the heaviest iPad styli on the market. It really feels great in the hand and we've already done all the legwork by choosing the perfect material and the manufacturing process. 
So, once we reach our goal, we can kick in production right away.  This back and forth process has taken us over 3 months and here are a few photo showing the prototyping process and visits to the factories.
 

 




 

  


 
Really, why it is so expensive? 
In additional to manufacturing and prototyping cost, should we reach our goal in 60 days, the cost of fundraising is US$3,500 in commission, exchange rate fees and transaction fees.  This sum goes to IndieGoGo and Paypal.  So, I'd really end up with just around US$46,500 to produce just around 2000 copies of this stylus.
 
So, that explains why this project is so costly.  But if we can get enough people to want XStylus Touch and XStylus holder, we might just be able to materialize this idea into something beautiful and useful.

So, you can support this project in full confidence. This is our promise to you and it's a risk we are taking.
 

 
So, is this a ""All-or-Nothing"" Funding Model?
 
Yes, it is.  You will receive a full refund if we don't reach our ambitious goal. Promise.

<p><strong>Are</strong> you a cell-phone user or someone intending to buy a cell-phone plan in the near future?</p>
<p><strong>Do</strong> you find it difficult to figure out what is the best cell phone plan out there?</p>
<p><strong>Are</strong> you annoyed by the multiple time-consuming steps you have to take to find the best plan?</p>
<p>Our research shows users spend a lot of time browsing the Internet, talking to friends &amp; family, visiting multiple stores and talking to service providers trying to find a plan and still not getting what they want. <strong>Actually</strong>…</p>
<p><strong>Did</strong> <strong>you know</strong> that our research shows users spend on average <strong>2 hrs</strong> looking for a cell-phone plan? What if we could cut that search time to less than 30 seconds through 1 Click Search?</p>
<p><strong>Did</strong> <strong>you know</strong> that <strong>82%</strong> of the online shoppers look for some sort of assistance with their purchase; you are probably one of them. What if we could connect you with the service providers instantly to get your questions answered?</p>
<p><strong>Did</strong> <strong>you know</strong> that the Canadian government actually spent <strong>$1.4million in 2009</strong> to build a cell-phone rate calculator because consumers like you expressed frustration with paying high phone bills, only to abandon it right before launch?</p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong> has tried for years to build a competitive wireless environment to provide consumers with more choices in pricing, plans, and features.  Actually, in Canada, despite massive capital investments by the new entrants, the incumbents still control 95% of the market. Judgements and political arguments aside, the incontrovertible truth of the matter is that consumers in Canada are still paying one of the highest cell-phone plan prices in the world!</p>
<p><strong>Choice</strong>, as it turns out, promised by the government and endorsed by the market leaders, is still very limited and the pent up frustration shared by consumers is being reflected in higher churn rates. Despite flanker brands like Chatr, Koodo, Fido, Solo and Virgin, consumers do not have true choice.</p>
<p><strong>Just Imagine…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong> how great it would be to be able to compare cell-phone plans side-by-side in one screen, tailored to the exact information you provide for what you need, and then connect directly to the service provider who offers this plan without the hassle of all the inefficient steps.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong> how much bargaining power we (cell-phone users and intenders) could have if we were armed with the right knowledge when talking to service provider agents – both when buying/contracting a new plan or re-negotiating an existing one.</p>
<p>In a world of so much information, <strong>Big Data</strong>, why is it still difficult for cell-phone users to get access to information on great cell-phone plans that meet their needs and doesn’t cost a fortune?  While Big Data appears to only serve big companies wanting to sell us more, we can use Big Data for the <strong>consumer benefit</strong> by providing cell-phone users with all the information about different Carriers’ plans in one place, making it easier to compare different plans side-by-side.</p>
<p><strong>This</strong> is exactly what <a href=""http://ucompareplans.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>http://ucompareplans.com/</strong></a> aims to do! You can visit our Technology Preview Website to see the model and get more information.</p>

Our research shows users spend a lot of time browsing the Internet, talking to friends & family, visiting multiple stores and talking to service providers trying to find a plan and still not getting what they want. Actually…
Did you know that our research shows users spend on average 2 hrs looking for a cell-phone plan? What if we could cut that search time to less than 30 seconds through 1 Click Search?
Did you know that 82% of the online shoppers look for some sort of assistance with their purchase; you are probably one of them. What if we could connect you with the service providers instantly to get your questions answered?
Did you know that the Canadian government actually spent $1.4million in 2009 to build a cell-phone rate calculator because consumers like you expressed frustration with paying high phone bills, only to abandon it right before launch?
Canada has tried for years to build a competitive wireless environment to provide consumers with more choices in pricing, plans, and features.  Actually, in Canada, despite massive capital investments by the new entrants, the incumbents still control 95% of the market. Judgements and political arguments aside, the incontrovertible truth of the matter is that consumers in Canada are still paying one of the highest cell-phone plan prices in the world!
Choice, as it turns out, promised by the government and endorsed by the market leaders, is still very limited and the pent up frustration shared by consumers is being reflected in higher churn rates. Despite flanker brands like Chatr, Koodo, Fido, Solo and Virgin, consumers do not have true choice.
Just Imagine…
Imagine how great it would be to be able to compare cell-phone plans side-by-side in one screen, tailored to the exact information you provide for what you need, and then connect directly to the service provider who offers this plan without the hassle of all the inefficient steps.
Imagine how much bargaining power we (cell-phone users and intenders) could have if we were armed with the right knowledge when talking to service provider agents – both when buying/contracting a new plan or re-negotiating an existing one.
In a world of so much information, Big Data, why is it still difficult for cell-phone users to get access to information on great cell-phone plans that meet their needs and doesn’t cost a fortune?  While Big Data appears to only serve big companies wanting to sell us more, we can use Big Data for the consumer benefit by providing cell-phone users with all the information about different Carriers’ plans in one place, making it easier to compare different plans side-by-side.
This is exactly what http://ucompareplans.com/ aims to do! You can visit our Technology Preview Website to see the model and get more information.
Canada, it’s time to wake-up, voice your opinion, shake the industry and demand more choice with fair pricing!

<p>“When developing the app, it was important to us to make it parent-friendly so that you can use bestSitter anytime from anywhere via the internet.

<p>Ein Team aus vier jungen Menschen aus Köln bilden das Team von bestBuddi. Timo hatte die Idee für ein Babyfon für Smartphones und holte Tanja, Isabel und Sassan ins Boot. Daraufhin haben wir sechs Monate lang geplant, entwickelt und organisiert um unsere Vision zu realisieren. Jetzt können wir mit Stolz und Freude sagen: Made with love in Cologne.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bestbuddi.com/indiegogo/german/1notthesmartphone.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fast jeder Smartphone-Besitzer hat dieses maximal eine Armlänge von sich entfernt und verwendet es über den Tag hinweg unzählige Male zum Telefonieren, Nachrichten senden, im Internet surfen etc…</p>
<p><br/>Wir lieben es! Mittels WLAN und einem Kameramodul mit integriertem Infrarot kann bestSitter Geräusche und Bilder mithilfe einer App auf das Smartphone übertragen. Der Sender kann beispielsweise am Kinderbettchen befestigt werden. Sobald das Baby Laute von sich gibt, meldet sich die App mit einem Hinweiston und informiert über die Aktivität des Nachwuchs..<br/><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://bestbuddi.com/indiegogo/german/2buddi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ein optisches Highlight bietet bestSitter auch: Im Gegensatz zu den gewöhnlich sterilen Plastikboxen anderer Babyphones, hat bestSitter eine kinderfreundliche Hülle – <strong>eine Nickifigur, die den Namen Buddi trägt.</strong> <br/><br/>Zudem soll jeder Buddi einzigartig sein. Deshalb sollen die Nickihüllen auch von Personen angefertigt werden, die Spaß am Nähen haben. Nebenbei können sich diese ihre Rente aufbessern oder ein kleines Taschengeld dazu verdienen.</p>
<p>Hier seht Ihr wie Buddi's Innenleben aussieht, ein Baby Fon mit allen technischen Finessen in einer Hülle aus Nicki! Wenn Ihr kreativ seid, könnt Ihr sogar eigene Buddi's basteln!</p>

<p>Bestsitter unterstützt alle modernen SmartPhone betriebssysteme, Windowsphone 8, Android und natürlich auch Geräte wie iPhones und iPads.</p>

<p>Um bestSitter bei Freunden und Bekannten zu benutzen muss entweder eine direkte Verbindung mit dem Telefon oder hergestellt werden oder bestSitter in ein WLan Netzwerk eingebunden. Die Verwendung ist so einfach, das jeder der eine Smartphone App benutzen kann in der Lage ist bestSitter einzusetzen.</p>
<p>Wenn du Unterwegs bist, kannst du jeder Zeit über dein SmartPhone auf bestSitter zu Hause zugreifen, Voraussetzung dafür ist eine Mobiledatenverbindung mit dem Telefon.</p>

<p>Ich kann jederzeit einen Blick ins Kinderzimmer werfen, wenn ich meine Tochter vermisse, sogar wenn ich einem Meeting bin!“ - <strong>Sassan</strong></p>
<p>„Als ich die Idee für das Babyphone hatte, war mir klar, dass es ein leistungsstarkes, einfach zu bedienendes und portables Gerät sein musste. Zudem durfte es kein Plastik-Objekt sein, sondern die Möglichkeit bieten, verschiedene Hüllen zu nutzen, wie bei den meisten Smartphones heutzutage. Nach vielen Stunden vor dem Lötkolben kam dabei bestSitter heraus“ -  <strong>Timo </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Bei der Planung der App war wichtig, dass diese elternfreundlich ist, so dass jederzeit von überall via Internet auf bestSitter zugegriffen werden kann. Ein großer Bruder für Babys, der immer da ist und die Eltern alarmiert, sobald es unruhig ist. Ein weiterer von vielen Vorteilen ist, dass es selbst in die überfüllteste Handtasche passt und somit immer dabei ist“ – <strong>Tanja</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Als ich den kleinen Buddi designte, war mir vor allem wichtig, dass er freundlich wirkt und Lust zum Anfassen bereitet – ein kleiner Aufpasser also, der im metaphorischen Sinne den Babys stets zur Seite steht und sie wie ein guter Freund begleitet.“ – <strong>Isabel</strong></p>

bestSitter offers also a visual highlight or stands out visually: compared with common box-type baby-monitors, bestSitter has a child-friendly cover – a soft toy or cuddly toy named 'Buddi'.
Almost every smartphone owner has it within arm’s reach. Smartphones are used every day or 24/7 or on a daily basis to make phonecalls, send texts, surf the net etc …
Enjoy the Video! Comment the Project with your Feedback!
 
 

bestBuddi - we are 4 People from Cologne who believe that there is a modern, safe way to look after our kids. Timo started developing bestSitter and Tanja, Isabel and Sassan came on board or joined the team! We spent about six month planning and organising our vision, we now can proudly say: Made in Cologne - with love.
 

Almost every smartphone owner has it within arm’s reach. Smartphones are used every day or 24/7 or on a daily basis to make phonecalls, send texts, surf the net etc …We love it! Via wifi and a camera, equipped with infrared, sounds and images are transferred through the app to your smartphone. For example, you could attach the sender to the cot and if your baby cries the app gives a notification with a supervisory tone and informs about the activity of the baby.
 

bestSitter offers also a visual highlight or stands out visually: compared with common box-type baby-monitors, bestSitter has a child-friendly cover –a soft toy or cuddly toy named 'Buddi'. Each ‘Buddi’ is unique and made by people who enjoy tailoring and sewing. And thus we enable people to top up their pension or earn some pocket money while doing something they enjoy; our motto is handmade instead of mass production. We want ‘Buddi’ to be made globally, so if you are purchasing ‘Buddi’ in the USA, your ‘Buddi’ will be made in the USA.
 



BestSitter supports all modern Smartphones or tablets with iOS, Android or Windows 8 and Windows phone 8.
» Supports iPhone, iPad, Android and Windows phones  » WiFi b/g/n » IR Camera 3MP » Battery pack » Micro USB » Handmade ‘Buddi’ cover
To use BestSitter on the go, your mobile device requires a direct WiFi connection to bestSitter or an internet Connection if bestSitter is located at home.
 
We believe in a good infrastructure not only at our office, therefor we created a plan which is perfect for our economy. You may read that bestBuddi is made by retired people in your country for stocking their pension. We are doing the same with the Hardware, everything is then “Made in [YOUR COUNTRY HERE]” from Productbox to assembly including Buddi. This is also the best Base for having components which are safe in your environment, including better localized Apps and creating Jobs around the world. On Successful founding we will create an office in North America for the best Product Support you can imagine.
 

""I can now have a look at bestSitter when I feel like checking up on my daughter, even while in a business meeting"" - Sassan
 
“I believe in this product and for me it’s the best solution, having a ‘Buddi’ to monitor my kids.  When I had the idea I knew that it has to be be a high-performance, user-friendly and portable device. To stand out, different ‘Buddi’ covers are available, like most smartphones have today.  After many hours behind the drawing board, bestSitter was born” - Timo
 
“When developing the app, it was important to us to make it parent-friendly so that you can use bestSitter anytime from anywhere via the internet. Like a big brother, who is always by your side and alerts the parents as soon as something is happening. Another benefit is that it fits everywhere and is always present“ - Tanja
 
“When I designed the little ‘Buddi’ it was important to me, that he it looks friendly and made from tactile materials – so a little “watch dog” who is always by the side of babies and like a best buddy accompanies them everywhere.” - Isabel

The iDrunk software will notice your attempts post to the Internet and will prompt you to blow into our nip-bottle housed breathalyzer. It will only allow your post to the Internet if you are sober enough to post. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ What's in the little bottle? </strong><br/><span>     Unlike products that rely on dexterity skills to test inebriation, the iDrunk uses a specially designed electronic breathalyzer that measures your blood alcohol content. This specially designed hardware communicates your sobriety level via USB or Bluetooth technology to your Smartphone or PC. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ Can I download the iDrunk software and use it with out the iDrunkbreathalyzer? </strong><br/><span>     No, the iDrunk software requires the iDrunkbreathalyzer be connected to your PC in order to block or permit traffic based on sobriety levels. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ How drunk do I have to be before the iDrunk will stop me? </strong><br/><span>     Since the effect of alcohol on people varies from person to person the iDrunk lets you set your own level of impaired judgment. Fine tuning the settings of the iDrunk just may be the most fun youÕll ever have when configuring a computer peripheral. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ Which web sites will the iDrunk work for? </strong><br/><span>     The iDrunk will work for any web site you can send data to. It comes preprogramed to block posts to Twitter and Facebook. Through the user interface you can add any social media, gambling or shopping sites you wish. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ What browsers does the iDrunk support? </strong><br/><span>     Currently the iDrunk works with Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ Will purchasing an iDrunk make me more attractive to the opposite sex? </strong><br/><span>     Yes, yes it will. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ If the iDrunk says I'm sober, does that mean I am ok to drive an automobile? </strong><br/><span>     The iDrunk is for entertainment purposes only. Although we at iDrunk enjoy having a good time we remind everybody that being sober enough to post does not mean you are sober enough to drive. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ Who should purchase an iDrunk? </strong><br/><span>     You should. If youÕve read through this FAQ all the way to question 10 you know you want one. It also makes a great gift for friends who like to enjoy life but donÕt know when to shut up about it. You know the people weÕre talking about;the people who repeatedly make embracing posts that leave you shaking your head. You owe it them to get them one too. </span><br/><br/><strong>¥ Who makes the iDrunk? </strong><br/><span>     The iDrunk is the flagship product of 4 Wizard LLC. 4 Wizard is committed to producing the finest electronic and software products for the connected life in the 21st century. </span><span><br/></span></p></div>","¥ What is the iDrunk?     The iDrunk is a technological breakthrough that prevents people from posting to social media sites, uploading videos, making wagers on online gambling sites, making expensive impulse purchases or performing other acts of questionable judgment; acts they would not perform had they not consumed too much alcohol to make better decisions. ¥ How does the iDrunk work?      Using a combination of cutting edge computer hardware and software the iDrunk will prevent you from sending information to web sites that you want to protect yourself from.

<p> <br/>A number of factors went into enabling the Firefly iPhone Case to help your iPhone get better reception.</p>
<p>This chart shows how our technology improves your reception in three important ways:</p>
<div data-id=""19436982""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1515549603/hr4mmilfq37byfwqss8t.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<div data-id=""19438067""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Firefly gives your phone an optimal coverage pattern."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1515549603/kyzdtaixacawrs9pbkdz.png"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">Firefly gives your phone an optimal coverage pattern.</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Firefly is essentially a super antenna that captures your phone's energy and re-radiates with the most optimal coverage pattern. The measured data below details this pattern with a peak gain of 4+dBi. It is of our base antenna element in free space at port 1. The testing was certified by MET Laboratories, Inc.</p>
<p>You just can't stick something on your phone and claim to improve signal reception. The antennas in your phone are inherently narrowband, which means they cover a specific frequency pipeline.</p>
<p>The problem is that narrowband antennas can be sensitive to detuning.  Remember Antenna Gate for the iPhone 4? The end user's hand shifted the phone's frequency, which induced loss of connectivity. The bumper add-on was a loading solution to minimize the detuning from the frequency shift.</p>
<p><b>Since Firefly is a broadband and frequency diverse solution, we essentially eliminate detuning issues! </b></p>
<div data-id=""19436255""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1515549604/cunksqjucrx8nfzq4tgp.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p><br/>We all know the pain of a dropped iPhone, don't we! It's not fun, but unfortunately it happens all too often.</p>
<p>The Firefly case frame itself, however, is more than just a sleek home for the signal enhancing antenna. Its WavGEL inner liner absorbs kinetic energy and is built into a shock-absorbing TPU for reinforced 12-foot drop protection (phone + screen). Its corners are reinforced for extra protection, too.</p>
<p>All this state-of-the-art protection keeps your iPhone and its screen incredibly secure!</p>

<p><br/>But we didn’t stop there. We knew the case had to look as great as it protects, and as well as our technology performs. So we decided to add a luminescent outer layer to the frame that provides a soft glow in the dark. That's why it's called the Firefly!</p>

Dropped calls, slow data, and constantly needing to recharge are the biggest annoyance for iPhone owners.
All are caused by a weak signal.
When your phone has to constantly search for a signal, this slows performance and drains your battery.
Our new Firefly iPhone Case with patented Super Antenna Technology built right in solves this problem!
This results in improved cellular, WiFi, AND Bluetooth connectivity.
The Firefly is also incredibly shock absorbent — no more broken screens, even from a 12-foot drop onto concrete!
Compared to comparably priced iPhone cases, the Firefly does MUCH more.
Available for the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, 8, X, and all Plus models.


 

Firefly is the world’s first iPhone case that not only protects your phone, but improves your global cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth signals, which help save battery power at the same time.
We've built our patented new Super Antenna Technology right into the Firefly case, so dropped calls, slow data, and constantly having to charge your battery are things of the past!

Maybe you want an improved signal in your home, so you don’t have to worry about dead spots and dropping calls? Or perhaps you are tired of being “that guy” on the conference call with a bad connection….

We believe that a better connection makes the world a better (and safer) place, in so many ways.
You'll enjoy flawless FaceTime calls, enhanced gaming, interruption-free streaming, and fast load times with your favorite apps, thanks to improved data speed with the Firefly case.
Plus with enhanced data speed your phone's GPS will work better, so you can safely go farther and stay connected on your next road trip, beach vacation, or hiking adventure.
As you can see from this speed test, the FireFly iPhone Case increases your data speeds dramatically! 

We tried out an iPhone with no Firefly case on it and got only 1 bar, resulting in poor connection, a constantly drained battery, and dropped calls. Then we put on the Firefly case, reset the connection, and instantly improved the signal to a solid 2 bars!

 

 A number of factors went into enabling the Firefly iPhone Case to help your iPhone get better reception.
This chart shows how our technology improves your reception in three important ways:

 
Firefly gives your phone an optimal coverage pattern.
Firefly is essentially a super antenna that captures your phone's energy and re-radiates with the most optimal coverage pattern. The measured data below details this pattern with a peak gain of 4+dBi. It is of our base antenna element in free space at port 1. The testing was certified by MET Laboratories, Inc.
You just can't stick something on your phone and claim to improve signal reception. The antennas in your phone are inherently narrowband, which means they cover a specific frequency pipeline.
The problem is that narrowband antennas can be sensitive to detuning.  Remember Antenna Gate for the iPhone 4? The end user's hand shifted the phone's frequency, which induced loss of connectivity. The bumper add-on was a loading solution to minimize the detuning from the frequency shift.
Since Firefly is a broadband and frequency diverse solution, we essentially eliminate detuning issues! 

We all know the pain of a dropped iPhone, don't we! It's not fun, but unfortunately it happens all too often.
The Firefly case frame itself, however, is more than just a sleek home for the signal enhancing antenna. Its WavGEL inner liner absorbs kinetic energy and is built into a shock-absorbing TPU for reinforced 12-foot drop protection (phone + screen). Its corners are reinforced for extra protection, too.
All this state-of-the-art protection keeps your iPhone and its screen incredibly secure!

 

Here you can see an iPhone in a Firefly case being dropped from a 12-foot ladder onto a concrete floor....



 And here it gets thrown against a brick wall....

The iPhone in its sturdy Firefly case comes through with flying colors, even when subjected to the dreaded ninja throw!

But we didn’t stop there. We knew the case had to look as great as it protects, and as well as our technology performs. So we decided to add a luminescent outer layer to the frame that provides a soft glow in the dark. That's why it's called the Firefly!

 

 
WavStand
The WavStand allows you to prop up your phone either vertically or horizontally, which is great for when you want to have a hands-off conversation on speakerphone or watch a streaming movie.
WavStand
It folds flat and is magnetic, which comes in very handy for attaching your phone to the fridge or other metallic surface:

The WavStand is included with several of the rewards, listed on the right and in the chart below.

 Another reward bonus is our tempered glass screen protector:

 ECLIPSE is available in Taupe | Walnut Wood, and Marine | Cherry Wood.ECLIPSE Marble Edition is available in Black Aluminum | Black Marble, and Gold Aluminum | White Marble. ECLIPSE is available with a Type A/B, Type C/E/F/J/L, Type G, or Type I electrical plug. Not sure what electrical plug type you need? Check out the list of electrical plugs by country. If ECLIPSE isn't available with your country's plug type, don't worry! It's 110-240V, so you can always use an adapter. 

 
 
We rely on our tech more and more every day, but all these devices need charging. This means more cables – cables that quickly get chaotic.
 

ECLIPSE is the only USB charging hub you won’t want to hide away. With its compact and round design, it can live on your nightstand, desk, and even your wall using the included wall mount.
 

Up to three of your USB cables are wound into their own precision-engineered channel, so you’ll never have to worry about them tangling or overlapping. 
 

We designed ECLIPSE to be as user-friendly as possible, so you can use the cables you already own (up to 8 feet).
 

Since your cables are safe and secure in ECLIPSE, they’ll be out of the way from everyday dangers like people tripping on them, rolling chairs, playful cats, and cable thieves (you know who you are).
 

Cable boxes and charging stations just hide your mess of cables and force you to untangle them before charging. With ECLIPSE, you can access your cables and unwind them to their maximum length easily and without frustration.
 

ECLIPSE comes with a braided power cable, essentially extending each of your charging cables by an extra 4 feet.
 

ECLIPSE exists to get rid of cable clutter, that's why the power cable comes with a genuine leather strap. If you don't need a full 4 feet for your power cable, just wrap it up and keep things neat.
 

Now you only need one power socket for your daily charging needs. 
 

Unlike a lot of underpowered USB hubs out there, ECLIPSE uses smart IC technology to ensure that your devices are always charging at their maximum speed (up to 2.4A, and 3A via USB-C).
 

Always ahead of the curve? We hear you. For the early adopters among you, one of ECLIPSE’s USB-A ports can be turned into a USB-C port.
 

Why would you trust a cheap power adapter to charge your expensive tech? ECLIPSE uses an advanced transformer to guarantee safe currents that won’t damage your devices’ batteries in the long term.
 

With a single touch, ECLIPSE rises and emits a subtle halo, so you can forget about fumbling around for your cable in the dark. Tap it once more and its halo fades away - along with your cable frustration.
 

 

About a year ago, we started to work on a new product with the ambition to transform the way we charge at home. After multiple design directions and prototypes, we are now in the final stage of the development.

<p><span>Brad: Chad, wake up...the auction for the suit of armor is scheduled to end in 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>Chad: What time is it?</span></p>
<p><span>Brad: It's 3:30am, but based on our research this is the best time to buy! Now get up and get ready to bid.</span></p>
<p><span>Chad: Can't we try another night? You know, when it's not so late!</span></p>
<p><span>Brad: No, unless you are willing to pay a premium. Don't make me push you out of the bed!</span></p>
<p><span>Chad: Fine, I am getting up....but we need to find a better solution in the future.  We have spent way too many late nights trying to win these auctions.</span></p>
<p><span>Ah, Brad and Chad's dilemma is a common occurrence. eBay has accrued such a large number of users, that it's nearly impossible to get a steal using their proxy bidding system. In fact, for many, bidding on an item becomes almost an obsession to a point that the buyer will do anything to outbid the next person, including paying a much higher price than they need to pay.</span></p>
<p><span>You see, the proxy bidding system is a great concept and will work on some things.  But in order to get the best price for an auction, you really need to wait until the final few seconds of an auction to place your bid.  Or find auctions that are ending in the wee hours of the night. The problem is, you need to be sitting in front of your computer at that moment in order to do this. </span></p>
<p><span>Who has the time for this? With work, meetings, soccer practice, sleep and good old family time, most of us basically have a window between 8pm and 11pm to shop on eBay.  Unfortunately, those are the worst times to bid.  I used to buy/sell electronics on eBay, and over the course of time I realized I would sell my products for much higher prices if I ended the auctions at 11pm eastern on Tuesday nights.  Why? Because I get East Coast and West Coast buyers at home during their only moments to bid on products that they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Mobile eBay Sniping App</strong></span></p>
<p><span>What is eBay sniping? Good question.  Sniping allows an eBay buyer to use a third party application to place a bid for them typically in the final 5 seconds of an auction, thereby giving other bidders virtually no time to increase their bid.  It also avoids the possibility of getting into a bidding war with other bidders and paying more than needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Other advantages include:<br/>   * Not having to sit at your computer when the auction is ending<br/>   * More reliability because the third party has a faster internet connection<br/>   * Ability to bid on auctions at odd times of the day<br/>   * Generally resulting in paying less for an item</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Winning Bid!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Winning Bid will be the premier eBay auction sniping mobile application out there. Built with a highly intuitive graphical interface for the iPhone, iPod and iPad along with a dedicated back-end web system. Users will manage all of their sniping activity directly from their IOS device. The application will then communicate with our web servers to store the sniping information.  When the auction is coming to a close, our technology will automatically place a bid for the item.  Push notifications will then be used in the app itself to notify the user if the snipe was successful or not.</span></p>
<p><span>The application will appeal to a large audience of eBayers, from those that purchase a couple times a year right through to those that are purchasing 10s if not 100s of items per month. The Winning Bid, will be the winning solution when it comes to your eBay buying needs.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What will the funds be used for?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>At this point we have raised the funds for the backend database and some of the funds for the application itself.  The funds raised here will strictly go towards the creation of the iPhone/iPad application.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Real Life Stories</strong></h2>
<p>Chris bought a new 3D LCD TV after saving money for many months and was very happy. A year down the track there was some quality issues with the new TV. He knew this problem would be covered by warranty. He started looking for the receipt, found it but it had faded. He went back to the store but they couldn't find this item in their system. Without an invoice they refused to do anything....he had to buy a new TV for $900.</p>
<p>Irina went to shopping and found a great shoe shop. She liked quite a few, so she bought a few with an option to return in 15 days. After 10 days when she thought of returning the extra pair of shoes to get a refund of $150 ..... but she could not find the invoice.</p>
<p>Samantha and John had built their home with lot of effort and hard earned money. One day there was a burglary in their house and lot of valuables were stolen. They had content insurance but got a massive shock when the insurer asked for invoice or photo of the items stolen. They could not find most.... and lost more than $4k even after getting $10k from insurance.</p>
<p>On hearing of the above incidents, I started thinking, what do we do with receipts and invoices?</p>
<p>I have done different things:</p>
<p>- filed them but found the receipt was faded</p>
<p>- thrown them away and regretted later when I needed</p>
<p>- put them in a safe place and quite often didn't find it afterwards</p>
<p>- taken photos and stored in Google docs and Dropbox, but could not find it in the maze of different stuff stored</p>
These solutions worked sometimes but non of them are perfect, simple and easy. <br/><h2><strong>A Simple and Secure Solution - CHAMBU</strong></h2>
<p>This is when the concept of CHAMBU was thought of.  Chambu is a simple and smart application, which takes the guesswork out of finding your invoice or warranty when you really need it.</p>
<h3>Saving you dollars, time and effort:</h3>
<p>Chambu is accessible 24/7. It is easy and reduces hassles at critical times as you don’t have to search through piles of paper. And importantly, it saves you money by finding those critical bits of paper and photos when you need it.</p>
<p>It works in 3 easy steps:</p>
<p><strong>Click-</strong> Use your mobile to simply take a photo of your warranty or invoice immediately after your latest purchase before it gets lost or thrown away</p>
<p><strong>Record-</strong> Using our simple mobile app upload the photo with the relevant information and we’ll safely store it on our cloud server</p>
<p><strong>Retrieve-</strong> Instantly retrieve the details when required and download the copy of invoice to be printed or shared directly</p>
<h3>Prototype Available</h3>
<p>We have built the prototype version for Apple and Android. You may download this app to view, use and provide us feedback.</p>

<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
<p>I am Sid. I am passionate about innovative and new ideas which address people's real need. I have helped people with their ideas in converting models from concept to reality. However, whenever I pursue something or help someone it is always paramount that it addresses some need and makes a real difference to people.</p>
<p>The snippets mentioned above are real stories. These people lost the items, valuables, collectibles or simply a right to return or exchange. For a lack of easy and simple way to store! Some of the losses were irreplaceable, some very hard earned money. I was disappointed on hearing these but I was thinking how can I help them. Why we don't have simple to store and easy to retrieve solution?</p>
<p>When you contribute to CHAMBU, you contribute to benefitting ordinary people, like you and me. You are helping convert a prototype to reality. You are helping create a simple to store and easy to retrieve solution. You are helping create something that makes life easy for people, reduces hassles and benefits them.</p>
<p>We now need to get this app built such that it has all the features, is still simple to use, has cloud backup and quick retrieval. This requires about $12,500.</p>

<h1><b>iCare Connect</b></h1>
<p><b>by HomeActive</b></p>
<p><b>A smart bracelet that anyone can wear
to plan and track their daily health activities.</b></p>
<p>It is a stand alone device that connects
directly to the cellular data network. Data from sensors in the bracelet is
sent to a secure web dashboard. The wearer can monitor their progress, and
family can check in on the status of their loved ones. </p>
<p>A new and essential connection between
people aging in home and their caregivers.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>How it works and why.</b></h1>
<p><b>Input a simple plan</b> on a web dashboard, based on your personal situation.
Select from a menu of items related to common chronic health conditions. Simple
events – like getting out of the bed in the morning, taking medications, and
measuring vital signs. </p>
<p><b>Sensors </b>on the bracelet track the detailed spatial and temporal vectors of the
bracelet. Motion estimation algorithms detect planned events like eating or
taking pills, around the scheduled time. </p>
<p><b>Messages</b> are displayed for quick single button confirmation on the bracelet.
Medication? Yes. Caregivers can message directly to the bracelet. You OK? Yes.</p>
<p><b>When vital sign measurements</b> are taken from a bluetooth enabled device, like a
glucometer, blood pressure cuff, or weight scale, the bracelet automatically
collects the data and reports it to the dashboard. </p>
<p><b>Advanced dashboard settings</b> let caregivers set thresholds for alerts, based on vital
signs or detection of negative events like a fall, or period of inactivity.
Alerts are sent to the bracelet and the caregiver.</p>
<p><b>Caregivers can participate</b> in the daily routine of their loved ones aging in home
with a chronic health condition, when they are not able to be physically
present.</p>
<h1><b>It is probably for you, or someone you know. </b></h1>
<p><b>Half the adults </b>in the US have a chronic condition. 50 million of us
provide care to a loved one. Chances are you know someone or have heard a story
of something missed and an avoidable event. We can solve this through
technology.</p>
<p><b>It can happen now.</b></p>
<p><b>Extend care into the home.</b> It’s a gap in the system. Together we can make this
happen, now. If everyone that sees it backs it, innovation will emerge from
this crowd source.</p>
<p><b>Deliver a new tool</b> for people to take control of their health and the health
of their loved ones. Our first product delivers the essentials. The analytics
architecture we are building in the cloud will someday predict events in
advance. So we can react even sooner.</p>
<h1><b>Rewards for our contributors.</b></h1>
<p><b>The Promise Band.</b> Comes in two colors, stretchy rubber. Pick one or get
the pair. Its a proxy for the real connection the product will provide and a
nice expression.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/62313/files/20130909050108-TwoBands.png?1378728068"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>Our Status.</b></h1>
<p><b>This is our hardware prototype. </b>It has a machine-to-machine (M2M) module development
board, an ultra low power bluetooth processor with sensors development board,
an oled development breakout board, a serial protocol generator and protocol
analyzer, to name a few. Dr. Hartung is a little freaked out, but we decided to
show it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/38874/files/20130828102658-ks-final-protoboards.jpg?1377710818"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most of these components will be integrated
into a single custom printed circuit board about an inch long. We have a close
design specification, we know where everything goes. Dr. Hartung is uniquely
familiar and experienced with this step. It is a challenging process, and hard
to replicate, thus the picture. The result will be a custom mechanism similar
to our CAD designs and renderings.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Fund the project. </b>Watch it happen. We will post pictures along the way.</p>
<h1><b>Project Plan</b></h1>
<p>We have a clear end goal for our
project - produce the perfect prototype of the iCare Connect bracelet. No small
task. We break it down into two big steps.</p>
<h2><b>$75,000 Goal: PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE </b></h2>
<p><b>Make the form factor perfect. </b>Measure twice. Cut once. We are 3D printing versions of
the bracelet mechanism and band designs. Tweaking little things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>mechanism curvature</li>
<li>anatomical conformity</li>
<li>simple durable clasp</li>
<li>button tactile response</li>
<li>water resistance</li>
<li>materials selection</li>
</ul>
<p>Little things that make a big
difference in aesthetics, comfort, usability and overall appeal. </p>
<h2><b>$150,000 Stretch Goal: ELECTRONIC PROTOTYPE</b></h2>
<p><b>Integrate the components. </b>This is innovative hardware design. Making everything fit
into the lightest, thinnest full featured device on the market. Elements of
this stage include:</p>
<ul>
<li>design and print custom circuit board</li>
<li>alignment, balance, center of mass</li>
<li>hardening for durability</li>
<li>display luminance</li>
<li>haptic motor vibration</li>
</ul>
<p>For seamless functionality, simple
navigation and a stand alone device in a package smaller than anything on the market.</p>

If we
can meet our stretch goal, we can pursue the projects in parallel and the
product gets to market faster.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/38880/files/20130828103011-ks-final-projectplan.png?1377711011"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>And then what ?</b></h1>
<p>Before we go commercial, we have some
work to do.</p>
<p><b>Software development.</b> Perfect prototypes need perfect software. Our feature
set is well defined and we understand the scope and resources required to
deliver on the specification. We have built enterprise class software many
times, for many products.</p>
<p><b>Run it by the pros. </b>We are partnering with a nursing organization affiliated
with a top 20 hospital to run trials to test usability and effectiveness in
improving patient adherence to planned activities and caregiver intervention;
and a F500 pharmacy chain to trial with a portion of their customers.</p>
<p><b>Get the right approvals. </b>It's not a medical device, its a consumer communication
tool. The data must be safe. No problem, we know encryption. We've been through
FCC and CE before.</p>
<p><b>Offer it to you. </b>You backed it. Thank you. </p>
<h1><b>And then...</b></h1>
<p><b>Change the world for the better. </b>We are doing this for a lot of reasons. Personal,
business and to solve a big problem. </p>
<p><b>Solve the care gap.</b> Cover the 'last mile' of largely ignored or unaffordable
extension of remote monitoring into the home. </p>
<p><b>Move forward</b>, and we have big plans. Think predictive diagnostics - as a cloud service
- where you get a heads up that something may happen before it happens. So you
can react and stay healthy. </p>
<p><b>Create a new future</b> of remote sensors and cloud analytics. And health care.
We think it can start here.</p>

by HomeActive
A smart bracelet that anyone can wear
to plan and track their daily health activities.
It is a stand alone device that connects
directly to the cellular data network. Data from sensors in the bracelet is
sent to a secure web dashboard. The wearer can monitor their progress, and
family can check in on the status of their loved ones. 
A new and essential connection between
people aging in home and their caregivers.


How it works and why.
Input a simple plan on a web dashboard, based on your personal situation.
Select from a menu of items related to common chronic health conditions. Simple
events – like getting out of the bed in the morning, taking medications, and
measuring vital signs. 
Sensors on the bracelet track the detailed spatial and temporal vectors of the
bracelet. Motion estimation algorithms detect planned events like eating or
taking pills, around the scheduled time. 
Messages are displayed for quick single button confirmation on the bracelet.
Medication? Yes. Caregivers can message directly to the bracelet. You OK? Yes.
When vital sign measurements are taken from a bluetooth enabled device, like a
glucometer, blood pressure cuff, or weight scale, the bracelet automatically
collects the data and reports it to the dashboard. 
Advanced dashboard settings let caregivers set thresholds for alerts, based on vital
signs or detection of negative events like a fall, or period of inactivity.
Alerts are sent to the bracelet and the caregiver.
Caregivers can participate in the daily routine of their loved ones aging in home
with a chronic health condition, when they are not able to be physically
present.
It is probably for you, or someone you know. 
Half the adults in the US have a chronic condition. 50 million of us
provide care to a loved one. Chances are you know someone or have heard a story
of something missed and an avoidable event. We can solve this through
technology.
It can happen now.
Extend care into the home. It’s a gap in the system. Together we can make this
happen, now. If everyone that sees it backs it, innovation will emerge from
this crowd source.
Deliver a new tool for people to take control of their health and the health
of their loved ones. Our first product delivers the essentials. The analytics
architecture we are building in the cloud will someday predict events in
advance. So we can react even sooner.
Rewards for our contributors.
The Promise Band. Comes in two colors, stretchy rubber. Pick one or get
the pair. Its a proxy for the real connection the product will provide and a
nice expression.

 

Our Status.
This is our hardware prototype. It has a machine-to-machine (M2M) module development
board, an ultra low power bluetooth processor with sensors development board,
an oled development breakout board, a serial protocol generator and protocol
analyzer, to name a few. Dr. Hartung is a little freaked out, but we decided to
show it.

Most of these components will be integrated
into a single custom printed circuit board about an inch long. We have a close
design specification, we know where everything goes. Dr. Hartung is uniquely
familiar and experienced with this step. It is a challenging process, and hard
to replicate, thus the picture. The result will be a custom mechanism similar
to our CAD designs and renderings.







Fund the project. Watch it happen. We will post pictures along the way.
Project Plan
We have a clear end goal for our
project - produce the perfect prototype of the iCare Connect bracelet. No small
task. We break it down into two big steps.
$75,000 Goal: PHYSICAL PROTOTYPE 
Make the form factor perfect. Measure twice. Cut once. We are 3D printing versions of
the bracelet mechanism and band designs. Tweaking little things like:

mechanism curvature
anatomical conformity
simple durable clasp
button tactile response
water resistance
materials selection

Little things that make a big
difference in aesthetics, comfort, usability and overall appeal. 
$150,000 Stretch Goal: ELECTRONIC PROTOTYPE
Integrate the components. This is innovative hardware design. Making everything fit
into the lightest, thinnest full featured device on the market. Elements of
this stage include:

design and print custom circuit board
alignment, balance, center of mass
hardening for durability
display luminance
haptic motor vibration

For seamless functionality, simple
navigation and a stand alone device in a package smaller than anything on the market.

If we
can meet our stretch goal, we can pursue the projects in parallel and the
product gets to market faster.




And then what ?
Before we go commercial, we have some
work to do.
Software development. Perfect prototypes need perfect software. Our feature
set is well defined and we understand the scope and resources required to
deliver on the specification. We have built enterprise class software many
times, for many products.
Run it by the pros. We are partnering with a nursing organization affiliated
with a top 20 hospital to run trials to test usability and effectiveness in
improving patient adherence to planned activities and caregiver intervention;
and a F500 pharmacy chain to trial with a portion of their customers.
Get the right approvals. It's not a medical device, its a consumer communication
tool. The data must be safe. No problem, we know encryption. We've been through
FCC and CE before.
Offer it to you. You backed it. Thank you. 
And then...
Change the world for the better. We are doing this for a lot of reasons. Personal,
business and to solve a big problem. 
Solve the care gap. Cover the 'last mile' of largely ignored or unaffordable
extension of remote monitoring into the home. 
Move forward, and we have big plans. Think predictive diagnostics - as a cloud service
- where you get a heads up that something may happen before it happens. So you
can react and stay healthy. 
Create a new future of remote sensors and cloud analytics. And health care.
We think it can start here.

<h3>What is Our Bookshelf?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Our Bookshelf is a social network where people can share their ebooks as easily as they can share print books. At the moment, most copyrighted ebooks don't allow you to share them. This is because when you buy an ebook you don't own the book the way you own a print book. You own a license to read it on certain devices and most of these licenses prohibit sharing. We plan to create a new license that does allow sharing, but in a way that treats authors and publishers fairly. This is a huge undertaking that your contribution will help make possible. We will start by creating a social network for sharing public domain ebooks<strong>. </strong></span>These ebooks are not copyrighted so users can share them freely. A lot of great books are in the public domain, including most classics. True you can find some of them elsewhere, but learning about them through your friends can introduce you to books you might not have known about or overlooked. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: #000000;"">Once the site is up and running, we will reach out to authors and publishers to adopt our new licenses that will allow sharing of copyrighted works through our site. Once an author has made an agreement with </span>Our Bookshelf, users may upload copyrighted ebooks by that author onto their virtual bookshelf to share with their friends. Because these files will have no DRM (digital rights management), a user can get a copy of an ebook from a friend and hold onto it for as long as it takes them to finish the book. Although this means users will give non-DRM copies of their ebooks to friends, Our Bookshelf will do 3 things that will prevent copies from multiplying and spreading to the point they become a problem for copyright holders.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><ol>
<li>Users can only borrow and lend ebooks with friends in their network. This prevents users from giving a copy of an ebook away to everyone who has an internet connection (the way most file sharing methods do).</li>
<li>A user may not borrow a book from a friend’s virtual bookshelf and then place it on their own virtual bookshelf. This will prevent people who did not purchase the ebook, and therefore do not have the right to share it, from making it available to others on Our Bookshelf.</li>
<li>When someone checks out an ebook from your virtual bookshelf nobody can check out that ebook from your bookshelf for 3 weeks. This will prevent one person from giving an ebook to everyone in their network at once. Copyright holders will appreciate this consideration for new releases and popular titles.</li>

<h1>
<br/>What makes this outlet different from what's out in the market now?</h1>
<p><strong>Simply put, it's Blue Ocean Technology because there is nothing that compares...no phantom power is being generated when the doors of the USB Chargers are closed.  The SMART Technology samples the rechargeable device and only gives the appropriate amount of power, preventing overheating of the battery.  When the Plugin Outlet senses the battery is fully charged, it turns off the USB Charger automatically, while using a sliver of power to monitor the device (.04 amp).  There is no need to babysit your device(s).  The cost savings from phantom electricity and replacement batteries will pay for the Plugin Outlet with regular use.  The two LED lights display the USB Chargers are powering the device(s).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unique faceplate design to charge 4 electrical devices, even two standard chargers in the AC plugs and two USB cables in our SMART Technology USB Chargers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The USB Sock-IT Plugin Outlet 1/4"" lip completely covers the existing faceplate.</strong></p>

<h1>What colors will be available?</h1>
<p><strong>White, Black, Brown and Almond.</strong></p>
<h1>How can we customize the cover design of our outlet?</h1>
<p><br/><strong>We have two concepts of custom designs for the outlet.  One is to use a vinyl graphic molded sticker that will come in two pieces, one for the cover and one for the circular faceplate in the middle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The other concept is to offer plastic covers with the designs already imprinted into the plastic and a circular molded vinyl sticker for the faceplate.  We are open to suggestions from our backers and will render a decision once mass production has begun.  The custom covers will be sold as a separate item.  </strong></p>
<h1>What will the USB Sock-IT Plugin Outlet retail for?</h1>

<h1>Where do you manufacture the Outlet?</h1>
<p><strong>We have contracted manufacturing with a privately owned factory in Zhongzhan, a city in southern China near Hong Kong.  Our plan with 8G Electronics in the long term is to bring our company's manufacturing back to the U.S., which includes Engineering/Circuit Board Production/Injection Molding/Test and Evaluation/Assembly and Packaging.  </strong></p>

<p></p><p></p></div>","Hi Again!
We want to introduce the iCamera KEEP, the next great DIY home automation and security solution from iSmartAlarm.  We've taken some of the best ideas of security cameras and video monitoring and made one clean, awesome package.  
1280 x 720 HD Resolution?  Yes.
350°x40° Pan and Tilt?  Oh yeah.
FREE cloud video recording and storage?  Wow.
Real-Time On-Demand Streaming Video?  Certainly.
Night Vision?  Absolutely.
Motion Sensor?  You got it.
Audio Sensor?  Definitely.  
Can I use it by itself?  Yes, up to four!
Can I use it with my iSmartAlarm?  Yes, for even more comprehensive security.
No monthly fees, no contracts!  Whoa - Of course not!




The iCamera KEEP works on your home's existing Wi-Fi network, or as part of the iSmartAlarm Home Security System.  Add up to four to any network, and take advantage of the free iSmartAlarm App to view, manage, and control your home from anywhere in the world.  Know when glass is broken or there is movement in your home INSTANTLY.  See what is going on, and call the authorities.  You have proof - the iCamera KEEP begins recording as soon as motion is sensed, and stores 10 second video clips for you for free.  In the future, we'll be adding local and remote cloud storage for video as well.



Ah, the name - We knew we wanted to retain the ""iCamera"" name.  But how do we differentiate it from the original, first generation iCamera?  iCamera Pro?  It's definitely a huge step forward. iCamera HAL 9000?  A bit creepy.  iCamera HD?  It certainly is HD, but that's boring.  iCamera Plus?  No, that's silly.  After weeks of discussion, whiteboards full of names/acronyms/gibberish, and asking our fans and customers for their ideas, we decided on The iCamera KEEP.  

Keep: Verb (used with object)
To hold or retain in one's possession; hold as one's own.
Keep: Noun (object)
The innermost and strongest structure or central tower of a medieval castle. 
Well, that fits pretty perfectly, don't you think?
Once you setup the iCamera KEEP, either as a part of the iSmartAlarm or on its own, you can move it anywhere in your house.  No wiring is required - All it needs is a power source (a standard wall-outlet), and you're all set!The iSmartAlarm gives you complete, easy control.  View multiple iCameras at once, or choose just one to view in full screen and landscape. Follow activity throughout the house with a wide range of pan and tilt controls.

Users (up to 12) will receive text, phone call, email, and push notifications on their smartphones in case of emergency or by user-defined conditions.  You can edit and customize your iCamera KEEP network - change the motion and audio sensor sensitivities, change night vision strength, create delays between the automated snapshots, and more!




To be honest, we had such a fantastic time when we launched our iSmartAlarm Home Security System on Indiegogo in January 2013, we wanted to do it again!  Indiegogo gives us a great place to reach out to our original contributors, and to also find new customers and fans that will like our iCamera KEEP as well as our iSmartAlarm system. 
Contributing now, during our Pre-sale campaign on Indiegogo, can save you over $100!

Already have an iSmartAlarm system?  Add one or more iCamera KEEP!  You can add 4 additional iCamera KEEPs, so if you already have the original iCamera, you'll have 5 streaming video cameras at your beck and call!






iSmart Alarm, Inc. was founded in Silicon Valley in 2012 on the principles of safety, beauty, and intelligence.  Inspired by break-ins in the area of unoccupied or under-construction homes (including Steve Jobs' family home), and of rental homes that simply could not afford or wire their homes with ADT or similar systems, we focused on design and developing the best expandable smartphone-enabled home security and home control system.  The iSmartAlarm puts a 21st century spin on traditional security systems. The sleek, sophisticated system utilizes iOS and Android devices to put home security and home control in the palm of its users’ hands. Our products are cool, really easy to use, and affordable to everyone.  iSmartAlarm protects your home intelligently.Oh, we've been very very busy in the last year!

They hybrid driver system utilizes a crossover communication process to tell both drivers not only what sound to produce but what sound not to produce. When paired together, the drivers can focus both on their strengths and not worry about their weaknesses. 
 Ironically, all the products mentioned by customers claim sweat and water resistance. Every single internal part of 26 has been coated in our proprietary hydrophobic solution. We’ve taken every precaution to ensure our earbuds will perform under the toughest conditions. Others claim to be waterproof, but we can back it up.Nobody has figured out how to create a secure and comfortable fit without some obtrusive ear hook, uncomfortable wing, or bulky neck-mounted collar. We might as well wrap your earbuds in duct tape and strap them to your ears - equally as comfortable and effective.     High intensity fitness locks use the natural curves of your ears to lock the earbuds in place without an ugly hook or neck collar.  In other words, the wide variety locks and wings can create 144 unique combinations, allowing you to achieve the perfect custom fit for your ears. 
Who wants to be tethered to a charging brick, or USB cord just to make sure you have enough juice to make it through your workout? Additional batteries that magnetically clip onto 26 give you the extra juice when they need it most. This way you get 15 hours of play/talk time and over 400 hours of standby time.  Our microphone is specifically tuned to pick up the human voice and filter out ambient background noise, ensuring that your voice is crisp and clear in any environment.  
Plain and simple, most wireless earbuds are not attractive. The stability mechanisms make it difficult to wear outside the gym. The designs continue to miss the mark in being versatile enough to wear throughout your entire daily routine. They sacrifice fashion for function and vice versa. At every turn we worked with fashion bloggers to make sure that 26 exudes the transcending class with which you live and be the perfect accessory for your journey.  Whether you’re on the road, at home, in the gym, or at the office, music is the catalyst that inspires us to take that step and reach the next level. Fuel your journey with music and ignite your passion.   Get Cash Back on the Projects You Love!   Bluetooth Specifications: Version 4.0, Class 2Frequency Response: 19hz - 20khzIn-Line Stabilizers: Dimensions: 41.3mm x 17.5mm x 10mmIn-Line Stabilizers Weight: 10.73 grams (Total Combined Weight)Mobile Charging Clip: Dimensions: 41.1mm x 17.5 x 12mm (Includes positioning walls)Mobile Charging Clip Weight: 7.76 gramsBattery Capacity:

<p>Would you pay more than $1,000 to remotely communicate with another computer? The blind have to. Please help us change this!</p>
<p>Despite the proliferation of smarter technology in our homes and at our jobs, the American Foundation for the Blind reports more than 70% of the blind community in the United States is still unemployed. The problem is compounded by special software priced well into the thousands to do computer tasks everyone else takes for granted. NVDA Remote Access does its part to reverse this trend by creating more job opportunities for tech entrepreneurs, system administrators, rehabilitation specialists, and educators.</p>
<h2 id="""">What Is Distance Accessibility?</h2>
<p>Blind people use screen readers to access information displayed graphically on a computer, tablet or mobile phone. The screen reader employs a variety of heuristics to convert the visual information into text that is rendered in speech via a synthesizer. NVDA Remote Access builds on the open source screen reader NVDA, allowing a blind person to send commands to and hear the speech from another user's computer. This provides an ideal tool for real time communication between workstations and opens doors for a variety of previously-inaccessible job tasks.</p>
<h2 id="""">Why NVDA Remote Access?</h2>
<p>There are two popular screen readers for the Windows environment, NVDA and JAWS. NVDA is free software and can be employed anywhere by blind people, their educators, their employers and anyone else who needs non-visual access to a Windows based PC. JAWS is commercial software that sells for $1,095 per copy, placing it well beyond the reach for most individual users and increasing the cost of employing or educating a blind person. The irony? The publishers charge $200 more to enable the software's remote access feature. Would you pay over a thousand dollars to remotely interact with another computer?</p>
<h2 id="""">The NVDA Remote Access Advantage</h2>
<p>NVDA Remote provides a feature set unmatched by its competitors and does so totally free for the end user.</p>
<p>Advantages to using NVDA Remote Access include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emphasis on ease of use and thorough documentation for the novice and expert user alike</li>
<li>Compatible with remote desktop connection, VNC, Team viewer, PC over IP, PC anywhere, remote assistance, SCCM remote control tool, among other protocols</li>
<li>Ability to run from a thumb drive, eliminating the need to install a screen reader</li>
<li>Reliant on state-of-the-art encryption for maximum security and privacy.</li>
<li>Configurable automatic connection to a remote system for any time access to a remote computer.</li>
<li>Connection to a remote PC using a relay server, ensuring functionality across different types of networks such as when the end-user cannot open ports</li>
<li>Free Libre, and Open Source Software (FLOSS)</li>
<li>Available on GitHub for collaborative expansion of the source code</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="""">Exciting Possibilities Created By NVDA Remote Access</h2>
<p>NVDA Remote Access will give blind users the freedom to enjoy a number of career and educational options. Blind Technical Support Professionals and amateurs alike can Use NVDA Remote access to connect to their clients computers remotely in real time and walk them through multi-step procedures or teach them new applications, techniques and workflows. Educators can hear what their students are doing on their computers and vice versa, providing a perfect environment for hands-on training from afar. Whether in an office down the hall or a datacenter on the other side of the globe, NVDA Remote access will provide powerful, minimal latency access to the Windows desktop via speech.</p>
<h2 id="""">Why You Should Contribute To This Project</h2>
<p>Blind people are passionate about moving from beneficiaries to contributors. Unfortunately their forward momentum is often inhibited by software that is as cost-prohibitive as it is difficult to navigate. NVDA Remote Access is built on a platform designed for maximum efficiency with minimal prerequisite training.</p>
<p>The $10,000 funding goal will be invested directly into the research, development and maintenance of the product. The software design is specialized enough to require experienced software engineers to create and launch the software, and while a relatively low cost professional Windows programmer costs in excess of $75 per hour, Tyler Spivey and Christopher Toth, owners of [GetAccessibleApps] and founding members of [3 Mouse Technology,] agreed to make this contribution to the blindness community for a fraction of their traditional development cost.</p>
<p>With NVDA Remote Access in hand, blind computer users will capitalize on the results of your investment without the undue burden of spending exorbitant amounts per copy to perform the same computer tasks sighted colleagues perform out of the box. NVDA Remote Access will be another step forward in improving employment, educational and lifestyle opportunities for this traditionally underserved community.</p></div>","NVDA Remote Access

SafeBand Safe Tag battery (CR2032) will last anywhere from 6 to 9 months, after which it can be easily replaced.   </p><p><b>What is the radius of SafeBand's signal?   </b></p><p>SafeBand employs Bluetooth Smart technology, so it's radius is from 5 to 50 meters depending on environment (thick walls, crowded rooms). Safe Tag uses the same principles and technology as the bracelet, so it's radius is the same.   </p><p><b>How protected are SafeBand and Safe Tag?   </b></p><p>SafeBand is water-resistant up to IP67 standard. It means that the bracelet is protected from long-term water exposure. Bear in mind, however, that the leather strap is not waterproof and may be damaged.  In case of Safe Tag getting wet, we recommend to remove the battery, let the device dry out, and turn it back on. The electronics inside Safe Tag will be water- and short circuit-protected.   </p><p><b>How does SafeBand switch between the ‘home’, ‘office’ and ‘street’ modes?   </b></p><p>SafeBand combines three methods - it uses GPS and WiFi on your smartphone and a stationary Safe Tag (if you choose to use a tag for this purpose) to identify your location. Once you’ve set it up via application, SafeBand will recognize when you’re at home, and not send alarms if you leave tagged objects in one room and move to another. However, once you leave your house and you’re outside, SafeBand switches to street mode and keeps track of your valuables more closely, to alarm you to any potential loss. You can also choose to set any of these modes manually.   </p><p><b>Will SafeBand give false alarms for theft or loss of devices?   </b></p><p>Safety is SafeBand's main priority, so while we worked hard to minimize the false alarms, we chose to not compromise the reliability. However, the user is free to set the range for SafeBand alarm, and change it depending on the environment.   </p><p><b>How do I use Safe Tags? How do they protect my things?   </b></p><p>Safe Tag can be used as a sticker and pendant, you choose how to attach it to the objects. The Safe Tag keeps track of the tagged object’s movement and acceleration, so if the object starts moving (e.g., falls or is stolen), it will start buzzing, and the bracelet will vibrate.

Click Here to Learn About Our Rewards Program - Share and Get Money Back!What is the battery life for SafeBand and Safe Tags?   The SafeBand battery will last from 7 to 30 days and depends on the intensity of use and quantity of Safe Tags connected. SafeBand Safe Tag battery (CR2032) will last anywhere from 6 to 9 months, after which it can be easily replaced.   What is the radius of SafeBand's signal?   SafeBand employs Bluetooth Smart technology, so it's radius is from 5 to 50 meters depending on environment (thick walls, crowded rooms). Safe Tag uses the same principles and technology as the bracelet, so it's radius is the same.   How protected are SafeBand and Safe Tag?   SafeBand is water-resistant up to IP67 standard. It means that the bracelet is protected from long-term water exposure. Bear in mind, however, that the leather strap is not waterproof and may be damaged.  In case of Safe Tag getting wet, we recommend to remove the battery, let the device dry out, and turn it back on. The electronics inside Safe Tag will be water- and short circuit-protected.   How does SafeBand switch between the ‘home’, ‘office’ and ‘street’ modes?   SafeBand combines three methods - it uses GPS and WiFi on your smartphone and a stationary Safe Tag (if you choose to use a tag for this purpose) to identify your location. Once you’ve set it up via application, SafeBand will recognize when you’re at home, and not send alarms if you leave tagged objects in one room and move to another. However, once you leave your house and you’re outside, SafeBand switches to street mode and keeps track of your valuables more closely, to alarm you to any potential loss. You can also choose to set any of these modes manually.   Will SafeBand give false alarms for theft or loss of devices?   Safety is SafeBand's main priority, so while we worked hard to minimize the false alarms, we chose to not compromise the reliability. However, the user is free to set the range for SafeBand alarm, and change it depending on the environment.   How do I use Safe Tags? How do they protect my things?   Safe Tag can be used as a sticker and pendant, you choose how to attach it to the objects. The Safe Tag keeps track of the tagged object’s movement and acceleration, so if the object starts moving (e.g., falls or is stolen), it will start buzzing, and the bracelet will vibrate. Same when the tagged object leaves the bracelet range (e.g., you forget something on your desk). Is wearing SafeBand every day harmful to my health?   No. Bluetooth Low Energy is completely safe. You can wear SafeBand daily, you can sleep with SafeBand on. If I lose my SafeBand, can anyone access all the passwords stored on it?   No. Your SafeBand will be connected to the application and will require authorization; nobody can use your band, or gain access to the information stored on it without this authorization. The bracelet is a personal identifier, not a password storage, so stealing the bracelet doesn't mean access to your access keys.   What if I forget online account password?   You can restore it with your email address.   Can I do all the set up for SafeBand myself?  It’s very simple. You will not need do more than charge your bracelet, download an application and follow a few easy steps. All the settings are ready in default mode for you to start using the bracelet from the box. If you want to learn all the tricks, however, we will also provide you with a manual. What if my bracelet is out of charge? Will the Safe Tags still work?   Yes. You can operate your Safe Tags through your smartphone. But don’t worry - you can also charge your SafeBand from any USB port using enclosed charging cable.   So when do I get it?   We estimate the delivery at November, 2015 in the US. Shipments in the US are free. However, if you require international shipment, it will cost about $15 additionally and may take longer. It depends on the local delivery particulars.SafeBand employs patent pending technology.",13.0,1,"19 Campaigns

<p>We are Protek Innovations and we make products that limit exposure to cell phone radiation. My partners and I all met in college at UCLA, where several of us studied electrical engineering. As we were graduating from college, cell phones had permeated the scene. Everyone we knew was growing increasingly more attached to these gadgets. </p>
<p>During my younger years, my father and his partners always carried around cell phones and pagers because they were on call as emergency room physicians. As a child, those massive devices with their huge antennas made my father and his friends look like astronauts calling the moon. I could never understand how those phones could work without “roasting” the user. </p>
<p>One day, my father came home with the terrible news that his close friend and business partner, Mickey, discovered a tumor behind his ear as he was combing his hair and needed immediate surgery. A few days later my father attended Mickey's funeral. Since then, we have wondered about cell phone radiation and its potentially harmful side effects. </p>
<p>For those of us left mourning Mickey’s sudden death, we found it very odd that Mickey developed a brain tumor so quickly. Over the years, as more and more friends were stricken with powerful and rapidly spreading cancers, I began to reflect on how precious life is, and how quickly it can be taken away. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>It may sound silly, but ProTek was literally started to Prot-e-k people from consumer technology. The team members are seasoned developers, inventors and engineers having invented some of the coolest accessories in consumer electronics, some of which I am sure you can recall for their ingeniousness and cleverness. </p>
<p>After a long weekend in Sedona Arizona, where we met people who were immersed in alternative healing, and learned the healing power of crystals, meditation and energy, our mission became clear and we set out to build our first product, WaveBlocker. </p>
<p>The first prototype started with shielding materials we sourced from around the world and thankfully one of our team members, who was very knowledgeable in RF helped us engineer a solution that we believe is so elegant it has to be seen to be believed. </p>
<p>We created WaveBlocker for those like us, who are skeptical and do not like making a call with our handset placed against our head. When we did the research we found that there were many large organizations funded by cell phone companies trying to keep news about cell phone radiation quiet. </p>
<p>Based on our research, we have discovered that there is something known as SAR, or Specific Absorption Ratio, which is basically a guideline for device manufacturers regarding how much radiation their device can generate while being deemed safe. </p>
<p>We have seen experiments showing seedlings exposed to radiation and what happens. We all know how red, hot, and sometimes even sweaty our ears get when we are on long calls. SAR is different for all models of phones but one thing all manufacturers agree on is that operate cell phones safely, should not come in direct contact the body, meaning they should not be held up to your head. </p>
<p>Initially, we were skeptical. How could this be real? We continued researching and discovered in the fine print, under the RF exposure tab on Apple’s website, it clearly indicates how much distance a user must keep between themselves and their device to be SAR complaint. We further discovered it is recommended that a user maintain a .5mm distance between themselves and their phone, something that most people do not do. </p>
<p>All of us at Protek wondered what all of this cumulative exposure to what is known in the scientific community as non-ionizing radiation is doing to us little by little each day. </p>
<p>WaveBlocker is designed as a passive circuit, meaning it has not power source such as a battery. Wave blocker converts the cell phone radiation your cell phone ordinarily gives off into electricity and then harmless light energy by turning on a little LED light. WaveBlocker lets our customers know it is “Proteking” them with an LED light that flutters on and off. </p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/207212146?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>WaveBlocker is significant because it simply reduces the cumulative exposure to cell phone radiation we expose ourselves every day. When you see WaveBlocker’s red LED flutter you can be sure our patented circuit is converting the cell phone radiation your phone ordinarily emits into electricity and then into harmless light. </p>
</div>
<p>Our backers and supporters will help us iterate our technology into a cell phone case for a multitude of different devices. Our circuitry was carefully designed by an experienced team and has been tested in a lab and shown to significantly reduce exposure. Our dream is to incorporate this technology into the device one day and enter into licensing deals with the manufactures to include this safety technology.</p>

<p>This company has survived many years of getting by when times were tough and finances were limited. Somehow, we managed to make 2 highly functional prototypes, a lab certification on performance and patent(s). </p>
<p>This team is a resourceful scrappy bunch and we will not stop until we see millions of cell phone cases with our cell phone radiation mitigation technology embedded. This team has been doing this for several years because we want to be the best at making a technology that can be of service and actually make a difference. Our perseverance is there because we enjoy making things with each other and have built a camaraderie over the years. </p>
<p>With people buying $65M each year in cell phone accessories that simply prolong battery life or protect devices, we see a far more important health concern with selling all these consumers WaveBlocker Smartcases with our technology to reduce exposure. </p>
<p>We see cell phone proliferation as a part of our society that isn’t going away, and usage will only increase. If I am going to continue to have to hold this huge device against my head for another 10 years, I want the peace of mind that goes along with having a WaveBlocker.</p>

<p>We are raising $4000 to manufacture a cell phone case prototype and optimize our design for other cell phone models including Android devices. </p>
<p>Our goal is to have a circuit that functions for all Apple iPhone models and Android devices. Our current prototype functions universally on the majority of mobile devices which have multiple antennas. </p>
<p>During our research, we found that Apple and Samsung devices have multiple antennas located on the top and bottom of each device. In our next iteration of the circuit, we intend to focus on the antennae closest to the users head in order to limit radiation exposure to the head and neck. </p>
<p>Our current design was tested in an independent lab – the same one used by the device manufacturers to test efficacy – and when tested, WaveBlocker reduced exposure by 65%. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511852046/ahfgw3hlczqys2ouo26z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If we do not reach our entire goal we will be delivering the WaveBlocker units we sell and exploring alternative ways to fund the next step which is integrating our circuit design into a cell phone case design. We have identified firms to work with and hope that the crowd fund will help us reach those interested in supporting us by purchasing a WaveBlocker, or one of the other perks. </p>
<p>Our goal is to make products that are made in the USA and priced competitively so everyone can benefit from the technology and we need the IndieGogo communities help us to get there. This is why we are selling our wave blocker units at discounted pricing during this crowd fund.</p>

<p>This project is valuable to the contributor because they will be part of an awareness movement, where transparency reigns. We don’t want the SAR information relegated to the small print. We want manufacturers to inform consumers, and not sell products that are designed to only be safe in certain conditions.

<p>Helping us get a WaveBlocker in the hands of another conscious consumer has a worldly impact because we are all connected today in this globalized world and economy.

My partners and I all met in college at UCLA, where several of us studied electrical engineering. As we were graduating from college, cell phones had permeated the scene. Everyone we knew was growing increasingly more attached to these gadgets. 
During my younger years, my father and his partners always carried around cell phones and pagers because they were on call as emergency room physicians. As a child, those massive devices with their huge antennas made my father and his friends look like astronauts calling the moon. I could never understand how those phones could work without “roasting” the user. 
One day, my father came home with the terrible news that his close friend and business partner, Mickey, discovered a tumor behind his ear as he was combing his hair and needed immediate surgery. A few days later my father attended Mickey's funeral. Since then, we have wondered about cell phone radiation and its potentially harmful side effects. 
For those of us left mourning Mickey’s sudden death, we found it very odd that Mickey developed a brain tumor so quickly. Over the years, as more and more friends were stricken with powerful and rapidly spreading cancers, I began to reflect on how precious life is, and how quickly it can be taken away. 
 

 
It may sound silly, but ProTek was literally started to Prot-e-k people from consumer technology. The team members are seasoned developers, inventors and engineers having invented some of the coolest accessories in consumer electronics, some of which I am sure you can recall for their ingeniousness and cleverness. 
After a long weekend in Sedona Arizona, where we met people who were immersed in alternative healing, and learned the healing power of crystals, meditation and energy, our mission became clear and we set out to build our first product, WaveBlocker. 
The first prototype started with shielding materials we sourced from around the world and thankfully one of our team members, who was very knowledgeable in RF helped us engineer a solution that we believe is so elegant it has to be seen to be believed. 
We created WaveBlocker for those like us, who are skeptical and do not like making a call with our handset placed against our head. When we did the research we found that there were many large organizations funded by cell phone companies trying to keep news about cell phone radiation quiet. 
Based on our research, we have discovered that there is something known as SAR, or Specific Absorption Ratio, which is basically a guideline for device manufacturers regarding how much radiation their device can generate while being deemed safe. 
We have seen experiments showing seedlings exposed to radiation and what happens. We all know how red, hot, and sometimes even sweaty our ears get when we are on long calls. SAR is different for all models of phones but one thing all manufacturers agree on is that operate cell phones safely, should not come in direct contact the body, meaning they should not be held up to your head. 
Initially, we were skeptical. How could this be real? We continued researching and discovered in the fine print, under the RF exposure tab on Apple’s website, it clearly indicates how much distance a user must keep between themselves and their device to be SAR complaint. We further discovered it is recommended that a user maintain a .5mm distance between themselves and their phone, something that most people do not do. 
All of us at Protek wondered what all of this cumulative exposure to what is known in the scientific community as non-ionizing radiation is doing to us little by little each day. 
WaveBlocker is designed as a passive circuit, meaning it has not power source such as a battery. Wave blocker converts the cell phone radiation your cell phone ordinarily gives off into electricity and then harmless light energy by turning on a little LED light. WaveBlocker lets our customers know it is “Proteking” them with an LED light that flutters on and off. 


WaveBlocker is significant because it simply reduces the cumulative exposure to cell phone radiation we expose ourselves every day. When you see WaveBlocker’s red LED flutter you can be sure our patented circuit is converting the cell phone radiation your phone ordinarily emits into electricity and then into harmless light. 

Our backers and supporters will help us iterate our technology into a cell phone case for a multitude of different devices. Our circuitry was carefully designed by an experienced team and has been tested in a lab and shown to significantly reduce exposure. Our dream is to incorporate this technology into the device one day and enter into licensing deals with the manufactures to include this safety technology.

 


 
This company has survived many years of getting by when times were tough and finances were limited. Somehow, we managed to make 2 highly functional prototypes, a lab certification on performance and patent(s). 
This team is a resourceful scrappy bunch and we will not stop until we see millions of cell phone cases with our cell phone radiation mitigation technology embedded. This team has been doing this for several years because we want to be the best at making a technology that can be of service and actually make a difference. Our perseverance is there because we enjoy making things with each other and have built a camaraderie over the years. 
With people buying $65M each year in cell phone accessories that simply prolong battery life or protect devices, we see a far more important health concern with selling all these consumers WaveBlocker Smartcases with our technology to reduce exposure. 
We see cell phone proliferation as a part of our society that isn’t going away, and usage will only increase. If I am going to continue to have to hold this huge device against my head for another 10 years, I want the peace of mind that goes along with having a WaveBlocker.

 

 

 

 
We are raising $4000 to manufacture a cell phone case prototype and optimize our design for other cell phone models including Android devices. 
Our goal is to have a circuit that functions for all Apple iPhone models and Android devices. Our current prototype functions universally on the majority of mobile devices which have multiple antennas. 
During our research, we found that Apple and Samsung devices have multiple antennas located on the top and bottom of each device. In our next iteration of the circuit, we intend to focus on the antennae closest to the users head in order to limit radiation exposure to the head and neck. 
Our current design was tested in an independent lab – the same one used by the device manufacturers to test efficacy – and when tested, WaveBlocker reduced exposure by 65%. 


If we do not reach our entire goal we will be delivering the WaveBlocker units we sell and exploring alternative ways to fund the next step which is integrating our circuit design into a cell phone case design. We have identified firms to work with and hope that the crowd fund will help us reach those interested in supporting us by purchasing a WaveBlocker, or one of the other perks. 
Our goal is to make products that are made in the USA and priced competitively so everyone can benefit from the technology and we need the IndieGogo communities help us to get there. This is why we are selling our wave blocker units at discounted pricing during this crowd fund.

 
 
 



 
 
 
This project is valuable to the contributor because they will be part of an awareness movement, where transparency reigns. We don’t want the SAR information relegated to the small print. We want manufacturers to inform consumers, and not sell products that are designed to only be safe in certain conditions. We all place our devices in our pockets or to our faces and we shouldn’t have to worry about the health risks that can come with such a benign act. 
Helping us get a WaveBlocker in the hands of another conscious consumer has a worldly impact because we are all connected today in this globalized world and economy. It is important that consumers of the world stand for transparency with the companies they support and accept nothing less. Buying a WaveBlocker might not do much in the short term to stop manufacturers from relegating the things they don’t want you to see, but hopefully it will strengthen the community of self-aware consumers who are not afraid to question everything.

<h3>What is Ninja Bodyguard?</h3>
<p>Ninja Bodyguard is a mobile app designed to keep people safe and to provide a discreet way to alert others that something is up.</p>
<p>How can Ninja Bodyguard help you? Suppose:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You get pulled over by the police. Without taking your phone out of your pocket, you trigger the app to start audio recording, just in case.</p></li>
<li><p>You are on a blind date. It isn't going well, so you reach into your purse (without breaking eye contact) and trigger an alert. Seconds later, your friend responds by calling you with the perfect excuse to get out of there.</p></li>
<li><p>You are walking around and you notice that someone is following you. Without looking, you reach into your bag and trigger an alert. Audio recording starts automatically, and within a few seconds a Neighborhood Ninja is calling you to make sure you are ok.</p></li>
<li><p>You are having a conversation, and something about it makes you feel uncomfortable. Without arousing suspicion, you reach into your pocket and start recording audio, which you can use or refer to later.</p></li>
<li><p>You are walking home from your library at night. It takes you 10 minutes to get home, so you set a delayed alert for 15 minutes. If something happens to you on your way home, the timer counts down to zero, triggering a text message and your location to your group. When you get home safely, a single tap disarms and resets the timer.</p></li>

<p>Imagine that a raging wildfire is spreading out of control, beyond management of firefighters, creeping closer to a rural neighborhood. Residents have been instructed to leave and only have time to collect their families, their selves, and a few precious items before fleeing to safety. Neighbors, family, and friends are forced to become onlookers as flames spread through their yards and begin to creep up the walls of their houses. Homes are devoured by flames, leaving behind charred skeletons of the structures they once were, irreplaceable belongings are reduced to ash. Lives are forever devistated and a solution is so clearly needed. What if there was a way to avoid all of this loss and heartache?</p>
<p>Dennis Cortese, an entrepreneuer from Fort Collins, Colorado, has created such a system to prevent the devistation associated with wildfires: FireStop. This inivative system will protect families and individuals from losing all they have when these threats approach mountain and rural areas.</p>
<p>FireStop is an automated fire suppresant system that protects homes from incoming wildfires. A holding tank of FireStop's heat resistant and flame retardent foam is installed anywhere on the building. Its sensors, fixated to the exterior of a home, indicate the threat of an approaching fire automatically. The system responds by releasing the foam through a series of nozzles; the home is encased with a layer of the foam that leaves wildfire flames with no opportunity to penetrate the structure. A wildfire can pass the protected home and leave it undamaged. The house and everything inside is safe while the fire moves on. This foam is patented and tested to be eco-friendly and successful in protecting homes through burning demonstrations. </p>
<p>Dennis Cortese's patented invention is expontentially cheaper than similar fire suppresant systems on the market today. This eco-friendly product is also easy to install either by yourself or with the help of a contractor. We are currently raising funds to bring this product into complete fruition by bringing it to markets everywhere that are afflicted by wildfires. Right now we have a couple of prototypes, set to head to production.</p>
</div></div>","Imagine that a raging wildfire is spreading out of control, beyond management of firefighters, creeping closer to a rural neighborhood. Residents have been instructed to leave and only have time to collect their families, their selves, and a few precious items before fleeing to safety. Neighbors, family, and friends are forced to become onlookers as flames spread through their yards and begin to creep up the walls of their houses. Homes are devoured by flames, leaving behind charred skeletons of the structures they once were, irreplaceable belongings are reduced to ash. Lives are forever devistated and a solution is so clearly needed. What if there was a way to avoid all of this loss and heartache?
Dennis Cortese, an entrepreneuer from Fort Collins, Colorado, has created such a system to prevent the devistation associated with wildfires: FireStop. This inivative system will protect families and individuals from losing all they have when these threats approach mountain and rural areas.
FireStop is an automated fire suppresant system that protects homes from incoming wildfires. A holding tank of FireStop's heat resistant and flame retardent foam is installed anywhere on the building. Its sensors, fixated to the exterior of a home, indicate the threat of an approaching fire automatically. The system responds by releasing the foam through a series of nozzles; the home is encased with a layer of the foam that leaves wildfire flames with no opportunity to penetrate the structure. A wildfire can pass the protected home and leave it undamaged. The house and everything inside is safe while the fire moves on. This foam is patented and tested to be eco-friendly and successful in protecting homes through burning demonstrations.

Prototype What is the HELPER!The HELPER! is a software interface which allows for the remote management of a device in order to help those less technically capable.  Upon touching the HELPER! icon, a person in need of guidance can choose a person in their network - be it a friend, family member or caregiver- by touching their image icon and connecting with them.  Once the connection is accepted by you, the Helper, you have the ability to mange their device and guide them to complete desired tasks.  You can stay online and enjoy shared time exploring the beautiful world accessible from one’s fingertips.  Once finished, simply turn the management of the device back over to them.  The simple and important creation of The HELPER! can benefit so many individuals in need of basic assistance.  A recent New York Times article reveals that Americans live further away from their parents than ever, an average of over 18 miles.  While technology aids in maintaining bonds, often the confusion creates stress on the strong emotional ties.  The HELPER! allows you to be with them when they need help.  The current solutions of a phone call or text just aren’t that easy for some. Use( Un-complicate the Complicated)
Help people who are scared of technology
Share online experiences with people you care about
Use to explain confusing digital content to those that don’t understand
Assist people who have trouble with their digital devices
Use to teach people about new applications and software
Help people who are physically or cognitively impaired
Spend time with those who are lonely 
Use with people who have language barriers
   Why The HELPER! is important to me:  My Dad with his Granddaughter and Helper​ I started to conceptualize and build the architectural structure of The HELPER! after experiencing a rough year with my 84-year-old Dad.  He said to me, ‘Steve, I never thought I would be this lonely, this frustrated, and frankly, this scared.’  I found it unsettling to hear that coming from my inspiration, the hero that raised me.  Especially coming from a man that spent 55 years selflessly taking care of others as a pastor, a guiding light to those in hospitals and assisted living homes.  I said, ‘Dad, why don’t you listen to the music you love, those old hymns, or watch uplifting family videos?’  To which he said, ‘I just can’t remember how you showed me.’  This led me to realize the problem.  How can we help?  I know we can help!  My dad is not the only one hundreds of miles away from his family struggling to stay positive.                             The Strongest Person I've Ever KnownI was the Caregiver for over a decade for the strongest person I've ever known. She endured chemotherapy for 11 years, one procedure after another.  I stayed with her most nights- both at home and in the hospital.  When I was gone, even for a few hours, she would feel distressed and lonely.  I remember that absent look on her face upon returning to the hospital.  She told me how whenever I left, whether for a few hours or out of town to work, she was instantly overcome by a helpless feeling.  She could never remember what to look to for comfort or where to find things I had told her about on her computer and the internet.  It was so frustrating to see her loneliness and helplessness.  With all the wonderful technological advancements today, still so many get left behind. So the seed was planted.  Now came time to build upon the idea.This inspiration led me towards creating the simple interface of The HELPER!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>We took the well known concept of having everything on your phone simply another step further, and developed a slick solution that would enable you to always have your lighter on you.</p>
<p>We the iLighter team, part of iTics LLC, are a group of young entrepreneurs who have broad experience in the hi-tech, marketing, and advertising worlds.  We have managed to create the prototype using our own means, and this was after endless working hours of allowing the technology to function properly and the design that would be comfortable and modern looking to share with the consumer.  With your help and commitment, we would like to take this product and share it with the world. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise enough money in order to move forward with production on a large scale of the product.</p>
<p>The amount we are asking for is $15,000, and this would give us the initial start-up funds to quickly go into production.</p>
<p>Of course if we raise over the mark we are asking for, we would be able to go beyond the initial phase and market the product in such a way that it can reach everyone.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lighter factories use and burn copious amounts of plastic in order to create an endless number of lighters.  Such factories are part of the more global concern when discussing the sort of impact it has on the environment , and of course this is only a fraction of the issue that is going on.  In this case though, instead of always buying and using disposable lighters, it would be a good option to switch to a reliable, rechargeable version that you wouldn’t have to throw away at the end of every month because it’s out of fluid or simply the thumbwheel stopped turning.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the impact of having such a product is simple, as you wouldn’t be searching for a lighter every time you want to have a cigarette, and ultimately, the time spent for smokers looking for a lighter decreases significantly.</p>
<p>Lastly, less things to carry and worry about in your pockets.  The idea is to have nothing more than your cigarettes and phone in there…and of course perhaps some gum.</p>

Project</span></b>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>I have built so
many websites for my clients that I could not even keep count, but I never
built a website for myself, I mean a real website not some static info website,
but one the stature of the big ones (Hopefully with your help). Many ideas came
to my mind at first but not this one. This project actually came to me by
chance I wanted to add some simple 3D effect to an exciting website, as I was applying
the effect thoughts kept scrolling in my brain. And. I was jumping from idea to
another, going from moment of creativity to the next. Then I thought to myself
why not build a website totally in 3D. I was not thinking about lame wannabe 3D
websites I was thinking about Playstation like 3D Graphics, were the user can
get immersed in a 3D world, navigate and interact within it in a never before
seen manner. I envisioned the completed project as machup between Facebook
&amp; Amazon but in 3D. I new about SocalLife but I wanted something different and
more video game like. I also imaged how this would grow up to an entire virtual
city; with streets, villas, theatre, bars, clubs and oceans. It will be a place
where people can do almost anything they can do in real life, without the risk
of getting smashed by a car.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>As you can see this is a really big
project and I cannot do it on my own. I soon will start taking freelancing Jobs
to support myself as I always did, and it would be harder for me to find the
free time to make this incredible dream a reality. If I get enough funds for
the project I will dedicate my energy full time to this project and treat it as
a full time Job. Even if I don’t reach my funding goal I will keep developing
this project but at a slow snail pace :) since I will be bombard by other
projects.This project is so cool to ignore I won’t stop no matter what. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'>I am looking for fresh minds to back

of concept. So I decided to build a really simple and much smaller scale interactive
demo so people can see my point. Please keep in mind that is nothing like the actual
project but as a proof that the technology exists and that the project can be
done. Sorry for the badly animated character, I know he kinda looks and walks
stupid but the characters in the official project will be highly detailed and incredibly
animated using motion capture technology. Please note that for now the demo requires
a &lt;1MB plug-in but later on it will be plug-in-less.</span></p>

Project
I have built so
many websites for my clients that I could not even keep count, but I never
built a website for myself, I mean a real website not some static info website,
but one the stature of the big ones (Hopefully with your help). Many ideas came
to my mind at first but not this one. This project actually came to me by
chance I wanted to add some simple 3D effect to an exciting website, as I was applying
the effect thoughts kept scrolling in my brain. And. I was jumping from idea to
another, going from moment of creativity to the next. Then I thought to myself
why not build a website totally in 3D. I was not thinking about lame wannabe 3D
websites I was thinking about Playstation like 3D Graphics, were the user can
get immersed in a 3D world, navigate and interact within it in a never before
seen manner. I envisioned the completed project as machup between Facebook
& Amazon but in 3D. I new about SocalLife but I wanted something different and
more video game like. I also imaged how this would grow up to an entire virtual
city; with streets, villas, theatre, bars, clubs and oceans. It will be a place
where people can do almost anything they can do in real life, without the risk
of getting smashed by a car.
As you can see this is a really big
project and I cannot do it on my own. I soon will start taking freelancing Jobs
to support myself as I always did, and it would be harder for me to find the
free time to make this incredible dream a reality. If I get enough funds for
the project I will dedicate my energy full time to this project and treat it as
a full time Job. Even if I don’t reach my funding goal I will keep developing
this project but at a slow snail pace :) since I will be bombard by other
projects.This project is so cool to ignore I won’t stop no matter what. 
I am looking for fresh minds to back
me up on this project and support me in any way possible. Any contribution is a
good contribution. Your name will be engraved somewhere in the project for life.I know people always like to see a proof
of concept. So I decided to build a really simple and much smaller scale interactive
demo so people can see my point. Please keep in mind that is nothing like the actual
project but as a proof that the technology exists and that the project can be
done. Sorry for the badly animated character, I know he kinda looks and walks
stupid but the characters in the official project will be highly detailed and incredibly
animated using motion capture technology. Please note that for now the demo requires
a <1MB plug-in but later on it will be plug-in-less.
http://3dmoviehaven.com/3ddvdstore.php 
The project will be divided into phases;
each phase will have its own campaign. This will be phase one of the project and
will include the following:
1)     
Develop the core engine that control
every aspect of the project
2)     
Build a 4 story high 3D shopping
mall with over 200 unique stores
3)     
Add social networking functionally like
chat, commenting, friend’s management, messaging etc.
4)     
Model 3D characters to roam the
virtual mall
 
Pointers:
1)     
Products in mall can be actually
purchased either by store owners or through affiliates like Amazon
2)     
3D People in the mall will be real
people which you can interact with. You can perform cool stuff like asking a
fellow buyer about products that they have purchase in a specific store and get
their opinion and feedback.
 
 
What makes this project so special?
1)     
This is real 3D. I mean OpenGL like
hardware acceleration type of 3D. Most current websites try to mimic a 3D appearance
but is not actually 3D.
2)     
It offer a never before seen level
of interaction on the web, whether it socializing or buying virtual or real
tangible products.
3)     
Incredibly fun, no boring 2D text
based pages any more.
4)     
Does not require the user to use a
desktop application. Its web based and viewable in all major browsers.
5)     
It has the potential to pave the way
for a new breed of websites. Guess what, your contribution will make you part
of history.
 
Where will the money be spent?
1)     
Foremost it will prevent me from taking
freelance projects, just wanted to be honest
2)     
Hire creative 3D artists to chop in
with the design
3)     
Hire talented programmers to help me
with coding.
This is big project; I cannot do everything
on my own and need all the help I can get.
Development will start as soon as we
start getting funds.

<p> </p>
<h2>Why publish with us</h2>
<p>The decision an author makes on which publishing company to work with can be difficult. Often times an author is either stuck with whomever liked their manuscript, or they self-publish which is a big up front expense most talented authors cannot afford. You, as a writer, have already devoted countless hours and resources into writing your manuscript. Why not let us relieve some of the stress, publish with us for free.

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Traditional Publishing</strong></p>
<p>With the traditional publishing companies several talented authors fall to the waist side due to red tape and bureaucracies. Authors generally need a literary agent in order for publishing companies to even consider their manuscript. Finding an agent to represent you can be even more difficult than finding a needle in a haystack. Each agent has a different taste in the written word increasing the complexity of the situation. With a lot of luck and perseverance an author may find a break.</p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>Self-Publishing</strong>
</h2>
<p>Self-Publishing is a fantastic idea for the author that wishes to do it all on their own: creating a marketing campaign; flying all over the country promoting their book; spending countless hours searching for outlets to sell; and finding funds to support these activities. The first few months for a self-published author can be crippling if the author is unable to fund the activities to continue on. Self-published authors can make more per novel than traditional publishing; however, the author is on their own to do everything. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Finally there is a better way</strong></h2>
<p>We offer an outlet in which any author can succeed. Unlike traditional publishing companies, we do not require agents rather we work directly with the authors. Our mentality is that our authors are our greatest asset and without them we would not exist. This creates a completely different relationship between the author and publishing company. We do not force you into a commitment period, or force you to edit your works to conform to our standards. Rather we allow you to express yourself artistically and provide the outlet for success. Allow us to work for you – submit your manuscript today.</p>

Hi. Ben and Lucas here. We are saving up to buy a 3D Printer.
We could use the printer for both fun and education.

What We Need & What You Get

The printer costs $1,200. We also need a small amount of money for plastic.
If you donate enough, you could get a small, medium, or large item produced by the very 3D printer you helped us buy! All of those items come with a Smile Makers®
If we don't get to our goal, all of the money will go into the printer fund, and we will find other ways to get profit.
Any extra money will go towards plastic for the printer.



The Impact

This machine will be not only entertaining, but it could be educational too.
We have been looking forward to getting one of these machines for a long time!



Other Ways You Can Help

You may not be able to help us by donating, but you can tell other people about us.
Don't forget you can also use the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We have completed the proof of concept phase and are looking for investors to help us manufacture the Combimouse as detailed on the Combimouse website <a href=""http://www.combimouse.com/Funding.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. We can only go into production once the design is complete.<br/></p>
<p>The objective of this campaign is to allow us to continue development while we look for an investor.</p>
<p>We have run two previous Indiegogo campaigns which have helped us progress. You can view the campaigns <a href=""http://igg.me/at/combimouse/x/2873701"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""http://igg.me/at/combimouse2/x/2873701"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<h3><b>What is the Combimouse</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Combimouse is a Combination Keyboard and Mouse that makes computer input easy and very fast.</p>
<p>It is a split keyboard with separate left and right parts to be used by the left and right hands. You don't have to move your hand off the keyboard to use the mouse. For more information on how it works see the <a href=""http://www.combimouse.com/How%20works.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Combimouse website</a>.</p>The mouse feels like a normal mouse and works just as well as a normal mouse.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Combimouse has been in development for a number of years.</p>
<p>There is a lot of interest in the product. Our website has been viewed over 200,000 times and a Google search generates about 50,000 results. In May this year we finally resolved all ergonomic issues and expect to go into production soon. There are about 1.6 billion computers in use and so we think the Combimouse will be very popular.</p>
<h3><b>How it works</b></h3>
<p>Below are two photos showing the two ways the right part can be gripped during mouse mode.</p>
<p>The first one is exactly the same way as gripping a normal mouse. It takes fractionally longer to reach then the second method, but it is more accurate because you wrist is supported on the table.</p>
<p>The time to grip using the second grip mode is virtually zero. Pointing is slighly less accurate than the first method because you wrist isn't supported on the table.</p>
<p>When the part is touched on the right side by the small finger, a sensor is activated and the part switches to mouse mode. The keyboard keys then become mouse click buttons.</p>

<p>While there are existing wireless keyboards out there that are less than 3mm thick, these generally rely on electrostatic touch technology for tactile responses. Wekey's super slim touch keyboard overcomes these circuit and mechanical technological barriers by using constant pressure type film technology and hi-tech components and materials. <br/></p>

<p>Unlike laptops, tablet PC's were developed with the focus of being extremely
portable. However, tablets are not as comfortable to type on as laptops. With
that said, we don't want to carry around thick or heavy keyboards just to use
with our tablets. Wekey was designed to be extremely portable and to fit into
your tablet case like a bookmark, allowing you to use it wherever you are.</p>

concerned that the keyboard will easily break. But as you can see from our
video, even if a car drives over it (or dropped from 5 meters) the keyboard
is highly durable and does not break easily. </span></p>

Using your tablet to give presentations while attached to a projector can be

<p><span>When using your tablet at a cafe, a traditional wireless keyboard is prone to breaking from accidental
coffee spills. But not with Wekey. Simply wipe off the coffee and keep on typing.</span></p>

something no wants to deal with. With its large Li-Po batteries that triples the capacity of
other competitors' keyboards, Wekey can be charged fully in an hour and a half and can be
used for 3 months (avg. 4 hours a day). This means you only need to charge it 4 times a
year! <p></p>

<p>
Multi-pairing support allows up to 3 devices to be paired with Wekey and Wekey will
remember which device and OS it's connected to match the OS's keyboard layout. If multi-pairing is just a basic feature, then Wekey brings the next level of convenience by automatically
configuring to match the OS of the currently connected device for maximum user
comfort. </p>

<p>Unlike cell phones, taking
selfies with a tablet is uncomfortable. Because of their weight and size, using
one hand to open the camera app, getting the right pose, and using the other
hand to press the capture button takes some effort. Wekey can launch the camera
app (Fn + F4) and even take the photo for you allowing you take more natural
photos wherever you may be. <br/></p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>1.<span>  </span></span>Can Wekey be used for iPhones as well as iPads?</b></p>
<p>- Yes, Wekey is compatible with both the iPhone and iPad. However
the touchpad and wheel are only compatible Android and Windows devices. iOS
does not support these features unfortunately and only the keyboard will
function.</p>
<p><b><span>2.<span>  </span></span>How long can I use the batteries for?</b></p>
<p>- Compared to other comparable keyboards
out there, Wekey's batteries have 3 times the capacity with built-in 600mA
Li-Po batteries. After fully charging the battery (1.5 hours charge time),
Wekey can be used for about 3 months without recharging based on an average
daily use for about 4 hours. The batteries can be recharged between 400~500
times which means you only need to charge the keyboard 10 times in one year
(potentially a 40 year lifespan).</p>
<p><b><span>3.<span>  </span></span>How far does Wekey transmit?</b></p>
<p>- Without any obstruction (walls,
furniture, etc.), Wekey can go up to 10 meters. There may be standard
interference due to other electronic devices in the vicinity and decrease the
transmit distance, which is standard for all wireless devices.</p>
<p><b><span>4.<span>  </span></span>The keyboard touch is awkward</b></p>
<p>- Wekey is light, thin, and built to be extremely portable.
Unlike desktop or laptop keyboards, Wekey is built for tablet use for
convenience when writing up simple text or meeting notes. Getting acclimated to
the keyboard can take anywhere from 10 minutes to a day according to our test
users. We ask that you give it some time to become adjusted to using Wekey's
keyboard. </p>
<p><b><span>5.<span>  </span></span>Is it completely waterproof? Can I put it in water?</b></p>
<p>- Wekey is not completely waterproof. Wekey
is protected from accidental spills like soda, water, or coffee. The keys are
highly protected from liquid damage, but the micro-USB port and power switch
are not.</p>

While there are existing wireless keyboards out there that are less than 3mm thick, these generally rely on electrostatic touch technology for tactile responses. Wekey's super slim touch keyboard overcomes these circuit and mechanical technological barriers by using constant pressure type film technology and hi-tech components and materials. 












About Wekey






















Why use Wekey?







Unlike laptops, tablet PC's were developed with the focus of being extremely
portable. However, tablets are not as comfortable to type on as laptops. With
that said, we don't want to carry around thick or heavy keyboards just to use
with our tablets. Wekey was designed to be extremely portable and to fit into
your tablet case like a bookmark, allowing you to use it wherever you are.






Because of its thickness (2.5mm) and weight (160g), a lot of people may be
concerned that the keyboard will easily break. But as you can see from our
video, even if a car drives over it (or dropped from 5 meters) the keyboard
is highly durable and does not break easily. 














Using your tablet to give presentations while attached to a projector can be
inconvenient, but connecting Wekey to an Android powered tablet allows
remote control of the touchpad and wheel (up to 10 meters) for easy slide transitions, pointing, etc. 










When using your tablet at a cafe, a traditional wireless keyboard is prone to breaking from accidental
coffee spills. But not with Wekey. Simply wipe off the coffee and keep on typing.

In addition, from a user's perspective, having to constantly worry about battery life is
something no wants to deal with. With its large Li-Po batteries that triples the capacity of
other competitors' keyboards, Wekey can be charged fully in an hour and a half and can be
used for 3 months (avg. 4 hours a day). This means you only need to charge it 4 times a
year! 














Multi-pairing support allows up to 3 devices to be paired with Wekey and Wekey will
remember which device and OS it's connected to match the OS's keyboard layout. If multi-pairing is just a basic feature, then Wekey brings the next level of convenience by automatically
configuring to match the OS of the currently connected device for maximum user
comfort. 











Unlike cell phones, taking
selfies with a tablet is uncomfortable. Because of their weight and size, using
one hand to open the camera app, getting the right pose, and using the other
hand to press the capture button takes some effort. Wekey can launch the camera
app (Fn + F4) and even take the photo for you allowing you take more natural
photos wherever you may be.

<h2>Who are we and what do we do?</h2>
<p>AppSwarm has plans to be a publicly traded company in the near future. Are we for profit? YES! However, here's the BIG DIFFERENCE. We are actively looking for young entrepreneurially spirited application developers all across the globe who may have a brilliant idea, or even a developed application but do not know how to monetize their dream. </p>
<p>Our area of expertise and our core PASSION is empowering people from across the globe to successfully partner with and help their dreams come true. How?</p>
<p>Established in 2011, App Swarm™ is an application “incubation firm” dedicated to acquiring applications for all forms of devices. If we see an application that we believe has potential, we will engage the person or firm who created it and enter into either a stock purchase agreement or royalty arrangement. We have resources and expertise most small firms or young entrepreneurs and application developers usually do not have, to market applications the most effective way possible. We utilize all forms of social marketing as well as traditional marketing to get as many eyes on the application as possible. We also have agreements in place with all of the major application stores so we can fast track their dream.</p>
<p>I bet anyone who reads this has either thought of a great app idea or knows someone who has one developed but does not know how to effectively monetize their dream. WE WANT TO HELP YOU!</p>
<p><strong>A raging storm can topple a building.</strong> Harnessing that storm can power a revolution. We believe that if properly optimized, marketed and monetized, under-performing apps can turn a real profit – and steadily performing apps can become revenue-generating machines.</p>
<p>Because we work directly with brand name clients and celebrities, we will have the ability to negotiate lucrative sponsorship deals for apps in the Swarm™ as well.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>We are looking to raise $35,000 so we can continue the process of an IPO. These funds will also help continue empowering app developers with their dreams.</div>
<div>
<p>When we get to the IPO stage we have a handful of commitments from underwriters to really up the money raising process. Again, this allows us to spread further out and have a much larger, global impact on entrepreneurs or simply a kid who has developed a brilliant app in his/her parents basement. </p>
<p>We know we can change lives. If we hit our money goal it will enable us to take that next HUGE step. Bottom line, this seed money is more important than the potential millions we can raise in an IPO. Why? Because if we don't raise this core amount of money, then we'll never be able to get to the next level.</p>
