<p>NE Georgia Earthship is an independent project to create an off-grid sustainable home that can be built in any urban environment. This home will be powered by the sun and collect its water from the rain, obtaining all of its resources from nature rather than relying on city municipal services.  In this way we can work in harmony with the sun and sky, allowing the planet to sustain us while also giving it the respect that is deserves through low impact, efficient systems that reduce waste and consume less resources. </p>

<p>Like the original Earthships, our home will implement the use of thermal mass, solar power panels, gray water botanical cells (for reuse and redirection of waste water), solar hot water panels, waste reduction through reuse of glass bottles as bricks in windows and cooling tubes as natural air conditioning. The only difference, between our model and the original Earthships, is that our foundation has been built with concrete, rather than rammed earth tires, which is a key factor in being able to pass building codes in urban areas. We believe that the world will benefit greatly from easier access to these self-reliant homes.</p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Hickman and myself, Rosemary Kimble, are two people that care greatly about the well-being of the planet and living healthy, sustainable lives. We began the project after discovering Earthships through a documentary. Andrew was later invited to intern with Earthship Biotechture in New Mexico and again on a build in Georgia. Through his previous background in building and an enormous amount of research, he has given special attention to previously used techniques to build an Earthship model that focuses on maximum efficiency and durability.  </p>
<p><strong>What does NE Georgia Earthship need?</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We are <strong>ECOMARES Foundation</strong>, a non-governmental organization based in Cali, Colombia. We live in a country with about 50% of its territory covering marine and coastal areas, including oceanic islands, on both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Our mission is to contribute through scientific knowledge and concrete actions to the conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine ecosystems. Our work encompasses different ecosystems and geographic locations in Colombia and we currently have a research project focused on artisanal fishing on the Pacific coast (<a href=""http://www.ecomares.org)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ecomares.org)</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What do we want to do? </strong></h3>
<p>Through a <strong>short-documentary</strong> production (10 to 12 min), we intend to raise awareness among government authorities and society in general about the importance of artisanal fishing for coastal communities in the Colombian Pacific and about the problems faced by artisanal fishermen on a daily basis. Through this communication product we expect to trigger support and actions that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>stimulate greater economic investment in the Pacific coastal region, to improve livelihoods for fishing communities;</li>
<li>promote the creation of a participatory program to identify and construct solutions for a sustainable future of artisanal fishing communities.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What do we need? </strong></h3>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of $3,500 USD. This will help us pay for a director of photography, a film director and a researcher to visit the coastal communities, capture inspiring footage, talk to the locals and produce and edit a compelling short video. </p>
<p>But this is just the first step toward helping these underrepresented communities. With your support, if we can raise more we can do more!</p>
<p>To accomplish our goal, we will partner with the team at <strong>Visual Garden</strong>, local film producers who have experience in this kind of projects and are willing to contribute their staff and equipment as match to successfully make this project a reality (<a href=""http://www.visualgarden.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.visualgarden.tv</a>, <a href=""http://www.hernanherron.com)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hernanherron.com)</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where? </strong></h3>
<p>The Colombian Pacific coast extends for 1,480 kilometres. It is characterized by stunning landscapes of tropical rain forests, mangroves, rocky cliffs, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. The entire region is one of the richest biodiversity ""hot spots"" in the world. Our specific shooting locations are one hour away from Buenaventura, the largest commercial port in the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why is artisanal fishing so important? </strong></h3>
<p>Along the Pacific coast of Colombia, more than 11,000 families of Afro-descendant communities directly depend on artisanal fisheries for their nutrition, income and employment. The production of artisanal fisheries in this region exceeds 5,000 tonnes per year, includes more than 400 species and adds up to at least 15% of total catches from this coast, contributing to the supply of seafood in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of artisanal fisheries for the Pacific region and for Colombia, relatively little is known about the current condition of main fisheries stocks, seasonal or spatial catch variations, differences among fishing gears on their catch and profitability, as well as other aspects that are relevant for the livelihoods of artisanal fishermen. Currently <strong>ECOMARES Foundation</strong> is developing a research project that aims to contribute to these knowledge gaps (<a href=""http://www.ecomares.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ecomares.org</a>)</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
<h3><strong>Risks and challenges </strong></h3>
<p>Filming with the humid and rainy environmental conditions of the Colombian Pacific coast is always challenging. We are preparing for this with adequate water-proof equipment and planning the filming time at each community so that we have the necessary time to get the footage needed.</p>
<p>In terms of potential social conflicts, our fisheries researcher at <strong>ECOMARES Foundation</strong> has established good relationships with community leaders and most of the fishers that live at each of the coastal communities. Visit and filming times will be coordinated with local leaders and taking into account fishers’ activities and preferences.</p>
<p>Note that in case we do not reach the funding goal, raised funds will be dedicated to buy materials to repair and improve fishing gears for local fishers (e.g.: nets, rope, hooks, buoys).</p>
<h3><strong>Other ways you can help us </strong></h3>
<p>In case you consider our idea worth supporting but you do not have all the funds you would like to contribute, you can help us a lot by spreading the word out using the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<p><em><strong>Introduction: Cleantec - Cleantecsystems.com @Cleantecsystems</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Cleantec is a prototyping and development company based out of Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Started and run by inventor, scientist, and entrepreneur Michael Ring 3 years ago with a specific mission to invent, design and develop energy generation and management systems that must be unique, creative, cost-effective, innovative but most of all <strong>disruptive</strong>. Using these guidelines, Cleantec and its staff have committed to stand up and address the energy and environmental problems that if left unsolved will lead to major problems for our modern civilization. In order to succeed in completing this very large goal, an entirely new way of thinking will be needed. Luckily for us, that is exactly what we have. This is something that we will prove in time. </em></p>
<p><em><strong>Short story as to why we have decided to  crowdfund. </strong></em></p>
<p><em>What began with a few good ideas, a few people and inventions quickly transformed into a prototyping and product development company known as Cleantec. That company has since grown into a remarkably large network of people, other companies and organizations that completely support what we do, share our viewpoints and passions, and that have aided us and will continue to aid us in developing our projects. But “build it and they will come” doesn’t necessarily apply to investors and people with financing capabilities, which is exactly where our problem is located.<br/><br/> In an attempt to develop our projects; we have unsuccessfully canvassed Colorado Springs and bits and pieces of Denver looking for the right person to come in and provide the financial assistance we need to move forward. What we found is that people with money ( The 1% big money) have a severe deprivation in imagination. If it hasn’t been done before, if it’s not a real-estate or a software company, the upper-class in Colorado are simply not interested. At all. Now this might not be the case with all wealthy people but there certainly seems to be a very strong correlation between high account balances and low imaginations. But that is just our experience and most likely just luck of the draw. We also got a whole lot of “we admire your passion and technology but this just doesn’t fit our portfolio” too.  Regrettably this put us at a standstill because without any money whatsoever it turns out to be very difficult to build the products we have designed, or anything at all for that matter. </em></p>
<p><em> After all that nonsense and runaround we have decided to crowdfund our secondary product-line CleantecWind with the hope that people with some imagination will see the extraordinary potential and help us do something positive for the community and the world.. A kickstart is exactly what this company needs. One good kick, and she'll fire right up and be able to grow exponentially and hopefully never need venture capital or outside money ever again. So with that, we would like to introduce you to CleantecWind.</em></p>
<h1><strong>CleanTecWind </strong></h1>
<p><strong>Wind for the WIn!! </strong></p>
<p>Wind is one of the most under-harvested and under-utilized resource on this planet. This mostly due to the fact that there really is only one commercially available and practical solution to use it, and that is the windmills. Windmills are very expensive, hard to install, require additional equipment for interfacing with the grid, require land, and must be very large in order to be useful.  We have made some pretty great strides over the last few years in wind power, but we think more options are needed.</p>
<p>CleantecWind is here to change that and solve the problem by offering  new solutions and new additions to your wind power options. We have taken a different approach, rather than large windmills, how about small ones, in large quantities. Chickens compared to elephants.</p>
<h1><strong>What are we going to produce?</strong></h1>
<p>Two, highly advanced, self contained, variable-mounting, variable-orientation wind turbines.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt='32"" Turbine - ""The Burst SI""' class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/655/836/c5591fe17cf1b2e1d4ba6fd2d5ed86f0_large.png?1370652652"" src="""" style=""""/>32"" Turbine - ""The Burst SI""</div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""The 10'  &quot;The Gust SI&quot; turbine shown above in peak wind produces 2X the amount of power the solar panels shown produce"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/645/978/9909fed038311a5f11d8ac8387e1ca4a_large.png?1370377745"" src="""" style=""""/>The 10' ""The Gust SI"" turbine shown above in peak wind produces 2X the amount of power the solar panels shown produce</div>
<p><em>Originally it was designed to attach to and upgrade existing solar panels configured in fields making it the first system to make solar panels useful at night. However, after it was designed, we realized that it didn’t just have to go on solar panels. We saw that a small and efficient wind system like this could be useful in about a dozen other places including streetlights and oil pipelines. Both of which we are really excited about and will talk more about below. </em></p>
<p><strong><em>One important thing - The blades on each turbine are twisted and are not perfectly straight as the images suggest. This twist allows for a corkscrew effect of catching the wind at many more angles than just head on. </em></strong></p>
<h1><strong>Where are we now?</strong></h1>
<p><em>Presently, Cleantec, its products and staff are at a standstill. We have the final designs, the supply lines, the people and the plan all established for the wind turbine. We know exactly where to get the parts, how to assemble them, and what needs to be tested. We know what it needs to look like, how much it should weigh, what it needs to produce to be useful, how to produce that power efficiently and smoothly, and most of all, how to have the price point that is needed for wide-scale adoption and use. The only thing it is missing is the money to produce it, and place the order for the parts. With your help, this turbine can become a reality and begin to contribute to our energy production problems in this country. It needs you. We need you.</em></p>
<h1><strong><em>Where does it go? </em></strong></h1>
<p><em>This turbine can go many places. We have 3 directions we will run with it, which really encompass a great deal of targets. We are confident that we will find even more places for it moving forward</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solar panel fields - Upgrading their purpose and giving them a new job 24/7 </em></strong></p>
<p><em>Solar panel arrays and fields are becoming have become very common in our global push for a more sustainable infrastructure. A great deal of money has been invested into solar fields across the country and world. However that investment has a limit in usefulness. As it is now, solar power has reached a slight plateau. The solar power production methods in use today have inherit limits in efficiency, grid utilization, overall effectiveness, and of course, the night time power production limit. So we designed a product to increase the usefulness of the existing investment and bypass the limits we all have in solar power by adding wind to the current setup. Once installed they will require very little additional hardware or investment from the owner of the field and will provide <strong>substantial</strong> power production increases. <strong>SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE</strong>. It really is a big win-win </em></p>
<ul>
<li>The turbines can be mounted on the top edge of the solar panels with cross supports attached to grounding structures.</li>
<li>Power produced from the turbines can be tied directly to the panel array output connections and grid tie faculties.</li>

<p>And get this, if we were able to put turbines on most of Denver's,  Colorado Springs, and Pueblo's streetlights , congratulations Colorado, you just built the power production capability of a medium nuclear reactor, for like 1/16th the cost. Cool right?</p>
<p>We'll add one more calculation for the mathematically inclined and big picture thinkers just for fun.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 26 Million streetlights in the United States, Let's pretend like somewhere, a good decision was made, and these turbines were put on half of them. 13 Million lights that now each produce 4000 Watts of power, giving us 52GW's of electricity, yes, <strong>Gigawatts</strong> of power production, for life, across the United States or = roughly 1/8th the power of the whole United States. For an investment of roughly $31 Billion dollars, plus shipping.  Now that might seem like a high price-tag for most of us but to achieve 52GW's by conventional means, would create more zeros than we think we could type.   So yes Mr. President, to answer your call for action towards sustainability, we present to you a solution, and yes, we take Visa. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Roof-lines -  </strong>This also just makes sense.

<p>Let's do a few more examples to put this into perspective:</p>
<p>There are 4663 Walmarts in the United States today. Let's say that each one of them, purchased 50 of the Cleantec turbines with the roof-line mounting option that each produce 2000 Watts each.

<p>The turbine featured in the video and in some of the images is just a prototype. It was built with parts that we could afford with the objective to showcase the design and overall form factor. With a successful kickstart, we will be able to deliver a final product.</p>
<p>The final product will be much much cooler, and <strong>significantly</strong> more advanced.</p>
<p>Not shown changes to the design are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Twisted composite blades</strong> - Providing a corkscrew effect to catch the wind at different angles while maintaining strength</li>
<li>
<strong>MagDrive rotors</strong> - Building a few high powered magnets into the rotor and a few on the armature will increase the performance of the turbines and decrease the overall start speed</li>
<li>
<strong>Output indicators </strong>- Cleanly lighted end-caps that go blue when the turbine is producing power, and red for about 15-20 seconds when it is not. Giving it a really cool night time appearance</li>
<li>
<strong>Aluminum construction </strong>- Making the whole turbine light-weight</li>
<li>
<strong>AC pass-through and grid-tie</strong> - Providing stable voltage, series linking and the ability to plug into almost any electrical outlet in homes or businesses to grid-tie. Just plug it in with an extension cord and it is done</li>
<li>
<strong>High-speed Bearings</strong>- Very cost effective and abundant, offering minimal drag</li>
<li>
<strong>Standardized Mount Fittings</strong> - providing different and swappable mounts for the same turbine.</li>
</ul><p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With all these features we have calculated that the start speed should be around 8 mph and peak power production at 16 mph and above.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tech Stuff</strong></p>
<p>Each (10’) AC turbine's power production is internally regulated and capped at 2000W. Each have built-in micro-inverters, regulators, and  storage bank to ensure stable, clean, reliable, manageable and predictable power production output that is sufficient for grid use in all wind conditions.</p>
<p>Each turbine outputs at a constant frequency and rate thanks to the built-in storage bank. When the wind has stopped, the output continues normally until the bank has been depleted past 30% and output is ceased. There is no gradual voltage or current drop.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons we will not be disclosing in full the internal components of this design at this point in time. For two reasons: One, it isn't finished yet and we many improvements that need to made that we will be able to do when we are able to move forward again. Two, If you would like to know how they work, you will just have to buy one and take it apart. Sorry, it's just good business.</p>
<p><strong>2 Initial Versions - 4 Future</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Burst</strong> - 32” Mini Turbine– Peak Wind Power production 500W AC  60Hz - Direct grid-tie</li>
<li>
<strong>The Gust</strong> - 10’ Turbine – Peak Power Production 2000W AC 60Hz- Direct grid-tie</li>
</ul><p><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Initially there will be</strong><strong> 3 mounting options available: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The flat surface (roof) mount.</li>
<li>The C-Clamp style mount.</li>
<li>The Pipe mount (basically giant high-end hose clamps)</li>
<li>For solar panel array mount possibilities please contact us directly.</li>
</ul><h1>.</h1>
<h1><strong>Why is it better?</strong></h1>
<p><em>To further support why this design is advantageous over conventional wind products, we have a short list that we hope will convince you to see the potential. </em></p>
<p><strong>It will be sickeningly cheaper</strong></p>
<p>The costs to produce these units will drop significantly as we move forward. Making it possible for these units to be as abundant and affordable as vacuum cleaners. And when you factor in the removal of the large installation and hardware costs associated with conventional windmills the cost analysis is highly favorable and the economics are very encouraging.</p>
<p>A quick Google search for a 30Kw wind system returns a price of over $30,000, not including installation and other hardware related costs. To get to 30Kw with these turbines it takes 15 units for $18,000... basically installed.</p>
<p>And large orders will get special pricing once we are able to drive the costs down.</p>
<p><strong>Infinitely linkable</strong></p>
<p>Each turbine has an output port of 120v AC and an AC input port. This makes them linkable (think Christmas lights), making it the first modular wind system of its kind. Imagine an oil pipeline (shown above) with wind turbines all the way down it powering the equipment and nearby towns in a good wind. Or imagine highway medians and dividers using some of the wind from traffic to help out a bit. </p>
<p><strong>It's easier to build</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can be made right here in the USA, by American workers and Veterans</li>
<li>Large quantity production designed</li>
<li>Componentized assembly</li>
<li>Abundant and commercially available parts and components</li>
<li>Local suppliers and national suppliers established</li>
</ul><p><strong>Smaller</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Less invasive and disruptive</li>
<li>Easy to install</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Shippable</li>
</ul><p><strong>Many more applications than just solar panels</strong></p>
<p>Several have been mentioned above: oil pipelines, fences, highway medians (when safe obviously) but we believe this is just the beginning of a long list. The idea of roof-lines, not just home roof lines, but large buildings and skyscrapers or even gas station islands is also pretty cool. As these units become produced in large quantities, we hope they find their way to everyplace possible.</p>
<h1><strong>What do we plan to do from here?</strong></h1>
<p><em>Bring it to reality and finish what we have started. As we said in the very beginning, we made a commitment. We will press-on and keep moving forward. Continuing to work and rework our methods and pursue all options until we have succeeded. If this campaign is successful what we plan to do </em>is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-engage operations of Cleantec, its facilities, staff, and plan</li>
<li>Call upon the suppliers that we have established and begin the assembly of the initial units</li>
<li>Test the units, and select the final assembly based on results</li>
<li>Engage operation CleantecWind, which encompasses the order system, sales team and strategy, and rapid production</li>
<li>Fulfill perks of the campaign</li>
<li>In six months time have the final units production methods and assembly methods perfected with large quantities available for sale</li>
<li>Manufacture first few thousand here locally in Colorado Springs using local suppliers and staff and either scale up productions to a bigger facility or outsource main component production to meet demand and/or licensing agreement with a large company as needed</li>
<li>Maintain namespace and brand image at all times to aid in the success of future product lines</li>
</ul><h1><strong>What else do you need to know </strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>We have a team of people ready to go to bring this turbine to life. 20 unique and motivated people that are apart of Cleantec. Ready to rock </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Mounting these turbines onto solar arrays requires a support and a vibration dampening mechanism that we have yet fully establish precise specs for due to the fact that there are many different types of solar mounting systems and the product is not quite ready. It is our plan to generate a few different options moving forward in the coming stages when we are able to proceed.</li>
<li>We wont be alone. We will leverage the entirely of our network of partners to move this project forward, which includes state and local government, some federal government connections, local contractors, local suppliers, and a ton more people and companies that share the vision of this product and have offered to help us bring it to life.</li>
<li>We have additional wind solutions that we will deliver in time, so help us now, and we will get there together</li>
<li>The reason the website is locked is because we have more to show but it is all not quite ready. One thing at a time. </li>
<li>This is only the beginning for Cleantec. <em>Strap in world, you're about be rocked. </em>

<p> </p></div>","Introduction: Cleantec - Cleantecsystems.com @Cleantecsystems
Cleantec is a prototyping and development company based out of Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Started and run by inventor, scientist, and entrepreneur Michael Ring 3 years ago with a specific mission to invent, design and develop energy generation and management systems that must be unique, creative, cost-effective, innovative but most of all disruptive. Using these guidelines, Cleantec and its staff have committed to stand up and address the energy and environmental problems that if left unsolved will lead to major problems for our modern civilization. In order to succeed in completing this very large goal, an entirely new way of thinking will be needed. Luckily for us, that is exactly what we have. This is something that we will prove in time. 
Short story as to why we have decided to  crowdfund. 
What began with a few good ideas, a few people and inventions quickly transformed into a prototyping and product development company known as Cleantec. That company has since grown into a remarkably large network of people, other companies and organizations that completely support what we do, share our viewpoints and passions, and that have aided us and will continue to aid us in developing our projects. But “build it and they will come” doesn’t necessarily apply to investors and people with financing capabilities, which is exactly where our problem is located. In an attempt to develop our projects; we have unsuccessfully canvassed Colorado Springs and bits and pieces of Denver looking for the right person to come in and provide the financial assistance we need to move forward. What we found is that people with money ( The 1% big money) have a severe deprivation in imagination. If it hasn’t been done before, if it’s not a real-estate or a software company, the upper-class in Colorado are simply not interested. At all. Now this might not be the case with all wealthy people but there certainly seems to be a very strong correlation between high account balances and low imaginations. But that is just our experience and most likely just luck of the draw. We also got a whole lot of “we admire your passion and technology but this just doesn’t fit our portfolio” too.  Regrettably this put us at a standstill because without any money whatsoever it turns out to be very difficult to build the products we have designed, or anything at all for that matter. 
 After all that nonsense and runaround we have decided to crowdfund our secondary product-line CleantecWind with the hope that people with some imagination will see the extraordinary potential and help us do something positive for the community and the world.. A kickstart is exactly what this company needs. One good kick, and she'll fire right up and be able to grow exponentially and hopefully never need venture capital or outside money ever again. So with that, we would like to introduce you to CleantecWind.
CleanTecWind 
Wind for the WIn!! 
Wind is one of the most under-harvested and under-utilized resource on this planet. This mostly due to the fact that there really is only one commercially available and practical solution to use it, and that is the windmills. Windmills are very expensive, hard to install, require additional equipment for interfacing with the grid, require land, and must be very large in order to be useful.  We have made some pretty great strides over the last few years in wind power, but we think more options are needed.
CleantecWind is here to change that and solve the problem by offering  new solutions and new additions to your wind power options. We have taken a different approach, rather than large windmills, how about small ones, in large quantities. Chickens compared to elephants.
What are we going to produce?
Two, highly advanced, self contained, variable-mounting, variable-orientation wind turbines.

32"" Turbine - ""The Burst SI""

The 10' ""The Gust SI"" turbine shown above in peak wind produces 2X the amount of power the solar panels shown produce
Originally it was designed to attach to and upgrade existing solar panels configured in fields making it the first system to make solar panels useful at night. However, after it was designed, we realized that it didn’t just have to go on solar panels. We saw that a small and efficient wind system like this could be useful in about a dozen other places including streetlights and oil pipelines. Both of which we are really excited about and will talk more about below. 
One important thing - The blades on each turbine are twisted and are not perfectly straight as the images suggest. This twist allows for a corkscrew effect of catching the wind at many more angles than just head on. 
Where are we now?
Presently, Cleantec, its products and staff are at a standstill. We have the final designs, the supply lines, the people and the plan all established for the wind turbine. We know exactly where to get the parts, how to assemble them, and what needs to be tested. We know what it needs to look like, how much it should weigh, what it needs to produce to be useful, how to produce that power efficiently and smoothly, and most of all, how to have the price point that is needed for wide-scale adoption and use. The only thing it is missing is the money to produce it, and place the order for the parts. With your help, this turbine can become a reality and begin to contribute to our energy production problems in this country. It needs you. We need you.
Where does it go? 
This turbine can go many places. We have 3 directions we will run with it, which really encompass a great deal of targets. We are confident that we will find even more places for it moving forward.
Solar panel fields - Upgrading their purpose and giving them a new job 24/7 
Solar panel arrays and fields are becoming have become very common in our global push for a more sustainable infrastructure. A great deal of money has been invested into solar fields across the country and world. However that investment has a limit in usefulness. As it is now, solar power has reached a slight plateau. The solar power production methods in use today have inherit limits in efficiency, grid utilization, overall effectiveness, and of course, the night time power production limit. So we designed a product to increase the usefulness of the existing investment and bypass the limits we all have in solar power by adding wind to the current setup. Once installed they will require very little additional hardware or investment from the owner of the field and will provide substantial power production increases. SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE. It really is a big win-win 

The turbines can be mounted on the top edge of the solar panels with cross supports attached to grounding structures.
Power produced from the turbines can be tied directly to the panel array output connections and grid tie faculties.
Potential installation targets: There are over 83 separate large solar (photovoltaic) fields power plants with over 10,000 panels per installation. Some of which have over 900,000 panels. All of which are useless at night. This product absolutely belongs here.


4 of ? Solar fields - No image credit taken
Streetlights and Light Poles - Because it makes sense
Using the same turbines, and merely changing the mounts, we can use streetlights and light poles as a base structure for our turbines. This gives us the option to tie to the the grid at each light and assist the light in its duties. Presently, the power grid is not quite capable of effectively handling an intermittent power source like the wind yet, so initially the power produced by these turbines will be directed towards assisting the lamp only. Eventually, the smart-grid will be fully developed, and when that happens, the power produced by these units will become even more useful in providing power to the grid at every light.

Potential local installations in Cosprings 20,000
Potential statewide Installations 10^ 5
Potential national installations 10^ 7
    .
And get this, if we were able to put turbines on most of Denver's,  Colorado Springs, and Pueblo's streetlights , congratulations Colorado, you just built the power production capability of a medium nuclear reactor, for like 1/16th the cost. Cool right?
We'll add one more calculation for the mathematically inclined and big picture thinkers just for fun.
There are an estimated 26 Million streetlights in the United States, Let's pretend like somewhere, a good decision was made, and these turbines were put on half of them. 13 Million lights that now each produce 4000 Watts of power, giving us 52GW's of electricity, yes, Gigawatts of power production, for life, across the United States or = roughly 1/8th the power of the whole United States. For an investment of roughly $31 Billion dollars, plus shipping.  Now that might seem like a high price-tag for most of us but to achieve 52GW's by conventional means, would create more zeros than we think we could type.   So yes Mr. President, to answer your call for action towards sustainability, we present to you a solution, and yes, we take Visa. ;-)

Fences, Medians, and Pipelines -1 mile of installations= 1MW power production for  $633,600 ( 1MW could cost well over 2 million dollars for just solar panels alone not including grid interface equipment). We understand that that number is high for most of us, but for states that are looking into alternative energy, that number is very attractive compared to other solutions out there today.

Pipeline Example
Roof-lines -  This also just makes sense. Since the turbines can be mounted in any orientation and still catch the wind without requiring a pole mount structure, the location options for installing wind power have gone up substantially. Skyscrapers shown below are a candidate for wind power now. Better yet, now every gas station, Mcdonalds, Starbucks and Walmart's etc can now have wind power added to them.... Cost effectively. 
Let's do a few more examples to put this into perspective:
There are 4663 Walmarts in the United States today. Let's say that each one of them, purchased 50 of the Cleantec turbines with the roof-line mounting option that each produce 2000 Watts each. If that happened, Walmart as a company would collectively produce 466.3MW (megawatts) of power, for a price-tag of $280 million dollars. Dramatically more affordable.
For comparison, the Topaz Solar Farm in California, produces about 550 MW (megawatts) and cost roughly $2 Billion to complete after install.
12 for each of the 14,000 McDonalds in the United States is 336 MW (Megawatts)
10 for each of the 11,168 Starbucks in the United States = 223.4MW and so on and so fourth.
They add up substantially 

New York and Chicago, this one is for you :-)
About the Turbine

The 10' ""The Gust SI"" Turbine
The turbine featured in the video and in some of the images is just a prototype. It was built with parts that we could afford with the objective to showcase the design and overall form factor. With a successful kickstart, we will be able to deliver a final product.
The final product will be much much cooler, and significantly more advanced.
Not shown changes to the design are as follows:


Twisted composite blades - Providing a corkscrew effect to catch the wind at different angles while maintaining strength

MagDrive rotors - Building a few high powered magnets into the rotor and a few on the armature will increase the performance of the turbines and decrease the overall start speed

Output indicators - Cleanly lighted end-caps that go blue when the turbine is producing power, and red for about 15-20 seconds when it is not. Giving it a really cool night time appearance

Aluminum construction - Making the whole turbine light-weight

AC pass-through and grid-tie - Providing stable voltage, series linking and the ability to plug into almost any electrical outlet in homes or businesses to grid-tie. Just plug it in with an extension cord and it is done

High-speed Bearings- Very cost effective and abundant, offering minimal drag

Standardized Mount Fittings - providing different and swappable mounts for the same turbine.
.
With all these features we have calculated that the start speed should be around 8 mph and peak power production at 16 mph and above.
Tech Stuff
Each (10’) AC turbine's power production is internally regulated and capped at 2000W. Each have built-in micro-inverters, regulators, and  storage bank to ensure stable, clean, reliable, manageable and predictable power production output that is sufficient for grid use in all wind conditions.
Each turbine outputs at a constant frequency and rate thanks to the built-in storage bank. When the wind has stopped, the output continues normally until the bank has been depleted past 30% and output is ceased. There is no gradual voltage or current drop.
For obvious reasons we will not be disclosing in full the internal components of this design at this point in time. For two reasons: One, it isn't finished yet and we many improvements that need to made that we will be able to do when we are able to move forward again. Two, If you would like to know how they work, you will just have to buy one and take it apart. Sorry, it's just good business.
2 Initial Versions - 4 Future


The Burst - 32” Mini Turbine– Peak Wind Power production 500W AC  60Hz - Direct grid-tie

.
Initially there will be 3 mounting options available: 

The flat surface (roof) mount.
The C-Clamp style mount.
The Pipe mount (basically giant high-end hose clamps)
For solar panel array mount possibilities please contact us directly.
.
Why is it better?
To further support why this design is advantageous over conventional wind products, we have a short list that we hope will convince you to see the potential. 
It will be sickeningly cheaper
The costs to produce these units will drop significantly as we move forward. Making it possible for these units to be as abundant and affordable as vacuum cleaners. And when you factor in the removal of the large installation and hardware costs associated with conventional windmills the cost analysis is highly favorable and the economics are very encouraging.

Each turbine has an output port of 120v AC and an AC input port. This makes them linkable (think Christmas lights), making it the first modular wind system of its kind. Imagine an oil pipeline (shown above) with wind turbines all the way down it powering the equipment and nearby towns in a good wind. Or imagine highway medians and dividers using some of the wind from traffic to help out a bit.

Several have been mentioned above: oil pipelines, fences, highway medians (when safe obviously) but we believe this is just the beginning of a long list. The idea of roof-lines, not just home roof lines, but large buildings and skyscrapers or even gas station islands is also pretty cool.

Bring it to reality and finish what we have started. As we said in the very beginning, we made a commitment. We will press-on and keep moving forward. Continuing to work and rework our methods and pursue all options until we have succeeded. If this campaign is successful what we plan to do is:

Re-engage operations of Cleantec, its facilities, staff, and plan
Call upon the suppliers that we have established and begin the assembly of the initial units
Test the units, and select the final assembly based on results
Engage operation CleantecWind, which encompasses the order system, sales team and strategy, and rapid production
Fulfill perks of the campaign
In six months time have the final units production methods and assembly methods perfected with large quantities available for sale
Manufacture first few thousand here locally in Colorado Springs using local suppliers and staff and either scale up productions to a bigger facility or outsource main component production to meet demand and/or licensing agreement with a large company as needed
Maintain namespace and brand image at all times to aid in the success of future product lines
What else do you need to know 

We have a team of people ready to go to bring this turbine to life. 20 unique and motivated people that are apart of Cleantec. Ready to rock 

Mounting these turbines onto solar arrays requires a support and a vibration dampening mechanism that we have yet fully establish precise specs for due to the fact that there are many different types of solar mounting systems and the product is not quite ready. It is our plan to generate a few different options moving forward in the coming stages when we are able to proceed.
We wont be alone. We will leverage the entirely of our network of partners to move this project forward, which includes state and local government, some federal government connections, local contractors, local suppliers, and a ton more people and companies that share the vision of this product and have offered to help us bring it to life.
We have additional wind solutions that we will deliver in time, so help us now, and we will get there together
The reason the website is locked is because we have more to show but it is all not quite ready. One thing at a time. 
This is only the beginning for Cleantec. Strap in world, you're about be rocked.

<p>
</p>
<p>This is an exclusive invitation to continue to develop the Schierman's fourth-generation family farmstead, Schierman Sanctuary as a 40-acre private park and rural retreat destination on the Palouse.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""> Schierman
 Sanctuary is a man-made private park in rural Eastern Washington State,
 it is aptly dubbed the 'Oasis' and often called the 'Shire'. It stands 
out on the Palouse with it's 
deep green foliage, lush lawns, water features, and abundant 
wildlife. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The success of this campaign will make property enhancement and park expansion happen sooner and steadier. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Your contributions will provide an amazing private hideaway to share with friends and family. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">Schierman Sanctuary will be exclusive to Indiegogo contributors and their guests. </span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The complete design includes:<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>  Two open-air amphitheaters with multipurpose pavilion stages, one for drive-in concerts.<br/></p>
<p> Edible and experimental gardens, a nursery, and year-round pit greenhouses for edibles and aquaculture.<br/></p>
<p>Camping and private group camp areas.</p>
<p>Private tiny guest houses both seasonal and year-round.<br/></p>
<p>Catering kitchen and small bistro/bar serving local foods and beverages.</p>
<p> Gear rental shop.<br/></p>
<p>Large multipurpose studios for art residency, retreats, and sustainable workshops.</p>
<p>Permanent restrooms with indoor/outdoor showers, spa and sauna.<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<br/><p>Let your imagination wander... You are a photographer seeking unique settings and serenity in the country; adventurers looking for new and relatively unexplored lands without crowds or tourists; artists, writers or musicians looking for a retreat or studio residency; a couple dreaming of a rustic summer vacation destination in an airy cabin with campfires under the stars; A family planning a memorable reunion; or a group of friends looking for an exclusive and intimate weekend concert destination.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Every season provides opportunities for exploring by bike, kayak, canoe, car, motorcycle, boat, by air, horseback, or on foot. Winter provides an especially surreal landscape for photography, hiking, telemark or cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, curling up in a cozy little cabin, working in a warehouse studio space or playing indoor games in the rec barn with friends.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Palouse contains diverse nature, unique terrain, secret landmarks, hidden waterfalls, mysterious lakes, ghost towns, old </span>cemeteries<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, quaint country towns, abandoned railroad tunnels and trestles, great fishing, miles of country back roads, and so much more. Several of the local towns are great for relaxed games of golf that are reasonably priced with little waiting and few other golfers. There are private airstrips nearby if you wish to bring your own plane and you may also book private sightseeing plane tours locally. </span> </p>
<p>You will have the time of your life staying where the hosts have enjoyed a lifetime exploring the Palouse. Tom Schierman is a Palouse landscape photographer, capturing hundreds, sometimes over a thousand photos every day. Sunset and sunrise are almost always spectacular as are the shadows on the land. The diversity of the terrain and the daily color changes of the fields and seasons is something everyone should experience more than once.</p>
<p><b>This is where the funding will go:<br/></b></p>
<p><b><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">-Each of the existing farm buildings need some type of interior or exterior repair or remodel to create a more aesthetic and functional rustic resort ambiance. The interior and surrounding exterior spaces need to be available for relaxing, entertainment, and multipurpose guest use. Generally speaking, the buildings need roofing repairs, interior/exterior addition, concrete floors, lumber, flooring, insulation, walls...the list goes on, but it's not impossible, so we'll start with the most necessary priorities, like roofing repairs that need to be done before winter, creating guest and volunteer quarters, and making multipurpose studios and lounge areas in existing buildings. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></span></b></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">-At a minimum,</b><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> permanent restrooms with indoor and outdoor showers need to be built and connected to a new septic system and drain field engineered for public use.</b></p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If funding is successful, at least one private cabin or bunkhouse will be built.<br/></b>
</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></b></p>

<p>This campaign <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">will provide building materials, furniture, fund equipment rental, septic system and plumbing, update and expand electrical, and install ambient property lighting. Even at the funding requested, expenses will have to be juggled incredibly carefully since it is the bare minimum needed to open with </span>accommodations<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> for guests. The Schiermans and volunteer crew will take on as much work as possible to decrease labor costs so more funding can go toward materials. </span></p>
<p>Extra funding will benefit the property immensely and will provide more amenities now versus later. This could include construction of more private guest houses and potentially more luxurious rustic resort amenities (like a sauna and spa or big outdoor kitchen) and expansion of the park grounds depending on your votes and contributions. This is a collaborative effort to create the retreat atmosphere you yearn to experience on the Palouse. However, you are welcome to sit back and watch the progress without adding input too.<br/><br/>If funding comes up short, the development process must start with the most important building enhancement requirements - however, the park may not be able to fully open to guests or host events as soon as everyone would like. It's safe to say you want to experience the park as soon as possible and probably more often than you realize.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Tom Schierman (father and official property owner) has been planting and expanding the park for 40 years. He fancies himself the 'park ranger'. When he began planting there was hardly a tree on the property, now there are too many to count and the park is rich with abundant life. When Tom moved home from college the farmstead was a typical wide-open Palouse farm. Nothing special. He babied rows of tiny trees all around the farmhouse until they were big enough to transplant around the property permanently. He has photographed the entire growth and expansion since he started as a younger man. Something special indeed. In the last five years these three men planted over 1500 trees and shrubs from their own private nursery to expand the landscape.<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""> <br/></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>James Schierman (32) has been involved with farming, gardening, and tree planting since very young. He was born in the family farmhouse in frigid February on a water bed and first weighed on a sausage scale. He moved home from college in 2003 following his heart back home and a freedom for his imagination. He is the unofficial 'property manager' and development visionary creating and designing guest cabins, deciding road and infrastructure placement, new landscape design, water feature creation, existing building remodel, guest amenities, websites, and property infrastructure.</p>

<p></p></div>","Schierman Sanctuary


This is an exclusive invitation to continue to develop the Schierman's fourth-generation family farmstead, Schierman Sanctuary as a 40-acre private park and rural retreat destination on the Palouse. Schierman
 Sanctuary is a man-made private park in rural Eastern Washington State,
 it is aptly dubbed the 'Oasis' and often called the 'Shire'. It stands 
out on the Palouse with it's 
deep green foliage, lush lawns, water features, and abundant 
wildlife. The success of this campaign will make property enhancement and park expansion happen sooner and steadier. Your contributions will provide an amazing private hideaway to share with friends and family. Schierman Sanctuary will be exclusive to Indiegogo contributors and their guests. The complete design includes:
  Two open-air amphitheaters with multipurpose pavilion stages, one for drive-in concerts.
 Edible and experimental gardens, a nursery, and year-round pit greenhouses for edibles and aquaculture.
Camping and private group camp areas.
Private tiny guest houses both seasonal and year-round.
Catering kitchen and small bistro/bar serving local foods and beverages.
 Gear rental shop.
Large multipurpose studios for art residency, retreats, and sustainable workshops.
Permanent restrooms with indoor/outdoor showers, spa and sauna.
 
Let your imagination wander... You are a photographer seeking unique settings and serenity in the country; adventurers looking for new and relatively unexplored lands without crowds or tourists; artists, writers or musicians looking for a retreat or studio residency; a couple dreaming of a rustic summer vacation destination in an airy cabin with campfires under the stars; A family planning a memorable reunion; or a group of friends looking for an exclusive and intimate weekend concert destination.
Every season provides opportunities for exploring by bike, kayak, canoe, car, motorcycle, boat, by air, horseback, or on foot. Winter provides an especially surreal landscape for photography, hiking, telemark or cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, curling up in a cozy little cabin, working in a warehouse studio space or playing indoor games in the rec barn with friends.
The Palouse contains diverse nature, unique terrain, secret landmarks, hidden waterfalls, mysterious lakes, ghost towns, old cemeteries, quaint country towns, abandoned railroad tunnels and trestles, great fishing, miles of country back roads, and so much more. Several of the local towns are great for relaxed games of golf that are reasonably priced with little waiting and few other golfers. There are private airstrips nearby if you wish to bring your own plane and you may also book private sightseeing plane tours locally.  
You will have the time of your life staying where the hosts have enjoyed a lifetime exploring the Palouse. Tom Schierman is a Palouse landscape photographer, capturing hundreds, sometimes over a thousand photos every day. Sunset and sunrise are almost always spectacular as are the shadows on the land. The diversity of the terrain and the daily color changes of the fields and seasons is something everyone should experience more than once.
This is where the funding will go:
-Each of the existing farm buildings need some type of interior or exterior repair or remodel to create a more aesthetic and functional rustic resort ambiance. The interior and surrounding exterior spaces need to be available for relaxing, entertainment, and multipurpose guest use. Generally speaking, the buildings need roofing repairs, interior/exterior addition, concrete floors, lumber, flooring, insulation, walls...the list goes on, but it's not impossible, so we'll start with the most necessary priorities, like roofing repairs that need to be done before winter, creating guest and volunteer quarters, and making multipurpose studios and lounge areas in existing buildings. 
-At a minimum, permanent restrooms with indoor and outdoor showers need to be built and connected to a new septic system and drain field engineered for public use.
If funding is successful, at least one private cabin or bunkhouse will be built.



This campaign will provide building materials, furniture, fund equipment rental, septic system and plumbing, update and expand electrical, and install ambient property lighting. Even at the funding requested, expenses will have to be juggled incredibly carefully since it is the bare minimum needed to open with accommodations for guests. The Schiermans and volunteer crew will take on as much work as possible to decrease labor costs so more funding can go toward materials. 
Extra funding will benefit the property immensely and will provide more amenities now versus later. This could include construction of more private guest houses and potentially more luxurious rustic resort amenities (like a sauna and spa or big outdoor kitchen) and expansion of the park grounds depending on your votes and contributions. This is a collaborative effort to create the retreat atmosphere you yearn to experience on the Palouse. However, you are welcome to sit back and watch the progress without adding input too.If funding comes up short, the development process must start with the most important building enhancement requirements - however, the park may not be able to fully open to guests or host events as soon as everyone would like. It's safe to say you want to experience the park as soon as possible and probably more often than you realize.
The
 goal is to utilize green and reclaimed materials, alternative energy, 
sustainable practices, and intelligent design everywhere possible. This 
development is being designed with care to be gentle on the environment 
and blend in to the surroundings.
The successful campaign will have a lively open-house party with local talent for completion celebration. You are welcome to visit and tour or camp on select dates during construction and celebrations. 
When this project is complete you will have created an astounding and permanent rural destination experience in the Pacific Northwest.
Farm Buildings
-Schierman Barn is being designated as a rec hall for social gatherings, acoustic concerts, private events, workshops, and indoor games. Currently it contains Billiards, Darts, Foosball, Ping-Pong, and a giant set of Jenga with more to come.
-The ""Machine Shed"" is on it's way to becoming a large multipurpose backstage warehouse for meetings and indoor social functions with bar, loft lounge, and indoor stage with a big open layout.
-The shop complex will be renovated and expanded to house multipurpose studios and the connected ""blacksmith shop"" and bunkhouse will become a gear rental and repair shop. Parts of it need new roofing and remodel badly before winter.
-The farmhouse is being redesigned as a club house with guest loft, catering kitchen, offices, and media lounge.
-The 1920's carriage house will serve as a front desk and Palouse travel kiosk with local maps, photos, sightseeing, unique local travel destinations, the history of the property and surrounding area, and guided tours of the Palouse. 
-""Windmill Hill""-The hillside field with a windmill centerpiece is now a large lawn amphitheater.
-8 acres of field will be turned into large lawns and landscapes for camping, drive-in concerts and ope-air events.-There are several private campfire pits and full-size outdoor game courts placed around the property for additional leisure and recreation amenities. Currently it hosts Bocce Ball, Croquet, Horsehoes, Kubb, and Basketball with more coming soon.
-A big, year-round pit greenhouse is being planned for organic garden food. A major goal is to serve guests fresh veggies and herbs, homemade stews and soups, handmade breads, local seafood, locally sourced meats, herbal blended butters, wood-smoked delights, and free-range eggs,  as well as local Palouse beers, wines, and hand-crafted alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

The Palouse is starting to gain recognition as the ""Tuscany of America"" by photographers and travel writers. 
This photo by Tom Schierman is the Northern corner of Schierman Sanctuary, and shows some of the hillside in the foreground where the new guest cabins will be sited. Picture sitting on the front porch with this view.
Schierman Sanctuary is nestled in soft rolling hills, but the rough 'scablands' of the great Missoula floods are right out the back door- Less than fifteen minutes away is a unique perspective of the wild West. The massive glacial floods created a mess of interesting landscapes with lakes, rivers and waterfalls. It's not hard to imagine outlaws and Indians in the Palouse scablands. 
 Schierman Sanctuary exists to bring people together to collaborate on creations that enhance the health and happiness of society. Plus, opening Schierman Sanctuary to guests is tremendously important because it keeps the Schierman family working on the farm without having to commute to a job elsewhere, and it permanently secures the nearly 100 year-old Schierman farmstead as a place for relaxing and entertaining by covering large expenses. Your support will make a huge impact for like-minded people interested in securing a privately-owned country destination. It will provide a base for people around the globe to experience the Palouse region, provide local jobs, and bring guest amenities off the drawing board. This venture will always promote local communities and strive to boost local economies while advocating sustainability and environmentalism. 

The Schierman Sanctuary Team
Tom Schierman (father and official property owner) has been planting and expanding the park for 40 years. He fancies himself the 'park ranger'. When he began planting there was hardly a tree on the property, now there are too many to count and the park is rich with abundant life. When Tom moved home from college the farmstead was a typical wide-open Palouse farm. Nothing special. He babied rows of tiny trees all around the farmhouse until they were big enough to transplant around the property permanently. He has photographed the entire growth and expansion since he started as a younger man. Something special indeed. In the last five years these three men planted over 1500 trees and shrubs from their own private nursery to expand the landscape. 
James Schierman (32) has been involved with farming, gardening, and tree planting since very young. He was born in the family farmhouse in frigid February on a water bed and first weighed on a sausage scale. He moved home from college in 2003 following his heart back home and a freedom for his imagination. He is the unofficial 'property manager' and development visionary creating and designing guest cabins, deciding road and infrastructure placement, new landscape design, water feature creation, existing building remodel, guest amenities, websites, and property infrastructure.
Jon Schierman (23) has also been involved with the growth of the park since he was very young, and has been a critical groundskeeper helping to irrigate, garden, mow, create new tree groves, and a great deal of other landscape maintenance and property enhancement. He is elemental in the effort to transform the farm to open the property to the public.
Countless friends and family have been tremendously beneficial to the creation of Schierman Sanctuary, and while not naming any names here, the gratitude remains strong. You will all receive special acknowledgement and perks for helping bring this project to the world.

Yet we are trying to work within the current U.S. laws to regain custody of our sacred sites and prevent future road and industrial development. Our sacred ways must be protected and passed on to our future generations so that our children may live. This area of the Paha Sapa (Black Hills) is also home to many plants and animals who should also be protected.

The principal investigator, David Swenson, received his PhD in
1975 from the University of Wisconsin and is now semi retired in the Phoenix
Arizona area. He has been involved in a multiplicity of different projects
which require problem-solving and outside the box thinking. This project will
be carried out to support the work of Brien Foerster, of Cusco Peru, who has been
involved in the study of ancient people and their associated megalithic
buildings. Samples of andesite stone
from Tiwanaku and Puma Punku that have come from the megaliths will be shipped from Peru. David will
photograph, measure and forward the samples to the PRIME laboratory at Purdue
University for analysis and dating of the stone based on beryllium-10 production
from cosmic rays by way of accelerator mass spectrometry. The purpose of this

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At SkyTruth, our motto is ""If you can see it, you can change it""  By 
making the impacts of oil and gas drilling more visible and more 
measurable, we believe that we (that's we the concerned public) can change them.  Most of the wasteful flaring and venting can be dramatically reduced by obligating operators to capture the gas and related liquids and turn them in to useful products, thereby offsetting new natural gas drilling elsewhere in the country.  Or they can generate electricity on site with it.  Actually there are loads of good alternatives available, it's just that flaring off the gas is the cheapest (and dirtiest).</p>

Here's what flaring in the Bakken looks like from the ground




This is what the balloon rig looks like in flight

What We Need
So what we need to do is buy all the gear, get our dedicated and all-volunteer team out to Williston, ND, assemble the sensor rig, get the helium we need for the balloons, launch the rig, collect the data and make a fun-filled video of the whole thing.  Then we come back to Shepherdstown to crunch the data, publish our data,  edit the mission video and congratulate ourselves on a job well done, while we figure out which jacket to put our stupendous new mission patches on.


What we're asking you to help with is the cost of transportation for our team of 5 volunteers and the equipment we need to buy for the mission.  



$1,000 for out of pocket travel costs (we're carpooling on the road trip out there, living in tents, and we don't eat much) 
$1,500 for equipment (balloons, helium, electronics for the sensors, cameras)

All told we need $2,500 to cover the base cost of the mission
But... if we can raise an additional $4,000 then we can get this super cool FLIR e40 infrared camera that will help us tell the difference between flaring and rig lights, as well as helping us look for methane releases.

And if we raise even more than that, we can do another mission!  Next time maybe over the Athabascan Tar Sands in Canada, mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia, or maybe just somewhere tropical...
What's the Point?
At SkyTruth, our motto is ""If you can see it, you can change it""  By 
making the impacts of oil and gas drilling more visible and more 
measurable, we believe that we (that's we the concerned public) can change them.  Most of the wasteful flaring and venting can be dramatically reduced by obligating operators to capture the gas and related liquids and turn them in to useful products, thereby offsetting new natural gas drilling elsewhere in the country.  Or they can generate electricity on site with it.  Actually there are loads of good alternatives available, it's just that flaring off the gas is the cheapest (and dirtiest).
How Can I Help?
Please support our passionate and talented engineers as they devote their skills, time and energy to making the world a better place.  You can make a donation by selecting your contribution level on the right. We are a 501c3 nonprofit, so if you live in the United States your entire contribution is tax deductible, except for the cash value of the mission patch, which we will have for you by the time we ship them.
If you're totally jazzed and want to help, but you just don't have the cash, we total understand.  You can still help out.   Share this page with as many people as you can.  Read the recent Washington Post coverage of SkyTruth and share that.  And if you want to try a little skytruthing yourself, you can contribute a little bit of your time and energy to our FrackFinder project.
Mission Patch
The Limited Edition Mission Patch will look something like this .  So ok - it's just a doodle on  a whiteboard, but we have a real volunteer designer working on it, we promise. It's going to be totally awesome.

</div></b></b></h2>
<p>Our oceans are at the point of crisis; scientists have reported that in the last 50 years we have lost over 90%
of the global shark population due to overfishing and shark finning. Sharks as apex predators play a critical role in marine
ecosystems, and their decline is having catastrophic consequences.<br/>
By journeying around the world and documenting the story of the people who are actively tackling these issues, we hope to
create a tool that will be invaluable in inspiring the UK to join this growing conservation movement. </p>

<p>Communities and ordinary individuals around the world are leading the way in the movement to save sharks;
pushing for protection through the creation of marine reserves and shark fin bans, however awareness of this
critical issue in the UK is currently lacking and many people are apathetic.<br/>Our aims are three fold; Through this journey we hope to meet and establish a global network of these
innovators, the sum of who's work is collaboratively combating a difficult issue. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through documenting their stories we aim to raise vital awareness as well as promote positive attitudes;
celebrating successful campaigning as a way of getting people excited about being a part of something and
making it achievable.</span></p>

<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>
<p>Our project has a three
part approach:</p>
<p>1. BUILD THE NETWORK -
Through traveling on this expedition we hope to meet and establish a
global network of these innovators.</p>
<p>2. DOCUMENT POSITIVE
APPROACHES - Through documenting their stories with a general
audience in mind, our documentary will  tell stories of people
and communities tacking the issue. Our film will follow successes,
and  positive approaches - celebrating successful
campaigning as a way of getting people excited about being a part of
something and making it achievable.</p>
<p>3. GENERATE UK
PARTICIPATION - Building a UK movement through film screenings!
inspiring action within communities that would not normally be
involved in shark or marine conservation.</p>

<p> Fin Fighters are a new UK based shark and marine conservation organisation.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are a very ambitious! and have several large campaigns lined up for the next 5 years, most notably the Fin Free by 2023 campaign – which is working towards eradicating shark fin from the UK entirely by the year 2023. This would include a total ban on the trade and distribution of shark fin at a government level.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> We are
also working on a transparency campaign that would see fish and chip shops across
the UK stop the sale of shark, as well as a collaborative project
that is monitoring shark fisheries and working to establish catch
limits/sizes within the EU of various species of shark; including
deep sea sharks.</span><br/></p>

<p>Due to the efforts of our Fin Fighting community group (Fin Free Cambridge) in 2013 we achieved the miraculous! Cambridge became the UK's first city to officially condemn shark fin. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through lobbying the city council and petitioning the community we were able to secure the first ever backing of a council to protect sharks....which was HUGE!</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Fin Fighters promote co-operation, and we want to work with other groups to achieve change as dynamically and effectively as possible, to this effect we have recently worked with The Black Fish on a 3 week investigation in Morocco, to uncover potential illegal shark fishing as well as general monitoring of the shark fishery's along the coast. In this investigation Fin Fighters was able to take part in the citizen inspector network and trial techniques that will enable training of future Black Fish Citizen Inspectors.</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>We’ve set our goal at £20,000. You might be asking why such a low figure, surely this is no where near enough for a round the world expedition?</p>
<p>Well if we can, we would love to raise more than this because being a new organisation has its drawbacks.....most notably funding is very hard to come by! But there are a lot of things we’d like to do if we had the means, there’s no question about that.

THE ISSUE:

Our oceans are at the point of crisis; scientists have reported that in the last 50 years we have lost over 90%
of the global shark population due to overfishing and shark finning. Sharks as apex predators play a critical role in marine
ecosystems, and their decline is having catastrophic consequences.
By journeying around the world and documenting the story of the people who are actively tackling these issues, we hope to
create a tool that will be invaluable in inspiring the UK to join this growing conservation movement. 










OUR CAMPAIGN AIMS:
Communities and ordinary individuals around the world are leading the way in the movement to save sharks;
pushing for protection through the creation of marine reserves and shark fin bans, however awareness of this
critical issue in the UK is currently lacking and many people are apathetic.Our aims are three fold; Through this journey we hope to meet and establish a global network of these
innovators, the sum of who's work is collaboratively combating a difficult issue. Through documenting their stories we aim to raise vital awareness as well as promote positive attitudes;
celebrating successful campaigning as a way of getting people excited about being a part of something and
making it achievable.
Ultimately we want to generate this participation in the UK; to inspire and enable action within communities that
would not normally be involved in shark or marine conservation. Instead of making a film that focuses on the terrible issue of shark extinction; we aim to turn a story of disaster into a story of solutions by documenting the efforts of the pioneers tacking the problem!

Most vitally; these actions will protect sharks, which will in turn benefit the balance of global ecosystems,
which will benefit us all. 
                           


SUMMARY:
Our project has a three
part approach:
1. BUILD THE NETWORK -
Through traveling on this expedition we hope to meet and establish a
global network of these innovators.
2. DOCUMENT POSITIVE
APPROACHES - Through documenting their stories with a general
audience in mind, our documentary will  tell stories of people
and communities tacking the issue. Our film will follow successes,
and  positive approaches - celebrating successful
campaigning as a way of getting people excited about being a part of
something and making it achievable.
3. GENERATE UK
PARTICIPATION - Building a UK movement through film screenings!
inspiring action within communities that would not normally be
involved in shark or marine conservation.

     

WHY CONTRIBUTE?

By contributing your support to this project you will become a part of this movement for good, your support will enable us to complete this essential work and your participation will allow us to reach as many people as possible. Through this film - and through showing that change is possible, together we can inspire people to be involved and build a new generation of creative conservationists.
This project is not just about producing a film its about building a tool for a positive movement.
The magnitude of this project cannot be overstated; this will be beneficial to more than just the shark conservation movement, as it will empower communities to utilise their skills to generate positive change in many areas.




If you agree with the following, you'll love this project... 

You want to watch a film that portrays hope and a positive way forward for a difficult and little known issue that has massive impacts.
You want to help communities share their successful campaigns from around the world.
You believe that community is important.

WHO WE ARE:

 Fin Fighters are a new UK based shark and marine conservation organisation.
We are a very ambitious! and have several large campaigns lined up for the next 5 years, most notably the Fin Free by 2023 campaign – which is working towards eradicating shark fin from the UK entirely by the year 2023. This would include a total ban on the trade and distribution of shark fin at a government level.

 We are
also working on a transparency campaign that would see fish and chip shops across
the UK stop the sale of shark, as well as a collaborative project
that is monitoring shark fisheries and working to establish catch
limits/sizes within the EU of various species of shark; including
deep sea sharks.
CAMPAIGNS:
                                                         
     
Due to the efforts of our Fin Fighting community group (Fin Free Cambridge) in 2013 we achieved the miraculous! Cambridge became the UK's first city to officially condemn shark fin. Through lobbying the city council and petitioning the community we were able to secure the first ever backing of a council to protect sharks....which was HUGE!
                               
Fin Fighters promote co-operation, and we want to work with other groups to achieve change as dynamically and effectively as possible, to this effect we have recently worked with The Black Fish on a 3 week investigation in Morocco, to uncover potential illegal shark fishing as well as general monitoring of the shark fishery's along the coast. In this investigation Fin Fighters was able to take part in the citizen inspector network and trial techniques that will enable training of future Black Fish Citizen Inspectors.
TESTIMONIAL FROM WIETSE VAN DER WERF -DIRECTOR OF THE BLACK FISH:
""These passionate individuals are set on a course to make a profoundimpact on shark protection for the years to come. Securing the firstever backing of a local council in the UK, Cambridge turned fin freelast year. The campaign has since gone nationwide and we put our bets onthe Fin Fighter approach making the UK largely shark fin free within thedecade.""


""The coming years will see much needed ambition and action - forconservation of one of the world's most iconic species. Be at theforefront of protecting what is dear to this planet. Help protect sharksby helping build Fin Fighters into the force it needs to be.Working with Lou and Phil at Fin Fighters has been inspirational, funand simply productive. Stuff gets done when Fin Fighters are around. Ifyou are looking to support the type of organisation that gets stuck inand does whatever is necessary to protect this fragile earth for thegenerations to come - look no further. Fin Fighters are here. Getonboard, join or support. For the sharks - it’s now or never."" Wietse.

 We have not been around for long.....but we are making an impact!

Our work has also been featured in several conservation magazines; most notably the Ecologist, the Greenzine, and Schnews. 
WHAT IS OUR INDEGOGO GOAL?








We’ve set our goal at £20,000. You might be asking why such a low figure, surely this is no where near enough for a round the world expedition?
Well if we can, we would love to raise more than this because being a new organisation has its drawbacks.....most notably funding is very hard to come by! But there are a lot of things we’d like to do if we had the means, there’s no question about that. Any extra funding will enable us to not only make the best documentary we physically can, including more locations and more individuals to connect with, but it will allow us to have much more of an impact when we return and start to screen it.     



Your contribution will cover our filming expenses, help cover our production costs, and support our screening tour! We are also very committed to reducing the environmental impact of this project as much as possible, including offsetting where this is not possible.  Your contributions will not only help us meet our low environmental impact goal but will also ensure that the final film project is produced as ethically as possible.








We hope to travel to a variety of places on this expedition in order to connect with as many different people and cultures as possible, we believe that including approaches to saving/protecting sharks from as many places as we can we will help us build a stronger more unified message and a wider network will be created.
We will travel to shark hotspots in; Australia, China and
Indonesia, to the USA where in Florida and the Bahamas we will
meet scientists who are bravely bridging the gap between science and activism, to Hawaii where due to public
petitioning sharks have become protected, to Costa Rica; where one man is standing alone against illegal
finning and Canada where the Fin Free movement began.

<p></p>
<p><span>The People’s Platform, now known as the Solar Pioneer, is anchored in Elliott Bay just a thousand yards from Shell’s colossal Polar Pioneer.</span></p>
<p>On May 16th, we were at the center of the largest kayak-based protest in history, the Paddle in Seattle, to stop Shell from drilling in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Coast Salish canoes rafted up with us and indigenous speakers and performers rocked Shell to its core all day long.</p>
<p>Since then, <b>we’ve kept the Solar Pioneer out on the water for 3 weeks, projecting your messages to Shell and showing amazing documentaries that expose Shell's crimes all over the Earth.</b></p>
<p>We still have plenty more to project, including <b><i>Sweet Crude</i></b> and <b><i>Gasland</i></b>.</p>
<p>Incredible musicians have played the Solar Pioneer’s sound stage - with many more bands lined up in the wings.</p>
<p><b>We aim  to keep the Solar Pioneer in here in  Elliott Bay as long as Shell’s Arctic rigs are here. We only need 7 grand to make it happen.</b> Everything beyond that will go to making the Solar Pioneer rock even harder and supporting our awesome crew.!</p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Some of the most innovative engineers in the Pacific Northwest have helped us outfit the Solar Pioneer. Thanks to past fundraising, we've installed and are currently operating 27 solar panels to power the barge; we have also already covered the cost of our giant projector and other light show equipment, including a rocking sound system. </p>
<p>Our goal of $7,000 would keep the 4000 square foot Solar Pioneer out on the water in action against Shell for 2 more weeks. </p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, we will use whatever we do raise to keep the People's Platform out for as long as possible. If we exceed it, any funds not needed for the operation of the Solar Pioneer will go toward long-term movement-building in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

</div></div>","Look Out Shell! 

The People’s Platform, now known as the Solar Pioneer, is anchored in Elliott Bay just a thousand yards from Shell’s colossal Polar Pioneer.
On May 16th, we were at the center of the largest kayak-based protest in history, the Paddle in Seattle, to stop Shell from drilling in the Arctic.
Coast Salish canoes rafted up with us and indigenous speakers and performers rocked Shell to its core all day long.
Since then, we’ve kept the Solar Pioneer out on the water for 3 weeks, projecting your messages to Shell and showing amazing documentaries that expose Shell's crimes all over the Earth.
We still have plenty more to project, including Sweet Crude and Gasland.
Incredible musicians have played the Solar Pioneer’s sound stage - with many more bands lined up in the wings.
We aim  to keep the Solar Pioneer in here in  Elliott Bay as long as Shell’s Arctic rigs are here. We only need 7 grand to make it happen. Everything beyond that will go to making the Solar Pioneer rock even harder and supporting our awesome crew.!
Check out our schedule of events at MosquitoFleet.US. Thank you so much for being a part of this historic moment with us.





Perks
$5: DeckhandWelcome aboard! You'll be publicly listed on the Mosquito Fleet and Other 98% websites as an official crew-member of the People's Platform.
$10: Give Shell HellWe blast your personal message to Shell onto our giant projection screen. The shorter and pithier your message, the better. Example: ""SUCK it Shell! ...but not outta the Arctic."" Once you have made your contribution, send us a direct message on Indiegogo with some fresh hell for Shell.
$25: Mosquito Fleet Sticker
The Mosquito Fleet is a volunteer crew of kayaktivsts that are swarming against Global Warming in the Salish Sea. Get your sticker and fly the flag, mateys!!
$50: Mosquito Fleet T-ShirtThe Mosquito Fleet has formed to paddle Big Oil's dirty rigs and tankers out of the Seven Seas. Get your t-shirt and join the Fleet. Arrrrrgh!



$50: Solar Power to the People T-ShirtWhat the Hell Shell? Next time try solar.


$50: ShellNo T-ShirtThe ShellNo Kayak Flotilla captured the imaginations of people all over the world. Wear the symbol of a globally recognized movement. Snag a sweet t-shirt and let the world know how little you care for Shell.



$100: Mosquito Fleet HoodieLet the whole world know that you're rolling deep with the Mosquito Fleet.


$100: Solar Power HoodiePerfect for cool nights on the Solar Pioneer.





$250: First Mate's PackTake the clothes off our backs. You get both hoodies and two t-shirts.


$500: The Captain's PackGet 2 First Mate's Packs. You could donate them, give some away as gifts, or take a page from Shell and just keep them all for yourself. No judgement.



Budget
Some of the most innovative engineers in the Pacific Northwest have helped us outfit the Solar Pioneer. Thanks to past fundraising, we've installed and are currently operating 27 solar panels to power the barge; we have also already covered the cost of our giant projector and other light show equipment, including a rocking sound system. 
Our goal of $7,000 would keep the 4000 square foot Solar Pioneer out on the water in action against Shell for 2 more weeks. 
If we don't meet our goal, we will use whatever we do raise to keep the People's Platform out for as long as possible. If we exceed it, any funds not needed for the operation of the Solar Pioneer will go toward long-term movement-building in the Pacific Northwest.

This summer my friends and I decided to visit lake Seliger where we camped on the outskirts of a town called Ostashkov. We found out that the city is drowning in trash. So I came up with an idea of how to save it!I designed a simple solution for primary sorting at home - a trash bag that allows for sorting inside your regular trash bin.THE BILLBOARDThe concept of sorting isn't popular in Russia and this has to change. I decided to change that and in order to do so - I am seeking support of a world famous protector of the environment - Leonardo DiCaprio. If he likes my idea, everybody else will follow suit and Lake Seliger will become a clean place once again!To get Leo’s attention and explain my idea to him I plan to put up a billboard in LA, where he can actually see it. The billboard will contain a link to my website. This is going to cost $15000 and here is what its gonna look like:REWARDS:Your pledges are very important to help this project kick off! To show our gratitude we came up with several reward options and would like to present them to you:



STRETCH GOALS

Getting Leonardo to like my website will allow to get more coverage and therefore - more funding. If that happens, I plan to use that extra money to fund a full scale cleaning initiative in the city of Ostashkov and across all Russia.


Stretch goals include:
When we reach $20000 - educational billboards will be printed and put up in Ostashkov. Also, several lectures will be held in schools
Upon reaching $70000 we will commit to arranging at least 5 sorted waste collection points around Ostashkov.
Reaching $250000 will allow us to upgrade the equipment at the main sorting facility in Ostashkov to increase the output.
If we raise more than $500000 we will be able to launch our own “sorting-at-home” trashbag production line",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Pallas’s Fish Eagle</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pallas's Fish Eagle (<em>Haliaeetus leucoryphus</em>) is the most poorly studied eagle within the Northern Hemisphere.</strong> Virtually nothing is known about the species' non-breeding habitat requirements. Even worse, there has<em> never</em> been a study examining the seasonal movements of this elusive bird. Prior to the 1900’s, Pallas’s Fish Eagle were common throughout a large portion of Asia, extending west to east from the Caspian Sea to China, and north to south from Russia to India and Myanmar. Now, the species is extinct in Myanmar and along the Caspian Sea. The remaining population is classified as “globally vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Red List. Mongolia’s population is critically endangered with an estimated thirty breeding pairs in the entire country. Loss of habitat and prey, human disturbance, and agricultural chemicals are believed to be responsible for the severe drop in population over the past 100 years.</p>
<p><strong>The Expedition</strong></p>
<p>This January, myself and a group of local volunteers at the Pinjore Vulture Breeding Center will set out for Harike Barrage in Punjab, the northwest Indian state that shares a border with Pakistan. We will trap these elusive eagles with padded leg traps (tested on human fingers to avoid injuries to the bird) and birdlime, a sticky water-soluble substance placed on a bamboo pole near carcass bait. Birdlime is an effective technique used to capture the Pinjore Breeding Center’s endangered vultures. Upon capture, we will fit Pallas’s Fish Eagles with GPS-PTT Teflon ribbon backpacks designed to fall off after a few years. This will track the birds by Argos satellite systems and allow us to see their location <em>every two hours </em>with an accuracy of up to <em>10 m. </em></p>
<p>This following summer I will continue on to Mongolia to repeat the study with the northern population. Please continue to support us as we move on to the second part of the project (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/PFE-Mongolia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.indiegogo.com/PFE-Mongolia</a>).</p>
<p>The locations collected will allows us to finally understand when the Pallas’s Fish Eagles depart from their nest territories and where they spend the non-breeding season. <strong>You can be one of the first to unravel this mystery alongside dedicated researchers from around the world.</strong></p>
<p>To acomplish this expedition, we need your help. <strong>Each satellite unit costs $4,000.00 and a year of ARGOS data collection is ~$1,000.00 a year per unit.</strong> Our goal is to have a minimum of two transmitters for India and two transmitters for Mongolia. However, the more backpacks we have, the more we'll learn. Additional expenses incurred will also include international travel, in-country travel, trapping materials, and backpack materials. <strong>Your support for this project is crucial to its success!</strong> Learn alongside us as we explore the Northern Hemisphere's least understood eagle species!<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Researchers</strong></p>
<p> My name is Marla Steele, a doctoral student majoring in Biology at the University of Arkansas. I am conducting an exciting project under the supervision of Dr. Sundev Gombobaatar (Director of the Mongolian Ornithological Society and head of the Ornithology Lab at the National University of Mongolia) and Dr. Vibhu Prakash (Director of the Pinjore Vulture Breeding Center and former Principal Scientist for the Bombay Natural History Society).</p>
<p><em>Raptors of the World </em>by James Ferguson-Lees and David Christie initially inspired my interests in this majestic bird. While reading the section on Pallas’s Fish Eagle, I came across something I had never seen before: <em>a home range map covered in question marks</em>. The more I tried to uncover regarding this unusual lack of information, the more apparent it became that this bird remains misunderstood. Its population is dropping at an alarming rate. Unfortunately, <strong>we cannot develop an effective conservation plan because we do not even know where it migrates to six months out of the year</strong>.</p>
<p>With a new sense of purpose, I contacted my Dr. Sundev Gombobaatar (Dr. Gomboo), whom I met while presenting my undergraduate research on Japanese raptor migration at the Asian Raptor Research and Conservation (ARRCN) meeting in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. He fully supported my interests and we began to plan the study. Upon further reading, I realized that the eagles in the Mongolia and India breed at completely opposite times of the year. Dr. Gomboo and I concluded that the Indian eagles might be a completely separate population with their own unique breeding and migration habits. In order to understand these perplexing differences, we needed help.</p>
<p> Last January, I completed a few initial surveys of protected national parks in India for Pallas’s Fish Eagles while establishing relations with the park managers. This allowed me to receive permission to enter protected habitat that was inaccessible to the general public and increase awareness of the eagles’ plight. I also met with the Director of the Pinjore Vulture Breeding Center and former Principal Scientist of the Bombay Natural History Society (One of India’s oldest, publishing scientific societies) Dr. Vibhu Prakash. Dr. Prakash studied Indian raptor habitat requirements and Pallas’s Fish Eagle were one of his study species. Upon hearing our proposal, Dr. Prakash agreed to work with us on behalf of the Bombay Natural History Society, thus providing the final integral link to the project.

Recently a neighbor complained because we have pit bulls. The local shelter came out and told us that we have to get everything up to code and get rid of most of the dogs or they would seize them.<br/><br/> Now our local shelter kills 71% of everything that comes thru the door. Especially pit bulls. So we have been trying our best to get the dogs adopted out or sent to other rescues. This has raised alot of unexpected expenses. On top of that I was hurt in an accident recently which left me bedridden for awhile and unable to work. We have rarely gotten any donations in these last 2 years and done most everything out of pocket. <br/><br/>Now we are desperate. We have nothing left and are losing our home. If we lose our home before we can get these dogs adopted out they will go to Memphis Animal Shelter and be euthanized.<br/><br/>I have raised these dogs, some of them from puppies, I have nursed their wounds, held them when they were scared, taught them to trust humans again, and mended their broken hearts. I would do anything to keep them from being taken to the pound. <br/><br/>We need $3000 to pay off the mortgage and make the necessary repairs to our home and yard to buy these dogs some time. Because if we are homeless, so are they, and we can't help them if we have nowhere for them to go. <br/><br/>Please, please help if you can. Every dollar, every cent helps more than you could ever know and more than I could ever put into words. </p></div>","2 Years ago my husband and I started a dog rescue.

The local shelter came out and told us that we have to get everything up to code and get rid of most of the dogs or they would seize them. Now our local shelter kills 71% of everything that comes thru the door. Especially pit bulls. So we have been trying our best to get the dogs adopted out or sent to other rescues. This has raised alot of unexpected expenses. On top of that I was hurt in an accident recently which left me bedridden for awhile and unable to work. We have rarely gotten any donations in these last 2 years and done most everything out of pocket. Now we are desperate. We have nothing left and are losing our home. If we lose our home before we can get these dogs adopted out they will go to Memphis Animal Shelter and be euthanized.I have raised these dogs, some of them from puppies, I have nursed their wounds, held them when they were scared, taught them to trust humans again, and mended their broken hearts. I would do anything to keep them from being taken to the pound. We need $3000 to pay off the mortgage and make the necessary repairs to our home and yard to buy these dogs some time. Because if we are homeless, so are they, and we can't help them if we have nowhere for them to go. Please, please help if you can. Every dollar, every cent helps more than you could ever know and more than I could ever put into words.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Flexiway Solar: our Story</h3>
Flexiway Solar Solutions is a bootstrapped company started by 3 people who wanted to help people in Africa &amp; Asia as well as our environment. We found that for over 1.5 billion people in developing countries depend on kerosene for lighting purposes and up to 30% of family income is used to pay for it, while these lights are the major cause of health fires &amp; health problems and cause environmental damage.<br/><br/>From the beginning our goal has been to develop a simple, durable light that should cost $8 or less in developing countries and therefore <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">can be earned back within one month of kerosene savings</span>. The lights last at least 3 years and have replaceable rechargeable AAA batteries (included). After changing these the lights can work for many years more.<br/><br/>Our light exists, has been in the field for years and has had a huge positive impact; now we are ready for the next steps.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact &amp; change</h3>
<p>Thousands of our lights have been produced and were used in the field for over 2 years and the impact and results are astounding. Children no longer have headaches and have improved their test scores, while their parents save 25-30% on their household costs and tons of CO2 were saved. </p>
<p>Women and children in a refugee camp felt safe at night and had time and light to relax and play. See <a href=""http://flexiwaysolar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Flexiway Solar Solutions"">the website</a> and the video above for <a href=""http://flexiwaysolar.com/about-us/our-vision/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Our vision and 10 problems our lights solves"">the 10 major positive impacts our light is making</a>. </p>
<h3>Version 2 of our light and our company: a new light, bigger plans to help out</h3>
We have incorporated all feedback and designed an even <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">improved light</span>which we are producing right now. This light will change many people's lives and the first 3000 have already been received by an Australian NGO to be distributed in Papua New Guinea.

We prefer to work with NGO's as they have local knowledge, low overhead costs and we provide them the lights against the lowest costs possible; this is the cornerstone of our company.<br/><br/>We think big and our next project is focused on helping an entire country getting rid of kerosene lamps. Rwanda has been the victim of a brutal civil war and we want to help the people get back on their feet by supplying them all with affordable solar-powered lights. Some will be donated to the poorest, other will be sold directly or through Micro Credits.<br/>Meanwhile our lights are also distributed in other developing countries and as the lights are so extremely useful, will now be sold to the western market as well.<br/><h3>We present: The Solar Muscle: unlimited smart light for everybody</h3>

Contexte
Oui Canada a été fondée par le One Earth Initiative Society pour encourager le leadership canadien lors de la Conférences des Nations Unies pour le développement durable, ou le Sommet de la Terre 2012, qui aura lieu à Rio de Janeiro en juin 2012. Oui Canada est une initiative menée par plus de 50 bénévoles et soutenue par la Coalition canadienne pour le Sommet de la Terre, un regroupement d’organisations non-gouvernementales (ONG), de groupes universitaires, de groupes de recherche et de groupes académiques qui travaillent tous pour promouvoir l’écologie, une économie durable et la justice sociale.

La Conférence des Nations Unies pour le développement durable (CNUDD)
La Conférence des Nations Unies pour le développement durable aura lieu en juin 2012 à Rio de Janeiro, au Brésil. La conférence est aussi la commémoration du 20e anniversaire de la Conférence des Nations Unies sur l’environnement et le développement qui a eu lieu à Rio en 1992 et connue comme le Sommet de la Terre de Rio.

Le Sommet de la Terre de Rio fut l’un des plus grands rassemblements de chefs d’États, de dirigeants de la société civile, d’individus et d’organismes de l’histoire humaine. Ces parties-prenantes se sont réunis avec l’objectif de créer un plan d’action pour un avenir durable. Du Sommet ont émergé des ententes, notamment Action 21, contribuant à la création d’un cadre pour le développement de plans mondiaux, nationaux et régionaux pour le développement durable. Depuis, le Sommet de la Terre de Rio est demeuré un exemple de ce qui est possible lorsque les gouvernements et la société civile travaillent de concert.

Pourquoi un leadership canadien? Pourquoi maintenant?
Durant cette époque économique difficile, notre attention collective semble s’être déplacée à l’écart des soucis environnementaux et sociaux. Le gouvernement du Canada a saisi cette occasion pour mettre les questions environnementales, climatiques et de justice sociale en veilleuse malgré le fait que plusieurs Canadiens et Canadiennes aient démontré se soucier de ces questions. Le développement durable est plus que la protection environnementale; c’est aussi à propos de créer des emplois verts significatifs et durables.

Notre gouvernement n’a pas encore mené de consultations avec les Canadiens et les Canadiennes pour qu’ils suggèrent ce que la position de notre pays devrait être au Sommet de la Terre 2012. Ceci est retourner un pas en arrière par rapport aux louanges que le Canada a autrefois reçu en tant que dirigeant mondial de la démocratie. Les voix des Canadiens et des Canadiennes doivent retourner au premier plan. Comment imaginons-nous notre avenir?

Oui Canada, c’est quoi?
Oui Canada, c’est aller de l'avant alors que le gouvernement va à reculons. Nous voulons disséminer des connaissances et donner le pouvoir aux gens pour qu’ils fassent un changement dans leur propre vie. Nous encouragerons le dialogue et les consultations parmi le public, des réseaux d’entreprises responsables et les ONGs. Nous avons créé une coalition nationale de la société civile et nous développons des relations avec de similaires initiatives dans d’autres pays. Nous voulons faire du Sommet de la Terre 2012 un moment charnière pour le mouvement du développement durable.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p><b><b>Investigating matrifocal ways of social organisation (in humans and Elephants) as a means to discover principles that could contribute to a philosophy of Eco-Civilisation.</b><br/></b></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><u>Summary</u></p>Since December 2013, as an honorary research fellow at OASES graduate school, I have been undertaking research in the field of Eco-civilisation. This work led me to investigate my own community in Kerala, South India and my ancestry to understand their relationship with Earth.  <div>To my astonishment, I discovered a rich heritage of matriarchal clan living with sacred snake groves, Goddess worship, gender equality and a close relationship to elephants. A form of this way of living was practised by my ancestors up until the 1920s in Kerala.  Elephants in particular, with their matriarchal clan living, are important and have a formidable presence in the lives of people living along the Western Ghats of South India.<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">With my research in Eco-Civilisation, I am trying to find principles for '<i>a</i> </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">social formation, consistent with the repair and ongoing renewal of the biosphere'. </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I believe that Matrifocal forms of social organisation are significant with their unique gender relations and deep engagement with the greater living system; the Earth herself.  </span><br/>

<p><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">1) Document living memories of my own ancestors, and also of other matrifocal communities in Kerala and along the Western Ghats.</span><br/></b></p>
<p><b>2) Investigate and record folk-tales, rituals, and other clues that might exist today that might be able to throw light on past ways of matrifocal kinship.</b></p>
<p><b>3) Liaise with ecologists working with Asian elephants in these areas to learn about records of particular clan behaviour and matrifocal kinship among elephants in the area.</b></p>
<p><b>4) Liaise with researchers in Kerala working in this field.</b></p>
<p><b>5) Source relevant books and materials in Malayalam.</b></p>
<p><b>6) Employ auto-ethnographic and embodied methods of qualitative research while on the field-trip to record my own journey to claim my ancestry and my inheritance of power.</b></p>Owing to my ancestral heritage of matrifocal kinship and the geographical location of my ancestral land in the vicinity of the Western Ghats, which is also home to other matrifocal human as well as elephant communities, the focus of my research will be geographically limited to the Western Ghats of India. This gives me the advantage of familiarity and connections to locals in the area.  Further, proficiency in my mother tongue, Malayalam, gives me the privilege of undertaking bilingual research, sourcing materials written in Malayalam and conducting interviews.  Also, access to sacred places, including temples, allows me to record the matrifocal elements with ecological relevance still practised today in the form of rituals, ceremonies and sacred rites.<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why is this important?</b></p>
<p>The journey so far has been challenging as I learn more about my own heritage and try to understand it’s implications for the world and myself. I have come to realise that this knowledge is not only important for me, but is also very relevant for the world. The reason I started this work was to look for old ways of being that could be recovered and made meaningful in our modern context. As capitalism blurs our vision and blunts our moral and ethical sensibilities, it becomes harder and harder to know how to be in this world. It is important in this conjuncture to explore ways of being together, as a society, to consider steps for moving forward. This is something we forget as we run around trying to come up with political, social and technological solutions to our global problems.</p>
<p>Matrifocal ways of living have been practised by humans and animals for a very long time; Whales and Elephants are mammalian examples while Humans and Bonobos are examples of apes<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn15"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[15]</a>. In this era of globalisation, where cultural identities and boundaries are dissolving, humans are in a position to choose how to be in this world and how to relate to Earth. This research will provide a glimpse in to one way of living and relating that has been abandoned by most humans, but still practised by non-human apes and other mammals. I believe that there are important lessons to be learned that could be made meaningful in our modern context; this will provide one strand of a rope that we, as humans, can use to climb out of the mess we have created for ourselves. I believe what I have stumbled on with my work can be an invaluable resource and an important addition to the growing theory of Eco- civilisation.</p>

<p><b>Why I need your support</b></p>
<p>As an honorary research fellow at OASES Graduate School, Melbourne, I have been researching this topic in my own time. I have had incredible support from OASES, without which this work might not have come this far. However, OASES Graduate School is not in a position to fund my field-trip; They are a not-for-profit organisation already stretching their resources to do all the good that they are currently doing in this world. </p>
<p>Because of my VISA situation, I will be considered an International student if I were to apply for a PHD at any university in Australia. This means that I will have to pay $22,000 per year as an International student. I am not in a financial situation to afford this. I have been told that scholarships for International students who already live and work in Australia, especially in the field of Environmental Philosophy, is hard to come by. This left me in a challenging situation at the end of 2013, having to decide between waiting two years for my VISA situation to change or undertake the research independently with institutional support from OASES Graduate School. I chose the latter as it is very clear to me that this research gives meaning to my life and purpose to my time. </p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, I have come to a point where I need to go to Kerala to continue my research . This crowd-funding campaign is to raise funds for this field-trip. I have tried getting support through grants from institutions such as the Australia-India Council, but did not meet the eligibility criteria as I am not an Australian Permanent Resident and also because they expect research institutions to fund projects like this. As an immigrant, I also fall through the cracks of most grant-programs that are set up for this sort of research. Being an international student is not an option I can follow even if I decide to borrow money from the bank as Australian Banks do not give loans to immigrants who are not permanent residents. </p>
<p>Having exhausted all my options I have turned to crowd funding. I do this with the courage that this work has given me and through the conviction that what I am doing is important not only for me, but also for the world. I hope that you are able to see this, that you are moved by my story so far, and that you are inspired to support me through the next leg of my journey.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading my story and for your consideration to support this project.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Research Background</b></p>
<p>Since December 2013, as an honorary research fellow at OASES Graduate School, I have been undertaking research in the field of Eco-civilisation. What drew me to undertake this research was Freya Matthews’ work on philosophy of bio-mimicry<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> and theory of Eco-civilisation.</p>
<p>Freya Matthews (2013)<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[2]</a> defines ‘Eco-Civilization’, as a ‘<i>social formation, consistent with the repair and ongoing renewal of the biosphere.’  </i>She also states that an inter-civilisational dialogue will be <i>‘key in the discovery of cultural and philosophical foundations for Eco-Civilisation in the west.’</i></p>
<p>Old civilisations of the world, whose philosophies of their engagement with the living Universe were developed far before industrialisation may still hold clues to principles of biomimetic engagement with the universe. These principles, when recovered, could be used to lay the foundational philosophy for an Eco-Civilisation. This requires an inter-civilisational dialogue - to remember and renovate old ideas in new forms that will contribute to a re-awakening of human civilisations through a re-engagement with the living Universe, each through their own unique narratives, yet, together in their goal of Eco-Civilisation.</p>
<p>I wanted to respond to Freya's call for an inter-civilisational dialogue by contributing to this idea of Eco-Civilisation using my background of Indian civilisation.</p>
<p>At the onset of my research, I wanted to look at Indian philosophy to tease out principles that might contribute to an Eco-Civilisation. But it soon became too large and too complex a task to undertake. ‘Indian Philosophy’ encompasses many different philosophies, and Hinduism is a constantly renewing process and can only be called a way of living that changes according to geographic locations, historical migrations and political interventions.</p>
<p>In order to find a grounding point in this revolving chaos that I found myself in, and with invaluable guidance form my supervisors, Freya Matthews and Jacque Boulet, I began to look in to my own ancestry. This was my way into a particular component of Indian philosophy, investigating what particular philosophy influenced my ancestors, what was their relationship with nature, and to see what principles, if any, could be applicable to an Eco-Civilisation in the modern context.</p>
<p>This has turned out to be the most challenging, meaningful and rewarding work that I have ever done. As I began to investigate my own community from Kerala I found out facts that not only astonished me, but also challenged what I knew about this world and who I knew myself to be in this world.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Cultural Background</b></p>
<p>I belong to a caste/community called ‘Nair’ from Kerala.  Kerala is bounded by the sea on one side and a mountain range called Western Ghats on the other<i>. </i>Growing up, I knew that my community used to be matrilineal and I understood this to mean that women of the family inherited land and had rights to property. I was never given any indication that it meant anything else. Nor did my immediate family structure or circumstances give any clues to a different past. </p>
<p>I grew up in a conservative and patriarchal household, though modern in its outlook. My parents had accepted modernity with gusto to bring up two daughters, with conservatism liberally sprinkled in for ‘our protection’. We were allowed a long leash, and we experienced more freedom than most of our counterparts. We knew we were lucky to have parents who did not restrict us from doing what we wanted just because we were girls. We were taught values of love, kindness, generosity and family.</p>
<p> I was brought up to understand that as a woman, my agency comes from being like a man and ‘making it’ in life.  I believed that education and a ‘good’ career will prove that I am equal. I also understood early on that as a girl, fear will be my constant companion along with shame. I learnt that I have to cover my body in-order to protect myself and that ‘good girls’ don’t have boy-friends. All through adolescence and early adulthood, I was ridden with guilt for being ‘bad’ in many different ways, from having boyfriends to asking too many questions. My life then was a constant struggle to hide my ‘bad-ness’ from my family and society in general. For years I went round and round in confused masochistic circles, trying to make sense of it all. </p>
<p>It was a long and arduous journey for me to recognise the power within myself, as an individual and as a woman. I had blamed, for a large part, my cultural background for my feelings of powerless-less as a woman. My life in India was ridden with instances and stories of marital violence, abuse, rape and girl-child marriages. It seemed to me that if you were born in to that cultural context, you were doomed to a life of servitude, unless you fight tooth and nail to get out of it, somehow.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Research findings, so far</b></p>
<p><u>My Ancestors</u></p>
<p>Through my research during the last six months, I have learned that most of what I considered to be my cultural tradition is, in fact, only a few generations old, created by the influence of patriarchal Brahmanism, colonial law, and more recently, modernity through western development.</p>
<p>I have learned that my real cultural inheritance is not one of servitude, but one of incredible power. My research took me to a world of matriarchal clan living<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[3]</a>, where women made decisions not only about their own lives, but also for the whole clan. It took me to a world were women had lovers, not husbands<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[4]</a>; where women, dressed the same as men and lived in an egalitarian clan structure in which men and women were equals<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[5]</a>. I have learned that equality for women is not a modern concept. There were communities that practised equality in deeper ways than what we experience in our society today<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[6]</a>; and that I belong to one such community.</p>
<p>I was shocked and felt betrayed by society. “Why didn’t anyone tell me??” In High School, we had two large history text books on the Second World War. I had to memorise who defeated whom in battles that ancient kings of India engaged in for no particular reason. Yet, all through school, university, and most of my life, I was ignorant about the history of my own people.  What shocked me most was the fact that a form of this matriarchal way of living was practised up until 1920s<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[7]</a> - This was how my great-great grandmother lived.  It was challenging to reconcile with that fact that everything could be forgotten in just four generations; a period of time in which a whole community of women were displaced, from a position of power to that of servitude and shame.</p>
<p>As I investigated further, I began to uncover the depth of meaning of rituals and ceremonies that the Nair community still practise, remnants of more elaborate rituals from the past; most of which served to maintain the close relationship they had with the Earth. Nair clan houses always had a part of their property set aside as sacred groves. They also looked after temple elephants. I began to understand the relevance of stories and instances from my childhood with this perspective of ancient history and mythology.</p>
<p>Every clan house looked after ecologically significant sacred groves that housed many snakes. The oldest woman of the clan maintained a sacred relationship with the snakes and was the priestess of the sacred grove. <i>Although I don’t remember a sacred grove in the house I grew up, I remember that snakes had a constant presence in my childhood, brushing against my feet as I played among the mango trees.  I remember distinctly being told that if I ever chance upon a mating ritual of snakes, I should not disturb them, nor should I stare. I was told that it was their sacred rite and I should respect their privacy.</i></p>
<p>A typical clan house had several sacred rooms, which housed the clan goddess (<i>Bhagavati and/or Badrakali</i>) as well as figures representing their ancestors<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[8]</a>. Goddesses worship is still very strong in Kerala, with many goddess temples still preserving ecologically significant scared groves. <i>The kindergarten I attended was inside a small Durga temple that had a sacred grove for the Snake gods. As we played hide-and-seek inside the sacred grove, presence of the fierce goddess felt comforting to my little heart that beat a little too fast with the fear of snakes. As my friend counted to ten with her eyes closed, I would always look up to the sky to spot the Eagle gods, cousins and rivals of Snake Gods, to say a small prayer for extra protection before venturing into the scared grove to hide.  </i></p>
<p>Nair men had a special relationship with temple elephants; folktales of this elephant-human friendship have been collected and published across Kerala. <i>I remember my grandfather’s fondness for temple elephants, and was fortunate enough to have young temple elephants as playmates for many summers of my childhood. They would come for ten days every year, during the temple festival. We fed them giant rice balls filled with jaggery (palm sugar). I remember rough skin, soft pink tongue, beautiful long eye lashes; tenderness with which they picked me up, giant trunks wound around my small thin body.  </i></p>
<p>There are other communities in Kerala that used to practise matrifocal<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[9]</a> kinship. These are mainly the <i>Parayans</i> and the <i>Pulayans</i>, who were subjugated by the warrior-like Nairs and later became slaves and untouchables in the caste hierarchy that was forced by patriarchal Brahmin invaders<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn10"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[10]</a>. With great pain, I have to own up to the unimaginable violence that my ancestors had unleashed upon these communities; it included bonded labour, violence, rape and even beheadings for trivial matters such as crossing the path a Nair man was walking on. This serves as my grounding point in reminding me not to idealise the past. It also, more importantly, makes it crucial for me to investigate and document matrifocal kinship in these communities and their relationship to nature.</p>
<p><u>Western Ghats and Elephants</u></p>
<p>The geographical location of these communities, including that of my ancestors, is a dominant feature that cannot be ignored. Even today, the rainforests along the Western Ghats and the mountain range itself has a formidable presence in the life of people of Kerala, and to some extend in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra where it spills over in to these states. It served as a protective barrier during different eras of colonisation and also helped preserve the unique cultural identity of the communities that lived here. Matrifocal elements have been recorded in communities all along the Western Ghats, with strong matrifocal regions in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[11]</a>. Another interesting feature of this geographical location is the ecological significance of the place itself.  The Western Ghats, a UNESCO world heritage listed site, is one of the ‘eight ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity in the world’<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn12"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[12]</a>. The world’s single largest population of Asian Elephants live here. Encounters with wild Elephants are common occurrences in many parts of the Western Ghats; they are a part of everyday life that children going to school or women going to work have have to be wary of. </p>
<p>Communities living here have co-existed with Elephants, wild and tame, for centuries. This relationship has become strained in recent times with shrinking forests, increasing human population and encroaching development.  Human-Elephant conflict in the Western Ghats is an issue that has resulted in many fatalities, both of Elephants and humans in the recent past<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn13"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[13]</a>.  This strong presence of Elephants in the lives of these communities is a fact that has special significance for my research when viewed from the perspective of matrifocal social organisation. Elephants live in matriarchal clans; matriarchal kin-ship amongst both Asian and African Elephants is well documented<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/eco-civilisation-research-project/edit/#_ftn14"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[14]</a>. This has led me to look at matrifocal kinship amongst Asian elephants as a non-human version of this particular type of social organisation.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>Next Steps</b>
</div>
<div>
<p>As I spent more time on this research, I realised that it is now a very important part of my life.  Managing a couple of part time jobs and volunteering for few organisations has meant that it has taken a while - in fact six months - to reach where I am at the moment. I also do not have access to online journals or libraries other than the OASES libraries (which are great resources). This has meant that I have had to spend days in libraries, and lately most of my spare time, trying to find as much written material as available on this topic. As much as this has helped me to build theoretical groundwork, I find myself lacking in resources to continue this research. I have also found many references of relevant books and articles written in Malayalam. Apart from a few articles that I found online, most of these are currently out of my reach simply because they are not available to me here in Melbourne. I have realised that I have reached a stage where I need to go to Kerala to continue this work.</p>
<p>On a personal level, this work has had a deep impact on me and has consumed my mind, my thoughts and my dreams. It has become difficult to continue with my everyday life, as it feels disjointed from the thoughts that occupy my mind most of the time. Conversations with my mother about what she remembers, which is not much; passing on questions to great aunts who remember a lot; thinking of my great grand-mother, Lakshmi-Kutty Amma, my namesake; wondering about a sacred grove in our ancestral home that I have just come to know about; discussions with my sister about our grandmother, who seemed to have remembered in her body even if not in her conscious mind. Conversations with my great aunts have convinced me that I need to record their memories before it is too late. They represent my last link to a culture that is on the verge of disappearing forever. I have realised that I need to be physically present in the place to bring some calm to the storm that is in my mind and my heart. I need to touch the earth of my homeland, feel the weight of the humid air and drink the sweet water from the well in my ancestral home. I need to claim my ancestry. </p>
<p>For these reasons, I have decided that the next step in my research journey is to visit Kerala.</p>

In examining the philosophy of Bio-mimicry, Freya Matthews
(2011) argues that the proponents of the science of Bio-mimicry are not taking
their questions far enough. She questions the very method of seeking a
biomimetic means to our consumer ends. She claims that we could question of our
ends, [or our wants]- Could they be bio-mimetic? She argues that a truly
sustainable world could philosophically be a bio-mimetic one, where there is
‘an entire culture of engagement’..[with the Universe].. ‘whereby our sense of
our own meaning is suffused with the meanings of …[this living Universe]’. She
warns ‘<i>it is crucial to address the
question of what the life system wants us to want if we wish to achieve
environmental sustainability, because in the longer term we simply will not be
able to devise means which systematically nourish the greater life-system
unless our ends are cross-referenced to the ends of the other elements of that
system.’</i> She points out that this <i>engagement</i>
or <i>cross-referencing of ends</i> happens
in a <i>synergistic</i> mode. Principles of
this bio-mimetic engagement within a synergistic mode could be used to develop
the foundational philosophy for an Eco-Civilisation. Freya Mathews (2011)
identifies two such principles: 1) The principle of <i>conativity</i> 2) The principle of least resistance. The Daoist
category of Wu-Wei is an example of the latter principle of least- resistance.

</div></div>","Investigating matrifocal ways of social organisation (in humans and Elephants) as a means to discover principles that could contribute to a philosophy of Eco-Civilisation.SummarySince December 2013, as an honorary research fellow at OASES graduate school, I have been undertaking research in the field of Eco-civilisation. This work led me to investigate my own community in Kerala, South India and my ancestry to understand their relationship with Earth.  To my astonishment, I discovered a rich heritage of matriarchal clan living with sacred snake groves, Goddess worship, gender equality and a close relationship to elephants. A form of this way of living was practised by my ancestors up until the 1920s in Kerala.  Elephants in particular, with their matriarchal clan living, are important and have a formidable presence in the lives of people living along the Western Ghats of South India.
With my research in Eco-Civilisation, I am trying to find principles for 'a social formation, consistent with the repair and ongoing renewal of the biosphere'. I believe that Matrifocal forms of social organisation are significant with their unique gender relations and deep engagement with the greater living system; the Earth herself.  


This Crowd-funding appeal is for a field trip to South India to:

1) Document living memories of my own ancestors, and also of other matrifocal communities in Kerala and along the Western Ghats.
2) Investigate and record folk-tales, rituals, and other clues that might exist today that might be able to throw light on past ways of matrifocal kinship.
3) Liaise with ecologists working with Asian elephants in these areas to learn about records of particular clan behaviour and matrifocal kinship among elephants in the area.
4) Liaise with researchers in Kerala working in this field.
5) Source relevant books and materials in Malayalam.
6) Employ auto-ethnographic and embodied methods of qualitative research while on the field-trip to record my own journey to claim my ancestry and my inheritance of power.Owing to my ancestral heritage of matrifocal kinship and the geographical location of my ancestral land in the vicinity of the Western Ghats, which is also home to other matrifocal human as well as elephant communities, the focus of my research will be geographically limited to the Western Ghats of India. This gives me the advantage of familiarity and connections to locals in the area.  Further, proficiency in my mother tongue, Malayalam, gives me the privilege of undertaking bilingual research, sourcing materials written in Malayalam and conducting interviews.  Also, access to sacred places, including temples, allows me to record the matrifocal elements with ecological relevance still practised today in the form of rituals, ceremonies and sacred rites.

Why is this important?
The journey so far has been challenging as I learn more about my own heritage and try to understand it’s implications for the world and myself. I have come to realise that this knowledge is not only important for me, but is also very relevant for the world. The reason I started this work was to look for old ways of being that could be recovered and made meaningful in our modern context. As capitalism blurs our vision and blunts our moral and ethical sensibilities, it becomes harder and harder to know how to be in this world. It is important in this conjuncture to explore ways of being together, as a society, to consider steps for moving forward. This is something we forget as we run around trying to come up with political, social and technological solutions to our global problems.
Matrifocal ways of living have been practised by humans and animals for a very long time; Whales and Elephants are mammalian examples while Humans and Bonobos are examples of apes[15]. In this era of globalisation, where cultural identities and boundaries are dissolving, humans are in a position to choose how to be in this world and how to relate to Earth. This research will provide a glimpse in to one way of living and relating that has been abandoned by most humans, but still practised by non-human apes and other mammals. I believe that there are important lessons to be learned that could be made meaningful in our modern context; this will provide one strand of a rope that we, as humans, can use to climb out of the mess we have created for ourselves. I believe what I have stumbled on with my work can be an invaluable resource and an important addition to the growing theory of Eco- civilisation.


Why I need your support
As an honorary research fellow at OASES Graduate School, Melbourne, I have been researching this topic in my own time. I have had incredible support from OASES, without which this work might not have come this far. However, OASES Graduate School is not in a position to fund my field-trip; They are a not-for-profit organisation already stretching their resources to do all the good that they are currently doing in this world. 
Because of my VISA situation, I will be considered an International student if I were to apply for a PHD at any university in Australia. This means that I will have to pay $22,000 per year as an International student. I am not in a financial situation to afford this. I have been told that scholarships for International students who already live and work in Australia, especially in the field of Environmental Philosophy, is hard to come by. This left me in a challenging situation at the end of 2013, having to decide between waiting two years for my VISA situation to change or undertake the research independently with institutional support from OASES Graduate School. I chose the latter as it is very clear to me that this research gives meaning to my life and purpose to my time. 
As mentioned earlier, I have come to a point where I need to go to Kerala to continue my research . This crowd-funding campaign is to raise funds for this field-trip. I have tried getting support through grants from institutions such as the Australia-India Council, but did not meet the eligibility criteria as I am not an Australian Permanent Resident and also because they expect research institutions to fund projects like this. As an immigrant, I also fall through the cracks of most grant-programs that are set up for this sort of research. Being an international student is not an option I can follow even if I decide to borrow money from the bank as Australian Banks do not give loans to immigrants who are not permanent residents. 
Having exhausted all my options I have turned to crowd funding. I do this with the courage that this work has given me and through the conviction that what I am doing is important not only for me, but also for the world. I hope that you are able to see this, that you are moved by my story so far, and that you are inspired to support me through the next leg of my journey.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading my story and for your consideration to support this project.


Research Background
Since December 2013, as an honorary research fellow at OASES Graduate School, I have been undertaking research in the field of Eco-civilisation. What drew me to undertake this research was Freya Matthews’ work on philosophy of bio-mimicry[1] and theory of Eco-civilisation.
Freya Matthews (2013)[2] defines ‘Eco-Civilization’, as a ‘social formation, consistent with the repair and ongoing renewal of the biosphere.’  She also states that an inter-civilisational dialogue will be ‘key in the discovery of cultural and philosophical foundations for Eco-Civilisation in the west.’
Old civilisations of the world, whose philosophies of their engagement with the living Universe were developed far before industrialisation may still hold clues to principles of biomimetic engagement with the universe. These principles, when recovered, could be used to lay the foundational philosophy for an Eco-Civilisation. This requires an inter-civilisational dialogue - to remember and renovate old ideas in new forms that will contribute to a re-awakening of human civilisations through a re-engagement with the living Universe, each through their own unique narratives, yet, together in their goal of Eco-Civilisation.
I wanted to respond to Freya's call for an inter-civilisational dialogue by contributing to this idea of Eco-Civilisation using my background of Indian civilisation.
At the onset of my research, I wanted to look at Indian philosophy to tease out principles that might contribute to an Eco-Civilisation. But it soon became too large and too complex a task to undertake. ‘Indian Philosophy’ encompasses many different philosophies, and Hinduism is a constantly renewing process and can only be called a way of living that changes according to geographic locations, historical migrations and political interventions.
In order to find a grounding point in this revolving chaos that I found myself in, and with invaluable guidance form my supervisors, Freya Matthews and Jacque Boulet, I began to look in to my own ancestry. This was my way into a particular component of Indian philosophy, investigating what particular philosophy influenced my ancestors, what was their relationship with nature, and to see what principles, if any, could be applicable to an Eco-Civilisation in the modern context.
This has turned out to be the most challenging, meaningful and rewarding work that I have ever done. As I began to investigate my own community from Kerala I found out facts that not only astonished me, but also challenged what I knew about this world and who I knew myself to be in this world.

Cultural Background
I belong to a caste/community called ‘Nair’ from Kerala.  Kerala is bounded by the sea on one side and a mountain range called Western Ghats on the other. Growing up, I knew that my community used to be matrilineal and I understood this to mean that women of the family inherited land and had rights to property. I was never given any indication that it meant anything else. Nor did my immediate family structure or circumstances give any clues to a different past. 
I grew up in a conservative and patriarchal household, though modern in its outlook. My parents had accepted modernity with gusto to bring up two daughters, with conservatism liberally sprinkled in for ‘our protection’. We were allowed a long leash, and we experienced more freedom than most of our counterparts. We knew we were lucky to have parents who did not restrict us from doing what we wanted just because we were girls. We were taught values of love, kindness, generosity and family.
 I was brought up to understand that as a woman, my agency comes from being like a man and ‘making it’ in life.  I believed that education and a ‘good’ career will prove that I am equal. I also understood early on that as a girl, fear will be my constant companion along with shame. I learnt that I have to cover my body in-order to protect myself and that ‘good girls’ don’t have boy-friends. All through adolescence and early adulthood, I was ridden with guilt for being ‘bad’ in many different ways, from having boyfriends to asking too many questions. My life then was a constant struggle to hide my ‘bad-ness’ from my family and society in general. For years I went round and round in confused masochistic circles, trying to make sense of it all. 
It was a long and arduous journey for me to recognise the power within myself, as an individual and as a woman. I had blamed, for a large part, my cultural background for my feelings of powerless-less as a woman. My life in India was ridden with instances and stories of marital violence, abuse, rape and girl-child marriages. It seemed to me that if you were born in to that cultural context, you were doomed to a life of servitude, unless you fight tooth and nail to get out of it, somehow.

Research findings, so far
My Ancestors
Through my research during the last six months, I have learned that most of what I considered to be my cultural tradition is, in fact, only a few generations old, created by the influence of patriarchal Brahmanism, colonial law, and more recently, modernity through western development.
I have learned that my real cultural inheritance is not one of servitude, but one of incredible power. My research took me to a world of matriarchal clan living[3], where women made decisions not only about their own lives, but also for the whole clan. It took me to a world were women had lovers, not husbands[4]; where women, dressed the same as men and lived in an egalitarian clan structure in which men and women were equals[5]. I have learned that equality for women is not a modern concept. There were communities that practised equality in deeper ways than what we experience in our society today[6]; and that I belong to one such community.
I was shocked and felt betrayed by society. “Why didn’t anyone tell me??” In High School, we had two large history text books on the Second World War. I had to memorise who defeated whom in battles that ancient kings of India engaged in for no particular reason. Yet, all through school, university, and most of my life, I was ignorant about the history of my own people.  What shocked me most was the fact that a form of this matriarchal way of living was practised up until 1920s[7] - This was how my great-great grandmother lived.  It was challenging to reconcile with that fact that everything could be forgotten in just four generations; a period of time in which a whole community of women were displaced, from a position of power to that of servitude and shame.
As I investigated further, I began to uncover the depth of meaning of rituals and ceremonies that the Nair community still practise, remnants of more elaborate rituals from the past; most of which served to maintain the close relationship they had with the Earth. Nair clan houses always had a part of their property set aside as sacred groves. They also looked after temple elephants. I began to understand the relevance of stories and instances from my childhood with this perspective of ancient history and mythology.
Every clan house looked after ecologically significant sacred groves that housed many snakes. The oldest woman of the clan maintained a sacred relationship with the snakes and was the priestess of the sacred grove. Although I don’t remember a sacred grove in the house I grew up, I remember that snakes had a constant presence in my childhood, brushing against my feet as I played among the mango trees.  I remember distinctly being told that if I ever chance upon a mating ritual of snakes, I should not disturb them, nor should I stare. I was told that it was their sacred rite and I should respect their privacy.
A typical clan house had several sacred rooms, which housed the clan goddess (Bhagavati and/or Badrakali) as well as figures representing their ancestors[8]. Goddesses worship is still very strong in Kerala, with many goddess temples still preserving ecologically significant scared groves. The kindergarten I attended was inside a small Durga temple that had a sacred grove for the Snake gods. As we played hide-and-seek inside the sacred grove, presence of the fierce goddess felt comforting to my little heart that beat a little too fast with the fear of snakes. As my friend counted to ten with her eyes closed, I would always look up to the sky to spot the Eagle gods, cousins and rivals of Snake Gods, to say a small prayer for extra protection before venturing into the scared grove to hide.  
Nair men had a special relationship with temple elephants; folktales of this elephant-human friendship have been collected and published across Kerala. I remember my grandfather’s fondness for temple elephants, and was fortunate enough to have young temple elephants as playmates for many summers of my childhood. They would come for ten days every year, during the temple festival. We fed them giant rice balls filled with jaggery (palm sugar). I remember rough skin, soft pink tongue, beautiful long eye lashes; tenderness with which they picked me up, giant trunks wound around my small thin body.  
There are other communities in Kerala that used to practise matrifocal[9] kinship. These are mainly the Parayans and the Pulayans, who were subjugated by the warrior-like Nairs and later became slaves and untouchables in the caste hierarchy that was forced by patriarchal Brahmin invaders[10]. With great pain, I have to own up to the unimaginable violence that my ancestors had unleashed upon these communities; it included bonded labour, violence, rape and even beheadings for trivial matters such as crossing the path a Nair man was walking on. This serves as my grounding point in reminding me not to idealise the past. It also, more importantly, makes it crucial for me to investigate and document matrifocal kinship in these communities and their relationship to nature.
Western Ghats and Elephants
The geographical location of these communities, including that of my ancestors, is a dominant feature that cannot be ignored. Even today, the rainforests along the Western Ghats and the mountain range itself has a formidable presence in the life of people of Kerala, and to some extend in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra where it spills over in to these states. It served as a protective barrier during different eras of colonisation and also helped preserve the unique cultural identity of the communities that lived here. Matrifocal elements have been recorded in communities all along the Western Ghats, with strong matrifocal regions in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu[11]. Another interesting feature of this geographical location is the ecological significance of the place itself.  The Western Ghats, a UNESCO world heritage listed site, is one of the ‘eight ‘hottest hotspots’ of biological diversity in the world’[12]. The world’s single largest population of Asian Elephants live here. Encounters with wild Elephants are common occurrences in many parts of the Western Ghats; they are a part of everyday life that children going to school or women going to work have have to be wary of. 
Communities living here have co-existed with Elephants, wild and tame, for centuries. This relationship has become strained in recent times with shrinking forests, increasing human population and encroaching development.  Human-Elephant conflict in the Western Ghats is an issue that has resulted in many fatalities, both of Elephants and humans in the recent past[13].  This strong presence of Elephants in the lives of these communities is a fact that has special significance for my research when viewed from the perspective of matrifocal social organisation. Elephants live in matriarchal clans; matriarchal kin-ship amongst both Asian and African Elephants is well documented[14]. This has led me to look at matrifocal kinship amongst Asian elephants as a non-human version of this particular type of social organisation.  

Next Steps


As I spent more time on this research, I realised that it is now a very important part of my life.  Managing a couple of part time jobs and volunteering for few organisations has meant that it has taken a while - in fact six months - to reach where I am at the moment. I also do not have access to online journals or libraries other than the OASES libraries (which are great resources). This has meant that I have had to spend days in libraries, and lately most of my spare time, trying to find as much written material as available on this topic. As much as this has helped me to build theoretical groundwork, I find myself lacking in resources to continue this research. I have also found many references of relevant books and articles written in Malayalam. Apart from a few articles that I found online, most of these are currently out of my reach simply because they are not available to me here in Melbourne. I have realised that I have reached a stage where I need to go to Kerala to continue this work.
On a personal level, this work has had a deep impact on me and has consumed my mind, my thoughts and my dreams. It has become difficult to continue with my everyday life, as it feels disjointed from the thoughts that occupy my mind most of the time. Conversations with my mother about what she remembers, which is not much; passing on questions to great aunts who remember a lot; thinking of my great grand-mother, Lakshmi-Kutty Amma, my namesake; wondering about a sacred grove in our ancestral home that I have just come to know about; discussions with my sister about our grandmother, who seemed to have remembered in her body even if not in her conscious mind. Conversations with my great aunts have convinced me that I need to record their memories before it is too late. They represent my last link to a culture that is on the verge of disappearing forever. I have realised that I need to be physically present in the place to bring some calm to the storm that is in my mind and my heart. I need to touch the earth of my homeland, feel the weight of the humid air and drink the sweet water from the well in my ancestral home. I need to claim my ancestry. 
For these reasons, I have decided that the next step in my research journey is to visit Kerala.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Our story begins as four women, each one of us on our own zero-waste journey. We came together over our knowledge and passion about reducing waste and saw an opportunity to bring something new and exciting to Sudbury.  The concept of “zero-waste living” has been popping up in large Canadian cities such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, and Halifax, and prevalent in European countries. There are so many waste reduction initiatives happening across the city; it is apparent to us that Sudburians are part of the zero-waste movement.</p>
<p>The Nickel Refillery initiative was created in response to the growing demand for a more convenient location when it comes to a sustainable marketplace offering zero-waste products, as well as to foster opportunities to collaborate with others on their journey, no matter green or seasoned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Consumption to Sustainability </strong></p>
<p>Recycling has been labeled the most successful environmental initiative in human history. However, the exponential production of recyclable packaging products has overwhelmed the infrastructure and has created systemic barriers impacting the success of this initiative. </p>
<p>To adopt the principles of zero-waste living, we need to first discard the idea of waste. Everything is created from a resource, and waste is merely a resource going in the wrong direction. By changing the way resources are thought of, and thereby how they flow through our society and communities, we can reap substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits. This change in thinking is, in effect, the essential framework for a sustainable development model for the community. We save energy, water, resources, and greenspace by shifting our focus from consumption to sustainability. We reduce pollution of air, land, and water by using recycled materials. We create a host of new job opportunities that can benefit those in our society who face some of the greatest barriers to employment. Best of all, these positions can be generated in places like Sudbury, where livelihoods are created instead of landfills. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Store</strong></p>
<p>The Nickel Refillery (opening late summer of 2019) is a retail shop that will offer customers everyday zero-waste supplies and products that are free of plastic packaging. Our shop will offer only unpackaged or sustainably packaged items, and a variety of bulk products, many of them on tap. Here are some of the products you will find in the store: </p>
<ul>
<li>personal care and hygiene items for the entire family (hair and body care, mouth care, deodorant, shaving supplies)</li>
<li>home cleaning supplies (laundry supplies, dish soap, diswasher tabs, handsoap, multisurface cleaner)</li>
<li>ingredients for DIY projects (salts, baking soda, clay)</li>
<li>sustainable kitchen goods (wax wraps, metal and glass containers, brushes)</li>
<li>products made by local artisans (home and personal care)</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the past few months, we have sourced a variety of products with a focus on those that are local or Canadian, organic, non-toxic, preservative-free, and cruelty-free, all in bulk and without disposable packaging.  </p>
<p>The Nickel Refillery will also function as a community space for zero-waste workshops with diverse topics, such as clothing and toy swaps, DIY products, composting, waste-free lunches for kids, innovative ways to reuse packaging… the opportunities are endless!<br/><br/>As a local social enterprise, The Nickel Refillery will give back to Sudburians for their continued support. We will work with other community waste reduction groups to assist with their waste reduction initiatives across the city.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for at least $15,000 CAD to help with some of the start-up expenses. The selected location required refitting and repairs, with electrical, plumbing, and general restorations. After the renovations are complete, the equipment comes in. We need dispensary equipment, hoppers, commercial dishwasher, and extensive shelving, to name a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Part of adopting a waste free lifestyle is to change the way we shop. Your support will make a huge impact on helping us support you and your community in waste reduction.</p>
<p>As an incentive, we have put together a few zero-waste gifts of some of the items you will find at The Nickel Refillery, and we will also be creating a special sponsor wall. The gifts will be available on our opening day, so stay tuned for that announcement. Supporters who do not live in Sudbury will receive their gifts by mail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are so grateful for every contribution to our campaign.  Even if you are unable to back this project at this time, it would mean the world to us (and the planet) if you would share this campaign with your friends and family on social media, through email, and talk about it over dinner with friends or coffee at work. No matter how big or small the support, it will all make a difference. </p>

Our story begins as four women, each one of us on our own zero-waste journey. We came together over our knowledge and passion about reducing waste and saw an opportunity to bring something new and exciting to Sudbury.  The concept of “zero-waste living” has been popping up in large Canadian cities such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Montreal, Toronto, and Halifax, and prevalent in European countries. There are so many waste reduction initiatives happening across the city; it is apparent to us that Sudburians are part of the zero-waste movement.
The Nickel Refillery initiative was created in response to the growing demand for a more convenient location when it comes to a sustainable marketplace offering zero-waste products, as well as to foster opportunities to collaborate with others on their journey, no matter green or seasoned.
 
Consumption to Sustainability 
Recycling has been labeled the most successful environmental initiative in human history. However, the exponential production of recyclable packaging products has overwhelmed the infrastructure and has created systemic barriers impacting the success of this initiative. 
To adopt the principles of zero-waste living, we need to first discard the idea of waste. Everything is created from a resource, and waste is merely a resource going in the wrong direction. By changing the way resources are thought of, and thereby how they flow through our society and communities, we can reap substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits. This change in thinking is, in effect, the essential framework for a sustainable development model for the community. We save energy, water, resources, and greenspace by shifting our focus from consumption to sustainability. We reduce pollution of air, land, and water by using recycled materials. We create a host of new job opportunities that can benefit those in our society who face some of the greatest barriers to employment. Best of all, these positions can be generated in places like Sudbury, where livelihoods are created instead of landfills. 
 
The Store
The Nickel Refillery (opening late summer of 2019) is a retail shop that will offer customers everyday zero-waste supplies and products that are free of plastic packaging. Our shop will offer only unpackaged or sustainably packaged items, and a variety of bulk products, many of them on tap. Here are some of the products you will find in the store: 

personal care and hygiene items for the entire family (hair and body care, mouth care, deodorant, shaving supplies)
home cleaning supplies (laundry supplies, dish soap, diswasher tabs, handsoap, multisurface cleaner)
ingredients for DIY projects (salts, baking soda, clay)
sustainable kitchen goods (wax wraps, metal and glass containers, brushes)
products made by local artisans (home and personal care)

Over the past few months, we have sourced a variety of products with a focus on those that are local or Canadian, organic, non-toxic, preservative-free, and cruelty-free, all in bulk and without disposable packaging.  
The Nickel Refillery will also function as a community space for zero-waste workshops with diverse topics, such as clothing and toy swaps, DIY products, composting, waste-free lunches for kids, innovative ways to reuse packaging… the opportunities are endless!As a local social enterprise, The Nickel Refillery will give back to Sudburians for their continued support. We will work with other community waste reduction groups to assist with their waste reduction initiatives across the city.
 
What We Need
We are looking for at least $15,000 CAD to help with some of the start-up expenses. The selected location required refitting and repairs, with electrical, plumbing, and general restorations. After the renovations are complete, the equipment comes in. We need dispensary equipment, hoppers, commercial dishwasher, and extensive shelving, to name a few.
 
What You Get
Part of adopting a waste free lifestyle is to change the way we shop. Your support will make a huge impact on helping us support you and your community in waste reduction.
As an incentive, we have put together a few zero-waste gifts of some of the items you will find at The Nickel Refillery, and we will also be creating a special sponsor wall. The gifts will be available on our opening day, so stay tuned for that announcement. Supporters who do not live in Sudbury will receive their gifts by mail.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We are so grateful for every contribution to our campaign.  Even if you are unable to back this project at this time, it would mean the world to us (and the planet) if you would share this campaign with your friends and family on social media, through email, and talk about it over dinner with friends or coffee at work.

<h3>Hey Folks . . . </h3>
<ul>
<li>For the past seven years, I have been perfecting proprietary methods of growing and propagating perennial native wildflowers. With an inventory of well over ten thousand plants, I am ready to open a large Pollinator Park. To learn more about me, my background, experiences, and related accomplishments, <u><i><strong><a href=""https://www.poln8rsplus.org/founder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here.</a></strong></i></u>
</li>
<li>I am launching this campaign to help me close on a beautiful 56 acres of land, and will immediately begin planting my flowers . . . which will all bloom this year. Along with paid admissions, each spring we will have to harvest up to 100,000 new plant shoots, in order to maintain proper spacing. These will be sold or used to create additional Pollinator Habitat across the southeast.</li>
<li>I will plant, open, maintain, manage, and fully develop the park over the next five years. After five years I will give the Pollinator Park to a deserving organization, institution, or other entity. Every dollar invested in the park now, will equal one vote to determine who the park will be donated to in five years.  If the recipient of the park does not want to take over ownership, they can sell it, or defer to the second place winner.</li>
<li>A highly successful campaign will allow me to purchase the land, plant my flowers, and next spring plant up to 15 acres of pick-your-own berries. Plus . . . we will also be building working models of everything that can be powered by the heat of the sun, including space heating, water heating, cooking, drying, and much more. Plus . . . we will be planting native trees, shrubs, and vines. Did I mention total rain water harvesting with bio-sand filtration and solar sterilization?</li>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The Indo CorALliance is an environmental and social initiative based on the island of Nusa Penida, Indonesia. It was formed in response of the effects of COVID-19 policy on a tourism dependent island. The outbreak of the corona virus and the extreme but necessary measures taken around the world has hit the tourism industry hard. Although the break comes as welcome news to conservationists and our marine friends, millions of people have lost their livelihoods overnight.</p>
<p>Nusa Penida is a small island located 20 minutes south of the popular tourist destination, Bali. 80% of Bali’s economy relies on tourism and this loss of income has severely effected the local community. With the future of tourism so uncertain we have developed a new program to help both the coral reefs and coastal communities.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Coral reefs are a vital ecosystem to support both marine and terrestrial inhabitants by providing food, shelter, and a nursery ground. Economically, coral reefs have a key roll to support the livelihoods of coastal communities through fisheries and tourism. One of the leading causes to coral damage is high human activity and improper handling. Corona Virus has given our coral reefs the much-needed break they deserve and a chance to regrow in the absence of human activity. </p>
<p>Since early 2019 Indo Ocean Project’s lead marine biologist, Pascal Sebastian MSc, has implemented and managed a coral restoration project in Nusa Penida, Bali. He recently completed his Coral Propagation Instructor course and has developed a unique community project during these uncertain times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>There are 3 aims of this project:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To educate</strong> the community with a focus on local tourism operators in coral conservation and propagation methods. Sustainable and responsible tourism is the only way forward and we will use this break to empower local tourism industry workers to manage and monitor their own coral nursery. We will host multiple workshops to apply to their business practices when tourism returns to the island. We will train the local community in coral propagation methods under the supervision of a coral expert. </li>
<li>
<strong>To create jobs</strong> for those who are unemployed due to COVID-19 policy. We have started by hiring 3 Indonesian dive professionals for the title of “Coral Ranger” and 3 ""Research Assistants” nominated from the coral nurseries corresponding villages. We offer complete training and certification in coral propagation and empower these individuals to care for their nurseries and communities livelihoods through citizen science and coral gardening.</li>
<li>
<strong>To help our coral reefs</strong> <strong>thrive</strong>! Research approaches that can incorporate the social-ecological dynamics of reefs are increasingly seen as essential for understanding the future of our coral reefs (Williams et al., 2019). Research shows us that coral reef fisheries in some tropical Indo-Pacific countries will be unable to meet local demands long term due to climate change, but a more immediate concern is increased human activity. (Bell et al., 2013). We need to seize this opportunity of the absence of tourism on an otherwise high traffic island and regrow damaged areas of our fringing reef during these optimal growth conditions. Using a methodology tried and tested around the world we will restore damaged sections of reef along the northern coast of Nusa Penida with an eco friendly methodology. Over the next 6 months our CorAliance team will develop and monitor their nurseries noting growth rate, coral disease, mortality, and the effect on the surrounding ecosystem. </li>

<h3>Tentang Kami</h3>
<p>Indo CorAlliance adalah sebuah program untuk lingkungan dan sosial yang dilakukan di pulau Nusa Penida, Bali. Program ini dibentuk dalam respon terhadap pembatasan kegiatan masyarakat dikarenakan pandemi COVID-19 yang mengakibatkan tutupnya usaha-usaha seperti perhotelan dan wisata bahari. Banyak dari para pekerja yang kehilangan pekerjaan dan penghasilan pada masa sulit ini.</p>
<p>Nusa Penida adalah sebuah pulau kecil yang berjarak sekitar 20 menit ke arah tenggara dari Pulau Bali. Pulau ini sangat terkenal oleh keindahan alamnya, terurama keindahan bawah laut seperti terumbu karang dan ikan-ikan karang. Terumbu karang adalah ekosistem yang sangat penting untuk menunjang kehidupan di laut dengan menyediakan makanan dan juga tempat tinggal untuk makhluk-mahkluk laut. Secara ekonomi, terumbu karang juga berperan penting untuk menunjang kehidupan masyarakat pesisir melalui sektor perikanan dan juga pariwisata bahari.</p>
<p>Salah satu dari penyebab kerusakan ekosistem terumbu karang adalah praktek pariwisata yang tidak bertanggung jawab dan tidak berkelanjutan. Dengan behentinya semua kegiatan pariwisata, inilah saat yang baik untuk ekosistem terumbu karang untuk bertumbuh kembali.</p>
<p>Sejak 2019, Lembaga Swadaya Masyarakat Indo Ocean Project bersama ahli biologi laut, Pascal Sebastian, telah mengimplementasikan aktifitas restorasi terumbu karang di Nusa Penida. Pascal telah merancang sebuah program yang memberi manfaat bagi komunitas lokal dan juga ekosistem terumbu karang di masa yang tidak menentu ini.</p>
<p><br/>Tiga tujuan utama dari program ini:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>﻿﻿Mengedukasi ﻿komunitas lokal, </strong>khususnya bagi para pelaku pariwisata mengenai konservasi terumbu karang dan metode pengembangbiakannya. Pengelolaan yang berkelanjutan dan bertanggung jawab adalah filosofi yang akan dibagikan dalam bentuk seminar dan workshop. Mereka akan diberikan tanggung jawab untuk mengelola sebuah wilayah untuk perkembangbiakan terumbu karang (nursery), didampingi oleh ahli terumbu karang. Pada akhirnya, ilmu yang mereka dapat akan menjadi bekal untuk mengedukasi masyarakat sekitar dan juga turis-turis yang akan datang setelah pandemi berakhir.</li>
<li>﻿﻿<strong>Menciptakan lapangan perkerjaan﻿ </strong>bagi para pelaku pariwisata yang kehilangan pekerjaan dan penghasilang karena COVID-19. Kami memulai dengan tiga orang dari komunitas lokal dengan latar belakang pemandu selam dan tiga ﻿asisten dari area desa sesuai dengan lokasi pengembangbiakan. Kami akan membekali dengan sertifikasi pengembangbiakan koral﻿, pelatihan untuk mengelola ﻿nursery﻿-nya masing-masing﻿ dan berperan aktif dalam ﻿mengedukasi tentang pentingnya ekosistem terumbu karang untuk penghidupan masyarakat sekitar.</li>
<li>﻿<strong>Membantu pertumbuhan terumbu karang Nusa Penida. </strong>﻿Program penelitian yang ﻿melibatkan aspek sosial-ekologi terumbu karang menjadi hal yang sangat penting untuk mempelajari masa depan dari terumbu karang (Williams ﻿et al﻿., 2019). Sebuah penelitian juga menunjukan bahwa kegiatan perikanan di sekitar terumbu karang di wilayah negara tropis Indo-Pasifik tidak akan bertahan lama dikarenakan oleh perubahan iklim, namun kerusakan ini dipercepat oleh adanya penambahan tekanan dari aktifitas manusia (Bell ﻿et al.,﻿ 2013). Kita harus memanfaatkan momen ini, dimana aktifitas manusia sangat minimal sehingga kualitas lingkungan menjadi sangat optimal untuk terumbu karang berkembangbiak. Menggunakan metode yang telah diuji dan berhasil di lapangan, kami akan merestorasi wilayah-wilayah terumbu karang yang rusak di bagian pesisir pantai utara Nusa Penida dengan menggunakan metode yang 100% ramah lingkungan. Dalam waktu 6 bulan, tim CorAlliance akan terus mengembangkan dan memelihara ﻿nursery﻿, mengambil data pertumbuhan dan mengamati gangguan yang mungkin ada.</li>
</ul>
<p>﻿<br/><strong>﻿﻿Kami membutuhkan dukungan anda.</strong><br/>﻿Untuk membeli peralatan, biaya operasional dan menolong penghidupan dari komunitas lokal, kami membutuhkan donasi anda untuk memastikan keberlangsungan program ini.<br/>﻿</p>
<p><strong>﻿Donasi anda sangat berarti bagi kami:</strong></p>

Research approaches that can incorporate the social-ecological dynamics of reefs are increasingly seen as essential for understanding the future of our coral reefs (Williams et al., 2019). Research shows us that coral reef fisheries in some tropical Indo-Pacific countries will be unable to meet local demands long term due to climate change, but a more immediate concern is increased human activity. (Bell et al., 2013). We need to seize this opportunity of the absence of tourism on an otherwise high traffic island and regrow damaged areas of our fringing reef during these optimal growth conditions. Using a methodology tried and tested around the world we will restore damaged sections of reef along the northern coast of Nusa Penida with an eco friendly methodology. Over the next 6 months our CorAliance team will develop and monitor their nurseries noting growth rate, coral disease, mortality, and the effect on the surrounding ecosystem.

Tentang Kami
Indo CorAlliance adalah sebuah program untuk lingkungan dan sosial yang dilakukan di pulau Nusa Penida, Bali. Program ini dibentuk dalam respon terhadap pembatasan kegiatan masyarakat dikarenakan pandemi COVID-19 yang mengakibatkan tutupnya usaha-usaha seperti perhotelan dan wisata bahari. Banyak dari para pekerja yang kehilangan pekerjaan dan penghasilan pada masa sulit ini.
Nusa Penida adalah sebuah pulau kecil yang berjarak sekitar 20 menit ke arah tenggara dari Pulau Bali. Pulau ini sangat terkenal oleh keindahan alamnya, terurama keindahan bawah laut seperti terumbu karang dan ikan-ikan karang. Terumbu karang adalah ekosistem yang sangat penting untuk menunjang kehidupan di laut dengan menyediakan makanan dan juga tempat tinggal untuk makhluk-mahkluk laut. Secara ekonomi, terumbu karang juga berperan penting untuk menunjang kehidupan masyarakat pesisir melalui sektor perikanan dan juga pariwisata bahari.
Salah satu dari penyebab kerusakan ekosistem terumbu karang adalah praktek pariwisata yang tidak bertanggung jawab dan tidak berkelanjutan. Dengan behentinya semua kegiatan pariwisata, inilah saat yang baik untuk ekosistem terumbu karang untuk bertumbuh kembali.
Sejak 2019, Lembaga Swadaya Masyarakat Indo Ocean Project bersama ahli biologi laut, Pascal Sebastian, telah mengimplementasikan aktifitas restorasi terumbu karang di Nusa Penida. Pascal telah merancang sebuah program yang memberi manfaat bagi komunitas lokal dan juga ekosistem terumbu karang di masa yang tidak menentu ini.
Tiga tujuan utama dari program ini:


﻿﻿Mengedukasi ﻿komunitas lokal, khususnya bagi para pelaku pariwisata mengenai konservasi terumbu karang dan metode pengembangbiakannya. Pengelolaan yang berkelanjutan dan bertanggung jawab adalah filosofi yang akan dibagikan dalam bentuk seminar dan workshop. Mereka akan diberikan tanggung jawab untuk mengelola sebuah wilayah untuk perkembangbiakan terumbu karang (nursery), didampingi oleh ahli terumbu karang. Pada akhirnya, ilmu yang mereka dapat akan menjadi bekal untuk mengedukasi masyarakat sekitar dan juga turis-turis yang akan datang setelah pandemi berakhir.
﻿﻿Menciptakan lapangan perkerjaan﻿ bagi para pelaku pariwisata yang kehilangan pekerjaan dan penghasilang karena COVID-19. Kami memulai dengan tiga orang dari komunitas lokal dengan latar belakang pemandu selam dan tiga ﻿asisten dari area desa sesuai dengan lokasi pengembangbiakan. Kami akan membekali dengan sertifikasi pengembangbiakan koral﻿, pelatihan untuk mengelola ﻿nursery﻿-nya masing-masing﻿ dan berperan aktif dalam ﻿mengedukasi tentang pentingnya ekosistem terumbu karang untuk penghidupan masyarakat sekitar.
﻿Membantu pertumbuhan terumbu karang Nusa Penida. ﻿Program penelitian yang ﻿melibatkan aspek sosial-ekologi terumbu karang menjadi hal yang sangat penting untuk mempelajari masa depan dari terumbu karang (Williams ﻿et al﻿., 2019). Sebuah penelitian juga menunjukan bahwa kegiatan perikanan di sekitar terumbu karang di wilayah negara tropis Indo-Pasifik tidak akan bertahan lama dikarenakan oleh perubahan iklim, namun kerusakan ini dipercepat oleh adanya penambahan tekanan dari aktifitas manusia (Bell ﻿et al.,﻿ 2013). Kita harus memanfaatkan momen ini, dimana aktifitas manusia sangat minimal sehingga kualitas lingkungan menjadi sangat optimal untuk terumbu karang berkembangbiak. Menggunakan metode yang telah diuji dan berhasil di lapangan, kami akan merestorasi wilayah-wilayah terumbu karang yang rusak di bagian pesisir pantai utara Nusa Penida dengan menggunakan metode yang 100% ramah lingkungan. Dalam waktu 6 bulan, tim CorAlliance akan terus mengembangkan dan memelihara ﻿nursery﻿, mengambil data pertumbuhan dan mengamati gangguan yang mungkin ada.

﻿﻿﻿Kami membutuhkan dukungan anda.﻿Untuk membeli peralatan, biaya operasional dan menolong penghidupan dari komunitas lokal, kami membutuhkan donasi anda untuk memastikan keberlangsungan program ini.﻿
﻿Donasi anda sangat berarti bagi kami:
Sekecil apapun donasi yang anda berikan dapat membantu kami untuk:﻿﻿﻿
﻿Rp. 10.000 - ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿pencetakan lembar data dan peralatan tulis﻿Rp. 50.000 - Wadah pemindah terumbu karang atau alat ukur pertumbuhan﻿Rp. 100.000 - Suplai 1 bulan untuk katalis koral﻿Rp. 500.000 - Suplai 1-2 bulan untuk mengelola ﻿nursery﻿ ﻿﻿tiga lokasi yang berbeda﻿Rp. 1.000.000 - Kontribusi untuk sumber penghasilan dari anggota kami﻿Rp 2.000.000 - Pengembangan ﻿lokasi ﻿nursery ﻿baru dan lebih banyak komunitas lokal yang dapat kami libatkan

My name is Tracy Prescott-MacGregor. My husband and I are self sufficient farmers in a beautiful corner of the world on the Columbia River in Clatskanie, Oregon. We are surrounded by other beautiful farms growing blueberries, cottonwood trees, mint and raising cattle. This area has some of the finest soils in North America laid down by thousands of years of periodic flooding. Near my home, 837 acres of working farmland owned by the Port of St Helens, on Port Westward, have recently been rezoned from Prime Agricultural to Rural Industrial. The Port of St. Helens has plans to double the size of their existing Industrial terminal.</p><p>Several months ago, the Port of St. Helens began using a defunct Ethanol plant at Port Westward to ship crude oil from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. From Port Westward it is pumped into barges and shipped down the Columbia River to refineries in Washington and California.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Port purchased the surrounding agricultural land adjacent to it's existing terminal. In order to expand, they needed to rezone the land from Prime Agricultural to Rural Industrial. Our Columbia County Planning Commission voted 5-1 against this rezone in support of the farms and wildlife.  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A few months later the Columbia County Commissioners voted unanimously to rezone this farmland in favor of Industry. </span></p><p>At risk are several hundred acres of farmland currently being used to grow food. This land will be industrialized in order to build the expanded rail loop and oil terminal. In light of the many recent horrific accidents involving the caustic Bakken crude shipped by rail in poorly designed tank cars this is obviously a hazardous procedure. We risk toxic spills and explosive fire anywhere along the rail lines used to deliver this oil thus endangering communities from North Dakota to the refineries. A local disaster in Port Westward will not only devastate our farmland, but because of the interconnected tidal nature of the dike lands will result in a widespread ecological catastrophe.</p><p>Additionally, the rezoning encompasses about two miles of wildlife habitat along the Columbia River shore where expanded docks are planned. This development threatens salmon, eagle, heron and kingfisher populations to name only a few. </p><p>Many folks use this area for fishing, hunting and recreation like boating, swimming and birding.

My name is Tracy Prescott-MacGregor. My husband and I are self sufficient farmers in a beautiful corner of the world on the Columbia River in Clatskanie, Oregon. We are surrounded by other beautiful farms growing blueberries, cottonwood trees, mint and raising cattle. This area has some of the finest soils in North America laid down by thousands of years of periodic flooding. Near my home, 837 acres of working farmland owned by the Port of St Helens, on Port Westward, have recently been rezoned from Prime Agricultural to Rural Industrial. The Port of St. Helens has plans to double the size of their existing Industrial terminal.Several months ago, the Port of St. Helens began using a defunct Ethanol plant at Port Westward to ship crude oil from the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. From Port Westward it is pumped into barges and shipped down the Columbia River to refineries in Washington and California.  The Port purchased the surrounding agricultural land adjacent to it's existing terminal. In order to expand, they needed to rezone the land from Prime Agricultural to Rural Industrial. Our Columbia County Planning Commission voted 5-1 against this rezone in support of the farms and wildlife.  A few months later the Columbia County Commissioners voted unanimously to rezone this farmland in favor of Industry. At risk are several hundred acres of farmland currently being used to grow food. This land will be industrialized in order to build the expanded rail loop and oil terminal. In light of the many recent horrific accidents involving the caustic Bakken crude shipped by rail in poorly designed tank cars this is obviously a hazardous procedure. We risk toxic spills and explosive fire anywhere along the rail lines used to deliver this oil thus endangering communities from North Dakota to the refineries. A local disaster in Port Westward will not only devastate our farmland, but because of the interconnected tidal nature of the dike lands will result in a widespread ecological catastrophe.Additionally, the rezoning encompasses about two miles of wildlife habitat along the Columbia River shore where expanded docks are planned. This development threatens salmon, eagle, heron and kingfisher populations to name only a few. Many folks use this area for fishing, hunting and recreation like boating, swimming and birding. We need to preserve the beauty and the bounty of what's here. There are not many more places along the Columbia that can boast this peaceful coexistence between man and wildlife. We want this to be here for our grand kids...for YOUR grand kids.Help us protect this land by contributing today.What We Need & What You Get

With a population of more than seven billion, and increasing at a rate of more than six million people every month, there will be a greater and greater demand being placed on the finite resources available to satisfy global needs.  The world's population is also moving into an era of enhanced awareness of each other, and with this awareness comes a demand for greater equality in the standard of living between nations.  No longer will developed nations be able to exploit with impunity the less developed nations of the world, purely to satisfy their own selfish needs.  A reckoning is coming, or here.</p>
<p> The overpopulation issue is probably the most serious problem facing us today.  While there are many other issues of concern, ranging from global warming and climate change through poverty, freshwater depletion, and civil unrest, it is overpopulation that is the root cause of our turmoil.  It is the size of the human population that the earth can support that we must confront, and resolve.</p>
<p> In an attempt to address the issue of global overpopulation and the multitude of problems associated with it, the concept of utopization was developed.  Utopization is an invented word that was fabricated from two words, utopia and civilization, and is intended to reflect the advancement of humankind to societies that are based on the limitations of our planet, and the best behavioural characteristics of our species. Utopization reflects the perfection of human societies in a Utopian World.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Accomplishments To-Date</h3> <p>The concept of utopization was developed by Leonard W. Mottus over a two-year period to address the issue of global overpopulation. Dr. Mottus is a behavioural scientist with extensive experience in multi-disciplinary environmental impact studies. He has also worked in finance, in marketing, and in various other public service businesses.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the development of the utopization strategy, and in order to facilitate explaining the concept, Dr. Mottus wrote the book ""<em>Utopization - From Chaos To Utopia</em>"". In 482 pages, this book addresses the issue of global overpopulation by providing a perspective of the problem from our historic past, through today, and into the future. Then, a strategy for confronting the problem is presented that will function as a starting point to move us towards a Utopian World.</p>
<p>This book was published in December 2012, and marketing commenced in January 2013.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Over the last two years, this book has been sent to the leaders of 160 nations with small populations, and to several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals who have a global footprint and are uniquely qualified to participate in this vision for the future.  We have also been active on social media (Facebook and Twitter), expanding an awareness of this program to the global community. Now, it is time to move to the next phase of this program, and to activate a multi-media marketing campaign - the reason for this crowdfunding application.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Next Step</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>It is
believed that the groundwork for this utopian program has now been set, and
that we can proceed to the next phase of this program, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Follow-up
communications to the initial 160 nations contacted;</p></li>
<li><p>Targeted follow-up of select nations, especially those that have a high probability of
rapidly becoming a Utopian Nation. Hopefully this will include one-on-one meetings with senior personnel;</p></li>
<li><p>Pursue a
public-speaking campaign, starting locally and expanding as funds and demand
dictate; and</p></li>
<li><p>Commence multi-media
marketing using TV and radio presentations, initially in North America and
expanding as warranted.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The amount
of money we receive from this crowdfunding application will determine how far
we can progress on this program. If we reach the identified target of $100,000, we believe
that we will be able to successfully establish a utopization mind-set in the
global community. If we receive less, we will move the program as far as
possible, and try to progress further later. If we receive more, we will
accomplish more.</p>
<p>One final
point. If we can get one or more nations to commit to this utopian strategy,
there will be the need for more money because we will need to establish an
official utopian organization. This however is a good thing, because at that
point, the world will be on the path towards a better future.<br/></p>
<h3>Achieving Utopia</h3>
<p>With utopization, the issue of
overpopulation will be of critical importance, and it will be confronted
head-on.<span>  Today, however, it is virtually
ignored, but why? </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>It is
almost inconceivable that there is no widespread concern about the number of
people in the world, and the need to do something about it.<span>  Overpopulation issues are everywhere, with
extremes in the number and size of slums around the world, famine and
unwarranted deaths in many countries, and social unrest and uneasiness
everywhere about providing the basic needs for survival.  How can anyone be oblivious to the issue of
overpopulation?  This is an unbelievable
situation, but it is actually happening today.</span></p>
<p>That
being said, it is not hard to imagine why overpopulation and population control
is not given serious consideration by people and nations today.<span>  When it comes to human reproduction and the
imposition of some sort of control on breeding behaviour, problems are
unavoidable.  Whether through basic human
sexual impulses, religious implications, or social necessities, population
control is difficult to implement.  This,
however, must change.</span></p>
<p>It is
vital that overpopulation be moved to an elevated level of awareness in the
global community as soon as possible.<span> 
There is no avoiding the fact that when there are too many people
placing a demand on limited resources, chaos results.  Overpopulation must be a concern that is
recognized by all, for if it is not, the likelihood that an amiable world may
be achieved will disappear.  We simply must
learn to control our numbers, and utopization may be the way.</span><br/></p>
<h3>Confronting The Challenges </h3>
<p></p>
<p>To-date, there has been little progress on finding any leader who will commit to the concept of utopization, in spite of the fact that it is logical, and the right thing to do. It is obvious that the world is in a mess, but nobody is doing anything significant about it. However, we believe that if we can ingrain a few macro factors into the mind-set of decision makers, progress will be. These factors are;</p>
<p>•	ACCEPT the fact that we have an overpopulation problem now, and it is increasing;<br/>•	ACKNOWLEDGE that man lives within the laws of nature, and that while we may be able to manipulate our place in nature somewhat, we cannot remain aloof forever;<br/>•	UNDERSTAND that limited resources do impose limits on populations of all types, including humans;<br/>•	LEARN to recognize and appreciate the signs of overpopulation, especially the existence of slums, and the need by a people to rely on foreign aid;<br/>•	APPRECIATE that it is possible to attain a good life for all of a nation's people if they live within their means and resources;<br/>•	BE PREPARED to start on the journey towards a Utopian World by concentrating on one or more small nations, and then growing by example and through success; and<br/>•	DO NOT expect the United Nations or any large nation to come to the rescue.  Population control is a contentious issue, and achieving consensus within large groups will be difficult.</p>
<p> These considerations will probably form the backbone for a strategy to address the issue of global overpopulation, and must be integrated into the mind-set of anyone who becomes involved in this utopian program.</p>
<p> Once we acknowledge the macro factors mentioned above, we can move on to understanding the problem before us, and to finding a possible solution.  The website <a href=""http://www.utopization.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.utopization.com</u></a> provides an introduction to this issue, and the material in the book ""Utopization - From Chaos To Utopia"" provides a detailed explanation of what me must/should/could do now (see <u><a href=""http://www.utopization.net/books.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.utopization.net/books.html</a></u>)<a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a> It is time  to control our numbers, and utopization may be the way.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
</div><div>If we are going to be successful in introducing the concept of utopization to the world, we need to get the word out. We need to communicate the attributes of the strategy on a global scale, and social media must be aggressively utilized. In this regard, please follow us on Facebook and Twitter and share/retweet our postings. Also, don't forget the Indiegogo share tool. The more exposure we can get, the better.</div><div>
<p>One final point. As this program develops, we will need to establish a core group of multi-disciplinary professionals to develop the terms and conditions of the program, and to implement it.

An important component of this project was the assessment of the impact of whale watching tourism and vessel traffic on the animals. When commercial or whale watching boats approached the whales, individuals responded elusively 27% of the time; mostly due to an inadequate approach or following maneuvers. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/473941/files/20140331125214-surfers.png?1396295534"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Although what is depicted by the photograph above may seem like a very exciting experience, this is precisely the kind of whale-tourism interaction that we are trying to prevent. In this case, two surfers jumped off a whale watching boat and into the water with a group of approximately seven whales. This was a competitive group, where several males were competing for a receptive female. In this context, the animals can behave aggressive and quickly change direction, which could have been very dangerous for both the whales and the tourists. <p></p><p>Now that we have some evidence that whale watching can have some negative effects on the whales that come to Colombia to mate and nurse their young, we need <b>YOUR generous support</b> to help us <b>protect them</b>.

We will visit the seven villages that comprise Tribugá’s Gulf and develop a series of
workshops that will facilitate cooperation between researchers and tourism operators. Additionally, we will complete different
environmental education activities, including writing/drawing contests, games, cultural
manifestations, beach cleanings, and projection of movies/documentaries. During boat trips, the research team will monitor the type of approach and maneuvers of whale watching vessels.
When sighting a group along with another boat(s), the heading and speed, as well as changes in
diving pattern and surface behavior, will be recorded to describe the behavioral response of the
animals. This information will provide feedback for the workshops that will be implemented with whale
watching operators of Tribugá’s Gulf.

<p></p></div>","Hi there!My name is Natalia Botero and I work with Macuáticos Colombia Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the study and conservation of aquatic mammals in Colombia. Most of our research efforts have focused on humpback whales in the Colombian Pacific, although we also work with several dolphin species and the West Indian Manatee. We have been studying this population of humpback whales since 2009 when we first registered seven cetacean species in coastal waters of Tribugá's Gulf as part of an inventory study. Then, in 2013, we monitored the spatial distribution, social and acoustic behavior of the species during the breeding season. An important component of this project was the assessment of the impact of whale watching tourism and vessel traffic on the animals. When commercial or whale watching boats approached the whales, individuals responded elusively 27% of the time; mostly due to an inadequate approach or following maneuvers. Although what is depicted by the photograph above may seem like a very exciting experience, this is precisely the kind of whale-tourism interaction that we are trying to prevent. In this case, two surfers jumped off a whale watching boat and into the water with a group of approximately seven whales. This was a competitive group, where several males were competing for a receptive female. In this context, the animals can behave aggressive and quickly change direction, which could have been very dangerous for both the whales and the tourists. Now that we have some evidence that whale watching can have some negative effects on the whales that come to Colombia to mate and nurse their young, we need YOUR generous support to help us protect them. We believe that the best way to create a long-lasting conservation effect is to work in association with the local communities. An alliance with the whale watching operators in Tribugá's Gulf will help us achieve our goal to carry on a long-term research program while supporting sustainable economic alternatives for the local communities.Our main goal:Evaluate the possibility of integrating scientific research and whale watching tourism in order to support a long term monitoring program focused on humpback whales that will overcome the prevailing information gaps and support alternative economic strategies for the local communities in Tribugá’s Gulf, Colombian Pacific. Our specific objectives: - Examine the conservation impact of whale watching and artisanal fishing on the behavior and habitat use of wintering humpback whales around Tribugá’s Gulf. - Assess the potential use of community based whale watching as a platform for scientific research and environmental education. - Describe the patterns of behavior, social structure and spatial distribution of Humpback whales during the breeding season. - Associate with the local communities to develop educative and cultural activities that value their traditional knowledge and promote the conservation of natural resources in the region.How are we going to achieve those goals? 1. Environmental Education


We will visit the seven villages that comprise Tribugá’s Gulf and develop a series of
workshops that will facilitate cooperation between researchers and tourism operators. Additionally, we will complete different
environmental education activities, including writing/drawing contests, games, cultural
manifestations, beach cleanings, and projection of movies/documentaries. During boat trips, the research team will monitor the type of approach and maneuvers of whale watching vessels.
When sighting a group along with another boat(s), the heading and speed, as well as changes in
diving pattern and surface behavior, will be recorded to describe the behavioral response of the
animals. This information will provide feedback for the workshops that will be implemented with whale
watching operators of Tribugá’s Gulf.

2. Boat tripsA minimum of 60 boat surveys will be made during the breeding season of humpback whales (mid June-mid November). Additional trips will also occur opportunistically as researchers will be available to join fishermen and/or whale watching operators.   After sighting a group, the boat will approach until an estimated distance of 100m, behind or parallel
to the animals. Information about group size, age classes, surface behavior, diving patterns,
heading, position and oceanographic/climatic conditions will be recorded. A single hydrophone will
be deployed when the boat is stopped or whenever singers are detected. Photographs of the caudal fin
will be taken to complement Macuáticos’s photo-id catalog. Individuals will be classified as part of
the same group if they maintain physical proximity and exhibit coordinated surface behavior.



 How are the funds going to be used?
Your generous contribution will support the successful completion of this project by covering some of the boat surveys (fuel, boat rental, boat driver: US$ 9,000.00), environmental education and community work (on-site travel, office supplies, arts and crafts supplies: US$ 2,000.00), and activities in support of the research team (housing, groceries and food preparation, travel to the field site: US$4,000.00).Jeez!

behavior and habitat use of humpback whales during the breeding season.

<h3>My story</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah and I am a young mother who has an ecologic vision. I want to share that vision with all the families by creating and offering cloth diaper products and other eco-friendly toys and accessories that are affordable and localy made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It all started when I got pregnant with my first child at the age of 18. I soon realised that cloth diapering wasn`t as accessible to all families and budgets as I thought it would be. My mother in-law, who is a creative sewer offered me to make the cloth diapers for my son and this is when Les p`tites foufounes vertes started. We realised that it was possible to make and sell cloth diapers at more reasonable prices without comprimising quality materials. By being flexible with payments and by offering various options and complete packages we are able reach out to every family with every type of budget. Making cloth diapers and other eco-friendly products accessible for every family is a must and my goal would be to see every single baby cloth diapered.</p>
<p>What we are looking to do here is gather enough money to cover the cost of redoing our website professionaly and maybe if we can get more money then our objective we could be more prepared (adds in newpapers, buying more material to create more products) for our upcoming expositions this summer.</p>

</p><p>We can’t wait any longer it’s time to start the process of
turning things around. Even if you read no further, the video should have
convinced you: that Green buildings save money, is healthy for our environment
and will create Millions of Jobs. With your help we can build a strong company
that will be at the forefront of helping to rebuild our climate. We intend to
make it our goal to inform, help get financing in place, connect all the
certified contractors with owners and build a website that can make this entire process seamless.</p>
<p>Too often taxpayers who could benefit from the deductions
and credits might not be aware of them, and in most cases are missing out on
substantial savings that are available to remodel existing homes and workplaces
to save energy and, as a bonus, get most of the work funded by the Federal Government; while at the same time help heal our
planet.</p>
<p>Our company will make all this possible, while making connections with numerous funding sources
for green building including grants, tax-credits, loans, or others; which are
available at the national, state, and local levels. There is more than $23billion dollars available to help fund this aggressive venture and we would like to show America how to access it.</p>
<p>We will link the client with the
applications to obtain such funding; link them to a list of certified
contractors in their area; as well as, offer partnerships where those who partner with us can sign up
people in their area that are eligible to get any of our services .  </p>
<p>Our company promotes Smart Growth, which relates to
sustainable development that serves the economy, the community, and the
environment by reducing waste, emissions and consumes less energy than
conventional building standard practices. 
This will support healthy communities while creating economic
development and jobs. Our goal is to infuse technology with nature while on a
mission to help heal our planet. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/876672/files/20140923081845-earth_p.jpg?1411485525"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Did you know…?</strong></p>
<p>The rate of Global Warming is not a natural occurrence, but
it is the result of human activity?</p>
<p><i>For example:</i></p>
<p>The amount of sewage Americans dump into their waters (16
tons) every minute of every day.</p>
<p>The number of plastic bottles thrown away by Americans every
hour is 2.5 million.</p>
<p>U.S. buildings contribute to 38.1% of the nation’s total
carbon dioxide emissions. </p>
<p>The development of clean energy, including solar wind, and
geothermal energy helps reduce the trend of global warming and its effect on
the atmosphere and reduce the overall impact on our environment, on human
health and the economy.</p>
<p>All funding raised will help us  launch our program in
early 2015.  100% of the funding we receive
will go directly to developing and launching this project and help you
incorporate green building concepts into your home and buildings.</p>
<p><b>We are running out of time to turn things around…. Contribute Today!!!!!</b></p><strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/876677/files/20140923081937-earth2.jpg?1411485577"" src="""" style=""""/></p></strong>
<p>Our goal is to raise the consciousness of the homeowner to address
the issues of planetary survival.  We
will show homeowners and building owners how to treat their property as a
“SYSTEM” by becoming 50% more efficient, cut the cost of their utility bills
drastically and help maintain the natural ecological balance in the
environment.</p>

We can’t wait any longer it’s time to start the process of
turning things around. Even if you read no further, the video should have
convinced you: that Green buildings save money, is healthy for our environment
and will create Millions of Jobs. With your help we can build a strong company
that will be at the forefront of helping to rebuild our climate. We intend to
make it our goal to inform, help get financing in place, connect all the
certified contractors with owners and build a website that can make this entire process seamless.
Too often taxpayers who could benefit from the deductions
and credits might not be aware of them, and in most cases are missing out on
substantial savings that are available to remodel existing homes and workplaces
to save energy and, as a bonus, get most of the work funded by the Federal Government; while at the same time help heal our
planet.
Our company will make all this possible, while making connections with numerous funding sources
for green building including grants, tax-credits, loans, or others; which are
available at the national, state, and local levels. There is more than $23billion dollars available to help fund this aggressive venture and we would like to show America how to access it.
We will link the client with the
applications to obtain such funding; link them to a list of certified
contractors in their area; as well as, offer partnerships where those who partner with us can sign up
people in their area that are eligible to get any of our services .  
Our company promotes Smart Growth, which relates to
sustainable development that serves the economy, the community, and the
environment by reducing waste, emissions and consumes less energy than
conventional building standard practices. 
This will support healthy communities while creating economic
development and jobs. Our goal is to infuse technology with nature while on a
mission to help heal our planet. 
Did you know…?
The rate of Global Warming is not a natural occurrence, but
it is the result of human activity?
For example:
The amount of sewage Americans dump into their waters (16
tons) every minute of every day.
The number of plastic bottles thrown away by Americans every
hour is 2.5 million.
U.S. buildings contribute to 38.1% of the nation’s total
carbon dioxide emissions. 
The development of clean energy, including solar wind, and
geothermal energy helps reduce the trend of global warming and its effect on
the atmosphere and reduce the overall impact on our environment, on human
health and the economy.
All funding raised will help us  launch our program in
early 2015.  100% of the funding we receive
will go directly to developing and launching this project and help you
incorporate green building concepts into your home and buildings.
We are running out of time to turn things around…. Contribute Today!!!!!
Our goal is to raise the consciousness of the homeowner to address
the issues of planetary survival.  We
will show homeowners and building owners how to treat their property as a
“SYSTEM” by becoming 50% more efficient, cut the cost of their utility bills
drastically and help maintain the natural ecological balance in the
environment.
Our total fundraising goal is $150,000 (by February 2015).  
Timeline: Goal is to launch in Spring  2015.
Your contribution will help us to build our program for
launch.  We need the following:

Graphic Designer to design our Website
Website Architect
Program Development
Application Developer/Programmer
Outreach and Implementation Team 
24hr Call center
Internet security
Research Team
Licenses/Bond/Insurance
International Registrations
Office equipment 
Lawyer Retention
Advertisement 
Phase 1:  Build
general website for launch.   
Phase 2:  Develop
materials and outreach plan for the launch. 
Phase 3: Create a Call Center 
Phase 4: Develop a research team
Phase 5: Launch Party
Phase 6: Start signing up customers
Your contribution will help us with Phases 1thru 6, the building
and launching of our program.  Even if we
don’t reach our goal here, we will be moving forward and building our program,
however it will take us longer.
We don’t have time to wait……, so please contribute whatever
you can and help us spread the word.  We
are on a mission to healing our planet. 
We look forward to hearing from you and working together to
make our project a success!!

<p>I am pleased to submit this proposal for general operating support for Ocean Blue Project. We are a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit benefit corporation. We would not be the non-profit organization that we are today without the rivers, urban streams and Oregon beaches! We will continue to give back for the rest of our life what the rivers have already given us. </p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for all the community and media support that enables us to continue our work with our Oregon Beaches, Rivers, and Urban Streams. Our volunteer base has grown more than we expected and we are now able to clean up more rivers at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Our mission is to foster connections between communities, science and nature, so that together we can protect urban streams, rivers, and ultimately, the world's oceans. We are currently operating at the scale of 40 events a year, with more than 200 volunteers, and covering thousands of acres of streams.</p>
<p>Although our resources are limited, we make the greatest possible impact. We have restored habitats for Oregon native plants and species, such as ducks and bees. Every year, we reach out to schools to teach children about our streams. We initiate internship programs with Oregon State University to further their research endeavors.</p>
<p>We have seen tremendous evidence of our impact in our streams and communities over the past four years. We have only begun to realize our organization’s potential in helping the environment.</p>

<b>ENGLISH VERSION</b><br/><div>
<div>
<div align=""left"" style=""text-align: center;"">
<b><br/></b><div align=""left"">
<b>What is this project all about?<br/></b>THE GARDEN ESTATE is a social eco farming project in Sri Lanka. 
Originally a brownfield site within about three years we have planted 
hundreds of plants (especially fruit trees and coconut palms), created a
 large lake, built a house of clay, timber and bamboo as well as 
established a renewable power supply with a small wind turbine and solar
 panels.<br/><p>
We refrain from using any artificial fertilizers and pesticides on THE 
GARDEN ESTATE. The name of the project shall be our program: We are 
working to create a large and diverse garden. The project gives people 
work and feeds them.</p>
<p>THE GARDEN ESTATE is adjacent to the largest national park in Sri 
Lanka – the Wilpattu Forest Reserve. Above all having a national park 
next door for us means tranquility and the view towards a huge forest. 
With the ecological management of THE GARDEN ESTATE, we do our part that
 less agricultural chemicals get into the National Park.</p>
<b>
</b>
</div>
</div>
<div align=""left"">
<strong>Why crowdfunding for cows?</strong><br/>Rathie is already there! Our first cow lives at THE GARDEN ESTATE since 2013, and had her first calf Wasana in January. The natural land with 
it's juicy grass is a paradise for Rathie and Wasana. But our single mum
 Rathie is lonely and only has a temporary shelter. Therefore we want to
 bring in some cow friends and build a proper barn.<br/>
</div>
<p>For our project, cows are very valuable and provide a good basis in the long run:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular milk sales enable us to feed at least two families (given 5 dairy cows).</li>
<li>These families can maintain the plants, grow vegetables, fruits and 
spices. Generating income from these products will enable us to pay more
 workers and more families can profit from THE GARDEN ESTATE.</li>
<li>Cows also help us to keep the lush sprouting grass short, which we 
would otherwise have to mow by hand or consume fossil fuel for a lawn 
mower.</li>
<li>Finally, we can collect dung in the barn: cow dung is great 
fertilizer! At the moment we have to buy it, and we want to save these 
costs.</li>
</ul>

What is this project all about?THE GARDEN ESTATE is a social eco farming project in Sri Lanka. 
Originally a brownfield site within about three years we have planted 
hundreds of plants (especially fruit trees and coconut palms), created a
 large lake, built a house of clay, timber and bamboo as well as 
established a renewable power supply with a small wind turbine and solar
 panels.
We refrain from using any artificial fertilizers and pesticides on THE 
GARDEN ESTATE. The name of the project shall be our program: We are 
working to create a large and diverse garden. The project gives people 
work and feeds them.
THE GARDEN ESTATE is adjacent to the largest national park in Sri 
Lanka – the Wilpattu Forest Reserve. Above all having a national park 
next door for us means tranquility and the view towards a huge forest. 
With the ecological management of THE GARDEN ESTATE, we do our part that
 less agricultural chemicals get into the National Park.





Why crowdfunding for cows?Rathie is already there! Our first cow lives at THE GARDEN ESTATE since 2013, and had her first calf Wasana in January. The natural land with 
it's juicy grass is a paradise for Rathie and Wasana. But our single mum
 Rathie is lonely and only has a temporary shelter. Therefore we want to
 bring in some cow friends and build a proper barn.

For our project, cows are very valuable and provide a good basis in the long run:


Regular milk sales enable us to feed at least two families (given 5 dairy cows).
These families can maintain the plants, grow vegetables, fruits and 
spices. Generating income from these products will enable us to pay more
 workers and more families can profit from THE GARDEN ESTATE.
Cows also help us to keep the lush sprouting grass short, which we 
would otherwise have to mow by hand or consume fossil fuel for a lawn 
mower.
Finally, we can collect dung in the barn: cow dung is great 
fertilizer! At the moment we have to buy it, and we want to save these 
costs.


What is the project goal and who is the project for?Within about 30 years - since the Sri Lankan government has 
approved the import of seeds and fertilizers - almost the entire 
knowledge of local farmers about organic farming methods got lost. We 
are disturbed about how mainly small farmers have become dependent on 
agrochemicals.
Our goals with THE GARDEN ESTATE are:


create jobs to secure several families' income,
create jobs in a healthy working environment,
spread the knowledge of organic farming methods (again)
set an example with THE GARDEN ESTATE: ""Look, it works. We can feed ourselves without agrochemicals and even make money."",
create a place of equality and integration in a country with a long 
civil war history: We welcome people of all ethnics, religions and 
genders!







How will we use the money if the project is successfully funded? We will transfer the funded amount directly to Sri Lanka and will immediately


buy three more cows,
start building a barn,
transport one bull, one cow and a calf, that we were given from the city of Negombo to THE GARDEN ESTATE and
buy milking equipment (milking machine, buckets, cans)

Our association in local and international organizations will allow us to enlist the participation of schools, churches, civic groups,
companies and institutions. We will encourage people everywhere to  make a modest recurrent
commitment to this global effort to save the world’s most critical
habitats.
 Every contribution counts now, but mostly we need your help in spreading the word. Please tell your friends and family and please come join us on this journey to a better future. This Is My Earth: It's the only one we have!

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi! I am a Boy Scout in Troop 103 Burlington, MA and a sophomore at Burlington High School. I am working towards my Eagle rank which is the highest rank you can get in scouting. This rank requires me to lead a group of people in a substantial project that benefits my local community. This is that project. I am going to lead my troop, friends, and family in constructing 3 large planting boxes and a fence behind Pine Glen Elementary School.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The plan is to build 3 - 16ft by 6ft raised planting boxes with a 22ft by 36ft fence to surround and protect the whole area from deer and rabbits. This area will be wheelchair accessible from the gate to the spacing between the boxes. All of this is being put together with cedar boards, which are very good for surviving the harsh conditions of the New England weather. The fence will be constructed with cedar boards and chicken wire and is designed to keep out unwanted animals. The planting boxes are also going to be filled with loam. This also means, however, that the materials and tools are projected to cost $2,100 USD. All money not used will go directly to the elementary school for purchasing gardening tools and plants. This is where you are going to make a big difference.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will allow all 6 grades (K - 5) in the elementary school to go out and plant their own plants. It will allow them to learn all about agriculture and how to actually grow the plants. It may inspire the kids to go on and help do things for the environment, which is much needed at this point.</p>

NOTE: One 'Loveable Loo' unassembled kit cost $185.. then we buid the privacy structure round it. In this setting we are going with these (take 6 gallon bucket) combined with self-build bigger seat-structure to contain 20 gallon bins.

The 'Loveable Loo' toilet is just one example of a 'humanure' toilet system; a system that is designed to deliver nutrient-rich sweet-smelling, safe soil; so, different from a straight-up compost toilet; humanure becomes soil and Yes; you can grow food in  :)

In contrast, poop in a porta potty is classified as  'hazardous waste', 'blackwater' (dangerous/deadly), when actually everything you eliminate is designed to turn into healthy soil, given half a chance!!
""It's proper to refer to this as 'nutrients"" says John Forrest Dohlin, of fabulous Bronx Zoo humanure toilets (no red-tagging needed here!)'TOILETS OF WHIMSY' is the funnest, most rad thing since the pogo stick. Poop is proving pure and popular in its profound and pollution-free particulates, gracefully fulfilling Rob Brezsny's Pronoia* prediction. 
We are inspired by Loveable Loos & Bronx Zoo & 'Natural Event', to show-by-design that non-chemical cradle-to-cradle** portable/mobile latrines are an inspirational and paradigm-shifting alternative to chemical 'porta-potties', most especially at natural events where folk gather together to eat, pray, love, and poop.

We are building Toilets of Whimsy.
This is a Mooovement; Elimination is a NATURAL EVENT...; which is why Australian environmental chemist Hamish Skermer calls his operation 'Natural Event' -""changing the world from the bottom up!"" (see link to Hamish documentary trailer below, inlcuding bringing this knowledge to Haiti). Hamish is a true Profound Fool. 
 
Thank You Hamish also for the encouragement to re-think elimination time {being Peace as you s(h)it}.
""I am goodness and mercy and compassion and understanding.. peace and joy and light.. forgiveness and patience, strength and courage, a helper in time of need, a comforter in time of sorrow, a healer in time of injury, a teacher in times of confusion... the deepest wisdom and the highest truth; the greatest peace and the grandest love..."" ""You are these things. And in moments of your life you have known yourself as these things. Choose now to know yourself as these things always.""; {from CWG) 
RELIEVE YOURSELF ~ SWEET RELIEF Who knew that human poop could turn into sweet-smelling loamy compost in a season, with all pathogens rendered utterly harmless. Sweet rich loam soil  restored to us; that's Cradle-To-Cradle!
 Everybody Knows; access to clean drinking water saves lives, particularly children's lives {thank Goodness for every tenderhearted man and woman in the archaic battlefields of our World}. 
Sanitation, like water, is a keystone for thrival-survival. Poorly handled poop gets into groundwater and thus, access to clean drinking water is UNDONE. 
This knowledge has EVERYTHING to do with the Waters of the Earth and access to clean drinking water for all - talk to 1000 Hummingbird women for the waters and they will tell you (bless their hearts).  
We are learning anew the tenets of natural law and it is changing governmental health & safety regulations for the 21st Century.
In this project we are bringing beautiful toilets to 1000 Hummingbirds late Spring event out in the field.  We are fashioning little shrine/thrones(4) with colors and whimsy. Total funds we raise will determine fabrication options but asthetically pleasing is a core criteria.
The Damanhur Temples of Humankind in Italy were built without power tools. We may not be quite so purist but still, we are building shrines.
Note this is a 'flexible funding' campaign, meaning we get to keep whatever level of funds we raise, and will create these toilets for 1000 Hummingbirds come what may!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h2>Together we can bring back the bees by creating 100 new colonies.</h2>
<p>Bee Friends Farm is a family and friends enterprise dedicated to preserving bees and producing the finest all natural raw honey. Since 2006 about a third of all Amercan honeybees have vanished, victims of pesticides, mites, climate change and preditors. Without bees and their polination of a wide variety of food and plants, all living creatures suffer. Recently we lost hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of our bees to pesticides from a nearby farm. We want to do all we can to restore and increase our bees, but we need your help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We have the expertise and we are willing to do the hard work. </h3>
<p>It costs about $225 to create a new bee colony, and we plan to create 100. We know how to do it, and we certainly are willing to work hard to make it happen. Fortunately, with your help, we know we can restore our bee populations and even increase them. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The bees have wonderful rewards for you.</h3>
<p>Amazingly, it is the bees themselves who will show their appreciation by producing incredibly healthy and delicous all natural raw honey that we will help them share with you. For as little as a $25 contribution, you can get a bottle of some of the finest honey in America delivered right to your door anywhere in the continental US. If you are able to contribute even more, we have other excellent rewards, including our smooth, spreadable creamed honey. Let the bees show their undying thanks. </p>
<p>Even if you are not able to contribute, we appreciate your concern for the plight of the bees. Like so many of the complex components of our environment, the bees play a vital role in the health of us all. So, bee happy, bee healthy and bee friends with the bees!</p>

<h3><strong>How We Got to Here</strong></h3>
<p>Spalding Timber began to fell 110 acres of second growth trees in Crepsi Gulch on June 18<sup>th,</sup> 2012. In the following week a well-coordinated community responded by holding commercial logging responsible for its negative impact on the land. As millions of dollars of heavy machinery began to crush the hillside, hundreds of calls and letters began to flood the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife, and the Water Resource Department ofJackson county.</p>
<p>The first victory required Spalding Timber and the contracted loggin company, Rick Robertson Inc., to preform dust abatement on Yale Creek, spraying water on 6 miles of dirt road daily. The Oregon Forest Practices Act requires dust abatement during timber harvests, but as Otis Blankenship at the Forest Service said to Jonathan Major a resident of Yale Creek, ""We have caved in to the residents demands, now we must concede to timber."" Otis' concession to timber was that, without proper multi agency approval Spalding and Rick Robertson Logging Inc. would be able to punch a road through protected owl corridor along the creeks in order to siphon water. In this scenario a national forest creek will be drained to keep costs down on the harvest and marketing of a private entity. In the words of Mr. Blankenship, this was “protocol!”</p>
<p>Not so fast, dude! In the days to follow, farmers and homesteaders with deeded water rights on Yale Creek got in contact with the Water Resource Department. On Tuesday, June 26th, a representative of the Water Master visited Yale Creek, and informed Spalding and company that they were indeed siphoning water illegally. Spalding would now be required to bring water from Medford, 25 miles away, for dust abatement in order to legally move 600,000 board feet of Crepsi timber from the hill to the mill, a cost of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>That same day Lydia Doleman, another Yale Creek resident,  documented and presented a power point presentation to Bob Marku at ODF regarding turbidity in Crepsi Creek as a result of logging equipment routinely driving directly through an ""F"" class fish-bearing stream, in deference to the timber harvest plan. Turns out that after 20 years with the forest service Bob Marku had become pretty close with the Spalding operator, and in lieu of citing Spalding for an obvious breech of contract, ODF required that Spalding bring 2 more dump loads of rock to line the creek. Things were beginning to add up for Spalding. At a paltry of 500 dollars per thousand board feet of lumber this job was not panning out. Protest banners were beginning to adorn the roadways, the neighborhood promising that the local population would not pay to finance any part of this operation.</p>
<p>On June 27th Spalding offered to sell 110 acres of mature forest adjacent to the Siskiyou Crest for $156,000, and one wek later they withdrew from the property, having harvested a painful 8 acres, while leaving a breathtaking 102 acres intact, full of life, fertility and wild song.</p>
<p>   The task ahead of us is the purchasing and placement into trust the 110 acres. Can you help? The Applegate Partnership Watershed Council has agreed to hold the funds as a nonprofit, 501(c)3, making <strong>all donations tax deductible</strong>. With your help Speak for the Trees can take 110 acres of high mountain Siskiyou forest, the habit that it provides, and the water that it filters out of the cycle of industrial logging, placing it into the hands of a non-profit with a diverse board of directors, of which you will be an integral part. In the name of all who come next, animals, trees, humans, fish, birds wind and water, FOREVER WILD, FOREVER FREE!!</p>

Nicolas Rivoire, 29 years
old, French photographer.


""My current project is about Patagonia. I
have already been there and I know how beautiful, wild, remote, and intense it
can be. 
But today, this part of the world, one of the last wild places that
exist on this planet, is threatened. Chile's government has started a project, called
HidroAysÃ©n, which consists in building 5 huge dams on two major
Chilean Patagonian rivers. 



Fortunately, Chilean people have struggled and the project
is now interrupted, suspended to the decision of the Supreme Court of Chile, waiting
for additional data about the ecological impact that such a project could have....recently the Chilean government started to discuss with Argentina to send
electrical power lines through their country. 

Then, with one of my best friends, Abdel,
who has already spent 18 months in the southern part of Argentina, I want to do
a report in this region. Abdel will write and I will take the pictures. 

Far
from the clichÃ©s, the postal card pictures of the traditional gauchos (i.e.: the
Patagonian cow-boys), what I would like to discover is the actual way of life
of the inhabitants of this region. What I would like to show is the unknown and
under-covered story: how the people over there manage to live a quite simply
life with still a strong relationship with nature, which is a knowledge that
most of us have lost over the past decades. What are their dreams? 

What do they
expect for their future since they refuse the so-call progress? Could an
alternative exist to meet the government's goal of a 6% percent growth per
year?  Would the people take advantage of it
?

By helping us, funding this campaign, you
would not only help two young reporters to do their job and hopefully, be
published, but you would also help to spread the word, you will help people to
be aware of one ignored and major both environmental and human issue, and I
think that it is worth it ! 
Thank you !""

sauvage que le territoire lui-mÃªme. La Patagonie, aujourdâ€™hui menacÃ©e par des
projets fous, faits de barrages gÃ©ants et de lignes haute-tension.

Â« Patagonia sin represas Â», tel est donc le mot

<p>Hey all, Rodman here. Nearly a year ago I had a life-altering awakening. I had never been the kind of guy who intentionally abused the planet on which I live, but when I took a step back and looked really hard at the carbon footprint that I had developed, I became quite alarmed. Where I would typically think, ""what difference can one person make"", I started to realize that if everyone thought this way, our planet would be in dire straights!</p>
<p>So, I set out on a mission to learn about how I can be a better steward of our planet. I decided to learn about the most extreme sustainable practices (from the most extreme people), then decide which of these practices are practical, and can have the most positive impact. In doing so, I began to learn that there are hundreds of small changes I can make, that will have a considerable positive impact on our world.</p>
<p>But why go through this process alone? If I could make a positive global impact by myself, why not bring these practices to the world so that we can make change on a global level? This is where PBS comes in. PBS has agreed to air The Urban Conversion. However, due to limited PBS funding, we need your help bringing this mission alive. We need your to help us change the world, and bring about positive environmental change!</p>
<p>The Urban Conversion was recently invited to the White House, to learn about the White House garden, and what is being done on a federal level to educate the nation on eating healthly.  This is a message that is being passed to adults and children alike.</p>
<p>Being invited to the White House is a tremendous opportunity, which will allow us to work with White House Chef Sam Kass, and educate our audience about urban agriculture at the highest level.  Our staff is very excited about this opportunity and ready to bring a tremendous show to the PBS audience.  In order to produce the show, we are looking to raise $20,000.  This covers the hard costs associated with the full production, from travel, to videography to the final edit.  We have assembled a crew of incredible professionals to bring this one-hour special episode of the program to life.</p>

Hey all, Rodman here. Nearly a year ago I had a life-altering awakening. I had never been the kind of guy who intentionally abused the planet on which I live, but when I took a step back and looked really hard at the carbon footprint that I had developed, I became quite alarmed. Where I would typically think, ""what difference can one person make"", I started to realize that if everyone thought this way, our planet would be in dire straights!
So, I set out on a mission to learn about how I can be a better steward of our planet. I decided to learn about the most extreme sustainable practices (from the most extreme people), then decide which of these practices are practical, and can have the most positive impact. In doing so, I began to learn that there are hundreds of small changes I can make, that will have a considerable positive impact on our world.
But why go through this process alone? If I could make a positive global impact by myself, why not bring these practices to the world so that we can make change on a global level? This is where PBS comes in. PBS has agreed to air The Urban Conversion. However, due to limited PBS funding, we need your help bringing this mission alive. We need your to help us change the world, and bring about positive environmental change!
The Urban Conversion was recently invited to the White House, to learn about the White House garden, and what is being done on a federal level to educate the nation on eating healthly.  This is a message that is being passed to adults and children alike.
Being invited to the White House is a tremendous opportunity, which will allow us to work with White House Chef Sam Kass, and educate our audience about urban agriculture at the highest level.  Our staff is very excited about this opportunity and ready to bring a tremendous show to the PBS audience.  In order to produce the show, we are looking to raise $20,000.  This covers the hard costs associated with the full production, from travel, to videography to the final edit.  We have assembled a crew of incredible professionals to bring this one-hour special episode of the program to life.
We invite you to come along for the ride, and join us in these critical efforts to bring positive change to our world.
What is The Urban Conversion Series?
First and foremost, The Urban Conversion is not another ""preachy"" environmental television series. The show educates viewers in a fun and light hearted manner. It brings a ""city-slicker"" out of his office, and into a world of change.
From raising chickens and goats in the city, to the most unique green lifestyles, host Rodman Schley makes the ultimate conversion from his current urban business lifestyle, to an off-the-grid urban homestead.
The Urban Conversion is best described as homesteading in an urban environment for dummies, and show host Rodman Schley is the ultimate dummy!

<p>We've called it the Window on the Wetlands (WOW) Centre as it sits beside the Tiger Bay Wetlands, a wonderful boutique wetland with walking trails, interpretive signage and a bird hide. While I'm now the CEO of RiverSmart, previously I was the Deputy Secretary-General of the Ramsar Wetlands Convention and so I've seen centres like the one we're trying to create here all over the World. We're taking the best ideas from those other centres and trying to apply them here. </p>
<p>Last year, with crowd funding support, local donations and fund-raisers, plus a benefit concert by Australian country music star Sara Storer, we raised $60,000 to save from demolition, and then relocate, a 120 years old timber church to our site. It has now been refurbished with the help of funds from the NSW Government, local community organisations and tradies. </p>
<p>The next stage, for which we are seeking crowd funding help again, is to add covered verandas to the former church hall (to protect our interpretive boards) and to install seven outdoor information shelters.  Each shelter will have eight panels and the themes proposed for these include the amazing biodiversity of the region, the Macquarie marshes, introduced pests and weeds, catch and release fishing (this river has several threatened fish species), regional farming enterprises and how to be a RiverSmart farmer, early European explorers and history and the cultural connections of the Indigenous Wailwan people of Warren and surrounds to the river and  wetlands. Through grants we've received the Aboriginal artists of Warren are currently painting several totem poles to be part of the outdoor exhibitions (see Youtube clip), plus the local lead-lighting group are working to create lead-light windows of wetland species to be installed in the Centre. </p>
<p>We've estimated we'll need $Aud 50,000  to undertake these installations. This is just for the construction and we will provide our own time and resources, with help from experts, to develop the content of the interpretive signage.  Each stand-alone interpretive shelter is estimated to cost $Aud 4,000 to build and the two verandas, with ramps for disabled person access, approximately $Aud 22,000 for the materials.  A local business has already pledged support for constructing the verandas by donating the labour. </p>
<p>Our vision is to have over 1,000 school children per year coming to the site for hands-on education at our Centre made even more real by being able to take them to the Tiger Bay Wetlands beside our site.  Plus, we hope to attract up to 5,000 visitors annually to our Centre to help them learn about the critical importance of sustaining rivers and wetlands, and how the threats to them could escalate, including if climate change predictions for this region are realised. </p>
<p>Through our related Macquarie River Trails initiative (<a href=""http://www.rivertrails.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rivertrails.com.au</a>) we promote sustainable eco-tourism of the river and surrounds, plus in a few months we hope to be able to offer visitors the opportunity to 'get up close and personal' with the Macquarie Marshes through guided tours. </p>
<p>We are moving at present to form a locally-based Task Force to oversee this stage of developing the WOW Centre and to then act as an ongoing management committee. This will ensure sound use of any funds raised and further enhance local ownership for this venture and all it seeks to achieve. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our full funding raising target, smaller amounts will allow progress to be made. For example, each $4,000 will build one interpretive shelter. </p>
<p>Why is this project important?  Globally wetlands are increasingly under threat. Much of this is caused by small decisions in river, or nearby land management, that when combined magnify to increase pressure on wetlands which sees them slowly degraded or reduced in size.  The WOW Centre aims to educate people from all walks of life about why wetlands are so vital and what they can do individually, as a family or business operator, to make a difference.  </p>
<p>We also see the WOW Centre as being a place to offer adult education and training programs targeting those working in water and land management including the farming community. These programs will help encourage application of best practice management to lessen the threats to the Macquarie River and Marshes, which the locals all openly state are the lifeblood of this region. </p>
<p>The WOW Centre is also important for the small community of Warren, with a population of about 2,500. Such communities across the inland of Australia are struggling as their populations age, the younger people move to the bigger centres for jobs and small businesses struggle to stay open faced with competition from the larger regional centres (in this case Dubbo in particular). Warren is a community built on agriculture and while this will remain the case into the future, climatic and market uncertainties mean this community must diversify it's income streams if it is to remain viable. By encouraging people to visit the WOW Centre, and to stay a few nights to absorb all about the river and Marshes, plus the rich cultural heritage of the region, there will be significant economic and social benefits for the town. </p>
<p>So, please consider helping us achieve our vision. Plus, also tell your friends about us and our dream of creating the WOW Centre in Warren and to put on their 'bucket list' to visit to this town and take the chance to see the remarkable Macquarie Marshes. </p>

The North Oakland Headwaters Land Conservancy (NOHLC) is a private, non-profit, community supported, citizen run organization with 40 years experience in preserving open space in northwest Oakland County and nearby communities. During our existence, we have successfully acquired over 1,400 acres in six townships and two counties. These land parcels range from 1/2 acre to over 100 acres. Our ongoing mission is to conserve the woods, fields, streams, and other natural resources in the headwaters area of the Clinton, Shiawassee, Huron, and Flint Rivers.

<h2>Story: </h2>
<p>My father recently retired after over 40 years in the civil engineering mostly in the energy sector. With a lot of time on his hands, I encouraged him to give something back. He called me over to his house one day and brought me into his backyard beholding a shiny object in the middle of the yard. I asked what it was, he said, “it’s a solar cooker I made.” I was baffled until he explained that, yes, you can cook with ONLY the energy of the sun. With a pitch-black pot in the middle absorbing maximum heat, he was able to cook rice, lentils, fish, and vegetables with only this source of energy. Zero emissions, zero cost for fuel, zero hassle.<br/>He explained to me that anyone can use this product, but the people who need it most are the needy people of the world who can only cook with coal and firewood, which causes repertory problems. As a full-time non-profit relief worker, I was ecstatic about what this means to the people all over the world. No more risk of kidnapping while gathering wood. No more depleting of scarce forestry. No more wasted nutrients because of high heat cooking. This was the solution, right in front of me. The vision overtook my peripheral and the family is now on a path to provide this to the whole world, along with other cutting edge innovations for solar relief (i.e. solar kettle, solar lantern etc.).</p>

<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">About the Film</span></strong></h3>
<p>The film tells the inspiring story of a sustainable agro-forestry community in Trinidad, West Indies, called Fondes Amandes, led by a charismatic woman, Akilah Jaramogi (pictured above). Three decades ago Akilah settled on a barren, deforested hillside, blighted with floods in the rainy season and fires in the dry season. Together with her late husband, Tecumah, they started a family and reforested over 150 acres, restoring health to the hills and the watershed just outside the capital city of Port-of-Spain. When her husband died, Akilah continued this great work, initiating the Fondes Amandes Community Reforestation Project (FACRP), training community members as stewards of the forests and waters. Today Fondes Amandes is a thriving village atop a flourishing forest of 150 acres where residents have planted thousands of seedlings over the past thirty years. The community is visited by international dignitaries and Akilah is heralded as the Wangari Maathai of Trinidad. This film will tell the story of Akilah, the Fondes Amandes villagers and their remarkable achievements, serving as an educational, activist and inspirational tool for students, educators, NGOs and other communities worldwide.</p>

– Edgar CayceThe dream is to protect 11,000 hectares (27,000+ acres) of primary old-growth forest in the southeastern Peruvian Amazon, part of the Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot – the most biologically diverse habitat on Earth.  Home to 1,400 species of butterfly and 45,000 plant species (the next most diverse location hosts 25,000 plant species, by comparison) – as well as many threatened and endangered species including the giant river otter, spider monkey, black caiman, and harpy eagle – it also serves as a buffer between civilization and uncontacted indigenous tribespeople.This area is located near the newly paved Interoceanic Highway, a major trade route across South America. The highway brings serious threats to the ecosystem and threats to the long-term economic stability of the region.Making This Dream A RealityThe dream of protecting this important region of the rainforest is within reach. With support from both local and global communities, the ARCC team has engaged a solid strategy to ensure the success of this project.Phase 1: CompletedEngage the community to understand local needs, develop networks, and program priorities. Lay the legal groundwork for the land purchase. Set up an organization to manage and facilitate the conservation efforts once the land has been purchased. Create media aimed at sharing the beauty and importance of this magical place. (Visit ARCtv for more videos.)Phase 2: March 2014Purchase the first 1,000 hectares, the eco-tourism concession. This is the future home of ARCC, the Amazon Research and Conservation Center. Your contributions will make this phase possible. US based non-profit, Wild Forests and Fauna, will match your donation to ARCC. Together we can raise the last 25% needed to purchase the first 1,000 hectares!Phase 3: December 2015Protect the resource rich 10,000 hectares, conservation concession surrounding the first 1,000 hectares. The entire area is over 27,000 acres. See Context and Maps. We have a strategy in place to secure this second land purchase and continue to work with local and international partners in order to protect the Madre de Dios Region of Peru and other threatened environments.Where Will Your Money Go?Phase 2...the purchase of the initial 1,000ha. We have a couple months to secure the last 25% - $50,000. If we raise $25,000 for Phase 2 by March 2014, Wild Forests and Fauna will match our donations dollar for dollar and we can purchase the first 1,000ha!  If we exceed our goal, the money goes to purchasing the additional 10,000 hectares surrounding the first concession.What If We Don’t Reach Our Campaign Goal?Even if we don’t achieve the goal for this campaign, this land is too important to stop trying.  This campaign is just one of several fundraising strategies we will engage over the next year. Stay in touch with us on Facebook and our website. We will keep you posted on our future efforts.What Is The Long Term Impact of ARCC?
Conserving 11,000 hectares of primary rainforest.
Providing unique rainforest wilderness experiences for thousands of new visitors.
Preserving the lives and cultures of indigenous communities.
Generating opportunities for communities and businesses here in Peru and all over the world.

After a lifetime of working in and exploring just about every continent except Antarctica, I was rich in experiences beyond imagine...technological marvels and nature at its finest.
 Mein Leben wurde durch mein Arbeiten in fast jedem Kontinent der Erde mit Ausnahme von Antarktika und Erforschen der Orte durch technologische Wunderwerke und die außergewöhnliche Schönheit der Natur immens bereichert. 
Hi, my name is Don and I believe that we can help the Planet to clean up the back yard we have messed up.
Hallo, ich heiße Don Stein. Ich glaube, daß wir unserem Planeten helfen können, sich zu erholen und  unseren irdischen Paradiesgarten, den wir gewaltig verunreinigt haben wiederherzustellen.
I have been fortunate to have gathered a team of experts and dedicated professionals that have identified technology that is readily available to create a clean, renewable and pollution free fuel. Mother nature has provided us with her secret recipe for clean pure energy and we need your help to bake this cake. 
Ich bin sehr froh in einem  Team von Experten und engagierten Profis an einer Technologie zu arbeiten, die einen erneuerbare und frei von umweltbelastenden Schadstoffen Treibstoff generiert. 
I was raised a country boy and am an equestrian rider with a horse named Betelgeuse and wooly Irish Wolfhound known as Bill. I have dived in many sea's and living along side nature has provided me with the conviction that man is the curator and voice for the animals on this Planet and we haven't done a very good job of looking after many of them.
Ich bin auf dem Land aufgewachsen und und bin passionierter Reiter von meinem Pferd Betelgeuse. Außerdem habe ich einen Irischen Wolfhound, Bill. Ich bin in vielen Gewässern getaucht und habe naturverbunden gelebt. Aus diesen Erfahrungen spricht in mir die Stimme, dass der Mensch als Stimme und Konservator der Tierwelt auf unserem Planeten eingesetzt ist. Bislang haben wir unsere Verantwortung dahingehend nicht ausreichend erfüllt.
With your donation's you can help us to construct and test the BLU LITE plasma hydrogen fuel system and begin to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. 
Mit Ihrem Beitrag können Sie uns helfen das BLU LITE Plasma Hydrogen Antriebssystem zu bauen und damit anzufangen, unsere Abhängigkeit von den fossilen Brennstoffen zu reduzieren.
We have completed the R&D phase of the Blu Lite hydrogen fuel system with great success and now move to the more costly phase of running a prototype jet engine running on water fuel.
Wir haben die Forschungs-und Entwicklungsphase des BLU LITE Hydrogen Antriebssystems mit großem Erfolg abgeschlossen und sind jetzt in der kostenintensiveren Phase der Herstellung des Prototyps des Triebwerks das auf Wasserstoff läuft. 
Your donations will also be matched by Blu Lite to an animal rescue or wildlife foundation, let's give back to our voiceless companions we share this Earth with and take a breath of fresh air once again.
Teile Ihrer Dotation warden von Blu Lite auch an eine Artenschutz oder einer renommierten Tierschutzsorganisation weitergespendet. Lassen Sie uns gemeinsam mit diesen Zeitgenossen, die sich nicht über Sprache artikulieren wieder in klarer und reiner Luft durchatmen.

The Impact
We have come to a tipping point on mankind's mismanagement of the Earth's resources and the well being of all that inhabit this Planet, our only home in the expanse of the Universe. 
A new paradigm is required if we are going to be sustainable for future generations and I believe that a clean renewable energy source is the key to the solution. I believe that man, nature and technology can work hand in hand to shape our World to a better place.
Blu Lite technology takes all the goodness nature has given us and we can return it back to its natural state...how good is that.
Die Auswirkungen
Wir sind an einem Wendepunkt der Menschheit Missmanagement von Ressourcen der Erde und dem Wohlergehen aller, die diesen Planeten bewohnen, unsere einzige Heimat, in der Weite des Universums kommen.Ein neues Paradigma ist erforderlich,wenn wir nachhaltig für künftige Generationen sind, und ich glaube, dass eine saubere, erneuerbare Energiequelle der Schlüssel zur Lösung ist. Ich glaube, dass der Mensch, Natur und Technik Hand in Hand arbeiten, um unsere Welt zu einem besseren Ort zu gestalten.
Blu Lite Technologie nimmt all die Güte der Natur uns gegeben hat, und wir können es wieder zurück zu seinem natürlichen Zustand ... wie gut das ist

</p><p>

We want to raise enough funding for 100 tribal members to start
butterfly farming this year.  We have
participants signed up and ready to go, and we have contracts in place to
purchase every butterfly raised in the program. 
All we need to make this project a success is funding for initial start-up supplies and a summer intern to
help with training and support.</p><p>

For every starting butterfly farmer we need the
following supplies:<br/></p><ul>
<li>“Pop-up” enclosures (2 large, 2 medium, 2 small) = $60.40</li>
<li>Seeds and flats for plants = $12.00</li>
<li>Dirt to grow host plants for caterpillars = $9.00</li>
<li>Initial butterfly breeding stock = $35.00</li>
<li>Bleach to sanitize supplies and prevent disease = $14.00</li>
<li>Sanitizing tub to sterilize pop-ups and plants = $12.00</li>
<li>Storage containers for chrysalides = $12.00</li>
</ul><p>Total start-up cost per butterfly farmer = $151.40</p><p>Cost for 100 starting farmers = $15,140</p><p>Salary cost for one summer intern = $4800   (40 hours per week helping with training and support for 12 weeks, at $10 per hour)  </p><ul><li>
Total Start-Up Funds Needed = $19,940</li></ul><p><strong>

If we reach our funding goal, we will be able to raise enough butterflies to generate $75,000 in income directly back to our farmers in
2014.  Even if we fall short, we will still be able to start one farmer in Natives Raising Natives for every $151.40 that we raise.</strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p>

We want to raise enough funding for 100 tribal members to start
butterfly farming this year.  We have
participants signed up and ready to go, and we have contracts in place to
purchase every butterfly raised in the program. 
All we need to make this project a success is funding for initial start-up supplies and a summer intern to
help with training and support.

For every starting butterfly farmer we need the
following supplies:
“Pop-up” enclosures (2 large, 2 medium, 2 small) = $60.40
Seeds and flats for plants = $12.00
Dirt to grow host plants for caterpillars = $9.00
Initial butterfly breeding stock = $35.00
Bleach to sanitize supplies and prevent disease = $14.00
Sanitizing tub to sterilize pop-ups and plants = $12.00
Storage containers for chrysalides = $12.00
Total start-up cost per butterfly farmer = $151.40Cost for 100 starting farmers = $15,140Salary cost for one summer intern = $4800   (40 hours per week helping with training and support for 12 weeks, at $10 per hour)  
Total Start-Up Funds Needed = $19,940

If we reach our funding goal, we will be able to raise enough butterflies to generate $75,000 in income directly back to our farmers in
2014.  Even if we fall short, we will still be able to start one farmer in Natives Raising Natives for every $151.40 that we raise.
Our Partners In addition to the Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, we have had an outpouring of support from many tribes and organizations interested in participating or helping the Natives Raising Natives Project. A few of them include:
Langston University
The Yuchi/Euchee Tribe
The Eufaula Indian Community
Kialegee Tribal Town
Alabama-Quassarte Tribal Town
The Muscogee (Creek) Nation Small Business Development Center
The Mvskoke Food Sovereignty Initiative
Seminole Indigenous Foods Project
The Cockrell Butterfly Center at the Houston Museum of Natural History
The Science Museum of Minnesota
The University of Minnesota Landscape Arboretum
The Desert Botanical Garden

Why Your Contribution is Important
Your gift will make a difference in so many ways.

It will allow a Native in rural Oklahoma to earn income who
otherwise might not be able to – a disabled Veteran, a stay-at-home mom, a
senior citizen of limited financial means.
It will allow visitors at butterfly houses all over the
United States to see gorgeous, rare native butterflies firsthand, to experience
for themselves why these treasures of the natural world are worth protecting.
It will allow a Native child to witness the miracle of metamorphosis,
possibly inspiring them to shoot for a career in biology, ecology or medicine.
It will provide summer employment to a youth where jobs are
scarce, giving him or her a crucial early introduction to the satisfaction and
responsibilities of being a paid worker.
It will give children everywhere touched by this project the
chance to connect with a butterfly instead of a video game, possibly being the
single most important reason why one day in the future they will choose to take
a stand for protecting our threatened animals, plants and ecosystems.Even If You Can't Donate, Please Consider Helping Us In Other Ways
We understand that you may not be able to make a financial
donation.  However, you can still make a
very valuable contribution towards our success when you spread the word about
Natives Raising Natives to your friends, family and co-workers by sharing this

<p>1) Gather baseline data on the pre-existing reef community on the Sumber Sari beachfront and use GIS (geographical information systems) to map the reef extent. </p>
<p>2) Provide recommended site selection for deploying additional reef substrate (locally sourced limestone). </p>
<p>3) Assist in deployment of additional limeston substrate</p>
<p>4) Develop and implement a reef monitoring plan for the Sumber Sari Community. At the moment, no monitoring plan exists for the local reef. The community cannot manage what they cannot measure. </p>

<br/><b>Why is the Mongolian Khulan endangered ? </b></span><p></p>
<p>Main threats
affecting the survival of the Mongolian Khulan are:</p>
<p>a) Habitat diminution and fragmentation,</p>
<p>b) Illegal hunting
and trade for its meat and skin (some organs seem to be also used in traditional medicine),</p>
<p>c) Competition
with domestic livestock to access to natural resources (water and pastures)
that are limited in the Gobi Desert,</p>
<p>d) Lack of knowledge by herders about this species ecology, </p>
<p>e) possible impact of climate change. <br/><br/></p>

The Mongolian
Khulan - also known as Mongolian Wild Donkey (Equus hemionus hemionus) – is
an endangered Asiatic wild Equid
which is still less known that the Przewalski's horse. The Mongolian Khulan is one the 5 recognized sub-species of the Asiatic Wild Donkey and represents the largest population of
this species in the world (80% of the species). Its
population is now mainly concentrated in south of Mongolia (Gobi Desert) with
small populations in north of China (Xinjiang province and Inner Mongolia). Mongolia represents a very important place for the
conservation of the whole species.


The Mongolian Khulan is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List and in the Mongolian red list of Mammals.
And is listed in Appendix
I of the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora) and in Appendix II of the CMS (Convention on Migratory Species).

The Gobi Desert 

The ecosystem of the Gobi is very specific
and also vulnerable but very few actions have been conducted until now to
conserve it, especially in the south-eastern part of the Gobi Desert of
Mongolia. 



Why is the Mongolian Khulan endangered ? 
Main threats
affecting the survival of the Mongolian Khulan are:
a) Habitat diminution and fragmentation,
b) Illegal hunting
and trade for its meat and skin (some organs seem to be also used in traditional medicine),
c) Competition
with domestic livestock to access to natural resources (water and pastures)
that are limited in the Gobi Desert,
d) Lack of knowledge by herders about this species ecology, 
e) possible impact of climate change. 
About the organizations 
Association GOVIIN KHULAN 

The Association GOVIIN KHULAN, which is a French nonprofit organization, has been established in 2007 with the aim to enhance protection of the endangered Mongolian Khulan and its habitat in partnership with local rangers and communities. This organization has been created in response of the lack of actions conducted to protect the endangered Mongolian Khulan, and this particularly in the southeast Gobi (Mongolia), where there were fewer actions towards this species protection before. Goviin Khulan has built a multidisciplinary approach that will help ensure this species protection on a long term, with respect for local culture and traditions. We have secured support since the beginning from some local rangers, local governments, schools, two Buddhist monasteries and the local community of our study area.

<h3>Our Project:</h3>
<p><strong>What are our objectives?</strong></p>
<p><span>The objective lies in understanding the potential of <em>entomophagy</em> (i.e. the consumption of insects) to provide an environmentally sustainable solution to malnutrition for communities with low protein intake.</span></p>
<p><strong>What is the Importance of edible insects? </strong></p>
<p><span>Edible insects generally offer higher or similar nutritional quality compared to other forms of livestock, but have a lower consumption of energy and natural resources. they also multiply and grow quicker. Instead, livestock production, including feed-crop production, uses up 70% of the world’s agricultural land, and consumes 77 million tonnes of plant or animal protein to produce just 58 million tonnes of protein for human consumption annually. Obviously, on the long term, the numbers do not add up! For low income communities, low protein intake is one of the main causes of malnutrition which severely restrain a healthy development. </span></p>
<p><em>Hence, in a world were resources are becoming scarce and population is growing, entomophagy is an option which deserves urgent global attention. </em></p>
<p>Even in the developed world, there is an increasing demand for edible insects, as these are seen as a solution to contribute positively to lowering our ecological footprint.</p>
<p><strong>What our project consists in?</strong></p>
<p><span>Our project will take place in the North of Benin. We will be working with the Wama community to understand how they traditionally gather, sell, cook and consume insects. We will also explore the ecological implications of the currently used methods. In addition, to avoid the risk of over-exploiting natural stocks of edible insects in the case of the expansion of this practice, we shall devise methods for insect breeding that can be applied locally and in other communities.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Who's in the team?</strong> </span></p>
<p>Our team members are Laura, Rudi and Mariangela. Let's introduce these lovely people: <strong>Laura</strong> is the project leader and initiator of this expedition. Her and <strong>Rudi</strong> are true insect lovers, and have been studying them throughout the years as part of Evolutionary Biology and Integrated Pest Management. They are in charge of the scientific aspects of the project, together with <strong>Craig, </strong>which is the environmental scientist and science communicator specialist of the team. He will not only look at environmental significance of edible insects, but also be strongly involved in the diffusion and communication of results. <strong>Mariangela</strong> has specialized in the field of International Development and Environmetal Development Planning. For this project, she will focus on the interpersonal, community and developmental aspects of entomophagy, and prospects for further development projects.</p>
<p>We have been friends for years, and this project has reunited us all around a cause we all strongly believe in. We are passionate about environmental issues, and bringing effective solutions to start building a sustainable solution accessible to those who most need it. We have often traveled around the world and took part in previous projects and expeditions, for example in Mexico and Ghana. We are fully ready for the challenges ahead of us and are eager to bring back fascinating results.... we just need one final thing: <em>your support!</em></p>
<p><strong>How YOU can help!</strong></p>
<p>We are currently seeking grants and fundraising for the project. Your contribution can make a great difference to support our wonderful initiative and help us further our plans for the expedition.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Our Project:
What are our objectives?
The objective lies in understanding the potential of entomophagy (i.e. the consumption of insects) to provide an environmentally sustainable solution to malnutrition for communities with low protein intake.
What is the Importance of edible insects? 
Edible insects generally offer higher or similar nutritional quality compared to other forms of livestock, but have a lower consumption of energy and natural resources. they also multiply and grow quicker. Instead, livestock production, including feed-crop production, uses up 70% of the world’s agricultural land, and consumes 77 million tonnes of plant or animal protein to produce just 58 million tonnes of protein for human consumption annually. Obviously, on the long term, the numbers do not add up! For low income communities, low protein intake is one of the main causes of malnutrition which severely restrain a healthy development. 
Hence, in a world were resources are becoming scarce and population is growing, entomophagy is an option which deserves urgent global attention. 
Even in the developed world, there is an increasing demand for edible insects, as these are seen as a solution to contribute positively to lowering our ecological footprint.
What our project consists in?
Our project will take place in the North of Benin. We will be working with the Wama community to understand how they traditionally gather, sell, cook and consume insects. We will also explore the ecological implications of the currently used methods. In addition, to avoid the risk of over-exploiting natural stocks of edible insects in the case of the expansion of this practice, we shall devise methods for insect breeding that can be applied locally and in other communities.
Who's in the team? 
Our team members are Laura, Rudi and Mariangela. Let's introduce these lovely people: Laura is the project leader and initiator of this expedition. Her and Rudi are true insect lovers, and have been studying them throughout the years as part of Evolutionary Biology and Integrated Pest Management. They are in charge of the scientific aspects of the project, together with Craig, which is the environmental scientist and science communicator specialist of the team. He will not only look at environmental significance of edible insects, but also be strongly involved in the diffusion and communication of results. Mariangela has specialized in the field of International Development and Environmetal Development Planning. For this project, she will focus on the interpersonal, community and developmental aspects of entomophagy, and prospects for further development projects.
We have been friends for years, and this project has reunited us all around a cause we all strongly believe in. We are passionate about environmental issues, and bringing effective solutions to start building a sustainable solution accessible to those who most need it. We have often traveled around the world and took part in previous projects and expeditions, for example in Mexico and Ghana. We are fully ready for the challenges ahead of us and are eager to bring back fascinating results.... we just need one final thing: your support!
How YOU can help!
We are currently seeking grants and fundraising for the project. Your contribution can make a great difference to support our wonderful initiative and help us further our plans for the expedition.


What We Need & What You Get
Your contributions will be directed towards covering the expedition costs. 
This includes: plan tickets, visas, vaccinations and medical expenses, medical equipment, field equipment, renting of a vehicle and fuel expenses in order to reach remote destinations in which we will be working, renting a house that will serve as headquarters, a local guide to help us with the language and customs of the area, and living costs. Nothing more, nothing less!
To thank you for your contributions, we offer unique and exciting perks directly from Benin! Alternatively you can also just leave a contribution of any amount you decide.
The perks include: a picture with your name spelled out, a series of our ten most beautiful pictures, jewelry from Benin, a personalized video made when we are in Benin thanking you for your contribution, a copy of the report when it gets published, a copy of the film we will put together after the expedition
If ever we did not manage to reach our objective - be reassured! you will receive your money back!

<h2><strong>Who we are and what we do</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>Tethys Research Institute</strong> is a non-profit research organisation supporting marine conservation through science and public awareness, founded in 1986 and headquartered at the Civic Aquarium of Milano, Italy. Tethys’ main goal is the conservation of the marine environment, achieved through the provision of scientific knowledge to conservation policy, the participation in the international conservation process, and public awareness.</p>

<li>research on factors threatening the local ecosystems, particularly excessive fishing;</li>

The Tethys Research Institute is a non-profit research organisation supporting marine conservation through science and public awareness, founded in 1986 and headquartered at the Civic Aquarium of Milano, Italy. Tethys’ main goal is the conservation of the marine environment, achieved through the provision of scientific knowledge to conservation policy, the participation in the international conservation process, and public awareness.
In 1991 the Tethys launched the Ionian Dolphin Project (IDP) in the Inner Ionian Sea Archipelago (Greece), initially intended to be a long-term investigation of the ecology and behaviour of common dolphins in one of the species’ few remaining Mediterranean strongholds. During the ensuing decades the study documented the common dolphins’ sharp decline, in contrast to the more or less stable condition of the more adaptable bottlenose dolphins, and the presence of monk seal hotspots having a Mediterranean importance.

<h3>I am a film activist attempting to warn the worldwide community about the danger of the radiation coming from Fukushima. At least 4 nuclear reactors melted into the Pacific Ocean and jet stream in March 2011 but little was done to stop it or alert the people of the Northern hemisphere.  We have seen mutations and a spike in radiation-related deaths and illnesses since the accident. I have made several documentaries about the disaster.  Now I have set upon making a live action dramatic film to get the word out there as to what is really happening in Fukushima.  This is a bold attempt to inform the public from the danger they are not being alerted to by governments and most green groups even.   Please watch the trailer to our film called ""The Department"" and contribute to the production and distribution of the film.  We are halfway through filming and desperately require funds to finish it.  We have some volunteers but we are surviving on a skeleton crew and sometimes no crew at all.  Your contribution will help pay the actors and crew and get the film seen at film festivals .  I am the director, producer and writer of the film and have already spend thousands of dollars of my own funds to make this film.  We are setting a goal of $10,000.  Please contribute to this film and the health of the environment and to the well being of our kids and future generations.</h3>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Does Equinox Outdoor Public Kindergarten follows the Ontario curriculum?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Outdoor Kindergarten is part of the Toronto District School Board (TDSB) and follows all curriculum requirements, including those for early literacy and math. The inquiry-based educational model followed focuses on natural curiousity and nature as the springboard for all learning, and the importance of oral narrative and storytelling tradition. </p>
<p><strong>Do the children really go outside all winter?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Unless it's a severe weather condition, the children are outside. The key is to dress appropriately and keep moving. Of course, on the coldest days it's difficult for little hands to eat, and we come inside for snack time, rest, and other activities. The teachers respond to the needs of the children, and the transition to full-day in the fall will accomodate and indoor, early afternoon rest period. </p>

History of EMEM, which stands for Effective Microorganisms, was invented by Dr. Teruo Higa, a professor of horticulture from Okinawa, Japan. Dr. Higa invented EM over a 20 year period. EM finally came to market in the 1980s. It is now used in over 130 countries around the world, for crop production, odor control, septic maintenance, water and soil remediation, wastewater treatment and people and animal health.Bio:Linda Miyoshi is the East Coast sales representative for Teraganix, LLC, the sole distributor for authentic EM products in the US and Canada. She has a degree in agronomy. As well, she has a broad background in health from being a nurse to a practicing acupuncturist and herbalist. Since 2009 she has been working with farmers to help them incorporate EM technology into their agricultural programs with great success. She is in the process of opening up the first manufacturing facility for EM on the East Coast to make Effective Microorganisms more readily available to farmers and gardeners as well as others who wish to contribute to a healthier environment.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our project involves providing training facilities to the farmers in Pang village in the Parbat district of Nepal, and start farming of <i>Jatropha curcas </i>(Jatropha)<i>,</i> a plant capable of yielding biofuel bearing seeds. We intend to achieve
sustainable independent economic resource for unemployed manpower in the
locality by  employing five local manpower in production of Jatropha
seeds, and eventually motivate entrepreneurship in the locality to meet the
current energy and fuel demands.</p>
<p><span>Through our work, we are addressing two of the main
21<sup>st</sup> century issues – demand/need of sustainable energy and
unemployment. In the first 11 months of fiscal year 2010-11, Nepal imported petroleum
products worth 683.95 million USD Rupees. Meanwhile Nepal also recorded a total
export of 583.40 million USD (AEPC Nepal). Jatropha will become an
alternative solution to meet the immediate need and demand of fuel in Nepal. </span></p>
<p><span>As the unemployment rate of Nepal is 47% (World
bank), we will work to minimize it by hiring unemployed people. Parbat is one
of the growing districts in Nepal. Therefore, it is vital to shape the
population of the place so they are economically independent and are earning a
sustainable living. Majority Nepalese population’s livelihood is agro-based,
and Jatropha farming would be an ideal form of income generation. Initially, we
will be targeting a community of Pang village in the Parbat district of Nepal.</span></p>
<p><span>Starting January 3rd of 2015, we want to start our
foundation with locating a 5 acre land in Pang village owned by the local public school. Ideally, we would like
to start at a venue with access to transportation to expedite material transportation.
</span></p>
<p><span>Next, we would like to employ 5 locals who have
been in search of work. Instead of migrating away from their hometown, we will
offer those employed locals an alternative to stay and earn a living. </span></p>
<p><span>Simultaneously, with the help of experienced
Jatropha organization from capital Kathmandu, we want to initiate planting
seeds. We would be inviting volunteers from such organization to train employed
locals on planting and growing of Jatropha plants. An average Jatropha plant
takes specific periods to yield seeds and grow. We would need proper care from
the employed locals during this time. Locals will be trained on how to look
after the plant and learn about the plant. </span></p>
<p><span>After seeding, we plan to sell off the seeds to
biofuel organizations in the capital Kathmandu. With the revenue collected, we
plan to further invest on the plot of the land we already possess and
facilitate the growing of existing Jatropha plant. Similarly, the revenue collected by selling the seeds will be used for the further development of the school's infrastructure. Upon the analysis of the
work at the end of the first year, we will extend it in other communities as
well, hence employing and empowering more unemployed persons.</span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>The list of resources we need for
our project are:</p>
<p>1.  Jatropha Seeds $300</p>
<p>2.  Travel expenses in Nepal $200</p>
<p>3.  Expenses

<p>6.  Total

<p>As our project
mainly includes planting jatropha, we will need around $300 to buy those jatropha
seeds. Similarly, another important part of our project is getting training by collaborating
with different organizations and then training the local villagers to plant Jatropha in a scientific way. As the project
is going to be held in Pang, Parbat, we have to go there and stay in the field
for ten days. Likewise, we need to transport seeds and other
required material with us to the village, which adds us some cost. During the
stay, we need some funding for our food and accommodation as well. </p>

<h1><strong>Problem</strong></h1>
<p>We live in an age where everything from our computers to our disposable water bottles are made of plastic. It is all around us. But how disposable is that water bottle of yours?</p>
<p>Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, so despite throwing away that water bottle, it will still be around longer than you will. The current solution is recycling, but even with our best recycling efforts, <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/MSWcharacterization_508_053113_fs.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>91% of plastics still end up in landfills in the US</strong></a>. That's over 29 million tons of plastic every year! In fact, conservative estimates indicate the world disposes of over 73 million tons of plastic in landfills every year.</p>
<p>Landfills across the world are filling up fast and often times <a href=""http://www.plasticsindustry.org/AboutPlastics/content.cfm?ItemNumber=790&amp;navItemNumber=1124"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>more than 20% of the waste in a landfill is plastic</strong></a>. If we continue at this pace, we will need more landfills and where are we going to put them, in your neighborhood?</p>

<p>Plastics are everywhere in landfills!</p>

<p>PlasTek™ safely breaks down plastic molecules</p>
<p>The solution is a product called PlasTek™. PlasTek™ is an <strong>environmentally safe </strong>(Our team member Brock can even drink it!...trust us, it's no fruit smoothie) solution developed by Ph.D. chemists that is made from naturally occurring compounds that start decomposing plastics in a matter of months instead of hundreds of years.</p>
<p>As trash is thrown into a landfill, it will be sprayed with PlasTek™. Once the trash is sprayed with PlasTek™, it can be handled as normal and buried in the landfill. PlasTek™ will break the bonds of the plastic which will allow the naturally occurring bacteria in the landfill to digest it in <strong>12-36 months</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/752/640/b6dc188f5e7494a1dfd6b2755a45f33e_large.png?1374019885"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1>
<p>The first and most obvious benefit is that the plastics will break down at a faster rate and more space will be made available for a landfill. We estimate that we will save the average landfill over 80,000 cubic yards of space annually. This will allow us to increase the lifespan of current landfills, keep new landfills from being built, and keep your neighborhood safe from that horrible odor!</p>
<p>The second benefit is that the accelerated breakdown of plastic will cause an accelerated release of methane. Don’t think of this as a bad thing. All landfills are required to harvest this methane. <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/outreach/lmop/documents/pdfs/LMOPGeneral.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Over 500 landfills in the United States use this methane from landfills to generate green energy</a> and over 2000 landfills worldwide use this same technique. If you don’t think collecting gas from landfills is productive, landfills in 2009 alone collected over 13 billion kWhrs of electricity from methane gas! </p>
<p><img alt=""How landfills capture methane for clean energy!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/706/450/27038958e3e1942aaa4f96657d83bc04_large.gif?1372436490"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>How landfills capture methane for clean energy!</p>
<p>PlasTek™ is expected to increase the amount of methane landfills will capture by 124% -- that's an average of 4.12 megawatts of <strong>additional</strong> <strong>energy</strong> <strong>per landfill</strong>! That's enough energy to power 4,000 homes. <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/lmop/projects-candidates/lfge-calculator.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According to the EPA</a>, this additional energy reduces carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 19,480 tons. That's the equivalent of:</p>
<p><img alt=""PlasTek can really help the environment!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/716/028/90e4d72e6d7e6e62e88c09c01a688be5_large.jpg?1372787890"" src="""" style=""""/>PlasTek™ can really help the environment!</p>
<p>Many renewable energy projects are held up by the government and never reach financial stability without heavy government support. Using PlasTek™ is not just environmentally friendly but also financially responsible. After speaking with over 80 landfills, this is not something they will use out of mercy for the environment, but also for the 136% return on their initial investment. In other words, landfills don't loose money using PlasTek™, they make money! PlasTek™ is profitable for landfills and it helps the environment!</p>
<p><strong>PlasTek™ is a double win -- a win for the landfill, and a win for the environment.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Our Goal</strong></h1>
<p>Inviroment has won just over $100,000 in cash prizes from business plan competitions, including the <a href=""http://energy.gov/articles/celebrating-next-generation-energy-entrepreneurs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Department of Energy's CU CleanTech competition</a>. We need to raise $200,000 total in order to complete testing, including two pilot tests at landfills.</p>
<p>We have two landfills that have given us written permission to perform tests at their locations (Utah and Massachusetts). This is a mandatory test that will allow us to move forward with servicing other landfills. Until this pilot test takes place we will not be able to offer this service to any landfills due to cost and government requirements. After this test has taken place, we will be able to turn every landfill into a power producing and trash digesting machine!</p>

<span>Risks and challenges</span> </h3>
<p>We have faced many challenges as we have developed this product, such as raising $100,000 in capital to fund PlasTek™. However, we have a dedicated team that is capable of surmounting the obstacles we foresee on the horizon. Below we have mentioned some of these obstacles.</p>
<p>Pilot Test Organization- We recognize that a large scale pilot test, such as the one we are proposing, is a time-consuming and complicated ordeal. It will take several weeks/months of planning and several months to actually complete the testing and record the data. It will then take a couple of months to analyze the data. We are fully prepared to put in the time necessary to make this test a success, and we have several industry experts and advisers that have committed to help us as well.</p>
<p>Environmental Concerns - PlasTek™ has no anticipated negative effects on the environment. However, one of the reasons why we are on Indiegogo is to raise the funds needed to complete our pilot tests. With these pilot tests on actual landfills, we'll be able to closely monitor any potential hazards. We've already spoken with two experts at the EPA, and they are excited about PlasTek™ and think it will greatly benefit the environment.</p>
<p>Mailing Rewards- Though we hope to send out millions of rewards to our faithful backers, we recognize that this will take up much of our time in the weeks following the conclusion of our Indiegogo campaign. We will be working tirelessly to get those rewards in the mail so you can have those as soon as possible. The estimated date of delivery is only a worst case scenario, and we will work to get those prizes to you even quicker.</p>

We live in an age where everything from our computers to our disposable water bottles are made of plastic. It is all around us. But how disposable is that water bottle of yours?
Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, so despite throwing away that water bottle, it will still be around longer than you will. The current solution is recycling, but even with our best recycling efforts, 91% of plastics still end up in landfills in the US. That's over 29 million tons of plastic every year! In fact, conservative estimates indicate the world disposes of over 73 million tons of plastic in landfills every year.
Landfills across the world are filling up fast and often times more than 20% of the waste in a landfill is plastic. If we continue at this pace, we will need more landfills and where are we going to put them, in your neighborhood?

Plastics are everywhere in landfills!
Solution

PlasTek™ safely breaks down plastic molecules
The solution is a product called PlasTek™. PlasTek™ is an environmentally safe (Our team member Brock can even drink it!...trust us, it's no fruit smoothie) solution developed by Ph.D. chemists that is made from naturally occurring compounds that start decomposing plastics in a matter of months instead of hundreds of years.
As trash is thrown into a landfill, it will be sprayed with PlasTek™. Once the trash is sprayed with PlasTek™, it can be handled as normal and buried in the landfill. PlasTek™ will break the bonds of the plastic which will allow the naturally occurring bacteria in the landfill to digest it in 12-36 months.

Benefits
The first and most obvious benefit is that the plastics will break down at a faster rate and more space will be made available for a landfill. We estimate that we will save the average landfill over 80,000 cubic yards of space annually. This will allow us to increase the lifespan of current landfills, keep new landfills from being built, and keep your neighborhood safe from that horrible odor!
The second benefit is that the accelerated breakdown of plastic will cause an accelerated release of methane. Don’t think of this as a bad thing. All landfills are required to harvest this methane. Over 500 landfills in the United States use this methane from landfills to generate green energy and over 2000 landfills worldwide use this same technique. If you don’t think collecting gas from landfills is productive, landfills in 2009 alone collected over 13 billion kWhrs of electricity from methane gas! 

 
How landfills capture methane for clean energy!
PlasTek™ is expected to increase the amount of methane landfills will capture by 124% -- that's an average of 4.12 megawatts of additional energy per landfill! That's enough energy to power 4,000 homes. According to the EPA, this additional energy reduces carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 19,480 tons. That's the equivalent of:
PlasTek™ can really help the environment!
Many renewable energy projects are held up by the government and never reach financial stability without heavy government support. Using PlasTek™ is not just environmentally friendly but also financially responsible. After speaking with over 80 landfills, this is not something they will use out of mercy for the environment, but also for the 136% return on their initial investment. In other words, landfills don't loose money using PlasTek™, they make money! PlasTek™ is profitable for landfills and it helps the environment!
PlasTek™ is a double win -- a win for the landfill, and a win for the environment.
Our Goal
Inviroment has won just over $100,000 in cash prizes from business plan competitions, including the Department of Energy's CU CleanTech competition. We need to raise $200,000 total in order to complete testing, including two pilot tests at landfills.
We have two landfills that have given us written permission to perform tests at their locations (Utah and Massachusetts). This is a mandatory test that will allow us to move forward with servicing other landfills. Until this pilot test takes place we will not be able to offer this service to any landfills due to cost and government requirements. After this test has taken place, we will be able to turn every landfill into a power producing and trash digesting machine!

We've raised over $100K, but we need your help to reach $200K!

The Team
The Inviroment team at an international business competition
Can a team of Ph.D. chemists, an entrepreneur, and three students make a difference in the world? We believe we can! With proven science to support our efforts, Inviroment is ready to change the way the world handles waste. We're so close to completing our goal to help the environment, and you can help by supporting us through Indiegogo!

<h3>Save the Farm (from Drought)!</h3>
<p>Every fall, thousands of Burqueños (Albuquerqueans, to non-New Mexicans) come to Rio Grande Community Farm's (RGCF) Maize Maze event for a country farm escape in the middle of the city. The event features corn mazes with environmental education themes, pumpkin patches, and seasonal celebrations.</p>
<p>And it's the farm's biggest annual fundraiser. By a long shot.</p>
<p>In this, the state's third consecutive year of drought, RGCF is coming up short on our corn maze. Literally. With minimal precipitation and no irrigation water, even our drought-resistant corn crop is not growing well.</p>
<p>As our way of saying thanks for 17 years of community support, we want to continue our farm's tradition of fall celebration. But this year, we need a little extra help! We've integrated Fall Festival and Mini-Maze tickets into our perks as a way to jump-start this year's fundraising festivities, which are more ambitious than ever! They include:</p>
<p></p>

it! We have reached our first goal of $1000 and will be kicking off the 
filing process with the State of Florida and starting the work on our 
Federal application today. We can't thank everyone enough for your support and encouragement 
along the way. Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br/><br/>We are now off in
 pursuit of the second goal of reaching the $2000 mark so we can file 
our Federal application with the IRS. We're already over half way there 
and have no doubt we can succeed. <br/><br/>So, again, our sincere 
appreciation to all who have gotten us this far. We are on the way and 
we're going to do great things. We have you all to thank for that.<br/><br/><br/><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Are Doing</h1>eco-geeks.org is the social media face, originally organized in the gamer community, of what we hope will soon be a 
full-fledged 501(c)(3) non-profit working to crowd fund responsible 
conservation, scientific research, education and public awareness. It's 
an idea born of passion for the outdoors and wilderness (eco), with a thirst for scientific knowledge and understanding (geeks), combined with a
 heritage of public service. <br/><br/>Founded upon a family history and tradition of 
military and public service, philanthropy, and a deep appreciation of 
the land, scientific understanding, and education, we are now seeking to build this effort to the next level through the creation of a non-profit 
organization dedicated to this task: <b>The Brechin Heritage Foundation, Inc.</b><br/><br/>To that end, we are seeking to raise up to $2500 to help defray the legal, fiscal and bureaucratic costs of establishing a proper 501(c)(3) non-profit corportation through which we can achieve our stated goals. The mission statement for this new foundation is as follows: <br/><ul><li><i>The Brechin Heritage Foundation, in a continuation of
generations of public service and charitable work, is a family run volunteer
non-profit committed to intelligent conservation and preservation of threatened
ecosystems, the support of scientific research and education surrounding the
biodiversity they contain, and the development of public awareness of their
intrinsic value through the creation of sustainable and accessible eco-friendly
destinations and exploration programs.</i></li></ul><p>In a nutshell, the foundation will be volunteer run in order to maximize the benefit it creates. Unlike most, the Brechin Heritage Foundation is not, and never will be, a cash cow for its founders and board members. We will volunteer our time and donate the office space, equipment and travel it takes to run it. </p><p align=""center""><b><i>We will take no salary. We will file no expense reports.</i></b> </p><p>We will, instead, give of our time, energy, talent and resources in order to make it a success. Why, after all, should we ask others to donate to the cause if we are unwilling to give fully of ourselves? </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We will provide the sweat equity and the infrastructure. <br/>We ask of you only that you help us make it fiscally possible.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><h3><br/></h3><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h1>Our needs are quite simple... we
 need to fund the cost of getting the 501(c)(3) incorporated and

As much as this effort is about conservation, research and education, it is about awareness. Give what you can and spread the word... just a $1 donation and a few minutes sharing our links on social media and networking with family, friends and associates could reach our modest goal in a few hours. <br/></p><p><i><b>Anyone, rich or poor, can afford a single dollar... just skip your next can of soda or cup of coffee and take a few seconds to make an enduring difference in the world and our future.</b></i></p><br/><br/><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Perks<br/>

To make a contribution, just click on the perk you would like to receive and follow the bouncing ball. It will only take a moment to complete, your personal information will be safe, and you will make a positive difference. Again, even just $1 will help us reach our goal. Please give.<br/></p><p>The donation amounts given for each perk are the minimum amount for that perk. It is the minimum contribution we need to be able to purchase and ship the perk to you and still be able to further the cause.

Through your support of eco-geeks.org, and The Brechin Heritage Foundation,
 you can make a tangible difference in the future by preserving dwindling 
wilderness spaces, supporting the scientific understanding of the ecosystems 
they contain, fostering hands on education about these places and furthering public awareness as to their intrinsic value and beauty.<br/></p>The Brechin Heritage Foundation is not about knee jerk environmentalism, cynical green 'initiatives' cloaking ulterior motives, or global warming alarm-ism, and certainly is not anti-capitalism. We are not political and have no dogs in the endless infighting between entrenched camps across the spectrum of activism. We are not here to rattle cages, make noise or disrupt lives. We are here to quietly achieve positive results.<br/><br/>We are about three very simple things: intelligent and responsible conservation of limited resources, research and education, and public awareness. We have no desire to lock up great expanses of nature and throw away the key. There's little value in that. Rather, we seek to protect eco-systems that are at risk and then support the study and understanding of those eco-systems. But, more than that, we want to make them accessible to the public and to promote appreciation and understanding of their richness, beauty and diversity.<br/><br/>It does no good to take a thing you hold precious, hide it in a box and throw away the key. What is the point of having it? In due time it will be forgotten, its value unrecognized and, eventually, it will be lost, stolen or simply rot away. Who but the keeper remembers, or cares, that this special thing was tucked away? Who, besides the key bearer comprehends either its beauty or its intrinsic value? What becomes of it when the protector moves on? To be appreciated and valued, things must be observable, accessible and attainable or they will inevitably fade away into neglect and abandon.<br/><br/>With that in mind, at present and as already described in the ""<i><b>Stretch Goal</b></i>"" section (above), we are working on our first task: to conserve between 450 and 2000 acres of precious primary rain forest in Costa Rica. A short video about what makes a piece of the rain forest ""primary"" versus ""secondary"" and why it is important to conserve primary rain forest can be seen here:<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QqehvIYY3Mc?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>This is not about preventing the native Costa Ricans from using the land. They can. It is about protecting the land against future commercial development while making it accessible for scientific study as well as creating a destination where anyone who cares can experience it first hand. There is very little primary rain forest left in the world and we have little to no understanding of the biodiversity it contains. <br/><br/>So, these are the goals of the Brechin Heritage Foundation that you can help us achieve with your contributions and your support:<br/><ol>
<li>to identify at-risk eco-systems that can be responsibly and intelligently conserved</li>
<li>to support scientific inquiry of, and education in, those eco-systems</li>
<li>to make those eco-systems accessible to the public in a sustainable way</li>
</ol><br/><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">How You Can Help</h1><br/><ul>

<p>Why the ""Brechin"" Heritage Foundation? The answer to that question is history.</p>
<p>This family is directly descended from John Smith of Brechin, Scotland. Two of his sons, John and Peter Smith, emigrated to the United States in the early 1800s, leaving Scotland as dirt poor laborers and arriving in Boston (eventually settling in Andover, Massachusetts) with little more than their dreams and a willingness to work hard. The brothers created their own success and, then, gave it back in spades. They established a standard of giving and support of learning that endures to this day.</p>
<p>The Brechin Heritage Foundation name is a tip of the hat to the high standard they set through their love of the land, their humble beginnings, their honor, their hard work, their success and their willingness to give of themselves to help others, to conserve, to understand and to support education as a means to offer a better tomorrow for others, boys and girls alike, who would otherwise have never had the opportunity.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Heritage?</h1><p></p>
<p>Our family has deep roots in the history of this country aside from our ties to Brechin outlined above. We have been connected to the history of America from the Mayflower to the present. We have served in the military in every war from the American Revolution through the Civil War, both World Wars, and right down the line from Korea and Vietnam to today's War on Terror. From forgotten and penniless farmers and blacksmiths to storied Generals and leaders, we have lived and breathed the greater ideals of the Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>Love of country, the American dream, intellectual curiosity, charity, freedom and sacrifice mean something to every one of us. In our broader family, today, we have active duty and retired combat veterans, law enforcement, EMTs, registered nurses, volunteers, scientists, researchers, engineers, librarians, publishers, educators and artists. We are a hard working, grounded, inquisitive, creative, caring and giving people.</p>
<p>Compassion and service are in our genes as is ambition, a hunger for learning, and a drive to get things done. We have been born to serve, to protect and are motivated to leave the world a better place than we found it; as we have for generations. It is our intent to continue this long family tradition of service and giving through The Brechin Heritage Foundation. We see this as an opportunity to do great things, make a positive difference while continuing an enduring legacy of smart conservation, scientific curiosity and education.</p>
<p><i><b>Genealogy:</b> If you'd like to learn more about our family heritage, by all means Google for Peter D Smith of Andover, Massachussettes. We are also directly descended from Brigadier General Marlborough Churchill with distant relationships to Winston Churchill and General George B McClellan. You will find our family tied to Scientific American Magazine via Gerard and Jon Piel and a great deal more for those curious enough to explore our history. It's a fascinating and storied family tree for those who are intrigued by such things.</i></p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">With thanks to those who have gotten us this far...</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b><i>Our very first donor: Dämløk (Horde)</i></b><br/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Dandrenar (Alliance)<br/>Nasland: In honor and love of Temperance (Alliance)<br/>Lemirence (Alliance)<br/>To my sons, Patrick and Connor (Horde)<br/>Joshua Gelaude (Neutral)<br/>Nythyl, Night Elf Hunter, Antonidas (Alliance)<br/>Colby Beaver (Alliance)<br/>Tina Christian (Neutral)<br/>Patrick (Alliance)<br/>Baskal (Alliance)<br/>Kyo and Ithadwyn (Neutral)<br/>In memory of Pat Sharp, Singing with the Angels (Alliance)<br/>Gregory Huff (Alliance)<br/>Clint Yarborough (Neutral)<br/>Dan Holsen (Horde)<br/>Opuz (Alliance)<br/>Gina Clarke (Horde)<br/>The Mahans (Alliance)<br/>Lolo G-ma (Neutral)<br/>Ånhur of Signal Seven (Neutral)<br/>Galthis of Zangarmarsh and Feradrys of Earthen Ring (Neutral)<br/>Tom Schwarze (Horde)<br/>In memory of Anne Bullock (Neutral)<br/>in memory of Cowsgomoo (Horde)<br/>Stephanie Criddle (Neutral)<br/>Andy T (Horde)<br/>Steve Thornton (Alliance)<br/>Murray, Marion and Christine Smith (Horde)<br/>Jerod M.

We are, to be sure, continuing to move forward. We are incorporated in Florida, have our Board of Director's set up, bank accounts in place and paperwork in place for the IRS. It's just time.For those who missed the campaign, but still interesting supporting our cause, you can do so by cheque if you would like. Please make your check payable to:The Brechin Heritage FoundationP.O. Box 700725St. Cloud, FL 34770If you are a member of the nUIaddon.com web site, please be sure to let us know what your user name is on the site so that we can give you free access to the supporter's pages and features.27 January 2014 UpdateWith thanks to everyone who has done so much to help us get there, we have done it! We have reached our total funding goal for this leg of our conservation campaign: creating the non-profit. We have everything we need to complete the startup of the 'Brechin Heritage Foundation' and begin the true challenge of raising the funds to purchase this piece of primary rain forest and conserve it.From this point forward, 100% of all proceeds received (over and above the fixed costs of the perks that are selected) will be dedicated to securing the binding contract on the property. We're on to our stretch goal! We know we won't achieve it in the remaining hours of this campaign, but every dollar we collect now moves us one step closer to that goal.While we have achieved the primary goal of this specific campaign, we need to raise $300,000 to get a binding contract on the property. That's a tall mountain to climb and we need to start now. Please give and please know that from this point forward, every dollar is going straight toward that singular purchase. There are no salaries to be paid, no expense reports, no bills and no overhead... aside from the cost of your perks, every dollar now goes toward the conservation of this precious resource! Please, if you can, give. Even just $1 makes a difference. Do it.And, with that, our heartfelt thanks to everyone who has participated in this labor of love. We've come a long way and we're building a dream, one that will make a lasting difference in the world for generations to come. We have you to thank for that. We are humbled by your support.26 January 2014 Update
More happy news! We have reached our second funding goal of $2000 and now have sufficient funds to make our Federal application for 501(c)(3) status to the IRS. We are so excited to see this dream becoming reality. We cannot thank you enough.At the time of this writing, we are just 65 hours away from the end of the campaign and just $500 shy of our total funding goal. Every $1 of help matters. Please give if you can.6 January 2014 UpdateWe've done 
it! We have reached our first goal of $1000 and will be kicking off the 
filing process with the State of Florida and starting the work on our 
Federal application today. We can't thank everyone enough for your support and encouragement 
along the way. Thank you, thank you, thank you.We are now off in
 pursuit of the second goal of reaching the $2000 mark so we can file 
our Federal application with the IRS. We're already over half way there 
and have no doubt we can succeed. So, again, our sincere 
appreciation to all who have gotten us this far. We are on the way and 
we're going to do great things. We have you all to thank for that.What We Are Doingeco-geeks.org is the social media face, originally organized in the gamer community, of what we hope will soon be a 
full-fledged 501(c)(3) non-profit working to crowd fund responsible 
conservation, scientific research, education and public awareness. It's 
an idea born of passion for the outdoors and wilderness (eco), with a thirst for scientific knowledge and understanding (geeks), combined with a
 heritage of public service. Founded upon a family history and tradition of 
military and public service, philanthropy, and a deep appreciation of 
the land, scientific understanding, and education, we are now seeking to build this effort to the next level through the creation of a non-profit 
organization dedicated to this task: The Brechin Heritage Foundation, Inc.To that end, we are seeking to raise up to $2500 to help defray the legal, fiscal and bureaucratic costs of establishing a proper 501(c)(3) non-profit corportation through which we can achieve our stated goals. The mission statement for this new foundation is as follows: The Brechin Heritage Foundation, in a continuation of
generations of public service and charitable work, is a family run volunteer
non-profit committed to intelligent conservation and preservation of threatened
ecosystems, the support of scientific research and education surrounding the
biodiversity they contain, and the development of public awareness of their
intrinsic value through the creation of sustainable and accessible eco-friendly
destinations and exploration programs.In a nutshell, the foundation will be volunteer run in order to maximize the benefit it creates. Unlike most, the Brechin Heritage Foundation is not, and never will be, a cash cow for its founders and board members. We will volunteer our time and donate the office space, equipment and travel it takes to run it. We will take no salary. We will file no expense reports. We will, instead, give of our time, energy, talent and resources in order to make it a success. Why, after all, should we ask others to donate to the cause if we are unwilling to give fully of ourselves? We will provide the sweat equity and the infrastructure. We ask of you only that you help us make it fiscally possible.What We NeedOur needs are quite simple... we
 need to fund the cost of getting the 501(c)(3) incorporated and 
registered. Both the budget and the goals are very straight forward and modest:
Articles of incorporation: $125
Florida Secretary of State: $70
Federal Application: $500
IRS Fee: $850
Cost of perks: $750 (estimated)
IndieGoGo Overhead: $205 (estimated)
Total Budget: $2500PLEASE GIVE! Even a $1 donation makes a difference. And, honestly, we would rather see 2500 people give $1 than see just one person give $2500. As much as this effort is about conservation, research and education, it is about awareness. Give what you can and spread the word... just a $1 donation and a few minutes sharing our links on social media and networking with family, friends and associates could reach our modest goal in a few hours. Anyone, rich or poor, can afford a single dollar... just skip your next can of soda or cup of coffee and take a few seconds to make an enduring difference in the world and our future.Perks
As an incentive and a thanks for your support, we are offering several perks to contributors. They are all listed at the top right of this page and described in detail below. We have bumper stickers, posters, safari hats, t-shirts and hoodies you can select to help show your support for our goals and to help spread the word. To make a contribution, just click on the perk you would like to receive and follow the bouncing ball. It will only take a moment to complete, your personal information will be safe, and you will make a positive difference. Again, even just $1 will help us reach our goal. Please give.The donation amounts given for each perk are the minimum amount for that perk. It is the minimum contribution we need to be able to purchase and ship the perk to you and still be able to further the cause. You can choose to contribute more than the minimum mount, if you like, for any of the perks listed... just edit the dollar amount after you have selected the perk you would like to receive and set the amount you care to give. Likewise, you can choose more than one perk... just make a separate contribution for each that you would like to receive. The more you give, the closer to our goal we get.*** Detailed information about the various perks ***is provided in the ""What You Get"" section (below).Note: we
 will file the Articles of Incorporation and develop the Federal Application as 
soon as we have reached the $1000 mark on this fundraiser. As soon as the Articles of 
Incorporation are filed, it is possible that additional 
donations from that point forward will be tax deductible. However, at 
this time, your donations are not tax deductible
 and there is no guarantee the IRS will either accept the application in
 the end or backdate eligibility for tax deductions. We will make the 
submission to the IRS when we reach the $2000 mark on the campaign 
(presuming the Federal Application is ready). If, and only if, 
the IRS accepts the application and backdates it to the date of 
incorporation (which is typical) will donations made after the date of incorporation be deductible. Donations made before the date of incorporation are not, and will not be, tax deductible. Please talk to your financial advisor if you have tax questions about this.Stretch Goal100% of any proceeds we raise above and beyond the budgeted goal will be turned over to the foundation and applied toward our principal goal of purchasing between 450 and 2000 acres of Costa Rican primary rain forest for conservation, research, education and exploration. We will be seeking to raise up to $3 million toward that goal in the end.We have one property in particular and several others in the area targeted for conservation. It is our goal to buy as much of it as we can budget and transfer the land which has not yet been degraded to the Piedras Blancas National Park in Costa Rica for conservation. There is a short video in the ""Impact"" section (below) that talks about why this kind of conservation of primary rain forest is important. Please... watch it and share it.Approximately 90 acres of the land situated between the unspoiled primary rain forest and the Golfo Dulce, already degraded as old cocoa and banana plantation and accessible only by boat, will be kept to develop a sustainable, off-grid, eco-lodge in order to support access to the western extent of the Piedras Blancas National Park with facilities for research, study, education and exploration as well as support for an eco-friendly travel destination. We have already retained [SPG] Architects, an architectural firm with a true understanding of sustainable design and development, to help us plan the lodge and develop the design and budget. You can see the initial concept drawings they provided us here (downloadable PDF).The ImpactYour contribution and support can help us do great things for generations to come. Through your support of eco-geeks.org, and The Brechin Heritage Foundation,
 you can make a tangible difference in the future by preserving dwindling 
wilderness spaces, supporting the scientific understanding of the ecosystems 
they contain, fostering hands on education about these places and furthering public awareness as to their intrinsic value and beauty.The Brechin Heritage Foundation is not about knee jerk environmentalism, cynical green 'initiatives' cloaking ulterior motives, or global warming alarm-ism, and certainly is not anti-capitalism. We are not political and have no dogs in the endless infighting between entrenched camps across the spectrum of activism. We are not here to rattle cages, make noise or disrupt lives. We are here to quietly achieve positive results.We are about three very simple things: intelligent and responsible conservation of limited resources, research and education, and public awareness. We have no desire to lock up great expanses of nature and throw away the key. There's little value in that. Rather, we seek to protect eco-systems that are at risk and then support the study and understanding of those eco-systems. But, more than that, we want to make them accessible to the public and to promote appreciation and understanding of their richness, beauty and diversity.It does no good to take a thing you hold precious, hide it in a box and throw away the key. What is the point of having it? In due time it will be forgotten, its value unrecognized and, eventually, it will be lost, stolen or simply rot away. Who but the keeper remembers, or cares, that this special thing was tucked away? Who, besides the key bearer comprehends either its beauty or its intrinsic value? What becomes of it when the protector moves on? To be appreciated and valued, things must be observable, accessible and attainable or they will inevitably fade away into neglect and abandon.With that in mind, at present and as already described in the ""Stretch Goal"" section (above), we are working on our first task: to conserve between 450 and 2000 acres of precious primary rain forest in Costa Rica. A short video about what makes a piece of the rain forest ""primary"" versus ""secondary"" and why it is important to conserve primary rain forest can be seen here:This is not about preventing the native Costa Ricans from using the land. They can. It is about protecting the land against future commercial development while making it accessible for scientific study as well as creating a destination where anyone who cares can experience it first hand. There is very little primary rain forest left in the world and we have little to no understanding of the biodiversity it contains. So, these are the goals of the Brechin Heritage Foundation that you can help us achieve with your contributions and your support:
to identify at-risk eco-systems that can be responsibly and intelligently conserved
to support scientific inquiry of, and education in, those eco-systems
to make those eco-systems accessible to the public in a sustainable way
How You Can Help
Please, make a contribution... even just $1 makes a difference. NO contribution is too small or too large. Every single dollar makes a positive difference and moves us one step closer to realizing the dream.

Whether you can give or not, please help us spread the word... share this campaign on your social networks, tell your friends and family, professors, study groups, researchers, blogs, environmental groups, media and so on. The more people you tell, the more exposure we gain and the better our chances of success.

Please, follow us on Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Share our posts, links and stories and help us make this a reality! Social networking and awareness is at the heart of our success. Keep up with our progress and share our story.

We are going to have need of lawyers, accountants, and professionals as we go forward. If you have skills and you're willing to volunteer time and advice to us, please contact us directly. The more volunteer help we can acquire, the more good we can do. It is our goal to try and keep overhead as close to zero as we possibly can and professional services are our biggest overhead expense.

We need perks! In the larger scheme, we are seeking to crowd fund the purchase of 450 to 2000 acres of primary rain forest for conservation in our first project. We need incentives to encourage people to give. If you have valuables, arts, crafts, services or goods you would be willing to donate (or offer at a respectable discount) for fund raising, please contact us directly. We can do this once the 501(c)(3) has been established so your donation is tax deductible.

Why the ""Brechin"" Heritage Foundation? The answer to that question is history.
This family is directly descended from John Smith of Brechin, Scotland. Two of his sons, John and Peter Smith, emigrated to the United States in the early 1800s, leaving Scotland as dirt poor laborers and arriving in Boston (eventually settling in Andover, Massachusetts) with little more than their dreams and a willingness to work hard. The brothers created their own success and, then, gave it back in spades. They established a standard of giving and support of learning that endures to this day.
The Brechin Heritage Foundation name is a tip of the hat to the high standard they set through their love of the land, their humble beginnings, their honor, their hard work, their success and their willingness to give of themselves to help others, to conserve, to understand and to support education as a means to offer a better tomorrow for others, boys and girls alike, who would otherwise have never had the opportunity.
Why Heritage?
Our family has deep roots in the history of this country aside from our ties to Brechin outlined above. We have been connected to the history of America from the Mayflower to the present. We have served in the military in every war from the American Revolution through the Civil War, both World Wars, and right down the line from Korea and Vietnam to today's War on Terror. From forgotten and penniless farmers and blacksmiths to storied Generals and leaders, we have lived and breathed the greater ideals of the Founding Fathers.
Love of country, the American dream, intellectual curiosity, charity, freedom and sacrifice mean something to every one of us. In our broader family, today, we have active duty and retired combat veterans, law enforcement, EMTs, registered nurses, volunteers, scientists, researchers, engineers, librarians, publishers, educators and artists. We are a hard working, grounded, inquisitive, creative, caring and giving people.
Compassion and service are in our genes as is ambition, a hunger for learning, and a drive to get things done. We have been born to serve, to protect and are motivated to leave the world a better place than we found it; as we have for generations. It is our intent to continue this long family tradition of service and giving through The Brechin Heritage Foundation. We see this as an opportunity to do great things, make a positive difference while continuing an enduring legacy of smart conservation, scientific curiosity and education.
Genealogy: If you'd like to learn more about our family heritage, by all means Google for Peter D Smith of Andover, Massachussettes. We are also directly descended from Brigadier General Marlborough Churchill with distant relationships to Winston Churchill and General George B McClellan. You will find our family tied to Scientific American Magazine via Gerard and Jon Piel and a great deal more for those curious enough to explore our history. It's a fascinating and storied family tree for those who are intrigued by such things.With thanks to those who have gotten us this far...Our very first donor: Dämløk (Horde)Dandrenar (Alliance)Nasland: In honor and love of Temperance (Alliance)Lemirence (Alliance)To my sons, Patrick and Connor (Horde)Joshua Gelaude (Neutral)Nythyl, Night Elf Hunter, Antonidas (Alliance)Colby Beaver (Alliance)Tina Christian (Neutral)Patrick (Alliance)Baskal (Alliance)Kyo and Ithadwyn (Neutral)In memory of Pat Sharp, Singing with the Angels (Alliance)Gregory Huff (Alliance)Clint Yarborough (Neutral)Dan Holsen (Horde)Opuz (Alliance)Gina Clarke (Horde)The Mahans (Alliance)Lolo G-ma (Neutral)Ånhur of Signal Seven (Neutral)Galthis of Zangarmarsh and Feradrys of Earthen Ring (Neutral)Tom Schwarze (Horde)In memory of Anne Bullock (Neutral)in memory of Cowsgomoo (Horde)Stephanie Criddle (Neutral)Andy T (Horde)Steve Thornton (Alliance)Murray, Marion and Christine Smith (Horde)Jerod M.
