<h3>NEW THIS YEAR: A COMPANION BOOK</h3>
<p>Think of the Quilter's Planner as your command central for your desk, and the new QP Mini as its trusty side-kick.  They are designed to by used together, to bring maximum organization and peace to your life.</p>
<p>For those of you who like to carry your planner with you wherever you go (hello, that's me!), I've got good news for you.  This year, you can order our QP Mini  in a bundle along with the Quilter's Planner.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The QP Mini is a  small, 5"" x 7"" book that fits nicely in your bag, and has plenty of room to write your to-do lists, appointments, sketches on graph paper, and project ideas on planning pages.  As the year goes on, you'll be able to visit the QuiltersPlanner.com website to order replacements.</span></p>
<p>I have been experimenting with the QP Mini this year.  I carry it with me everywhere, and jot down things as they come up.  Then, each morning, I wake up, and sit with a cup of coffee and review the things from my Mini that need to be transferred to my Quilter's Planner to ensure that I know the most important things for my day.</p>
<p>Just because you've got 50 responsibilities to handle that day, with the QP Mini you won't ever forget where you have to be or what you're supposed to be doing when you get there.  What a huge relief!</p>

Just tell us at check out where and to whom you want it to be shipped! Gift purchases will include a note so the lucky recipient knows it’s from you. Or you can email me at latenightquilter@gmail.com.</p>
<p><b>Is the Quilter’s Planner available outside of the United States?</b></p>
<p>Yes. I<span style=""background-color: initial;"">nternational shipping can be an uncertain enterprise (as we all know from attempting to ship fabric and swap items to our friends overseas!).  I have worked to get the best rates for and will provide tracking for international shipments. The rates reflect the actual cost for postage and materials - NO PROFIT is derived from shipping fees. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Last year, I was very green and undercharged for international shipping, which resulted in a significant financial loss on those orders. I cannot afford to make that mistake this year and thus overseas shipping rates are slightly higher than last year.</span></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Do you offer bulk discounts or wholesale purchases?</b></p>
<p>Yes!  You can check out the Perks section to see the retail bundle discounts I offer. Please contact me with inquiries about wholesale prices at latenightquilter@gmail.com.</p>
<p><b>Do you offer The Quilter’s Planner in different colors?</b></p>
<p>No. The Quilter’s Planner 2016 edition is only available in the classic cover. We may offer a variety of colors in the future!</p>
<p><b>Can I buy The Quilter’s Planner in a retail store?</b></p>
<p>Yes! You can also buy The Quilter's Planner online at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-quilter-s-planner/x/To%20Order,%20click%20here%20to%20visit%20Fat%20Quarter%20Shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fat Quarter Shop</a>, and you may see them at quilt shops across the country later this year.   </p>
<p><b>What is the size of The Quilter’s Planner?</b></p>
<p>The Quilter’s Planner measures approximately 8.5"" x 10"".</p>
<p><b>What is the deal with the Add-On Mini QP Book?</b></p>
<p>This is designed to work in collaboration with the Original Quilter's Planner; not instead of it.  The QP Mini is designed for you to take with you when you're ""on the go"" and has space to write down appointments, to-do lists, graph paper sketches and project planning ideas.  It does not have weekly or monthly calendars in it... that is still the job of The Original Quilter's Planner. I'm offering it here on Indiegogo at a discounted price of $9 as part of a bundle with the Quilter's Planner. Additional copies of the QP Mini will be available for purchase at the standard price from <a href=""http://www.quiltersplanner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.quiltersplanner.com.</a></p>
<p>For US purchasers, there is no additional shipping charge when the QP Mini add-on book is included as part of a bundle with the Quilter's Planner. International shipments incur additional charges based on weight, and I have to charge an additional amount to cover this. </p>
<p>There is NO PROFIT on shipping - just the costs for the fulfillment center and the best rates I was able to negotiate.</p>
<p><b>When will the Quilter’s Planner arrive in my mailbox?</b></p>
<p>We’re starting this IndieGoGo campaign with the goal of delivering the 2017 Quilter’s Planner by early October 2016. If you're giving this is a gift (and it certainly WOULD make a phenomenal gift), rest assured - the lucky recipient should have it in his or her hands for the holidays! There is a small chance we’ll face a printing or shipping delay, however you will have this planner in your hands prior to the beginning of the new year!</p>

 PROJECTS
 
I designed The Quilter's Planner not only to be a place that you track your appointments and responsibilities, but also a place you can plan and organize your projects.
The planner contains graph paper for sketching new quilt designs, and space to doodle and practice your free motion quilting designs. 
This page allows you list all your Works in Progress, so you can see all your quilting projects in one place.  You can track your progress, priorities and deadlines.  This year, there are two pages instead of one.  Need more?  Then make sure you order our newest addition to the line-up this year: The Quilter's Planner Mini. Read more about it below! 
With the Project Planning page, you can keep notes about what materials you need or have, and the steps you need to take to finish. This can also become a mini-scrapbook of the projects you complete through the year.  Just because you give away a quilt as a gift, doesn't mean you should forget the joys and challenges that went into making it.    
And my favorite part of the Project Planning Page? You can even attach fabric swatches at the bottom and a picture or sketch of your project at the top, with sticky dots! PATTERNS

I have been experimenting with the QP Mini this year.  I carry it with me everywhere, and jot down things as they come up.  Then, each morning, I wake up, and sit with a cup of coffee and review the things from my Mini that need to be transferred to my Quilter's Planner to ensure that I know the most important things for my day.
Just because you've got 50 responsibilities to handle that day, with the QP Mini you won't ever forget where you have to be or what you're supposed to be doing when you get there.  What a huge relief!
 





Look at the big picture and know what's coming. The monthly calendars allow you to get a bird's eye view of your year and months so you can plan ahead and stay organized.

Manage your time. A daily appointment calendar allows you to easily keep track of where you need to be, and how you spend your time.

Create a keepsake of your quilting and personal life. By tracking your projects and life, you are keeping a journal, a snap-shot of your life.  You can look back in years to come and see how you've grown and all you've achieved. 

Be inspired. Inspirational quotes and beautiful artwork keep you motivated and encourage creativity.

This planner set is designed to be tailored to your life.  Whether you're balancing work and your creative life, or setting new goals as a quilter, this planner gives you flexibility to use it in the way that serves you best.

Follow your bliss. Manage your time and set realistic goals so you can do more of what you love!

Get focused. Weekly and daily layouts, and room to prioritize your daily top three tasks that need to get done allow you to focus your attention on the most important things in your life. 

The Quilter’s Planner is made in the USA.
The self-publishing costs for a printed planner are substantial.  By pre-ordering your planners here on Indiegogo, you'll make sure that you reserve a Quilter's Planner before they sell out, and you're helping me determine just how many to order from the printer this year.  
 

Thank you so much for the love and support you've shown me for the planner this past year, and for helping me make it even better than ever. Please help me get the word out to quilters everywhere about this amazing tool.  Once you log in to Indiegogo, you can quickly and easily share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using the share tools on the sidebars.   
 Can I have it shipped to a different address from my billing address or send it to someone as a gift?Yes! Just tell us at check out where and to whom you want it to be shipped! Gift purchases will include a note so the lucky recipient knows it’s from you. Or you can email me at latenightquilter@gmail.com.
Is the Quilter’s Planner available outside of the United States?
Yes. International shipping can be an uncertain enterprise (as we all know from attempting to ship fabric and swap items to our friends overseas!).  I have worked to get the best rates for and will provide tracking for international shipments. The rates reflect the actual cost for postage and materials - NO PROFIT is derived from shipping fees. 
Last year, I was very green and undercharged for international shipping, which resulted in a significant financial loss on those orders. I cannot afford to make that mistake this year and thus overseas shipping rates are slightly higher than last year.
Do you offer bulk discounts or wholesale purchases?
Yes!  You can check out the Perks section to see the retail bundle discounts I offer. Please contact me with inquiries about wholesale prices at latenightquilter@gmail.com.
Do you offer The Quilter’s Planner in different colors?
No. The Quilter’s Planner 2016 edition is only available in the classic cover. We may offer a variety of colors in the future!
Can I buy The Quilter’s Planner in a retail store?
Yes! You can also buy The Quilter's Planner online at Fat Quarter Shop, and you may see them at quilt shops across the country later this year.   
What is the size of The Quilter’s Planner?
The Quilter’s Planner measures approximately 8.5"" x 10"".
What is the deal with the Add-On Mini QP Book?
This is designed to work in collaboration with the Original Quilter's Planner; not instead of it.  The QP Mini is designed for you to take with you when you're ""on the go"" and has space to write down appointments, to-do lists, graph paper sketches and project planning ideas.  It does not have weekly or monthly calendars in it... that is still the job of The Original Quilter's Planner. I'm offering it here on Indiegogo at a discounted price of $9 as part of a bundle with the Quilter's Planner. Additional copies of the QP Mini will be available for purchase at the standard price from www.quiltersplanner.com.
For US purchasers, there is no additional shipping charge when the QP Mini add-on book is included as part of a bundle with the Quilter's Planner. International shipments incur additional charges based on weight, and I have to charge an additional amount to cover this. 
There is NO PROFIT on shipping - just the costs for the fulfillment center and the best rates I was able to negotiate.
When will the Quilter’s Planner arrive in my mailbox?
We’re starting this IndieGoGo campaign with the goal of delivering the 2017 Quilter’s Planner by early October 2016. If you're giving this is a gift (and it certainly WOULD make a phenomenal gift), rest assured - the lucky recipient should have it in his or her hands for the holidays! There is a small chance we’ll face a printing or shipping delay, however you will have this planner in your hands prior to the beginning of the new year!
 
Designing, printing, and shipping a planner has many moving parts. I have a great team that is very experienced in the details of creating and delivering a high quality planner; they are dedicated to making this project a success.Though we've planned this meticulously, there is a small (less than 5%) chance the Quilter’s Planner could arrive in mailboxes in mid October instead of early October.

<p>In order to allow artists to purely concentrate on creating and submitting work which will fit the brief and inspire you, me and all of us in the process, i need your collective help to pay for this project because if everybody puts in a little, we will all get a lot out of this!</p>

<p>I REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS!! </p>
<p><b>THE REWARDS AND THE HELPERS</b></p>
<p>One of the many reasons i am massively excited about this project, is that already so many beautiful people have been helping to get it of the ground. </p>
<p>From Mr Nick Smith, my forever trusted friend  and web-designer who makes all my design dreams come true in exchange for haircuts :)  .</p>
<p>Mr David Hay who is a producer and pulled in favours left right and center to help me make the video! Richard Topping who kindly got involved and did an incredible job filming me after only knowing of me and my quest for the better part of a day..! Ben Hume- Paton who patently and brilliantly did the edit and whom i have yet to meet. James Downham, one of my hairdressing customers whom i roped in last minute to take over the sound part of the video ( free haircuts for you too James ;)) and Teddy Lamb, Lucy Frost and Nika Obydzinsky , the 3 volunteers who i was allowed to physically label in public ;P</p>
<p>Teddy specifically because he helped me getting over my nerves and assisted all day with the filming!!!</p>
<p>Not to mention ( tho i will on my website ) the awesome folks that did the subtitle translations for my script so that more people get the message,...literally!! </p>
<p><b>You see people are amazing!!!!</b></p>
<p>The other surprise on this project is, that some of my artist friends have actually offered to get involved with the rewards ( imagine that..they believe in me and my drive so much that they give their time and work for free &lt;3)</p>
<p>So there is<b> Anne 'Blondie' Bengard</b>, an incredibly talented artist who will blow you away with her water-colour skills!! She not only offered 4 limited edition signed and numbered giclee prints of her popular piece 'Sweet Tooth' ( below)...(all gone now)</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446383687/n8yv7x7odhvwfmmeqert.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>but if that wasn't enough, she added custom A2 watercolour portraits for £450 each.You provide a photo of yourself or anyone you want painted, from the bust up, and Anne will create an original art work in her unmistakable style!!! AAAAAND she added:<p> 'Who's Your Master?' limited edition A3 giclee print.at £60 </p>
<p>This print which is limited to 50 has not even been released yet and this is your chance to snap one up before it becomes available to everyone else, at a price that's lower than it will be once they go on sale! They are now added to the rewards section on the page, so if it's gone, it's gone! </p>

<p><b> Glenn Fitzy Fitzpatrick 's </b>pencil skills and never ending creativity blow me away on a regular basis, so needless to say that i am massively grateful that he picked up his pencil weapon and drew not 1 but 3 A5 panels for STOPJECTIFY of which each comes at a price of £100 and the limited and signed prints will be also part of the pack! </p>

<br/>And of course this wouldn't be my project if i didn't create something for it myself.

</div></div>","A crowd-funding campaign, raising money to organise and put on, an extraordinary  inspiring central London based group exhibition, exploring the damaging effects of objectification through art,- imagining an alternative more compassionate reality for all.Wonderful people of the crowd-funding sphere, my name is Jess, i am London based Berliner Artist, Feminist and after this i guess you can call me curator too.
( you can always call me a badass ninja tho!!)
I talk regularly with people about topics such as Feminism, gender inequalities, sexism and the constant objectification many of us face day in and day out.
After yet another defeatist comment like ' Nothing you can do about it' and 'i see your point, but we all know that's not going to change in your life-time' i figured, like Michael Jackson already sung ...... 


If you wanna make the world a better place
TAKE A LOOK AT YOURSELF AND MAKE A CHANGE! And then STOPJECTIFY was born.... So here i go, MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN. 
But being an artist and having run a successful crowd-funding campaign for my last solo show #bigswingingovaries once before, i know that without YOU and YOUR HELP, it's pretty difficult, if not impossible.
Change can happen, and it can happen quick. And anybody that tries to convince you otherwise is generally just to afraid to dream big.....not me. 
STOPJECTIFY is going to be a central London based group exhibition. 
This is something much bigger than myself, that i feel will leave much greater impact if many creative thinkers and visionaries  get together and produce an artistic expression of just how damaging objectification and the often directly related self-hate is.
Some sort of benchmark for all of us, to stop the unsolicited judgement of others and ourself,constantly happening in our head without any challenge,
- and turn it into an internal conversation each time it occurs, because realisation is the first step to actually create change. 
The other and hopefully even bigger part of the show, will be art which dares to imagine an alternative reality. One where we are much more conscious about what we say and do to each other and the impact that it has. 
To get people involved from all over the globe ( because this is something we ALL have to deal with) i want the submission process to be as accessible as possible. 
What many of you are not aware of, but all of my artistic fellows know far to well, is that to get our work in front of an audience, we already have to pay frequently and not small amounts of money either, which often doesn't even guarantee that the work will be exhibited, which leaves us artists with a tricky loop to overcome.
To sell art you need to establish yourself, to establish yourself, you need to get your work seen as much as possible, to do that you need money, to make money you have to sell art, or get another job to support your art-making, which sadly often means that artists haven't got enough time to actually make art....
you see what i am getting at. 
SO to fund this show, I NEED YOUR HELP!
This is also the point in the campaign where i am asking YOU to submit work! 

If you are an artist and you want to submit your work  resonating with the project and points below, please head over to www.bigswingingovaries.com/stopjectify   
and fill out the submission form. To me it is irrelevant when the work was produced as i believe that a lot of art is made before it's time and don't want to limit this exhibition by silly time-restrictions.
What i am looking for in this exhibition is art that :



 • defines objectification as one of our universal root problems
• Addresses gender inequalities and social taboos
with regards to objectification
• Explores the difference between consensual roleplay
and everyday misogyny and objectification





• Imagines an alternative, more compassionate
reality where people are more conscious of their
behaviours towards others


Objectification isn't exclusively a gender Problem, it is THE problem, or more to the point- the cause of most of the problems we have in the world today.
The hate and violence against refugees and migrants is also the result of objectifying people.
If we had more empathy and  ""humanisation"" towards people from other cultures and countries, we wouldn't have a refugee crisis. In other words, we wouldn't have refugees, because there wouldn't be poverty, misery and war in the world. ( the last part is a direct quote from my brother and had to be added due to it's poignance!)


Please do understand that of course not all art submitted can be accepted, as i am expecting a high attendance and above all the show needs to work as a whole message. 
So if your work doesn't get selected, PLEASE don't take that as a comment on your artistic ability, our friendship or let it stop you from submitting works in the future. It might just mean that somebody submitted work similar to yours already or that in the big picture it just didn't fit with this particular show. ( i know everybody is sensitive about their art ;) 
I have secured the ground-floor space of  central London Gallery, which means the exhibition will be easily accessible ( because trust me, accessibility is a major factor for people to go and see art), it also means that it's not cheap...

Other costs will be for setting up,taking down and marketing of the exhibit, as well as for the general assistance i will need to pull this off! 
The gallery has a downstairs too, which i want to hire as well, but to not lay all the financial burden on you, i  will also submit an application to the arts council to match-fund my,... our project, as soon as the campaign is up and running because,
I REALLY BELIEVE IN THIS!! 
THE REWARDS AND THE HELPERS
One of the many reasons i am massively excited about this project, is that already so many beautiful people have been helping to get it of the ground. 
From Mr Nick Smith, my forever trusted friend  and web-designer who makes all my design dreams come true in exchange for haircuts :)  .
Mr David Hay who is a producer and pulled in favours left right and center to help me make the video! Richard Topping who kindly got involved and did an incredible job filming me after only knowing of me and my quest for the better part of a day..! Ben Hume- Paton who patently and brilliantly did the edit and whom i have yet to meet. James Downham, one of my hairdressing customers whom i roped in last minute to take over the sound part of the video ( free haircuts for you too James ;)) and Teddy Lamb, Lucy Frost and Nika Obydzinsky , the 3 volunteers who i was allowed to physically label in public ;P
Teddy specifically because he helped me getting over my nerves and assisted all day with the filming!!!
Not to mention ( tho i will on my website ) the awesome folks that did the subtitle translations for my script so that more people get the message,...literally!! 
You see people are amazing!!!!
The other surprise on this project is, that some of my artist friends have actually offered to get involved with the rewards ( imagine that..they believe in me and my drive so much that they give their time and work for free <3)
So there is Anne 'Blondie' Bengard, an incredibly talented artist who will blow you away with her water-colour skills!! She not only offered 4 limited edition signed and numbered giclee prints of her popular piece 'Sweet Tooth' ( below)...(all gone now)

but if that wasn't enough, she added custom A2 watercolour portraits for £450 each.You provide a photo of yourself or anyone you want painted, from the bust up, and Anne will create an original art work in her unmistakable style!!! AAAAAND she added: 'Who's Your Master?' limited edition A3 giclee print.at £60 
This print which is limited to 50 has not even been released yet and this is your chance to snap one up before it becomes available to everyone else, at a price that's lower than it will be once they go on sale! They are now added to the rewards section on the page, so if it's gone, it's gone! 



Next up is the wonderful HarlotteVonCharlotte. Another incredible artist friend of mine who produced the A5 piece below, of which the original will be available as well as signed and numbered geclee prints that come as part of the Stopjectify pack that includes several prints of contributing artists!


 

 Glenn Fitzy Fitzpatrick 's pencil skills and never ending creativity blow me away on a regular basis, so needless to say that i am massively grateful that he picked up his pencil weapon and drew not 1 but 3 A5 panels for STOPJECTIFY of which each comes at a price of £100 and the limited and signed prints will be also part of the pack! 

Another wonderful artist and contributor to the rewards is my good friend Jane Moore. She is supporting my campaign by giving me some of her original drawings from her own 'sketch a day project' as well as one print! .




Mr Hugo von Hugo also kindly gave another generous donation to the ‪#‎STOPJECTIFY‬ cause!'Art Needs You' 60 x 80 cm (A1)£90 unframedLimited edition Single colour silk Screen Print (Edition 25). Printed on 300gsm art paper.Numbered and signed.


And of course this wouldn't be my project if i didn't create something for it myself. So below is my embroidery ""understand that you are so much more than just parts"" , of which prints will also be available in the pack as well as a limited number of A4 art prints aaaand the embroideries below too!!
 





As you can see in the reward section on the right, 

 i will also be stitching a limited number of custom embroidery portraits of you that will be mounted on n A4 board for £350 each. That is special as i have otherwise decided to not do custom work anymore as it just takes to much time away from my quest to change the world. So if custom is what you are after, here is your pop! 
The other custom options created by me and at a greater cost due to obvious reasons, are my custom Retex Portraits at an A2 size for £1500 like the ones you see below 




Other ( and less costly) rewards include STOPJECTIFY t-sirts, tote bags, Sticker-packs, A4 art prints , Patches, Badges  AND 'Cats against Cat calling' T-shirts ;)





Furthermore, my bestie Anja Moehler , who is responsible for crafting the awesome Big swinging Ovaries necklaces and bracelets, has kindly given 2 of them for the campaign, one of which has already been snapped up ;) 



And then of course there is always the option of just donating money and saving me from the taxman ;) 

So all in all you see that i will make this happen no matter what! 
It would just be so much more powerful if you would be a part of it!!

Lots of Love and thanks for taking the time to read!!
Forever yours

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>Je m'appelle Joad, j'ai 22ans et je suis étudiant au Centre National des Arts du Cirque à Châlons-en-Champagne. Je travaille au mât chinois depuis presque 5ans. C'est grâce au mât que je peux vous raconter des histoires et vous laisser plonger dans mon univers, et c'est pour pouvoir vous proposer de voyager avec mon mât et moi que j'ai besoin de votre soutient.</p>
<p>Pour le moment je travaille avec un matériel qui n'est pas le mien mais qui appartient à l'école, sans quoi il me serait bien difficile d'avancer. Mais d'ici peu mon cursus va prendre fin et je vais rapidement avoir besoin de mon propre matériel pour faire mon chemin dans le monde du spectacle vivant.</p>
<p>Alors voilà, c'est un mât de 6m de haut, du revêtement en néoprène, des mètres de câbles en acier, des mètres de sangle, des maillons rapides, des cliquets, des manilles, des deltas... En bref de quoi le faire tenir suffisamment bien, parce que si ça ne tient pas moi non plus je ne tiens pas.<br/><br/>De ce fait, aujourd'hui j'en ai pour 850€ pour le mât et 150€ pour les accroches.<br/>Je me permet donc de faire appel à votre générosité pour soutenir de nouveaux artistes comme moi qui essaient de vous faire rêver et de vous partager leurs idées à travers de nombreuses formes.</p>
<p>Merci du fond du cœur et n'hésitez pas à parler de ce projet autour de vous !</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>I'm Joad, Im 22 and I'm a student at the National Circus Art Center in France. I practice chinese pole for almost 5 years. With my chinese pole, I can tell you stories and make you dive into my universe, and it's to be able to travel with me that I need your help.</p>
<p>I'm currently working with some material that is not mine but the one of the school, and without this it will be hard to work. In few months I'll finish my last year in school and I'll quickly need to have my own material to act out there.</p>
<p>So it's a 6m pole with neoprene, meters of cable, meters of strap, quick links, ratchets, deltas... Let's say that it has to hold in place, because if not, I'll fall with.</p>
<p>The pole costs 850€ and the fittings cost 150€. So I ask for your generosity to help new circus artists like me who trie to make you dream and share their ideas acting.</p>
<p>A huge thanks and don't hesitate to share this project !</p>

The ImpactThe plan is to build at the Mission Road Warehouse in San Antonio where community will be created through art despite any obstacles. Through collaboration, creativity, and instruction people will have the opportunity to learn new metal working skills and techniques while forging new friendships and alliances.At Apogaea attendees will have several opportunities to interact with Trinity del Fuego:1) There is the open invitation for everyone to experience the excitement and the heat of forging metal with the fires of Medusa.2) There is the button pushing invitation to make large bursts of flame gush out of both Hekate's and Inanna's heads.3) There is the central dish containing the eternal flame (with a surrounding wood fire) in which participants can cast their written dreams or wishes into.4) And then there's just the pure pleasure of stopping and enjoying the warmth of an open fire on a chilly night as one makes one's way about the event.What We NeedEach structure
will need fresh steel to create their understructures; sheet metal, scrap
metal, and found objects to create their outer skins. All will need pyro-technic components. We need approximately $7500 to build each of the three individual sculptures, andan additional $750 to create the central hearth. That's approximately $21,500 Total to create and transport this project to Apogaea in Colorado June 4-9, 2014.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Art For Life is a community of single parents who are trying to better their lives through art, and artists who are bring the art world to the lives of the less fortunate. We've found that bringing art to the lives of those in need allows those who participate to dream, hope, express, and create. It is imperative to their well-being to be able to reflect on their life-aspirations, rather than dwell on their life-obstacles. Often times the art is donated to other organizations to help fund their causes as well. Please help us raise funds to help those in need - progress in life, and have faith in themselves and in the humanity of others.</p>
<p>My name is Sonny Luca. I am a single father of three children. After many years of life-obstacles, trials, and tribulations - I have returned to art. I had never forgotten about my love for art, and the way it affects people. Even through losing a spouse, being an instant single-father, and being homeless - I have remembered the joy that art always brought to my family, my community, and myself. I have been extremely lucky, and grateful, to have had the opportunity to bring art to others in situations <span>similar</span> to mine.</p>
<p>I have found that bringing art to the lives of those in need allows those who participate to dream, hope, express, and create. It is imperative to their well-being to be able to reflect on their life-aspirations, rather than dwell on their life-obstacles. Often times the art is donated to other organizations to help fund their causes as well. This, in turn, brings a sense of community, service, and self-worth to the artists.</p>
<p>Please help us raise funds to help those in need - progress in life, and have faith in themselves and in the humanity of others.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>The some of the funds will go to help pay for resources - not only for the art. We will be purchasing the supplies for art projects, and we will be helping the artists with their life needs as we can; i.e. help with housing, food, toiletries, clothing, et cetera.</p>
<p>Contributors will be recognized with the following rewards:</p>
<ol>
<li>For contributions of $50 - set of 4 postcards with limited edition prints of original artwork. </li>
<li>For contributions of $100 - set of 4 postcards with prints of original artwork; and one (1) 8 x 10 limited edition print of original artwork.</li>

<li>For contributions of $500 - set of 4 postcards with limited edition prints of original artwork; one (1) exclusive original 8x10 custom artwork. </li>
<li>For contributions of $1000 or more - set of 4 postcards with limited edition prints of original artwork; one (1) exclusive original 11x14 custom artwork. </li>
</ol>
<p>NEW!!! Most Referral Award - The visitor with the most referrals will be awarded one (1) 8 x 10 limited edition print of original artwork.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being a single parent is a hard reality for both the child (who is usually confused and full of questions) and the parent (who is usually in the same <span>devastating</span> confusion with the added stress of the responsibility of another life as well).

</div></div>","Short Summary
Art For Life is a community of single parents who are trying to better their lives through art, and artists who are bring the art world to the lives of the less fortunate. We've found that bringing art to the lives of those in need allows those who participate to dream, hope, express, and create. It is imperative to their well-being to be able to reflect on their life-aspirations, rather than dwell on their life-obstacles. Often times the art is donated to other organizations to help fund their causes as well. Please help us raise funds to help those in need - progress in life, and have faith in themselves and in the humanity of others.
My name is Sonny Luca. I am a single father of three children. After many years of life-obstacles, trials, and tribulations - I have returned to art. I had never forgotten about my love for art, and the way it affects people. Even through losing a spouse, being an instant single-father, and being homeless - I have remembered the joy that art always brought to my family, my community, and myself. I have been extremely lucky, and grateful, to have had the opportunity to bring art to others in situations similar to mine.
I have found that bringing art to the lives of those in need allows those who participate to dream, hope, express, and create. It is imperative to their well-being to be able to reflect on their life-aspirations, rather than dwell on their life-obstacles. Often times the art is donated to other organizations to help fund their causes as well. This, in turn, brings a sense of community, service, and self-worth to the artists.
Please help us raise funds to help those in need - progress in life, and have faith in themselves and in the humanity of others.

The Impact
Being a single parent is a hard reality for both the child (who is usually confused and full of questions) and the parent (who is usually in the same devastating confusion with the added stress of the responsibility of another life as well). The impact of being homeless and losing your world and resources as well makes it unbearable. When you are a single parent who works multiple jobs to try to make ends meet and the state resources deny you aid for being the good guy and maintaining work... well, where do you turn to then? 
Our community of artists believe that with just a little assistance; hope can inspire and motivate good people to accomplish greatness. I have seen this very principle work before.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my loves. My name is Sarah Myles Spencer. I know I'm supposed to be brief here, but I don't know how I can sum all of this up in just a few words. Please bare with me!</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know me, I'm a singing, writing, poeming, hard loving, mama from California who recently moved to Norman, Oklahoma. The move was the culmination of a long and challenging past couple of years. I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I was his primary caretaker, and he eventually passed away. After his passing, my husband and I were in severe debt from all the medical bills and long term care. We were unexpectedly forced to move with our children, from our home and later that year we became homeless. It was a devastating time for us, but thanks to community and grace and love and our own courageous spirits, we are still here and thriving.</p>
<p>After my father died, I made a vow that I was going to come out of my shell and do things I hadn't yet had the courage to do; things that I had allowed my my own fears and insecurities to get in the way of. I had been a writer and performer for a long time, but in the face of tragedy, my art had become stagnent. So, one of the things I did was road-tripping hundreds of miles with two friends last year, to volunteer at The Women of the World National Poetry Slam (WoWps).</p>
<p>WoWps is one of three National Poetry Slam events headed by Poetry Slam Incorporated (PSI). Each year, it takes place in a different city and state, and hundreds of women come together from all over to share their poems and their hearts at this four day festival. Roughly 80 women compete every year.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the experience of volunteering very much, but my heart longed for the experience of sharing in this community as an artist. Well, it's amazing what you can manifest without even realizing it, and this year in March, I have the privilege and the opportunity to represent my venue, Red Dirt Poetry, at WoWps.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p>This year, WoWps is being held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. My venue covers the cost of my registration for the competition, but I must cover the cost of travel, room, and meals. I don't drive due to health reasons, which means I must either fly or carpool with another person. This is my first national event and a huge step outside of my comfort zone, and I need community to help me make it happen. I humbly ask you, to join me, in this chapter of my journey to step into my personal truth, to live with my heart open, and free.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I spent a lot of time on this part! In fact, I agnoized over it a great deal. Asking for help can be hard sometimes, especially with so little time, and I really wanted to give something special back in return. Now it's finally put together, so here's the deal: </p>
<p>-The cost of a hotel room for the four days I need to be there is $540 including tax</p>
<p>-The cost of parking is $65</p>
<p>-The cost of gas will be roughly $300</p>
<p>Other expenses I haven't added up yet include:</p>
<p>-Meals for four days plus during travel</p>
<p>-emergency funds</p>
<p>-funds for printing and mailing merch</p>
<p>As you can see, this totals over the amount I am aiming for. My plan is to split costs with other participants, but in a worse case scenario, I will have to cover all of this myself. In the worst of worse case scenarios, I would have to get a plane ticket last minute, which would put me well over a thousand dollars. I don't foresee that happening. I'm feeling pretty optimistic despite my nerves! On the flipside, if I am driving with a companion who is splitting costs with me, this hopefully gives me room to cover any car maintenance issues or anything else that might arise. It also enables me to use funds for printing and mailing merchandise.</p>
<p>Like I said, I know I may be low balling it, but I would rather ask for a solid minimum amount, than to ask for too much. I would be so grateful to meet my minimum goal; I would be over the moon if I some how raised more. That being said, if I do happen to have have any excess above the cost of travel, hotel, and parking, it will go towards any of the above mentioned remaining expenses like meals, vehicle care, printing, shipping, etc. In the event that there is a large excess, this money will be put into holding and will go towards my next book/album. And I will communicate those details wholly, if for some amazing reason that occurs. In contrast, if for some reason I don't reach my goal, the money will still go towards these things. I will simply have to find a way to get it done. I want to be as transparent here as possible. If we hit any bumps in the road or if I don't make enough for some reason or have any sort of emergency that I am having trouble working through, I will be here, communicating about it. I DO NOT FORESEE ANY OF THAT. But I know it's important for everyone donating to know what would happen if, if, if. I believe my needs will be met though. I believe I will be taken care of. I believe in this; in community.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered that, I am offering some really fun incentives to those who donate that I am feeling super excited about. I am glad to be able to offer you something awesome in return; a real part of me, my art, and craft, and some from those who are close to me.</p>
<p>Some things that are on the table: There is plenty of merchandise - some new and even some unreleased. There are poem commissions, singing voicemails, videos, and personalized songs. There are even personal portraits, beauty products, tarot readings, and nutritional consultations from some incredibly talented friends of mine. And above everything, there is gratitude; SO MUCH GRATITUDE. Anyone who donates is acknowledged, no matter how big or small your contribution. Because IT ALL MAKES A DIFFERENCE. It really does.</p>
<p>Note: Estimated delivery date for items is set for April and May. While more detailed packages may need this extension, I expect chapbooks, e-downloads, and notes to be delivered anytime between the end of March and middle of April. As for the unrecorded and unreleased items, poem comissions, and portraits, I will personally correspond with those donors and recipients of those items to work out personalized delivery dates as is agreed upon by both parties and in a timely manner.</p>
<p>ALSO: You can donate ANY AMOUNT - the amounts I have listed are directely related to the perks. You can donate any other amount you would like and I will personally thank you! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all have one life to do with as much as we possibly can. But really, what we have is today. And every day I wake up, whether it's a good day or a rough day, I try to make it count in some way. And the best way I know how to do that is to love, and my poems and my voice are one of the many ways in which I love. And I believe that my voice has meaning and value and I deeply desire the experience of co-mingling that voice with so many other significant voices all telling our truths, all coming together, all loving hard. I believe that this is what's in store for me on this adventure.</p>
<p>The difference you make here is enormous to me; inside me, it is something I will take with me forever, and in turn this affects my family, and the people around me. We never know who we will affect in this lifetime. Know, that by contributing here, you are affecting someone in the most wonderful ways.</p>
<p>Words will never be able to express what all of this really means to me, nor the gratitude I have for each one of you that assists in it, but goodness knows I will try.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone can donate money, but that doesn't mean you can't help. EVERYONE CAN HELP. Please, just take a moment and donate your TIME by sharing my campaign - my story - and a little extra love. Indiegogo provides easy sharing tools to do this, so please, share share SHARE away. I am getting this up and running with just enough time to make an impact so anything you can do to spread the word helps me so immensely.</p>
<p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. So much gratitude. So much love. So much.</p>
<p>-Sarah</p>
<p>P.S. ALSO: *Nova Sol Holistic Studios will donate 25% of their sales to me for anybody I refer who purchases additional items for Valentine's Day or dry winter skin through Feb 14th! Just mention me when buying!</p>

<h2>Camp Craft, Coming to an Eastside, Los Angeles Neighborhood Soon!</h2>
<p>Those of you who have known me for many years as a friend, co-worker, or sitter, know that children play a very important role in my life. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to develop a business plan that involves children and provides a valuable service to the community. I believe that there is a need for a do-it-yourself studio for both children and adults to create quality, hand-made crafts. I developed Camp Craft as a creative studio where crafting is readily available during studio hours with a surplus of quality supplies, ample space, and with people like myself who love both children and crafts working there.  </p>
<p>In addition to offering drop-in DIY crafting, Camp Craft will have multiple stations offering age-appropriate options for children and items for adults to create. A few of the craft stations will include: build a terrarium, create a dreamcatcher, make a scented mason jar candle (for adults) or a beeswax candle (for children), and will have a monthly featured craft.</p>
<p>Camp Craft will also play a vital role in the community by offering a space for events and the opportunity to engage in an artful activity to celebrate an occasion. Whether you need a venue for a child's birthday party, a girls' night out, or simply would like to learn to make something new-- Camp Craft will serve as a space for celebration and creativity. </p>
<p>Camp Craft will have four elements:</p>
<p>• Open craft studio hours with specialized craft stations,</p>
<p>• A venue for birthday parties for children on weekend days and special events for adults in the evenings,<br/></p>
<p>• Workshops to expand a crafting skill set,</p>
<p>• Craft subscriptions will be available for those who may not visit the store, or would like to supplement their crafting by receiving Craft Packs by mail. This option may (and should!) be used for gifting.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The Plan</h2>
<p>I have developed the concept and taken Camp Craft through the planning stages and am reaching out to my community to ask for support in raising the start-up funds to allow Camp Craft to become a reality. Contributors will not only help in making the store come to fruition, they will enrich the local community by supporting the establishment of a space that fosters creative development.</p>
<p>Camp Craft will open a brick and mortar store in Spring of 2014 and will host pop-up events in boutiques, farmers markets and crafting fairs leading up to its opening. There will also be an online store offering Craft Packs for sale, coming soon. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p></p>
<p>To make all of this a reality, Camp Craft needs $15,000 in funding to become an independently owned and run business. Start-up costs have been budgeted and include the following:</p>
<p>Legal Costs: 10%<br/>Raw and Marketing Materials: 10%<span><br/></span>Materials: 20%<span><br/></span>Renovation and Set-Up: 20%<span><br/></span>Rental Assistance: 40%</p>
<p>Your support and generosity is essential to raising the funds needed to establish Camp Craft. Thank you for taking the time to learn about Camp Craft and I look forward to creating something with you very soon.<br/></p>

<p><span>A special thanks to those who helped me make the short film.

• Craft subscriptions will be available for those who may not visit the store, or would like to supplement their crafting by receiving Craft Packs by mail. This option may (and should!) be used for gifting.
 
The Plan
I have developed the concept and taken Camp Craft through the planning stages and am reaching out to my community to ask for support in raising the start-up funds to allow Camp Craft to become a reality. Contributors will not only help in making the store come to fruition, they will enrich the local community by supporting the establishment of a space that fosters creative development.
Camp Craft will open a brick and mortar store in Spring of 2014 and will host pop-up events in boutiques, farmers markets and crafting fairs leading up to its opening. There will also be an online store offering Craft Packs for sale, coming soon. 

What We Need

To make all of this a reality, Camp Craft needs $15,000 in funding to become an independently owned and run business. Start-up costs have been budgeted and include the following:
Legal Costs: 10%Raw and Marketing Materials: 10%Materials: 20%Renovation and Set-Up: 20%Rental Assistance: 40%
Your support and generosity is essential to raising the funds needed to establish Camp Craft. Thank you for taking the time to learn about Camp Craft and I look forward to creating something with you very soon.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>My name is David Kachel (<i>cockle</i>) and I have been a fine-art B&amp;W, landscape photographer since 1979, with the exception of one brief period during 1980 when I became a street photographer, against my will. My adventure began with the theft of all my photographic equipment at a bus terminal in Lima, Peru in May of 1980. That eventually led to months of wandering the streets of the city of Arequipa, in southern Peru, with a borrowed, antique 35mm camera (the only camera available, and useless for landscape work), a single, uncoated lens and no light meter. It was either street photography, or no photography at all.</p>
<p>An introvert's introvert, I discovered to my astonishment that I loved that sortie into street photography and found it very productive. But, my joy didn't last long.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I could never have replaced my stolen equipment while in Peru and so, after a time was forced to return to the USA. As it turned out, all the film from those months of work on the streets of Arequipa was badly marred by heat-damaged developer acquired in Peru, leaving hundred of tiny marks on every negative and making them all, utterly unprintable. Worse, two darkroom floods over the years damaged a number of negatives further still. Some were destroyed completely. The project languished in my files, untouched and unprinted, for decades. Until the advent of digital photography, they were all thought to be completely unsalvageable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1016129/files/20141114184806-Geezer_Neg39Sheet106_WEB_MASTER.jpg?1416019686"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Entrando a la Iglésia</i></p>
<br/>
<p>In the mid-1980s I acquired a strong interest in photogravure, but it was always too expensive to take up, especially for my large landscape work. Only in the last couple of years have advances in technology made it financially feasible to pursue that interest. I started acquiring equipment and experimenting with photogravure printmaking in late 2013.</p>
<p>While contemplating which of my photographs might be suitable to print as photogravures, I remembered the street images from Peru and realized in the same instant that they would be ideal as photogravures and that they might also now be repairable. A move from analog to digital photography begun over six years ago, enabled me over the space of a couple months, to scan and repair those Peru street images... some eighty selected negatives. Thirty-six have been singled out from those eighty. None of these images have ever been exhibited, sold, or even seen publicly before now, save a few web postings made in the last few months, mostly on my new blog:</p>

<h3>Project to Include Three Classes of Print</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carbon &amp; Color Pigment on Stonehenge Natural printmaking paper</li>
<li>Polymer Plate Photogravure on Revere Silk-Ivory printmaking paper</li>
<li>Polymer Plate Photogravure on Japanese tissue, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped-in_page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tipped-in</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chine-coll%C3%A9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chine collé</a>,<span><br/></span>to one of the above mentioned papers</li>
</ul>
<div>Nota Bene: Perk prints are delivered un-matted. I spent a long time determining that the ideal matting material for these prints is <i>Rising Natural</i> 4-ply museum board (sometimes called <i>Kensington</i>) and suggest you ask your framer for the same. If you prefer that I provide a matte, we can make arrangements privately.</div>
<h4>Carbon &amp; Color Pigment on Stonehenge Natural Printmaking paper</h4>
<div>This is my own ink set up. It is composed of five dilutions of pure carbon inks from MIS Assoc. (carbon ink will never fade), plus magenta and yellow pigment inks by Hewlett Packard, for the brown tone. These HP inks will also last for centuries. The Stonehenge paper is 100% cotton rag, museum grade paper. Prints are made by me (no one else is ever permitted to print my work) using an adapted Epson Stylus Pro 3800. (Prints are less brown than they probably appear in your web browser.)</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h4>Polymer Plate Photogravure on Revere Silk-Ivory Printmaking paper</h4>
<div>There are several methods for making photogravure printing plates. The plates I plan to use are made with newer materials than the traditional copper and gelatin photogravure plates; specifically, PETG plastic instead of copper and a photo-polymer instead of gelatin (gelatin is a natural polymer). I believe the result is the same with either method and far less expensive with polymer plates.</div>
<div>You should know that some respected artists who are still using copper plates, disagree. Some of them insist that what I am doing should be called <i>polymer photogravure</i>, or similar. I've used that terminology here for clarity, but I disagree with the distinction and generally just use <i>photogravure</i>. My argument is that a photogravure consists of ink on paper; ink put there by placing a plate carrying ink in incised areas through an etching press, along with that paper. Both methods involve a plate carrying ink in incised areas. The only differences lie in the materials from which the plates are made and the manner and material of the incising.</div>
<div>Gravure prints that I have made thus far use one of the two papers previously mentioned, Stonehenge or Revere. It is possible I will end up using a different paper altogether, if I find one I like even more. Some of the funds raised will go to buying sample papers for further tests, so that I can be sure the perfect paper is selected.<p></p>
</div>
<h4>Polymer Plate Photogravure on Japanese Tissue...</h4>
<p>In the mid-1980s I was privileged to handle some of the rare and magnificent prints by the brilliant photographer <a href=""http://curtis.library.northwestern.edu/curtis/description.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edward S. Curtis</a>, made on Japanese tissue paper. That was what first interested me in photogravure. I have made a few test gravure prints on Japanese tissue paper, but not as many as on the other papers. This is the only print type I have yet to make enough of to be certain of it being problem-free, though I don't anticipate any game-changing difficulty. This tissue will be either <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped-in_page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tipped-in</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chine-coll%C3%A9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chine collé</a> mounted to Stonehenge paper. This gives the gravure on tissue print a very subtle two-tone, almost three-dimensional look that is utterly <i>not </i>reproducible by any other means.</p>

<p><i>Vergüenza</i></p>
<br/>
</div>
<ul>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need... </h3> <p>I have already acquired most of the equipment and a lot of the materials on my own. The etching press needed to make photogravures was by far the greatest expense. It was purchased in November of 2013. These things of course, do not come cheaply. I am out of cash and that is why this campaign is here.</p>
<p>The biggest current need is a <a href=""http://www.takachpress.com/servlet/the-480/NuArc-26-dsh-1KS-Exposure-System/Detail"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plate burner</a>. That link gives just one example. They are expensive, but necessary. Plates of the type I am making can be exposed oudoors with UV from sunlight, but that is quite inconsistent and very time consuming. With as many as I need to make, sunlight is impractical. Plus, I need the precise exposure control of a plate burner for further research. There are many models of plate burners available running from about $2,500-$5,000 and up. Which one I get, new or used, will depend on the amount that gets raised here. No point in picking out a specific model before knowing how much there is to spend. </p>
<p>Additional materials (all estimates; the more that is raised, the more needed): </p> <ul> <li>
<a href=""http://store.hiromipaper.com/r-011sekishuthickroll.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">R-011 Sekishu Thick Roll</a> Japanese tissue, need 2 ~ total  $1,061.20 + shipping</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.takachpress.com/servlet/the-541/ImagOn-Film/Detail"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Imagon HD Photopolymer</a> Need 4 rolls 24""x25' ~ total of $480 + shipping </li> <li>Small lots of paper for testing to be certain of ideal paper for gravures ~ $150</li>
<li>Stock of paper for gravure printing ~ $500</li> <li>Additional supplies of gravure ink ~ $200</li>
<li>Additional pure carbon + HP color pigment toning inks ~ $300</li>
<li>Stonehenge 4-ply ""Natural"" matte board 100 ~ total approximately $1300</li>
<li>A whole bunch of little things that add up to being <i>not so little</i>
</li>
</ul>
<div>Of course, all of this will be scaled back if not enough is raised, and if I am so lucky as to get more, I desperately need a new camera and lens(es). Mine are getting quite long in the tooth. I would then sell off the camera system I currently have and use the proceeds to stock up on even more equipment/supplies.</div>

<h3>What You Get...</h3>
<div>Except for the very smallest donations, supporters will receive gifts of original signed and numbered prints, of the images in this project. Depending on the donation, there will be:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>carbon &amp; color pigment ink on paper prints (very high end inkjet prints)</li>
<li>photogravure on paper prints</li>
<li>photogravure on Japanese tissue prints</li>
</ul>
<div>When looking at perks, know that I have a method for describing print sizes. I will call a print a ""5X, 10X, 13X"", etc. This means that the short dimension of the paper on which the image is printed is that size. A 5X print is made on a 5""x7"" piece of paper, with the actual image itself being somewhat smaller than that. I never print near the edges of the paper, preferring that images have lots of elbow room. An 11X is either 11""x14"" or 11""x17"" paper, depending on the proportions of the image, the image itself being 8"" or 9"" on the short side, depending on its length. </div>

This campaign is about fulfilling two intertwined goals. First, it is about completing a photographic project I started over 30 years ago, a project that has been thwarted time and time again by bizarre events. And, it is also about the goal of being able to make photogravures, the most difficult, elegant and long-lasting form of photograph printing that has ever existed.

(The images shown throughout will be available as rewards for contributions.)


Borracho
 
History
My name is David Kachel (cockle) and I have been a fine-art B&W, landscape photographer since 1979, with the exception of one brief period during 1980 when I became a street photographer, against my will. My adventure began with the theft of all my photographic equipment at a bus terminal in Lima, Peru in May of 1980. That eventually led to months of wandering the streets of the city of Arequipa, in southern Peru, with a borrowed, antique 35mm camera (the only camera available, and useless for landscape work), a single, uncoated lens and no light meter. It was either street photography, or no photography at all.
An introvert's introvert, I discovered to my astonishment that I loved that sortie into street photography and found it very productive. But, my joy didn't last long.

I could never have replaced my stolen equipment while in Peru and so, after a time was forced to return to the USA. As it turned out, all the film from those months of work on the streets of Arequipa was badly marred by heat-damaged developer acquired in Peru, leaving hundred of tiny marks on every negative and making them all, utterly unprintable. Worse, two darkroom floods over the years damaged a number of negatives further still. Some were destroyed completely. The project languished in my files, untouched and unprinted, for decades. Until the advent of digital photography, they were all thought to be completely unsalvageable.



Entrando a la Iglésia

In the mid-1980s I acquired a strong interest in photogravure, but it was always too expensive to take up, especially for my large landscape work. Only in the last couple of years have advances in technology made it financially feasible to pursue that interest. I started acquiring equipment and experimenting with photogravure printmaking in late 2013.
While contemplating which of my photographs might be suitable to print as photogravures, I remembered the street images from Peru and realized in the same instant that they would be ideal as photogravures and that they might also now be repairable. A move from analog to digital photography begun over six years ago, enabled me over the space of a couple months, to scan and repair those Peru street images... some eighty selected negatives. Thirty-six have been singled out from those eighty. None of these images have ever been exhibited, sold, or even seen publicly before now, save a few web postings made in the last few months, mostly on my new blog:

Project to Include Three Classes of Print

Carbon & Color Pigment on Stonehenge Natural printmaking paper
Polymer Plate Photogravure on Revere Silk-Ivory printmaking paper
Polymer Plate Photogravure on Japanese tissue, tipped-in or Chine collé,to one of the above mentioned papers

Nota Bene: Perk prints are delivered un-matted. I spent a long time determining that the ideal matting material for these prints is Rising Natural 4-ply museum board (sometimes called Kensington) and suggest you ask your framer for the same. If you prefer that I provide a matte, we can make arrangements privately.
Carbon & Color Pigment on Stonehenge Natural Printmaking paper
This is my own ink set up. It is composed of five dilutions of pure carbon inks from MIS Assoc. (carbon ink will never fade), plus magenta and yellow pigment inks by Hewlett Packard, for the brown tone. These HP inks will also last for centuries. The Stonehenge paper is 100% cotton rag, museum grade paper. Prints are made by me (no one else is ever permitted to print my work) using an adapted Epson Stylus Pro 3800. (Prints are less brown than they probably appear in your web browser.)


Polymer Plate Photogravure on Revere Silk-Ivory Printmaking paper
There are several methods for making photogravure printing plates. The plates I plan to use are made with newer materials than the traditional copper and gelatin photogravure plates; specifically, PETG plastic instead of copper and a photo-polymer instead of gelatin (gelatin is a natural polymer). I believe the result is the same with either method and far less expensive with polymer plates.
You should know that some respected artists who are still using copper plates, disagree. Some of them insist that what I am doing should be called polymer photogravure, or similar. I've used that terminology here for clarity, but I disagree with the distinction and generally just use photogravure. My argument is that a photogravure consists of ink on paper; ink put there by placing a plate carrying ink in incised areas through an etching press, along with that paper. Both methods involve a plate carrying ink in incised areas. The only differences lie in the materials from which the plates are made and the manner and material of the incising.
Gravure prints that I have made thus far use one of the two papers previously mentioned, Stonehenge or Revere. It is possible I will end up using a different paper altogether, if I find one I like even more. Some of the funds raised will go to buying sample papers for further tests, so that I can be sure the perfect paper is selected.

Polymer Plate Photogravure on Japanese Tissue...
In the mid-1980s I was privileged to handle some of the rare and magnificent prints by the brilliant photographer Edward S. Curtis, made on Japanese tissue paper. That was what first interested me in photogravure. I have made a few test gravure prints on Japanese tissue paper, but not as many as on the other papers. This is the only print type I have yet to make enough of to be certain of it being problem-free, though I don't anticipate any game-changing difficulty. This tissue will be either tipped-in or Chine collé mounted to Stonehenge paper. This gives the gravure on tissue print a very subtle two-tone, almost three-dimensional look that is utterly not reproducible by any other means.

Vergüenza



   What I Need...  I have already acquired most of the equipment and a lot of the materials on my own. The etching press needed to make photogravures was by far the greatest expense. It was purchased in November of 2013. These things of course, do not come cheaply. I am out of cash and that is why this campaign is here.
The biggest current need is a plate burner. That link gives just one example. They are expensive, but necessary. Plates of the type I am making can be exposed oudoors with UV from sunlight, but that is quite inconsistent and very time consuming. With as many as I need to make, sunlight is impractical. Plus, I need the precise exposure control of a plate burner for further research. There are many models of plate burners available running from about $2,500-$5,000 and up. Which one I get, new or used, will depend on the amount that gets raised here. No point in picking out a specific model before knowing how much there is to spend. 
Additional materials (all estimates; the more that is raised, the more needed):   
R-011 Sekishu Thick Roll Japanese tissue, need 2 ~ total  $1,061.20 + shipping

Imagon HD Photopolymer Need 4 rolls 24""x25' ~ total of $480 + shipping  Small lots of paper for testing to be certain of ideal paper for gravures ~ $150
Stock of paper for gravure printing ~ $500 Additional supplies of gravure ink ~ $200
Additional pure carbon + HP color pigment toning inks ~ $300
Stonehenge 4-ply ""Natural"" matte board 100 ~ total approximately $1300
A whole bunch of little things that add up to being not so little


Of course, all of this will be scaled back if not enough is raised, and if I am so lucky as to get more, I desperately need a new camera and lens(es). Mine are getting quite long in the tooth. I would then sell off the camera system I currently have and use the proceeds to stock up on even more equipment/supplies.

What You Get...
Except for the very smallest donations, supporters will receive gifts of original signed and numbered prints, of the images in this project. Depending on the donation, there will be:


carbon & color pigment ink on paper prints (very high end inkjet prints)
photogravure on paper prints
photogravure on Japanese tissue prints

When looking at perks, know that I have a method for describing print sizes. I will call a print a ""5X, 10X, 13X"", etc. This means that the short dimension of the paper on which the image is printed is that size. A 5X print is made on a 5""x7"" piece of paper, with the actual image itself being somewhat smaller than that. I never print near the edges of the paper, preferring that images have lots of elbow room. An 11X is either 11""x14"" or 11""x17"" paper, depending on the proportions of the image, the image itself being 8"" or 9"" on the short side, depending on its length.

Risks & Challenges 
Devil's advocate...

carbon & color pigment ink on paper ~ zero risk, completely perfected
photogravure on paper ~ very slight risk, under control, I just want a little more
photogravure on Japanese tissue ~ small risk, I've done it, but need finesse 
The carbon & color pigment ink on paper prints can all be delivered within a few weeks of the end of the campaign. The paper photogravures, if everything goes terribly wrong, might take as long as four or five months, though I can't imagine why that would happen. The tissue gravures, assuming extreme adversity, by the end of 2015. I really don't expect any of that to happen, but better you are pleasantly surprised than disappointed. Genuine expectations: I believe everyone should have their images in no more than six months at the outside. I will keep everyone up to date.

<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Expanding the business has been something i have wanted for a long time. Havign to wait for the right house with the right garden, then finding it and Runa being born in the same month just kept things on the back burner. Now it is time time to expand time for bigger projects and finally launching my Knives and Tool Workshop. This is a new venture creating my first set of knives 100% my design 100% made by me i have 3 designs for launching with, a Back up blade full tang, A Folder &amp; a Norse Seax ""Oath Taker"" chopper. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well in everything there is always risks but as i already have an established workshop brand i feel the risks are few but the challenges are many. For example gaining the new skills to wire my workshop or even build a shed... i have never built a shed so this is all new.  So there is many skills and hands needed to be lent to get all this done and i have had a crazy amount of messages from people offering there time when the time comes.</p>
<p>My main worry is if i dont get a fully funded and i need to hand build the shed myself as i dont have much experience builkding but this is just another challenge to get passed and i have been offered help if it is needed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Der U-20 Slam 2016 ist die diesjährige große Poetry Slam Meisterschaft der besten Jungpoet*innen aus deutschsprachigen Ländern. Ein Jahr lang qualifizieren sich junge Poetinnen und Poeten unter 20 Jahren bei lokalen Poetry Slams für dieses Ereignis. 


Vom 18.-23. Oktober 2016 kämpfen dann die besten Jungdichter*innen und Jungdichter in Magdeburg um den Titel des deutschsprachigen U20-Slamchampions.
Die U-20-Meisterschaften gelten als eines der wichtigsten europäischen Literaturfestivals für junge Nachwuchspoet*innen. 

Wer sind wir?



Organisiert und ausgerichtet wird die diesjährige Meisterschaft vom HALternativ Verein. 
Den Halternativ e.V. gibt es seit dem 21. November 2006. Ursprünglich wurde der Verein gegründet, um Arbeitslosen Rockmusikfestivals und Lesungen anzubieten. Mit der Zeit weitete sich das Spektrum des gemeinnützigen Vereins immer weiter auf Kultur- und Literaturveranstaltungen aus. Ab April 2007 kam dann auch der Poetry Slam dazu und ab 2009 folgten weitere Projekte wie 'Kunst Gegen Bares', Lesebühnen, Song Slams oder Science Slams. Neben großen Veranstaltungen mit bis zu 300 Besuchern, bietet der Halternativ e.V. auch kleine Projekte und Workshops an, dies immer mit dem Fokus auf regionaler Künstler*innenförderung. 



Wohin fließt das Geld?

Die U-20 Poetry Slam Meisterschaft mischt das kulturelle Leben in der sachsen-anhaltinischen Landeshauptstadt Magdeburg auf und soll besonders deshalb gefördert werden. Dieses Ereignis wird außerdem dazu beitragen, Magdeburg dem Titel der Kulturhauptstadt 2025 einen großen Schritt näher zu bringen.Die Organisation der 5-tägigen U-20 Poetry Slam Meisterschaft und deren Durchführung erfordert Kraft, Engagement, Ausdauer und, wie ihr euch sicherlich vorstellen könnt, finanzielle Mittel.  Das durch die Kampagne eingenommene Geld fließt ausschließlich in die Vorbereitung und Durchführung der U-20 Poetry Slam Meisterschaft 2016 und dabei vor allem in die Fahrtkosten und Verpflegung der 70 teilnehmenden Slammer*innen, die aus dem gesamten deutschsprachigen Raum angereist kommen.

We are based in Milan since 2010 and we have worked with Italian and international Artists. This year we go out of our country and we we are going to host Australian Aboriginal Art, Chinese Calligraphy Artists, and our friend June Jin, a danish artist born in Korea.<br/><p>And it's how we met her, during a reunion Trip in Seoul for Korean Adoptees from all over the world! we care about human relations and so we decided to have her hosted in our gallery since she's part of a bigger meaning to our life.</p>
<p>And her works are really beautiful, she's a talented artist too!</p>
<p><br/>But we need your help, she's got HUGE paintings and costs for Bringing them from Copenhagen to Milan is pretty expensive, see them on the video please, aren't they big AND beautiful?</p>
<p>WE need your help to help this exposition being done, it is a monumental witness to the meaning of frendship and what it can be achieved to restore human ""belonging"" and care for those who had no chance to have it once they were born.</p>
<p><br/>Your help counts, it is not just a matter of money, it is a gift that you can contribute to give for when it is time to assess that no matter how alone we are in this world, there's people that CARE about human relations.</p>

<p>This is what we bring around the world, this time June Jin is visiting us from Denmark but we have already done Expos and created links with Canada, with artist Neil Snape and we are doing it in China with Artist Luo Qi.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>My name is Nate Kapnicky, also known as ""Nate Kap"". I'm a caricature artist who moved from Columbus, OH to draw at Sea World, San Diego and explore my talents.</p>
<p>I started to really grow a passion for caricatures about 7 years ago. Working live has really given me a perspective of how to be honest with myself as well as the customer to get the ultimate hilarious result. Over the years I developed a fearless artistic nature in which anyone is a challenge and everyone <em>will</em> get equal treatment! <em> </em>I'm never afraid of hurting feelings because my intentions are to make people <em><strong>laugh</strong></em> at themselves or enjoy a unique exaggerated perspective of their image.</p>
<p>After 3 years of drawing live at a theme parks, I decided to make a caricature book in order to further improve my craft.</p>
<p><img alt=""Beasted Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://beastedbook.com/indiegogo/coverphoto.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>BEASTED</h3>
<p>...is, on the surface, a book of extremely exaggerated, surreal takes on some of the most recognizable faces in the world.</p>
<p><img alt=""Brad and Angelina"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://beastedbook.com/indiegogo/Bradgelina.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px 3px;""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Snoop Dog/Lion"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://beastedbook.com/indiegogo/snoop.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px 2px;""/>But <em>BEASTED</em> is more than just a book of my artwork or crazy caricatures of famous figures. It's about taking a different approach to the traditional ways of looking at a face and body. It's about opening minds to explore the uniqueness of every face. It's about inspiring others to take risks and be courageous in their artwork.</p>
<p><em>BEASTED</em> is a movement about challenging people to evaluate themselves and to laugh at their own unique features!</p>
<h2>So What is the Goal?</h2>
<p>In order to get the <em>BEASTED</em> message out, we need to spread the word! The way I would like to do that is by launching a new <strong>blog</strong> full of tutorials and my thoughts on art. I hope for it to be a valuable resource for artists everywhere and to inspire a generation of fearless artists. And also, I need to keep creating more art!</p>
<p>But the first thing I need is a studio space. I'm working from my dining room/kitchen at the moment! Building up a studio is really important to me because it keeps my dreams high and drives me to keep my heart and soul in what I enjoy. And I want to pay that forward to all of you to keep the artistic and FUN energy going.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>The goal is to reach $9,861. First and foremeost, this goes towards <strong>rent on a studio space for a year</strong>. In order to use money wisely, it would only be a second bedroom in addition to the one bedroom space I currently share with my girlfriend who is an artist as well and who helped BEASTED come together. The studio must also act as an office and storage area.</p>
<p>I also need several little things to keep efficient. In order to set up my tutorials and blog, I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tripod for my camera for photographing work</li>
<li>a better microphone for videos</li>
<li>more RAM for my computer, in order to edit large video files</li>
</ul>
<p>I will need items to better create artwork, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>better lighting </li>
<li>an air purifier</li>
<li>fixing my drafting table (it can no longer prop up)</li>
<li>new paint brushes (most of mine are several years old)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the money raised must go towards shipping, taxes, and fees, and will also help with the cost it took to make <em>the books</em>.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","My name is Nate Kapnicky, also known as ""Nate Kap"". I'm a caricature artist who moved from Columbus, OH to draw at Sea World, San Diego and explore my talents.
I started to really grow a passion for caricatures about 7 years ago. Working live has really given me a perspective of how to be honest with myself as well as the customer to get the ultimate hilarious result. Over the years I developed a fearless artistic nature in which anyone is a challenge and everyone will get equal treatment!  I'm never afraid of hurting feelings because my intentions are to make people laugh at themselves or enjoy a unique exaggerated perspective of their image.
After 3 years of drawing live at a theme parks, I decided to make a caricature book in order to further improve my craft.

BEASTED
...is, on the surface, a book of extremely exaggerated, surreal takes on some of the most recognizable faces in the world.

But BEASTED is more than just a book of my artwork or crazy caricatures of famous figures. It's about taking a different approach to the traditional ways of looking at a face and body. It's about opening minds to explore the uniqueness of every face. It's about inspiring others to take risks and be courageous in their artwork.
BEASTED is a movement about challenging people to evaluate themselves and to laugh at their own unique features!
So What is the Goal?
In order to get the BEASTED message out, we need to spread the word! The way I would like to do that is by launching a new blog full of tutorials and my thoughts on art. I hope for it to be a valuable resource for artists everywhere and to inspire a generation of fearless artists. And also, I need to keep creating more art!
But the first thing I need is a studio space. I'm working from my dining room/kitchen at the moment! Building up a studio is really important to me because it keeps my dreams high and drives me to keep my heart and soul in what I enjoy. And I want to pay that forward to all of you to keep the artistic and FUN energy going.


What We Need
The goal is to reach $9,861. First and foremeost, this goes towards rent on a studio space for a year. In order to use money wisely, it would only be a second bedroom in addition to the one bedroom space I currently share with my girlfriend who is an artist as well and who helped BEASTED come together. The studio must also act as an office and storage area.
I also need several little things to keep efficient. In order to set up my tutorials and blog, I need:

a tripod for my camera for photographing work
a better microphone for videos
more RAM for my computer, in order to edit large video files

I will need items to better create artwork, such as:

better lighting 
an air purifier
fixing my drafting table (it can no longer prop up)
new paint brushes (most of mine are several years old)

Some of the money raised must go towards shipping, taxes, and fees, and will also help with the cost it took to make the books.

Get BEASTED!
By helping me reach my goal, you can get a piece of BEASTED with every perk! And in addition to the amazing perks, all contributors will get sneak peaks of tutorials and posts that will go on my blog! You can even have your input on what you want to see on there. The following is a description of the things you will find in the perk packages.

PERKS
BEASTED book: Beasted itself is a 128 page, 10"" x 10"", full color, hardback, Beasted caricature art book.
BEASTED mini: All perks will include the BEASTED mini, a 3"" x 3"", full color, 40 page, bonus caricature book of friends, famous people, animals, and live sketches. Let it serve you as artistic inspiration in your pocket!

BEASTED sticker: You will also get a BEASTED sticker that you can stick anywhere! (Cooler if it's on a ""B"" word)
 
Sketch of Yourself (left): If you get a perk with a BEASTED ""idea"" sketch of yourself or a friend, this is what you can expect!
This sketch is done loose, fun, exaggerated and drawn in pencil.
Original Sketch from the book: This is one of the original progression ""idea"" sketches (as seen in the book) that helped develop the idea for one of the final pieces.
Limited Edition Beasted Poster(right): A limited edition 10"" x 10"" print filled with all the finished pieces seen in the book.
 
 
Now if you REALLY want to get BEASTED, check out these perks! V V V V V

I interned with an organization that empowers girl survivors of human trafficking with the direct services they need to <b>heal</b> and become independent, healthy, happy individuals. From court advocacy, to group therapy, to job and housing searches, girls are offered resources to create the lives that they envision <b>for themselves</b>. All funds that are raised will directly enhance a jewelry-making program that inspires both creativity and entrepreneurship in these young women. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>When girls escape situations of trafficking, they leave with barely any knowledge of how to take care of themselves. Most often, they are homeless and have little more than the clothe on their back. For years, traffickers have told them what to eat, what to wear, and have isolated them from the outside world. They've been made to believe that their trafficker is the only person who actually cares about them, and that <b>sex is all that they are good for. </b>
</div>
<div>With this program, girls learn to make jewelry, which is then sold online and at small sales parties. Girls get 50% of the profit, and the other half is reinvested in the program. Through this, survivors get a creative outlet while learning a valuable skill, which teaches them that they are capable of more than what their traffickers have forced them to think. They also gain a positive and safe method of making money, which encourages the idea that sex <b>isn't </b>the only way that they can do this. Workshops also provide an open space for girls to discuss their feelings, thus creating a supportive network of peers who work together toward success. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>So far, this program has been extremely successful, offering more than 50 survivors per year the opportunity to express themselves. But, as the program grow, supplies have to grow too. Beads, end-pieces, wire, clasps, pliers, wire cutters, and beading boards are all needed to make valuable pieces of jewelry. Since half of all profits are reinvested into the program, these funds will be a necessary boost toward further sustainability. If the entirety of this goal isn't raised, all money will still be donated to this program. But, the more money raise, the better this program can be!</p>
<p>$10 = 100 Beads: Provide these girls with some beads!</p>
<p>$20 = 100 Beads, Wire, End-pieces: Beads, wire, and end-pieces are the basic parts of any piece of jewelry. With this gift, you'll be providing a few girls with all of the parts they need to make fabulous works of art!</p>
<p>$50 = 300 Beads, Wire, &amp; End-pieces: Provide several more girls with supplies to make jewelry!</p>
<p>$100 = 500 Beads, Wire, End-pieces, &amp; Tools: While providing girls with all of the pieces to make jewelry, this donation also encourages the long-term sustainability of the program... Tools are recyclable!</p>

As we sail into our golden years (What the heck does that mean anyway?)  all of us want to keep producing and creating, because:</p><p></p><ul>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">And all of us want to pass down what we have learned to the next generations</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Autumn Hands will be an online marketplace for all of us Artists, Artisans and DIY folks who create beautifully crafted work. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create a robust marketplace with Artisans from every state in the union.  (Yep the territories are included also.)</p>
<p>A site that folks will want to buy from because the work is amazing. And they love knowing each piece was lovingly made by an older Artisan, perhaps in their community.</p>
<p><b>Autumn Hands is registered as a benefits corporation.</b> A relatively new  business status for a “social enterprise,” meaning we have dual bottom lines: make a profit and meet a need(s) in the community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632398/files/20140607123443-logo_expalined.png?1402169683"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3><p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Impact</span><br/></p><p></p>
<p>What needs would Autumn Hands meet? </p>
<p><i>Let me throw some numbers at you. And I do NOT want you to be distressed by this. Because you can help:</i></p>
<p>a. Over 40 million  older Americans (65+) in 2010.</p>
<p>b. Over 11 million live alone.</p>
<p>c. 87% of those 65+ rely on Social Security as their source of income.</p>
<p>d. Almost 4.5 million older folks live below the poverty level.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">What do these numbers have to do with our dream to build an online marketplace for older Artisans?</b><br/></p>
<p>a. There are a LOT of us (yay parents of all us “Boomers”). And you know, of those millions, many are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk.</p>
<p>b. Many, if not all of us, need to connect with others. Again, of those millions, many are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk.</p>
<p>c. Many of us need to augment our incomes. Some of those millions are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk living on very limited income.</p>
<p>d. Some of us live below the poverty level—especially if we have been earning a living as Artists during our “productive” years.</p><h2><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">Inter-generational Sharing:</b></h2>
<p><b><i>ALL of us are grateful for the talents we inherited and nurtured.  </i></b></p>
<p>We’d like to pass down our skills and knowledge: how to knit, make homemade soap, build  a cabinet, create a mosaic, etc. Every Artisan who creates a shop on the Autumn Hands site will be encouraged to partner with a younger person, at least one generation younger (20+ years younger). Imagine the exchange of skills and knowledge between an older Artisan and a younger person eager to learn. Imagine the younger person advising the Ageless Artisan on what is trending in accessories, how to use social media to promote their shop, take better pictures of the work, etc. </p>

<p></p></div>","Why Autumn HandsI've been an Artist all my life—and so have many of my friends. As we sail into our golden years (What the heck does that mean anyway?)  all of us want to keep producing and creating, because:

We simply  are “Creatives” 


Some of us need to financially


And all of us want to pass down what we have learned to the next generations


Autumn Hands will be an online marketplace for all of us Artists, Artisans and DIY folks who create beautifully crafted work. 
Our goal is to create a robust marketplace with Artisans from every state in the union.  (Yep the territories are included also.)
A site that folks will want to buy from because the work is amazing. And they love knowing each piece was lovingly made by an older Artisan, perhaps in their community.
Autumn Hands is registered as a benefits corporation. A relatively new  business status for a “social enterprise,” meaning we have dual bottom lines: make a profit and meet a need(s) in the community.Impact
What needs would Autumn Hands meet? 
Let me throw some numbers at you. And I do NOT want you to be distressed by this. Because you can help:
a. Over 40 million  older Americans (65+) in 2010.
b. Over 11 million live alone.
c. 87% of those 65+ rely on Social Security as their source of income.
d. Almost 4.5 million older folks live below the poverty level.
What do these numbers have to do with our dream to build an online marketplace for older Artisans?
a. There are a LOT of us (yay parents of all us “Boomers”). And you know, of those millions, many are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk.
b. Many, if not all of us, need to connect with others. Again, of those millions, many are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk.
c. Many of us need to augment our incomes. Some of those millions are Artists, Artisans and talented DIY folk living on very limited income.
d. Some of us live below the poverty level—especially if we have been earning a living as Artists during our “productive” years.Inter-generational Sharing:
ALL of us are grateful for the talents we inherited and nurtured.  
We’d like to pass down our skills and knowledge: how to knit, make homemade soap, build  a cabinet, create a mosaic, etc. Every Artisan who creates a shop on the Autumn Hands site will be encouraged to partner with a younger person, at least one generation younger (20+ years younger). Imagine the exchange of skills and knowledge between an older Artisan and a younger person eager to learn. Imagine the younger person advising the Ageless Artisan on what is trending in accessories, how to use social media to promote their shop, take better pictures of the work, etc. 
I said you’d be able to help, and here is how you can:


Spread the word. Send folks to the Indiegogo site for Autumn Hands.
Sign up yourself, or gift your talented grandmom/grandad with a membership. During this campaign, Artisans who sign up to create a shop on the Autumn Hands site will given a two-year membership for the one-year price ($50)

If you live near Lancaster, PA—stop by Roaring Brook Market and Café at 155 East King Street, to check out the crafts, art & domestic arts that demonstrate the quality and creativity of the works you will find on Autumn Hands. The show will be ever changing during the next 60 days.


By contributing and choosing a perk, you help to make this dream happen.
A $5 contribution rewards you with awesome Karma and one hand-felted heart
 
A $25 contribution earns you your choice of a felted leaf or round fruit accessory. You choose which felted accessory you want and if you want the back finished off as a hair barrette or a brooch pin back.Later in the campaign, each image will be posted and you select your favorite. To be fair, we will go in order of contribution date.


The ""Incorrigible Woman"" print below is offered to those contributing $ 50


The ""Joy"" print below is offered to those contributing $40


A $1,000 contribution to our effort earns you a personalized mosaic mirror. Approx 400 sq inches. Your mirror comes framed. Here are two examples:
This is what your contributions will be paying for:

Software & development of online marketplace


Hosting & maintenance


Artisan Coaching & Customer Assistance

Reaching out to younger generations

What you are really getting for your hard-earned investment is a wonderful marketplace for shoppers to choose hand-crafted works by Ageless American Artisans. And an opportunity for our Artisans to augment their income and to connect with younger generations, collaborating and sharing.Because what we leave behind are the works and people we create.From the bottom of my heart, thank you for helping make this dream come true.Blessings on your own journey, Deirdre(The above stats were compiled in the report: “A Profile of the Older American” based on 2010  US Census.

<p>On September 27, 2014, <i>Redskin, </i>a pop-up solo art exhibition including paintings/installations and an 8 hour long performance art by Indigenous artist Gregg Deal (Pyramid Lake Paiute) will premiere during the annual Washington DC event <em><i>Art All Night: Nuit Blanche.</i></em> During the course of <i>Art All Night</i>, Gregg Deal will subject himself to a variety of abuses  -- mental, verbal and even physical -- routinely endured by Indigenous people. These interactions will be documented and translated into a short film of the same name. Your support of this campaign is key to the ongoing Indigenous art/activism that grounds Gregg's work, particularly within the context of the issues surrounding the Washington DC NFL franchise.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Is Needed </h3> <p>This campaign is purely donation and/or sponsorship driven. <b>Donations or Sponsorship can come from individuals or businesses.</b>  Incentives will be provided in the form of pure hearted thanks in the film, and in the case of more substantial donations and/or sponsorship, prominent acknowledgement will be made on all collateral media such as the website, posters, printed materials at the exhibition, or even written pieces by the artist. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Funds are needed to cover a variety of expenses. In conjunction with the performance piece, Deal will have paintings that coincide with the performative work.

<p></p>
<p><b><i>Synopsis</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In his performance piece during <i>Art All Night</i>, Gregg Deal will subject himself to abuse mirroring the various types of injury routinely endured by Indigenous people. Executing this piece within the Nation’s capitol is especially provocative as it is part of an ongoing conversation about the problematic and racially charged name and imagery associated with the Washington Football Team, The Redskins. While Deal’s performance stands as an illustration of the racism directed towards Indigenous people (including Deal), it is part of a greater statement about the incredible amount of inequality, bigotry, and misunderstanding experienced by Indigenous people, often expressed through both covert and overt hostility. As an indigenous person, Deal will exhaustively endure abuse, a taxing effort mentally, physically and spiritually. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Examples of scenarios within the performance</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At least 3 non-Indian participants will work as antagonists for this piece, subjecting Deal to the aforementioned abuse. Here are a few scenarios:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Red Face</b>: Non-Indians dressed with “Indian war paint” and “fake headdress” try to convince Deal their actions honor him.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>""<b>You’re just not Indian enough""</b>: Antagonists will evaluate Deal's identity, speaking critically about his conformity to stereotype (e.g., ""you don’t look Indian to me,"" explaining the ways they perceive his identity as a Native person). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Redskins</b>: Singing the team song “Hail To The Redskins”, preaching about honor, listing off other arguments and ""Facts.""</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Purpose</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The truth of microagression towards the Indigenous in America is overlooked at best and supported warmly at worst. This piece is meant to interrogate the experience of the Indigenous in America and the way others engage with them. Additionally, this piece is very personal and reflects the artist’s own experience, specifically the lack of control Deal has felt throughout his lifetime with regard to his identity. Of course all of this becomes even more provocative within the context of the “Redskin” debate, which will be explicitly referenced throughout the performance piece. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>End Result</i></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This interactive performance will be thoroughly document through photography and film, and will ultimately comprise the subsequent short film. Reactions from the crowd, interviews, and the many social and philosophical aspects of this piece will drive the content, using art as a vehicle through which the inequality experienced by Indigenous people is made clear.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Your donation supports art and its use as a powerful tool of activism and education. Your donation makes the statement that you support the continued grass roots effort to change the problematic attitudes and perceptions American Culture holds about Indigenous people, that you support changing the name of the Washington Redskins, and that you support the art of Gregg Deal, an important Indigenous voice in contemporary art. </p>

<p>My digital portrait sketches are basically like a slightly stylized, less-detailed version of my normal digitally painted portraits.  This is for the digital file only. <br/><br/>For these, I'll be sketching/drawing in one main colour.  These will be more stylized and loose than my fully-painted portraits.  I will need a reference photo and what colour you'd like me to use!  Since these are pretty simple, no edits will be included--basically these pieces will be my interpretation (in the above style) of whatever reference photo you send me! :D  <br/><br/>I will be collecting photos and other information after the campaign is over.<br/><br/>For full-colour, digitally painted portraits, see the ""Custom Digital Portrait"" tier.</p>

<p>I am offering more of the digital portraits, at my NORMAL, non-IG discounted price.  Unfortunately, I have so many on my plate that I will not be able to even START until next year (beginning of 2016 at the earliest).  </p>
<p>If you are in no hurry, then this is the option for you!  The requirements and everything are the same as above, the only differences are the prices and the delivery dates.  I cannot guarantee these will be done by any dates, and with the ones above, you will only get one round of edits.  This price is for the digital file only.  Make sure you read through the entire thing above so you know all the details of how it works!  :D</p>

</div></div>","My name is Megan Lara and I'm a 26 year-old illustrator currently living in Chicago with my boyfriend--another artist named Omega Man 5000 (Harry)--and my corgi. Harley.  Most of you who know my work probably found me through Teefury or various other tee-a-day sites.  I do a lot of pop culture inspired design, specifically work in the art nouveau style.   I am so thankful that I have been able to live my dream life and create art for a living, and with your help I can continue to do so!  :D You can see some of my work here:  













Simply put, I decided to start this campaign because we are in a little bit of a jam right now. This year has been rough for us;  several health and personal issues--along with poor timing have depleted the money we had set aside to move into our new home/studio in June (as well as money set aside to purchase inventory for convention season and pay taxes).  



At the moment we live with three other roommates, but our lease is up June 1st.  We absolutely must move by June 1st, and with the aforementioned heath and monetary issues we've faced this year, we don't have enough money to make the move and all of our prior commitments (cons and such).  


We want to use this campaign to escape this predicament quickly, while offering you exclusive art, commissions, prints, and stickers in return.  I'd been wanting to open up commission spots anyway, so this will kill two birds with one stone! :D This is also the first time I'll be offering exclusives, which I'm excited about. 

 
We are asking for $7500 in order to cover our move and build back up our funds.  Here's a breakdown:
Fees from IndieGogo (9% if we don't meet our goal, 4% if we do), Paypal (3%) and Credit Cards (3%) 
Cost of fulfilling perks (prints, stickers, shipping, packaging, etc. costs are a large portion of the amount were asking)
First and last month's rent, deposit, pet deposit, application fees for our apartment, Uhaul, any other misc. moving expenses   
Prints for upcoming conventions and restocking Etsy prints
The rest of our taxes

If we meet our goal, anything extra will be used to get back to where we were before this year sideswiped us. If we meet our goal, we will definitely be adding a few extra goodies to everyone's rewards, as well.  





This is why you're here!  I tried to put together an assortment of things for those interested in either custom artwork,  wall art and exclusives.  I hope something here strikes your fancy! 

A couple notes about perks:  


Regarding Add-Ons:  Unfortunately Indiegogo doesn't allow add-ons or combining perks, so you will have to make separate contributions for each perk you would like.  Very sorry about the inconvenience!  


Choosing Postcard Sets:  You can either email me (info@meganlara.com) with which postcard set you would like, message me on here, or wait for me to contact you after the campaign is over! :)  





Surprise sticker! I will randomly choose a sticker for you--or if you'd rather it not be a TOTAL surprise, you can let me know a specific piece that you want (check out my Redbubble store to see all the designs I have currently).  I will also be including a surprise postcard that will be exclusive to this campaign!Ideal for smooth flat surfaces like laptops, journals, windows etc. They are easy to remove and made from waterproof vinyl. Should last 18 months outdoors

Estimated Shipping Date: September 2015







My digital portrait sketches are basically like a slightly stylized, less-detailed version of my normal digitally painted portraits.  This is for the digital file only. For these, I'll be sketching/drawing in one main colour.  These will be more stylized and loose than my fully-painted portraits.  I will need a reference photo and what colour you'd like me to use!  Since these are pretty simple, no edits will be included--basically these pieces will be my interpretation (in the above style) of whatever reference photo you send me! :D  I will be collecting photos and other information after the campaign is over.For full-colour, digitally painted portraits, see the ""Custom Digital Portrait"" tier.
Estimated delivery:  Before December 2015




A 12""x18"" giclee art print on Somerset Velvet paper (with a one inch white border all the way around, so the image size will be 10""x16"").  It will only be available for backers of this campaign.  Once the campaign is over, it will be retired!  This is the first limited edition print I've ever done.  These will be signed and numbered on the front in the white border--this edition is limited to 100 pieces. Fancy!  :D
U.S. shipping included in price - Please add $5 for outside the U.S.
Estimated delivery:  Before December 2015







Custom digital portraits!  You do not receive a physical print with this order--this is for the DIGITAL FILE only!

This type of portrait is ideal for Facebook profile pictures, website avatars, business cards, framed prints, etc. It would make a great gift for birthdays, anniversaries and holidays! :D  I would greatly prefer for these to be portraits from the waist up to keep it as more of a portrait style commission :)
What you will receive from me:



A portrait painted in my personal style with minimal background. 


 These will be based off of whatever photo you send me—no “draw me as *specific character*” please. 


 You will receive an 11”x14” print-ready digital file (JPEG) along with print release.  


 I will only do one round of edits, because otherwise the back-and-forth between everyone would keep me from getting them all done in a timely manner.  However, you can trust that I will do my best to make sure you love your portrait! :)  


What I need from you:  



 After the campaign is over, I will send out emails and such asking for your photo/name/colour preferences.  If you have a specific date you'd like it completed by, I will do my very best to accommodate it, but I cannot guarantee it for sure.  But I will certainly try!


The Process:  



When the portrait is complete, I will send you a small version for your approval. 


After your approval, I will email you full-sized file and print release. 


Photo Specifics



It is EXTREMELY hard to draw a portrait based on a tiny, dark, or blurry photo. Please try to only send me images that are over 500px wide/tall, clear and with decent lighting. 


Please make sure the photo is mostly focused on the face/upper body. I do much better work with faces than I do with full body portraits. :) 

The best portraits are based on photos that aren't heavily edited or overexposed.
I'd love to have multiple photos that I can use, if you can--just let me know which one you would prefer I base it mostly on.

Please add an additional $80 per person including babies (they are actually hard to draw!) and $60 per pet--up to three total individuals in the portrait.  
Estimated delivery:  Before December 2015





BAD WOLF  9""x12""  CHARCOAL AND PENCIL SKETCH  - $125 

A sketch of Rose Tyler as Bad Wolf!  Size is 9x12 inches.  Will be shipped flat with Indiegogo exclusive postcard as well. :)  Only one available!  I'll try and get a better pic soon!


Please add $10 for shipping outside the U.S.


Estimated delivery:  Will ship ASAP--hopefully around the beginning of June. I will keep you updated!  






I am offering more of the digital portraits, at my NORMAL, non-IG discounted price.  Unfortunately, I have so many on my plate that I will not be able to even START until next year (beginning of 2016 at the earliest).  
If you are in no hurry, then this is the option for you!  The requirements and everything are the same as above, the only differences are the prices and the delivery dates.  I cannot guarantee these will be done by any dates, and with the ones above, you will only get one round of edits.  This price is for the digital file only.  Make sure you read through the entire thing above so you know all the details of how it works!  :D

Base price for one person is $150.  It's an extra $100 for each person (up to two people extra--this price includes babies).  $80 for a pet.  I will also offer a few separate pet portrait spots.  You can have up to three subjects in a portrait (Parents + baby, Couple + cat, three kids, etc.)  Please include the extra costs in your contribution.  I will be collecting all portrait details AFTER the campaign is over.  Don't worry--I'll make sure to get everyone!  
PLEASE keep in mind there is absolutely no way I can begin these until 2016 at the earliest.  But I wanted to offer them because I feel bad they sold out so quickly--so as long as you are not in a hurry, here you go!  A few more spots for you.  I will keep you all updated along the way so you won't think I've forgotten.  :) 


Pet Portrait Redux
Same deal as above, but prices are $100 base cost, $80 for each extra pet, up to three extra pets.  <3

Estimated delivery:  Will begin them  at the earliest of January 2016, hopefully completed by December 2016 -- I will keep you updated!  


    


There are no risks for you guys whatsoever!  No matter what:  you will get your perks even if we don't hit our campaign goal (although it will be a lot easier to fulfill perks and move into the new apartment if we do hit it :D).  
Most perks are set to go out pretty far in the future, just in case we run into any difficulties.  I would rather surprise you by getting your perks way earlier than expected than have to keep pushing back dates.  Those who order only postcards/other print items will receive their rewards before those who order commissions, so keep that in mind.  :)  So while it may seem like it will be a while before you get your perks (before December 2015), I promise that:


We will keep you guys updated every step along the way

You might (if you order prints, you most likely will) get your perks well before the estimated delivery date

And most importantly, you will get your rewards no matter what--so this campaign has no risk for you all whatsoever.  We will make it happen :D  










Shipping is included if you are in the U.S.  For those outside of the U.S., please see the specific perk for how much you need to add to your reward.  
If you want multiple rewards, you will have to complete the process for each reward you want, as IndieGogo doesn't let you combine them.  Sorry about that!
I'll follow up with everyone for specifying which postcard sets you want, commission info, etc., after the end of the campaign! :D  I will begin fulfilling perks the week or two after we make the move!
For any other questions or info or perk choices, email me at info@meganlara.com! :D












If you can't contribute right now, I would really appreciate any and all shares on social media.  Getting the word out about this is half the battle!  I would be so grateful for any help in that regard!  Tell your friends/followers/mom--whoever you feel might be interested in some of the perks, or who would just wanna help out :D

<br/><p></p></span><p></p></div>","Check out Paradise Magazine's official website and Facebook page!THE DREAM:Nearly one year ago, I took on the enormous task of creating a beautiful 200-page magazine as I saw an opportunity to reshape the medium's traditional formula and breathe originality into its values and aesthetics.  By curating a varied group of over 45 artists, musicians, actors, writers, and photographers (all of which donated 100% of their time, energy, and work), I believe Paradise Magazine succeeds in providing original, thoughtful, and intriguing content in a rare style.  As of right now, Paradise is an annual publication, with the goal of becoming bi-annual in time, hiring paid employees, and producing related short-run printed projects and art books.THE PRODUCT:The theme for Paradise Magazine’s debut issue is ‘A Bicoastal View’ and features a wide range of artists and cultural aspects pertaining to San Francisco, CA, and New York, NY.  Because of Paradise’s independence from any corporate sponsorship, the 200 pages of content are free to explore vast dualities by stretching out all extremes, be that old & young age, high & low class, or heteronormative & genderfucked representations of style and sexuality.  There are no rules to Paradise, other than the content must remain entertaining and sincere.The REALITY:Becoming a printed object is vital to the Paradise Magazine aesthetic and philosophy. Each custom layout (templates be damed) would never transfer to the computer screen as effectively as they would from paper in your own hands.  Removed from digital distractions, a printed magazine holds your attention far longer than any blog post or tweet, allowing the in-depth interviews, articles, and fashion editorials to truly sit, resonate, and stick with you. This experience comes at a cost however (as printing fees are never as cheap as compressing a digital PDF), due in part to the magazine’s print quantity, page count, and high quality construction, which features vivid colors, soft matte paper, and sturdy covers.  Your donation will turn Paradise into something that exists in the real world; a physical object, an art piece.AFTER PUBLICATION: Paradise Magazine is poised to sell online and in a variety of bookstores, boutiques, and contemporary museums in various cities throughout California and New York. By the end of Spring 2014, an online store will premiere on the Paradise website, selling original t-shirts and artwork related to the publication. 100% of the profits will go towards funding Issue 2.Along with the Paradise merchandise, various contributors from Issue 1 will be invited to sell their own artwork, music, and designs. 100% of those profits will go directly to the contributing artists. 
CONTRIBUTORS:These 45+ artists are tomorrow’s movers and shakers; get to know them before fame and fortune blows their minds. One of the best and brightest aspects of creativity is that initial spark of creation.  Paradise Magazine is the spark before the inferno.Vain Hein of Daddies Plastik, Lusties of The Lusty Lady, artist Lindsay Laven,Cassandra Sechler and Craig Jacobson of Dreams For Dead Cats, artist JxMarie, Linda Martinez the muse, JJ Brine and Lena Marquise of The Labiancas, Miss Coney Island 2011 Lefty Lucy, documentarian Quintessa Matranga, stage actor Alex Nee of American Idiot & Once, photographer Antonio De Lucci, artist Quinn Corey, Voz CEOJasmine Aarons, Mark Rosen of Museum Hack, the band mates of Bitter Fruit, Meow Mix founder Ferosha Titties, author Rhianna Jones, choreographer Lauren Lasorda, actor Dylan Wittrock, photographer Spencer Kohn, jewelry designer Sammi-Jo Rocco,Sextronixxx Entertainment, photographer Joseph Dwyer, musician Shawn Barry, clothing designer Shelby Grochowski, SF socialite Erica Overold, poet Willie G., comedian Dana Robie, stage actress Hannah Bear, performance artist Efferfesence Jackson, clothing designer Renee Torres, artist Eli McNally, actress Tess Bellomo, jet-setter Adrian Bellomo, documentarian Lucas Waldron, writer Zack Powers, Neon Music of YouthQuake, performance artist Rey Alejandro, photographer Manual SoakedinSoul, and Paradise Magazine editor B.B. Gunn.
IN CONCLUSION:An entire year will have passed by the completion of this project, from studying vintage magazines in my bedroom, to interviewing dozens of artists from SF to NY, to spending the hours and hours and hours it takes to record, transcribe, edit, collect imagery, and layout just one interview.  Paradise Magazine has surpassed becoming a labor of love or a crazed obsession, but a seemingly endless way of life….and I couldn’t be happier with the experience.-B.B.

<p><b>Rock art?</b> Paintings

art in the Sahara is threatened by vandalism, extremists, theft and mineral exploitation</p><p><b>AND</b> because rock art is an important heritage, educational resource, and can provide a livelihood for communities living near it</p>
<p><b>The Sahara?</b> The Sahara
Desert is the most diverse rock art gallery in Africa! And the art there is in peril.</p>
<p><b>How much?</b> $60,000</p>
<p><b>Why?</b> $20,000 is
approximately what we need to record in one country. We’d like to do 3.</p>

We’re raising
funds to document previously undocumented and endangered rock art sites in the Sahara
Rock art? Paintings
and carvings on rock done thousands of years ago. They provide the oldest evidence of human creativity and thought
Why? Because rock
art in the Sahara is threatened by vandalism, extremists, theft and mineral exploitationAND because rock art is an important heritage, educational resource, and can provide a livelihood for communities living near it
The Sahara? The Sahara
Desert is the most diverse rock art gallery in Africa! And the art there is in peril.
How much? $60,000
Why? $20,000 is
approximately what we need to record in one country. We’d like to do 3.
Who are you? We’re
glad you asked: the Trust for African Rock Art. We record, disseminate and
preserve (alongside communities) Africa’s rich rock art heritage.

“＃Share Your Last Minute” is the first public art project presented by Mo+ CA Projects, it is one of the creative events in ArtWeek Boston this year. The original concept is  from the simple belief that people could be reconnected outside of the virtual world by sharing the moments of our life. Meanwhile, we will exam the need for social interaction and the push-and-pull of situating “me” in a “we” world by this project.

Further inspired by the idea of ""deduction photography"" that developed by the Japanese Photographer Takuma Nakahira, which underlines the aesthetic subjectivity of our eyes.Through documenting things indiscriminately with a camera, Takuma demonstrates the aesthetic subjectivity of human’s eye. 

We are hoping this project will create aspiration for all participants through the artistic talent that born with each of us.

<h3>Welcome to the Nimbus campaign!</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am Dalton Bissell of DB-Tops and I want you to see my newest air powered spinning top, The Nimbus. This thing is very cool. My favorite thing about it is its cloud-like silhouette. It does such a great job of artfully concealing its true function of a speedy little turbine. After you give it a spin, a swift breath of air will cause this top to accelerate. It can go really fast! </p>
<p>Since spinning the Nimbus is addicting fun, I decided to include a spin station in my campaign to corral those wilder spins. (It's easy to get a little overzealous as the Nimbus gets up to speed.) This station is a real trooper and is armored up in 550 paracord! It's ready to adventure so you can spin your tops anywhere you like. It's damn near drop-proof, fits in your pocket, and comes in some sweet color patterns (more details below).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516597221/jiiwmacklbtu1637k60m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Making spinning tops is my passion and it's more work than you might think. I have some colleagues that offer  great critique, but mostly I do all the work you see myself. I am the Concept Artist, 3D Modeler, Machinist, Photographer, Videographer, Actor, Video Editor, Director, Marketing Director, and Customer Support Representative. I am really grateful for you, the audience, and I need your support in order to chase this wild dream. With more support I can go farther with this passion of mine and turn it into something that I can support my family with. If you can't contribute to the campaign but still want to help out, share my story with your friends and on your social media pages. It helps a lot!</p>

<h3>More about the Nimbus</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516596729/kvpkrbp8pzem3qomypbw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Nimbus is made of stainless steel, it's 1 ⅛ inches wide, weighs about 27g, and spins for about 4 minutes. It comes with your choice of bearing: Ruby (red), Silicon Nitride (black ceramic), or Tungsten Carbide (silver). </p>
<p>The Nimbus Mini is made of brass, it's 3/4 of an inch wide, weighs about 8g, and spins for about 2 ½ minutes. It also comes with your choice of bearing: Ruby (red), Silicon Nitride (black ceramic), or Tungsten Carbide (silver). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516596816/hg6gdrq3lpgljp2samzi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Both spinning tops are 3d printed and then turned on a lathe to ensure accuracy. The bearing is then pressed into the top with a vice. Lastly, they are spin tested and packed with care.</p>
<p>The air powered function of these tops works best if you aim straight down, perpendicular to the top. With 4 or 5 swift breaths you could be hitting the maximum speed! Using a straw can help supply strong, accurate air power to the Nimbus. It's normal (and safe) for a little condensation to leave the straw or collect on the glass lens. Have fun!</p>
<h3>More about the Spin Stations</h3>
<p>The spinning glass is a 75mm double concave lens with a focal length of 200mm. It's our favorite everyday lens, being affordable to replace and durable enough for your pocket. The silicone band does a nice job of keeping your tops safe from the glass edge if a spin gets out of control, while the Paracord Armor makes these lenses almost drop proof. Need to see it to believe it? Here's a video!</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozMjkpy2xyU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>After the campaign is over you can still get a replacement glass at <a href=""http://www.DB-Tops.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.DB-Tops.com</a> for about $7, or a whole new station for about $12.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal!</h3>
<p>I have always wanted to attempt breaking the world record for the longest assisted spin with a spinning top. If this campaign can reach a funding of %1000, I will try my hardest to break the record this year with the Guinness World Book of Records. This requires a Guinness World Book judge to travel to me to witness my attempt, so I can't mess up even once. The goal? One long continuous spin using just the power of my own breath for a target of over 8 hours. I'll stream it live so you can watch me huff and puff all day long. I'll also show you all some of my other tops in the down time. Wish me luck!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>After launching several other top designs I'm very familiar with the risks and challenges. The biggest problem faced when making tops is getting them well-balanced. There are always going to be one or two tops in a batch that wobble for one reason or another. To handle this issue, I make extra stock of the tops and personally test each one before they are packaged. </p>
<p>The other main challenge to overcome is shipping. I plan to ship with USPS first class, tracking numbers included. This is the very same method I use for my website, <a href=""http://www.DB-Tops.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.DB-Tops.com</a>, and it has proven to be very effective. My domestic shipping customers generally receive their items in 3-5 days. I am confidant in my shipping abilities and will deliver these tops in a timely manner because I have the experience to do so.</p>

<p>Stuccoettes are sculptures made from plaster that you hang on your wall. Stuccoettes come from Paul Griffin’s own unique designs and are made to the highest quality.</p>
<p>Paul has worked with plaster for over 20 years and from developing a keen interest in design during his primary degree in the University of Limerick. He has also completed various courses including sculpturing course in National College of Art and Design (NCAD) in Ireland and a mould making course in Italy. In the past, Paul and his team have completed commissioned work in some of Dublin’s most historical and iconic buildings and he has now decided to bring his own range of Plaster Sculptures called Stuccoettes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where did the name Stuccoette come from?</p>
<p>During the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century, Dublin was commonly regarded as the second city of the British Empire and during this period Dublin went through a golden age of fine building. Using hand modelling and mould making many of the ceilings and cornices in these prestigious buildings were decorated with beautiful Plaster Sculptures in-situ crafted by Stuccodores and a lot of the enrichments from this period would have “ette” at the end their name such as Flowerette and Rosette.</p>
<p>Paul and his team have worked on numerous buildings from this period including Trinity College Dublin and The National Art Gallery restoring some of this beautiful plasterwork.</p>
<p>Stuccoette combines “Stuccodore” and “Ette” showing respect to the past but also brings the plaster sculptures into the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What are the Stuccoettes made from?</p>
<p>The Stuccoettes are made from a high quality casting plaster. Mesh is also added to strengthen the Stuccoettes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What colour are the Stuccoettes?</p>
<p>The Stuccoettes are off white in colour which is the natural colour of the plaster. We put a coat of sealer to seal the Stuccoettes before they are shipped.</p>
<p>The Stuccoettes are beautiful in off white but they can also be painted to match the existing décor. However, we recommend that a professional carry’s out the painting. If you are an experienced painter then adding paint would give a nice personal touch to your Stuccoette.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How are the Stuccoettes hung on the wall?</p>
<p>The hanging apparatus consists of two parts. The first part is embedded into the Stuccoette and the second is fixed to the wall. Once the second part is firmly fixed to the wall you just slide the first into it. Both the first and second part will be provided with the Stuccoette.</p>
<p>The hanging device leaves a space of 20mm (nearly an inch) between the wall and the Stuccoette all the way around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Size of the sculptures</p>
<p>The Wave is 450mm X 450mm or 18 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p>Flow is 650mm X 450mm or 26 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p>Ripples is 450mm X 450mm or 18 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p>The Rose is 450mm X 450mm or 18 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p>Croagh Patrick is 650mm X 450mm or 26 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p>Busy is 650mm X 450mm or 26 inches X 18 inches</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where do we ship the Stuccoettes to and how much does shipping cost?</p>
<p>We ship to anywhere in the world and the cost of shipping is included in the price.</p>

MEET OUR TEAM




Artur Mikaelyan is not only the brain and the moving power behind this project, but also an award winning animator in Armenia, who very soon, thanks to your support, will become a world known animator from Armenia.
Geghayr Khlghatyan, author of number of classic musical works who showed himself brightly in a new genre - where classical, folk, pop and national music have been mixed. Every time he listenes to the music of ""Anban Huri"", he askes very surprised if this is the music written by him :) So, he is also a funny guy. 


Igor Patrin works at the Institute of Theatre and Cinematography as a professor of the Department of Visual Arts and Animation. He has been actively involved in the creation process of many well-known and wonderful Armenian cartoons such as «Գտնված երազը», «Մկների ժողովը», etc. Now, with all his energy he transfers his valuable knowledge to a younger generation and works on  the ""Anban Huri"" cartoon for the Armenian and International audience. 

Lilia Hakobyan's  each day is full of colours - as working in the field of animation for the last 15 years she simply can not live without all those fantastic and colorful creations she draws daily!

Gayane Babayan, with 7 years experience in animation and cartoon industry adds flavor to the heroes of the cartoon and is capable to draw movements of any difficulty and present it in the cartoon. By the way Gayane is Artur's wife and they have a wonderful son. 

Arevik Avanesyan, after being introduced to the wonders of animation, she can't do stop working, drawing and bringing her background experience in dress modeling into the fascinating cartoon industry. 

Mariam Poghosyan graduated Yerevan State Academy of Fine Arts and is responsible for the creation of backgrounds in the ""Anban Huri"" cartoon. With a fascinating sense of beauty and kindness she works days and nights to deliver the best and the most accepted version for the cartoon. 
Zabel Babayan, or Belka as we call her, is the colorist of the whole project. Do you see the colors in Anban Huri? If you like those colours and want to watch the movie over and over again - blame it on Zabel and her professionalism!

Eka Horstka has graduated from Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory and has performed concerts in various countries. She has kindly agreed to play on behalf of Huri in the cartoon.

Astrid Eksuzyan's beautiful voice is the voice of Huri's mother. Just check the demo version and see how wonderful she sounds and how attracting Huri's mother sings about Huri! So this is all Astrid and only Astrid :)

Nvard Hovakimyan is performing at the Paronyan State Theatre and has graduated from the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory. She exactly performed the role of the gossiping neighbor. 

Ani Adilkhanyan has graduated from the Yerevan Komitas State Conservatory and performs another neighbour in the cartoon. 



Arusyak Simonyan and Hasmik Arakelyan are the authors of the texts in this cartoon heroes sing. They have inspired even the small beetle to speak and sing with a very sweet voice. 




DID YOU LIKE OUR TEAM? AREN'T WE WONDERFUL? 
Our team was successful in creating the ""Drunk Hens"" (Հարբած հավերը - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlwe0SUPg6w) cartoon, which became kids' favorite and received around 800,000 hits on Youtube.  The ""Drunk Hens"" cartoon  received also Robert Sahakyants first prize for the best animation movie at the YES EM Festival in in 2008.
Being a new word in the Armenian cartoon industry -  ""Anban Huri"" will become Armenian kids' favorite, introducing them to the Armenian culture and Literature.

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2016 I traveled to Svalbard to take part in the Arctic Circle Artists' Residency. Along with 25 other artists, writers and musicians I sailed on board the barquentine Antigua around the archipelago, eventually making it to the pack ice at 81º 08.3563 north of the equator.<br/><br/>While in the Arctic I took thousands of photographs, and began to develop ideas for art projects. In the Soviet ghost town of Pyramiden I was struck by the sea blue interior paint, peeling in many places to reveal island-like clusters of the white primer beneath. Fascinated, but not knowing what I would do with them, I took dozens of photos. Upon my return I made 100 drawings of these ""arctic maps,"" as though to map their territory.<br/><br/>As I began making the drawings I realised I wanted to produce a limited edition book -- an absurd guide or atlas collecting all 100 drawings. I am appealing to supporters and contributors to help make this possible.<br/><br/>I have researched several printing options, including the mock-up version seen in the images here, and have discovered that I can make a short run of 25-100 high quality books -- with cloth covers, cloth taped spines, embossed foil title, heavy weight paper stock, and colored endpapers -- through Bookmobile in Minneapolis. While it will cost more than the pictured mock-up version, the difference in quality will be worth it.<br/><br/>You can see samples of Bookmobile's short-run work here:<br/><a href=""http://www.bookmobile.com/art-book-printing/short-run-hardcover-book-printing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bookmobile.com/art-book-printing/sho...</a><br/><br/>The cost per book varies depending on the number of books I print, so this campaign is also a way to ascertain interest and determine the length of the run.<br/><br/><strong>What I Need</strong><br/>In order to go forward with this project I need to raise between $1000-$2000. The more I raise the more copies I will produce. If I can print enough I will have copies to distribute to art libraries and bookstores beyond the online sales.<br/><br/><strong>What You Get</strong><br/>By supporting my campaign you will pre-order a copy of the book at cost.

â€œAmazement awaits us at every cornerâ€ (James Broughton)





      Everyone has a story to tellâ€¦
There are many ways to tell a story....

      Be part of it and help us tell ours!


............................................................................
â€žWonderous
Stories - from Xenophobia to Amazementâ€ 
was created for
bringing a better understanding on Xenophobia in everyday life.

This project aims at bringing young people together to tell stories beyond formalized techniques, by using Media
and Performance Arts as means of expression, with a
focus on social and cultural aspects. 

We chose to work with Xenophobia because we
believe that every one of us experiences it, in one way or another. When we
face something new or strange, there is a moment of choice: 
to be amazed or to be fearful...

We want to explore the paths and subtilities that lead to this moment of
choice.
We believe that Stories help shape Cultures
and the interaction between cultures can create a broad
spectrum of experiences, from xenophobia to amazement. This perspective gave us the motivation to
reinvest stories with meaning as to deliver a powerful message, where this has
been lost through formalized techniques.
 
Together with Olde Vechte Foundation, a non-profit,
non-governamental organization in the Netherlands, and 8 International Partners
from cultural and art organizations established in Lithuania, France, Denmark, Romania, Slovakia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland and the Netherlands,
we will gather 45 young talented people to work with the theme of Xenophobia,
by communicating ideas and feelings unpretentiously through storytelling and
live performances.  


..................................................................................
the mission


We
do not aim at fighting Xenophobia! The first contact with a different culture and behavior of a person is one of the  most distinctive moments of experience and it creates an emotion (energy in motion). The energy is already there, so we are not focusing on fighting it but rather understanding it and giving it a new meaning!

Our
mission is to stimulate an intercultural dialogue and to challenge mutual
learning, by creating awereness on xenophobia and the exclusion effect it can have in a society and by encouraging the
use of universal language of images and sounds, that is a language
close to everybody, regardless of education, race, ethnicity, religion etc. 



The
participants of this project will spend together 15 days in Ommen, the
Netherlands, in February 2012, working with concepts like Xenophobia and
Amazement, using media (video and photography) and performance arts (dance,
theater, music)


The final Outcome of the project will consist of 2
performances in the Netherlands, one in Ommen and one in another city in
the Netherlands, which will be live streamed on the internet. 
Once
arrived back home, the participants will organize an International Video
Production. A series of DVDs and prints will be designed and
distributed across Europe with content related to the exchange and the
performances presented.

project has a Basic Fund that can support us in realizing it. We still find ourselves in need for
the amount of  5000$ in order to ensure the artistic quality of the project. We have invited Experts that will support the young artists during the for Workshop and Production days that will lead to the Performances.

We have invited experts from the
team of choreographers of Random Collision (NL), the Media Specialist Kriszta
Zsiday (HU) and the Media Educator & Youth worker Sofia Moudiou (GR).  A team of music composers
from CodArts University (NL) will also join for the Production &
Performance days. But in order to financially support them, 
we need your
contribution! 

Evidently,
thereâ€™s a return-of-investment for your contribution measured in eternal
gratitude and valuable â€žgoodiesâ€.

These are exciting times for me, and this campaign is for the simple purpose of enabling me to print and frame my photos in order to hang them up in the gallery.

I need $300 (£180) for the prints. ASDA is my friend, but the 40x50cm prints push the price up.

I will put up as many pictures as I can afford by the end of the campaign.

<h3>Let me introduce myself....</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in California and have seen so much change to the amazing and diverse ecosystem so many call home. I studied biology, have a masters in art and have been involved in robotics for five years. This project combines my education, interests and passion into one kinetic, educational art piece.</p>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>TE+ND (Terrestrial Exploration + Nurture Designed) Rovers are an interactive art project that explores migratory ecology in an era of climate change. The rovers are robotic fostering environments that care for their own garden of native California plants by interacting with participants and actively seeking out light and water. Each rover is two feet wide by three feet tall and has a hydroponic growing station on top of a mechanically walking base. The hydroponic growing station is made of ceramic material and has been designed to retain the right amount of moisture for root survival. The goal of the project is to illustrate the plight of California’s native habitats, to disperse native plants in a new way, to encourage the general public to participate in conservation and to think about what is ‘native.’ </p>
<p>The rovers encourage the audience to assist the rovers by providing light, watering plants and helping the rovers to acquire the resources they need to keep their garden healthy. Because the robots navigate using obstacle avoidance technology, bystanders can “herd” them by standing in their way to cause them to move in a particular direction, and thereby encourage them to travel towards resources beyond the range of the robots’ sensors. In an urban setting, rovers will find water in sprinkler systems, drip irrigation, rain, fog, and from participants. In helping the rovers, participants learn about cultivating native California habitat and stretch the limits of human-robotic empathy and engagement.</p>
<div class=""im"">TE+ND Rovers, designed after space exploration vehicles, are intended to investigate a range of environments, from cityscapes to less urban locales. Primary locations for the first stage of deployment include Golden Gate Park, Mt. Diablo State Park, The Conservatory of Flowers and The Exploratorium.</div>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>When will they be built? How and where?</h3>
</div>
<p>The Rovers will be built during an artist residency at the Exploratorium, a San Francisco interactive museum of art, science and perception, during the month of June 2012. My team and I will work closely with Exploratorium engineers and staff in the final build stages and the first deployment of the TE+ND Rovers. The Exploratorium will provide fabrication equipment and knowledgeable staff to help with construction and logistics. As an interactive museum, The Exploratorium provides an ideal first deployment site. The residency comes with a grant from the James Irvine Foundation but your contributions are needed to enable us to complete the project.</p>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>Who can be a participant?</h3>
<p>Anyone! The Rovers are part of an interactive project intended for all ages. The TE+ND Rover project audience include anyone who encounters Rovers at a deployment site, including adults and children. Participants will be pedestrians, passers-by, hikers, bikers, joggers, picnickers, children at play, students and anyone who is curious.</p>
</div>
<p>The Rovers will also be used in schools and educational environments, helping students to explore ecology, biodiversity, evolution and plant biology. Students will learn about habitat encroachment and endangered species on the move, looking for habitat in which they can thrive. For deployments at schools, lesson plans from the TE+ND program will include handouts and guided discussions, encouraging students to observe, record what they find and to form conclusions about their experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>This sounds expensive! </h3>
<p>And it is! The wonderful part is that it's already half-funded by a grant from the James Irvine Foundation. The grant goes mostly to the Exploratorium for fabrication costs and being fabulous hosts. What we need to cover are the brains (Linux based ARM platform), eyes (optical sensors for the rovers to find water and avoid obstacles, ears (sonar for secondary obstacle avoidance systems), muscles (motors, gears, drive train to move the legs), food (batteries/solar panels and charger), bones (aluminum, Delrin, ABS spools), plants, ceramic materials and firing fees. All labor and R&amp;D is volunteer. We just need to afford the stuff to build them!</p>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<p>There are other ways to help out too. If you are interested in this project but are short on funds, don't worry! The Rovers can still use your help. Tell your friends, family, neighbors, students, drinking buddies, and co-workers about the project and make some noise! </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>My name is Britt Greenwood, and I am the founder of Tulsa Art Spot, <a href=""http://www.tulsaartspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tulsaartspot.com/</a> .  Tulsa Art Spot is Tulsa's only active art blog/website.  The site provides 100% FREE promotion for Tulsa area artists - visual and performing. In addition, Tulsa Art Spot also promotes local arts organizations as well.  It is my goal, through the website, to help up-and-coming artists recieve exposure and find opportunities while celebrating established artists as well.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to being the founder and adminstrator to Tulsa Art Spot and an artist myself, I am an Arts Advocacy Captain with Oklahomans for the Arts.  Being an Arts Advocacy Captain, (which is a volunteer position), for Tulsa, Creek, Osage, Rogers and Wagoner County means I am fighting for state, federal and private funding for art organizations which have lost over one million in revenue in the last 3 years; simaltaneously, I am creating a grassroots movement to engage citizens in art advocacy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I work many unpaid hours to help artists and art organizations because it is my passion.  I enjoy every moment of it and will not allow financial restraits to stop me.  This is why I need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Tulsa Art Spot will be:</p>
<p>1.  A resource for local area artists with marketing, advertising, tips, etc.</p>
<p>2.  A personal approach to journalism when interviewing artists and events at the location and in the studios</p>
<p>3.  Free publicity for organizations and venues holding art events</p>
<p>4.  A place people seek to find an artists through the online gallery and articles for commissions, projects, etc.</p>
<p>5.  A place people seek for local art events and articles of venues, organziations and events</p>
<p>6.  Bring awareness of Tulsa's thriving arts community</p>
<p>7.  A hub for arts advocacy awareness and advocacy opportunities</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the monetary goal is not met, it will mean missing out on art events and art interviews, which are the heart of the website/blog. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am willing to put in the unpaid hours of work and some financial burdern, but I am faced with costs that I frankly can not afford.  I am looking to fund Tulsa Art Spot for only 1 year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to attend 2 to 3 interviews, events or meetings a week, it will cost me at least $30 p/week in fuel.  Additionally, there are events which are not child friendly, and as the mother of two pre-schoolers would require child care and free sitters are not always available.  As in everything, there are miscellaneous fees and costs I will encounter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here, I have broke down the cost:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$30 per week in gas/$120 per month = $1,440 per year</p>
<p>Around 2-3 babysitters per month $80 =  $960 per year</p>
<p>Misc. costs: parking, cover charges, promotional material, website maintenance $50 per month= $600 per year</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total= $3000.00</p>
<p><br/>If the goal is not met, I will still attempt to do my best reporting and service to the Tulsa Arts but will be unable to make the impact many artists and organizations need. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the goal is exceeded, excess funds will go either to a Tulsa Art Spot art event, promotional costs or saved for 2013 expenses. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><em><strong>An image can show the power and nuances of who you are, and your experiences, if you are given the right tools to build it.</strong></em><br/><br/><em><strong>Wouldn't it be empowering to strengthen those image-making skills in the Arab and Muslim youth community?  Wouldn't it be possible by linking youth who may not have access to those tools with artists who use those skills all the time?</strong></em></strong></p>
<p><span>The Arab and Muslim community suffers from stereotyping; and part of the solution is to show- not only to tell-  who we are through the arts.</span></p>
<p>As an Egyptian American artist and arts educator, I know art can connect people by creating a space for their true voices. I've seen it happen in arts workshops I've facilitated for kids in underserved (labelled ""failing"") NYC public schools; refugee camps abroad; and summer arts programs.</p>
<p>I created RASMI (Arabic for <em>my drawing/official</em>) to provide a stimulating, structured, and free studio program where youth can create their own self portraits of identity through paint.

</div></div>","Short Summary
An image can show the power and nuances of who you are, and your experiences, if you are given the right tools to build it.Wouldn't it be empowering to strengthen those image-making skills in the Arab and Muslim youth community?  Wouldn't it be possible by linking youth who may not have access to those tools with artists who use those skills all the time?
The Arab and Muslim community suffers from stereotyping; and part of the solution is to show- not only to tell-  who we are through the arts.
As an Egyptian American artist and arts educator, I know art can connect people by creating a space for their true voices. I've seen it happen in arts workshops I've facilitated for kids in underserved (labelled ""failing"") NYC public schools; refugee camps abroad; and summer arts programs.
I created RASMI (Arabic for my drawing/official) to provide a stimulating, structured, and free studio program where youth can create their own self portraits of identity through paint. We will look at art from the Arab and Muslim world and its diasporas- from the streets to the museums- for inspiration. And we will end with a public exhibition in a local gallery.
The four week program will be hosted at the Arab American Association in Brooklyn and has been partly funded by the Brooklyn Arts Council. 
RASMI is a response to the lack of culturally relevant programming in classrooms about immigrant experience; a media saturated with stereotypes; and no clear network of artists who work with these local diaspora and immigrant communities. 
RASMI would not be possible without the seed of an idea, and all the visionaries who help make it grow. So please be part of our network. Donate any amount and/or spread the word.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In my various artistic explorations, I discovered Lumia as an art medium whose presence bespoke of a visceral light that created light images of a very evocative and narrative form. These visuals became a window to a fantastical vista of creatures, landscapes and abstract places whose spaces begged to be visited.</p>
<p>To share this magical light form, I have photographed a stunning collection of Lumia imagery that present a series of compelling Rorschach visuals whose lush metaphorical expression offers the beauty of refracted light as its own art form. The Lumia images will be publishd in a book known as <em>Sacred Destinations and Jouneys Along The Way</em>.</p>

<p>Although discovered in the 1920s, Lumia has, for the most part has been a lost art form, always in the shadow of other more powerful media formats. That shadow is fading and it is time for Lumia to once again grace the walls of art galleries, video screens and the printed page.</p>

<h3>The Filmmakers</h3>
<p>Emancipation is the brainchild of a young group of modern culture warriors, a hybrid of artists and modern day abolitionists.</p>
<p>Devin Hume directs a cast and crew of Colroado's finest actors and filmmakers interpreting a story by modern day abolitionist, Gualberto Garcia Jones.</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>""Emancipation"" is a story about friendship, sacrifice, and the intrinsic dignity of all people. <br/><br/>In the early 1860’s, Colorado was deeply divided across economic and social strata and people were enslaved not just because of their race. Our story is set in the very beginnings of the Gold Rush.  Small mining towns sprung up and started swelling. They were magnets for corrupt or violent fortune hunters from all walks of life that took advantage of ordinary people.  A tiny minority of the settlers were women; mining was men's work, so women were often left widowed, abandoned, abused or enslaved.  There was also a great deal of racial tension surrounding territorial disputes between recently settled Mexicans, local Indian tribes and white prospectors and ranchers.   <br/><br/>The difficult circumstances of the times afforded the perfect setting to explore what brings people down or raises them up when they are in trouble. In our story a bad situation builds till it bursts like an abscess. A split-second decision determines the outcome of our hero's life.  It is an uplifting story with a golden ending because the three friends ultimately choose life, at great cost.</p>
<h3><strong>Why should you invest in our little film?</strong></h3>
<p>Independent film is a difficult venture and those of us who know this project are witnesses to the dedication and sacrifice made by everyone involved. <br/><br/>Independent films rely on the good will and support of our friends and extended family.  We want to make the films that we want to see. <em>We want to make films that promote our values</em> and that serve as incubators for young talent in the film industry.</p>
<p>Most of all we want to make films that make people think without being didactic.  Likely this is why you are considering a donation to ""Emancipation.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will be shooting this fim in an old Western town located outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico.  John Wayne shot several films at this location and while it is a dream come true for art direction, including original period buildings, it will drive the cost of our production above what we have already raised. </p>
<p>We need $10,000 to reach our budget and make sure we can pay our extras (around 30), feed and house our crews (including horses and stuntsmen) and make this project a reality.</p>
<p>Shooting is scheduled to begin on Oct. 1 so we need to raise this money quickly!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Believe it or not, there are many Christian and Pro-life filmmakers waiting for their chance to shine.  What they need are good projects, with moral and artistic meat to sink their teeth into.  Emancipation is that project.  Your contribution to Emancipation the Film will help us elevate the kind of films we love to see; you know, those films we say, ""Hollywood should be making.""</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong>Strange Attractors</strong> is a 6' long x  4' high wall of blinking lights that simulates the behavior of individual fireflies in a large mass. In a natural landscape, fireflies' blinking will <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_synchronization"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">synchronize</a>. The blinking is effected by the level of light exposure. Participants can shine flashlights on the wall and get real-time feedback on how their outside influence impacts the fireflies' behavior.</p>

<p>The <strong>Foshaybuchet</strong> is a large model of the Foshay tower in trebuchet form. It will hurl illuminated objects across the night sky, creating an arc of light and a wall of blinking and glowing participatory art.</p>
<p>Our illuminated projectiles will be water balloons with a magnetic light inside called an LED throwie. We will teach people to make their own throwie balloons. Throughout the night the Foshaybuchet will fire them onto a magnetic wall, where they will accumulate to create a changing glowing work of art.</p>
<p>We are giving away 1,000 LED throwies to the general public.  Each particpant will get the chance to make a throwie to launch, and bring one home. Each person will pull the cord, and launch it at the large steel target on the Union Depot train deck.</p>
<p>One the really cool rewards that we are offereing is a Desktop Trebuchet kit!  Riley has spent countless hours creating laser cut trebuchets, and these will be an awesome reward for anyone who like seige engines.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you don't have the funds to donate, please considering sharing or bloging about our projects.  Any and all support will help this project!</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hack Factory of MN, 501(c)3
We are the Hack Factory, and we are launching a campaign to help fund our three projects that we are creating for Northern Spark 2013.  Northern Spark is an overnight art festival that starts at 8:58pm on June 8th 2013. 
Artists David Bryan, Riley Harrison, Cali Mastny, and Aaron Prust who are part of the Hack Factory have come together to create a hacker pavilion, if you will, at Northern Spark.  Launching throwies, mimicking nature, and welding sculpture in real time.
All of these projects are being designed, created, and backed by The Hack Factory, a 501c3 non-profit organization in the Seward neighborhood. Hack Factory of MN’s goal is have a collaborative shop space where people can come to work on projects, and foster an environment for learning, teaching, and making. The Hack Factory offers classes in diverse subjects such as electronics, woodworking, welding, etc.
The budget for this event and projects can be found in our Google Spreadsheet.
Project 1: Steel, Exquisite Corpse of

Contribute your vision to an evolving metal sculpture. Make a drawing and watch as artists weld it into 3-D form. Come back to see how the work changes over the course of the night.
And for the Exquisite Corpse of Steel project, we’re looking for inspiration for the first section of the sculpture related to the theme Underground (which will be followed by Above Ground, and Sky). Tweet @HackFactoryMN a drawing with the hashtags of #nspk38 and #underground. First 20 people to tweet us before June 8th with photos of their drawings will receive two LED throwies on the night of the event.
Project 2: Strange Attractors

Inspiration for Strange Attractors. Image credit: Alex Weber, http://www.flickr.com/people/8123185@N02/

Strange Attractors is a 6' long x  4' high wall of blinking lights that simulates the behavior of individual fireflies in a large mass. In a natural landscape, fireflies' blinking will synchronize. The blinking is effected by the level of light exposure. Participants can shine flashlights on the wall and get real-time feedback on how their outside influence impacts the fireflies' behavior.
Project 3: Siege Engines

The Foshaybuchet is a large model of the Foshay tower in trebuchet form. It will hurl illuminated objects across the night sky, creating an arc of light and a wall of blinking and glowing participatory art.
Our illuminated projectiles will be water balloons with a magnetic light inside called an LED throwie. We will teach people to make their own throwie balloons. Throughout the night the Foshaybuchet will fire them onto a magnetic wall, where they will accumulate to create a changing glowing work of art.
We are giving away 1,000 LED throwies to the general public.  Each particpant will get the chance to make a throwie to launch, and bring one home. Each person will pull the cord, and launch it at the large steel target on the Union Depot train deck.
One the really cool rewards that we are offereing is a Desktop Trebuchet kit!  Riley has spent countless hours creating laser cut trebuchets, and these will be an awesome reward for anyone who like seige engines.
Lastly, if you don't have the funds to donate, please considering sharing or bloging about our projects.  Any and all support will help this project!
Volunteer!
Also consider volunteering for the festival.  We need people to help make these things happen!  To signup for our projects, fill out this form.  To sign up with Northern Spark visit their volunteer page.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""Default""><strong>BIO:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><span>Antron Reshaud Olukayode, born Antron Reshaud Brown April 26th, 1984, has self-published three books; <em>Bohemian Rebel Naked and Exposed Vol.1, The Rising Vol.2 and Fearless Revolution Vol.3. </em>He’s made an appearance on CNN’s World AIDS Day 2008, written two stage plays entitled TRANS-ition, the journey of a teenager transitioning from male to female and the one man show EVICTED, about his years being homeless and HIV Positive to spread awareness of HIV/AIDS while mobilizing initiatives such as AID Atlanta’s <em>Evolution Project </em>and other community based organizations with similar missions to increase the betterment of young people nationally. Antron’s poem entitled <em>Passion Mark/HAART</em> was featured in the 2011 December issue of A&amp;U Magazine in correspondence to Museum of Design Atlanta’s <em>Talking Pictures</em>. He was also the first author to collaborate a book promotion with the Atlanta branch of the Microsoft Store. Olukayode is currently residing in Atlanta as a full time artist/entrepreneur and an contributing author for the upcoming collection of essays, short stories and poems by bestselling author Keith Boykin’s’ <em>“For Colored Boys Who Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Still Isn’t Enuf</em>.   Antron is a ten year survivor of HIV.</span></p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></p>
<p class=""Default""><strong>Book:</strong></p>
<p>The current release Ayo Lost and Found is a collection entailing the spiritual journey of my experiences as a young HIV positive African American male reflecting the sojourn of rediscovering the ample and striking beauty of joy.  When I began my soul searching I wasn't sure of my future's direction while enduring depression and feeling emotinally nil. The unhealthy cycle I continued to repeat was beginning to take a toll on my wholeperson. I didn't love myself and so I needed a drastic change and began re-examining my perceptions and beliefs about love, spirituality and re-invention. Let me also say this project was completely unplanned and because of that I believe in it ever more and have a deeper appreciation for the organic elements it brings. After growing discouraged from the attempts and results of previous projects I was giving up on Art altogether. Suddenly I found myself writing again. </p>
<p>The compliment of poems, proses and ruminations provide a self-analysis in which I found myself in a repressed state and began a search for clarification thus  undergoing the necessary changes to better myself individually and spiritually.</p>
<p>The book has now blossomed into an all-around artistic movement ranging from visual to performing artwork, Ayo has branched outside of the pages with a life of its own. Funding is imperative to carry out the mission to giving people my truth in hopes of someone benefiting from the mistakes, the triumphs and everything in between of my personal journey.</p>
<p>I am looking to create a small business to fund not only the supplying of distribution for this project but to also implement a continuum of taking ""Ayo"" to a brand new level along with producing upcoming projects. My overall goal is to kick start a series of book tours and other events and sell a thousand copies to start in which I intend to donate 30%  of the profits made to support a local art program for youth promoting change within their own communities. Funding is humbly requested for distribution, travel and promotions for the project. This campaign is important to me for Art has saved my life plenty of times and I pray I can give that gift to someone else. I want to inspire thoses who are willing to transform their mindsets and life. As a contributor, you will help me reach audiences in a way I never could do on my own. The vision I've been given is much bigger than myself. I would like to present a legacy that is meaningful and a celebration of the human spirit. </p>

<h3>The Reward of Giving</h3>
<p>The total funding for this project is 15,000 to start. This will allow me to access the proper channels of getting the project out there and keeping it consistently distributed, promoted and marketed. Travel expenses are also needed to speak in different cities nationally and internationally to spread the word. Funding will also be used to bring the small business BO's+ARO's ( BO means Beautiful One's, ARO are my intials) into fruition as the operating business or the umbrella of the ""AYO"" movement. For the visual I would need funding mainly for supplies, framing and having them delivered to different locations for art shows across the United States. The film and theatrical adaptation will be in need of cameras and other production expenses to bring this story to life. </p>
<p>In case the goal isn't reach I will use the funding that is earned to carry out this project the best way possible and keep my promise of donating 30% of the profits. This project is not about glorifying myself or making a name, it's a chance for me to create  and maintain new and familair connections through the work I create. I am taking a big step of faith to do this but I cant do it alone. I usually don't ask for outside help however it is impossible for me to properly execute this on-going project without it. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you will have perks as a thankyou for believing in me and my vision of creating togetherness and giving people the inspiration to begin loving themselves. From your contribution not only am I enabled to entirely focus on creating art in a comfortable and stress-free setting I can continue the work I've already began much more effectively. The book was written to pass along wisdom to someone as a way of simply letting them know life does go on and it doesn't always have to be in a bad light.

The Impact
As America prepares for the reincarnation of its hemp industry, we need to setup hemp fiber processing facilities. I believe that researching and working with hemp on a small scale will prove invaluable when it is time to establish large scale hemp paper production.
Hemp is much better for the environment than tree paper - Hemp cleans the air, earth, and water as it grows. It can be recycled 7-8 times and is archival!
Hemp does not require toxic chemicals for pulping, unlike timber which uses dioxins to remove lignins for pulping (which is a reason why the paper industry is one of the largest causes of water pollution on the planet.)
Hemp can be grown for seed and the stalk made into paper - a very efficient way to utilize precious farmland. Hemp also does not require much water and can grow very easily.
There are so many reasons to support hemp!
We are all connected - All One! Let's work together to heal the planet and create a sustainable new Earth for future generations.

<p>I am a working artist named Jen Berry. I believe connectivity with other people is a vital part of being human, it can offer encouragement when things are dark. My mission is to fight depression and isolation by providing art as a restoration of faith.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I began sending artwork through the mail, free of charge, to anyone who provided a street address. I have sent over 1500 pieces of art through the mail, to date. On occasion, I stand on corners, waving to commuting motorists and bikers, greeting them, and giving out art to cheer their day.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 500 requests to receive free art. Many in my community have donated time and materials to this project and I am very thankful for that support. However, the number of requests continues to grow and is exceeding my current ability to fulfill in a timely fashion. In order to continue this practice on what has become a large scale, I need to obtain an Oregon business license for Jen Berry Artitude in order take advantage of opportunities to better support this project, business cards, promotional stickers, paper and printer ink.</p>
<p><br/>All donors receive my eternal love and gratitude; I would not be here today without them. Smaller donations can expect to receive, a personal thank you card. Mid-level donations will receive a thank you card and the first run of a limited edition Artitude sticker. Larger donations will be sent a personal thank you card, an Artitude sticker and a special, one-of-a-kind original piece of art. If the goal is not met, all funds received will first be put toward materials necessary in order to print thank you cards for those who have donated supporting my mission.</p>
<p>Gifting art shows us all we are not alone in this world, human connection can soothe solitude, bring hope and reduce fear of the unknown. I believe action bearing love can change the world, I believe it can bring light to the dark corners.</p>

and corresponding Meet the Artists receptions



It is time to take The Jax to the next level. Our diverse users want the same things we do: imaginative ways and fun opportunities to access art, music, craft, and inspiration. The better our equipment, facilities, and personnel, the more we can include underserved people. We have done major work with several granting agencies to fund upcoming infrastructure improvements (a new education/multipurpose room; paved parking/driveway; improved ceramics studio). With your help, we will additionally acquire the necessary means to remain a truly community-oriented, egalitarian arts center in rural America, at both the concrete and virtual levels. With additional digital and realtime tools and equipment, as well as the space and talent to use them, we will evolve, broaden, and extend our services.Working in the old barn, last renovated in 2003, we lack basic resources. Our main gallery's environmental control and lighting systems are inefficient. We have outgrown our storage, administrative, and classroom spaces. We need a professional lighting system for our smaller performance venue; and a sound-proof audio/video work room (and upgraded equipment) to boost our marketing outreach. 
Finally, if we could “seed” the beginning of an endowment so we can build an investment in the future, the annual wintertime downturn in our programming cycle will not wreak its typical “doomsday” impact on our cash flow.Here’s what we need:


$20,000
digital education studio 
$5,000
staff training for digital studio management & ops

$15,000
stage & exhibit lighting & climate control systems 


$10,000 minimum for the
foundation of an endowment

 We expect to leverage your support as private match investment: a requirement to qualify for public (state and federal) grant funding. This means every dollar you invest in this campaign offers a potential doubling effect, through upcoming and pending grant applications.
Still, one of the most effective ways you can help is by simply spreading the word about rural Floyd’s Jax. Tell your friends that you’ve discovered us on Indiegogo! Tweet about us using #Jaxagogo. Remember: Sharing is Sexy!
Copy and send our Indie campaign link (shortlink = igg.me/at/FloydVAJax) to your friends! Our twitter handle: jax_art Use our hashtag #jaxagogoFind us on Facebook, too!Your donation will mean The Jax can strengthen the connections between 
makers and buyers; teachers and students; visitors and unique 
opportunities; children and art. 
Our public school elementary school children currently get only 1 hour of art in school per month. As
 we speak, Floyd’s public school representatives are trying to work with
 a $100K budget cut. What they’re considering is eliminating our last 
two public school art teachers’ jobs. With your help, we will have 
space for an expanded after-school program that makes a difference in 
our children’s lives (and the lives of their working parents, with no 
“home alone” scenario). 
Floyd is not populous enough to have a middle school—so our eighth 
graders attend Floyd County High School, and receive ZERO art 
instruction during their first year in the building. Creative education opportunities for youth = a critical component of the future and survival of Rural America's communities.
In exchange for your help, if you choose one of our perks, you will receive regional handmade art, craft, iconic Floyd-only items, or an opportunity for a unique escape to funky Floyd. All perks have been donated to us by supporters, artisans, businesses, advocates, and members. (We have a roll call of participating artists & businesses and their bios/contacts on our website. Check out Jaxagogo Friends – don't miss knowing more about the hands that made each item!) These stakeholders invest in The Jax through giving of their time, talent, and treasure every day. But many are “starving artists.” Investing in our campaign is a straight-line, direct way to support the hands that “make” Appalachia.
Even though there are many unique ""one-only"" perk items, we have a deep bench of one-only replacements in most investment categories. Come back often to see what has been taken, and what has been made available to say ""thank you"" to investors at each level. So many artisans have joined us to offer their talent and inspiration to you in return for helping us! Visit often and see what's next!We are proud to be among the catalysts for Floyd’s creative economy, and wish to expand that reputation and influence across a wider span of geography. Be a part of our growth and expand WITH us! Your contribution will be an investment in a piece of Rural America’s future.
Whether you choose to invest or not, one of the most effective ways you can help is by simply spreading the word about The Jax.

 we are creating an other-wordly art installation that fills a field 
with 500 enigmatic self-illuminated reeds. The field will come to life 
in light breezes, swaying dynamically, revealing the invisible wind 
patterns that whisper across them. In stronger winds, it will 
chaotically visualise gusts and squalls, making the invisible visible.</h4><h4>We'd like to install this large scale artwork at Nowhere 2015 and attempt to exhibit it around Europe until Nowhere 2016. </h4><div>
<h4> <br/>
</h4> <p>In 2012 Pete Johnson created an installation called The Shipping Forecast in response to the the high winds which are a common feature of the Nowhere site. The work consisted of 50 x 1.8 metre fibreglass stems with bright green LED spherical diffusers at the top.  It resembled a field of unearthly reeds which would stand serene and statuesque in still weather, sway gently in light breeze and sweep through wide, chaotic arcs in strong gales.  <br/></p>

<br/><p>Over the next couple of years the piece was expanded to 120 stems covering an area of approximately 480 sq metres in 2014.</p>
<p>For 2015 we will rebuild the installation with 500 stems, increase the height to 2.5 metres and add tech which will enable the spheres to glow green in still weather and become increasingly blue as the wind speed increases. This iteration will fill an area of 2000 sq metres and, hopefully, reveal wave formations resembling those found in large windblown grasslands. Spacially it will be the largest Nowhere art project to date. <br/></p>
<p>We estimate the total cost to be in the region of £3000. Nowhere Art has granted €700 (£515) towards the cost and we're now seeking £1000 to help realise this. </p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p><p><b><i>WHY AM I ASKING FOR HELP?</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>ANSWER 1 (too legit):</i></b></p>
<p><b>I’M A STARVING ARTIST, THAT’S WHY!!! </b> I’ve literally watched money go down the drain over the years, as I have showered off countless gallons of paint residue after my many performances!  </p><p><i>***side note:  I use non-toxic children’s washable tempera paint and spend extra for biodegradable plastic #GoGreen!*** </i> </p><p>PLUS, I am 100% ready for my true potential of success to be here.

<p>
</p><p><b><i>ANSWER 2 (the open heart):</i></b>  </p>
<p>Reminiscing over the past year I have been blessed with many wonderful opportunities to perform and show my art at some truly amazing events.  I am thankful for all the support I have received, the people I have met, connected with, inspired, and made smile.  I am forever grateful to those who have purchased my SPLITS ART paintings and prints and those who visualize doing so one day. I have been <b>performing out of my own pocket </b>because SPLITS ART is what I believe in and am passionate about!<b> <i>Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in your life!</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>ANSWER 3 (my dream is nearly my reality):  </i></b></p>
<p>I am teetering at that BIG BREAK point!  I know in my colorful heart of hearts that what I do is so very special and I am deserving of reaching my <b>BHAG</b> (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) where <b>my artwork is selling</b> next to the masters for its <b>true value </b>of <b>six figures and beyond!</b>  I see myself making my art a profitable career and creating a legacy; I have so many vibrant ideas to share with the world!   </p>
<p>
</p><p><b><i>ANSWER 4 (the big picture):</i></b></p>
<p>Those of you who have been a part of and/or watched my journey over the years have seen the growth, transformation and dedication to my <i>body </i>of work, <b>I wouldn’t be here without you!</b> <b> </b><i><b>I THANK YOU</b> <b>with all my heart!</b></i><b> </b> I desperately would love to <i>not only repay you,</i> but someday soon I intend to <i>hire</i> all my talented friends who have lent me their time, kindness and gifts of many forms because they see what I see in SPLITS ART.  <b>I dream of a winning future with <i>my SPLITS ART TEAM by my side! </i> </b></p>
<p>To those of you who are<b> new SPLITS ART fans</b> or just reading about me for the first time….First and most importantly, <b>THANK YOU</b> for spending your time on my page.  Second, I ask you, try to imagine what I have invested in time, effort and cost into each 5ft by 10ft painting <b><i>(AND of course, my practice paintings!!!  It is NOT easy to <b><i>choreograph and none the less </i></b>figure out how to paint a ginormous bumblebee, landing on a flower, in only 15 minutes, when you are upside down half the time, and the other half spinning around, trying to look cute and keep on smiling!)</i>. </b></p>
<p>Luckily, you don't have to imagine because here is the non-exaggerated answer: <b>it has been thousands upon thousands of self-invested dollars and years upon years to have reached this point in my artistic career.</b>  I am beyond excited to have this opportunity to share my art internationally and continue to inspire others to think outside of the coloring book lines of life.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>    </p>
<p><b><i>HOW MUCH HELP DO I NEED?</i></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Financially I’m would like to <b>manifest $15,000 USD</b> for this <b>Parisian experience</b>.  <b>Each artwork submission </b>at this exclusive event is €1.800,00 rounding to nearly <b>$2,500.00</b> <b>per painting </b>(there is a price break for the more paintings you send, apx $6700 for 3 paintings).  My paintings will be greatly cropped to fit within the exhibit requirements.  Ideally, I would like to have 3 pieces on display so it will appear as a triptych of a single artwork of my 'normal' proportions.  </p><p>In addition, I will need to cover the cost of my shipping/insurance on my artwork to and from Paris (likely the canvas will be shipped rolled-up to cut down on costs), reframing of the artwork in Paris, flight (apx $1200-1500), hotel stay (granted I will try to find someone to host my stay or budget it out in a hostel, but at max $200/night for 7-9 nights apx $1500 - $2000 ), local travel needs, a lesson or duex to brush up on my high school level 1 francais, and additional expenses such as shipping my SPLITS ART performance supplies for a TBD performance wink, wink, wink.   </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Gustave Eiffel Hall is so prestigious I will not be permitted to have a performance within the Eiffle Tower.  Yet, I will surely <i>bend over backwards</i> to find somewhere that will host a SPLITS ART performance.  It is a possibility to do an impromptu painting near the Eiffel Tower or more likely in front of the Louvre (as the following day after the show is the Salon Art Shopping 2014, au Carrousel de Louve Musee, talk about perfect timing!)! <i> <b>I would love to give the metallic miming robots a little friendly street performance competition!  </b></i></p>

</p><p>The <b>human connection </b>is the biggest way to share!  Please <b>talk about my story</b> and <b>share the links</b> via your email and social media outlets.  It is a small world out there and I know with your help we can get the word out.  Please help me find people to pitch in and I will be able to be part of this exhibit!  <i>This is truly an experience of a lifetime to be able to show my artwork inside the Eiffel Tower!</i></p>

Hello! Bonjour! My name is...excuse moi, ah-hem...Je m'applle Erin Barylski, but most people know me as my nom de plume, SPLITS ART.  SPLITS ART is my unique style of painting, where I use my entire body as my paintbrush! After years of dedication to stretching canvases and my body, I have been invited to show my art, at the “Gustave Eiffel Hall” inside the Eiffel Tower, Paris, France during the international show “La Grande Exposition Universelle”.

I am honored to show you a clipping from the invitation: 

“Dear Erin,

I want to invite you to participate at the most prestigious art event in the world: Exposition at the Eiffel Tower.

The most important artists in the world will be invited to participate at ""La Grande Exposition Universelle"" to be held inside the Eiffel Tower, “Gustave Eiffel” Hall.

!!!WOW!!!  That is some pretty amazing recognition, right?!

My dream is coming true to go down in Art History!  Considering it is the 21st century, doing something that is uniquely new was not an easy feat...but it is in my soul to expand upon the creative limitless possibilities in my performance art creations of SPLITS ART.  Growing up, even finger painting wasn’t vast nor freeing enough, especially with a smock on; now, I create larger than life artwork using only my limber body as my paintbrush. In efforts to keep this momentum going and having my BIG ARTISTIC BREAK, I am stretching out and asking for your support and financial help!  But first, let me take a moment to tell you a little more about SPLITS ART...


WHAT EXACTLY IS SPLITS ART?

My performance art, I have been told, is something you have to see to believe!  I use my flexible paint covered physique as a paintbrush, while performing choreographed and/or improvised dance, yoga, and contortion upon a canvas to entertain and create vibrant 2D artworks. My high energy talents and unique performance style have landed me on America’s Got Talent, The Late Show with David Letterman and at the world renown Art Basel in Miami, Florida 2013, and 2011.  I was most recently awarded Miami’s Best Performing Artist 2013 by RAWartists; was the headlining entertainer, with a full gallery show, at A Splash of Style, during the prestigious Miami Swimwear Week 2014; and I was the main entertainment at YELP’s 10 year Anniversary Party in Miami, 2014! My large scale artworks average 5ft x 10ft and have a variety of styles ranging from contemporary, impressionistic, logo’s and precise imagery; many performances are created at lightning fast speeds of 15-30 minutes and my more intricate pieces take hours!


WHY AM I ASKING FOR HELP?

ANSWER 1 (too legit):
I’M A STARVING ARTIST, THAT’S WHY!!!  I’ve literally watched money go down the drain over the years, as I have showered off countless gallons of paint residue after my many performances!  ***side note:  I use non-toxic children’s washable tempera paint and spend extra for biodegradable plastic #GoGreen!***  PLUS, I am 100% ready for my true potential of success to be here. I'm exhausted of praying to make it to my next paycheck from my 9 to 5,  in order to pay my bills and hopefully have enough money left to buy MORE paint… God forbid, I ever have  to use mustard AGAIN because I ran out of yellow paint( yes, true story, I smelled like a hotdog, it was awful).   S'il vous plait, do NOT pass the Grey Poupon.

ANSWER 2 (the open heart):  
Reminiscing over the past year I have been blessed with many wonderful opportunities to perform and show my art at some truly amazing events.  I am thankful for all the support I have received, the people I have met, connected with, inspired, and made smile.  I am forever grateful to those who have purchased my SPLITS ART paintings and prints and those who visualize doing so one day.

HOW MUCH HELP DO I NEED?

Financially I’m would like to manifest $15,000 USD for this Parisian experience.  Each artwork submission at this exclusive event is €1.800,00 rounding to nearly $2,500.00 per painting (there is a price break for the more paintings you send, apx $6700 for 3 paintings).  My paintings will be greatly cropped to fit within the exhibit requirements.  Ideally, I would like to have 3 pieces on display so it will appear as a triptych of a single artwork of my 'normal' proportions.  In addition, I will need to cover the cost of my shipping/insurance on my artwork to and from Paris (likely the canvas will be shipped rolled-up to cut down on costs), reframing of the artwork in Paris, flight (apx $1200-1500), hotel stay (granted I will try to find someone to host my stay or budget it out in a hostel, but at max $200/night for 7-9 nights apx $1500 - $2000 ), local travel needs, a lesson or duex to brush up on my high school level 1 francais, and additional expenses such as shipping my SPLITS ART performance supplies for a TBD performance wink, wink, wink.

WHAT IF I DON’T MAKE MY GOAL? (geeeze Debbie Downer!  Take a hike!)

Your donation will still be going to a great cause!  I will send my art, at minimum, one piece, even if I can’t send myself to Paris.  Getting my name out there in this international show is a true honor!

MAMI is an offering to Mami Wata, a pantheon of water deities that originates from West and Central African matriarchal spiritual systems. Commonly portrayed as a singular part-woman/part-aquatic creature, Mami Wata is called upon by those pursuing wealth, wisdom, emotional guidance, sexual liberation, and more. At once beautiful, jealous, generous, and unpredictable, Mami Wata is the embodiment of contradiction and hybridity. Informed by Mami Wata’s mystifying multiplicity, installations by Salome Asega, Nona Faustine, Doreen Garner, Aya Rodriguez-Izumi, MALAXA, and Rodan Tekle reflect on the process of discovering the Others within ourselves.


MAMI Programming
In addition to a series of installations that will transform Knockdown Center's arresting raw architecture, we have also programmed an exciting line-up of events that will keep you coming back to Knockdown Center:

Opening Party | August 6, 2016: Celebrate the opening of MAMI with exhibiting artists and curators, hosted by KUNQ, featuring DJ set by  SHYB0I. 
MAMI Market | August 13, 2016:  Spend the day at Knockdown Center supporting local designer and artist vendors, along with DJs, performances, workshops and more, co-curated by BALTI GURLS, Browntourage, Smart Girl Club, Top Rank Magazine, POWRPLNT, and more!
Performance Lecture | August 20, 2016: Multimedia artists Salome Asega and Dyani Douze join forces with world champion Floyd Little Double Dutch Team for a performance that incorporates light, sound, and of course, double dutch. 
Closing Party | September 3, 2016: Spend Labor Day Weekend at Knockdown Center for MAMI's closing party,  a day-to-night Caribbean-themed fete hosted by FAKE ACCENT. Featuring sets by an incredible line-up of womxn-identified DJs like Mursi Layne and TYGAPAW, and a live performance by Princess Nokia!


  


The Philosophy of 
  For
Us
By
Us
 and YOU

MAMI is an actualization of what we call the Philosophy of FUBU: For Us, By Us.
We have already received the invaluable support from Knockdown Center by way of access to their incredible space and funding for the execution of the visual art installations.

MAMI needs your support in order to be fully realized on the programming end. Together, we intend to support the cost of:
Installation materials 
Performing artist honorariums 
Equipment rental costs 
High-resolution documentation of MAMI installations and programming 

With your support, you are demonstrating your commitment to the work of dynamic early-career womxn-identified artists of African Descent who are shifting paradigms in the contemporary art world and beyond.
As a big hug to you for your support, we have a series of offerings that we are delighted to share with you, made with love by artists we admire. Some highlights include:

MAMI's Impact 



What MAMI Is Here For: MAMI is an intentional platform to present and support the work of early-career womxn artists of African descent. MAMI is an insistence that womxn of color are not a monolith, and that we can peacefully exist among our many subjectivities.  
What MAMI Isn't Here For: MAMI isn't yet another space to project respectability politics on womxn of color's identities, creative practices, and ways of being.
Risks & Challenges

 The artists are committed. The one-of-a kind venue is secured. The dates are confirmed. 
Our community is rich with people like YOU, who like us, are deep believers in the  Philosophy of FUBU. Together, we will manifest MAMI and make it an experience we will all cherish for years to come. 
There is no risk in believing in our collective power!
Other Ways to Show MAMI Love
 Every dollar and cent in the MAMI bank is a blessing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you're seeing this campaign, chances are you know us. You may be familiar with Sara from her prolific car-spotting Instagram account, or know Drew from her extensive documentation of the Richmond live music scene. Or maybe you've hung out with us IRL... you know, because we're related to you, or you're in a band with one of us, or something. </p>
<p>At the end of last summer, after a very trying time in both of our lives, which left both of us unsure of what was to come next, we discovered each other on OKCupid, of all places. Two days later, we met for tacos and Drew Barrymore movies, a first date which ended up lasting 18 hours. It wasn't long before we were madly in love. These days, we share a room, a teddy bear, and a <strike>whole bunch of pizza</strike> life together. Neither of us are rich, but we have big plans for our future, now that we've found each other.</p>
<p>The two of us share passions for many things, among them history, road trips, forgotten Americana, and automobiles of all shapes and sizes. Though initially inspired by necessity (more on that in a minute), a cross-country road trip would be our absolute dream honeymoon. This may be the only opportunity we have to do things like ascend Pike's Peak, explore the remnants of the legendary Route 66, and stand on a corner in Winslow, Arizona. We're trying to make the most of it.</p>
<p>At this point in our lives, neither of us has that much money to spare. But we do have a ton of creative energy at our disposal. We know we're in a position to need help funding our wedding/honeymoon, but the last thing we want to do is get something for nothing. Therefore, we're prepared to offer a variety of entertaining documentations of our trip to you as a token of our appreciation for your support. Hopefully they will keep you amused as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The initial idea for this trip came from our acquisition of a Jeep Cherokee that has, until now, belonged to Sara's dear friend Mark. Sara's a delivery driver, and currently logs around 180 miles a day driving her manual-transmission Volkswagen. Over the past few months, she's developed some severe pains in her right elbow from the constant shifting of gears. It's basically the delivery-driver version of tennis elbow. The Jeep would provide relief, due to its automatic transmission. Not only that, with her Volkswagen showing more wear by the day, a vehicle in more proper working order is going to be needed before too much longer.</p>
<p>So here's the thing: Mark moved to Seattle about six months ago. The Jeep is with him in the Pacific Northwest. If we're going to take delivery on it, we have to go to where it is. And around the same time this whole Jeep situation came up, the two of us decided that we were so in love, we never wanted to be apart. We'd been joking for months about getting married at the Taco Bell chapel in Vegas. Now, the opportunity was upon us to make that a reality, and join together forever under the auspices of the tacos that we love so much.</p>
<p>We've been saving up some cash for the past few months to make all of this happen, and so far, we've covered our airfare to Seattle. However, the trip home is going to require more funds than we can realistically come up with on our own in a reasonable time frame. (i.e. before the Hallmark busy season hits again and Drew can't leave town for more than two days at a time!) </p>
<p>We plan to do this trip on the cheap. To jam econo, as D. and Watt would say. We'll probably eat a whole lot of Taco Bell and cheap pizza slices, sleep in the cheapest rooms we can find, visit free and next-to-free tourist attractions, and spend most of our money on gas. We expect the trip to take 7 to 10 days, from when we fly out of Richmond to when we'll drive back into town. We have a place to stay while we're in Seattle (thanks Mark!), but once we depart, after a night or two, we'll be on our own. Ideally, we'd like to raise about $1800 to cover travel expenses and have some emergency funds in case of a breakdown.</p>
<p>We're going to give you something back for your contribution, though! Everyone who pledges a minimum of $5 will be subscribed to our trip-centric email newsletter, and those of you on Facebook will be added to a private Facebook group. The newsletter will go out at the end of each day (ideally), and will collect journal entries, photographs, and other various impressions of each leg of our trip. The facebook group may very well be updated multiple times an hour, if our social media habits are an accurate guide. Both should help you enjoy the journey with us, even if you can't be there to share our sketchy hotel rooms with us.</p>
<p>For those who contribute a minimum of $20, we'll be combining the best words and images from our trip into a publication we're informally calling ""Drew &amp; Sara's Wedding Album,"" which will be brought to you in the form of a black and white photocopied zine! This will help preserve our dorkiness in a more permanent form, since the internet will probably all be behind a Zuckerberg-controlled paywall in another five years or so. (Sara is skeptical of this claim.)</p>
<p>If you really want to pitch in and help out, we've got some more perks available for those with deeper pockets. For anyone who donates $50 or more, we'll not only provide all of the aforementioned rewards but also include a matched pair of mix CDs containing road trip playlists prepared by each of us. Drew's mix will no doubt feature the sort of detailed liner notes that she normally babbles excitedly into Sara's ear when they drive around listening to music. Sara makes no such grandiose promises, but the cover of her mix will be cool, and she's sure to introduce you to some stuff you've never heard before.</p>
<p>Finally, if you really wanna go nuts, kick down $100 or more and Sara and Drew will take you out for pizza. You'll have to either catch us at one of the stops on the trip or, more ideally, hang with us in Richmond after we're home and working again, but we pride ourselves on knowing where the best pizza can be found, so you're gonna eat well. And also, we like to think we're pretty fun to hang with. (Chances are, if you're willing to fork over $100, you think so too.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you're worried about us coming through, keep in mind that Drew has been cranking out a weekly internet column about live music for three or more years now, and has been producing physical zines semi-regularly since 1991 (when she was 15 years old). Also, Sara's photographic eye is impeccable, and she pretty much can't help taking tons of photos all the time. Finally, Drew does a lot better at meeting goals and staying on task with Sara around to support and encourage her, so chances are these two will push each other to get this done fast and well. After all, we're even more excited about this than you probably are!</p>
<p>We've outlined our ideal trip (shown in the cover image above), and we'd like to take the trip in the last half of August, in order to make it work best with our job schedules. If we aren't able to raise enough cash to make the ideal plan work, we may have to change our itinerary or timeframe slightly. However, this is a trip we pretty much have to make by the end of this summer, and I assure you we will be married by the time it's all said and done. There will be some form of trip, and some form of wedding, to document. And document it we will! But it's only with your support that we can do this in the awesomest manner possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that plenty of you are as broke as we are and are no more able to fund our wedding than we are. However, if you support what we're trying to do, you can still help! Share the link to this campaign on your social media if you are into lesbians taking cross-country Jeep trips. It'll be like Thelma And Louise, except instead of driving off a cliff at the end, we'll drive home to live happily ever after. </p>

<p><strong>We go through a lot to meet people today. I mean really</strong><br/><strong>meet people. It takes enormous efforts these days to make it past</strong><br/><strong>the filters of online dating profiles, text messages, hear-say and</strong><br/><strong>chance-meetings – to get to the point where we actually listen to</strong><br/><strong>one another and learn what we’re all about. I say, “enough!”</strong></p>
<h3>
<br/><em>Who Am I?</em>
</h3>
<p>My name is Leah Devora and I am  an artist who has worked in New York, L.A., San Francisco, Atlanta and Chicago with all types of media for over 20 years. I’ve painted with heavily textured oils &amp; acrylics … to tar &amp; roofing cement for sculpture … printed t-shirts and create usable art in the form of book covers, iPad cases &amp; hand bags as well.</p>
<p>You may have even seen some of my work and not known it on the sets of HBO’s <strong><em>Entourage, Six Feet Under</em> </strong>or <strong><em>West Wing</em></strong>. And if you are a moviegoer you can currently find my work papering the walls as murals for the growing <strong>iPic Movie Theater </strong>chain across the country. I’m always looking to grow and challenge myself as an artist – and that is what led me to <strong><em>The Dating Project – Voices</em></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em>The Process</em></h3>
<p>I have been recording men and women speaking about what they are looking for in a partner, their deal breakers, must haves ... their wants and desires. The goal is to create an art experience for people to actually hear what we are saying about ourselves and to each other from a whole new angle. Do we realized what we are putting out there about ourselves and others? Is our quest for the ""perfect mate"" realistic? Is it a fantasy? Is it absurd? Sometimes it’s best to rethink it to get those answers and attain better result.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><em>For Love &amp; Money – Where does your donation go?</em></h3>
<p><strong>•  10% of my funds will go towards charitable causes such as Free Arts For Abused Children and Bark Avenue Animal Rescue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>•  The art space rental – A significant amount will go</strong><br/><strong>toward this and the staff running it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>•  Sound equipment – Another chunk will be going</strong><br/><strong>towards buying speakers and microphones</strong></p>
<p><strong>•  Lighting – This is a crucial element to set the mood of</strong><br/><strong>each room (bulbs, stands and timers).</strong></p>
<p><strong>•  Computers &amp; Hard Drives – All of the recording is being</strong><br/><strong>done with Garageband on the Mac so there will be a</strong><br/><strong>need for multiple computers set up around the gallery.</strong><br/><strong>We have our personal Macs, but need more space</strong><br/><strong>and storage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>•  Promotion – A major promotional effort with an outside</strong><br/><strong>company is being put in motion for this project</strong><br/><strong>reaching out to lifestyle magazines, blogs, TV/cable</strong><br/><strong>interviews and more.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Ride the Wave!
We are a group of artists bringing awareness to ocean pollution by creating a giant wave sculpture at the 2012 Burning Man festival. 
Drawing our inspiration from the immense destruction of the Japanese Tsunami last year, and the inevitable onslaught of that debris arriving on the West Coast shore.
Take a walk along any beach anywhere in the world and you will see washed up an incredible range of debris. The oceans have been made a dumping ground for our waste.



 
What We Need & What You Get

We need to transport a lot of wood to the Black Rock Desert. We have multiple sources of drift lumber arriving from along the West Coast of North America.
LED lighting, and lots of it, that stuff ain't cheap!
All four of our incentives are custom, and very unique, we know you'll love em!


Our Breaking Wave sculpture is a participatory and an interactive project. Every person at Burning Man is encouraged to bring a piece of drift lumber from their local beach. 
The flotsam and jetsam collecting on our beaches reminds us that we are all connected – what happens on the other side of the ocean has an impact on us here on the West Coast.  Collecting drift lumber and burning it symbolizes our collective belonging to each other, and our transitory lives and relationships.


Statistics indicate that about 80 percent of ocean pollution is directly caused by humans.
Breaking Wave team members have a series of successful projects, between all of them, from building the man at local regional burns, to art shows curation, Decompression Event Production, even Non Profit board leadership. We have the skills to get the job done!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Petr, I'm from Czech Republic and I would like to explain what this project is about...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Story Of a Poster</h3>
<p>So one day I decided I want some nice poster in my home-office. After some browsing I wanted to design it by myself. I spent evenings learning how to combine fonts. What was clear from the begining was the message. I knew I want some Apple-related quote to hang on my wall.</p>
<p>Few weeks later...</p>
<p>Here is the final design! It's one size only (A3 - <span>29,7x42 cm or 11.69x16,54 inches) and available in black &amp; white and three bold colors. Prints will be made on quality paper and each one will be signed and dated on the back side. Every package includes personal thank you note just for you.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funds to print this beautiful poster on quality paper using offset print. The offset printing technology requires greater quantity but brings smooth and awesome quality of the final prints. You will see yourself when it gets delivered to your address  :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I prepared interesting perks just for you and I believe there is something interesting for everyone. Here you can see how the wallpapers look like:</p>

<h3>Flootie.com ""Kinda like a Dating Service for Art""</h3>
<p>The current world of art marketing is a jumbled up mess.  Galleries are closing left and right.  The term ""starving artist"" has taken on new meaning and private parties that wish to sell their artwork are having to wade through auction sites and lists only to get yard sale prices for their efforts.</p>

<li>As a contributor, you will have the satisfaction of seeing that there really is hope to selling artwork no matter what people say about ""the current economy"" (I personally hate that excuse).  You will also recieve super value subscription discounts as well as much sought after artwork gifts from artists Tom Hanson and Marcella Rose (you can see their works on <a href=""http://www.americanfineartcompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.americanfineartcompany.com</a> ).</li>

Alongside these proverbs are delightful short tales written by Jane Vejajiva, the S.E.A.Write award-winning author of, ""Happiness of Kati."" The exhibition received great interest by the public while the book became a best seller. Realizing that this is a worldwide phenomenon, the pursuit continues. Currently on tour in Singapore where a nation-wide event has begun with the original exhibition 'Thai Folk Wisdom ' set to debut at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts' New Asian Imagination Symposium. Followed by a 6 months campus road show intended to encourage on-campus cultural exchange to a deeper level and consequently activate an interest in proverbs amongst younger generations. All activities will culminate to a grand finale at Asian Civilization Museum that will include public workshops, forum of proverb experts from around the world and campus tours to view works on display on each campus. The waning of verbal tradition is a tragic phenomenon, luckily there is still time for a revival. It is my every intention to bring back the subject thus my global art and cultural crusade, ‘Wisdom Beyond Borders’ begins. THE IMPACTWisdom in its pure perception travels far beyond borders. With the unfolding of the crusade, we will begin to see striking similarities in principles, reason and knowledge across all countries the world over. Some proverbial wisdom varies only in imagery marked by the environment and surrounding as it crosses one terrain to another. Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill. -English ProverbRiding an elephant to catch a cricket. -Thai Proverb In a world that is discouraged by segregation, ‘Wisdom Beyond Borders’ unites people on the basis of expressions of truth, based on common sense and practical experience that has inspired these oral traditions.To ensure this is instilled in the minds of the next generations, we intercept students during their formative years with ‘Wisdom Beyond Borders’ workshop. Allowing them the chance to think critically on the subject of proverb and how such wisdom can be applied to their day to day life; approaching the matter with creative writing and more importantly artistic expression. That they are not merely words to memorize this workshop is intended to bring these words of wisdom to life - playing on words. Thus far, the dream of bringing this global campaign to life is half way to the tipping point. I humbly seek your support and patronage to take this crusade beyond borders, across continents and around the world as it should be an integral part to our future education.Social spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others that share the same interests and concerns. Therefore, developing www.wisdombeyondborders.org is the most viral and efficient approach to reach out to potential proverb aficionados in this crusade.  As Maria Montessouri once said, “If help and salvation are to come, they only come from the children, for the children are the makers of men.” WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETWe're looking to raise $20,000 to develop the website and mobile application, hire a full time editor a translator to ensure the site is well maintained and kept dynamic. Note. The site is intended to be self sustainable after the initial first year. Last but not least to hold a public workshop during Wisdom Beyond Borders, Singapore Grand Finale 2012. If we don't reach our entire goal, the ‘Wisdom Beyond Borders’ crusade will take a lifetime longer to accomplish. By then a generation of experts may also have vanished…. We're offering a wide range of perks, full of style and sass. Limited edition, so take a look at what we're offering while we are offering -for Indie GoGo pledges only! OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!If you'd like to see this become a reality as much as we do, but can't make a pledge (or already have); please feel free to share this with everyone you know! Spread the word via Facebook/Twitter/Blogs/News outlets or any other place that more people will find out about  ‘Wisdom Beyond Borders.’ This crusade can only be accomplished through your enthusiasm and support. Don't forget, Indie GoGo has some great ""share"" options right here on this page, so check them out and spread the word! With some luck, this fundraising will be a success then we will be seeing more of you at www.wisdombeyondborders.org!!! As an old English proverb goes, ‘A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.’ The future of proverb revival is in your hands!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Some Background:</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that the first ever National Poetry Slam (""NPS"") was held right here in the Bay Area? That was waaay back in 1990 and there were only 2 teams involved (SF &amp; Chicago). Since then things have changed; Both NPS and the spoken word poetry scene in the Bay have flourished. This summer 72 teams will head to Charlotte NC for The 2012 National Poetry Slam, among them is the first ever BayArea UNIFIED team.</p>
<p>That's right, for the first time ever, the four longstanding Poetry Slams from the Bay are combining forces and sending a single team to represent the entire area from SF &amp; the East Bay all the way to San Jose. The venues combining efforts to field this monster team are The SF Slam &amp; Experimental Mic; The Berkeley Poetry Slam; The Oakland Poetry Slam &amp; Open-Mic and San Jose's Oversocial MoFo Review. At the conclusion of the ""regular season"" the 24 winingest poets from across the Bay competed in one of four semi-finals from which the top 8 advanced on to the first ever UNIFIED Finals! There the team that will go on to represent YOU in Charlotte was picked.</p>
<p>The good news is we have a GREAT team! The bad news is while we raised a sizable chunk of the funds needed to get them to and through a week in Charlotte we need your help to close the gap. 100% of the funds raised in this campaign will go to funding team travel and lodging to and at NPS; the production of a team chapbook and DVD</p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>All told it'll take about $6,500 to register for Nationals, fly the team to Charlotte and house them while they're there. We'll also be self-publishing a collection of poetry and creating a DVD featuring performances from team members to aid in fundraising. If we need to hitchhike and crash on another team's floor while we're in N. Carolina we will. With your help though we'll meet our goal. Either way 100% of your donation will go to the expenses listed here. If we somehow manage to surpass our goal, the surplus will be divided among the team to be used as a per-diem while in NC.</p>
<p><strong>What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>YES - We have PERKS for you! A small donation will get you a chapbook with a (handwritten) poem from each team member and both coaches OR a chapbook from one of the team members. If you're able to be slightly more generous you'll recieve a copy of the DVD mentioned above, the team chapbook and one from each team member. If you're straight ballin and can afford a larger donation, in addition to all the items above we'll give you 2 lifetime passes to all our shows AND arrange a special feature performance by the team just for you!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>Tell you friends and help us spread the word! We're on facebook, google+, youtube, myspace, twitter and pretty much everyplace else you can think of online - check us out. If you know someone who's a fan of poetry (or comedy, theater and live performance in general) point them in our direction and earn a little good karma.</p>

<h3>30 Covers in 30 Days</h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is George Cotronis, and I've been a <strong>book designer and illustrator </strong>for close to 15 years now. Past clients include tabletop RPG companies like Evil Hat Games, Pelgrane Press, Cubicle 7, Renegade Games Studios and Stygian Fox, on projects such as<i> <a href=""http://site.pelgranepress.com/index.php/nights-black-agents/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Night's Black Agents</a>, <a href=""https://www.evilhat.com/home/dont-turn-your-back/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Don't Turn Your Back</a>, The Laundry Files RPG, <a href=""https://stygianfox.com/hudson-brand-inquiry-agents-of-the-obscure-coming-soon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hudson &amp; Brand</a></i> and more.

<p>In October of 2016 I came up with a little challenge of my own inspired by Inktober: <strong>Create a new book cover every day for a month.</strong> It sounded easy, but wasn't. I ran out of steam on about day 20 and stopped when it didn't feel like much fun any more.</p>
<p>I've decided to up the stakes and see if I could combine a challenge with a way to pre-sell some of my work to clients. One of the toughest parts of making a living as a freelance illustrator and designer is the uncertainty that comes with not knowing where your next paycheck will come from (and when!). It also hobbles creativity and your ability to take advantage of opportunities, being constantly cash poor. This is where my campaign comes in. On the off chance that I sold all 30 covers in this campaign, I'd be in a good position to plan future projects better, finally make some merchandise I've been working on and perhaps buy that overpriced Wacom drawing tablet. </p>

<br/><h3>A Little Bit of History...<br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Capital Slam was founded on 2004 in Ottawa as the very first Canadian National Slam Festival was coming to a close. Then called the Wordlympics, the renamed Canadian Festival of Spoken Word and Capital Slam both became very important pieces of poetic history in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Capital Slam became the centre of a burgeoning Spoken Word scene in Ottawa and has sent a team to represent the city at the National Festival every year since, including 2009 &amp; 2010 when the CapSlam team won the Championship in back-to-back years, against very tough competition<br/><br/>The festival was hosted in Ottawa in 2010 and the largest Slam Audience in festival history not only watched Capital Slam take home the title, but the second place team was ALSO representing an Ottawa series (Urban Legends), showing what a hotbed for amazing Spoken Word talent that Ottawa had become. Since then two different CapSlam reps have even gone on to win the WORLD Slam Championships in Paris!</p>
<p>As of this year, thirty different poets have represented Capital Slam at the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word and now five of them will be heading out to Victoria – the site of the first CapSlam National Championship win in 2009 – in order to remind the country that Ottawa poets have something to say.</p>

Capital Slam was founded on 2004 in Ottawa as the very first Canadian National Slam Festival was coming to a close. Then called the Wordlympics, the renamed Canadian Festival of Spoken Word and Capital Slam both became very important pieces of poetic history in Ottawa.
Capital Slam became the centre of a burgeoning Spoken Word scene in Ottawa and has sent a team to represent the city at the National Festival every year since, including 2009 & 2010 when the CapSlam team won the Championship in back-to-back years, against very tough competitionThe festival was hosted in Ottawa in 2010 and the largest Slam Audience in festival history not only watched Capital Slam take home the title, but the second place team was ALSO representing an Ottawa series (Urban Legends), showing what a hotbed for amazing Spoken Word talent that Ottawa had become. Since then two different CapSlam reps have even gone on to win the WORLD Slam Championships in Paris!
As of this year, thirty different poets have represented Capital Slam at the Canadian Festival of Spoken Word and now five of them will be heading out to Victoria – the site of the first CapSlam National Championship win in 2009 – in order to remind the country that Ottawa poets have something to say.


This Year's Team:


GAVIN RUSSELL – 2014 CapSlam Champ and TWO TIME Capital Slam team member.
CANDICE BRUCHHAEUSER – TWO TIME CapSlam finalist and first time team member.
ARTEMYSIA FRAGISKATOS – FIRST TIME CapSlam finalist and team member.
RUSTY PRISKE – SIX TIME CapSlam team member – including the 2009 Championship team.
AVONLEA FOTHERINGHAM – FIRST TIME CapSlam finalist and team member.
-
With a mix of veteran and rookie voices, the CapSlam team is set to make its mark.
Join us as we RAISE IT!

<h3>The Gaza Project</h3>
<p>I am a Mexican artist based in Switzerland with solo and group exhibitions in the past that include The Biennale International dell'Arte Contemporanea in Florence, The Economic Symposium in Churburg, South Tirol, The Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris, various collaborations with the Mexican Embassy in Bern, as well as exhibitions in other galleries, art fairs or institutions in Zurich, Basel, Mexico City and Buenos Aires among others.</p>
<p>Founder of the educational and peace building children's art project ""MAKE ART NOT WAR - Like Children Do"".</p>
<p>Art teacher, mother, language teacher and Buddhist meditation and yoga practitioner.</p>
<p>This is an important and unique project for me as an artist that is not only engaged with the creative mind and life with art but in our social and personal contributions to world issues, education, peace and understanding building among people of diferent backgrounds and cultures, specially when it comes to building new perspectives and new ways of thinking for the new generations.</p>
<p>With this first visit to Gaza I want to make an impact in the children I will be working with through art and creativity, motivating them to build their lives and perspectives around a positive input of life that will help them achieve their goals and dreams even in the restricted circumstances they live in at the moment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm doing this campaign to fund the trip as well as the things I will be bringing for the kids</h3>
<p>With your support I want to finance the trip as well as the printing of the books of both editions of my project to bring for the children in the school that have taken part in my children's art project and have their work printed in the book as selected work. I will as well bring the prizes for the children that won for the best works and some working material like color pencils or other creative material.</p>
<p>I am also very proud of having the opportunity to bring my own work for a joint exhibition with one of the renowned local artists in the Gallery Windows for Gaza which is a gallery founded by several local artists to make a window to the world and to Gaza through art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since I started my project ""MAKE ART NOT WAR - Like Children Do"" I was very aware that with it I would not ""change the world"" as we dream to do, but I was also always convinced that if I could make a positive impact to even one single children taking part in it, all of it would be already worth the world! In both editions until now I have had children of over 30 countries from all continents participating, including children from all over Europe, USA, Canada, Mexico, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Palestine, Israel, India, New Zealand and Australia among others.</p>
<p>I am completely convinced that with this visit to Gaza and working directly with the children as well as other people in the community I can bring them a highly positive impact from the world to them as well as motivation for the children to strive for their dreams and goals through creative means.</p>
<p>And I know they will as well have a huge impact in myself, in my life, and this will of course be reflected also in my work as an artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>People have told me I put myself at risk by going there but after much research and mainly by the trust I have in the many lovely people of Gaza I have had contact with for the past couple years, I know it all will be more than fine.</p>
<p>The two main challenges are, one, getting the permit from the Israeli government to go in, which some people tell me will be the hardest, but it is already in process and I am confident it will go through, and second, being able to finance the whole thing and make it happen, this is why I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Besides your financial support, you can also help me by sharing this with your friends, talking about it with people and/or groups or institutions that might be interested in helping. Also if you know anybody working at places that can make possible some sponsorship for art material I can bring to the children, this will be of big help.</p>

Cool technology, but it means that the resulting model is sensitive to UV light and will turn yellow over time, even when coated with a UV-protecting varnish (it slows down the process but doesn’t stop it).

Flipping the snowflake with a small artist’s paintbrush and photographing it with the same angle of reflection is not easy.

When I was searching for a person capable of modelling this in 3D, there were a number of false starts. Using websites with designers for hire was an initial mistake, and the resulting models were so poorly done I couldn’t even give feedback to start fixing them.</p><p>It was recommended that I check out Ian McKinnell and his work, specifically his detailed “x-ray” view of certain electronic gadgets, and I knew I found someone capable. There were still dozens of revisions based on the properties of the ice, everything from how ridges form with sharp edges to the concave nature of the center “gem” in the snowflake. Ridges, bubbles, cavities, they all went through some level of adjustment to get it to look and feel real to a trained eye.</p><p>The challenges continued when it came time to print this snowflake. Some of the bubbles inside the ice needed to be tattooed on the surface, and the overall model is likely thicker than the original snowflake due to production constraints. Countless conversations based on the available materials, and many visits to 3D printers before we decided on stereolithographic resin for the large model. We contacted more than 20 different printers that had this technology, and many of them flat-out refused to print it. Because the snowflake technically has detail on both sides, it can’t be printed flat. Some people stated that essentially “it can’t be done”.</p><p>It can be done, and a company in London is handling the large resin prints. Shapeways has the full capability to produce the smaller ornaments, with decent prices at or below the industry standard.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510702503/jqvwasuuqxuwp3oftw4f.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>But wait… tell us more about THIS snowflake!</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/donkom/24738291233/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(full image can be found here)</a></p><p>I thought you’d never ask. This snowflake has a few classic features that add extra beauty to these designs, starting in the very center. The hexagonal button-like gem in the center is what remains of a twin plate growing out of a center column connecting the two; this snowflake began its life as a column.</p><p>Column-type snowflakes usually form in slightly warmer weather, a few degrees below the freezing point. If the temperature drops while the crystal is still growing, it will shift into plate-like growth on either ends of the column. At this early stage, the two plates will likely be growing outward at an equal pace, but if a gust of wind or a pocket of higher humidity hits one side of the snowflake before the other, it gets more building blocks (water vapour) and grows a little faster.</p><p>At that point, the battle is over. As soon as one plate grows beyond the footprint of the other, the smaller plate has very little access to water vapour and will remain a tiny gem for the rest of the snowflake’s life. The larger plate will continue to grow outward, eventually growing branches, side-branches, and more unique features.</p><p>At the point where we see the first side-branches, the tip of the out-growing branch develops a small cavity. This happens when the top and bottom edge grow faster than the area inside the facet and it’s responsible for all the bubbles we see inside of snowflakes. If a cavity on the tip of a branch becomes larger, it’ll eventually split the top and bottom edges into new plates that compete for growth just like what happened in the center. The bottom-side won again, and you can even see a shadow in the original image that illustrates this shift</p><p>One of the side-branches doesn’t match the others, but showcases a very interesting phenomenon in snowflake growth. If a droplet of super-cooled water collides with the snowflake, it’ll freeze on impact (we see a lot of that along the outer edge, left off of the model, called “rime”). In one instance, this droplet protruded enough at exactly the right stage of growth to replace what would have been a normal side-branch. This branch is growing on a different plane, almost like it was just glued on top of the crystal. It also has its surface features on the opposite side of the crystal compared to everything else.</p><p>One side of a snowflake typically has surface detail, and the other is mostly void of any features except for some inward-growing lines caused by a thick outer edge growing back towards the center of a snowflake. In a split-crystal design, it’s very common for branches growing on different planes to have features on opposing sides, and we get a little hint of that here as well.</p><p>This snowflake has a lot of complexities, but is still has a very “classic” feel. That’s why it was chosen for the first snowflake ornament! Some features were left off such as a few hitchhiking small snowflakes and the rime on the outer edges, just to keep the core snowflake at the heart of the presentation.</p><p>I could go on, but let’s leave the rest for now. :)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you can’t contribute but love this project, it would be great if you could help in other ways!</p><p>Spread the word, most importantly!

For small production runs in silver, the cost is unfortunately very high, but the mark-up percentage is lower here to make it a little more appealing! Transparent Resin (the big one)Absolutely the best transparency, detail, and a great way to see detail inside the snowflake – bubbles in the ice are maintained in the model and visible from the outside. This is the first snowflake we prototyped, and it’s the most beautiful… but there’s a catch.Stereolithography 3D printing uses ultraviolet lasers to turn a liquid into a solid. Cool technology, but it means that the resulting model is sensitive to UV light and will turn yellow over time, even when coated with a UV-protecting varnish (it slows down the process but doesn’t stop it). This means the large and expensive model needs to be placed in a display case with museum-quality glass. There will be internal LED lights to illuminate it from the edges, but the extra expense for the enclosure pushes this much higher than the cost of the silver model. PlatinumReally? Sure, its crazy expensive and it wouldn’t be as detailed as the silver model, but if you want this thing in platinum I’ll make exactly one of them in this material. How’s that for limited edition?! Where are they made?These 3D printed ornaments are being created through the production house Shapeways, which I’ve had great success prototyping with. They have been flexible and very helpful in getting these models to work using a number of cutting-edge printing technologies.The larger transparent resin model is being produced by a smaller company in London UK. What happens if the funding goal is not met?Because these items are printed on demand, I can fulfill every order I receive even if the goal isn’t reached. If I cannot reach the funding goal than it becomes difficult pursuing this project farther and getting new models created in future years. Wouldn’t it be great to have your Christmas tree completely covered in real snowflakes? The ImpactYour contribution here will help further the research and design of new snowflakes in years to come, and hopefully allow for more extensive research of materials for future years as well. If the goal is met and exceeded, it’ll be far easier to spend the hundreds of hours this coming winter on presenting new snowflake images to the world. Risks & ChallengesMuch of the risk has already been absorbed – prototypes are now perfect and ready to be ordered… but it was not an easy road to get here.Firstly, this snowflake was photographed on both sides, the front and the back, in order to have a very clear view of the features. Flipping the snowflake with a small artist’s paintbrush and photographing it with the same angle of reflection is not easy. Having photographed thousands of snowflakes, it was at least possible.While I understand the topography of a snowflake very well, it only came after years of intensely studying them. When I was searching for a person capable of modelling this in 3D, there were a number of false starts. Using websites with designers for hire was an initial mistake, and the resulting models were so poorly done I couldn’t even give feedback to start fixing them.It was recommended that I check out Ian McKinnell and his work, specifically his detailed “x-ray” view of certain electronic gadgets, and I knew I found someone capable. There were still dozens of revisions based on the properties of the ice, everything from how ridges form with sharp edges to the concave nature of the center “gem” in the snowflake. Ridges, bubbles, cavities, they all went through some level of adjustment to get it to look and feel real to a trained eye.The challenges continued when it came time to print this snowflake. Some of the bubbles inside the ice needed to be tattooed on the surface, and the overall model is likely thicker than the original snowflake due to production constraints. Countless conversations based on the available materials, and many visits to 3D printers before we decided on stereolithographic resin for the large model. We contacted more than 20 different printers that had this technology, and many of them flat-out refused to print it. Because the snowflake technically has detail on both sides, it can’t be printed flat. Some people stated that essentially “it can’t be done”.It can be done, and a company in London is handling the large resin prints. Shapeways has the full capability to produce the smaller ornaments, with decent prices at or below the industry standard. But wait… tell us more about THIS snowflake!(full image can be found here)I thought you’d never ask. This snowflake has a few classic features that add extra beauty to these designs, starting in the very center. The hexagonal button-like gem in the center is what remains of a twin plate growing out of a center column connecting the two; this snowflake began its life as a column.Column-type snowflakes usually form in slightly warmer weather, a few degrees below the freezing point. If the temperature drops while the crystal is still growing, it will shift into plate-like growth on either ends of the column. At this early stage, the two plates will likely be growing outward at an equal pace, but if a gust of wind or a pocket of higher humidity hits one side of the snowflake before the other, it gets more building blocks (water vapour) and grows a little faster.At that point, the battle is over. As soon as one plate grows beyond the footprint of the other, the smaller plate has very little access to water vapour and will remain a tiny gem for the rest of the snowflake’s life. The larger plate will continue to grow outward, eventually growing branches, side-branches, and more unique features.At the point where we see the first side-branches, the tip of the out-growing branch develops a small cavity. This happens when the top and bottom edge grow faster than the area inside the facet and it’s responsible for all the bubbles we see inside of snowflakes. If a cavity on the tip of a branch becomes larger, it’ll eventually split the top and bottom edges into new plates that compete for growth just like what happened in the center. The bottom-side won again, and you can even see a shadow in the original image that illustrates this shiftOne of the side-branches doesn’t match the others, but showcases a very interesting phenomenon in snowflake growth. If a droplet of super-cooled water collides with the snowflake, it’ll freeze on impact (we see a lot of that along the outer edge, left off of the model, called “rime”). In one instance, this droplet protruded enough at exactly the right stage of growth to replace what would have been a normal side-branch. This branch is growing on a different plane, almost like it was just glued on top of the crystal. It also has its surface features on the opposite side of the crystal compared to everything else.One side of a snowflake typically has surface detail, and the other is mostly void of any features except for some inward-growing lines caused by a thick outer edge growing back towards the center of a snowflake. In a split-crystal design, it’s very common for branches growing on different planes to have features on opposing sides, and we get a little hint of that here as well.This snowflake has a lot of complexities, but is still has a very “classic” feel. That’s why it was chosen for the first snowflake ornament! Some features were left off such as a few hitchhiking small snowflakes and the rime on the outer edges, just to keep the core snowflake at the heart of the presentation.I could go on, but let’s leave the rest for now. :) Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute but love this project, it would be great if you could help in other ways!Spread the word, most importantly! The more people that see this page, the more trees will be adorned with larger-than-life snowflakes.Check out Sky Crystals, a book originally funded here on Indiegogo.

<p>Stairwell’s is a project started in 2011 by Bay Area artists Sarah Hotchkiss and Carey Lin. We organize site-specific exhibitions and lead group walking tours called Field Trips. We focus our programming outside of traditional gallery settings to create art experiences in unexpected places, like stairwells.</p>
<p>We need your help to increase the scope of our programming in our fifth year. If we reach this goal, we’ll mount our eighth exhibition, lead 3 new Field Trips and continue to reinvent what Stairwell’s is and can be.</p>

<p>My name is Dave, and I'm an artist.</p>
<p>The rough (ok, very rough) sketch you see above is of the Video Feedback Machine Sculpture I would like to build. The prototype I made to create the above video can be seen <a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3O4TgIkjjTo/UVfJfH2vccI/AAAAAAAAAag/9of1jKt6gTQ/s1600/feedback+machine+prototype.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Prototype"">here</a>. The prototype represents the functional part of the sculpture, but as you can cleary see, not the aesthetic part.</p>
<p>The prototype used a cheap standard definition camera and an old television set. The sculpture, however, will use a 4K camera and screen (that's quite a bit higher resolution than HD). The images produced with this setup will be spectacular (and never seen before).</p>
<p>The sculpture itself will be a combination of kinetic and performance art, a thing of beauty to look at and also to interact with. The sculpture will stand about twelve feet high and will be made of iron or aluminum and will be intended as an installation piece.</p>
<p>Below is a description of what is actually going on to make these images, and some philosophy to go with it:</p>
<p>This is old-school analog feedback. No computers were used (or injured) in the creation of these images. </p>
<p>The Video Feedback Machine allows the Operator to create a small universe in a plexiglass box.   </p>
<p>The plexiglass box contains a 4K camera pointed at a small 4K monitor that displays what the camera sees. This creates a video feedback loop.</p>
<p>You may have seen video feedback as wild spinning colors in '70s Hendrix videos.  But when the feedback is tightly controlled, as with the Feedback Machine, it can be quite sophisticated and intricate, creating beautiful morphing organic shapes found in nature.</p>
<p>This amount of extreme control comes from the camera's ability to move smoothly in relation to the monitor.  The Operator sits in the chair and uses something much like a yoke on an airplane to very smoothly move the camera forward, backwards, and 360 degrees around its axis. Small changes in degrees of rotation and distance create amazing changes in the feedback image.</p>
<p>On this yoke are control dials, among them: Brightness, Contrast, Color saturation and Tint.  These affect the monitor in the plexiglass box and allow even more control over the created image.</p>
<p>The image being created on the monitor in the plexiglass box is mirrored on the large 4K monitor, which is what the Operator (and others in the room) will be viewing.</p>
<p>I say this creates a small ""universe"" because the world we live in is a complex feedback loop.  All biological functions operate on a feedback loop and it is no wonder that the images created using video feedback are so organic looking.</p>
<p>Ecosystems, geological systems and social systems all operate on feedback loops, and they operate according to the inherent rules of that system.  </p>
<p>With the Feedback Machine, these rules, or laws of the universe, are the camera's angle, distance from the monitor and control dial positions.</p>
<p>But where does the image come from you might be thinking, and why does it actually exist?  It comes from itself, and exists only because it exists. Something worth pondering.</p>
<p>To me this must be what the brain is like. What I mean is, if some scientists, say from another planet, came in to the room where the feedback was being created, and tried to derive where it came from, they'd be at a loss. If they dissected the apparatus, the monitor, the camera, the wires, they'd find no clue to the origin of the pattern they saw on the screen. </p>
<p>This is like opening up the brain, poking around, and trying to find the mind or soul. These things grow through iterations, through cycles that start small and flourish, and can't be seen once they are gone (or the screen has gone blank).</p>
<p>Imagine a dark room where the camera is looking at a dark screen. It will stay dark this way forever (no life, no soul) until a ""spark of life"" (say the <a href=""http://vimeo.com/8597285"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Spark of Life"">lighting of a match</a>) brings forth an image, which will then perpetuate itself on and on. But, then imagine something blocking the camera's view of the screen, just for an instant. All of a sudden, the image goes out, never to return exactly as it was. To me, this is what the mind is, just a complex pattern.</p>
<p>So the question of ""where do you go when you die?"" is as meaningless as the question ""where does the feedback pattern go when it disappears?"" or, ""where does the snowflake pattern go when the snowflake melts?""</p>
<p>To complete the analogy, the Universe is the monitor, matter and energy are the image, and God is the camera, the all seeing eye in the sky. Or something like that.</p>

<p>The Transition stage company is the brain child of Natalie Yesufu . Born and raised in England she moved to New York in 2011 to pursue her dream of Acting and passion in film and theatre. Before moving to the United states: Natalie has a back ground in Event organizing. She has organized and produced events for the government and high-end events for charities. Natalie also produced and acted in her first feature film in 2010 ""Entwinement"". Natalie has been in New york for just little over a year and has produced a off broadway showcase which was near full capacity and has organized networking parties for actors and filmmakers alike and produced numerous projects in New York . Natalie believes Actors and Artists have so many obstacles  and it is imperative to work hard and of course have talent but be social and dynamic. This  is why she set up the Transition Stage Company to give this much needed support to the serious Artist.</p>
<p>THE PROJECT</p>
<p>The Gwen &amp; Gwen Art Installation play is a thought challenging experiment project which deals with topic of mental health with Women . The play Gwen and Gwen is a three act play by Nancy Kiefter and the event will run nightly for a week .</p>
<p>The play will take place in an art gallery/venue with a collaboration of other Artists exploring the themes of identity and mental health in society. There will be paintings and Art on the wall for your viewing pleasure and the possibility to buy. It will be an interesting evening with a free bar. The Artists will be confirmed throughout the campaign. </p>
<p>About the play:</p>
<p>Gwen has just been released from the home where she has been under psychiatric care and is trying to re-establish her life, her identity and her relationship with her estranged young children</p>
<p>After the social worker who has provided emotional support during the last year leaves her in a dingy apartment, a disturbing side of Gwen appears as a separate character .</p>
<p>In a tour de force for two actresses, Gwen’s alter ego torments and goads her toward self destruction. Spiced with dark humor, this psychological drama is a captivating evening of theatre.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>Mostly Gwen &amp; Gwen is an amazing play and can really give one an insight on the battles of people who suffering from mental illness . One in Four people suffer with this illness and you see many homeless people in New York battle with this plight. Natalie also lost a close relative due to mental health. She believes through a great theme, and  collaboration of Art it will bring great awareness and will be a new and exciting project which has rarely been seen In New York. It will be a great way of bringing awareness and also showing what Transition Stage company is all about. </div>

<p>THE CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>With this campaign, TSC is hoping to raise enough funds so that we can put on our very own first Art/Installation play . For most of us at TSC, this has been a dream for a very long time, but with the fight for space in this great city, prices are steep (as all you New Yorkers will know). We are hoping for enough money to hire a great space for a one week run. TSC would love for you to join us on this adventure, we really appreciate any donations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The money will also go to the development of the Transition stage company hosting website and branding .</p>
<p>Your contributions could really fulfill some long standing goals. The film and theatre industry is such a tough industry to break into, but the beauty of it is, that we can create our own art. We have to start small to get big. Your donations will really make a difference to size and scale of our production, and to the success of our future endeavors. We do not have the words to thank you enough. Any amount will help, no donation is to small.</p>

<p>Dear Friends &amp; Time Travelers:</p>
<p>LARGE OR SMALL - PLEASE DONATE TODAY!!!</p>
<p>DO NOT BE INFLUENCED BY OUR TOTAL FUNDING #'s AT ANY TIME. WE HAVE DESIGNED THIS PROJECT SO THAT IT CAN BE CREATED FOR $1 OR MORE THAN $25K (all that changes is how big and physically dynamic it will be.)</p>
<p>If we can not raise a large amount of funding, we will still produce a mind-blowing, heart-opening, consciousness exploring Guided Audio Journey &amp; Meditation that we can share with everyone!</p>

<h2><strong>Have you ever dreamed of traveling through time and space in a real Time Machine? We have! And now, with your help, we can manifest our dream and play it out together with the creation of the TIME MACHINE U.F.O. (Unusual Fantastic Object)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>A Little History . . .</strong></h3>
<p>Cosmic Cowboy aka Jonathan Yudis and Cyberius Rex aka Timothy Johnson first met in 1993 when attending NYU Film School.  While working together on film and TV projects they discovered a shared desire to also create transformational, interactive-art installations and a life-long friendship began.  When Cowboy was introduced to Burning Man in 1998 through another mutual friend, he was absolutely blown away and inspired to return in 1999 with Cyberius in tow to create the multi-media piece ""Hands Across the Man and the Psychedelic Torah"", which was simultaneously a participant-based art installation and event celebrating our collective 'unity in diversity', as well as, the basis for a documentary film project about the group of artists and adventurers on the journey to create this art project for Burning Man.  The joy experienced by putting our ideas out there and seeing what happened proved to be a powerful force and over the last 14 years our various projects have had profound impacts on those who participate and experience them, as well as, helping us to develop artistically and creatively which is, in and of itself, profoundly inspiring.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2004, Cowboy had a vision that we build a large-scale UFO (The Healing Mothership) inside of which participants could enter and experience a combination of lights, video projections, and sound that would create a transformational experience.  While intriguing, the motivation was just not specific enough to justify the cost of building something so elaborate and having personally funded all of our other projects, it proved too costly for us to manifest. Fast forward to 2012 and Cowboy had created a new Guided Audio Meditation track  (The first was actually the basis of The Living Coffin project executed in 2000) We tested this experience out on 65 people in our theme camp, Camp Mystic, to rave reviews.  Later that year, Cosmic Cowboy and Mr. Fun (aka Eric Gilliom) produced another Guided Audio Meditation track that we launched at the transformational event 'ReBirth 2012' in Maui, HI, again to rave reviews for the 100 or so participating.  We now had a truly inspirational reason to pursue an installation vessel in which to share this experience with as many Burning Man participants as possible day and night, throughout the week and the UFO concept was reborn.  In addition, when BMORG announced the 2013 Burning Man theme of Cargo Cult, complete with the Man perched atop a UFO-like circular tower, we knew the time had come to push hard to make The Time Machine UFO a reality and a spectacular, memorable Playa installation for the citizens of Black Rock City.</p>
<h3> <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">In contributing and supporting to this campaign, you are contributing to the proliferation of Love, Joy, Creativity, Radical Artistic expression, and the exploration of the ongoing evolution of human consciousness!</span>
</h3>
<p><em> </em>The primary distinction between 2004 and 2013 is the concept of crowdfunding. It is now entirely possible via this very Indiegogo campaign to reach out to and ask participants directly to help contribute financially to meeting our funding goal so we can afford to construct this installation.  If you are a Burning Man participant, you can look forward to interacting with this project and being dazzled by what it has to offer.  If you do not go to Burning Man, you can be inspired by a team of creatives exploring mind-altering, heart-opening, joy-producing experiences that we hope to bring to even larger audiences in the future, perhaps via theme park installations or a traveling venue you might see at concerts and festivals around the world. It's exciting to be a patron of the arts, especially those that challenge human beings into experiencing new and beautiful levels of being alive.</p>

<h2>
<em>""</em><em> </em><em>Today, we know that time travel need not be confined to myths, science fiction, Hollywood movies, or even speculation by theoretical physicists. Time travel is possible.""</em>
</h2>
<h2><em>- Clifford Pickover (Author: Time: A Travellers Guide)</em></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Time travel is the concept of moving between different points in time in a manner analogous to moving between different points in space. Time travel could hypothetically involve moving backward in time to a moment earlier than the starting point, or forward to the future of that point without the need for the traveler to experience the intervening period (at least not at the normal rate). Any technological device – whether fictional or hypothetical – that would be used to achieve time travel is commonly known as a time machine.</p>
<p>Though most common interpretations of time travel involve transporting ones self or ones corporal body within a physical machine or device through 3-dimensional space, mystics throughout the ages have spoken of a far more radical and dynamic form of time travel, that which involves transcending the ordinary limitations of time and space within the fabric of consciousness.</p>
<p>Utilizing sound technologies and binaural beats to balance brainwaves and the left and right hemispheres of the brain, the TMUFO is a vessel in which participants can lay down and relax the physical body and travel to various dimensions within the consciousness. These dimensions allow participants to journey into the past or the future and commune with beings and loved ones not in the physical body and ultimately arrive in the Eternal Now, or present moment.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are asking for $25,000 to make this project possible for the following reasons:</p>
<p>$10,000 - will purchase a re-usable 20' geodesic dome structure with a unique all weather 2-sided cover that will be the basis and home of our installation.  It will provide the practical shelter necessary for the Black Rock Desert environment of Burning Man and also begin the artistic and psychological representation of our flying-saucer experience.</p>
<p>$15,000 - will purchase: 1) Audio/Video Gear in the form of headphones, loudspeakers, and instructional video screen and playback equipment, 2) Lighting and Power in the form of LED strips and the necessary programming equipment, batteries, solar collectors and/or a gas generator, 3) Lumber and supplies that will make up the saucer-section around the dome and the relaxation platform inside, 4) Shipping/Transport/Storage for all of the components that will be pre-assembled in the beginning of August for reconstruction at Burning Man at the end of August and stored afterwards in Reno.</p>
<h3>You have perks!?!?  You don't say . . .</h3>
<p>$10 THANK YOU &amp; Welcome aboard courageous Time Traveler, your name will be printed and displayed upon the physical construction of the TMUFO and included in our initiation for cosmic exploration into consciousness.</p>

<p>$50 THANK YOU + All of the above plus recieve a healing quartz crystal that's been activated within the TMUFO and facilitated travel through multi-faceted dimensions of consciousness.</p>
<p>$100  THANK YOU + All of the above plus an 8""x10"" autographed portrait of the TMUFO on the playa at Black Rock City.</p>
<p>$250 THANK YOU + All of the above plus an invitation to the TMUFO Initiation and Launch Ceremony plus a custom designed TMUFO space suit (T-Shirt)!</p>
<p>$500 THANK YOU + All of the above plus a cosmic 2-hour tour of Black Rock City with (Cosmic Cowboy or Cyberius Rex) or both of us drawing on our unique 15 year perspective of the Incredible Burning Man Festival</p>
<p>$1,000 THANK YOU + All of the above plus a 3-hour tour of Black Rock City aboard the Peanutbutter &amp; Jelly Interactive Art Car</p>
<p>$5,000 - THANK YOU + All of the above plus you and 12 friends get a personal TMUFO journey and meditation with Cosmic Cowboy &amp; C-Rex at the controls.</p>
<p>$10,000 - THANK YOU + All of the above plus (for those attending the 2013 Burning Man Festival): a private introduction and audience with John Frum to hear his message for humanity; (and for those unable to attend the 2013 Burning Man Festival): a custom &amp; personalized Time Travel Audio Meditation designed specifically for YOU to facilitate your dreams coming true! </p>
<h3>What if, {GASP!!} we don't reach our goal!?!?</h3>
<p>Our devotion and dedication to creating this Time Machine UFO is total regardless of how much financing we can raise together. The financing and budget simply defines the level at which the project can be manifested and realized. If we do not reach our goal of $25,000, we are prepared to create either a smaller 16' version of the TMUFO or create a simpler, safe space for participants to experience the Guided Audio Meditations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why should I even care?</h3>
<p>If you are a Burning Man participant you are well aware of the many life-altering experiences you have likely had in Black Rock City.  As artists, Cosmic Cowboy and Cyberius Rex believe that contributing to this possibility is one of the most beautiful things about the community that exists at Burning Man and the experience of the Guided Audio Meditations is truly something that has the potentional to eventually enrich hundreds, to thousands, to millions of people's lives and we would love to see that happen.  In the same way that Burning Man is a beta test for humanity as a whole evolving, by sharing our UFO with Burning Man we are testing its impact and transformational power with those most open to experiencing it.</p>
<p>So far the few hundred people who have experienced these Guided Audio Meditations have reported back having an amazing experience that in some cases produced breakthroughs or life-altering realizations in healing or life purpose.  We can only hope to continue to make these GAM's more and more beneficial and the delivery system more and more satisfying and exciting.</p>
<p>Artists have always required the support of Patrons and we honor that age-old relationship by always using funding to produce at least some version of what we propose.  Whether you will be a direct participant this year at Burning Man or encounter us somewhere else in the future, you can take pleasure in knowing that you are supporting truth, beauty, love and the advancement of the human condition through entertaining and mind-expanding ideas and technology.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I don't have a lot of cash right now, but I'm excited to help . . .</h3>
</div>
<p>If you find that you are unable to contribute $1, $5, $10 or more dollars to our campaign, yet are inspired and excited about the idea please share this Indiegogo campaign with all of your friends, family, theme camps and beyond.  Don't forget that Indiegogo makes it easy for you to share this campaign via email, Facebook and other social media.</p>

If you are a Burning Man participant you are well aware of the many life-altering experiences you have likely had in Black Rock City.  As artists, Cosmic Cowboy and Cyberius Rex believe that contributing to this possibility is one of the most beautiful things about the community that exists at Burning Man and the experience of the Guided Audio Meditations is truly something that has the potentional to eventually enrich hundreds, to thousands, to millions of people's lives and we would love to see that happen.  In the same way that Burning Man is a beta test for humanity as a whole evolving, by sharing our UFO with Burning Man we are testing its impact and transformational power with those most open to experiencing it.
So far the few hundred people who have experienced these Guided Audio Meditations have reported back having an amazing experience that in some cases produced breakthroughs or life-altering realizations in healing or life purpose.  We can only hope to continue to make these GAM's more and more beneficial and the delivery system more and more satisfying and exciting.
Artists have always required the support of Patrons and we honor that age-old relationship by always using funding to produce at least some version of what we propose.  Whether you will be a direct participant this year at Burning Man or encounter us somewhere else in the future, you can take pleasure in knowing that you are supporting truth, beauty, love and the advancement of the human condition through entertaining and mind-expanding ideas and technology.


I don't have a lot of cash right now, but I'm excited to help . . .

If you find that you are unable to contribute $1, $5, $10 or more dollars to our campaign, yet are inspired and excited about the idea please share this Indiegogo campaign with all of your friends, family, theme camps and beyond.  Don't forget that Indiegogo makes it easy for you to share this campaign via email, Facebook and other social media.
 
Thank you in advance,
Sincerely,
Cosmic Cowboy & Cyberius Rex

<h3>Hey guys,</h3>
<p>My name is Ashlee, but most people call me Kira or Twisted Ribbon. I'm about to be 21 years old and have been living off and on in Albuquerque, New Mexico most of my life. I started drawing as a passion when I was 11 years old, though you could say I've been drawing since I could pick up a crayon. One night I happened across a anime called InuYasha and since that day I've been working on my own style, character design, and stories for all of my original characters, creating all kinds of them for different fandoms throughout the years. But now I've worked up the courage to take the next step and share my progress with you all.</p>
<p>This campaign will be to raise the funds to go to a convention in the next 2 months called Jackocon. It's there where I hope to get a booth to sell prints, stickers, and even commissions to local buyers or even to mail/ship products if you're unable to attend. Now, I need this all to come together because I've worked for over 10 years now trying to get the self-confidence to share my work with others but sadly, I'm not exactly rolling in money right now. </p>
<p>Anyone who is kind enough to donate will be helping me take the next step in achieving a life-long dream of becoming a accomplished artist as well as helping me come out of my shell a bit more as a person.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em; font-weight: normal;"">So in total I need about $900 dollars. I know the goal says $1000, so let me explain. For those who haven't used Indiegogo for a campaign, they take a percentage of what you donate if I get to my goal or not. If I reach my goal, they're still going to take about 4% of my total goal amount out of what you give to my cause, but rest assured, the extra money isn't going to be going into my own pocket. Any extra funds will be used to purchase more prints, stickers, or materials for the convention or any other conventions down the road.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>The first goal will be at $300 dollars, that will guarantee that I will have the booth for the convention and will be attending.</p>
<p>At $450, I'll be able to print 500 stickers to sell at the convention; I hope to have 10+ stickers to sell, with at least 50-100 of each available, depending on how close we get to the final goal of $1000.</p>
<p>And at the $900 goal, I will have 300 8 1/2x11 prints made as well as 30-50 11x17 prints made. Once again, the closer we get to the $1000 goal, the more prints and stickers will be available.</p>
<p>Now for the part that you've been waiting for: Prizes!</p>
<p>Now, a donation of $1 will get you a printable. Now that means any one of the stickers I will be selling at the convention is a choice as a printable picture that I will have printed on high gloss paper and will either mail to you or have available for pick-up at the convention itself.</p>
<p>A donation of $5 will get you a actual sticker of your choice, which is also available for pick-up or mail out.</p>
<p>$10 will get you a 8 1/2x11 print of your choosing, available for mail or pick-up which will be signed by yours truly. Did I mention it's a discounted price?!</p>
<p>$20 will get you a 11x17 print of your choosing, once again available for mail or pick-up, which will be signed, and it is also at a discounted price!</p>
<p>Now, donate $50 dollars and you will recieve a black and white commission with up to 2 characters printed on 8 1/2x11 semi-gloss paper.</p>
<p>And a $100 dollar donation will get you a full color commission with up to 2 characters, on either 8 1/2x11 or 11x17 semi-gloss paper.</p>
<p>All prizes will include a typed letter of thanks and appreciation from myself, and all are available for pick-up or mail depending on the donator's preference.</p>
<p>Now... If we happen to not reach our goal, I will provide the prizes to those who did donate, if need be, out of my own pocket or discuss alternate prize options if the problem should arise. All donations will go to the prints, stickers, and booth at the convention, though I may not be able to accommodate the entire amount stated above if we don't reach the goal.</p>
<p>Now, I understand that the economy isn't great right now. I know I'm not the only one struggling to make ends meet here, but if you can't donate and still want to help, please share my Indiegogo campain anywhere and everywhere you can. Every little share and donation counts.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your interest, I hope to have a video up within the week so I can connect on a deeper level than text on a screen.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hey guys,

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>The Winkler House is now under new management and we have a lot of catching up to do. </p>
<h3>What is The Winkler House?:</h3>
<p>The Winkler House is a two story building within walking distance to the <strong>U of L</strong> college campus, the <strong>Papa Johns Cardinal Stadium</strong> and the prestigious <strong>Churchill Downs</strong>. The building is currently owned by Framers Supply and now placed under our management. Framers has been a local business for 30+ years in Louisville and has lately been struggling in our weak economy.</p>
<p>Our plans for The Winkler House is to be the premiere hangout for Louisville KY and visiting artists and their fans. By art we mean all art. We want to host concerts, small theater shows, film viewings, mini conventions (film, Horror etc...), comedy/improv shows, art galleries, art classes, theater classes, family night, VHS movie night, birthday parties, monthly flea market, a place for film makers to build sets and shoot their films, special events (parties, PPV screenings, watch UofL games on the big screen etc...) and anything else we, or YOU, can think of.</p>
<p>Our ULTIMATE goal is to start a new coffee shop that would not only serve the students of U of L and the surrounding community but also focus on supporting the ARTS</p>
<p>We have a huge space that will be fully equipped to handle any and all events. We will have two fully furnished, fully functional apartments upstairs for visiting acts and/or for rent during local special events. Events such as Thunder over Louisville, The Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby, U of L sporting events etc...</p>
<p>In order to do all this, <strong>we need your help</strong>. Our first step is to keep the lights on. We've recently gained control of the building, as of last week, and unfortunately the building is behind on it's electric bill among other things. The electric will be shut off by the end of next week, Feb 22nd, which doesn't give us a lot of time!</p>
<p>As filmmakers, art is our life. We love all art and want to be able to show it off in all it's forms. With your help we can do that!</p>
<p>If all goes well, we would like to have a kick-off party during the month of April starting around Thunder over Louisville. We also plan to have a HUGE Derby Party during The Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby, just minutes away from our building!</p>
<h3>GOALS:</h3>
<p><strong>$1500</strong>: Our first goal is to reach <strong>$1500 by Friday February 22nd</strong>. This will keep our electric on and give us a month to try and get things in order. If all of our FACEBOOK FRIENDS donated just <strong>$1</strong> we would reach our entire goal in a matter of days! So instead of hitting the value menu at the local fast food restaurant one day this week you could donate that dollar instead to help SAVE THE ARTS and a 30 year old LOCAL BUSINESS! $1 goes a long way!</p>
<p><strong>About the $1500 goal: </strong>No money donated will be spent until we hit the $1500 goal. If we don't hit the $1500 mark by at least the end of February we will have to cancel this project and refund all money donated. This is due to the electric bill issue. If we do make the $1500 by the end of Feb we will continue as planned.</p>
<p><strong>$3500</strong>: Our second goal is to reach $3500 to help us start restoring the building. The apartments can use a major overhaul and the downstairs events area is going to need a lot of work.</p>
<p><strong>$5000</strong>: Reaching the $5000 mark will help us not only restore the inside of Winkler House but also it's exterior. We need a major cleaning and repainting on the outside as well as some foundation work. This is our main focus.</p>
<p><strong>$10,000</strong>: This would be a major goal. The Winkler House is in dire need of a new roof and QUICK. During any significant rainfall, our roof leaks as if it were Niagara. We have several kiddie pools in the attic catching the water now and they need constant bailing. A new roof is a must. For now we do what we can, when we can.</p>
<p><strong>$25,000</strong>: Would help us reach our ultimate goal of creating a local coffee shop, <strong>Tip O' The Cup</strong>, for the surrounding area. Especially the students of U of L. Not only would these funds help restore our building and save a local Louisville business of 30+ years but also help us support and serve the local college community and help save the arts in our area.</p>
<p>In addition to the coffee shop we would also like to help serve our community better by working with the local church and help those in need.</p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS TO HELP:</h3>
<p>We are not only looking for financial help but also volunteers and donations. Here are the things we could use, new or used, to help us restore our building:</p>
<p><strong>Paint</strong> (indoor and outdoor) any and all colors. We'll use what we can and donate what we cant.</p>
<p><strong>Furniture</strong>. All types. Couches, beds, tables, chairs, shelves, desks, etc... This will be both for the apartments and events area.</p>
<p><strong>Carpet. </strong>This is mostly for the apartments but could also be used in the event area.</p>
<p><strong>Lumber. </strong>To be used for numerous projects.</p>
<p><strong>Drywall. </strong>Also for numerous projects.</p>
<p>Bedding, appliances (fridge, freezers, stoves, dishwashers etc...), Televisions, electronics, linen (towels, blankets etc...), tile (for apartment bathrooms), kitchen cabinets, tools, sanders, curtains (and blinds), windows, doors, fencing, lighting and any other items you may think useful for such a project.</p>
<p>WE ARE OPEN TO IDEAS!</p>
<h3>Volunteers:</h3>
<p>We could use the expertise of Electricians, Carpenters, Painters, Plumbers, Roofers and Landscape among others. </p>
<p>When we say volunteer we mean for someone to come out and help us assess the building and what it would take to fix it properly. The money raised will be put into materials and ALSO help pay those that could help us fix what is broken. </p>
<h3>SHARE:</h3>
<p>Just by sharing this to your friends could help us tremendously. Like we say, if everyone of our friends would donate just $1 we would be well on our way to restoring this building and creating a place to showcase art in all it's forms.</p>
<p>We thank you for any and all support you can give and appreciate your time.</p>
