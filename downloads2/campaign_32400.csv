(but of course....no pressure!)In fact 75% of our budget is just for traveling... Once we get there the hard part is (almost)  over! But we can't wait too much! We will have to leave by the end of April, so the clock is ticking ... Can you hear it? (TICTOCTICTOC...)Thanks to our university we are able to get tickets at a fair price, but the more we wait, the more it is going to cost!! We are now looking for a place to stay and we are confident that through contacts and friends, we are going to find a place to sleep (don't worry we wont sleep in the streets....hopefully). If we don't reach our goal we have serious doubts that we are going to make it to Silicon Valley, but we are confident that is not going to happen. Want to help?With every donation you will receive this BEAUTIFUL and SUPER INNOVATIVE smartphone cover                ...Aren't you CURIOUS to know what's the secret of this MAGICAL cover?Find out what makes this Extra Verso cover so SPECIAL and UNIQUE  --> Extra VersoOf course the cover is available for ALL kind of smartphones...after the donation we will contact you in order to have better details for the delivery and for the type of smartphone that you have! But do NOT forget to....MAKE NOISE! ;) We want to be innovative, we want people to TALK about our project!! SHARE our website, our campaign, our FB page and our Twitter profile! EVERYTHING HELPS! Why us?We are going to Silicon Valley to study it. To understand it. To breathe it. We decided to focus on 4 MAIN TOPICS that are now becoming very influential for the future of people and businesses.These four topics are: 
BIG DATA: FROM HYPE TO OPERATIONAL REALITY
FASHION & INNOVATION


HOME AUTOMATION




THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION


For each one of these topics, our AIM is to study the recent trends, understand the technology behind them, talk with experts and learn as much as possible from them. We want to make you feel part of our project and it is exactly for this reason that we will SHARE our findings with all the people that will support us!Market researches, reports, summaries, conversations, conferences... We will try to SHARE as much as we can WITH YOU and we invite you to let us know how you want to be part of our experience.We HOPE to enable each one of you to become an Innovator, an Inventor, an Entrepreneur, or just to satisfy our same CURIOSITY about Silicon Valley and the magic that happens there everyday.Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Google Docs are the TOOLS that we are going to use to keep you updated. So do not worry, you will know everything at the same moment we do, because, in the end, YOU ARE THE ONE THAT MADE OUR DREAM COME TRUE!PLEASE.......if you have advice, feedback, critics or anything else, just drop us a message!

<h3><b>Our Program</b></h3>
<p>Teach for Palestine is located in the West Bank city of Nablus (visit us at: tfpnablus.wordpress.com). Inspired by an educational movement after the Second Intifada, our program aims to equip our students with the necessary skills to effectively access and contribute to their country and build a better life for themselves and their families. Our after-school program’s unique approach to English education is unmatched in the region. Our holistic, interactive approach has proven effective in mentoring students and developing fluency.  </p>
<p>Our average student acquires 350 new words and advances slightly more than one grade level in reading each semester. After their initial exposure to our international teachers, our students’ verbal fluency increases exponentially and continues to grow rapidly throughout the program. This also broadens their world view in a very positive way.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the classroom, our communicative and compassionate approach draws out and engages children who have suffered from violence, abuse, and oppression for the better part of their lives.  </p>
<p>We serve in the poorest neighborhoods, the Balata and New Askar refugee camps, and the villages around Nablus. In these areas unemployment is well over 80%. While our main focus is an engaging and safe environment for these students to learn English, we are also able to offer our brightest students scholarships to our partner school, Pioneers Baccalaureate School (<a href=""http://www.pioneers.ps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pioneers.ps</a>).</p>
<p>We are now operating in four community centers in and around Nablus. As we develop, we face numerous challenges due to location and funding. Providing our students and teachers with the necessary resources is not easy. Our hope is that you will help sponsor one of our classrooms.</p>
<h3>Salem Village</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Mr. Philip is teaching in Salem, a small village to the east of Nablus. Due to the high demand, we currently have five classes running, two beginners, two intermediate and one higher. Classes are mixed and the ages range from 6-14. We meet in the village community centre. </p>
<p>He is focusing on speaking, writing, reading and listening. He uses a variety of teaching methods and styles to engage the students, including music, games, activities and grouped work. The lower classes are working on basic greetings, vocabulary and phonic knowledge, while the higher groups are tackling comprehension and improving their spoken and written English. Teach for Palestine believes in total immersion classes, where the students learn to explain, express and communicate completely in English. </p>
<p>The semester has got off to a great start with topics on 'colour,' animals,' 'who are you?' and 'fly away' being covered already. With 'numbers,' 'my family' and 'Salem's got Talent' still to come, it's going to be an exciting couple of months!</p>
<p>We are a small organization and run on a very small budget. In the past, we have been solely funded by prominent leaders in the community. However, this is unsustainable and makes the expansion of our program unlikely. In order to grow our program, we are looking to establish more reliable funding channels.</p>
<p>Our project goal of $500 will cover the cost of classroom resources, including workbooks, paper, pencils, and markers, etc.; as well as, the monthly transportation stipend provided for our volunteer teaches. These resources are the bare minimum of what is needed to create a successful classroom. Our teachers are what make the difference. Our volunteers devote their time and energy to help make their classes engaging and fun with such limited resources.</p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our goal, we will still use the dedicated funds for classroom resources. Any amount that you can contribute will go towards this classroom, and we thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Taking the time to help any child in need is a valuable thing. However, by donating to this campaign you are putting much needed resources in the hands of our capable teachers and students who would not otherwise be able to afford it.</p>
<p>Our students seriously love learning. For some it is a chance to learn in a safe environment, and for others, it is a chance to truly better their own lives. With your one-time donation you will be paving the way for a successful classroom and become part of our students’ lives.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate at this time. We would also fully appreciate your help in spreading the word about our program and its mission. By sharing our story with people that you know can help, you are doing us a wonderful service. Cheers!</p>

Through our exploration of ‘original practices’ (practices thought to have been used by Shakespeare and his company) our touring abridgments focus on poetry and language. Without a set, costumes or planned blocking, each performance is a completely new experience that is built on the connection with each new audience and each new space. This exciting and engaging type of “guerrilla Shakespeare” is easily accessible for audiences of all ages, regardless of their experience with classical theatre. Our performances work to compliment the literary studies of English classes, helping students find new meaning and connection to classical text. The discussions allow students to ask questions, share</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.1px;""> </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.9px;"">their experience, and discuss how theatre can be thought about in new and exciting ways.</span></p>

First and Foremost,
Goal #1) Offer three free performances of our 40-minute abridgment of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet to inner city youth, followed by a discussion with the students. We have already scheduled performances with three schools: one in the Bronx, one in Harlem and one in Brooklyn. Through our exploration of ‘original practices’ (practices thought to have been used by Shakespeare and his company) our touring abridgments focus on poetry and language. Without a set, costumes or planned blocking, each performance is a completely new experience that is built on the connection with each new audience and each new space. This exciting and engaging type of “guerrilla Shakespeare” is easily accessible for audiences of all ages, regardless of their experience with classical theatre. Our performances work to compliment the literary studies of English classes, helping students find new meaning and connection to classical text. The discussions allow students to ask questions, share their experience, and discuss how theatre can be thought about in new and exciting ways.
Goal #2) Participate in theatre workshops with leading artists in the areas of community-based, site-specific, and experimental theatre—all of whom have interest in civic engagement. Already the Obie award-winning Peculiar Works Project has offered us a workshop!
Goal #3) Experience current, innovative NYC theatre and begin relationships with similar artists that have already met with success in order to most effectively shape the remainder of our studies to prepare us for successful careers that will make a difference in the world. 
We are looking to expand our skills by taking the work outside Illinois as we continue to explore the ways in which theatre can reach new audiences, engage communities, and incite change. We are at the point where testing our skills outside our home community will be a unique and important challenge. 
We hope you will make it possible to share the passion we have for this work with hundreds of children in New York City and support us in our pursuit to become artists that make a powerful, positive difference in our communities.


We have already secured funding for plane fare and free lodging in the city. However, in order to make this project possible with our very limited grad student budgets, we need your help to cover the workshop and incidental expenses that add up very quickly. Our $3,000 goal includes the Peculiar Works workshop, transportation to and from airports and within the city, student rush tickets and incidentals. Every contribution to our effort helps, whether it is $1 or $1,000.  Any donation will help us make the most of this opportunity. 
Already, our company has completed a successful tour of Shakespeare abridgments to local elementary, middle and high schools. We have created a devised theatre piece based on a “story circle” with ten Jewish and Arab teenagers from Israel. The project was so successful in helping the teenagers immediately relate to each other that the non-profit organizer of the trip, Friends Forever, is insisting that every group that comes to the U.S. participates in a similar workshop. Additionally, we conducted interviews with patients and staff at the Community Cancer Center and performed The Hope Monologues at the unveiling of its 'Wall of Hope,’ which received laudatory recognition from newspapers around the area:http://www.pantagraph.com/lifestyles/health-med-fit/wall-of-hope-uses-art-to-tell-stories-of-people/article_6885084c-8972-11e3-8848-001a4bcf887a.htmlhttp://stories.illinoisstate.edu/magazine/illinois-state/state-side/student-actors-embody-cancer-patients-hope-monologues/

<h1 style=""text-align: left;"">Student Vulcain Yengo Launches Power of a Dream Crowdfunding Campaign...to bring hope to  African...</h1>
<h2 style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Yengo hopes crowdfunding will give him the resources to create a documentary  in Congo. Last year he trained over 400 entrepreneurs who launched several businesses in Africa that are thriving and growing today.</span></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">..............................................................................................................................................</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Yengo grew up in the small town of Brazzaville located close to the river Congo in the Republic of Congo. Yengo's childhood was fraught with hunger and poverty. Though his parents worked hard to take care of their family of 11, the most they could make in any given day was a little under $2. This amount barely allowed for Yengo and his siblings to eat, let alone provide for other necessities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the age of 15, Yengo started his first business selling household lamp oil, cloths, and juice on the streets of Brazzaville. Though he worked hard at building his first business in the end it failed because of the continual rise in oil prices and the complexity of the business. Yengo recalls, “I think I had a heart for business, but I did not have a head for business yet.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now with his degree in Business Management, Yengo is striving to create a movement behind a new hybrid of African entrepreneurs – change makers with a mind for business. It is Yengo’s belief that entrepreneurship with heart will bring the real freedom that his continent is seeking.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Through his efforts Yengo hopes to inspire and empower a million Africans. He plans to do this through his documentary and by offering hands on training courses in entrepreneurism. Last year Yengo went back to the Republic of Congo to conduct seminars and a pilot program for his entrepreneurship training courses. The results from his seminars and program trained and impacted more than 400 people in different skill set and helped launch several African businesses that are thriving and growing today.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That trip and seeing the impact the training had on many successful Congolese entrepreneurs, he was inspired Yengo to create the ""Power of a Dream"" documentary. For example, Verone Mankou, is a 25 year old Congolese, who is the first African to create a tablet and a smart phone. “Verone amazed me because he was able to create something for our country that will have a significant impact in business and with fewer resources then most European and U.S. technology companies. He made history, but who knows about him?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Each entrepreneur Yengo met in Congo had a similar amazing story to tell. He saw how he could be a source of empowerment, hope, and confidence for many more Africans. Yengo wants to capture these stories in his documentary and freely make them available to anybody via the Internet. “I hope by creating The Power of a Dream and having it available to both Africans and the entire world that people will begin to understand that Africans need skills, and not just food and clothing.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Support Yengo’s dream by supporting his campaign on IndieGoGo.com or participating on his Facebook page. All proceeds go to creation of The Power of a Dream and helping African entrepreneur succeed.</p>

Student Vulcain Yengo Launches Power of a Dream Crowdfunding Campaign...to bring hope to  African...
Yengo hopes crowdfunding will give him the resources to create a documentary  in Congo. Last year he trained over 400 entrepreneurs who launched several businesses in Africa that are thriving and growing today.
..............................................................................................................................................
Yengo grew up in the small town of Brazzaville located close to the river Congo in the Republic of Congo. Yengo's childhood was fraught with hunger and poverty. Though his parents worked hard to take care of their family of 11, the most they could make in any given day was a little under $2. This amount barely allowed for Yengo and his siblings to eat, let alone provide for other necessities.
At the age of 15, Yengo started his first business selling household lamp oil, cloths, and juice on the streets of Brazzaville. Though he worked hard at building his first business in the end it failed because of the continual rise in oil prices and the complexity of the business. Yengo recalls, “I think I had a heart for business, but I did not have a head for business yet.”
Now with his degree in Business Management, Yengo is striving to create a movement behind a new hybrid of African entrepreneurs – change makers with a mind for business. It is Yengo’s belief that entrepreneurship with heart will bring the real freedom that his continent is seeking.
Through his efforts Yengo hopes to inspire and empower a million Africans. He plans to do this through his documentary and by offering hands on training courses in entrepreneurism. Last year Yengo went back to the Republic of Congo to conduct seminars and a pilot program for his entrepreneurship training courses. The results from his seminars and program trained and impacted more than 400 people in different skill set and helped launch several African businesses that are thriving and growing today.
That trip and seeing the impact the training had on many successful Congolese entrepreneurs, he was inspired Yengo to create the ""Power of a Dream"" documentary. For example, Verone Mankou, is a 25 year old Congolese, who is the first African to create a tablet and a smart phone. “Verone amazed me because he was able to create something for our country that will have a significant impact in business and with fewer resources then most European and U.S. technology companies.

Each entrepreneur Yengo met in Congo had a similar amazing story to tell. He saw how he could be a source of empowerment, hope, and confidence for many more Africans. Yengo wants to capture these stories in his documentary and freely make them available to anybody via the Internet. “I hope by creating The Power of a Dream and having it available to both Africans and the entire world that people will begin to understand that Africans need skills, and not just food and clothing.”

          AMAZING STORIES OF SUCCESS























I was empowered to create the ""Power of a Dream"" documentary after my trip in Congo last year (2012). For example, Verone Mankou, is a 25 year old Congolese, who is the first African to create a tablet and a smart phone. “Verone amazed me because he was able to create something for our country that will have a significant impact in business and with fewer resources then most European and U.S. technology companies. He made history, but who knows about him?”
Each entrepreneur Yengo met in Congo had a similar amazing story to tell. He saw how he could be a source of empowerment, hope, and confidence for many more Africans. Yengo wants to capture these stories in his documentary and freely make them available to anybody via the Internet. “I hope by creating The Power of a Dream and having it available to both Africans and the entire world that people will begin to understand that Africans need skills, and not just food and clothing.”
The Power of a Dream will be source of empowerment for Africans. Our goal is to publish the documentary at the beginning of next year and empower 1,000,000 Africans by the end of the year 2014. 
If everything is good and perfect in your life, do not underestimate the power of a documentary because there are so many people in African who live below $2 a day because they think they can't achieve anything.









You are the one who will help our team make this happen. This is not a request for donation to provide food to Africans, instead it is a call for your support so we can empower African to get out of poverty using their own brain and skills, and by following the example of other Africans.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>The Inaugural Black History Bowl is an academic competition providing high school students with a unique opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of African American History, compete for scholarships, engage in cultural enrichment activities, and build their self-confidence.  This year's inaugural event is focused exclusively on students of the high school age.  The day-long event plans to start with breakfast and/or include lunch, cultural enrichment activities and a concluding awards ceremony. The students are challeneged to learn all the information provided in our Black History packets. On the day of the event they will compete against eachother's knowledge of Black History with the hopes of winning scholarships.  The prospective venues for the event, the Boyde Vance Theatre (located in the George Washington Carver Museum and Multicultural Center) or the Millennium Youth Event Center, will allow the students and patrons of this event to experience a visit to one of Austin's most prized venues.</span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The purpose of this event is to engage Greater Austin youth in an academic competition in the subject area of African American's accomplishments so that they may be inspired and feed their minds of the rich history of their ancestors and the ancestors of their friends.  The Black History Bowl also gives young people in Austin the chance to grow intellectually, win scholarships (<em>should they win the competition</em>), and bring about positive change in our community. This is a grass root effort to offset the problems that get so much coverage every day, from low achievement scores to dropout rates.</p>
<p>The students who participate learn how important it is to study and experience positive peer competition. The latter translates into better relationships, an understanding of diverse backgrounds and lifestyles, and the importance of tolerance and respect for others.

<h3>KIPP Bayview Academy's Mission.</h3>
<p><span>The mission of KIPP Bayview Academy is to develop in the students of southeastern San Francisco the knowledge, critical thinking skills and character traits needed to succeed in top quality high schools and colleges, and to lead deliberate and productive lives.</span></p>
<h3>History.</h3>
<p>KIPP Bayview Academy is a tuition-free, college-preparatory, public middle school located in the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco. Since KIPP Bayview Academy opened its doors in 2003, it has consistently proven that with hard work and commitment, traditionally underserved students can achieve outstanding success.</p>
<h3>Values.</h3>
<p>Excellence | Initiative | Integrity | Positivity | Responsibility | Tenacity</p>
<h3>Enrollment and Demographics.</h3>
<p>255 students, grades 5–8</p>
<ul>
<li>90% from southeastern San Francisco</li>
<li>73% African American</li>
<li>16% Latino/Hispanic</li>
<li>9% Pacific Islander</li>
<li>2% Asian or other</li>
<li>81% qualify for federal free and reduced-price meals</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Kids and Teachers Are the Bomb!</h3>
<p>KIPP Bayview Academy students and teachers work tirelessly to accomplish our common goals of getting our students to and through college. Part of creating this amazing learning environemnt is working and learning in a nice space. We believe that our students and teachers deserve a beautiful place to spend their days! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We Need Your Help and Donations!</h3>
<p>Our school building has seen better days. We operate out of an old parochial school that has been around since 1955, with few repairs. The walls in the classrooms and hallways have chipped paint, uneven layers of old paint, and a color scheme that would make your head spin. This is not just about making things look pretty: we know our students learn better, and our teachers teach better when they are in a beautiful space. With your help, our students will take greater pride in their education, their community, and their school.</p>
<p>Your assistance will give our school a makeover, with a fresh coat of paint!  </p>
<p>We need a large, large, large (!) amount of money to professionally paint the inside of our school. This includes 2 long hallways, 10 classrooms, 4 bathrooms, the front office, and 1 library. The total price tag of this job is $60,000. </p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Project</span></strong></p>
<p>We are launching a Legal Fellowship Program this year to expand our work.</p>
<p>Through the Legal Fellowship Program, IYR will hire Tanzanians committed to public interest issues, then after a year of work, fund their legal certification. After they are newly minted as certified lawyers, IYR will offer them a spot to come and work for IYR for another year. This program will improve IYR’s capacity to provide direct legal aid and education by expanding our staff and our expertise.</p>
<p><strong>The Fellowship will help IYR improve three problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maasai widows often have their land and sometimes even their children illegally taken from them by their late husband’s relatives. The Tanzanian Constitution ensures equal rights for women. This Fellowship will allow IYR to assist more of these women in need and better protect their rights. </li>
<li>There is a dire lack of lawyers in Tanzania and in particular a lack of public interest lawyers working with the rural poor. This Fellowship will help educate a base of lawyers committed to public interest law.</li>
<li>Legal education is expensive. After getting a Bachelors in Laws, a prospective lawyer then must complete a one-year legal certification program only available in Dar es Salaam. Saving for the certification can take years. This Fellowship will provide funding for the certification program. </li>
</ul><p>Please check us out at <a href=""http://www.inherityourrights.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""IYR"">inherityourrights.org</a> for more information about our programs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Early meeting with the widows"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8WSfriCeSVQ/TmQ82F4H_YI/AAAAAAAAALU/6VD6UOvXi80/s720/widows%2520color.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Early meeting with the widows""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Fellowship Program Details</span></strong></p>
<p>Once we have raised the funds, we will select a Fellow who has recently completed their Bachelors of Laws from a local Tanzanian law school but who has not obtained their legal certification. The Fellow also must have a commitment to women’s rights in rural Tanzania. We hope to hire Maasai fellows.</p>
<p>The Fellowship Program will be three years:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first year the fellow will be employed at IYR on a salary.</li>
<li>The second year, IYR will then provide a loan for tuition and expenses for a certification program at the Dar es Salaam law school.</li>
<li>The third year, after finishing the certification program, the Fellow can come back to work for IYR, at a higher salary and to work off the school loan for one year or can work elsewhere and pay off the loan over the year.</li>
</ul><p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why Is This Important?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Protecting women’s rights</strong></p>
<p>In Tanzania, Maasai widows are vulnerable to abuse: when a man dies, his wife inherits nothing unless she is childless and there are no other relatives. The man’s children are the rightful heirs. However, if the children are too young to assert their rights, the man’s family often takes advantage of the situation and expels the widows from the land. These women, alone and with no means of supporting themselves or their children need both legal representation and practical assistance.</p>
<p>IYR will be able to assist more women in need with the additional help of the Fellow. IYR hopes this experience will be meaningful and that the Fellow will continue with such work beyond the Fellowship Program.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt=""Interviews"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ImtrQvegzRo/TmbXeXgoXgI/AAAAAAAAAJ4/op3BE-XMg6g/s640/CIMG3443.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Interviews""/></p>
<p><strong>Lawyer shortage</strong></p>
<p>Tanzania faces a severe lawyer shortage, and in particular has a shortage of lawyers working in rural Tanzania where the majority of people live. Tanzania only has about six lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants. Neighboring Kenya has three times that and the United States has over 300 lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The IYR Fellowship Program directly addresses this issue by helping add another lawyer to the workforce in Tanzania. And not just any lawyer – the Fellowship Program will select candidates based on their desire for public interest legal work in rural Tanzania, which will increase access to justice for the rural poor.</p>
<p><strong>The High Cost of Legal Education</strong></p>
<p>One reason there are too few public interest oriented lawyers working in rural Tanzania is the high cost of legal certification, in particular for students who live far from Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>In Tanzania, “law school” is a two-step process. First, you get your bachelors in law in a four-year university program. However to become a fully qualified laywer, you have to complete step two: a one-year certificate program at the University of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>The cost of attending the certificate program at the University of Dar es Salaam is a major problem for many would-be lawyers. It costs more than $3,500 in tuition, housing, and room and board. In a country with a per capita adjusted GDP of just $1,515, the cost of law school is overwhelming and prevents many qualified and interested students from attending, especially those not interested in corporate work. Interested students have to work for many years to build up enough money to be able to afford to get this certificate.</p>
<p>The Fellowship will turn what is often many years of saving and struggle into a faster, less stressful process.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Maasai Girls"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/9713_405388179530664_108650589_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Maasai Girls""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What Value Does This Fellowship Create?</span></strong></p>
<p>The benefit to Inherit Your Rights from this program is huge. Currently, we have three full-time staff. We also have a temporary full-time volunteer lawyer and anywhere from three to five volunteers who come to work for IYR for a two to three month period. We work every day to provide education on legal issues and support women in need of help, but we could do even more!</p>
<p>By hiring Fellows who speak Maasai and Swahili, we will be able to spend more time out in Maasailand giving lectures and educating the community. We will also be better able to provide legal aid – fighting for land rights locally, bringing cases to court, advising on legal rights, and drafting legal documents like wills and deeds to protect property rights.</p>
<p>In addition, we will have helped educate a lawyer committed to human rights and working to help the rural poor. Even after each fellowship has ended, we will have the benefit of knowing that we have a lifelong ally in the fight to empower women and protect their rights.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Perks</span></strong></p>
<p>In addition to the gifts listed on the right side of this page. Everyone who donates will receive an update about the fellows after they are hired.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/sSGRk.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perks""/></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Are Asking For</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>$9,000</strong></p>
<p>This covers everything to fully fund the first two years of the fellowship. Included are wages, tuition, expenses, everything.</p>
<p>IYR is a non-profit organization, so it doesn’t have the cash on-hand to fund a fellowship. That’s why we need your help. Please donate now to contribute to this important work.</p>
<p><span>Every dollar you donate will be generously matched by the Eagles Wings Foundation for one fellowship. If we surpass our goal, the surplus dollars will be used to fund an additional fellow and the third-year salary of returning fellows.</span> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is Inherit Your Rights?</span></strong></p>
<p>Inherit Your Rights seeks to educate, empower, and represent widows in Tanzania, concerning their property and inheritance rights. Our main goal is to empower widows to claim their property and inheritance rights, thereby strengthening their families and communities. We have initiated a pilot project in northern Tanzania, in a small village in the foothills of Mount Meru. Through a local Pastor, we have met and started working with a group of 35 widows. We have acquired a plot of land there, where we can operate micro-enterprise projects to assist the women with their immediate needs.

Our Project
We are launching a Legal Fellowship Program this year to expand our work.
Through the Legal Fellowship Program, IYR will hire Tanzanians committed to public interest issues, then after a year of work, fund their legal certification. After they are newly minted as certified lawyers, IYR will offer them a spot to come and work for IYR for another year. This program will improve IYR’s capacity to provide direct legal aid and education by expanding our staff and our expertise.
The Fellowship will help IYR improve three problems:

Maasai widows often have their land and sometimes even their children illegally taken from them by their late husband’s relatives. The Tanzanian Constitution ensures equal rights for women. This Fellowship will allow IYR to assist more of these women in need and better protect their rights. 
There is a dire lack of lawyers in Tanzania and in particular a lack of public interest lawyers working with the rural poor. This Fellowship will help educate a base of lawyers committed to public interest law.
Legal education is expensive. After getting a Bachelors in Laws, a prospective lawyer then must complete a one-year legal certification program only available in Dar es Salaam. Saving for the certification can take years. This Fellowship will provide funding for the certification program. 
Please check us out at inherityourrights.org for more information about our programs.
 

Fellowship Program Details
Once we have raised the funds, we will select a Fellow who has recently completed their Bachelors of Laws from a local Tanzanian law school but who has not obtained their legal certification. The Fellow also must have a commitment to women’s rights in rural Tanzania. We hope to hire Maasai fellows.
The Fellowship Program will be three years:

The first year the fellow will be employed at IYR on a salary.
The second year, IYR will then provide a loan for tuition and expenses for a certification program at the Dar es Salaam law school.
The third year, after finishing the certification program, the Fellow can come back to work for IYR, at a higher salary and to work off the school loan for one year or can work elsewhere and pay off the loan over the year.
Why Is This Important?
Protecting women’s rights
In Tanzania, Maasai widows are vulnerable to abuse: when a man dies, his wife inherits nothing unless she is childless and there are no other relatives. The man’s children are the rightful heirs. However, if the children are too young to assert their rights, the man’s family often takes advantage of the situation and expels the widows from the land. These women, alone and with no means of supporting themselves or their children need both legal representation and practical assistance.
IYR will be able to assist more women in need with the additional help of the Fellow. IYR hopes this experience will be meaningful and that the Fellow will continue with such work beyond the Fellowship Program.

Lawyer shortage
Tanzania faces a severe lawyer shortage, and in particular has a shortage of lawyers working in rural Tanzania where the majority of people live. Tanzania only has about six lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants. Neighboring Kenya has three times that and the United States has over 300 lawyers per 100,000 inhabitants.
The IYR Fellowship Program directly addresses this issue by helping add another lawyer to the workforce in Tanzania. And not just any lawyer – the Fellowship Program will select candidates based on their desire for public interest legal work in rural Tanzania, which will increase access to justice for the rural poor.
The High Cost of Legal Education
One reason there are too few public interest oriented lawyers working in rural Tanzania is the high cost of legal certification, in particular for students who live far from Dar es Salaam.
In Tanzania, “law school” is a two-step process. First, you get your bachelors in law in a four-year university program. However to become a fully qualified laywer, you have to complete step two: a one-year certificate program at the University of Dar es Salaam.
The cost of attending the certificate program at the University of Dar es Salaam is a major problem for many would-be lawyers. It costs more than $3,500 in tuition, housing, and room and board. In a country with a per capita adjusted GDP of just $1,515, the cost of law school is overwhelming and prevents many qualified and interested students from attending, especially those not interested in corporate work. Interested students have to work for many years to build up enough money to be able to afford to get this certificate.
The Fellowship will turn what is often many years of saving and struggle into a faster, less stressful process.

 
What Value Does This Fellowship Create?
The benefit to Inherit Your Rights from this program is huge. Currently, we have three full-time staff. We also have a temporary full-time volunteer lawyer and anywhere from three to five volunteers who come to work for IYR for a two to three month period. We work every day to provide education on legal issues and support women in need of help, but we could do even more!
By hiring Fellows who speak Maasai and Swahili, we will be able to spend more time out in Maasailand giving lectures and educating the community. We will also be better able to provide legal aid – fighting for land rights locally, bringing cases to court, advising on legal rights, and drafting legal documents like wills and deeds to protect property rights.
In addition, we will have helped educate a lawyer committed to human rights and working to help the rural poor. Even after each fellowship has ended, we will have the benefit of knowing that we have a lifelong ally in the fight to empower women and protect their rights.
Perks
In addition to the gifts listed on the right side of this page. Everyone who donates will receive an update about the fellows after they are hired.  

What We Are Asking For
$9,000
This covers everything to fully fund the first two years of the fellowship. Included are wages, tuition, expenses, everything.
IYR is a non-profit organization, so it doesn’t have the cash on-hand to fund a fellowship. That’s why we need your help. Please donate now to contribute to this important work.
Every dollar you donate will be generously matched by the Eagles Wings Foundation for one fellowship. If we surpass our goal, the surplus dollars will be used to fund an additional fellow and the third-year salary of returning fellows. 
What is Inherit Your Rights?
Inherit Your Rights seeks to educate, empower, and represent widows in Tanzania, concerning their property and inheritance rights. Our main goal is to empower widows to claim their property and inheritance rights, thereby strengthening their families and communities. We have initiated a pilot project in northern Tanzania, in a small village in the foothills of Mount Meru. Through a local Pastor, we have met and started working with a group of 35 widows. We have acquired a plot of land there, where we can operate micro-enterprise projects to assist the women with their immediate needs. We are also working with some other women who are making their own jewelry and wheat flour to earn an income for themselves.

</div></div>","Meet the first robot in the world that develops together with children. With Photon they can:  Children love to learn by experimenting. Acquiring logical thinking ability is the key to success in their future life. Playing with most of educational toys feels like a chore and gets boring quickly. And that’s why we decided to build Photon. STORYTELLING DRIVEN LEARNING ► Photon’s story motivates children to gain knowledge while keeping them engaged in a fun tale similar to popular comic books and cartoons.DAILY CHALLENGES ► The robot gives kids programming related challenges. After coding simple programs, Photon can perform hundreds of tasks and show living proof of how lines of code affect reality.FREEDOM OF CUSTOMIZATION ► Finishing challenges awards experience points known from RPG games. Children can use them to unlock new senses for the robot or boost his parameters according to their taste. No two robots will be the same!PAIRED MOBILE APP ► Photon is integrated with an intuitive child-friendly application for smartphones and tablets that lets kids interact with their robot and create their own programs.EASILY DIGESTIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ► The language used by Photon is based on colorful blocks and inspired by Scratch and Google Blockly. Even a 6 year old can master it in no time.  The robot develops along his owner by gaining new abilities, senses and functionalities with each programming related task completed. Completing a quest to create a simple program may let the kid pick some sort of upgrade for Photon, like the ability to see or detect obstacles. This way, progress is visible right away and works as wonderful motivational tool.It's not just another toy, it's a true friend and companion.    ► Coding - has become the most sought after skill of the 21st century.► Over the next ten years, programming will be one of the fastest growing occupations.► There will be 1.4 million programming jobs…► …and only 400 thousand graduates in computer science.►A computer science major can earn 40% more than the average college graduate . Unfortunately, few adults can program and even fewer can teach the skill.► Children highly benefit from learning about technology and understanding how it works. High technological literacy will become crucial for future generations.  Prominent people like Bill Gates or Barack Obama and corporations like Facebook are trying to inspire children and ignite their passion for coding.Our team wants to join these efforts and support the idea that every child should be a digital creator.We believe letting the younger generation learn about new technologies will allow them to succeed in their adult lives, professional careers and let them fulfill their dreams.The user communicates with Photon through the “Photon-Human Translator”® (a smartphone application). The robot presents a unique story with gradually harder challenges. All stories have been developed with the involvement of educators, psychologists, and game specialists. Thanks to 10 programmable sensors you can send Photon on specific missions like going through a maze while detecting obstacles or following a child's hand as Photon passes safely through a hazardous lava filled cave!
 
Step by step children encounter further challenges which teach them how modern technology works. They study the basics of programming as well as exercise their ability to think logically.
The application creates additional challenges designed in a manner that allows children to play together with their parents Children are able to proudly show off their problem solving skills to their moms and dads while parents get the opportunity to spend time with their children and support them. We want to help in building this relationship.

Finishing different tasks earns you points and allows progressing to the next level in Photon. Points may be used to further upgrade the robot, like unlocking new sensor functions, new ways to interact, and to personalize it according to your child’s preferences. No two robots will have the same set of features! That’s a first! After numerous trials and research with children, we know that it is an incredibly effective motivator.

Photon is equipped with a number of sensors which allow it to “feel” and interact with the surrounding world.

 
    Teaching programming takes place in steps of increasing difficulty. The application guides your child through the basics of programming and explains in detail how all the blocks that constitute programs work.  Children may program the robot using a tablet or a smartphone, through an intuitive visual block language, inspired by well-known and proven languages for children – Scratch from MIT and Blockly from Google. We’ve simplified the language to create a programing engine suitable for children (e.g. complicated settings or excessive/negative numbers have been removed). Additionally it has been adjusted to the capabilities of the robot and the mobile devices it works on. The only limit will be your child’s imagination.
   In the beginning Photon can’t do anything and is just your everyday plastic toy. That doesn’t last long though. Kids connect with him through the app, get acquainted and receive their first coding related missions. Each task completed gives them experience points which can be spent on robot’s development. They can for example:► Make Photon’s wheels faster, which lets him perform better at many endeavors ► Unlock his vision module allowing him to notice them, as well as get better at avoiding obstacles ► Make his eyes glow in a completely new color► Teach him to react to sounds and many moreEach new function and sense unlocked motivates them to experiment and gives a bigger set of tools usable in programming.   Just like a growing child, the robot gets smarter, stronger and keeps developing. RPG-like freedom of choice lets kids personalize their robots to their own tastes. Children are proud when their progress and successes in studying can be shown off and appreciated.    It is difficult to keep children stay focused and motivated. That’s why we worked together with experts in the fields of psychology and gamification to make playing with our robot as fun as possible. We’ve created an interactive story where the child and the robot are the main characters and have to work together. This builds a sense of responsibility which is a huge motivator and fosters learning.  Photon’s story encourages kids to take action and gain knowledge while having fun. When the robot was traveling to Earth, he had an accident and collided with an asteroid. His spacecraft broke into pieces that scattered all over the world. Now Photon wants to find these pieces, but he needs help from children! During their journey together they will meet many interesting characters that have found some of the spacecraft’s parts. These characters will present further challenges for Photon and the kids. Only if they pass a specific challenge, they will be allowed to pick up the missing piece.  All heroes of the story feel distinct and likeable. Their personalities are based on real human emotions like sadness, joy, anger, fear or curiosity. We’ve consulted the designs with a bunch of friendly kindergarteners and primary schools who had to approve every single one.     Photon has been created for children who are in elementary school. The system has been designed together with kids in order to perfectly fit their expectations, abilities and needs. After countless months of work and numerous prototypes, we’re happy to announce that children love playing with the final version of Photon.  We’re committed to assuring parents that they are giving their children a high quality and a well-designed tool that can help develop creativity, social skills and ignite interest in STEM(Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).   Children were a huge source of inspiration when it comes to design and ergonomics of our creation. Yes, they pointed us in the right direction and described what their dream robot should look like. The entire interface design process unfolded with a constant participation of parents, children, teachers, and psychologists. We have made every effort to make Photon safe, attractive as well as user-friendly. You can even add new accessories to change his appearance. A top hat? Maybe a stylish dress? The choice is yours! :)   Kids are creative by nature, and their ideas can be extremely surprising. That’s why we’ve created our robot with safety as a top priority. The robot is made out of durable and child-friendly materials. The internal electronics have been secured in a way that makes children unable to access them by any means.  Worrying about your favorite Bella, Duke, Sparky or other furry family member having a hard time, getting scared or too jealous of Photon? We have tested our robot with the help of dogs and cats and they seem to love it as much as kids. While learning to code with it might be a bit out of their reach, they still have heaps of fun. 
    One of the most interesting things we’ve noticed during the testing phase is the fact thatchildren aid and motivate each other while working with Photon. Cooperation and team-play are crucial for them and make the entire learning process much more engaging.  The robot teaches young people that they have to work together to overcome challenges. When one child has problems with a particular level, the other attempts to explain what he or she is doing wrong and how to do it better. Cooperating like this positively affects children, their development and social skills.   Children are adorably social creatures. With their robots being unique and personalized they love to show them off. When testing Photon at a friendly kindergarten we’ve noticed that they quickly came up with some funny competitions like races, obstacle courses and our favorite… sumo wrestling. That ensured us that creating a good multiplayer mode that could encourage positive rivalry is a must in Photon’s case.  Robots can communicate with each other, play games or fight, and use special moves.For example you can “cast a spell” and gain an advantage in a racing game - just like in the legendary Mario Kart (R) games! We plan to add leaderboards and daily challenges so that our beloved ones can compete with other children from around the world.    Our aim is to make the entire Photon experience enjoyable – from opening the box to setting it up and usage. The box itself looks like a spaceship and sets the stage for Photon’s journey. We want the magic of working with Photon to begin as soon as its little owner sees the mysterious package.   Everything made for kids should be as intuitive as possible. The smartphone app is based on visual hints to help the children that still lack a solid grasp on the alphabet get the most of it. . The coloring, shapes and patterns were also based on the research and analysis of our youngest specialists. 
    Our dream is to bring Photon to every child's house! To fulfill that dream we need your help. We appreciate all your support and hope we can do a lot of good for the world!    Photon was conceived in the minds of Martin Joka, Mike Grzes, Chris Dziemianczuk, Michael Bogucki and Mac Kopczynski, four students and one academic teacher from the Bialystok University of Technology, Poland. Now we're an international team consisting of engineers, programmers and developers from the USA (Chicago), Poland (Bialystok) and Belgium (Bruxelles).  Photon's creators have received numerous distinctions and honorable mentions for their work.

Together our fundraising efforts have helped support and grow our award winning science and arts programs, and these contributions have enriched the education of every child at Muscota. This year our parents have established a new goal of raising money so that all of our children can go on exciting and innovative field trips.Why we need your supportCurrently, when Muscota students participate in field trips we grapple with the limitations imposed by school buses;

we can only go to locations within the five boroughs


we cannot leave until 9:30 AM, but must return no later that 1:30 PM, leaving us very little time to learn and experience new things outside of the classroom.


We find that many truly wonderful field trip options are simply out of our price range.

How your donation will helpYour support will help us enrich the experience of every child at Muscota, by allowing us to hire private buses to take us on longer field trips and trips outside of city limits and enable us to go to places that were never previously accessible to us because of cost.Muscota PA is a 501c3 organization, so all donations are tax deductible. Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not every family will be able to make a financial contribution, but you can help by getting the word out to family and friends.Thank you for your consideration.

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #cc0000;"">My Story</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Ryan. I am the oldest of 3 children and a first generation college student. I am a senior at Texas Tech University from Houston, Tx. I'm acquiring my Bachelors degree in Advertising with a minor in Psychology. I have been a full time employee and full time student since the beginning of my college career in 2008. My parents and I have struggled tremendously to help put me through school. It has been an extremely hard and rigorous journey. Despite all of the trials, I have been able to stay on track with my 4 year degree plan, and will be graduating on May 19, 2012! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both of my parents attended college at my age, but both dropped out early on. My parents failure in their college career has always been their drive to push me to go above and beyond. They never wanted their mistakes to influence my choices in a negative way. They have been my backbone throughout my college journey the last 3 and half years, and everyday I strive to make them proud. My parents have always wanted the best for me and I've always wanted the best for myself. My family really didn't have the funds to finance my college career, and I wasn't ready for the big responsibility of taking care of myself at such an early age. From rent, to bills, to school finances, I have struggled each year to maintain my sanity in the mist of such a high work load. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My school is 10hrs. away from my home in Houston, Tx. And when things go wrong, I'm left alone. I have no family and no savings to help me when emergencies occur. For instance, in August of 2011, I was involved in a car accident where my car, which is my transportation to work and school, was wrecked pretty badly. It will cost $1450 just to fix it and its a very old car. I've been driving it despite not having a headlight and also having a cracked radiator. My car starts smoking on occasion and it has really limited me in making it to work and school. On top of auto failures, I have no groceries and hardly any clothing. Things have been very hard for me, but I persist because I can see the light at the end of the tunnel! My mom, always tells me that the struggles I go through today are only preparation for the success in my near future, and I believe that with every fiber of my being!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I am very excited to be graduating with a degree and finishing school, I'm stressing everyday to stay on top of finances for school tuition, loans, food, and other necessities. This last year of school has been the worse for me because my younger sister started her first semester of college and now the funds me and my family have are stretched even thinner. Sometimes my tuition doesn't get paid on time, and I can't even see my final grades until I've paid the amounts in full. I'm very fearful that I won't be able to pay my tuition off before graduation and then they won't let me cross the stage. I'm working 40hrs (plus overtime) a week at my job in the Lubbock,Tx, but that's not even enough to cover everything... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm not big on asking for help, but I heard about this opportunity and thought it would be a great chance to least try something when everything else has failed me. I would greatly appreciate any kind of contribution you can offer. Anything you can do to help will make the end of my senior year less stressful and more exciting. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>This Project will invite 30 motivated youth (ages 14-20) to a seminar to create an Issyk-Kul north shore volunteer network, which will provide these individuals with contacts and skills they can utilize to improve their communities.  After the seminar, the participants will be expected to create a youth volunteer committees in their own villages. In the spring, we will organize a follow-up conference, where the participants can share their success, next-steps, and work together to improve their approaches to community development.</p>
<p>Everyday we see the impact that youth can make in their community and we hope to strengthen that impact by providing leadership and management skills. Also we are encouraging partnerships between neighboring towns and villages. Experienced youth leaders will share their skills and can inspire other young people to make a difference.</p>
<h3>Background </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Kyrgyzstan is a small land-locked mountainous nation in Central Asia. Issyk-Kul is one of the 7 provinces of Kyrgyzstan.  During the soviet times, Lake Issyk-Kul was a premier destination for tourists.  Since that time, the infrastructure has started to crumble but economic activity still centers around tourism, which no longer provides economic stability for the locals in this oblast. </p>
<p>Unemployment is relatively low during the summer.  However, for 9 months out of the year unemployment can be as high as 60%.  The population of the north shore of Issyk-Kul is 61,000 and 31.5% of people live in poverty. </p>
<p>The schools in Kyrgyzstan lack after-school activities and there is no incentive for youth to be active in the community.  </p>
<p>As Peace Corps Volunteers living in different parts of Issyk-Kul Oblast in the Kyrgyz Republic, we are actively involved with youth development projects in our communities. We have reached over 3,000 children and young adults with projects ranging from simple English clubs to health lessons, and life-skills. Peace Corps is a grassroots organization, and after 2 years we are very familiar with the region, and are uniquely situated to help these communities.</p>
<p>A Peace Corps Volunteer works in country for only 2 years.  By getting students and young people involved in community development, our work will continue long after we leave.</p>
<h3>Our Project  </h3>
<p>The goal of our project is to provide youth the skills and knowlege to become leaders in their communities, begin their own volunteer committees, and engage their peers community based projects.</p>
<p>This project will fund a three day seminar for 30 students from 18 villages within a distance of 70 miles (114km). During the sessions participants will be taught project management skills, how to create work plans, how to assess community needs, and inspire each other to complete successful projects.</p>
<p>The funding will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation for youth participants</li>
<li>Hotel and meals</li>
<li>Printing training materials</li>
<li>Toolkit for implementation in villages</li>
<li>T-Shirts</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to have a follow-up conference in the spring in which youth can report back and discuss what has worked and what hasn't in their own villages, and to get help from eachother with future projects. If we do not reach our entire funding goal, we will only organize the initial seminar.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Added Impact</h3>
<p>In our initial impact we will provide skills and training to 30 motivated youth to spark them into taking action in their communities.</p>
<p>Additionally we hope that each of these conference participants will return to their village and inspire other youth to become active as well. We hope that by the follow-on seminar, our participants will have connected with a total at least 450 other youth encouraging them to be active.</p>
<p>Our overall goal is to get communities to join forces and invest in themselves, improving the quality of life for their residents. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Undocumented students are foreign nationals who either entered the United States without authorization, or entered legally but overstayed a visa without authorization. Like most young people whose parents force them to move, undocumented students rarely have any role in their decision to come to this country, or even to stay here. They are brought to this country by their parents or relatives. According to the 2000 census, over 2.5 million undocumented youth under the age of 18 were living in the United States.</p>
<p>Every year, 65,000 undocumented students graduate high school. But only 5% of these students go to college. While there are many factors at play in preventing low-income people of color from having access to a quality education, undocumented students face not only financial barriers, but the barrier of their status. Many do not see the purpose in applying to college when they do not believe that they will be able to utilize their degree for gainful employment.</p>
<p>Our campaign unites undocumented high school students with formerly or currently undocumented mentors that walk them through the college application process and trains undocumented students on becoming advocates for immigrant rights.</p>

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px;"">That's Nargiza in the blue sweatshirt!</span><br/></span></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Alyson and I just returned from Kyrgyzstan after two years as a Peace Corps volunteer. Maybe you've never heard of Kyrgyzstan (my mom still can't pronounce it after two years), but it's among the poorest countries in the world. I lived in a small village without running water, sporadic electricity and little heat during the harsh winters. Despite the difficult living conditions, I had an amazing experience, entirely thanks to my students.  </p>
<p>One student always stood out. I was fortunate to count Nargiza as both a student and host family member.  Though she did not live with my host family, she was somehow related and would often come over to watch my host sisters and other family members. I was always in awe of her ability to take care of at least 5 children, prepare all the meals, milk the cows, clean the house, do the laundry (by hand!)-always with a smile and without complaint.  </p>
<p>Though her kindness shone in the household, she really stood out in the classroom. When I arrived, it was easily apparent Nargiza was the school's best English  speaker. The Peace Corps volunteer before me, Bridgette, had worked diligently with all students, but it really showed with Nargiza.  Over the next two years, Nargiza took advantage of every opportunity to learn English. She came to English club everyday after school, attended English summer camps and participated in national English competitions. It was clear Nargiza had ambitions and dreams far beyond her tiny village in a country many have never heard of. </p>
<p>When <b>Mercersburg Summer Programs</b> graciously offered to waive the $6,100 tuition for one of my students from Kyrgyzstan, I knew it had to be Nargiza. Mercersburg Academy, a prestigious boarding school in my hometown, offers an array of summer programs and camps. One of the programs is an intensive 6-week English as a Second Language summer camp for international students. This program would mean a life-changing opportunity for Nargiza, .  </p>
<p>All we need now is funds for her airline ticket and visa/passport expenses. Nargiza once wrote in a classroom assignment: ""my dream is to come to America because there I can have bigger dreams than I could dream here.""</p>
<p>Here's a link to the summer program:</p>

<h3 style="""">The Impact</h3>
<div>Many students in developing countries cannot see the efficacy of English study.  In their towns or villages, English is rarely spoken.  In my own village, students would often tell me they would never need English, because they would be farmers or taxi drivers or teachers.  Many students could not see the opportunities available only to English speakers. <br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Nargiza's coming to America will be huge news.  Not only in my village, but in the many surrounding villages.  Students, parents and teachers will see the importance of not only English, but education. Nargiza will be an example of aiming higher and working hard, an example these villages desperately need. </p>
<p>And of course, the impact for Nargiza is immeasurable.  The program offers TOEFL preparation (the American universities' admission exam for speakers of a foreign language), visits to American college campuses, intensive English study and trips to various sites (New York City, Washington DC, Gettysburg etc...)  This is the beginning of great things for Nargiza!</p>

<p><strong>Ενισχύστε το Σχολείο Μεσογειακής Περμακουλτούρας στο αγρόκτημα της Νέας Γουινέας στη Νέα Μάκρη</strong></p>
<p>Σε αυτή τη γωνιά της Ανατολικής Μεσογείου, οι ιδιαιτερότητες του κλίματος και της τοπογραφίας, συνθέτουν μια σχεδόν μαγική εικόνα, δίνοντας στους ανθρώπους την αίσθηση πως είναι τυχεροί που ζουν εδώ. Όσο όμως και αν εκτιμούμε την άγρια φυσική ομορφιά και τις πλούσιες παραδόσεις του τόπου μας, δεν μπορούμε να παραβλέψουμε το γεγονός ότι στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος της χώρας, το φυσικό περιβάλλον έχει μετατραπεί πλέον σε ένα μωσαϊκό από υποβαθμισμένα οικοσυστήματα και ιδιαίτερα διαβρωμένα τοπία με αβαθή φτωχά εδάφη, που μπορούν πλέον να υποστηρίξουν μόνο μερικά ανθεκτικά είδη φυτών. Επαναλαμβανόμενες πυρκαγιές και λανθασμένες πολιτικές διαχείρισης των φυσικών πόρων επιταχύνουν περαιτέρω την ερημοποίηση, εγείροντας σε πολλές περιοχές ζητήματα επάρκειας νερού και επισιτιστικής ασφάλειας. Η κατάσταση αυτή αποτελεί την τοπική έκφανση ενός φαινομένου περιβαλλοντικής υποβάθμισης που εξελίσσεται σε παγκόσμια κλίμακα, με διαφορετική ένταση και ταχύτητα σε κάθε περιοχή, και αναδεικνύει την ανάγκη για τοπικές λύσεις, προσαρμοσμένες στις δυνατότητες και τις ιδιαιτερότητες των κατά τόπους κοινοτήτων και οικοσυστημάτων.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536390251/mn4mgtidkigo4wtlcucd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Καθώς το κλίμα μεταβάλλεται απρόβλεπτα, ο μόνος τρόπος να αποτρέψουμε τις επερχόμενες βαθιές οικολογικές κρίσεις και να διασφαλίσουμε τη επιβίωση και την ευημερία μας σε αυτό τον τόπο, είναι να κινητοποιηθούμε και να επιδιώξουμε την αναγέννηση των τοπικών οικοσυστημάτων και την επαναφορά τους σε μια φυσική κατάσταση ισορροπίας. Τώρα, περισσότερο από ποτέ, γεννιέται η ανάγκη να αναζητήσουμε τρόπους για να ενσωματώσουμε την ανθρώπινη δραστηριότητα στο φυσικό περιβάλλον με σεβασμό και συναίσθηση των ορίων που τίθενται από την ίδια τη φύση και να μετατρέψουμε την επίδραση μας σε ένα παράγοντα που θα προωθεί την πολυπλοκότητα και την ποικιλομορφία, ενισχύοντας έτσι την ανθεκτικότητα και την προσαρμοστικότητα των φυσικών οικοσυστημάτων, αλλά και των κοινοτήτων που υποστηρίζονται από αυτά.</p>

Ενισχύστε το Σχολείο Μεσογειακής Περμακουλτούρας στο αγρόκτημα της Νέας Γουινέας στη Νέα Μάκρη
Σε αυτή τη γωνιά της Ανατολικής Μεσογείου, οι ιδιαιτερότητες του κλίματος και της τοπογραφίας, συνθέτουν μια σχεδόν μαγική εικόνα, δίνοντας στους ανθρώπους την αίσθηση πως είναι τυχεροί που ζουν εδώ. Όσο όμως και αν εκτιμούμε την άγρια φυσική ομορφιά και τις πλούσιες παραδόσεις του τόπου μας, δεν μπορούμε να παραβλέψουμε το γεγονός ότι στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος της χώρας, το φυσικό περιβάλλον έχει μετατραπεί πλέον σε ένα μωσαϊκό από υποβαθμισμένα οικοσυστήματα και ιδιαίτερα διαβρωμένα τοπία με αβαθή φτωχά εδάφη, που μπορούν πλέον να υποστηρίξουν μόνο μερικά ανθεκτικά είδη φυτών. Επαναλαμβανόμενες πυρκαγιές και λανθασμένες πολιτικές διαχείρισης των φυσικών πόρων επιταχύνουν περαιτέρω την ερημοποίηση, εγείροντας σε πολλές περιοχές ζητήματα επάρκειας νερού και επισιτιστικής ασφάλειας. Η κατάσταση αυτή αποτελεί την τοπική έκφανση ενός φαινομένου περιβαλλοντικής υποβάθμισης που εξελίσσεται σε παγκόσμια κλίμακα, με διαφορετική ένταση και ταχύτητα σε κάθε περιοχή, και αναδεικνύει την ανάγκη για τοπικές λύσεις, προσαρμοσμένες στις δυνατότητες και τις ιδιαιτερότητες των κατά τόπους κοινοτήτων και οικοσυστημάτων.

Καθώς το κλίμα μεταβάλλεται απρόβλεπτα, ο μόνος τρόπος να αποτρέψουμε τις επερχόμενες βαθιές οικολογικές κρίσεις και να διασφαλίσουμε τη επιβίωση και την ευημερία μας σε αυτό τον τόπο, είναι να κινητοποιηθούμε και να επιδιώξουμε την αναγέννηση των τοπικών οικοσυστημάτων και την επαναφορά τους σε μια φυσική κατάσταση ισορροπίας.

<b>Prototypes</b>: Currently we do not have a fully functioning prototype. The photos in the campaign are engineered renderings of what we envision Brain Bit to look like. The Brain Bit system is based on existing speech recognition software and wearable technology capabilities.

Brain Bit is an enchanting, electronic device that allows families to measure your child's brain training by counting the words in their language environment. Brain Bit provides parents with real time feedback about how stimulating your child's environment is by glowing to indicate when you reach various language milestones throughout your day, in real time. 

                           

To track your brain training Brain Bit syncs with the app on your device so you can track and measure brain stimulation over time. 

                                                   
You and your family can set your own brain training goals or follow the ""daily recommended"" goals that are based on research. It's like Fitbit, but for your brain!  

       

You can wear Brain Bit as a wrist piece or as a pendant. 

                                

                           

You can now track your brain training the same way you track your physical fitness training.


How does Brain Bit do this? 
By leveraging sophisticated technology.

 Brain Bit technology available for ALL families.

                











Benefits for all, with a focus on the family.

<div>
<span>The purpose of a lighthouse is to guide and protect, and that is how we see our role. We will establish programs, events and activities that enlighten and affirm each child in a safe environment: we will encourage conversation to gain understanding of how each child is coping; we will provide counsel and support when needed; we will recruit and utilize experts to deal with life’s events and circumstances that could be particularly troublesome for our kids; we will generate activities that promote a positive self-image and, for the older youth, that encourage community service. Throughout all these activities, we will always nurture an environment of non-violence and caring towards self and others.</span>
<p>Now, Ben's Lighthouse wants to send 40 of Newtown's kids (aged 14-18) on a mission trip (through the Group Workcamps organization) to Oklahoma to work on the restoration of homes destroyed in the tornadoes.

<p>Greetings from Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia! My name is Zack Wiener, and I am an American teaching English under the auspice of the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program. I teach at Sekolah Kebangsaan Seberang Takir, a small primary school (years 4 - 12) in a fishing village outside of Kuala Terengganu, on the east coast of Malaysia. As a part of my job, I am committed to making English a living language for the students. In many cases, the Malaysian English language curriculum fails to instill a sense of vibrancy that the language has to offer. I seek to get students excited about speaking English through the use of media in the classroom. Primarily, I try my best to expose students to people around the world speaking English, whether through YouTube clips, short films, student-produced videos, and other media. However, there is rarely a way for me to show media to a whole class; many times, I have thirty-eight students crowd around my 13-inch laptop to show movies. My school's English department is in desperate need of an LCD projector, and I am turning to indiegogo for help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Shopping List</strong></p>
<p>Since teachers in Malaysia move between classes (rather than students), I envision a “media cart” that I (or another teacher, of course) can roll from class to class. This cart would have an LCD projector, but many other components are necessary for the equipment to be successful. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A case for the electronic equipment – most of the classroom are exposed to the elements (due to the heat), and humidity and rain could damage the equipment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-Quality Speakers – the classrooms at SKST are semi-enclosed and acoustically challenging</p>
</li>
<li>

Greetings from Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia! My name is Zack Wiener, and I am an American teaching English under the auspice of the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant program. I teach at Sekolah Kebangsaan Seberang Takir, a small primary school (years 4 - 12) in a fishing village outside of Kuala Terengganu, on the east coast of Malaysia. As a part of my job, I am committed to making English a living language for the students. In many cases, the Malaysian English language curriculum fails to instill a sense of vibrancy that the language has to offer. I seek to get students excited about speaking English through the use of media in the classroom. Primarily, I try my best to expose students to people around the world speaking English, whether through YouTube clips, short films, student-produced videos, and other media. However, there is rarely a way for me to show media to a whole class; many times, I have thirty-eight students crowd around my 13-inch laptop to show movies. My school's English department is in desperate need of an LCD projector, and I am turning to indiegogo for help!
 
The Shopping List
Since teachers in Malaysia move between classes (rather than students), I envision a “media cart” that I (or another teacher, of course) can roll from class to class. This cart would have an LCD projector, but many other components are necessary for the equipment to be successful. Namely:


A case for the electronic equipment – most of the classroom are exposed to the elements (due to the heat), and humidity and rain could damage the equipment


High-Quality Speakers – the classrooms at SKST are semi-enclosed and acoustically challenging


Surge-protected extension cord – many of the outlets in the classrooms are located high on the wall and far from the board.


Low-cost mobile projecting screen – for classrooms that do not have a screen or a clean wall.


A durable cart – to facilitate the mobility of the whole apparatus

 
Many of the materials here (the cart, the extension cords, and perhaps the speakers) are made here in Malaysia and therefore do not have a high tariff markup. The other goods (the LCD projector, case, and speakers) generally are imported from China, Japan, or Korea, making them subject to high import taxes and adding cost to the project. Therefore, what might seem like a cheap project in America is in practice much more expensive in Malaysia. Nevertheless, if I do not receive funding to my goal, I plan on using the funds foremost to buy the projector.

Hello, my name is Paul Herve. I'm the Producer of this documentary: The Mystery of the Mansoor Amarna Collection

ANY CONTRIBUTION ARE WELCOME:  $10 - $20 - $30 - $50  what ever you can.... 

The Cursed Treasure is an archaeological detective story.


The Impact: 

      Inside the depths of a Beverly Hills bank vault reside 33 pieces from one of the most controversial collections of ancient Egyptian art in history. Virtually unknown to all but a handful of Egyptologists and archaeologists, this collection of antiquities from the Amarna period, owned by the Mansoor family, has been at the heart of an unprecedented dispute between scientists and art historians for over fifty years.

     The Collection was once insured for $200 million. If genuine, it could be worth a billion dollars, but if the collection is a forgery, it would be the biggest scandal of the century. With unprecedented access to each of the exquisite pieces and exclusive interviews with several world-renowned authorities, the film exposes the intriguing history of both the collection and the fierce, almost conspiratorial, controversy surrounding it. 

      Could the Mansoor Amarna collection be subject to the same curse as Akhenaton? Who was this visionary pharaoh who commited the crime to believe in only one God? 


       From the USA to Egypt via France, Italy, Britain and Germany, this investigative documentary travels across the globe to museums such as the Boston Fine Arts Museum, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the Louvre, the Vatican, the Berlin Museum, as well as other captivating places such as the ruins of Akhenaton's capital in Tel-El-Amarna, Egypt. It will consist of  a judicious combination of video sequences, interviews, archival footage and photographs. 


       A true detective investigation in the murky waters of the art world, The Show will recount the incredible story of the Mansoor collection through the testimonies of all of those - - who have, directly or indirectly, been linked to the polemic: Egyptologists, scientists, museum curators and art historians. 

    ""When all the logical conjectures have been set aside, the one that remains, as improbable as it may seem, is likely to be true.""         Sir Arthur Conan Doyle A.K.A- Sherlock Holmes -

What We Need: 
    I'm seeking funding to hire a Video Editor for 5 months.I found a great person for $1000 a month and a back-end deal. The production of the documentary is done. We now have more than 100 hours of footage to edit. We went to Egypt twice with the collection's owner. We are ready to edit now...

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Santa Maria Community Services' International Welcome Center (IWC) provides English as a Second Language (ESL) classes for adult immigrants in Price Hill and beyond. English language learned in the ESL classes, helps individuals become more acclimated to the life and customs in their new home country, as well as improve their marketability for jobs. The IWC also provides free childcare for the children of ESL students during the class time, where the children receive tutoring and participate in enrichment activities.</p>
<p>We would like to provide a Mad Science class and expose the children to the wonderful world of science. We think that this is a great program to enrich and expose students to the science field early on. The field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field desires an increase in diversity, and we believe that this exposure to science early on can motivate, give students of diverse backgrounds the confidence to experience and pursue science in the future. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to provide this Mad Science program twice a year to the children of ESL students, we need $500.00 to cover the class registration and materials. We have every belief that we can reach our goal of $500.00 with your support, however in the event that we do not reach the goal we will offer one Mad Science class and continue to fundraise in other ways to reach the goal for two classes. </p>
<p>You will get personalized updates on progress and success of the Mad Science class, acknowledgement from the children benefiting from the class, and most importantly you will know that your contribution has made a positive impact and has helped families help themselves. </p>

We have every belief that we can reach our goal of $500.00 with your support, however in the event that we do not reach the goal we will offer one Mad Science class and continue to fundraise in other ways to reach the goal for two classes. 
You will get personalized updates on progress and success of the Mad Science class, acknowledgement from the children benefiting from the class, and most importantly you will know that your contribution has made a positive impact and has helped families help themselves.

They are so beautiful and so precious, loving and giving. I cherish them and want the best for them.""  Bev Carter</p>
<p>This project will be providing a dedicated study space, allowing the students regular access to hands on learning vital to their computer based subjects.

<p><strong>W</strong><strong>HO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>108 Lives Australia is a humanitarian not for profit organisation managed and run by Australian volunteers. As a branch the 108lives Project globally, our aim is to address areas of suffering and poverty, to connect with communities in order to help facilitate change for the better, 108 Lives at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the team currently working on this campaign. </strong></p>
<p>Bev Carter (Coordinator and Communication Liaison) and Jo Grant (Management and Implementation of Technical Logistics) are both volunteers for 108 lives Australia.</p>
<p>108 lives Australia are working in close partnership with the head staff at Mt Summit Boarding School in identifying and addressing the needs of the school. 108 lives Australia is also acting as liason and connection between Mt Summit Boarding School and Ashbury Public School for further planned educational opportunities between the schools.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>Mt Summit Boarding School is based in the Boudha region of Kathmandu, Nepal. 108 Lives Australia and Mt Summit began working in partnership with the pilot project, the 108 lives Project in 2012. It was during this first phase that the needs of Mt Summit were identified. </p>
<p>Mt Summit Boarding School regularly accept students from poor families or regions, supporting them in gaining the life changing benefit of education. Some of these children both live and learn at the school as their families struggle, often great distances away to make their meager livings. Due to the unfortunate loss of a long time sponsor in 2012, the school were left in dire financial need.</p>
<p>The funds the school currently operate on are barely enough to cover the most basic supplies and learning materials. The executive members of staff take no wage from the school. They earn their living at other teaching jobs at night and work within the school during the day, helping to subsidise the needs of the school and students from their own personal finances.</p>
<p>Of the 400+ enrolments for this school year (2013), 150 students are now directly supported and funded by the school.This includes 10 students from a new orphanage close by also in need of help in supporting their children.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>These beautiful, generous and talented students are dedicated learners and wish to continue further studies to obtain and secure good jobs in order to be able to help  support their families. They are fortunate in being abled to attend a school that works hard in supporting them.</p>
<p>In providing the tools to educate and prepare these students for success in the wider business world, we allow them the opportunity of a better, brighter future.  Their success will help break the cycle of poverty for themselves, their families and their extended communities.</p>
<p>108 Lives Australia are proud to be part of this change; wholeheartedly supporting this school in the belief that education is paramount to affecting social and economic change, and in helping to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>Give…. Share… and be the change!</p>

<p><strong>WHERE IT ALL BEGAN ?</strong></p>
<p>The 108 lives Project were successful in raising funds before arriving in Nepal in late October 2012. A team of 14 volunteers worked across a series of Project areas including 2 schools, 2 orphanages, Indian camp, and with an organisation providing soup kitchens and medical support to beggars and homeless on the streets.</p>
<p>Bev Carter and Evan Shapiro were head of liason and work with Mt Summit Boarding School. Valuable time spent in discussion with the head of staff provided the opportunity to exchange ideas, as well as learning about the needs of the school and students.</p>
<p>Funds dedicated to Mt Summit Boarding School saw three new storage cupboards and twenty new school benches ordered, which were made locally and helped to provide needed seating for growing student numbers.</p>
<p>The provision of creative learning experiences for the children brought much joy, engagement and expressive opportunities. Play is an integral and important part of learning and development for children and creative expression has emotional and therapeutic benefits. The children participated in painting and drawing, water colours, finger painting, chalk drawing, playdough, bubbles and balloons.</p>
<p>The outcome for the children, who get few opportunities for creative exploration, were delighted with these new experiences, participating with great joy and enthusiasm. The activities and time spent in discussion also helped in identifying focus areas for future work.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Miriam Rauth. For a long time, I’m interested in a country called Ethiopia and how people live there. After school I’d like to spend a year as volunteer and work there. To get the projects known I’d like to travel to Ethiopia in fall for two weeks.</p>

Patient Privacy Rights Foundation is a nonprofit, mostly volunteer-run, bi-partisan
organization that needs your help.
Historically, PPR has provided services to individuals and worked
with privacy, consumer, civil and human rights, and social justice
organizations worldwide to prevent government and corporations from controlling
and using patients’ sensitive personal health data.   

Since this
summer’s revelations about NSA’s massive spying programs, PPR has been
busier than ever.  Those who oppose the NSA’s actions are now
discovering PPR’s critical work in exposing the surveillance and use of personal
health data.

This is great!  Yet, PPR is struggling to keep up with
the increased demand on our limited resoources.  PPR, this small group of
activists, needs more hands and more support.  We need funds to help build an app to help educate to public and bring awareness to a much larger audience.  Our PRIVACY APP will list the privacy policies of different hospitals, health care plans - including Healthcare.gov, mobile health sites, and pharmacies.  We will list the pros and cons of these privacy policies and rank them for the public to have a better understanding, letting everyone know who they can trust and if their data is really safe.




What does PPR do?

PPR is a different nature of service provider.  What we believe is simple:
“Individuals should be in control of their own health information.”

Currently, there are no limits to the types of organizations that can gain access to your sensitive health information—employers, advertisers, insurers, you name it. It’s important that we act now to preserve our right to privacy.  We must take steps to regain control over our personal information.  At PPR, we believe it should always be up to you to decide what happens to your sensitive information.  You should be able to know and control who sees it, where it goes, and why.
PPR is the largest non-profit advocating for health privacy.  PPR and its coalition host the nation’s
largest and most unique privacy event, The Health Privacy Summit.  It is an inclusive event; it offers the best forum in the world for high-level, thoughtful discussions covering the most
urgent national and international health privacy issues; and more importantly, it recommends solutions.  Further, PPR contributes heavily to a number of different conferences and privacy
projects.  We accomplish our work largely with volunteers and relying completely on donations.


***Protecting health privacy isn’t just important for your own health and well-being today, but what we do now affects our future generations.  PPR cares deeply about protecting personal privacy; we believe that people should be measured by who they are and what they are capable of doing, not their medical history.***

Click here to watch a video and listen to Dr. Deborah Peel, Founder and Chair of PPR, talk about why health privacy is important to all of us.
 
Okay, brilliant.  Bottom line is PPR is fighting for
us...what else? This is what you really need to know:

Here and now, having Patient Privacy Rights existing
and growing is more important than ever. Here’s an example why:

In response to the leaks about the NSA’s blanket surveillance
programs, more and more people are becoming concerned about their data – and
that includes sensitive health data.

Predictive analytics is the use of big data to predict trends and behavior patterns; it can be used to increase profits and to potentially improve healthcare.  However, predictive
analytics can also be defined as involuntary data collection and surveillance that may lead to unintended consequences such as discrimination. It is this key result of predictive analytics that most people don’t comprehend. PPR serves as an effective key in helping
educate people about the dangers and prevalence of
data surveillance, and how that correlates to their health information.

Yet, PPR is a small organization.  Our volunteers donate
their time and efforts to educate the public about what they can do to protect
their privacy and prevent things like discrimination.





Your medical records are your business.  
Help us build our app and protect your privacy by contributing to PPR today!





Where your money goes: 

Specifically, PPR is planning on developing educational tools like videos and apps to help educate the public about health privacy.  We need $10,000 to cover these costs:


privacy-friendly technology and technical support
beginning phases of developing educational materials (for app development)
public outreach and collaboration
wages for dedicated human staff to plan and organize
other miscellaneous expenses

Campaign seeks $10,000 total

<p>El equipo de Olimpiadas de la Universidad de Costa Rica nace como una iniciativa del estudiante Daniel Campos quien en el 2009 decide participar en la primera CIIM donde obtiene una medalla de plata. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/76361/files/20130915192925-IMG_1929.JPG?1379298565"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>De izquierda a derecha: Daniel Campos, Daniel Barrantes, Javier Rodriguez y William Alvarado, durante la CIIM del 2011 en Ecuador.</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Desde ese momento, con el apoyo del profesor William Alvarado, el movimiento empieza a crecer, actualmente contamos con mas de 10 estudiantes, quienes motivados por el deseo de profundizar sus estudios y compartir sus conocimientos con el mundo, nos reunimos todos los sábados para resolver problemas y discutir temas que nos interesen.</p>
<h4>Sobre la competencia:</h4>
<p><i>""La I Competencia Iberoamericana Interuniversitaria de Matemáticas nace 
con el ánimo de incentivar el estudio de las matemáticas y la excelencia
 académica en nuestra comunidad universitaria iberoamericana, mejorando

EspañolSaludos, somos el equipo de Olimpiadas de Matemática de la Universidad de Costa Rica y nos gustaria participar en la V Competencia Iberoamericana Interuniversitaria de Matemáticas (CIIM) a realizarse en Armenia, Colombia del 15 al 20 de octubre.Nuestra corta historia:
El equipo de Olimpiadas de la Universidad de Costa Rica nace como una iniciativa del estudiante Daniel Campos quien en el 2009 decide participar en la primera CIIM donde obtiene una medalla de plata. 


De izquierda a derecha: Daniel Campos, Daniel Barrantes, Javier Rodriguez y William Alvarado, durante la CIIM del 2011 en Ecuador.

Desde ese momento, con el apoyo del profesor William Alvarado, el movimiento empieza a crecer, actualmente contamos con mas de 10 estudiantes, quienes motivados por el deseo de profundizar sus estudios y compartir sus conocimientos con el mundo, nos reunimos todos los sábados para resolver problemas y discutir temas que nos interesen.
Sobre la competencia:
""La I Competencia Iberoamericana Interuniversitaria de Matemáticas nace 
con el ánimo de incentivar el estudio de las matemáticas y la excelencia
 académica en nuestra comunidad universitaria iberoamericana, mejorando 
las capacidades científicas a través de la motivación y de la 
competitividad internacional aportando así al desarrollo social, 
cultural y económico de nuestros países."" - Tomado de la página oficial de la CIIM
En realidad la importancia de esta competencia trasciende sus objetivos principales, desde sus inicios la competencia ha sido un ambiente donde matemáticos jóvenes latinoamericanos pueden compartir y convivir, básicamente conectando esta área geográfica que es ya bastante uniforme pero se encuentra separada por líneas imaginarias. Estas conexiones son vitales para el desarrollo matemático de la región.


Participantes de la IV CIIM en Guanajuato Mexico. 
Como si fuera poco, el prestigioso Instituto de Matemática Pura y Aplicada (IMPA), localizado en Rio de Janeiro, recompensa a los medallistas de esta competencia con becas para asistir al instituto durante el verano.
Por qué necesitamos su ayuda:

Debido a que este movimiento es una iniciativa completamente estudiantil contamos únicamente con nuestros propios recursos que, podrán imaginarse, no son muchos. Contamos por supuesto con ayuda por parte de algunas instituciones de la universidad sin embargo debido a ciertos reglamentos internos y otras limitaciones la universidad no cubre completamente nuestra participación.
El año pasado fue el primer año que logramos llevar un equipo entero a participar. Esto se logró gracias a una intensiva campaña de recolección de fondos organizada por nosotros mismos la cual incluyó una exitosa campaña en Indiegogo.

Greetings, we are the Math Olympics team from the University of Costa Rica and we would like to participate on the V Iberoamerican Interuniversitary Math Competition (CIIM because of its initials in Spanish) to be held in Armenia, Colombia from October 15 to October 20.

Our Short story:
The Math Olympics team was born as an initiative by the student Daniel Campos who in 2009 decided to participate in the first CIIM, winning a silver medal.

Truthfully the importance of this competition transcends its principal objectives. From its start the competition has been an opportunity for young Latinamerican mathematicians to get together and share, basically connecting this already homogeneous geographic zone separated only by imaginary lines. These connections are vital for the region's mathematical development.


Participants of the IV CIIM in Guanajuato Mexico. 

If that weren't enough, the prestigious Institute of Pure and Applied Math (IMPA because of its initials in Portuguese) located in Rio de Janeiro, rewards the medalists with scholarships to attend the Institute during summer.
Why we need your help:
Given that this movement is completely managed by students, we can only count on our own resources. Which, being students, aren't many. Of course we can depend on some support from our university; however, due to some internal rules and other limitations, the university won't finance our participation completely.
Last year was the first time we managed to bring a full team to compete. This was achieved thanks to an intensive fundraising effort organized by ourselves, which included a successful Indiegogo campaign.

As explained earlier, just participating in the competition is of great importance to us, still, since its first participation the University of Costa Rica has won medals consistently:

2009, Daniel Campos, silver medal

2011, Daniel Campos, gold medal

2011, Daniel Barrantes, bronze medal

2012, Daniel Barrantes, bronze medal

<p><a href=""http://www.21inc.ca/index.php/en/programs/current-cohort/item/195-tara-brinston"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">In recognition of my work in the disability field and community</a>, I was named one of 21inc’s Top 50 Emerging Leaders in Atlantic Canada. You can learn more about my work and vision in the video above :) 21inc is, in their own words, a nonprofit action tank committed to developing high performance leaders in Atlantic Canada’s most promising young people, aged 20 to 35. Since its founding, many of Atlantic Canada’s top leaders under age 35 have used 21inc leadership experiences to start new economic and community ventures and propel careers, making a significant impact in the economic and social wellbeing of the region. It is inspiring and a true honor to be selected, and I need your support! </p>
<p>Please consider contributing to support the leadership development of young change makers in Atlantic Canada. Believe in us, we're passionate about doing good! </p>
<h3>Now that we've made the goal! </h3>
<p>Your financial support will allow me to take part in 21inc's 2013 <em>Emerging Leaders’ Summit,</em> being held in Nova Scotia in late October.<em> </em>As one of the top 50 emerging leaders, I am required to fundraise $500 for 21inc. Donations will be used by 21inc to support the alumni network of young leaders and to ensure the organization’s sustainability.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>21inc is built on the philosophy that leaders don't just appear; they are developed by others, who, seeing something special, reach out and draw them into a support system to harness a person's leadership potential and convert it into action. 21inc builds learning networks between diverse and inspiring groups of emerging and established provincial and regional leaders. By facilitating ""creative collisions"" between the people who can propel new models of leadership and action, our communities, provinces, and region will thrive in the 21st century.	</p>

Please help us help others! With your contribution, a grieving family will have a powerful chance to come together. They need this more than anything right now!

TLC Changed Our Lives
Our family came to TLC and together discovered the things that block us from having the closeness we say we want.
As a result, we are more patient with each other. We love and talk to each other on a deeper level. 
TLC has changed our whole family’s interactions and perspectives. We are now more understanding, more supportive of each other, and happier in our relationships because of the TLC experience.
We so badly want others to have this extraordinary gift of peace and healing!
 What We Need & What You GetWe are incredibly appreciative of any funding you are able to contribute to this project. The $2500 raised will go toward:
Tuition
Accomodations
Meals
Indiegogo commission ( ? )
Your contribution will get you a cool perk, atop of the priceless feeling that you've done something kind for others in need this holiday season!
What you receive depends on the amount you give.
Any extra money raised will go to the next TLC students we want to send.
If we don't reach our goal of $2500, we will set the funds aside until we are able to raise the amount needed to send this particular family to TLC.
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are truly unable to contribute, that's okay! There are other ways to help us out:
Keep this family in your thoughts and prayers.
Please share this campaign with your networks - email, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
Tell your friends about what we are doing and get them excited about this opportunity to help a family in need!
Indiegogo has sharing tools as well - give us a ""like"" or post to various social media sites.

Sending out big love and hugs!In Gratitude,Maria & Angela",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Despite international disaster relief and aid, the path in rebuilding homes, restoring infrastructure, and regenerating livelihoods has been and will continue to be a long one.<br/><br/>Three of my good friends - Allen, Orion, and Juliette - were traveling just outside the Everest basecamp when the first earthquake hit on April 25. After receiving news of their safety, they told me that they will stay in the country to assist in the emergency relief efforts, distribution of supplies, and anything else they can give a lending hand. They partnered with local organizations and visited a number of villages outside the capital city where access was difficult or impossible by vehicle due to damaged roads to assess the needs of the communities and distribute essential items.<br/><br/>In the weeks that followed, they formed <b>Conscious Impact</b> (<a href=""www.consciousimpact.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.consciousimpact.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.consciousimpact.org</a>) and launched an Indiegogo fundraiser to collect donations from their friends and family to directly help the work on the ground.

See <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10102386432891264"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a> for an example and explanation filmed by the team. Over the course of 3 months, they were able to raise enough money to fund their day-to-day operations, capacity building, gather supplies and resources for current and upcoming builds, as well as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153146977021483&amp;set=a.223647351482.134506.604426482&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">investing it in the form of knowledge</a>.<br/><br/>In June it became clear to me that my friends and I should join forces. I requested personal time off from work and soon booked round trip tickets for Kathmandu. Between September 5 and October 17, I will be working alongside the team plus dozens of other volunteers from around the world to learn, build, and document the process and life as it is for the Nepali people. The Conscious Impact team have partnered up with another non-governmental organization named <b>YUWA Unity Nepal </b>(<a href=""www.yuwaunitynepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.yuwaunitynepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yuwaunitynepal.org</a>) and have been working closely with community leaders and families in the village of Takure, Sindhapocuk. The main builds will take place between September 17-26 and October 5-14. These dates were set as the region transitions out of the monsoon season, ie: the rainy months between June - early September. I will also be joined by Luke Namer and Sebastian Buffa, 2 videographers from <b>Redefined Films</b><i> </i>(<a href=""www.redefinedfilms.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.redefinedfilms.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.redefinedfilms.org</a>) from New York to co-create a series of stills, video shorts, and written pieces to be published on our social media networks and websites.<br/><br/><p>The preparations up to this point has been entirely self-funded, and I humbly ask for your financial contribution. This to me is an incredible intersection of my passions in photography and videography to raise awareness and do social as well as environmental good. <b>I need your support in this journey. </b>The intensity of and damages from this natural disaster is on a scale beyond most of our full comprehension. It frustrates me that mainstream media and other news channels have turned their attention away from the persistence and resilience of the Nepali people. <b>There is joy amidst the chaos, beauty besides the fallen structures, and strong human spirit to be shared and inspire further.</b> I believe that it is crucial to share this essential work and the stories of the people whose lives and voices would otherwise never reach a global audience. Through your financial support, I am confident that we can give back to our global community to create a positive, conscious impact together.<br/></p><p>As my friends say it best:</p><blockquote><h2>
<span><span><b>""... we understand that we gain peace, harmony and happiness through serving others.</b></span></span>""</h2></blockquote><p>Thank you!</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><h3>Who is Jonathan?</h3><p>I am a photographer, social and environmental activist, adventure-seeker, and earth steward.<br/></p><p>I am captivated by the sheer natural beauty of our planet in its finest moments. I seek to capture the genuine expressions in people and the human element of our built environment. I am fascinated by indigenous peoples and their intrinsic connections to the land, flora, and fauna.<br/></p><p>During my university days, I became actively involved with grassroots, student coalitions to raise awareness on and act upon issues surrounding social and environmental sustainability. The involvement led to my belief for urgent climate action and in forming resilient, interdependent communities worldwide. After graduating, I had the opportunity to live and work in Panama, where I coordinated environmental development projects alongside empowered student volunteers and indigenous Guna and Emberá villagers. This was a pivotal period of my life as I learned the immensely complex realm of sustainable development while refining my art to expose global issues that matter, unique cultures worth learning about, environments needing preservation, and adventures that inspire.<br/><br/>I am humbled and honored to have had my work published on Viajes National Geographic, Grist.org, Gaiacraft, United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Global Brigades, Earth Train, GROW Worldwide, Beacon Food Forest, Great March for Climate Action, La Prensa Panamá, and more. In autumn 2012, I hosted a photo exhibit in Panama City and attracted hundreds of Panamanians and travelers on an evening where I shared my adventures and human experiences throughout the country. Through my photographs and stories, I was able to inspire others to respect as well as admire the places, cultures, and beauty our world unrelentingly offers. The experience brought tremendous joy, and I intend to continue the path of socially and environmentally impactful photography.<br/><br/>One of my latest passions is in sustainable food systems. In the growing season of 2013, I ventured on a 8 and a half-month bicycle journey across the Pacific Northwest and U.S. west coast to intersect learning, service, and art by being immersed in and capturing the intricacies of organic food production on various family-run farms. During my southbound journey towards (then-)home in southern California, I leveraged social media and photography to <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-pixel-filled-bicycle-tour/x/580491#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">raise money via Indiegogo</a> to support myself as well as the great work of <a href=""http://www.350.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">350.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.conservacionpatagonica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conservacion Patagonica</a> for the incredible work they have been doing on climate action and land regeneration.<br/></p><p>Since the summer of 2014, I have been situated in Seattle, Washington and have continued my involvement with the local food system and permaculture transition alongside the great individuals behind the <a href=""http://www.beaconfoodforest.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beacon Food Forest</a>, exploring the magical Olympic/Cascade mountains, while living a simple, low-carbon footprint lifestyle.</p><p></p><p>On August 13, 2015, I hosted a presentation and talk on the work that
 the Conscious Impact team has been doing since the earthquake. Over 30 people attended the event to 
hear about and take part in learning about the efforts, stay connected, 
and pitch in to the work. I am so very grateful for everyone's support 
and plan to host a post-trip event in Seattle upon my return in the fall (last couple weeks of October and/or November).<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440693286/mhboyqyijbz1ssukduhg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>Liz giving an Nepali well-wishing</i><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440693304/a1prhktvxefmvus44p0o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Funding Breakdown</h2><p>I really value transparency, and wish for you to know that the $3000 goal was set based on the following costs and needs. The additional camera equipment include: a second camera body, an extra travel tripod, a microphone, and a portable photo printer (for the postcard perks and printing images for our partners + families we'll be working with and getting to know). <br/></p><p>I was tipped by a friend to fly in and out of Vancouver, Canada instead of Seattle, Washington due to lower costs (~$240). So I thought even with the additional travel time and bus fare, this is ultimately savings that can keep the budget as low as possible.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440829489/mvqzo7ralwcel49ktawm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>Timeline</b></h2><p>My speculation as to how the following 5 months and beyond will look like with this project. I hope to be able to get the photos from Nepal up for viewing and selection between late October and November of this year, while photo (perks, see below!) deliveries will commence late November and be wrapped up by the first month of 2016. Depending on the progress the Redefined Films crew and I make while in-country and the remote collaboration to follow post-October, we have discussed launching a short film by the end of 2015. I will do my best to keep everyone posted!<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440909193/wzjlrgqpwmercneqfvb1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2><b>Perks</b></h2><p>Besides my (our) sincere gratitude for your support, I would love for you to have something memorable in return.</p><p>My
 photographs from the 6 weeks in Nepal will be organized, edited, and 
uploaded into a gallery for you to view, read, and learn the context 
&amp; story. If you are able to pitch in at the $70 level or higher, 
please choose your favorite photograph(s) to be printed and mail to you.
 The matting will be custom cut by yours truly to the next popular size,
 e.g. 16""x24"" matte for the 12""x18"" print, for easy (and beautiful) 
display and/or framing. </p><p>For the 12""x18"" and 16""x24""-sized 
prints, you'd have the opportunity to choose a single or multiple images
 to be made into a collage. <br/></p><p>Perhaps the most exciting perk I am offering is the 
Photo Book, which is going to be a layflat, flush mount, hard cover 
photo book that's going to have approximately 20 pages filled with my very 
best, hand-picked images from Nepal. The Photo Book measures 6""x8"".</p><p>Shipping
 cost for the enlargements and photo book depends on your location, e.g.
 US least, Canada a bit higher, rest of the world most. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440971464/e8zxjzwbbvftzfactcyr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p><p>A sneak peek - Elliese and Naomi with my matted prints at my Panama

This means that what they do ""depends on the interests, desires, and passions of our (their) partners."" This includes community members, partner organizations, and volunteers, like myself and others I'll be joined with. <br/></p><p>My friends have had 7 years of experience working in rural development and international service in Latin America (through where we met) and Africa. They have taken the experience and knowledge and distilled it into their current mission ""to inspire, mobilize, and train volunteers to compassionately and selflessly service those in need."" The team is in it for international, cross-cultural collaborations, and it is not their intention, like certain big names in the development world, to be in it for the long-run. In my opinion, this should never be the case. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440657296/rhq0cyw2fu81rbmoini4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h2><b>Plan B?</b></h2>There really isn't. It's not what I am aiming for. I am (we are) absolutely committed to this project. The
 trip to Nepal is still happening and the 
documentation will still take place, even in the event the goal of $3000 is not reached. Thanks to the flexible funding option of Indiegogo, the raised funds will still come through to make this project a reality. The lower funding and with it the potential financial stress would have a negative impact on my ability to bring forth our experiences in-country to their maximum potential and reach. I believe we can collectively make this happen, and in fact surpass the goal!<br/><br/><h2><b>Connect / Spread the Word!</b></h2>If you have any questions about the work that I'll be doing with the Conscious Impact team, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. This fundraiser has made possible thanks to the superb support that so many of my family and friends have given me. It is curiously difficult to ask for monetary support from those you love and cherish. I absolutely understand if a financial contribution is not possible at this moment, and would be equally thankful if you could share this fundraiser and the work being done. Awareness-raising is invaluable.<br/><br/>With gratitude,<br/>Jonathan<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><b><br/></b><p><b>Conscious Impact </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span><a href=""http://www.consciousimpact.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></a><a href=""http://www.consciousimpact.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.consciousimpact.org </a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Facebook: </span><a href=""http://www.fb.com/consciousimpact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></a><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/consciousimpact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook.com/consciousimpact </a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Instagram: <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/consciousimpact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@consciousimpact</a></span><br/><br/><b>YUWA Unity Nepal</b><a href=""http://www.yuwaunitynepal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></a><a href=""http://www.yuwaunitynepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yuwaunitynepal.org</a><b><br/><br/>ABARI </b><a href=""http://www.abari.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></a><a href=""http://www.abari.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.abari.org</a><b><br/></b>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/abari.nepal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/abari.nepal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook.com/abari.nepal</a><br/>Instagram: <a href=""https://instagram.com/abari_nepal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@abari_nepal</a></p><p><b>Redefined Films<br/></b><a href=""http://redefinedfilms.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.redefinedfilms.org</a><br/>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/redefined.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook.com/redefined.org</a><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Jonathan H.

The involvement led to my belief for urgent climate action and in forming resilient, interdependent communities worldwide. After graduating, I had the opportunity to live and work in Panama, where I coordinated environmental development projects alongside empowered student volunteers and indigenous Guna and Emberá villagers. This was a pivotal period of my life as I learned the immensely complex realm of sustainable development while refining my art to expose global issues that matter, unique cultures worth learning about, environments needing preservation, and adventures that inspire.I am humbled and honored to have had my work published on Viajes National Geographic, Grist.org, Gaiacraft, United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, Global Brigades, Earth Train, GROW Worldwide, Beacon Food Forest, Great March for Climate Action, La Prensa Panamá, and more. In autumn 2012, I hosted a photo exhibit in Panama City and attracted hundreds of Panamanians and travelers on an evening where I shared my adventures and human experiences throughout the country. Through my photographs and stories, I was able to inspire others to respect as well as admire the places, cultures, and beauty our world unrelentingly offers. The experience brought tremendous joy, and I intend to continue the path of socially and environmentally impactful photography.One of my latest passions is in sustainable food systems. In the growing season of 2013, I ventured on a 8 and a half-month bicycle journey across the Pacific Northwest and U.S. west coast to intersect learning, service, and art by being immersed in and capturing the intricacies of organic food production on various family-run farms. During my southbound journey towards (then-)home in southern California, I leveraged social media and photography to raise money via Indiegogo to support myself as well as the great work of 350.org and Conservacion Patagonica for the incredible work they have been doing on climate action and land regeneration.Since the summer of 2014, I have been situated in Seattle, Washington and have continued my involvement with the local food system and permaculture transition alongside the great individuals behind the Beacon Food Forest, exploring the magical Olympic/Cascade mountains, while living a simple, low-carbon footprint lifestyle.On August 13, 2015, I hosted a presentation and talk on the work that
 the Conscious Impact team has been doing since the earthquake. Over 30 people attended the event to 
hear about and take part in learning about the efforts, stay connected, 
and pitch in to the work. I am so very grateful for everyone's support 
and plan to host a post-trip event in Seattle upon my return in the fall (last couple weeks of October and/or November).Liz giving an Nepali well-wishingFunding BreakdownI really value transparency, and wish for you to know that the $3000 goal was set based on the following costs and needs. The additional camera equipment include: a second camera body, an extra travel tripod, a microphone, and a portable photo printer (for the postcard perks and printing images for our partners + families we'll be working with and getting to know). I was tipped by a friend to fly in and out of Vancouver, Canada instead of Seattle, Washington due to lower costs (~$240). So I thought even with the additional travel time and bus fare, this is ultimately savings that can keep the budget as low as possible.TimelineMy speculation as to how the following 5 months and beyond will look like with this project. I hope to be able to get the photos from Nepal up for viewing and selection between late October and November of this year, while photo (perks, see below!) deliveries will commence late November and be wrapped up by the first month of 2016. Depending on the progress the Redefined Films crew and I make while in-country and the remote collaboration to follow post-October, we have discussed launching a short film by the end of 2015. I will do my best to keep everyone posted!PerksBesides my (our) sincere gratitude for your support, I would love for you to have something memorable in return.My
 photographs from the 6 weeks in Nepal will be organized, edited, and 
uploaded into a gallery for you to view, read, and learn the context 
& story. If you are able to pitch in at the $70 level or higher, 
please choose your favorite photograph(s) to be printed and mail to you.
 The matting will be custom cut by yours truly to the next popular size,
 e.g. 16""x24"" matte for the 12""x18"" print, for easy (and beautiful) 
display and/or framing. For the 12""x18"" and 16""x24""-sized 
prints, you'd have the opportunity to choose a single or multiple images
 to be made into a collage. Perhaps the most exciting perk I am offering is the 
Photo Book, which is going to be a layflat, flush mount, hard cover 
photo book that's going to have approximately 20 pages filled with my very 
best, hand-picked images from Nepal. The Photo Book measures 6""x8"".Shipping
 cost for the enlargements and photo book depends on your location, e.g.
 US least, Canada a bit higher, rest of the world most. A sneak peek - Elliese and Naomi with my matted prints at my Panama 
City photo gallery. I truly, truly enjoy sharing my vision of the world 
with others.About Conscious ImpactConscious Impact's approach is unique in that they are a community and volunteer-led organization. This means that what they do ""depends on the interests, desires, and passions of our (their) partners."" This includes community members, partner organizations, and volunteers, like myself and others I'll be joined with. My friends have had 7 years of experience working in rural development and international service in Latin America (through where we met) and Africa. They have taken the experience and knowledge and distilled it into their current mission ""to inspire, mobilize, and train volunteers to compassionately and selflessly service those in need."" The team is in it for international, cross-cultural collaborations, and it is not their intention, like certain big names in the development world, to be in it for the long-run. In my opinion, this should never be the case. Plan B?There really isn't. It's not what I am aiming for. I am (we are) absolutely committed to this project. The
 trip to Nepal is still happening and the 
documentation will still take place, even in the event the goal of $3000 is not reached. Thanks to the flexible funding option of Indiegogo, the raised funds will still come through to make this project a reality. The lower funding and with it the potential financial stress would have a negative impact on my ability to bring forth our experiences in-country to their maximum potential and reach. I believe we can collectively make this happen, and in fact surpass the goal!Connect / Spread the Word!If you have any questions about the work that I'll be doing with the Conscious Impact team, please don't hesitate to contact me directly. This fundraiser has made possible thanks to the superb support that so many of my family and friends have given me. It is curiously difficult to ask for monetary support from those you love and cherish. I absolutely understand if a financial contribution is not possible at this moment, and would be equally thankful if you could share this fundraiser and the work being done. Awareness-raising is invaluable.With gratitude,Jonathan------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conscious Impact www.consciousimpact.org Facebook: facebook.com/consciousimpact Instagram: @consciousimpactYUWA Unity Nepalwww.yuwaunitynepal.orgABARI www.abari.orgFacebook: facebook.com/abari.nepalInstagram: @abari_nepalRedefined Filmswww.redefinedfilms.orgFacebook: facebook.com/redefined.orgJonathan H.

<p>Hello everyone!  Megan here.</p>
<p>I'm writing today because I need
a favor. But, it's a really good favor.  I promise! As many of you know
(and if you don't know you are about to find out), I recently accepted a
position as a program associate with an organization called Exponential
Education in Ghana, west Africa. Expo is honestly one of the coolest
initiatives I have come across and I am so thrilled to be working for
them!  </p>
<p>Essentially,
in Ghana children have to pay to attend high school.  While the fees may
seem small, many children cannot afford it.  Additionally, middle school
students have to pass an entrance exam to get into high school, and currently
60% of students don't pass this exam.  Expo has found a way to help these
students.  Through their peer-tutoring program, they work with schools to
find high school students who are struggling to pay their school fees.
 They give those students a stipend to cover their fees, and in return
those students tutor five middle school students to help them pass their
entrance exam into high school.  Then at the end, the most dedicated high
school student receives a scholarship to go to university. Pretty cool huh?!
They also offer a girls leadership program, teacher training, college prep, and
other things.  It's all pretty wonderful.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>As you read this summary, over 150 Ghanaian students that
used to be at-risk of dropping out of school or failing school entrance exams
are now studying, teaching and receiving free tutoring and scholarships this
week in order to build themselves a better future.</p>
<p>To
date, Exponential Education has successfully completed over 45 Exponential
Education programs. That means that the organization has provided over 45
college scholarships for high school students, 225 high school assistance
stipends to keep students financially at risk of dropping out enrolled in
school, and provided free tutoring in basic Math and English to over 1350 students. </p>
<p>Here's
where you come in.  Expo is a very small organization.  And each
program only costs $500 to run.  $500=5 high school students staying in
high school+25 middle school students receiving tutoring+1 student receiving a
university scholarship. So, $500 goes a long way, but it needs to come from
somewhere.  So please pretty please, donate a little (or if you can, donate a lot!)</p>
<p>As
it will be my job as a program associate to run one of these tutoring programs
in one high school and one middle school, $500 can ensure that an group of students
I work with can reach their full potential.  However, there are other program associates and other
schools that need funding too, so I’m aiming to raise $1500! </p>
<p><b>Ways
You Can Help</b></p>
<p>After donating, if you want, dump a bucket of ice cold water over your head
to encourage others to donate, share this link on facebook, tell your coworker
or your mom or your neighbor about it and ask them to donate, donate again.
 The options are endless!  Go ahead, get creative, but please help me
spread the word!</p>

<h3>What Is REBEL VERSES?</h3>
<p>REBEL VERSES is a two-week festival of performances by some of the best youth companies in the region. Unlike any other theatre festival, REBEL VERSES provides an opportunity for high school students to perform their own original work and to celebrate the work of their peers, and gives audiences a platform for open dialogue with emerging young artists from New York City and around the region.</p>
<p>Now in its 13th year, the festival was born out of the need for a platform where young artists can express themselves honestly and in an environment that recognizes the legitimacy of all stories and backgrounds. With a mission to journey into the unapologetic and unrestrained creativity of the next generation, REBEL VERSES values diverse stories ranging across age, sex, race and time.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Here's Where You Come In</h3>
<p>REBEL VERSES is constantly growing and evolving. This year, the Festival’s relocation to The Vineyard means an opportunity for larger audiences, more technical support, and a bigger, better festival. For the first time students will perform in an Off-Broadway theatre, a larger venue than ever before. This expansion also means higher costs to ensure the festival runs smoothly and successfully. Since The Vineyard and Developing Artists are also committed to ensuring the Festival is affordable to the student’s family, each participating student receives two complimentary tickets, leaving the expenses of the Festival covered primarily by donations rather than ticket sales.</p>
<p>Vineyard Theatre is inviting you to partner with us in producing REBEL VERSES. The goal is to raise $7,500 towards supporting new voices in the arts.</p>

<p>Contributions will support free tickets for friends and family of student artists, low cost tickets for students and educators, Vineyard’s front- and back-of-house staff working directly on the Festival, and audio equipment so the voices of our young artists can be heard loud and clear. All gifts up to our goal of $7,500 will go directly towards the Festival’s budget. Any funds raised beyond the budget will support The Vineyard’s growing education programs, which partners with New York City public high schools in the Union Square neighborhood to provide professional training and arts education experiences to over 650 high school students every year at no cost.</p>

Columbia University and Barnard College in New York City. <br/></p><p>We were born, raised
and earned our undergraduate education in the midst of the Colombian internal
armed conflict (Guerrilla and paramilitary warfare, drug trafficking,
political violence, etc.). In addition, we both know first-hand what poverty, inequality, racism and discrimination, political, physical, verbal and symbolic violence are. Therefore, we deeply believe that WE ALL SHOULD ACT NOW AND STAND AGAINST ALL THOSE ILLS THAT OUR  COUNTRY  -AND THE WHOLE WORLD BY EXTENSION- HAVE EXPERIENCE THROUGH OUR LONG HISTORY.<br/></p>
<p>For instance,  we strongly believe that in order to have the
long awaited peace in OUR HOME COUNTRY COLOMBIA, every Colombian citizen and their
allies need to contribute what they can. Thus, we are starting this our first fundraising campaign to
secure the necessary funds to establishing a non-for-profit and nongovernmental
international organization entitled:</p>

<p>As seasoned educators ourselves both in Colombia and in The United States, our main goal is to contribute our two cents in the efforts of

believe that our two children -Samuelito and Nicolás- and the children of all Colombians deserve a
better and more peaceful and just future in our nation and elsewhere. We in our family
have made this our life-long project and we welcome with open arms anyone who shares
our beliefs.</p>
<p>Every dollar and act of individual capacity will be
used towards our grassroots efforts to educate children and adults in Colombia
and overseas, as well as the general public, about and with concrete ways for making
Colombia a more humane and peaceful country. The very first instance of this is
already ongoing. We have being running a campaign over Facebook and social
media entitled <i>""LET'S BRING PEACE TO COLOMBIA ONE WORD AT A TIME /</i>
CONSTRUYAMOS LA PAZ EN COLOMBIA PALABRA POR PALABRA<i>"".  </i>It consists
of an awareness raising operation concerning the realization and removal of

Colombia’s every day oral and written discourse. </p>

survival of phenomenology.Rudolf Bernet, Husserl Archives Leuven



What We Want To Do
We have been building the Open Commons for a year already. As you can judge for yourself from our website, we are making solid progress. Now is the time to accelerate the project's development and turn it into a truly comprehensive and sustainable resource. To achieve this, we have set ourselves three great objectives - to be completed with your generous support in the next 12 months:

 1. Input the full bibliographies of at least 10 major authors
We've selected Brentano, Scheler, Stein, Patočka, Ingarden, Fink, Sartre, Levinas, Derrida and Henry. Write to us to add others!




2. Digitise Edmund Husserl's complete work in German
All digitised texts will be made available immediately in open access under a CC-BY license. In other words, you can access AND use them completely for free.



3. Translate parts of Husserl's correspondence into English

Letters to Brentano, Frege, Stumpf, Dilthey, Scheler, Cassirer, Heidegger, Fink, Patočka, Jaspers. All translations will also be made available immediately under a CC-BY license.




This initiative will surely strengthen and improve the ongoing work of scholars of various brands of phenomenological philosophy all over the world.
Sonja Rinofner-Kreidl, Graz University

<b>A Tribute to
Melat’s Life</b></p>
<p>November 23 will forever be seared in our mind
as the day we lost our dearest friend and sister Melat Woldearegay. She was planning for her dreams and
happiness when she unexpectedly passed from this world in a tragic car accident. Her sudden departure has shaken us to the
core and left a gaping hole in our hearts. Regret has engulfed our hearts as we thought we had plenty of time to tell Melat what an extraordinary human being she was or how so loved and admired she was
and STILL IS. </p><p>We so love Melat’s: <b>bigger than life personality</b>
that lit up a room; <strong>excessive</strong> <b>loyalty</b>, sometimes to a fault, to her friends and family;  <b>relentless suppor</b>t to those she loved no matter what they do or where they
are in life; ability to <b>instantly connect with people</b> from all walks of life – Melat
never met a stranger; and her <strong>amazing sense of humor </strong>and <strong>contagious enthusiasm.</strong></p>
<p>We admire Melat’s: boundless <strong>generosity </strong>and <strong>kindness </strong>that extended beyond family and friends; <strong>intelligence </strong>and <strong>unmatched eloquence</strong> that left a lasting impression on anyone that crossed her path;<b> innate leadership </b>that made her the <b>defacto chief </b>in any circumstance; ability to put on<b> a brave face</b> even amidst the most trying of circumstances; and ability to be the <b>queen bee and worker bee</b> all at once during parties (we  fondly remember the countless times Melat bossed us around at parties, while she also worked tirelessly in the kitchen, leading the cleanup crew after weddings/events).</p>
<p>Melat was
many things to many people. We will
always remember her <strong>boundless energy, and love for life, family and friends</strong>. Her passing 90 days ago has
made our world colder and the sun dimmer. As we grapple with the loss of Melat,
her friends and classmates want to honor her life and all that she embodied. Those who knew Melat closely remember how
much she loved books; since childhood,  she was a voracious reader,
who continually strived to stretch her mind by reading all types of books.  </p>
<p>As a
tribute to Melat’s legacy and her love for books, we want to raise fund to
refurbish Nazareth School’s library – the school where Melat spent 12 years of
her childhood. The donation will be used
to physically expand the library and create a better system that would provide
better reading facility for the girls.  We
have $570 leftover from her memorial service but we want to raise <b><u>at least
100,000 birr.</u></b>   We kindly ask anyone who has been touched by Melat’s
life and wants to honor her to contribute to this cause and help us exceed this goal.  <strong><em><u>No contribution is too small so please donate whatever you can.</u></em></strong></p><p>Please free to write how you know Melat and
what she means to you…</p><p>The school would <strong>place a plaque (with Melat's picture,etc)</strong> in the Library in memory of Melat.</p>

Intro</h3>
<p>
Hello
there! </p>
<p>My
name is Iris Veldwijk and I'm currently a student at Maastricht
University, the Netherlands. My friends who have participated in the
Mongol Rally 2013
(<a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.theadventurists.com/the-adventures/mongol-rally</u></a>) inspired

Maastricht to London - where the official start is - and from London
to Ulan Baatar, Mongolia! A 15.555 kilometer journey for...</p>
<p>
CHARITY!</p>
<p>I
feel lucky to have grown up in a country where I got the same
educational opportunities as my male peers, but this is unfortunately
not the case for every girl who grows up. If girls in the developing
world receive education at all, it often ends before they become
adolescents. It will be your and my gift to impact and empower these
girls to become who they want to become and be on the forefront of
ending the perpetual cycle of poverty. The charity I'm running for is
The Girl Effect (<a href=""http://www.girleffect.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.girleffect.org/</u></a>),
because it suits the ideas described above. Updated will be on my
Facebook page: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MR2014IrisVeldwijk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.facebook.com/MR2014IrisVeldwijk</u></a></p>
<p>
Here's what's
going to happen:</p>
<p>
I'm
going to drive a car with a short life-span for European standards to
Mongolia, where it will be donated and live on for another couple of
decades. In the mean time, you and I will raise a load of money for
the charity, which will end up at the individuals who need it
(girls). I'll make a video diary of the 4-6 week trip, driving
through approximately 22 countries, taping all the happiness and
hardship that the car is going through, while rocking to YOUR MUSIC!
(see Perks!)</p>
<h3>
What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
There
are three ways in which you can help: donating physical materials
(see ""other ways you can help""), donating money (see
""perks"") and sharing this project on social media and to
people you know who might be willing to donate. If you know a company
that might want to sponsor big time and get advertising on the car,
you can send me an e-mail.</p>
<p>
The
funding I need at the very least is:</p>
<p>€1200
raised for charity (of course I hope to way go over this, and if I
raise a lot, I'll announce a second charity to divide the money over)</p>
<p>€540
entry fee (This is approximately 1/3 of last year's Mongol Rally
entry fee, without it I won't even start)</p>
<p>€900
fuel costs (16.000 km/14[km/L] × 0.80 [Average diesel price/L])</p>
<p>€800
Visas (10 visas in total)</p>
<p>
Once
this campaign is finished I'll start another one that focuses solely
on charity, but first I need to get this started. Because I love
transparent accounting, I'll keep a detailed log - published online -
of all the money that comes in to console all donors that the money
is going where they wanted it to go. Before and after Mongol Rally.</p>
<p>
See
the Perks for what your donation will get YOU!</p>
<p>
ALL
DONORS will get a shout-out from the Facebook page!</p>
<h3>
The
Impact</h3>
<p>
This
project is one very close to my heart and mind: I'm writing my
Bachelor's Thesis currently on girl's education. As much as I love
the academic, I only think my research is relevant if it has a real
world application. That's exactly why I'm raising the money for this
project. Come on board and let's impact and empower girls together!</p>

Other
Ways You Can Help</h3>

you can't contribute money, there are other ways to contribute to
this project; donating stuff. Here's a list of stuff you might have

Cruz, California, and have a BA in International Studies with a specialization in Central American Studies, and a Master of Arts in Communications with a specialization in Intercultural Communications, from Hawai'i Pacific University (HPU). To learn more about me and my endeavors visit <strong>my blog</strong>: <a href=""http://englishforbeachpurposes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://englishforbeachpurposes.blogspot.com/</a></p><p>Currently, I am enrolled in the Peace Corps Master International program of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (PCMI TESOL)  at the <a href=""http://www.miis.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monterey Institute of International Studies</a>  (MIIS), a graduate school of Middlebury College, located in Monterey, California.  As a <a href=""http://www.miis.edu/academics/programs/tesol/pcmi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PCMI TESOL candidate</a>, I depart January 23, of 2014 for Port Vila, Vanuatu, to begin my volunteer service with Project VITEL (Vanuatu Information Technology and English Literacy), eventually returning to Monterey in March of 2016.</p><p>As a Peace Corps Volunteer, my primary role will be English Literacy Trainer/Teacher, and I will be assigned to a primary school to support the Ministry of Education's Literacy Project with the intent ""of improving the quality of basic education by promoting the enhancement of teaching skills and methodologies, resulting in higher literacy levels and effective learning by students"" (Peace Corps, 2013).  Furthermore, Project VITEL aims to ""build up a strong literacy foundation in primary schools in order to improve dropping literacy rates throughout the country"" by providing training and support for professional and untrained teachers alike (ibid.).</p><p>As an English Literacy Trainer/Teacher, my focus will be to combine the teaching of phonics, and beginning reading/writing, to rural primary teachers and their students by hopefully integrating a CALL based approach (computer assisted language learning) <strong><em>where/when contextually appropriate</em></strong>, as more computers gradually find their way into the rural communities and schools of Vanuatu. </p><p>On the note of appropriateness, the implementation of such materials can be problematized from a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_discourse_analysis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">critical discursive point of view</a>. If you are interested in learning more about education in the colonial context, I highly recommend Paulo Freire's (1970) <em><a href=""http://www.users.humboldt.edu/jwpowell/edreformFriere_pedagogy.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</a>.</em>  With this in mind, the materials I will bring to Vanuatu are primarily for <strong><em>my discrete/discreet personal </em></strong>.  Thereafter, communal implementation is contingent upon the expressed desire of the community I will serve.  As such, when and if these materials will be integrated very prudently as my objective is not to provide ""hand outs"" to communities with limited resources, rather to teach them sustainable skills that can be enhanced or better facilitated by technologies when relevant and appropriate.</p><p>To see one of my related projects, visit <a href=""http://sites.miis.edu/eflhaiti/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sites.miis.edu/eflhaiti/</a> for more information on how technology can be integrated into the rural classroom using technologies.</p><p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p><p>As a pre-service Peace Corps Volunteer, <strong>Alphabet Soup Vanuatu: A campaign to feed the hunger of the literate mind</strong>, is my personal fundraising campaign intended to raise money to acquire pedagogical tools that will support my endeavors as a language educator volunteering with Project VITEL in rural Vanuatu.  </p><p>According to Peace Corps, ""virtually all primary schools in Vanuatu lack financial and material resources, which can be very challenging.  For example, you might arrive at school

Why</strong></p><p>According to UNICEF (2014) the GNI per capita is $2,870 US dollars (274,515 Vatus).  With this in mind, school fees in Vanuatu are 27,000 Vatus (the local currency) per child, per year.  Although this might not sound like much, the average family income in Vanuatu is $20,000 VT, and the average family has three children (81,000 Vatus), which means that a family could pay up to four months of their salary ($956.66 US) in school fees alone. </p><p>As well, schools in Vanuatu have limited resources, yet students are hungry for education.  In terms of human progress, societies at large are short-changed when capable and motivated learners miss out on learning opportunities.  In taking a view key resources to Vanuatu, I hope that I can afford learners opportunities that promote/enhance literacy and general education (e.g. DreamPlug with pathagar).  Furthermore, by supporting <strong>Alphabet Soup Vanuatu: A campaign to feed the hunger of the literate mind</strong>, your contribution will not only enhance general education in Vanuatu, but also help realize my dream of realizing children's' dreams by expanding their educational and literary opportunities, which, ultimately contributes to the creation of a more just, harmonious, sustainable, and literate existence.</p><p><strong>How You Can Take Action</strong></p><p>The students and communities of rural Vanuatu will benefit from your support!  A few helpful steps you could take might be:</p><p>1) Recruit 20 friends to make a modest contribution of $20 each.</p><p>2) Spread the word through Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, text, email, etc.</p><p>3) Learn more about Vanuatu and global educational/literacy needs.</p><p>As they say in Bislama... <strong><em>TANGKYU!</em></strong>  </p><p> </p></div>","BackgroundMy name is Patrick Dane Carson and I am a pre-service Peace Corps Volunteer.  I am from Santa Cruz, California, and have a BA in International Studies with a specialization in Central American Studies, and a Master of Arts in Communications with a specialization in Intercultural Communications, from Hawai'i Pacific University (HPU). To learn more about me and my endeavors visit my blog: http://englishforbeachpurposes.blogspot.com/Currently, I am enrolled in the Peace Corps Master International program of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (PCMI TESOL)  at the Monterey Institute of International Studies  (MIIS), a graduate school of Middlebury College, located in Monterey, California.  As a PCMI TESOL candidate, I depart January 23, of 2014 for Port Vila, Vanuatu, to begin my volunteer service with Project VITEL (Vanuatu Information Technology and English Literacy), eventually returning to Monterey in March of 2016.As a Peace Corps Volunteer, my primary role will be English Literacy Trainer/Teacher, and I will be assigned to a primary school to support the Ministry of Education's Literacy Project with the intent ""of improving the quality of basic education by promoting the enhancement of teaching skills and methodologies, resulting in higher literacy levels and effective learning by students"" (Peace Corps, 2013).  Furthermore, Project VITEL aims to ""build up a strong literacy foundation in primary schools in order to improve dropping literacy rates throughout the country"" by providing training and support for professional and untrained teachers alike (ibid.).As an English Literacy Trainer/Teacher, my focus will be to combine the teaching of phonics, and beginning reading/writing, to rural primary teachers and their students by hopefully integrating a CALL based approach (computer assisted language learning) where/when contextually appropriate, as more computers gradually find their way into the rural communities and schools of Vanuatu. On the note of appropriateness, the implementation of such materials can be problematized from a critical discursive point of view. If you are interested in learning more about education in the colonial context, I highly recommend Paulo Freire's (1970) Pedagogy of the Oppressed.  With this in mind, the materials I will bring to Vanuatu are primarily for my discrete/discreet personal .  Thereafter, communal implementation is contingent upon the expressed desire of the community I will serve.  As such, when and if these materials will be integrated very prudently as my objective is not to provide ""hand outs"" to communities with limited resources, rather to teach them sustainable skills that can be enhanced or better facilitated by technologies when relevant and appropriate.To see one of my related projects, visit http://sites.miis.edu/eflhaiti/ for more information on how technology can be integrated into the rural classroom using technologies.The CampaignAs a pre-service Peace Corps Volunteer, Alphabet Soup Vanuatu: A campaign to feed the hunger of the literate mind, is my personal fundraising campaign intended to raise money to acquire pedagogical tools that will support my endeavors as a language educator volunteering with Project VITEL in rural Vanuatu.  According to Peace Corps, ""virtually all primary schools in Vanuatu lack financial and material resources, which can be very challenging.  For example, you might arrive at school only to find that you have no text books, or that what you do have is in poor condition or out of date"" (2013, p. 9).  Additionally, the lack of resources such as paper, writing utensils, electricity, and internet pose a challenge to volunteers.  Best put in Peace Corps' Project VITEL assignment handbook, ""regardless of your assignment you will undoubtedly experience some hardships and perhaps some frustration.  You will have to tap into your own creative and problem solving abilities in order to find your place in the school community and make a positive contribution"" (2013, p. 9).With a little foresight as a pre-service volunteer, this campaign is an attempt to creatively solve the problems posed by the lack of pedagogical resources.  As such, I have come up with a wish-list of useful resources for rural education that will mitigate some of the infrastructural/geographic challenges faced by educators in rural communities.  With this in mind, I hope to raise money so that I can acquire useful teaching tools that will allow me to better serve my future students and community.The Wish List The following list provides information about each resource that I will purchase will the funds raised by this campaign, their intended use, and the approximate cost.  I have inserted links that provide more information about each item.  Furthermore, I will document the implementation of these tools on my blog (which is almost ready to launch).1)

</p><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><b>Amaro Kher = our
house</b><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Project 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Amaro Kher is
a project of three non-profit-organisations from Germany. It all
started with a school project in Kriva Palanka. One of the
organisations rent a house to give the people in the poor Romani
neighborhood in Macedonia the chance to bring their kids to
kindergarden and to help them prepare for school. The goal of the
project Amaro Kher is assistance for self-help . The house is
supposed to be a community center, where the neighborhood can
organize themselves, learn something, build something. In the end the
Roma shall administrate it by themselves independently from the
german supporters. The architecture is not convential but more a
modern one with recycling techniques. We use clay and recycling
materials such as plastic bottles and car tires for the construction.
People of the neighborhood can also learn these recycling building
techniques for repairing their own houses. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/481842/files/20140403132636-555531_574764725910512_64503947_n.jpg?1396556796"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We work
closely together with a group of the neighborhood (picture), which we call the
„AmaroKher- Contact-group“. They are like the representatives for
the neighborhood and will administrate the house in the future.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/481377/files/20140403101912-1379765_568365039883600_1249865955_n.jpg?1396545552"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The house
could be bought because we had one big donator who paid for it. The
first construction episode last summer was financed with money which
we collected from concerts, school donations and asking and asking
and asking people to give something.We have almost enough money now
to build the rest of the house but when the house is done we will
need more money. 
</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>For what do
we need money ?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Most urgently
we need money for the furniture and for things in the house. The
contact group would like to build a workshop room downstairs where
people can fix their things and use tools. We also want to buy some
computers for work and education. Also toys for the kids are a big
subject: they dont really have toys to play with. Also we would like
to hire a teacher for the kids in school to help them with their
homework. The kids have a lot of problems in school because at home
they speak Romani and do not learn the national language. So they
urgently need help to stay in school and get an exam.</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/481811/files/20140403131530-644486_568362859883818_1213190343_n.jpg?1396556130"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We could
realize a lot there, but it all costs money. Therefore, I did not do
a fix goal with the money. We will do what we can with what we have.
And if we had enough money at the end we even could provide some jobs
for the people there... but that are really future dreams

</p><p><b>Who am I</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is
Hanna, i am a lawyer in training and mediator and became part of the
project at the beginning of 2013. My mother is the initiator of the
project and so I found my way to this special project. When my mom
became cancer last year I took over some dutys for the project and
was in Kriva Palanka two times last year. Mostly for the contact
group to help them organize themselves and prepare them for their
administrative duties in the future.

<p>
</p><p><b>The children</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Most important
for me personally are the perspectives (even if its small) we can
give to the children and the young people in Kriva Palanka. They have
got a troubled start in life and its just not fair. Some of them are
so poor that even a broken arm cant be fixed because they have no
health insurance and no money. And in school and public they are
treated very racially sometimes (we could not even get in to the open
air pool with the kids: „No Romas“ they said). But the kids are
willing, they are strong, intelligent and eager to learn things...
that we saw at the construction. They want to be part of the project
so much that they even fight for a hammer even if the work was only
to pull nails out of the wood from the old house.

<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We and the
contact group want to give them the opportunity to learn and build
something. For that we want to give them space, things and help for
homework. We want to give them the opportunity to do sport things (by
buying theme some toys like skateboards and books to borrow for free)
and music instruments (there are some talented ones I think).</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/481387/files/20140403102101-1240316_542019225851515_577256242_n.jpg?1396545661"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The german group</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The group of
the German volunteers is very... individual I would say. We're a big
group with about 40 people, Age between 14- 60 years, very different
backgrounds, jobs and opinions...Last summer it was a coming and
going of Germans all along. But as a network we work together very
well. Even if its not easy sometimes. All members in all the german
groups, the contact group, the kids and the rest of the neighborhood
became one big crazy family.

house

The Project 


Amaro Kher is
a project of three non-profit-organisations from Germany. It all
started with a school project in Kriva Palanka. One of the
organisations rent a house to give the people in the poor Romani
neighborhood in Macedonia the chance to bring their kids to
kindergarden and to help them prepare for school. The goal of the
project Amaro Kher is assistance for self-help . The house is
supposed to be a community center, where the neighborhood can
organize themselves, learn something, build something. In the end the
Roma shall administrate it by themselves independently from the
german supporters. The architecture is not convential but more a
modern one with recycling techniques. We use clay and recycling
materials such as plastic bottles and car tires for the construction.
People of the neighborhood can also learn these recycling building
techniques for repairing their own houses. 



We work
closely together with a group of the neighborhood (picture), which we call the
„AmaroKher- Contact-group“. They are like the representatives for
the neighborhood and will administrate the house in the future.

The house
could be bought because we had one big donator who paid for it. The
first construction episode last summer was financed with money which
we collected from concerts, school donations and asking and asking
and asking people to give something.We have almost enough money now
to build the rest of the house but when the house is done we will
need more money. 



For what do
we need money ?

Most urgently
we need money for the furniture and for things in the house. The
contact group would like to build a workshop room downstairs where
people can fix their things and use tools. We also want to buy some
computers for work and education. Also toys for the kids are a big
subject: they dont really have toys to play with. Also we would like
to hire a teacher for the kids in school to help them with their
homework. The kids have a lot of problems in school because at home
they speak Romani and do not learn the national language. So they
urgently need help to stay in school and get an exam.


We could
realize a lot there, but it all costs money. Therefore, I did not do
a fix goal with the money. We will do what we can with what we have.
And if we had enough money at the end we even could provide some jobs
for the people there... but that are really future dreams 




Who am I
My name is
Hanna, i am a lawyer in training and mediator and became part of the
project at the beginning of 2013. My mother is the initiator of the
project and so I found my way to this special project. When my mom
became cancer last year I took over some dutys for the project and
was in Kriva Palanka two times last year. Mostly for the contact
group to help them organize themselves and prepare them for their
administrative duties in the future. 
(my mom )(me)

The children
Most important
for me personally are the perspectives (even if its small) we can
give to the children and the young people in Kriva Palanka. They have
got a troubled start in life and its just not fair. Some of them are
so poor that even a broken arm cant be fixed because they have no
health insurance and no money. And in school and public they are
treated very racially sometimes (we could not even get in to the open
air pool with the kids: „No Romas“ they said). But the kids are
willing, they are strong, intelligent and eager to learn things...
that we saw at the construction. They want to be part of the project
so much that they even fight for a hammer even if the work was only
to pull nails out of the wood from the old house. 


We and the
contact group want to give them the opportunity to learn and build
something. For that we want to give them space, things and help for
homework. We want to give them the opportunity to do sport things (by
buying theme some toys like skateboards and books to borrow for free)
and music instruments (there are some talented ones I think).


The german group
The group of
the German volunteers is very... individual I would say. We're a big
group with about 40 people, Age between 14- 60 years, very different
backgrounds, jobs and opinions...Last summer it was a coming and
going of Germans all along. But as a network we work together very
well. Even if its not easy sometimes. All members in all the german
groups, the contact group, the kids and the rest of the neighborhood
became one big crazy family. 
(part of the crazy family)(german group and roma-contact-group at planning)(the big boys are our architects)

<div>Samuel R. Delany is one of the most brilliant, stimulating, and uncompromising writers on the contemporary American literary scene.  As a gay African-American author who has produced exuberantly innovative work in a variety of genres -- science fiction preeminent among them -- Delany has won the admiration of legions of readers.  Over the course of his half-century career, Delany's writing has garnered numerous awards and honors, including four Nebula Awards and two Hugo Awards, a Lambda Literary Award, the Bill Whitehead Memorial Award for a Lifetime Contribution to Lesbian and Gay Literature, and inclusion in the prestigious <i>Norton Anthology of African American Literature</i>.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Currently I am compiling and editing Delany’s personal journals.  The journals will be published by Wesleyan University Press in what is projected to be a series of at least five volumes, with each volume covering approximately one decade’s worth of material.  I have recently completed the first volume, <i>In Search of Silence</i>; this volume is now in the final stages of production at Wesleyan and is slated to appear at the end of this year. It covers the period from Delany’s teenage years in the late 1950s to the end of the 1960s, during which time Delany established himself as a major figure in what came to be called New Wave science fiction.  The second volume, <i>Autumnal City</i>, will present Delany’s journals from the 1970s, during which time he wrote the bulk of what many consider the pivotal work of his career, <i>Dhalgren</i> (1975), as well as <i>Trouble on Triton</i> (1976), the first volume of the Nevèrÿon tetralogy (<i>Tales of Nevèrÿon</i> [1979]), and many works of criticism.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In this campaign I am seeking funding to produce the second volume.  If I secure this funding, the project – which involves researching, compiling, transcribing, editing, and annotating the text – will take two years to complete.  The total amount I am seeking, for two years of full-time work on the project, is $60,000.  This will cover three areas: personal expenses, expenses associated with the project (travel, office expenses, and so on), and expenses associated with this campaign (fees and percentages, cost and shipping of rewards, and so on).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Funds raised in this campaign will not go to Wesleyan University Press, but rather directly to me, in support of my scholarly labor.  In academic publishing, the primary income of the author comes not from the publisher through book advances or sales, but rather from a university paycheck (and usually the author and publisher are affiliated with different universities).  If the author is an independent scholar, as I am, then that primary income is understood to come from some other external source.  For this project, <i>you</i> will be that source.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why You Should Sponsor This Project</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>It's important.</h4>
<p>The release of Delany’s personal journals will add thousands of pages to Delany’s published work and reveal a major new dimension of his writing.  The journals will be of great interest to Delany’s readers in particular, and to all readers concerned with the personal development of a writer and thinker whose work has focused on issues of sexuality, race, and social marginality.  By supporting this project you will contribute directly to the important project of getting Delany’s journals out into the world.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>I'm qualified.</h4>
<p>I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from Cornell University and received my MFA in Film and Media Arts from Temple University and my Ph.D. in English from SUNY Buffalo.  I have published five scholarly essays on Delany’s work, including introductions to two of his books: <i>Longer Views</i> (1995) – also from Wesleyan – and <i>1984: Selected Letters</i> (1999).  In 2005 I organized the first international conference devoted to Delany’s work, several papers from which were later published in a special “Delany” issue of the academic quarterly <i>Annals of Scholarship</i>, for which I served as Guest Editor.  I also contributed an essay to Wesleyan’s recent critical edition of Delany’s novel <i>Phallos</i> (2013).   In short, having made a life project of studying and explicating Delany’s writing, I am uniquely qualified to carry out this project.  </p>
<p></p>
<h4>It's a sure thing.</h4>
<p>As I said above, I’ve already completed the first volume. It’s done! (And I should mention that the folks at Wesleyan, and Delany himself, are very satisfied with my work, and support this campaign wholeheartedly.) The completion of the first volume means that there are no major unknowns involved in the process of completing the second: all key questions about archival sources, editorial methods, and the organization and presentation of material have now been answered.  (Indeed, one reason I didn't run a crowdfunding campaign for the first volume was that I wanted to be sure, in running such a campaign, that I was making a promise I knew I could keep.  And now I am sure.)  Thus, donating to <i>Autumnal City</i> requires no special leap of faith on your part: if you fund it, it will get done.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Time is of the essence.</h4>
<p>My ability to work full-time on <i>Autumnal City</i> will directly enhance the quality of the volume, and for a specific reason.  While compiling the first volume I was fortunate to have Delany himself on hand to answer my countless questions on matters not covered by his own autobiographical work or other secondary sources.  This enriched the volume hugely, and needless to say, I want to preserve this working relationship for future volumes. But – to be blunt – Delany is not getting any younger. Producing these volumes as quickly as is practicable will help ensure Delany’s continued participation.  Thus, by supporting full-time work on the second volume, you will help improve the volume – and, with luck, improve the quality of volumes to come.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3> <p></p>
<p>To add momentum (and some extra enjoyment) to the campaign, I have added rewards for different levels of donation.  Each successive level includes the rewards given for the previous levels.  All rewards are, of course, optional; donors can forgo them if they wish.  (Also, note that two <i>new</i> rewards have been added to the line-up since the campaign began.)</p>
<p></p>
<h4>""Singer""</h4>
<div>Donors at this level ($10) will receive updates on the project every six months.  These periods will cover the four major phases of the project: compilation, transcription, editing, and annotation.  I may supplement the updates with news of other interesting developments related to the project, if and when they occur.  If 6,000 of Delany's readers donate at this level, the campaign goal will be reached.<br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<h4>""Scorpion""</h4>
<p>Donors at this level ($60) will receive what is, in my view, the most purely fun reward of the lot: a Samuel Delany T-shirt.  The photographer Becket Logan has given me permission to use his striking photo portrait of Delany, with graphic enhancement, as the basis for the shirt.  Readers of <i>Dhalgren </i>may think of the shirt as a set of Scorpion chains: by this garment Delany fans everywhere will be able to recognize one another.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464808096/greytee2_xj312s.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 479.00000000000006px;height: 445px;""/></p>
<br/><p>I have pegged the minimum donation for this reward at $60, because if I receive 1,000 such donations, the campaign goal will be met.  So the implicit question this reward poses is: are there 1,000 Delany readers out there willing to donate $60 to this project?  I suspect there are.  Perhaps you are one of them.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>""Liberator""</h4>
<p>Donors at this level ($100 and above) will be listed (if they so desire) on a special Acknowledgments page in <i>Autumnal City</i>.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;"">""Liberator Plus"" </span></p>First of two new perks here!  Donors at this level ($100 and above) will receive all the preceding rewards (notifications, shirt, acknowledgments), <i>plus</i> a hardcover copy of either <i>In Search of Silence</i> (Volume One) or <i>Autumnal City</i> (Volume Two).  Your choice.  Bear in mind that <i>In Search of Silence</i> is projected to hit the bookstores at the end of this year, while <i>Autumnal City</i> will take a few more years to appear physically.  (Note also that because this new perk is pegged at the same donation value as the earlier one, donors who have already given a ""Liberator""-level donation will, unless they specify otherwise, receive the rewards of the ""Liberator-Plus"" level.  Yes, you get a book!)</div><div><b><h4>""Sygn""</h4></b></div><div>Second of two new perks!  Donors at this level ($200) will receive the preceding rewards, plus hardcover copies of both <i>In Search of Silence</i> and <i>Autumnal City</i>. Again, bear in mind that the two volumes will be released at different times.</div><div><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;""><h4>""Golden""</h4></span></div><div>Donors at this level ($500 and above) will receive a hardcover copy of <i>In Search of Silence, </i>signed by Delany.<i>  </i>At present I am offering only 20 copies, but will add more if this reward receives a strong response.  <p></p>
<h4>If the Funding Goal is Exceeded</h4>
<p>If the total donations exceed the campaign goal of $60,000, then the extra funds will go directly toward work on the third volume.  Potential donors may take this as an incentive to be generous, since, unless budgeting needs change, any funding the third volume receives now should help reduce the funding needs for that volume later.  And if I may indulge in a little speculative fiction: if, during the current campaign, a full $60,000 becomes available for the <i>third</i> volume, then any funds raised beyond that will be put toward the <i>fourth </i>volume...<i> </i>and so on.  (Note also: if the funding goal is reached before the campaign ends, anyone making a ""Liberator""-level donation after that point will be listed on the Acknowledgments page for the third volume rather than the second -- so those who would like to be listed in the second volume should donate early.)</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Previews</h3> <p> </p>To whet your appetite for <i>Autumnal City</i>, I have secured permission from Wesleyan to present some material associated with the first volume, <i>In Search of Silence</i>. Here’s the cover:</div><div>

</div><p>As you can see, it’s a handsome volume, and the series as a whole is going to make an impressive set.  The cover image, incidentally, shows a portion of a sculpture by Dame Barbara Hepworth called “Orpheus (Maquette 2) (Version II).”  Delany’s readers will recognize this as an appropriate image for the period of his career covered in the first volume.</p><p>Next, some endorsements for <i>In Search of Silence</i>:</p><p>“Mesmerizing . . . a true portrait of an artist as a young Black man . . . already visible in these pages are the wit, sensitivity, penetration, playfulness and the incandescent intelligence that will characterize Delany and his extraordinary work.”</p><p>—Junot Díaz, author of <i>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</i></p><p>“This is a tremendously significant and vital addition to the oeuvre of Samuel Delany;

Samuel R. Delany is one of the most brilliant, stimulating, and uncompromising writers on the contemporary American literary scene.  As a gay African-American author who has produced exuberantly innovative work in a variety of genres -- science fiction preeminent among them -- Delany has won the admiration of legions of readers.  Over the course of his half-century career, Delany's writing has garnered numerous awards and honors, including four Nebula Awards and two Hugo Awards, a Lambda Literary Award, the Bill Whitehead Memorial Award for a Lifetime Contribution to Lesbian and Gay Literature, and inclusion in the prestigious Norton Anthology of African American Literature.  

Currently I am compiling and editing Delany’s personal journals.  The journals will be published by Wesleyan University Press in what is projected to be a series of at least five volumes, with each volume covering approximately one decade’s worth of material.  I have recently completed the first volume, In Search of Silence; this volume is now in the final stages of production at Wesleyan and is slated to appear at the end of this year. It covers the period from Delany’s teenage years in the late 1950s to the end of the 1960s, during which time Delany established himself as a major figure in what came to be called New Wave science fiction.  The second volume, Autumnal City, will present Delany’s journals from the 1970s, during which time he wrote the bulk of what many consider the pivotal work of his career, Dhalgren (1975), as well as Trouble on Triton (1976), the first volume of the Nevèrÿon tetralogy (Tales of Nevèrÿon [1979]), and many works of criticism.

In this campaign I am seeking funding to produce the second volume.  If I secure this funding, the project – which involves researching, compiling, transcribing, editing, and annotating the text – will take two years to complete.  The total amount I am seeking, for two years of full-time work on the project, is $60,000.  This will cover three areas: personal expenses, expenses associated with the project (travel, office expenses, and so on), and expenses associated with this campaign (fees and percentages, cost and shipping of rewards, and so on).

Funds raised in this campaign will not go to Wesleyan University Press, but rather directly to me, in support of my scholarly labor.  In academic publishing, the primary income of the author comes not from the publisher through book advances or sales, but rather from a university paycheck (and usually the author and publisher are affiliated with different universities).  If the author is an independent scholar, as I am, then that primary income is understood to come from some other external source.  For this project, you will be that source.

   Why You Should Sponsor This Project

It's important.
The release of Delany’s personal journals will add thousands of pages to Delany’s published work and reveal a major new dimension of his writing.  The journals will be of great interest to Delany’s readers in particular, and to all readers concerned with the personal development of a writer and thinker whose work has focused on issues of sexuality, race, and social marginality.  By supporting this project you will contribute directly to the important project of getting Delany’s journals out into the world.

I'm qualified.
I graduated summa cum laude from Cornell University and received my MFA in Film and Media Arts from Temple University and my Ph.D. in English from SUNY Buffalo.  I have published five scholarly essays on Delany’s work, including introductions to two of his books: Longer Views (1995) – also from Wesleyan – and 1984: Selected Letters (1999).  In 2005 I organized the first international conference devoted to Delany’s work, several papers from which were later published in a special “Delany” issue of the academic quarterly Annals of Scholarship, for which I served as Guest Editor.  I also contributed an essay to Wesleyan’s recent critical edition of Delany’s novel Phallos (2013).   In short, having made a life project of studying and explicating Delany’s writing, I am uniquely qualified to carry out this project.  

It's a sure thing.
As I said above, I’ve already completed the first volume. It’s done! (And I should mention that the folks at Wesleyan, and Delany himself, are very satisfied with my work, and support this campaign wholeheartedly.) The completion of the first volume means that there are no major unknowns involved in the process of completing the second: all key questions about archival sources, editorial methods, and the organization and presentation of material have now been answered.  (Indeed, one reason I didn't run a crowdfunding campaign for the first volume was that I wanted to be sure, in running such a campaign, that I was making a promise I knew I could keep.  And now I am sure.)  Thus, donating to Autumnal City requires no special leap of faith on your part: if you fund it, it will get done.

Time is of the essence.
My ability to work full-time on Autumnal City will directly enhance the quality of the volume, and for a specific reason.  While compiling the first volume I was fortunate to have Delany himself on hand to answer my countless questions on matters not covered by his own autobiographical work or other secondary sources.  This enriched the volume hugely, and needless to say, I want to preserve this working relationship for future volumes. But – to be blunt – Delany is not getting any younger. Producing these volumes as quickly as is practicable will help ensure Delany’s continued participation.  Thus, by supporting full-time work on the second volume, you will help improve the volume – and, with luck, improve the quality of volumes to come.


Perks 
To add momentum (and some extra enjoyment) to the campaign, I have added rewards for different levels of donation.  Each successive level includes the rewards given for the previous levels.  All rewards are, of course, optional; donors can forgo them if they wish.  (Also, note that two new rewards have been added to the line-up since the campaign began.)

""Singer""
Donors at this level ($10) will receive updates on the project every six months.  These periods will cover the four major phases of the project: compilation, transcription, editing, and annotation.  I may supplement the updates with news of other interesting developments related to the project, if and when they occur.  If 6,000 of Delany's readers donate at this level, the campaign goal will be reached.


""Scorpion""
Donors at this level ($60) will receive what is, in my view, the most purely fun reward of the lot: a Samuel Delany T-shirt.  The photographer Becket Logan has given me permission to use his striking photo portrait of Delany, with graphic enhancement, as the basis for the shirt.  Readers of Dhalgren may think of the shirt as a set of Scorpion chains: by this garment Delany fans everywhere will be able to recognize one another.


I have pegged the minimum donation for this reward at $60, because if I receive 1,000 such donations, the campaign goal will be met.  So the implicit question this reward poses is: are there 1,000 Delany readers out there willing to donate $60 to this project?  I suspect there are.  Perhaps you are one of them.

""Liberator""
Donors at this level ($100 and above) will be listed (if they so desire) on a special Acknowledgments page in Autumnal City.
""Liberator Plus"" First of two new perks here!  Donors at this level ($100 and above) will receive all the preceding rewards (notifications, shirt, acknowledgments), plus a hardcover copy of either In Search of Silence (Volume One) or Autumnal City (Volume Two).  Your choice.  Bear in mind that In Search of Silence is projected to hit the bookstores at the end of this year, while Autumnal City will take a few more years to appear physically.  (Note also that because this new perk is pegged at the same donation value as the earlier one, donors who have already given a ""Liberator""-level donation will, unless they specify otherwise, receive the rewards of the ""Liberator-Plus"" level.  Yes, you get a book!)""Sygn""Second of two new perks!  Donors at this level ($200) will receive the preceding rewards, plus hardcover copies of both In Search of Silence and Autumnal City. Again, bear in mind that the two volumes will be released at different times.""Golden""Donors at this level ($500 and above) will receive a hardcover copy of In Search of Silence, signed by Delany.  At present I am offering only 20 copies, but will add more if this reward receives a strong response.  
If the Funding Goal is Exceeded
If the total donations exceed the campaign goal of $60,000, then the extra funds will go directly toward work on the third volume.  Potential donors may take this as an incentive to be generous, since, unless budgeting needs change, any funding the third volume receives now should help reduce the funding needs for that volume later.  And if I may indulge in a little speculative fiction: if, during the current campaign, a full $60,000 becomes available for the third volume, then any funds raised beyond that will be put toward the fourth volume... and so on.  (Note also: if the funding goal is reached before the campaign ends, anyone making a ""Liberator""-level donation after that point will be listed on the Acknowledgments page for the third volume rather than the second -- so those who would like to be listed in the second volume should donate early.)
   Previews  To whet your appetite for Autumnal City, I have secured permission from Wesleyan to present some material associated with the first volume, In Search of Silence. Here’s the cover:

  
As you can see, it’s a handsome volume, and the series as a whole is going to make an impressive set.  The cover image, incidentally, shows a portion of a sculpture by Dame Barbara Hepworth called “Orpheus (Maquette 2) (Version II).”  Delany’s readers will recognize this as an appropriate image for the period of his career covered in the first volume.Next, some endorsements for In Search of Silence:“Mesmerizing . . . a true portrait of an artist as a young Black man . . . already visible in these pages are the wit, sensitivity, penetration, playfulness and the incandescent intelligence that will characterize Delany and his extraordinary work.”—Junot Díaz, author of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao“This is a tremendously significant and vital addition to the oeuvre of Samuel Delany; it clarifies questions not only of the writer’s process, but also his development—to see, in his juvenilia, traces that take full form in his novels—is literally breathtaking.”—Matthew Cheney, author of Blood: Stories“These journals give us the very rare experience of being able to watch genius escaping from the chrysalis.”—Jo Walton, author of Among OthersFinally, here are a few paragraphs from the early pages of the volume, part of a longer entry Delany wrote when he was a seventeen-year-old high school student in New York City.  Enjoy.…It was hot with people, and in the bus you have to strain to reach over [the] old lady's shoulders so that you can grab the strap, and when you finally get back where there are not enough people to be uncomfortably crowded and too many to feel free (and my coat was for the brittle winter air outside, not the effluvia of body heat that bloats up a crowded bus) you can reach a fair sort of balance between agony and simple displeasure.  The back seat of the bus runs from one side to the other.  The rest are placed either in rows along the side or (in those places just over the wheels) with the seat backs to the wall so that the people in them must stare straight across the aisle into the dull faces of those people perched above the other wheel who are staring back.There was a boy in the back seat, with a blue zipper jacket on – he was near fourteen.  He had good hands;

<h3>Guate - Guate - Guatemala! </h3>
<p>In May, I got an amazing opportunity to study abroad during Maymester with CU Denver in San Lucas Toliman, Guatemala. We stayed at Pavarotti Education Center and got to work with the students. During our first day there we were taken on a tour of the school and got to walk through the classrooms and library. Being a future teacher the tour made me very emotional, and those aspects stuck out the most to me. The students are in need of books. They have a library that has a small supply. They are teaching the students English with Shakespeare poetry because they have no other option.  Before I left to come home I knew that I wanted to do something about what I saw. I believe that every child deserves an education no matter what their background is.</p>
<p>While we were at the school we took place in a cultural exchange with the students and taught them the Cha Cha Slide while they taught us a dance of their own. It was such an incredible time teaching each other our dances and then dancing together in front of the school. We were able to communicate great even with the language barrier. Some of the words in the Cha Cha Slide tell you to reverse, and then reverse again. That is why my fundraiser has the name that it does.</p>
<h3>Lack of books - Why should you help?</h3>
<p>Guatemala is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. 75% of the population lives below poverty line, and 58% lives below the extreme poverty line. 60% are illiterate in indigenous population and 75% are illiterate in rural areas. Families make on average $4 a day. Indigenous Mayans make up half population and account for less than a quarter of the income/ consumption. </p>
<p>Two-thirds of the children are in poverty. The average schooling is 4 years and THREE out of 10 graduate 6th grade. “In 2007, only 63% of boys and 64% of girls enrolled in Primary school reached the final grade of Primary education,” (UNESCO Institute for Statistics). 9 out of 10 schools lack books and 1 out of 10 rural Guatemalan children even get opportunity to attend school. </p>
<p>Schools are poorly funded, don’t have adequate teaching materials, lack adequate books, teaching guides, literacy materials and teachers are not trained properly. Many children cannot stay in school; they have to drop out to support their families, they cannot afford uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation. School is free but the fees are too high. </p>
<p>The “Civil War” has a lot to do with education lacking – Mayans are still excluded from benefits of the country and still remain targets of racism and exclusion from land, labor, and education. When your country is being attacked, reading seems less important.</p>

I am a creative, intelligent, hard-working casualty of the new economy, who got a Bachelor's Degree in 2004 from San Francisco State and went to work as an office jockey for a non-profit. After a couple failed entry-level jobs, I went solo. I've managed to scrape by that way, but I know things could be much better for me, so I went searching outside of my city. While finding steady work in the USA has been all but impossible, I've already secured a job teaching English in Taiwan to begin in July.

I am a creative, intelligent, hard-working casualty of the new economy, who got a Bachelor's Degree in 2004 from San Francisco State and went to work as an office jockey for a non-profit. After a couple failed entry-level jobs, I went solo. I've managed to scrape by that way, but I know things could be much better for me, so I went searching outside of my city. While finding steady work in the USA has been all but impossible, I've already secured a job teaching English in Taiwan to begin in July.

</p><p><b>Why
Me?</b></p>
<p>Hello!
Thanks for stopping by my campaign. My name is Sophie and I am a junior
Environmental Design major studying at the Maryland Institute College of Art.
If you have kids, or know someone who does, then you know college is expensive!
I am very lucky to be able to go to such an amazing art school in Baltimore
Maryland. However at this point the college funds (aka the rents) are pretty
tapped out. So I must turn to the Internet! I have a great opportunity to study
abroad in Peru for three weeks this summer but it is rather on the pricey side.
I chose to crowd source for this chance because I think there are a lot of
other students like me who are scared to step out and ask for help. We all have
personal goals and things we would like to do, and without one another we
cannot accomplish those goals. Personally, I have always wanted to see Machu
Picchu in person. As a design student I cannot think of a more powerful example
of lasting and genius design than the terraces that the Inca built over 500
years ago. If my campaign is funded not only will I be able to go to Machu
Picchu but I will be able to travel all over southern Peru and have invaluable
experiences. Please take a minute to check out my perks and support me if you
can!</p>
<p>I
am relying mostly on my photography skills for these perks, to check out my
photography works and my other design/ artwork please go to my website <a href=""http://cargocollective.com/sophiestoerkel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cargocollective.com/sophiestoerkel</a></p>

<p>The history of our project starts with a young mother, Laurie, who was
experiencing increasing concern with her children's education. Teachers and principals offered little help.  Determined to give her children the best education
she could, she discovered and researched the Montessori Method.  <b>This
method centers on the ideal that education should be an aid for the children's
future life, helping children to be independent and to love learning.  </b></p>
<p>
With a three-month baby in tow, Laurie studied and trained, receiving her
Montessori certification. She has now been teaching for over 30
years and is a leading expert on the Montessori Method.  In 2003 she
opened a Montessori school in her own home in Idaho and in 2005 Laurie founded
Lighthouse Montessori School. Laurie also established a Montessori Teacher Training
Center, where she has prepared and instructed many future Montessori
teachers.   <b>Still firmly dedicated to the principles of
family and education that motivated her as a young mother, Laurie's vision is to
create the Lighthouse Montessori Farm School that will be an ideal learning
environment for children and will also be a place for families and the
community to experience the joy of both working and celebrating the land.  </b></p>

 On April 26, we (Louise, Xavier and Thomas) are running Scotia Bank's 21k run in 
Montreal. This is a great opportunity to raise money for a good cause!<br/> <br/> Indigo is an association based in 
Nice, south of France. It organizes events 
(magicians, clowns, painting for mom/dad's day of course, cinema 
workshops... the good life!) and trips for kids who suffer from cancer. 
Because the association is directly linked to the Centre Universitaire Hospitalier de Nice (public hospital), it also pays for the training of the nurses and carers of the hospital.<br/> <br/>
 These people are truly amazing, always in a good mood, incredibly 
dedicated, great confidants and unshakable support to the kids!<br/> <br/>
 If you feel in a generous mood or feel concerned by this cause, we need your help! Please 
donate! Any amount between $5 or $15 will do. If you are overflowing with philanthropy, don't be afraid to give more! And if you don't want to donate no
