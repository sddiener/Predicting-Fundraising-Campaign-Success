<h3>What is 45 Story and the Always Be Here For You Campaign?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>My name is Keith Pulvermacher. I was raised around music and I have always known that I have a larger purpose than only making music. Music is the platform I have been given in order to make the world a better place. Back in 2014 I released my debut record called Midwestern. With your support I was able to give $2000.00 back to an organization called ' I Back Jack' to help support resources to fight childhood cancer. Making the best possible music I can is extremely important to me. Doing everything I can to give back and to be here for those who need it also means the world to me. Whatever is raised through this campaign merely shows how much you want to support the vision and the music. I am grateful for your participation and the money raised will be going towards a purpose bigger than me.</p>
<p>This time I wanted to try help even more people with the creation of this record. I have decided to create and launch a charity campaign as well in conjunction with the release of this record. I am giving my song, 'Always Be Here For You' to 12 different charities over the course of a one year period. I have also engaged corporate sponsors to get involved with the charity campaign. Each sponsor has committed to give one of the charities $5000.00 directly. Each month, 100% of donations from everyone who downloads the song will be given to the charity of that month. The charity campaign also required a separate website and design that had to be built to accomodate all of the charities and business's involved. That separate website will be launched January 1st, 2019.  I have spent most of my time working on creating and developing both of these projects this year. I have amazingly talented friends who believe in my vision and have offered their help as well. None of us do this alone.</p>
<p>I believe the gifts I have been given are to serve others. I believe we all have a responsibility to do what we can to take care of each other. Some of us have vision, some of us have time, some of us have resources and money, some of us have talents, some of us just need help. When you support this campaign, you are supporting my ability to create new music as well as my ability to make and raise money and resources for people with Cancer, Juvenile Diabetes, Autism, Alzheimer's, Melanoma, FMD, among other causes that get involved. Just to be clear, the first project, '45 Story', will be released December 28th, 2018. The second project, the 'Always Be Here For You' charity campaign and website will be launched January 1st, 2019.</p>
<p>We all have a story. We all find ourselves at times in life where we need a hand. I make music. The costs of making a good record are expensive. The costs of creating this charity campaign have proven to be expensive as well. I know how important this work is and your support helps beyond measure. Thank You so much! I hope you love the record. I hope you understand that I know I am just a piece of the puzzle. I appreciate your time and your help in order to make all of this happen. I believe if we can...we should.</p>
<p>All my Love,</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The funding and the costs of the project:</p>
<p>The costs to develop and create the 45 STORY Album alone is already outweighing the projected goal. The charity campaign has also presented additional costs in order to establish the platform and website so that it is transparent. It's important to me to create something to believe in that can potentially be expanded on in the future. If we don't reach the entire goal, I will be supplementing the rest of the project through any additional sales of the record. If we exceed our expectations additional funds will be used to build more outreach, create more music, build the marketing plan, and make a bigger difference.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>To celebrate the 45th anniversary of the album that launched Virgin Records, join Phil Toms and his Tubular Band as they faithfully recreate Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells in its entirety along with hit singles including Moonlight Shadow, Five Miles Out and To France and a selection of instrumental works from Hergest Ridge to Return to Ommadawn.</p>
<p>Previous performances sold out to an international audience and were supported by Richard Branson, producer Tom Newman and, via social media, by Mike Oldfield himself. Check out an <a href=""http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/15215989.Review__Tubular_Bells_hits_all_the_right_notes_at_Mercury/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""utterly brilliant"" review here. </a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.tubularbellslive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out official Tour Website www.tubularbellslive.com for all tour dates</a></p>
<p>Here's our <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TubularBellsLive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook page</a> and Phil's <a href=""http://www.philtomsmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> with <a href=""http://www.philtomsmusic.com/?p=2560"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">5 pages of colour features from the press</a>!</p>
<h3>First 5 dates booked:</h3>
<p>Mon 7th May 2018 - The Stag Theatre, Sevenoaks</p>
<p>Sun 13th May 2018 - New Theatre Royal, Portsmouth</p>
<p>Sun 27th May 2018 - The Stables, Milton Keynes</p>
<p>Sun 3rd June 2018 - Civic Theatre, Chelmsford</p>
<p>Sun 17th June 2018 - The Apex, Bury St Edmunds</p>
<h3>About the band</h3>
<p>Phil Toms is one of the UK's leading Mike Oldfield experts, performing note-for-note transcriptions with his 13-piece band. Phil has dedicated 5 years of detailed work on the music (in addition to some 30+ years of enjoyment listening and playing). </p>
<p>The glorious band features Jay Stapley (Tubular Bells II tour), Steve Smith and James Stirling on guitars, Mike McGibney (Bass for ELO Again), Rich Nolan on drums, Adam Morris on percussion, a host of other professional musicians on keys, wind, brass and even the spoons! Our singers are Hungarian hearthrob Matyas Bacsó and Matilda Bourne who will be our ""Maggie Reilly"".</p>
<p>In order to go on tour we need to book theatres (starting with a dozen around the UK), transport for the large instruments (including Tubular Bells and percussion) and a minibus for the band with substantial hotel fees up front for long-range gigs in the north of England, Scotland and Wales. Whilst each gig should pay for itself in the long run, we can't get going without the vital start up funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the theatres that require an upfront deposit this will be between £500-£1500 per theatre and the initial rehearsal venue costs £350. Just one night in a hotel for 13 musicians, our roadie and two drivers will cost c. £1500 with £1000 to hire a minibus and Luton van for a weekend. Publicity materials and merchandise will cost c. £1000.</p>
<p>Perks will include access to the tour vlog on YouTube, not-for-sale merchandise such as tour posters, tour t-shirts, plus signed programmes, VIP tickets, opportunities to watch private rehearsals and meet the band after the gig. You could also end up being the Master of Ceremonies for one of the concerts on stage! Ring out the bells!</p>
<p>The initial funds will pay for merchandise, travel costs, hotel costs and some theatres. Any profits from ticket sales will eventually be paid back to paying for more of the same later in the year as well as the band and crew fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The music of Mike Oldfield is rarely heard live in its original full version. Tubular Brass and Tubular Bells For Two are performing great adaptations of the music but we are the only current band in the UK performing the album, Mike's hit songs, famous instrumental works and even new material such as Return to Ommadawn and more! </p>
<p>Our previous concerts in 2015 and 2017 sold out to an international audience with dedicated fans flying from Brazil, Denmark, Germany, France and the Netherlands - as well as across the UK. Now we want to bring the music to you! </p>
<p>In 2015, Richard Branson recorded a special message and the MC announcements on video and we were privileged to welcome record produce Tom Newman to our stage - performing the Caveman and much more! We also featured Jay Stapley (a regular in the band) from Tubular Bells II tour era and the legendary Phil Spalding on bass. Phil played for Mike throughout the 1980s on tour, recordings and music videos - even playing the same fretless bass from the Moonlight Shadow track and video in our 2015 gig. At this original gig we had a 25-piece rock ensemble covering every single multitrack layer note for note. Our MC was the great Roger Eno.</p>
<p>In 2017, we raised over £8500 for charity at the Mercury Theatre, again with a sold out audience and this proved that a 12-strong band can work well and the fans and press love it!</p>
<p><strong>Here are some quotes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tom Newman</strong> (Tubular Bells Producer) “This has been a wonderful event and bless you, Phil Toms, because without him, nothing would have happened. Phil Toms! Yeah!… Well done Phil Toms! Well done!”</p>
<p><strong>From the Mercury Theatre team:</strong> “Fantastic! Thanks to Phil and the team and of course to our lovely audience for their support! #MercuryRising” Fundraising over £8500 for charity.</p>
<p><strong>Quotes from the audience: </strong></p>
<p>“Saw TB Live on Sat, absolutely brilliant! Never thought I would hear MO’s music live. Return to O was superb! You must tour!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, it was a fabulous performance!”</p>
<p>“You’re an inspiration mate!”</p>
<p>“The excerpt of Return to Ommadawn was exceptionally well done”</p>
<p>“What a great weekend in Colchester. So much Mike Oldfield. So many great friends. Hope we can do it all again soon.”</p>
<p>“What a fab show by the most excellent Phil Toms and band. Great set list too!”</p>
<p>“Superb evening so much enthusiasm and hard work paid off”</p>
<p>“What an incredible experience your concert was – it was amazing. My brothers were big Oldfield fans but I wasn’t so hadn’t a clue as to what I was letting myself in for! I’m hooked now. Congratulations”</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Once we have performed a few concerts, the income from ticket sales should pay for the band, crew and help cover future hire costs but the initial funding will be vital to this campaign. We are also looking for sponsorship from other companies to contribute to the fundraising. </p>
</div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Bicurious, a heavy instrumental rock duo hailing from Dublin, Ireland. We have been playing together as a band since September 2016. We've released 2 singles and played many sweaty rock shows all over Ireland, including Electric Picnic Festival. We strongly believe in the power of originality, and we want to make music that no-one has ever heard before!</p>
<p>We have gotten to a stage where we need to make a big statement to the world, and we believe a high quality EP is going to achieve that.  We are going over to the UK to record this EP, with Producer/Engineer Tom Peters of Alpha Male Tea Party (a band we love and admire!). We know that he is just the right person to produce a record that will take us to the next level and help us progress as a band, as well as attracting the right attention to us. We have been growing very fast since we started this band a year ago, gotten a good buzz going around Dublin and Ireland, and we want to keep the momentum going as we believe in this band and our music so much. </p>
<p>Your contribution will mean the absolute world to us. We need as much help as we can on this project, as every step of the release needs to be done to a very high standard if we want it to be successful. Recording, artwork, duplication and promotion are all very expensive things, and we don't want to take a cheap and lazy approach to it. Our goal is to make this the best work of art we have aver taken part in, and we know you can help us achieve that. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We are asking for 1000 euros to go towards the recording of our EP. This is not the entirety of the cost, but we want to pay for some of the project ourselves with the money the band has made over the last year. Unfortunately, we have not made enough, hence why we need your help. Recording costs 1700 euros altogether, and if we add artwork, duplication and promotion to that we come up to around 2500 euros. So we are not resting on our laurels, because even if you guys help us reach the 1000 euro target, we will still be working on our side to raise the rest of the money. It's a big, scary and expensive project but we believe in it.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We know that a lot of our friends/fans are musicians themselves. We can guarantee that we will return the favour if your band ever needs a hand raising money or doing anything else. There is a great sense of community among musicians in the Irish music scene, and we want to keep that brotherly attitude going, helping each other out.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We have set rewards for each donation over 5 euro: </li></ul>
<p>- 5 euro gets you a copy of the EP</p>
<p>- 10 euro gets you a copy of the EP and free entry to the EP launch gig in Dublin</p>
<p>- 20 euro gets you all of the above  and a thank you goodie-bag </p>
<p>- 50 euro gets you all of the above and 5 guestlists to our upcoming shows</p>
<p>- 100 euro gets you all of the above and FREE entry to our headline shows FOREVER</p>
<p>- 200 euro gets you all of the above and we'll play a gig in your house</p>
<ul><li>If we don't reach our goal, we will still keep whatever we make but we will struggle to pay for this project, which is why we really need your help to reach the target. 100 people donating 10 euro gets us there!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>By donating, you'll be contributing to the Irish independent music scene, and to the instrumental rock scene worldwide. If you love music, or even just listen to music sometimes, you can relate to the importance of good music in your life. We are trying to change music, to produce original content to keep things going forward, instead of reproducing music that has already been done before! There is nothing better, in our opinion, than refreshing and innovative music. </li>
<li>Donating will build a real connection between us, and we will owe each and every single donor a solid. Every single person will be remembered and thanked, because we have a huge respect for anyone we can call a fan. Everyday, new people get to hear our music and we are incredibly grateful and humbled whenever anyone says they're a fan of our music... And fans make bands real. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We could run the risk of not reaching our target, and therefore having to struggle to pay for either the recording, duplicating or promotion of the EP. </p>
<ul><li>We know that we have enough fans, friends and family that will hopefully be willing to donate and help us. We strongly believe that it will be achieved.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, or want to contribute more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please tell people and share our story on social media as much as you can. It's just as important as donating.</li>
<li>We will be holding a Fundraiser Concert on the 11th of November in Sin E in Dublin. </li>
</ul>
<p>We know that it's easy to just think that someone else will donate, that you don't have to worry about it... But we need every single person's help on this. No donation is too small, and like Tesco would say: Every little helps. </p>
</div><p>Thank you so much. </p></div>","Short Summary

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>My name is Kylie Jenkins and I perform under the title, “Wonderwench.” I was born and raised in the Coachella Valley, California, surrounded by music, and always found solace in self-expression. Music means the world to me and so do listeners, fellow musicians, collaborators, and contributors. I am deeply rooted in my passion for writing, singing, playing piano, guitar, and whatever the hell I can get my hands on. In the words of Conor Oberst, “I like to feel the burn of the audience's eyes when I'm whispering all my darkest secrets into the microphone.” 

This is my debut EP and I need all the help I can get to make it happen. I need contributions so I can do what I love and you can love what I do. I want to share my music with passionate like-minded people like you! I need $500 so I can make physical copies of the EP, and some rad merch for you good people.

Think of your favorite artist and all the shite they got you through in high school. Think of the times you were sobbing in your bed to Evanescence and My Chemical Romance, that later matured into Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, Elliott Smith, Brand New, or Bob Dylan. All those artists had to start somewhere, and so do I. I’ve gotten some exciting and encouraging reviews from my teaser track “Earthbound”, my favorite of which was “I’m sitting in a cafe listening to you sing and crying in public because you and your music are beautiful.”

If I don’t reach my goal, the money will go to as many copies of the EP the resulting budget allows, and continue to raise funds in my community.

This is my first major project and I’m bound to make some mistakes, but I’m excited about the learning process they will afford me on the journey to becoming the artist I aspire to be.  Learning to overcome stage fright has empowered me already, and I know that with your help my dream of alternately comforting and challenging the world with my words and music can become a reality. Please share this campaign and my teaser track with your friends/family/cats.<br/></p></div>","My name is Kylie Jenkins and I perform under the title, “Wonderwench.” I was born and raised in the Coachella Valley, California, surrounded by music, and always found solace in self-expression. Music means the world to me and so do listeners, fellow musicians, collaborators, and contributors. I am deeply rooted in my passion for writing, singing, playing piano, guitar, and whatever the hell I can get my hands on. In the words of Conor Oberst, “I like to feel the burn of the audience's eyes when I'm whispering all my darkest secrets into the microphone.” 

This is my debut EP and I need all the help I can get to make it happen. I need contributions so I can do what I love and you can love what I do. I want to share my music with passionate like-minded people like you! I need $500 so I can make physical copies of the EP, and some rad merch for you good people.

Think of your favorite artist and all the shite they got you through in high school. Think of the times you were sobbing in your bed to Evanescence and My Chemical Romance, that later matured into Death Cab for Cutie, Bright Eyes, Elliott Smith, Brand New, or Bob Dylan. All those artists had to start somewhere, and so do I. I’ve gotten some exciting and encouraging reviews from my teaser track “Earthbound”, my favorite of which was “I’m sitting in a cafe listening to you sing and crying in public because you and your music are beautiful.”

If I don’t reach my goal, the money will go to as many copies of the EP the resulting budget allows, and continue to raise funds in my community.

This is my first major project and I’m bound to make some mistakes, but I’m excited about the learning process they will afford me on the journey to becoming the artist I aspire to be.  Learning to overcome stage fright has empowered me already, and I know that with your help my dream of alternately comforting and challenging the world with my words and music can become a reality. Please share this campaign and my teaser track with your friends/family/cats.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I've been making music independently for about ten years now and in that time I've managed to record three full length albums on a shoestring budget... but the time has come for me to take a shot at something more, it's time for me to make a world class record that'll be heard around the world. I'm going in a bit of a new direction on this record (It's much more dynamic, cinematic, and engaging, with programmed beats, grand piano, strings, synth pop textures, and plenty of vocals). These new songs are the best songs I've ever written and producer Elisa Pangsaeng is blowing my mind on the production side of things, I can't wait to share em with you, but I'm definitely gonna need your help to bring them to life!



What I Need & What You Get:

Risks and Challenges
$35,000 won't be an easy goal to attain but I believe in magic, and music, and the generosity of others, so I'm all in.

Siamo Lorenzo e Nadia, sposati con tre figli.Abbiamo
fondato una casa di produzione cinematografica, brunchCinema.
Ormai sono alcuni
anni che realizziamo prodotti cinematografici: cortometraggi, videoclip, spot

Proprio quest’ultima tipologia di prodotto

Hello! We are Lorenzo and Nadia: we are married and  have three

During the past years we have been producing short films, music videos, 
commercials, events and documentaries; it's thanks to this just 
mentioned kind of production that we came up to what we call ""360MUSIC"".



Cos'è ""360 MUSIC""?


E’ una rubrica musicale, caricata sul nostro canale youtube, che
cerca, tramite piccoli documentari, di far conoscere i talenti musicali del
nostro territorio.
Questo progetto ci sta appassionando moltissimo e riscuote un grande interesse sia tra chi produce musica sia da chi
ne usufruisce. Il nostro territorio, come del resto tutto il mondo, è
ricchissimo di talenti musicali.
Ma perché 360? 360 perché la nostra rubrica tratta la musica a
360 gradi ovvero vuole parlare di tutti coloro che fanno musica, senza
barriere, chi fa spettacolo tramite musical, solisti o band, di
qualsiasi genere musicale.
What's ""360MUSIC""? It's our online music programme on our youtube 
channel. We make short documentaries, aiming to let people get to know

Because in the end, I bring all of that home with me. That success will feed back into my community through acts of charity, as I have already performed in several charity events and am interested in organizing some of my own. </p><p>Thank you again for your continued support!!</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Hello! My name is Sarah
Cooperider and I am a singer/songwriter based out of Columbus, Ohio. I have
been playing regularly at my monthly show 'Chicks with Picks' and at a
multitude of shows around town for over a year, and have found it to be my
passion. After the success of my showcase at Pride as well as the other
festivals, contests and shows I played this summer (Pride, Ohio Lesbian
Festival, Femmefest, O'Toole's Live Music Competition, etc) I have decided to
stop denying my calling and devote the next year of my life to becoming a full
time musician! To help this dream become a reality I have decided to release my
very first album! </p>
<p>These
campaigns are designed to help ""kickstart"" these dreams to life (or
make them indie-go-go?), so here is what I present to you:</p>
<p>By contributing to
this campaign, you are helping me fund a professionally produced studio album.
Every dollar you donate will be spent in the pursuit of making the best quality
album for everyone to hear. The majority of the funds will go toward the actual
studio recording/mastering, etc and the rest will be going toward getting the
content to you via CD and download! I am providing a variety of
""perks"" including preordering my CD! </p>
<p>I have set a date to
begin recording in the next two weeks so that I can finish the album and get it
to you as soon as possible! I can assure you it will be out in plenty of time
for the Holidays! (It makes a great gift! ::wink::) I also plan on giving you
regular updates as things move along! </p>
<p>I am poised for even
greater success in the coming year - bigger shows and festivals, requests for
booking from local venues, travel opportunities, etc - and I would love for all
of you to be a part of making this dream come true! </p>

About the Goal
This campaign is to get the album ""Shadow Songs""  out into the physical world where people can enjoy the music on  CD and LP.
  
I am seeking to raise $2,500 (CAD) to cover the anticipated expenses related to manufacturing and distributing a limited run of CDs and LPs as well as the studio time required to make the album. Since the album is self-released there is no financial support from a label, so I am reaching out to you for your help!

Local Love This album was written, recorded, produced, mixed and mastered all in St. Catharines, ON and features the talents of local musicians. The release show will be the official launch of the album but also a celebration of the St. Catharines community and the love that you have shown this music throughout the last five years.

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are Faintheart and we are an indie rock band from the Sunflower State of Kansas and we are asking for YOUR help to record our next album! This album, ‘The Overview Effect’ is an album about being connected and our shared humanity. In a time of disconnectedness, and confusion we took those feelings and rather than harboring cynicism we decided to create something to help us better understand ourselves, and better understand the world around us. This album is important to us, and we would not be able to do it without your help. By helping us, you are contributing to art that aims to heal and restore.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are asking for your help to raise $6,000 for our next EP. Here’s the thing, we have already written the record and it is ready to go, so we aren’t asking for your help to fund something that doesn’t exist. In turn, we want to give you this new album early by helping to fund this project. We want to get to know you, and our campaign updates are going to include our Listening Club and we are going to share albums that mean a lot to us and we want to know what means a lot to you! We are partnering with a coffee roaster to bring you custom Faintheart Coffee (you should know we live on coffee) and we are even recording a ‘Hushed’ EP with acoustic/reimagining of some of our current songs and maybe a few new ones! So yes, you’re going to get even more music by helping us.</p>
<h2>Okay. So What?</h2>
<p>We believe in these songs. It’s as simple as that. We have managed to do the past release of songs by ourselves, but we think that these songs are so important that we want to spend as much time on them to bring you the best music that we possibly can. What does that look like? It looks like us spending more time with the team at Shadow Scape Records to dive into each song and squeeze out the marrow of art. Again, we have already finished writing this record, so think of this like a preorder, because we are not asking you to fund something that does not exist. We believe that art is powerful, and that art can heal, and we are asking for your help to create something that we think matters.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Recording an album is expensive. We are asking for $6,000 to help cover the bare minimum that we have done the math for to cover the creation of this record. Your generosity, will obviously be going to help us buy iPads, lots of candy, a sports car and pay our rent. Just kidding. Your money will actually be going to the costs of:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Studio Time</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Engineer Time</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Producer Time</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mixing Time</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mastering Time</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">CD Production Costs</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are asking for your help to record The Overview Effect and help bring these songs to life!</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We get it 100%. You might not be able to help out financially, but just telling your friends and families and all of your weird uncles about this album, and about this Crowdfund Campaign will help tremendously. Honestly, anytime you tell someone about our band it helps, and we are not sure if we have ever found a proper way to thank everyone, but we think that continuing to create music is a great start to that. Follow us on social media, and Indiegogo has great share tools built in. We would love your support in whatever way that looks like to you.</p>

<p>One of our biggest challenges in bringing our music to you has been managing our schedules as busy musicians. As a result, we have put enormous time and effort into working on the music we will be sharing with you. Even when it involves juggling emails, Skype meetings and rehearsals in different parts of the country, our energy has been focused on improving our craft and bringing the best we have to give. We have made all the arrangements for the recording, which will take place at the Gould Recital Hall at the Curtis Institute of Music. We also have a wonderfully talented production and engineering team lined up. We have devoted countless hours of rehearsal and planning towards this project and we are ready to see our dream come to fruition.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of all, of course, is having the means to pay for it. This is where you come in. We are ready, but we do need your help to push us through to the next step.

<h3>Who are we?</h3> <p></p>
<p><a href=""http://acttoostudio.com/?page_id=1374"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Act Too Studio Opera Workshop</a> is an ongoing, student-driven educational arts project with performances throughout the year, including a fully-staged opera each summer.</p>
<p>Our growing workshop includes students between the ages of 13-19 at varying levels of vocal development, musical skill, and experience. Works are chosen with those factors in mind, and though this work is intended to be performed for the community, the focus of the workshop itself is very process-heavy. In order to bring their work to performance level, students are guided through deep musical and theatrical analysis of everything they do, along with study of the work’s cultural and historical context.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<div>
<p>Though we went into this project with the goal of improving our students’ musical skills, the real understanding that came out of it for all of us is that opera is for everyone. As our students discovered themselves and their own truths in the music and in their characters, their driving motivation became to share this discovery with everyone they know. And then they did, with remarkable success. </p>
<p>Tickets for last summer’s full opera production (Gian Carlo Menotti’s <i><a href=""http://acttoostudio.com/?page_id=1674"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Medium</a></i>) were mostly gone well before opening night, and we found ourselves scrambling to cram in extra seats as other teens begged to be able to get in—some for a repeat performance. Just as our students surprised us with their initial interest in this project, they’ve also been the ones to show us that our conventional ideas about what most people will like or accept are just plain wrong.</p>
</div>
<div><h3>What are we doing?</h3></div> <p></p>
<p>Act Too Studio Opera Workshop presents the works of 17th-century composer Claudio Monteverdi in <i><a href=""http://acttoostudio.com/?page_id=2625"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Il sogno d'Arianna</a><a href=""http://acttoostudio.com/?page_id=2625"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, a full-length, original narrative woven from excerpts from his operas, madrigals, and other works.</p>
<p>Drawing on the framework of Monteverdi’s “Lamento d’Arianna,” the sole surviving fragment of his opera <i>L’Arianna</i>, <i>Il sogno d’Arianna</i> begins with the tale of Ariadne, princess of Crete, and her abandonment by Athenian hero Theseus on the island of Naxos. Joined by an assembly of women hailing from Monteverdi’s many sources, including Greek myth and Torquato Tasso’s epic 16th-century poem <i>La Gerusalemme liberata</i> (<i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>), Ariadne seeks comfort and meaning in their shared stories, told through both music dance.</p>
<p>In addition to <i>L’Arianna</i>, the piece includes excerpts from Monteverdi’s <i>L’Orfeo</i>, as well as pieces from his 8th book of madrigals and selected <i>Scherzi Musicali</i> (“Lamento della ninfa,” “Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda,” “Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti,” “Chiome d’oro“and many more). For this project, the Workshop has created its own new editions of these works, including new English translations and arrangements adapted specifically for its teen singers.</p>
<p>This project does not stop at our production, however, We will also publish our new English libretto and newly-edited score for licensed use by other educational institutions, to help share our love for this work for years to come. With its accessible libretto, scored for flexible voice types, it is an ideal vehicle for production by young classical singers. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Why do we need your help?</h3> <p>In an era when the arts have become increasingly a luxury item, we at Act Too Studio Opera Workshop are dedicated to making our programming accessible to all our teens and to the community as a whole. To that end, we ask for your help.<br/></p>
<p>This is by far the most ambitious project our workshop has undertaken–twice the length of our previous endeavors, with more than twice the number of cast members. More significantly, however, it is the depth and complexity of Monteverdi's music that calls for special attention. To help our teens get the most out of this experience, we've sought the expertise of cellist and composer James David Jacobs, whose deep knowledge of Monteverdi's work has allowed us to create our own new editions of this music for the workshop, which he is currently guiding them through in rehearsal, with a focus on both emotional and intellectual understanding of the music and text, as well as historical performance practice.  </p>
<p>This piece will be truly special, incorporating theater, ballet, and stage combat to bring Monteverdi's beautiful work to life,  in English (some for the very first time), for a new audience.  To help give this project the visibility it deserves, we've chosen to perform in the Pioneer Valley’s own beautiful, historic opera house, The Academy of Music. <br/></p>
<p>We've been fundraising all year for this project, and only have a short ways left to go! Your donations help us pay for this production's artistic needs, specifically the early music expertise, musical direction, and both ballet and fight choreography, as well as musicians to play for rehearsals and performances, our wonderful rehearsal space at Lighthouse Holyoke, set pieces, costumes, and, of course, our time at the Academy with its highly-trained technical staff. </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How else can you help?</h3> <p>We believe that this project is something extraordinary, and we're proud to be creating it, both for our students, and for the community that has nurtured them and opened their hearts (and ears!) to the beauty of opera. If you're unable to contribute, you can still help spread the word!  If you think our teen opera program is something special, make some noise about it! Use Indiegogo's share tools to tell your friends and family about what we're doing, and encourage them to support us!   In return, we will make you the most beautiful piece we can. We will make you proud. </p>

Scheduled to premiere in January of 2018 at the Dell E. Webb Center in Wickenburg, Arizona, the SHUFFLE team hopes to perform ""1933"", a fascinating, all-engrossing, multi-media, concert experience, throughout the United States. In addition to the usual, spectacular playing and singing that SHUFFLE Concert fans have grown accustomed to, ""1933"" will feature archival and original video footage, as well as historic images of the art and architecture of the day, all illuminated by an original lighting design.<br/><br/>""1933"" allows SHUFFLE Concert to step outside the box by creating a unique experience in which music, art, and history intersect. We need your help to bring this innovative concept to the concert stage! This is an opportunity for you to have a front row seat during the creation of an original concert production that celebrates the life and music of some of the greatest musicians, composers, and writers of the 20th Century.</p><p><strong>What &amp; What?</strong></p><p>Your generous donation will help us in several important ways:</p><ul>
<li>Commission unique arrangements by composers Jonathan Keren and Dan Kaufman</li>
<li>Commission of an original David Bruce composition to be based on Lorca's ""Blood Wedding"" (written in 1933) </li>
<li>Create original video interludes using archival footage</li>
<li>Hire a director and lighting designer</li>
<li>Video documentation of ""1933""</li>
<li>Public relations</li>
<li>Purchase performing rights for music that is not in public domain</li>
<li>And ensure that we have enough gas to get to Wickenburg! </li>

From the reign of George V to the dictatorship of Stalin, from Gandhi's hunger strike to the Ukranian genocide, and from FDR's New Deal to the end of Prohibition in the United States, 1933 marked the beginning of an era rife with political turmoil and human suffering. SHUFFLE Concert's ""1933"" illuminates the historical, sociological and political impact of this period by exploring the music and art of this remarkable era in human history. During this thought-provoking and moving concert experience, you will be enlightened and inspired by the indomitable strength and spirit of the writers, composers, musicians, and artists who absorbed the turbulence of the era, resonated it in their souls, and reflected it in their art.</p><p>We look forward to partnering with you on this exciting, new venture.

Scheduled to premiere in January of 2018 at the Dell E. Webb Center in Wickenburg, Arizona, the SHUFFLE team hopes to perform ""1933"", a fascinating, all-engrossing, multi-media, concert experience, throughout the United States. In addition to the usual, spectacular playing and singing that SHUFFLE Concert fans have grown accustomed to, ""1933"" will feature archival and original video footage, as well as historic images of the art and architecture of the day, all illuminated by an original lighting design.""1933"" allows SHUFFLE Concert to step outside the box by creating a unique experience in which music, art, and history intersect.

Check out the perks menu to see what you get in return for your donation (not to mention our undying gratitude)!         Why is this project important?1933, a pivotal year in world history, saw the advent of political figures, sociological movements, and historic events that influenced the remainder of the 20th Century as well as the world we live in today. From the reign of George V to the dictatorship of Stalin, from Gandhi's hunger strike to the Ukranian genocide, and from FDR's New Deal to the end of Prohibition in the United States, 1933 marked the beginning of an era rife with political turmoil and human suffering. SHUFFLE Concert's ""1933"" illuminates the historical, sociological and political impact of this period by exploring the music and art of this remarkable era in human history. During this thought-provoking and moving concert experience, you will be enlightened and inspired by the indomitable strength and spirit of the writers, composers, musicians, and artists who absorbed the turbulence of the era, resonated it in their souls, and reflected it in their art.We look forward to partnering with you on this exciting, new venture.

<h3>OUR PROJECT</h3>
<p>This music video will be a chance to further the message of “Truth” through a visual experience that will put the song in perspective and context. It’s a chance to expose more people to the music and create a connection between the viewers, listeners, and the message of the song. The choice between accepting life as it truly is or blocking out the dark parts as best you can is something we all have to make and this video will help to show people that you’re not alone and that whatever you decide, there are people living in your world, whichever one you choose. </p>
<p>Julia is incredibly excited to collaborate with Jake on the visual expression “Truth.” She connected strongly to the themes expressed in Jakes song - the fact that growing up means growing to see people as whole and imperfect and realizing that theres a beauty in that. Its a blessing to find good music and Julia is incredibly excited to create something with Jake to help bring exposure to his talents. </p>
<h3>OUR TEAM </h3>
<p>Jake Tavill (Artist): </p>

<p>If the soulful, empathetic lyrics and melodies of Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and Bill Withers had an illegitimate child with the complex, moving instrumentation of Parliament Funkadelic, it would result in the music of Jake Tavill. He voices his messages through honest, introspective lyrics working in tandem with an accompaniment that illustrates the deep emotions of the stories he tells.</p>
<p>     At 21, he has studied music at Berklee College of Music, the Village East Conservatory, and is currently studying at NYU Tisch’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.

<h3>THE NECESSITIES</h3>
<p>While our goal is to create a low-budget film, the more money we are able to raise, the more we will be able to fully realize the vision for this song. Your money goes towards covering the production costs of this music video. We want to use the best equipment possible and, with your help, we can get there! To add to the excitement of funding our project (apart from the excitement of supporting our awesome group), we have included multiple ""perks"". Jake and his band are incredibly talented and we are looking forward to seeing this project take off!</p>

</div></div>","OUR PROJECT
This music video will be a chance to further the message of “Truth” through a visual experience that will put the song in perspective and context. It’s a chance to expose more people to the music and create a connection between the viewers, listeners, and the message of the song. The choice between accepting life as it truly is or blocking out the dark parts as best you can is something we all have to make and this video will help to show people that you’re not alone and that whatever you decide, there are people living in your world, whichever one you choose. 
Julia is incredibly excited to collaborate with Jake on the visual expression “Truth.” She connected strongly to the themes expressed in Jakes song - the fact that growing up means growing to see people as whole and imperfect and realizing that theres a beauty in that. Its a blessing to find good music and Julia is incredibly excited to create something with Jake to help bring exposure to his talents. 
OUR TEAM 
Jake Tavill (Artist): 

If the soulful, empathetic lyrics and melodies of Marvin Gaye, Isaac Hayes, and Bill Withers had an illegitimate child with the complex, moving instrumentation of Parliament Funkadelic, it would result in the music of Jake Tavill. He voices his messages through honest, introspective lyrics working in tandem with an accompaniment that illustrates the deep emotions of the stories he tells.
     At 21, he has studied music at Berklee College of Music, the Village East Conservatory, and is currently studying at NYU Tisch’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. Jake plays frequently with his backing band, The Indigo Child Blues Band, in NYC and NJ, along with popular and classic venues all across the U.S. Jake loves writing and performing his music, but nothing makes him happier than having a personal connection with his audience.

<h3>Quick Summary</h3>
<p>Kia ora koutou!</p>
<p>Welcome to our crowdfunding campaign, aimed at helping us finance the production and distribution of our debut album!</p>
<p>In exchange for the boundless kindness and generosity you may show by participating in this campaign, we have prepared a whole bunch of awesome prizes at a range of prizes to match your budget.</p>
<p>Just in case you have any questions about how this all works, or why you should even care, we’ve prepared an FAQ below. Please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us if you have any further questions though!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who the hell is Dillastrate?</h3>
<p>We are a two-piece hip-hop and soul band from Christchurch, New Zealand with a deep passion for music. We also work our arses off for it, to the point whereby over our two short years of existence, we have managed to complete nine tours of New Zealand, playing staple music festival stages including Northern Bass, Rhythm &amp; Vines and Electric Avenue. Our music is a hearty mix of soul, hip-hop and electronica, with heavy hat tips to soul legends Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. Our prior releases include Black Diamond EP (November 2019) and follow-up single ""I Don't Care"" (recorded at Neil Finn's Roundhead Studios in Auckland), which are available on all good music platforms now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why should I care?</h3>
<p>Much to the disappointment of all recording artists the world over, gone are the heady days of musicians being discovered by record label representatives and subsequently being given all the resources required to produce their recordings. In the music industry nowadays, the musicians themselves are often self-funded, scrimping and saving and emptying out the piggy bank to pay for the opportunity to record their music and release it out into the world. With the help of some kind, generous and presumably attractive benefactors, musicians have the opportunity to produce some of the music that we all love without the fear of going either bankrupt or having a mental breakdown trying to put it all together.</p>
<p>Until now, we have been very privileged to be able to finance our recordings ourselves from playing shows around New Zealand. Unfortunately, we have reached the limit of what we can achieve financially in producing our debut album and are in need of a little help – this is where you guys come in!</p>
<p>If you love the music that we make, love music in general, to support arts in the community, or are just a bloody lovely person, donating to this campaign provides an opportunity to do so. We couldn’t continue to do what we do without the loving support of our families, friends and communities – every little bit helps and is deeply appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do I get out of it?</h3>
<p>Well – beyond the invaluable gift of being able to help people achieve their dreams – we have prepared a range of awesome rewards to compensate your generosity, at a range of prices for every budget. These include the opportunity to force us to cover a song of your choice on our YouTube channel, to booking us to perform live at your private event, to receiving a copy of our album on a format of your choice before its official release date! Check out the rewards listed on this page for more details.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When do I get my stuff?</h3>
<p>After the end of the campaign on March 31<sup>st</sup>, we will begin the process of administrating all of your donations and get to work on distributing your stuff! This all relies on our ability to produce the physical copies of the album which, without an official release date as of yet, is difficult to say at present. However, rest assured that as soon as we are happy with the album and are in a position to duplicate it, we will rush your well-deserved copy right to you. If you have any issues around the timeliness of your delivery or any other questions/queries about this process, please get in touch via one of our platforms listed on this page.</p>

<p><i>Your $65+ contribution guarantees you a ticket to the annually sold-out festival. As our only annual fundraiser, your support via Indiegogo plays a crucial role in our success. <strong>globalFEST takes a full year of planning, and donations and ticket sales cover only a fraction of ever-rising costs.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>17 Years of Advancing Artists</h3>
<p>globalFEST believes that music can be a driving force toward a society that values cultural diversity as a source of unity rather than division and our supporters make this work possible! globalFEST is one of today’s most pioneering music festivals and the most important platform for global artists in North America. Hundreds of bands have made their marks on the US touring scene because of globalFEST. Through gF’s programs like the gF Touring Fund and gF On The Road, bands have reached tens of thousands of new audiences, creating and helping fulfill an ever growing demand for world music in all venue types.</p> <h3>gF's Venue</h3>
<p>We return to The Copacabana, the iconic Latin music hub with decades of culture-shaping history to its credit. The Copacabana has inspired countless musicians over the years (not to mention one particular song which is probably earworming you right now), and proved a source of inspiration for globalFEST in programming this year’s edition. globalFEST sells out in advance each year and we expect this year to be no different - this Indiegogo campaign is the best way to secure your ticket.</p>

Your ticket is guaranteed through your contribution of $65 or more. Thank you for your support!
Artists who have performed at globalFEST have gone on to perform at some of the most important performing arts centers, festivals and nightclubs in the world. As they tour, they bring their own cultural perspectives to communities across the US, Canada, and elsewhere at a time where creating opportunities for cultural exchange and diverse perspectives is more important than ever.

Your $65+ contribution guarantees you a ticket to the annually sold-out festival. As our only annual fundraiser, your support via Indiegogo plays a crucial role in our success. globalFEST takes a full year of planning, and donations and ticket sales cover only a fraction of ever-rising costs.
 
17 Years of Advancing Artists
globalFEST believes that music can be a driving force toward a society that values cultural diversity as a source of unity rather than division and our supporters make this work possible! globalFEST is one of today’s most pioneering music festivals and the most important platform for global artists in North America. Hundreds of bands have made their marks on the US touring scene because of globalFEST. Through gF’s programs like the gF Touring Fund and gF On The Road, bands have reached tens of thousands of new audiences, creating and helping fulfill an ever growing demand for world music in all venue types. gF's Venue
We return to The Copacabana, the iconic Latin music hub with decades of culture-shaping history to its credit. The Copacabana has inspired countless musicians over the years (not to mention one particular song which is probably earworming you right now), and proved a source of inspiration for globalFEST in programming this year’s edition. globalFEST sells out in advance each year and we expect this year to be no different - this Indiegogo campaign is the best way to secure your ticket.

 
Your Support
Your contribution directly supports cultural understanding through music by helping to launch global artists into the touring market via globalFEST, an artist-centric organization dedicated to projects that help international artists develop sustainable careers. Find out about all the work we do here at www.globalfest.org. gF started as an antidote to xenophobic sentiments in the U.S. and around the world in 2002; the first globalFEST took place in 2003. Through the support of our colleagues, forward-thinking funders, and engaged fans, we have grown to become an internationally recognized, agile, and responsive organization. gF invests its limited resources and leverages partnerships strategically in tireless pursuit of our mission to serve artists, the performing arts field, and the general public. Thank you for supporting our work--none of this is possible without you.

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong> </p>
<p>The Playground Ensemble is a group of professional musicians and composers. We are  dedicated to presenting chamber music as a <i>living</i> art form. We are in our 11th year, proud to be Colorado’s only ensemble with the sole focus on modern music.</p>
<p><strong>Why this project?</strong></p>
<p>New chamber music doesn’t easily find its way to the listening public, but if you agree with us that new music deserves to be heard, you’ll appreciate what this project means to us: Co-commissioning a new work from a Pulitzer prize-winning composer and performing it, together with Roomful of Teeth, on a prestigious concert stage.</p>
<p><strong>What is it about?</strong></p>
<p>Composer Caroline Shaw wrote a new piece, <i>This Might Also Be a Form of Dreaming</i>; The Playground co-commissioned it and will perform it in concert in January of 2017. We look for funding to help with the costs associated with this project.</p>
<p>The work is based on text taken from poet Claudia Rankine's <i>Don't Let Me Be Lonely. </i>The composer writes:</p>
<p>""The work begins with the final words and the beautifully dangling preposition,of, which is the book’s final cadence.</p>
<p>Each of the seven movements takes up a slightly different mode of musical writing, or a slightly different task vis-à-vis the excerpts of Rankine’s text. I tried to preserve the intimacy and clarity of succinct phrases such as “I am here” and “ Here you are” while amplifying the complexity of the book’s project as a whole (alluded to in her observation,“ The world moves through words”).</p>
<p>Ultimately, the heart of the piece is a reflection of one of the most beautiful passages: “Sometimes you read something and a thought that was floating around in your veins organizes itself into the sentence that reflects it. This might also be a form of dreaming.”</p>
<p><strong>Why should you support us?</strong></p>
<p>New chamber music is not a profitable business, but <i>new music is our mission</i>. We have a long track record of supporting new music and bringing it to life, in schools, in concerts, and in collaboration with other artists. The Playground is in a unique and important position when it comes to programming, educational outreach, and the mutually beneficial relationship with area composers.</p>
<p>We now hold approximately 100 events each season, including performances, community music-making events, music creation programs for students in K-12 schools and regional colleges, and special events for senior citizens. </p>
<p><strong>What’s special about this project?</strong></p>
<p>The commission and concert performance of <i>This Might Also Be a Form of Dreaming</i> goes beyond the regional scope and puts us on the national map in terms of recognition. If we recoup the associated expenses, we will look to more collaborations with composers and artists from beyond our immediate area. Your contribution will allow us to do just that.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help?</strong></p>
<p>Contribute right here on indiegogo. By contributing to this campaign you invest in an art form that flies below the radar of the commercial music industry. Composers need performers to bring their new music to life, and this project is a big step in this ongoing mission of ours.</p>

<p>This whole EP will be fundamentally sharing the things we ""Pure O"" OCD sufferers least want to expose to peers, in hopes of putting light on the darkness of obsessive compulsive embarrassment that causes shame. </p>
<p>Shame is a silent disease, and ""Pure O"" OCD fosters so much shame in its sufferers. We want to create awareness for the advancement of the psychological world in Pure O treatment, and slowly exterminate shame in the minds of 1 in every 40 people. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
We're making our second album, hoping that it will raise awareness for ""Pure O"" OCD and anxiety. 1 in 40 people suffer from OCD - most sufferers grow up thinking they are crazy pre diagnosis, not knowing what is ""wrong"" with them. 
This whole EP will be fundamentally sharing the things we ""Pure O"" OCD sufferers least want to expose to peers, in hopes of putting light on the darkness of obsessive compulsive embarrassment that causes shame. 
Shame is a silent disease, and ""Pure O"" OCD fosters so much shame in its sufferers. We want to create awareness for the advancement of the psychological world in Pure O treatment, and slowly exterminate shame in the minds of 1 in every 40 people. 
   What We Need 
2k to be able to pay the producer so we can record the album
2k to pay for two months of service from a publicist we are in contact that will do a ""PR Blast"" that releases and promotes the material through psychology and music blogs, magazines, radio. 
1k to pay for the studio ""mastering"" that will be done by a sound engineer we know in New Mexico 
2k to make a music video for our latest single 'Ivory Black', which has been broadcast nationally on KCRW radio - this will cover the director, camera, operator, editing, shooting/set fees
2k to make a music video for our upcoming single, exposing phobias in obsessive compulsive disorder - this will cover the director, operator, editing, shooting/set fees
500 to buy a microphone (alex has been singing into a microphone that he bought when he was 16 for 99 bucks - sadly its dying!)
500 to buy a Roland SPDSX percussion kit

<p>For those who know me, you might be thinking, “awesome
Anthony came out with a new project finally,” and for those who don’t, you
might be thinking, “this sounds like it’s gonna be another one of those cliché
inspirational projects that won’t catch any wind.” </p>
<p>Whether you click away out of boredom or keep watching due
to curiosity, I’m not really swayed by either decision. I guess what I’m trying
to say is, “I don’t care if you care about me or not, this is something I feel
like I need to be doing.”</p>
<p>When I was little I was always told that my life would be a
set course of going to school, graduating college, getting married with an
impressive degree, and then retiring when I got old. I was never told that I
could be famous rock star, or be a famous actor or anything because those things
were just too impossible. Was college and working a career my only choice? Is
that all my life would be? Is that all anybody’s life would be? If that was
true then that meant that everybody was the same. If that was true then, I
wasn’t really important at all. And that after I worked really hard and lived
my whole life that I would still be insignificant. </p>
<p>The only thing I’ve ever found significance in was well, my
music. I’ve played music since I was five years old, and began to play the
guitar when I started junior high. I wrote a lot of songs but I was just always
too poor to get them recorded. So, I said “what the hell” and created this
project. I have a lot of good things to say and I feel like I have a lot of
talent too, and if you want to help some kid take a crazy gamble in chasing his
dream, well I couldn’t thank you enough. If I’m going to die one day regardless
of what I do, then I may as well be dying chasing after what I love.  </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","For those who know me, you might be thinking, “awesome

There are 3 members to our band: Jason, Mark and Randy (Doc). We started this ministry back in 2009. Since then we have seen many young people come to know Christ through His work in our concerts and through His leading through our music. We are passionate about Christ, so much so we make every song about Him. We are not doing what we do to be rock stars, Jesus is the rock star. We merely long to be a reflection of Him. </p><p>We have established this IndieGoGo project to help us fund our new project. It's a 10 song CD of our original music. We believe that these songs will help people to draw closer to Christ. Production these days cost a lot of money. We simply do not have the funds on our own to produce an entire album. We have been able to produce a few songs and Jason has a few solo CD's, but we don't have a full project as the Jason Eaton Band. That's where you can help. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The project we propose will take $20,000. This includes engineering, producing, and creating masters plus about 1000 CD's we can actually sell at shows. Here is the breakdown:</p><p>Engineering/recording: $10000</p><p>Producers: $5000</p><p>Mastering: $1100</p><p>Artwork/Photography: $2000</p><p>Duplication: $1900</p><p>We have levels of contributions that will give you prizes in return for your generosity including a free concert in your back yard or wherever you wish, backstage passes to a years worth of shows, producer credits in the CD jacket and much, much more!</p><p>Even if we don;t reach our goal, we stil will receive the funds generated. We will apply what is given to the costs listed above and if need be, do one or two songs at a time. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We have seen with our latest single, ""Satellites"" a mjor impact to people all over the world. This single has literally crossed the globe and has generated hope to people who need it most. Most notably we received communication from a soldier fighting in Afghanistan who heard the song on radio there and he felt compelled to contact us and let us know how the song impacted him right there on the battlefield. Many others have come forward sawying how much the song had helped them as well. How much more will we be able to help these and others with a full length project. We have so much to share.

<h3>Dear Friends, Family, Strangers and Animals,</h3>
<p>We, Rural Ghosts, are proud to announce the release of our debut full-length album. A year and a half in the making, this record has it all; chills, thrills and cello trills. It has been cleverly entitled ""City of Elms.""</p>
<p>From start to finish, ""City of Elms"" has very much been a project driven by the intention of handling all aspects of the process ourselves. Over a period of 8 months, we recorded, mixed, and mastered the entire album in a variety of rooms throughout the Portland, ME area and at the Oak and the Ax in Biddeford, ME.</p>
<p>The music and artwork for ""City of Elms"" is finished. It is with great sincerity that we hope to release this little bundle of joy on October 1st, 2013, but we're going to need your help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple, really. All we have left to do in order to release this record is duplication. Duplication refers to the printing of the actual CD and packaging.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, printing a run of CDs/packaging costs a fair amount of money. Even more expensive is Vinyl (we would <em>love</em> to press vinyl if we exceed our goal substantially), which is why we're asking for your help. </p>
<p>We're setting our starting goal at $600 in order to cover CD/Packaging duplication, but our hopes are to extend this goal even further. Additional funds will help us to cover the costs of a potential vinyl release, t-shirts/merchandaise, travel and promotion - all of which are necessities for releasing a full-length album. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Have the Nerve to Ask You</h3>
<p>Without getting too sappy here, we really, really love Portland; specifically the music community here. This band has gone through a series of changes ever since the beginning, and our friends/fans have always been supportive the entire way. </p>
<p>We also really love our friends and family who live <em>outside </em>of Portland. Without you guys, we would never have been able to make this record.</p>
<p>In closing, we wish to inform you that our appreciation knows no bounds, and every little bit helps. We're extremely proud of the product we have in our hands right now, and desperately want to get it into yours. </p>
<p>Love always,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign is a big step for me in fully embracing my life's purpose.  It's also about 2 brand new cds coming out at the same time and a full 2014 year of touring.  I would love your support and will be eternally grateful.  </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>2 new cds:</p>
<p>PUTALITTLEMORELOVEINTHEWORLD (full length studio cd)<br/></p>
<p>BELIEVE THE BIRD (an introspective all acoustic cd)&lt;&lt; AT $70 level&gt;&gt;</p>I knew years ago that I am supposed to sing to as many people as I can reach with the full intention of opening hearts and raising consciousness in the world.  I was doing this part-time - enjoying it as a hobby - for many years.  And I most recently took that slightly scary transition into doing this full-time.  Yes!  A full-time transformational musician on a mission!  I would be honored to have you join me.  We need your help to get this music into the daily lives and consciousness of this world in transition.  My music mission states it best...</span><br/><p></p>
<p>I come to you with crystal clear divine purpose. With utmost and sacred devotion, I encapsulate in song my interpretations of the ancient and timeless wisdom of the ascended masters and the contemporary teachers I meet in this life. Each and every song I channel begins as my personal conversation with Source delivered as life lessons of spiritual growth and transformation. Just as these conversations birth expansion, awakening, and remembrance in me, I share my gift to soften the hardest of hearts, widen the narrowest of smiles, loosen the tightest of grips, lighten the heaviest of loads, and thin the thickest of walls of as many souls as I can possibly reach. With passion, conviction and enthusiasm, it is my highest honor to sing from my heart to yours.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is not just to fund a new album (or two albums in this scenario!).  This goes beyond 10-20 songs and will put feet to so many activities that are on the Bob Sima Music to-do list.  It is so exciting to see them come to life - becoming more than just a conceptual thought in my mind, intentional words on a piece of paper, or a beautiful riff from my guitar.  I want to know that I can get more of these messages by integrating this music into more corporate events; scheduling more holistic retreats; partnering with change agents who use this music to compliment their public speeches and raise consciousness in the corporate world. I want to continue my ""gratitude concerts"", these are concerts I perform for free in places where the music is needed the most, like prison's, homeless shelters, and mental health facilities. </p>
<p>Your support will help give life to all these goals and:<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is the reality...this music lives in me and I CAN'T NOT SHARE IT!  I know there is a higher purpose that I don't believe words can accurately describe.  I have a mission and a vision, but I also know that even more will happen when I release and surrender to the unknown and not yet identified opportunities that clearly align with my purpose.  Now that this is my full-time mission, I would be most grateful for your support.  Knowing that you believe this music can truly make a difference and help shift consciousness to make the world a more bountiful and connected experience for all is the fuel that keeps that spark alive in me.  I have never asked for financial support, sponsorship, or backing in the past.  But the time is now.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that you may not be able to financially donate as much as you would like, but I would be most grateful for your help to spread the word.  I know there are angels among us and all it takes is you clicking a share button, posting on social media, sending personal emails to introduce my music or my website or this campaign to all your friends and family.  THANK YOU.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Two Perk Items</h3>
<p>There are two items in the perks that deserve a photo moment here.  The first is a bracelet at the $125 - Ubuntu Love level.  The second is a poster at the $175 - Be The Love level.</p>

Im a self taught Videogame music composer from norway, and ive been making music for almost 9 years now.Ive made music to games like ""Castlecrashers"", ""mecha pumble"" upcomming XBox360, wii and ps3 title ""Castle storm"", and over 80 indie online game titles. Ive released one album called ""Green"", won the musician of the year NG award 2008, and still make music every day, as work and for fun! its my passion. i love it, and hope i dont ever have to stop.
My music is a mix between Upbeat breakbeats and Classical instruments, but people seem to have a hard time placing my music in a genre. its unique in that sense!Ive reached more professional heights in my music career now, and i want to take it to the next step. I have 2 new albums near completion, and offers on playing at live events here and there. And recently i got a offer playing at a festival, late summer 2012! thats what made me realise,sadly, without propper gear, and fundings ill have to turn it all down!I currently have 2 jobs and school, and little money left for anything out of the ordinary.Ive been giving my music out free online, and shared with the creative comunities for videos and games since 2003, and i intend ot keep everything in the future 90% free aswell!I want everyone to feel as overly exited about happy videogame music as i do!That is why i now turn to you, guys, this time i really need your help!Help me share the music!

The Impact
My goal is to play live at the festival late this summer, with my 2 new albums released and behind me!music means the world to me, and my fans mean even more. without you guys i wouldnt be here at all,let alone be so confident in what i do! i want to fulfill the many requests i get of playing live, and releasingmore albums.



What I Need & What You GetThe money goes strictly to music gear and album releases. I aim for getting a responsive, soild drumpad for live performance, A Laptop built for live preformance and music ONLY, and funds to release my new albums.My goal is to reach 2200 dollars in 105 days.If i dont reach my goal, ill try my best to save up and fill in the gaps myself. this thing is going to happen, either way, its just a matter of when, so your money wont go to waste!Any amount is highly appreciated! So please, help a struggeling indie VG composer trying to make a future in the music industry!Ill give out 50 copies ea. of the new albums to the highest contributors over 40 dollars!(its important that you give the correct mail as i will be sending it there when this is over)Aswell as update along the way how the concert process is comming along.

<h3>Hey guys we are Why They Fight!</h3>
<p>We are a pop-punk/powerpop band from Colorado Springs and are currently trying to raise funds for our second EP, ""Empathy"". We released our first EP ""Just Listen"" at the beginning of this summer and have since written a few more songs in a different style. What we're trying to do is be able to pay to put out four new songs as well as two full band acoustic versions of two songs off ""Just Listen"". However, we're broke and being in a band is expensive! So what better way than to ask our fans to help us if they wanted to hear what we've been working on! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We really believe this EP is going to show you guys a different side of our music that we couldn't really cover in ""Just Listen"". We plan on giving you guys a more creative and unique sound while still retaining the sound you have come to enjoy from us. So we really hope that you guys will love what we've come up with! But we do need your help. </p>
<p>We are asking for your assistance to raise a fraction of the actual costs to make this EP happen and release it digitally onto iTunes and Spotify. In return, we will be giving you guys previews of how the work on the EP is going (studio videos and such), some goodies for those who would like to donate through our IndieGoGo campaign, a cover specifically for those who help us out, and more surprises we have brewing up! </p>
<p>Because we're asking for your help, we would like to include you on the whole process of producing ""Empathy"" and make sure that we can show you guys how much your donations mean to us and are helping us as we try to launch our band into the next step.</p>
<p>We love you guys so much and we want to make you proud. </p>

<p>What do you get when you mix faith, art and community development in a bowl, add a dash of acousitical ambiance and shake really hard? Well, we would like to think you get us - February Birds - our musical adventure. </p>
<p>We are Sean and Julie Hall.  We are church planters, artists and activists within the new parish movement. We are married and have two children and make our home in lovely Bellingham, WA. We currently pastor-sojourn with Fountain Parish, a creative and lively new church experimenting with innovative and contextual expressions in the Fountain District of downtown. We have been pastors in both large and small communities and have traveled extensively with our music, but what we are really excited about is creative expression that propels the church into living out God’s dream for our neighborhoods. Many of our songs are used in churches around the world, including the song ""Water"" - a top charting contemporary worship song.</p>
<p>But this batch of songs is different...</p>
<p>These are backyard songs. They are living room songs. Songs that give voice to the new community we have been sojourning with in our neighborhood. These are songs with personalities and faces. Songs with stories attached to them. </p>
<p>And we think they will move you. And maybe even help you dream with God about what he may be doing in your neck of the woods. </p>
<p>By supporting us in this campaign you will help us get imaginative and earthy music into the ears and hearts of many other current pioneers - leaders with imagination who are dreaming with God. Dreaming of what might be on their block. What might be in their work places. What might be in their city centers. What might be in their own homes.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>So you've heard of ""<strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong>"", but want to know more about what it is really?</p>
<p><strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong> was started out of a God-given vision, and has grown into a powerful movement. Its ultimate goal is to see the eradication of evil and this present ""darkness"" that is plaguing our land we love. While you will be able to easily recognize many of the faces on the frontline for the movement, <strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong> is really made up of you... the every day citizen who knows, who believes deep down in your heart, that our country CAN be delivered from its present oppression of evil, restored to what a Godly nation should look like and transformed to put on top and at the forefront those things which are righteous, just, lovely, honest and worthy of good report.</p>
<p>Throughout this nation, there have always been those stalwarts and ""good-thinking"" nationalists among us, who like us have always believed that our beloved country is capable of rising out of the gutters in which it has slumped. These individual voices of reason for years have formed the resistance to the darkness that has crept in. We are in a spiritual and moral warfare, and as silent campaigners for good we have been losing the battle.</p>
<p><strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong> intends to change that!</p>
<p>This movement aims to bring the good and Godly together to take the deranged and destructive mindset by storm, and bring transformation to this nation by the power of the Almighty God... without whom our individual and even collective efforts count for naught.</p>
<p><strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong> is far more than a concert, it's more than the outreach activities and missions that we undertake. We intend to make this an unmistakable lifestyle and mentality brand that galvanizes those that desire the triumph of good over evil to humbly surrender to God while aggressively resisting every advance of that which is evil in this world.</p>
<p>We invite you to join with us, stand with us... be afraid no more, be silent no more, step out with us in Faith and watch God transform this nation and usher its people into <strong>A Betta Tomorrow</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's a quick breakdown of what we are in need of:</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost your support.</li>
<li>Our major event is usually held in November at ""Dump Up Beach"" in Montego Bay, Jamaica.</li>
<li>We also have mini-events in different towns across Jamaica where we stage concerts and meet the needs of people living at the brink or in the depths of poverty.</li>
<li>The total cost of the annual activities are in the region of JA$8 Million or US$80,000.  Most of this is usually donated by the team of persons who believe in the cause.  Our source of funds are for the most part from our own pockets and our own jobs.  We see where the movement has the potential to really have a powerful and lasting positive effect on persons' lives yet, it has become increasingly more difficult to finance this project on our own.  We need your help.</li>
<li>In return for your help we will demonstrate our gratitude with the fruits of our labour - T-Shirts, Albums, Partnerships, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every single dollar that you donate has a definite and lasting impact on the lives of many underprivileged persons and communities.  Please take a look at some of what we have been able to accomplish in the past, and imagine what (with your help) we could accomplish in the future -</p>

Its ultimate goal is to see the eradication of evil and this present ""darkness"" that is plaguing our land we love. While you will be able to easily recognize many of the faces on the frontline for the movement, A Betta Tomorrow is really made up of you... the every day citizen who knows, who believes deep down in your heart, that our country CAN be delivered from its present oppression of evil, restored to what a Godly nation should look like and transformed to put on top and at the forefront those things which are righteous, just, lovely, honest and worthy of good report.
Throughout this nation, there have always been those stalwarts and ""good-thinking"" nationalists among us, who like us have always believed that our beloved country is capable of rising out of the gutters in which it has slumped. These individual voices of reason for years have formed the resistance to the darkness that has crept in. We are in a spiritual and moral warfare, and as silent campaigners for good we have been losing the battle.
A Betta Tomorrow intends to change that!
This movement aims to bring the good and Godly together to take the deranged and destructive mindset by storm, and bring transformation to this nation by the power of the Almighty God... without whom our individual and even collective efforts count for naught.
A Betta Tomorrow is far more than a concert, it's more than the outreach activities and missions that we undertake. We intend to make this an unmistakable lifestyle and mentality brand that galvanizes those that desire the triumph of good over evil to humbly surrender to God while aggressively resisting every advance of that which is evil in this world.
We invite you to join with us, stand with us... be afraid no more, be silent no more, step out with us in Faith and watch God transform this nation and usher its people into A Betta Tomorrow.


What We Need & What You Get
Here's a quick breakdown of what we are in need of:

First and foremost your support.
Our major event is usually held in November at ""Dump Up Beach"" in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
We also have mini-events in different towns across Jamaica where we stage concerts and meet the needs of people living at the brink or in the depths of poverty.
The total cost of the annual activities are in the region of JA$8 Million or US$80,000.  Most of this is usually donated by the team of persons who believe in the cause.  Our source of funds are for the most part from our own pockets and our own jobs.  We see where the movement has the potential to really have a powerful and lasting positive effect on persons' lives yet, it has become increasingly more difficult to finance this project on our own.  We need your help.
In return for your help we will demonstrate our gratitude with the fruits of our labour - T-Shirts, Albums, Partnerships, etc.



The Impact
Every single dollar that you donate has a definite and lasting impact on the lives of many underprivileged persons and communities.  Please take a look at some of what we have been able to accomplish in the past, and imagine what (with your help) we could accomplish in the future -

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Dead Whale Ramblers, a DIY folk band from Baltimore, Maryland, have finished recording our second album, entitled Eight of Swords. We've recorded this album entirely on a shoestring budget of $0.00 and with the much appreciated help of our friend Ian Jones. However, there's more to be done! Now we need your help to put the finishing touches on the album and get it professionally mastered so that we can release it for the world to enjoy!</p>
<p>We appreciate all contributions to the completion of our album. Thanks so much for supporting us in what we love to do! </p>
<p>The Dead Whale Ramblers started i<span>n 2009 on Assateague Island, where the wild ponies run free. In the beginning we were just two friends playing music together, but we quickly acquired more members and have been slowly evolving ever since. </span>The Dead Whale Ramblers are:</p>
<p>Madi Shapiro: guitar, accordion, vocals</p>
<p>Sam Kipnes: mandolin, double bass, glockenspiel, percussion, backup vocals</p>

If we recieve more funding than we need for this album, rest assured that all funds will go towards future Dead Whale Ramblers releases and merchandise, including the possibility of pressing the album to vinyl!</p>
<p>The biggest perk for contributing to this campaign is getting to see our album come to fruition, but if you contribute a certain amount of money you can receive perks such as DWR t-shirts, posters, a finished, signed copy of our album, and more!

<h3>Hey everyone!</h3>
<p>    Much time has passed since my last musical endeavor or official release for that matter (Field Trip, No Rules, RCA), but that time has finally come!  I am about to embark on the journey of recording my first solo record right here in beautiful Ojai, CA..  I have over the years continued to be very active both musically and creatively and have amassed a body of work that I feel is ready to be heard by you, my adoring public. lol For those of you who don't know who I am, I was the lead singer in the rock band Kik Tracee on RCA back in the early 90's.  I have obviously grown not only as a person but as an artist since then and what you'll be hearing on this debut is a direct result of the experiences, trials, tribulations, good, bad, the ugly and beautiful of the last decade or so.  For the ever loyal KT fans who are still out there and I know you are because of your endless, weekly facebook messages and friendings, this record will in some way be a field trip down memory lane of sorts or an experience entirely new I'm sure.  EIther way I think all will be pleasantly surprised as well as myself!  lol  Recording has already begun on this project as I was able to come up with the down payment so as to get started which there in leaves the balance.  I'm going it alone on this one, no major label, or budget to work with which is why I'm turning to this incredible resource of indiegogo for some of the financing of this project. The objective here is to raise funds to help in the production, recording, mixing, and mastering of this record!  So whether you are a new fan or one of the many loyal old, a family member or friend, any support or contribution to this indiegogo campaign for my art and sanity's sake would be forever greatly appreciated.  </p>
<p>    I will be offering some perks as incentive which are essentially pre-order single and full length album downloads and some signed items such as artwork etc... so please check those out!  Otherwise, many thanks to those who have championed my cause in the past and thanks to those who will help propel my musical future!  I look forward to seeing you all in the near future out on the road at a venue near you!</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone. We're Brooklyn-based band Time Travelers, and you're our new best friend.  Our band, consisting of Edward Sturtevant, Andrew Wilcox, Alex Koster, and Ben Latham, has been playing in and around the 5 boroughs for the last year and a half, and we're finally ready to record our next EP.  </p>
<p>This is where you come in.  While we have some funds to get this process started, we could really use your help to complete it the right way.  We've teamed up with Fraser McCulloch, who will be working with us for the month of February (read more about it here: <a href=""http://frasermcculloch.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://frasermcculloch.tumblr.com/</a>), and we'll be recording in a few different spaces around Brooklyn, most notably at The End studio (<a href=""http://www.theendnyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.theendnyc.com/</a>).  Once we've tracked and mastered all the songs, we'll be making physical copies of the CD (yes, ones you can hold in your hand!), complete with color artwork, liner notes, and the sturdiest jewel case money can buy! While we've recorded two previous EPs (<a href=""http://timetravelers.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">timetravelers.bandcamp.com</a>, if you're interested), this will be the first professionally executed one.  This is a huge step for us as a band, and we want you to be a part of it. </p>

<h2>About us.</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name is Teevi Zeemann and my twin sister is Teesi Zeemann. We are both currently studying photography in Tallinn Polytechnic school and have huge passion for that particular type of art. The reason why we are here writing to you guys is our dad.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Our dad has had the vision of this photographic project for quite some time now. But he told me and my sister about this idea almost 3 years ago. It sounded extremely fascinating and at that moment his vision became our dream. We decided to put our knowledge, skills and passion to this project and make it happen.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is going to be a moment, when people around the world take out their cameras and <strong>capture THE moment</strong>, wherever they happen to be. I am sure that lot of us have been wondering what is happening on the other side of the world at the <span style=""""></span>same exact time and even a moment. Our world is very interesting and controversial – somewhere the sun is shining, elswhere is darkness of the night, someone has joy, someone else sorrow.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It is our goal to bring this information <span style=""""> </span>to every corner on this earth and receive as many different photos as possible. This is a nonprofit event and our goal is to join the world and notify mankind – the world we live in is so different, but also the same for all of us!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The one moment will be on <strong>14th of September at 13:00 o’clock UTC/GMT.</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Find out what time you need to take the photo in your country: <br/></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><strong><a href=""http://goo.gl/HVsohk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/HVsohk</a><br/></strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So everyone has the opportunity to register until the 14th of Septmeber on our website. Registration is important so we can see in which countries we have enough participants and which countries need more attention.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://onemomentworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://onemomentworld.com/</a></strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Now the part why we need Your financial help.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We collect the most soulful and fascinating pictures from every country and open the exhibition.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The big exhibition will be first opened in Tallinn, Estonia. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That requires:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"" style="""">
<span style=""font-family: Symbol;""><span style=""""><strong>·</strong><span style=""font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';""><strong>       </strong>  </span></span></span><strong>Printing about 500 photos on PVC board</strong>
</li>
<li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"" style=""""><strong><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·<span style="""">         </span></span>Photo screens</strong></li>
<li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"" style="""">
<strong><span style=""font-family: Symbol;"">·<span style="""">         </span></span>Giant earth globe that rotates</strong> – this is going to be center piece of the exhibiton where people can see by the marks where the certain picture was taken.</li>
</ul>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So it is going to be expensive event because this big earth globe itself is going to be about $5500</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Also we need funding for printing and publishing <strong>the book</strong> with all the pictures inside. So you would be able to order and see the whole world in one book!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Every single one of You, who helps us to raise the money will be acknowledged by the name on our facebook account, on exhibitions or in the book! Depending on the leve of your contribution.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/8937/files/20130813030302-atlantahall2.jpg?1376388182"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<h2><br/></h2>

My name is Teevi Zeemann and my twin sister is Teesi Zeemann. We are both currently studying photography in Tallinn Polytechnic school and have huge passion for that particular type of art. The reason why we are here writing to you guys is our dad.
Our dad has had the vision of this photographic project for quite some time now. But he told me and my sister about this idea almost 3 years ago. It sounded extremely fascinating and at that moment his vision became our dream. We decided to put our knowledge, skills and passion to this project and make it happen.
It is going to be a moment, when people around the world take out their cameras and capture THE moment, wherever they happen to be. I am sure that lot of us have been wondering what is happening on the other side of the world at the same exact time and even a moment. Our world is very interesting and controversial – somewhere the sun is shining, elswhere is darkness of the night, someone has joy, someone else sorrow.
It is our goal to bring this information  to every corner on this earth and receive as many different photos as possible. This is a nonprofit event and our goal is to join the world and notify mankind – the world we live in is so different, but also the same for all of us!
The one moment will be on 14th of September at 13:00 o’clock UTC/GMT.
Find out what time you need to take the photo in your country: 
http://goo.gl/HVsohk
So everyone has the opportunity to register until the 14th of Septmeber on our website. Registration is important so we can see in which countries we have enough participants and which countries need more attention.


http://onemomentworld.com/
 
What We Need & What You Get
Now the part why we need Your financial help.

We collect the most soulful and fascinating pictures from every country and open the exhibition.
The big exhibition will be first opened in Tallinn, Estonia. 
That requires:


·         Printing about 500 photos on PVC board

·         Photo screens

·         Giant earth globe that rotates – this is going to be center piece of the exhibiton where people can see by the marks where the certain picture was taken.

So it is going to be expensive event because this big earth globe itself is going to be about $5500
 
Also we need funding for printing and publishing the book with all the pictures inside. So you would be able to order and see the whole world in one book!
 
Every single one of You, who helps us to raise the money will be acknowledged by the name on our facebook account, on exhibitions or in the book! Depending on the leve of your contribution.





The Impact
The goal is to see, how controversial, exciting and different the world is on the exact same time but in different places. And what better way to visualize it than through the pictures.
By now we have a confirmational that one of the pictures is even coming from out of space! 





Other Ways You Can Help

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>After experiencing countless obstacles hindering their ability to fund their project, A Tragic Setback has turned to YOU, the beautiful face sitting behind this computer/smartphone screen, for help.</p>
<p>We are an unsigned rock/metal band from San Antonio, Texas, and have decided to do our first album, videos, and other promotion, entirely out-of-pocket, without the support of a record label.</p>
<p>Though ""it's a long way to the top"", we care only about music. We could care less about large profits because we are truly passionate about the music we make, the crowd our music captures, and the lives our music inspires.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BUT MOST OF ALL, we are dedicating this album to little Elena Hope Arenas, our singer's young daughter who had just passed away last year.</p>
<p>We want to do every thing possible to make our album ""Chasing the Light"" special, in her memory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your support, WE WILL make this dream come true, and then some!</p>

<p>Namaste :)</p>
<p>   We are so very grateful for your arrival on our fundraising page, and for your love and support!  Whatever level you are able to donate at, or even if you're just coming here to grab this page's link to share with friends, we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.  Deep Stirrings will be able to put our music out into the world because of your generosity!  If you are making a donation at one of the suggested amounts and wish to choose a Perk, I look forward to getting your Perk to you, and hearing how you enjoyed it!<br/><br/>   Deep Stirrings has been playing for festivals, causes, charities, public venues, bars, etc. around SoCal for years, and a few years ago we started going to a recording studio to get our first full length album done.  By throwing in what band members could afford, along with some generous donations from a few friends, we were able to get 3 tracks finished, which appear on our cd single ""El Viaje"".  We also produced our music video (seen above), thanks to friends volunteering their talents, to promote the single.  After countless hours in the studio, and thousands of dollars already spent, we have a little done on every song, but MUCH more recording left to do, followed by mixing and mastering.  With 7 people in a band, recording takes a lot of time and resources.</p>
<p>   $3000 will help a great deal with recording our album.  It will probably cost twice that amount, but I wanted to set a reachable goal.  Having said that, please know that if you have landed on this page and we have been blessed to hit our first goal, we are still very much in need of donations, and will be eternally grateful for any amount you choose to donate!<br/>   If you would like to write a check, just email or call Alec and let him know which Perk you'd like.  If you'd prefer to Paypal, send directly using <a href=""mailto:aleccm@earthlink.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">aleccm@earthlink.net</a> (Alec's email addy), and let him know  which Perk you'd like :)</p>
<p>   As you know if you've seen our live shows, especially our charity related gigs, we are out to make a difference.  Some of our songs are about love and relationships, while others are about human rights, environment, animal rights, peace, and consciousness.  By helping enable us to finish our album, you are helping us fulfill our callings both to entertain, and to inspire/raise awareness/reach out to our fellow humans who want to collaborate on making this world a more loving place.  We certainly like to have a good time with our audiences.  We also like to contribute what we can to building concsiousness in our local and global communities!</p>
   As expressions of our gratitude, there is probably really something for everyone in our Perks menu.  From Bands &amp; Bellies tickets to baked goods to lessons to private shows, you have 20 Perks to choose from.  It's flexible too, because you can donate at any amount of your choosing, even greater or smaller than listed amounts, and then choose whichever Perks you qualify for.  To those of you who live too far away for most of our Perks, or who simply wish to donate without choosing one, we send you an extra special hug and thank you :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>   Please do use the Indigogo share tools, and/or pass this page's link around to your contacts.  If nothing else, they'll probably enjoy the music video, but maybe they'll join you and Deep Stirrings in this campaign!</div>

</div></div>","Greetings family,
As many of you know, music is a integral part of my life and I have worked in the field for some time. With time comes experience and change, I realize the industry of music has changed dramatically. I strive to spread a positive message in every one of my recordings and stage shows. As a rehabilitated ""gangster rapper"" as Nutmeg http://www.amazon.com/Ghettos-Child-Nutmeg/dp/B000008Q3R I know I have something special to share. I believe that if you find purpose for your life , you should definately follow the path in that purpose. That is what this campaign is about, having the opportunity to follow that path. 
 I currently help other artists to follow thier path as well , locally, by way of a monthly all-women showcase, The Feminine Project https://www.facebook.com/TheFeminineProjectMusicShowcase?ref=hl this has been an enjoyable venture. However, I have to grow my own career as well. That is where you come in.
  Being an independent artist, and without a record deal, it means I must do everything out of my pocket, or with sponsorship. I know the challenges and I am happy to say that due to some good internet marketing on our part, I have a growing following around the country. The problem is, I miss many engagements because I live in Arizona and cannot yet afford to travel back and forth to the East Coast (where I am invited frequently).

<p>Thank you so much for checking out my campaign! My name is Rachel Adams. I am an urban pop recording artist from South Florida. In the spring of 2013 I will be graduating from Berklee College of Music. Emerald Heart is a reflection of my life and I can't wait to share it with you guys. My team and I have poured our hearts and souls into this. We can't wait to get in the studio to start recording, but... we need your help!!!</p>
<p><strong>I am inviting all of my friends, family and fans to help play an important role in this project by joining my team and I to help spread the word and raise funds. </strong></p>
<p>Your financial support is extremely important to me. It will help pay for production costs such as producers, engineers, world class musicians, and videographers as well as pay for studio time, manufacturing, and distribution. If by some miracle, we raise more money than asked for, those funds will go towards touring, radio/promotion, merchandise, copyrights and a kickass release party where I can invite all of you to hear my album live for the first time!! :)</p>
<p><strong>If you cant afford to donate, I would be equally as appreciative if you would pass the word along to anyone you know who might be interested. Any amount of money makes the biggest difference. </strong></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our names are Troy Hepler and Joe Vergara. We are two college students who grew up in the different parts of the midwest and moved out to Orlando, Florida to go to school where we met.

<h3>Our Goal </h3>

<p>Luciano Berio (1925-2003) was one of the great composers of the late 20th century.  His solo Sequenza works for fourteen different instruments are some of the most technically and physically demanding pieces written.  They also happen to be wildly entertaining.</p>
<p>This is where you come in!  We are fortunate to have performance spaces provided to us free of charge.  Our musicians are currently donating many hours of their daily schedules to learning this incredibly difficult pieces.  We need to compensate them for their stunning generosity in time, artistry, and hours of -(maybe not blood)-, but definitely sweat and tears.  Our musicians hail from the International Contemporary Ensemble, Ensemble ACJW, the Declassified, Juilliard, Manhattan School, Oberlin Conservatory, and Rice University and many more prestigious organizations, and perform all over the world.  A very special treat to us and you is that our accordionist, Bill Schimmel,  was a long-time friend of the composer himself, and performed the New York premeire of Sequenza XIII !</p>
<p>In addition to compensating our performers, we have a minimal publicity cost of $250.</p>
<p>Your money will go directly to the musicians, where it will have the most impact.  By supporting them, you are showing them that the work they do is highly valuable to all of us!  Once our goal is reached, you are encouraged to keep giving.  Every extra penny will be greatly appreciated!</p>

Luciano Berio (1925-2003) was one of the great composers of the late 20th century.  His solo Sequenza works for fourteen different instruments are some of the most technically and physically demanding pieces written.  They also happen to be wildly entertaining.
This is where you come in!  We are fortunate to have performance spaces provided to us free of charge.  Our musicians are currently donating many hours of their daily schedules to learning this incredibly difficult pieces.  We need to compensate them for their stunning generosity in time, artistry, and hours of -(maybe not blood)-, but definitely sweat and tears.  Our musicians hail from the International Contemporary Ensemble, Ensemble ACJW, the Declassified, Juilliard, Manhattan School, Oberlin Conservatory, and Rice University and many more prestigious organizations, and perform all over the world.  A very special treat to us and you is that our accordionist, Bill Schimmel,  was a long-time friend of the composer himself, and performed the New York premeire of Sequenza XIII !
In addition to compensating our performers, we have a minimal publicity cost of $250.
Your money will go directly to the musicians, where it will have the most impact.  By supporting them, you are showing them that the work they do is highly valuable to all of us!  Once our goal is reached, you are encouraged to keep giving.  Every extra penny will be greatly appreciated!
Concert I: October 11, 7:30pm. Pete's Candy Store (Brooklyn).  Sequenzas I (flute), V (trombone), VI (viola), VIII (violin), XIV (bass)
Concert II: October 25, 7:30pm. Pete's Candy Store.  Sequenzas II (harp) III (voice), IX (clarinet), XI (guitar)
Concert III: November 10, 4pm. Caffe Vivaldi (Manhattan).  Sequenzas I (flute), II (harp), IV (piano), V (trombone), IX (clarinet), XIII (accordion), XIV (double bass)
Concert IV: November 11, 4pm. Caffe Vivaldi.  Sequenzas III (voice), VI (viola), VII (oboe), VIII (violin), X (trumpet), XII (guitar), XII (bassoon)

</div></div>","Why crowd source?Although our imagination is grand, and we have done some amazing things, we do have our financial limits.  We have booked three days of eclectic and rare live music and performance spanning instrument builders, multimedia artists, turntablists, industrial music that covers the breadth of the genre, break core, ambient, idm, video artists, djs and performers who can hardly be compared to anyone else on earth.This is not an inexpensive undertaking. Hotels and flights alone cost many thousands of dollars before the show begins.  Instead of going to traditional investors who typically care more about their return than the art, we are going directly to you, the enthusiasts, who will respect and appreciate that we are doing this campaign to give all of you that know our history, and those who don't, a chance to get your tickets early and at the lowest price while supporting the artform[s] you love..Please support this ongoing art movement by donating to our 25th Anniversary event!Looking backWe already know that we can accomplish a great deal on our own.  We have hosted multimedia circuses, multi-day music, multimedia and performance art festivals, producing club nights involving live drummers triggering video lighting and lasers, and on and on.  Here's some clips from past shows that we've produced.And what do we give you for your support?We have only 50 reduced price three day passes, a limited number of shirts, and a limited edition specially packaged numbered usb flash drive compilation that will feature hours of material including exclusive tracks and videos from most of the performers plus never before seen footage from Voidstar Productions' archives from past shows and more.Who's playing this festival?As of the time of the campaign launch we have been announcing an artist a day.We have recently announced our complete line up. We are proud to announce the following artists:Abstinence [NY - industrial]

What is unique about this festival?
Voidstar Productions has a long history of unusual event productions with high standards and strong practices for giving the audience experiences that they will rarely find elsewhere with minimal time wasted from the time doors open to the end of the night.  One artists that we have booked has described the way we operate as like a military campaign.
There are no opening acts and shows often start off with surprises.  We have legendary acts that have asked about playing this festival after it was already booked solid, so there's no point to waste a moment on booking any filler bands that don't bring something special to your experience.
Past surprises have included:* Author and Punisher doing an extra set to debut a new project that at the time was called Women and Children.  This latter evolved into tracks that are on his album of the same name.* Not Breathing and Raab Codec's only live collaboration.* Pine Tree State Mind Control's destructive crowd participation street performance.* Surprise performances by numerous artists.* Many rare collaborative performances at past shows.
We play with the environment and experience.  This includes setting up performers to play back to back from different locations, installations, use of video and performance artists, and more.
The artists line up order is a secret that is built around the experience as a whole rather than the typical unknown opener starting and big draw headliner closing.
Popularity alone doesn't interest us.  We have been uncompromising about our art for the entirety of our history and we wont stop now.  We take pride in how often people say they were blown away by the artists that they didn't know on our lineups which happens far more often than not.",0.0,8,"1 Campaign

<p>If you don't know us, we are a Americana pop/rock duo based out of Washington D.C. We met at a young artist songwriter showcase in D.C. in 2010, and since then, have been performing and co-writing music. Show after show fans have asked for a way to hear and share this music, however, so far we have only been able to produce a few demos. Well, now it is time for that to change. We have the opportunity to record the songs that we have put our hearts and souls into....we just need <b>you </b>in order to make it happen.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to work with the highly reputable producer, Mark Williams, at Sucker Punch Recording Co. in Bethesda, Maryland who will help us create a professional product that we will all be extremely proud of. Everything is in order and we are ready to get started. The only problem is that we need to be able to pay for the incredible services that we will receive at Sucker Punch, and right now this is not something that we can handle on our own. That's where you come in!<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My Name is Uneq'ka I am a Singer, songwriter, teacher, and artist.  i have taught music and art all over Chicago in schools and community organizations. i also have several projects on iTunes and Amazon. Throughout the years of teaching I saw first hand how positive music can inspire and help to change negative situations and people.  I am campaigning to give Music and art to a community that is desperately in need of positive energy.  Living in Englewood i have seen some of the most violent situation with tragic outcome, I also have seen lives transformed with a little hope and inspiration.  I have completed a project that has the elements of hope, love, life and perseverance. Your contribution will help to get this music and message out in the community, to other communities all while documenting the process on film for TV and internet. It is important to show the positive change that is happening so that it can spread. Poverty and violence is a conditional mindset that can be changed.<br/></p>
<p>If my goal is reached or not every cent will go into producing and distributing the music and art that will inspire, to filming and continuing to run grassroots programs on the streets of Englewood and throughout Chicago. Anyone who can contribute will receive one or more of the following:  CD Collection, Downloads, art prints, a thank you/mention on our film or tickets to a live show to personally thank you. We need your help please spread the word. The video is an example of a the change that has happened with music right here in my neighborhood. Please help us spread this change.<br/></p>

</h3><div>
<p>The 39th annual National Women's Music Festival will held at the Madison Marriott West Conference Center in Middleton WI June 26-29, 2014. All of the performers, workshop presenters and festival staff are women. And, unlike other Women's Festival that are held in the great outdoors, the National Festival inherently costs more because all of the stages, workshops and other events are in a climate-controlled conference center.<strong>Women In the Arts is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization</strong> whose purpose is to produce and sponsor programs that promote and affirm the creative talents and technical skills of women in the visual, performing, and fine arts. The primary vehicle to meet this purpose is the production of the National Women’s Music Festival. In producing this and other arts programs, WIA strives to facilitate the growth, knowledge, and empowerment of women in the other varied aspects of their lives. <br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need From You</strong></h3>
<p>We work very hard to keep our expenses to a minimum, but like everything else the costs of travel and accommodations increase every year. This year, the cost of travel and hotel accommodations for performers, presenters, and staff will be close to $20,000.00.<br/><br/>Donor contributions will pay for transportation, housing and food for over 35 women performers at the festival.  Your donation also means that we don't have to include the cost of travel and hotel in our determination of the price of a 4-day festival pass. It helps us keep the cost a 4-day festival pass within the range that a majority of women can afford to pay.</p>
<h3><strong><strong>How We will Thank You</strong></strong></h3>
<p>Please review the list of perks that you will receive for your donation. We will list your name in the program booklet with your perk. For example: if you donated $75 for Luggage fees; we will state that you paid for the transportation of Linda Tillery's drums to the Festival. Or, if you donated $200 we will state that you paid for Lucie Blue's transportation to the festival. We will have a list available of the artists and what it costs for their travel and lodging. You can choose whose transportation or lodging costs you would like to say that you sponsored.  So, the earlier that you donate the more likely you will be able to sponsor the artist of your choice.</p>
<h3><strong><strong><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></strong></strong></h3>
<p>Please pass the word via Facebook posts, Tweets, Tumbler, LinkedIn and/or e-mails.  Make some noise about the 39th Annual National Women's Music Festival and our campaign for sponsors. </p>
<p><b>The Women in the Arts Board appreciate your help.</b></p>

My name is Gershon Hamel, and I am a gospel artist, songwriter,
producer and musician from Pensacola, Florida. This will be my first solo
project and I want to share the experience with you.
                            

Music if nothing else has been the greatest and most stable thing in my life. I started playing drums around 8 or 9 months of age and the journey has gone from there. All the music I have made is original and that’s something I take much pride in and now I am ready to share this part of me with you. I am very diverse and have studies all types of music, so I don’t think there will be a dull moment on this album or tour.
· 
This ALBUM will have 10-12 ORIGIANL songs 
· 
I need to be able to PAY for my beat producers for all of their
hard work 
· 
I want to share my work with YOU.
· 
I want to record a VIDEO for one of the songs

I am super proud of what I have been able to do thus far but I have never been as excited about a project as I am now. This will be my first ever LIVE recording! I have done live studio sessions, but never with a live audience and I can not wait to track with that energy in the room. We will be tracking this album LIVE at Ignited Church on <b>May 15th, 2016</b>.</p>
<p>I love studio albums because of how creative and layered one can get with multi-tracking... BUT I have always longed to capture a live project for many years. There is something so special about capturing a moment in time/history. If you know me at all you know that I shine in a live atmosphere. Worshiping together with a group of people, especially a church family, it just pulls something different out of you. I can't wait to see what moments we capture that night. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I actually don't have a title for this album yet. This is different for me. I've always known or at least had an idea of what I wanted an album to be titled before I started. The title for this project, I believe, is going to come to after it is tracked and I get to hear it. Something about listening to the moments captured is going to give the title to me. Looking forward to that process. </span></p>
<p>I am stepping out in faith to do this project. All I have at this moment is a word from the Lord to do it. As some of you may know, I haven't done a solo project since 2013. ""Beautiful Questions"" was such an amazing part of my life and I am proud of how that record came out. Since then, I have dedicated myself to to Ignited Church in Lakeland FL. We have been developing a community of Worship Leaders and Musicians for the past 3 1/2 years. It has gone far beyond what I could have dreamed. We have recorded 2 albums together ""Wake Us Up"" &amp; ""Mirrors."" These albums have been part of my discipleship process for the people the Lord has entrusted me to lead. Both of those records are babies. They feel and mean something so different to me because they were done in community, for a community, and that is something special. </p>
<p>So here I am now. Ready to record my 3rd album in a 1 year gap of time. THAT'S A LITTLE CRAZY! But I know it's the Lord. I felt the Holy Spirit impress on me that it was time to do a personal project and it needed to be live. So I have started making plans, writing songs, setting dates, scheduled a band, and am doing pre-production currently. I am stepping out in faith, yet again, to do what I am hearing from the Lord. The Father has honored me every time I have done this in my life and I know that He will do it again. </p>

YOU, my friends, and my family, can partner with me even before we start! I love this. Indiegogo allows me to accomplish something that I could not do on my own by partnering with you. Through this partnership you will receive different kinds of Perks that are listed on the side of this page. Please look through them and choose what you would desire.

I do believe that these Perks are rewarding and can't wait to get them in your hands. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to even view this. It means the world to me that you would consider partnering with me on this album.

Any funds that come in over and above the $6,000 mark will be funneled straight into the project as well. Everyone woking with me on this project is committed to it out of relationship. From producers, engineers, venue, equipment, album design, replication, etc. 
Albums take a lot of money, time, and effort. Here is just a short list of what the money will be going to:  Equipment Rental
Tracking Engineers
Musicians
Producers
Album Design 
Replication
Copyrights 
Overdubs
Food (Mainly Pizza;-)    The Other Way You Can Give: If you would prefer to write a check that would be Tax Deductible you can make it out to:

<p></p><h3>New CD</h3>
<p>I’ve just started
recording my first full-length studio album in 10 years. It’s called “When You’re
Happy” and I’m very excited about it. Along with the help of my recording
engineer, I’ve enlisted some of the top local musicians, including Billy Novick and Todd Glacy. </p>
<p>There will also be a
live track of one of my newer songs, “Where is Everybody?”</p>
<p>Also on the CD is my
latest baseball song, “The Ballad of Mike Hessman,” the bittersweet tale of a ballplayer
who set the all-time minor league record for home runs. Hessman spent 19 years
in the minors so his achievement is a great feat as well as a dubious distinction.</p>
<p>In addition, I’m re-recording
five of my favorite songs that were previously available only as live tracks. A
brand new studio version of “My Baby Can’t Parallel Park” is included. You may
have heard this song on NPR’s Car Talk.  </p>
<p>Here’s the complete
lineup:</p>
<p>My Baby Can’t Parallel
Park</p>
<p>Our Kids Aren’t Kids
Anymore</p>

<p>Recording, mastering and
mixing a studio album can be expensive so I’m looking to pre-sell some CDs to
cover those costs. There are also expenses involved with design, artwork and
pressing the actual CDs.</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to
use this campaign to generate some buzz so getting the music “out there” will
really help. It’s going to be a great album!  </p>
<p>I’m offering big
discounts and combo offers to help launch this project so you’ll be getting some
great music in exchange for your support.</p>

really enjoy performing and would appreciate some help in introducing new people

<p>Hi, my name is MC Blackwolf.  God, that's so formal, MC Blackwolf was my father's name, call me Blackwolf.  I'm a rapper out of Fishtown/Port Richmond area Philadelphia where I frequently play shows.  I haven't released a song since 2011 because nothing in the interim has been good enough.  My inner critic has gotten a lot of work, and has very harshly judged all attempts to create a solid project.  I finally think that I have  wrestled my demons enough to make something that I am truly proud of.  I finally found my sound.  If you've seen me live (as Blackwolf or in my group Kim Jong Ill) then you know that I am all about energy.  Its a weird energy, but there's a lot of it.  That is something that was really important for me to capture on this EP and I think I just may have succeeded.</p>
<p>This campaign is meant to fund 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical Copies of the [Redacted] EP </li>
<li>Blackwolf Tshirts</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, it seems a bit weird to use a bullet list for only two items, but that's how excited I am about this project.</p>

<p>With recording just completed on Monday, January 28th, here is the breakdown of where the money we raise (YOUR donations) will be going!:</p>
<p><strong>Costs that MUST be covered:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Studio (Recording/Mixing): $1,300<br/>Pressing CDs: $300<br/>Original Posters: $100<br/>Rights to Music &amp; Distribution: $100<br/>Indiegogo Fees: $245</strong></p>
<p><strong>30% of ALL FUNDS RAISED will be going to these two causes:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>ECMS Student Scholarship Donation: $525<br/>Free Clinic Donation: $525<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> What we'd like to pay those who are currently working for FREE:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Studio Musicians: $300<br/>CD Design: $50<br/>Additional Advertising: $55<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>= $3,500</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help us reach our goal!! Here is the story of ""The Unsung"":</strong></p>
<p>            After a year-and-a-half of dealing with a crumbling hip, followed by surgery and recovery—which my surgeon at Mayo responded, “I could have dreamed the perfect surgery and recovery and it wouldn’t have gone this well"" —I found myself feeling ten years younger (putting me at 36), but bereft of new musical material of my own. At the same time, I see a music industry bereft of real talent, unless one looks to the independent artists, the unsung, and the somewhat obscure songs of better-known artists. I was chomping at the bit to get back to work in the studio, and ready to take a long hiatus from live performance.</p>
<p>            I have many friends whose music far out-shines that of the “mainstream” you hear on corporate radio any given day. One afternoon, I was listening to the work of one such songwriter who had long-since given me permission to record his work. Then it struck me… why not record an album of cover songs by lesser-known artists and lesser-known songs by a couple well-known names? Thus began the project I dubbed “The Unsung”.</p>
<p>            As I promptly got to work at <a href=""http://pinehollowaudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pine Hollow Audio</a> outside Eau Claire, Wisconsin, run by <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=180057018694727&amp;story_fbid=422588977774862"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Evan Middlesworth</a> whose generosity towards music education has given his name to a music scholarship program (of which a student of mine was a recipient), it dawned on me. If I’m going to take some time off from live performance, why not go out with a bang. I looked at two possibilities for causes I could contribute to: <a href=""http://www.cvfreeclinic.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Chippewa Valley Free Clinic</a> (who provide myself and other uninsured patients with the healthcare they desperately need) and <a href=""http://www.eauclairemusicschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Eau Claire Music School</a> (where I teach) and their music scholarship program for underprivileged middle school students who show great talent, but haven’t the means to pay for private coaching.</p>
<p>            Knowing that a project such as this can build a greater network for the artists involved—who are ignored by an industry ignorant of most great talent—and contribute to a clinic that needs $2000 a month just to open the doors and buy prescriptions (even at a highly discounted rate), and the thought that I could help pay for scholarships to music education; I jumped on the idea. As I write this, several songs are either complete and awaiting the final mix or are near to being finished. The album will also include in its byline information that will further promote the causes of The CV Free Clinic and the ECMS Scholarship Program. Additionally, when the CD is released at my last live show (for an indefinite period of time), money from the door, raffles and a piece of the ring at the bar will all be included in donations to these causes.</p>
<p>            What can I offer you in return, other than the satisfaction of supporting the independent songwriters covered on this album, and giving to a free clinic and a music school? I’m offering many perks; from signed CDs to DVDs of live shows, and even the opportunity for me to play your private event, featuring the entire album live, along with hours of other material. Look over the levels of donations and understand that any amount is appreciated. Additionally, should you choose an amount in between the various suggested levels, ask what you can receive... the bottom line here, is not, the bottom line. This is all about building an on-going community and contributing to the needs of all of us; whether we're in need of health care, an education in music, or the one thing none of us lives without... music itself. We're all on this road together.</p>
<p>            I hope you’ll see this as an opportunity to be a part of the tremendous musical community available in this country and the world.  If only we all could look for something better… whether it’s providing the means that so many others lack, or bringing lesser known and highly talented artists and lesser known, but brilliant, songs to the public at large. Support “The Unsung”, The Chippewa Valley Free Clinic, and The Eau Claire Music School’s Student Scholarship Program, all with one donation of your choosing.</p>
<p>            I thank you on behalf of everyone involved. If you don’t have the means to donate, I encourage you to do as I do and give back in other ways. Please feel free to spread the word by sharing this page throughout your own networks.</p>

One afternoon, I was listening to the work of one such songwriter who had long-since given me permission to record his work. Then it struck me… why not record an album of cover songs by lesser-known artists and lesser-known songs by a couple well-known names? Thus began the project I dubbed “The Unsung”.
            As I promptly got to work at Pine Hollow Audio outside Eau Claire, Wisconsin, run by Evan Middlesworth whose generosity towards music education has given his name to a music scholarship program (of which a student of mine was a recipient), it dawned on me. If I’m going to take some time off from live performance, why not go out with a bang. I looked at two possibilities for causes I could contribute to: The Chippewa Valley Free Clinic (who provide myself and other uninsured patients with the healthcare they desperately need) and The Eau Claire Music School (where I teach) and their music scholarship program for underprivileged middle school students who show great talent, but haven’t the means to pay for private coaching.
            Knowing that a project such as this can build a greater network for the artists involved—who are ignored by an industry ignorant of most great talent—and contribute to a clinic that needs $2000 a month just to open the doors and buy prescriptions (even at a highly discounted rate), and the thought that I could help pay for scholarships to music education; I jumped on the idea. As I write this, several songs are either complete and awaiting the final mix or are near to being finished. The album will also include in its byline information that will further promote the causes of The CV Free Clinic and the ECMS Scholarship Program. Additionally, when the CD is released at my last live show (for an indefinite period of time), money from the door, raffles and a piece of the ring at the bar will all be included in donations to these causes.
            What can I offer you in return, other than the satisfaction of supporting the independent songwriters covered on this album, and giving to a free clinic and a music school? I’m offering many perks; from signed CDs to DVDs of live shows, and even the opportunity for me to play your private event, featuring the entire album live, along with hours of other material. Look over the levels of donations and understand that any amount is appreciated. Additionally, should you choose an amount in between the various suggested levels, ask what you can receive... the bottom line here, is not, the bottom line. This is all about building an on-going community and contributing to the needs of all of us; whether we're in need of health care, an education in music, or the one thing none of us lives without... music itself. We're all on this road together.
            I hope you’ll see this as an opportunity to be a part of the tremendous musical community available in this country and the world.  If only we all could look for something better… whether it’s providing the means that so many others lack, or bringing lesser known and highly talented artists and lesser known, but brilliant, songs to the public at large. Support “The Unsung”, The Chippewa Valley Free Clinic, and The Eau Claire Music School’s Student Scholarship Program, all with one donation of your choosing.
            I thank you on behalf of everyone involved. If you don’t have the means to donate, I encourage you to do as I do and give back in other ways. Please feel free to spread the word by sharing this page throughout your own networks.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

We've now found ourselves in an exciting place - the moment when the harvest is ripe for an album to be made that reflects the direction, ethos, and path of the group!</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We think that, together, we've found something worth sharing, and hope that you'll consider joining with me in sending this music forward!! Let's do this!</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/347189/files/20140203162417-jonathan_rowden_group_web-6.jpg?1391473457"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">About This Project</span><br/></p><p></p><p>The past year or so has been totally transformative for me - not only in music, but in life. </p><p>At it's roots, this project is reflective of my personal desire for a more natural way of living - of walking life in a way that <i>balances</i> our individuality with our need for community, and musically speaking, the nature of form and freedom. Stylistically the music on this album represents a summation of the sounds we love and the experiences we've had in many different types of music. </p><p>I’m joined by three of the most creative, gifted, and adventurous musicians that I know. </p><p><b>James Yoshizawa</b> - an incredibly gifted and imaginative drummer and percussionist. A distinctive drumset voice, and expert at many instruments from around the globe including Japanese taiko drum, Irish bones, bodhran, and pandeiro. Endless ability to orchestrate, adapt, and assert. </p><p><b>Ryan Pryor</b> - a virtuosic pianist, incredible composer (who contributed about half of the material for this project), and mad musical scientist. Endless capacity for conversation. The musical connection between us was huge in deciding to form this project.</p><p><b>Chris Hon</b> - a bassist with huge ears, ridiculous facility, and the ability to connect instantly with complex rhythmic and harmonic ideas. Endless imagination. </p><p>The driving themes behind this project are things that we appreciate about our favorite musicians: honesty and trust. In it’s essence, we are trying to take an honest approach to this music through natural sounding melodies and organic, cohesive group improvisations. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered that this takes a great deal of trust and vulnerable communication — but the result is music that is from the heart, that constantly surprises us, and is always evolving into something new. You might hear elements from a number of different musical styles coming through, so we'll let the listener decide where we are coming from, but what I can say is that the music in this project will be rhythmically deep, melodically satisfying, and improvisationally  adventurous, subtle, and full of textures and colors that are true to the moment. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What You Can Give &amp; What You Will Get</h3><p>Your participation DIRECTLY influences the creation and sustainability of this record. Money that goes in will go directly to costs associated with production, pressing, and promotion, and any money left over will go towards the bands Spring Tour through Seattle/Portland and the greater northwest in May 2014. All efforts go to extend the life of this creative work, and invest in the future of our band's reach.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If for some reason we don't reach the entire goal, the funds that are raised go directly to the project and costs associated with it. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The general breakdown is as follows:</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Production: $3,000 - We are recording on February 19th at the legendary SUNSET SOUND in HOLLYWOOD, CA!!! Some of our (and maybe your) favorite bands have laid it down deep in here including Led Zepplin, The Doors, and more recently, one of my favorite bands ever, Kneebody!

A year ago in January 2013, I formed this quartet with the express intent of creating music that was both structured and free, and that was not relegated to any specific genre (though within the greater jazz idiom), but that reflected the aesthetic tastes of each member in the group. Since the band's debut show at Vitellos Upstairs in Studio City, CA  we have been refining the ""group sound"", writing new music, and honing our ability to connect spontaneously in performance. We've now found ourselves in an exciting place - the moment when the harvest is ripe for an album to be made that reflects the direction, ethos, and path of the group!We think that, together, we've found something worth sharing, and hope that you'll consider joining with me in sending this music forward!! Let's do this!About This ProjectThe past year or so has been totally transformative for me - not only in music, but in life. At it's roots, this project is reflective of my personal desire for a more natural way of living - of walking life in a way that balances our individuality with our need for community, and musically speaking, the nature of form and freedom. Stylistically the music on this album represents a summation of the sounds we love and the experiences we've had in many different types of music. I’m joined by three of the most creative, gifted, and adventurous musicians that I know. James Yoshizawa - an incredibly gifted and imaginative drummer and percussionist. A distinctive drumset voice, and expert at many instruments from around the globe including Japanese taiko drum, Irish bones, bodhran, and pandeiro. Endless ability to orchestrate, adapt, and assert. Ryan Pryor - a virtuosic pianist, incredible composer (who contributed about half of the material for this project), and mad musical scientist. Endless capacity for conversation. The musical connection between us was huge in deciding to form this project.Chris Hon - a bassist with huge ears, ridiculous facility, and the ability to connect instantly with complex rhythmic and harmonic ideas. Endless imagination. The driving themes behind this project are things that we appreciate about our favorite musicians: honesty and trust. In it’s essence, we are trying to take an honest approach to this music through natural sounding melodies and organic, cohesive group improvisations. Throughout this process, we’ve discovered that this takes a great deal of trust and vulnerable communication — but the result is music that is from the heart, that constantly surprises us, and is always evolving into something new. You might hear elements from a number of different musical styles coming through, so we'll let the listener decide where we are coming from, but what I can say is that the music in this project will be rhythmically deep, melodically satisfying, and improvisationally  adventurous, subtle, and full of textures and colors that are true to the moment. What You Can Give & What You Will GetYour participation DIRECTLY influences the creation and sustainability of this record. Money that goes in will go directly to costs associated with production, pressing, and promotion, and any money left over will go towards the bands Spring Tour through Seattle/Portland and the greater northwest in May 2014. All efforts go to extend the life of this creative work, and invest in the future of our band's reach.If for some reason we don't reach the entire goal, the funds that are raised go directly to the project and costs associated with it. The general breakdown is as follows:Production: $3,000 - We are recording on February 19th at the legendary SUNSET SOUND in HOLLYWOOD, CA!!! Some of our (and maybe your) favorite bands have laid it down deep in here including Led Zepplin, The Doors, and more recently, one of my favorite bands ever, Kneebody! Needless to say, we hope some of these vibes rub off on us as we get to it! Other production costs include mixing and mastering, piano tuning, and other essential things.Promotion: $1,000 (includes creation of promotional material, internet-based advertising, videos and EPK, and advertising costs associated with touring)Pressing: $1500 (includes the pressing of Limited Edition Vinyls and CDs, as well as bonus track singles/extras) No money here - how can I help?You can help immensely by spreading the word.

<p>My name is <b>Roland Graham</b>. I’m a classically trained pianist and music

Canada. </p>
<p>In collaboration with host venue - Southminster United Church - I present
emerging and established <b>classical</b>, <b>jazz</b> and alternative artists through freewill
offering funded concerts on a weekly basis. Additionally, I created and run the Master Piano
Recital Series, now starting its third season, as a
platform to showcase and provide <b>professional exposure</b> for superb <b>young pianists</b> from Canada and
abroad.<br/></p>
<p>With this campaign, I’m raising funds to <b>professionally restore</b> the
magnificent <b>110-year</b> old 9-foot <b>Heintzman grand piano</b> that makes these amazing initiatives possible. Far from being just any old instrument, the piano we care for is a <b>precious piece of Canadian history</b>. Once serving the world’s
elite pianists at Toronto’s legendary Massey Hall, it is said to have been
played by the likes of <b>Rachmaninoff</b> and <b>Gershwin</b>, among many others. <br/></p>

<b>future generations of pianists</b> - and collaborative ensembles, singers and
choirs - as the primary performance piano on the Southminster stage in Old Ottawa South.<br/></p>
<p>The cost of <b>twenty thousand dollars</b> is a small price to pay to preserve an important piece
of Canadian musical history, and to sustain the worthy cultural
initiatives that depend on it today.</p><p>
</p><p><b>Why
is this needed?</b></p>
<p>Many important components of the piano are pretty much worn out. Just like the timing belt in a car or liner in a backyard
pool, the functionality of a musical instrument depends on the integrity of its <b>key structural components</b>. As long as these are in good shape, or replaced when
they’re not, there’s no reason a <b>piano </b>can’t <b>last</b> <b>indefinitely</b>, just like many of the world’s finest violins, which can be hundreds of years old.</p>
<p>In fact, pianos rely on many of the <b>same principles</b> as
<b>violins </b>to work. Strings,
positioned to travel over a slightly raised piece of wood called a <b>bridge</b>, are
tightened, creating downward pressure onto a <b>sounding board</b> below. When the
strings are struck by hammers, their<b> vibrations</b> travel through the bridge and are
distributed across the sounding board, which <b>resonates</b>, amplifying and
<b>projecting the sound</b>.
</p>
<p>As with any physical process, the quality of the results depends upon the<b> integrity of the components</b>, and how well they are set up in relation to
one another. With age, <b>wood </b>naturally dries, shrinks, and <b>becomes brittle</b>. In a piano, the sounding board develops fissures and sags over time, weakening its power and other sound qualities. Another vital component, the <b>pin block</b>, eventually looses its grip on the 250-odd tuning pins, which must work together to hold the piano in tune.<br/></p><p><b>I've always thought the piano sounded fine...</b></p><p>It sounds terrific, and plays great too! That's because it's fundamentally a superb instrument, well built, and the beneficiary of a century's expert care. But it will start to noticeably deteriorate in the coming years - possibly months - under the demand of constant use it currently sustains. This job is somewhat pre-emptive; we don't want to wait until the piano has completely fallen apart.<br/></p><p><b>A pretty big job!</b><br/></p><p>A <b>comprehensive rebuild</b> - and that's what we aim to give the Heintzman - involves replacing all of these important components with brand new custom made parts: the <b>sounding board</b>, <b>bridges</b>, <b>pin block</b>, <b>strings</b> and <b>hammers</b>. During this process, anything else required, such as strengthening the frame and straightening any warped parts, will also be done. <br/></p><p>The result will essentially be a new piano, in terms of its structural integrity, refreshed artistic potential, and associated lifespan. And it will retain all the wonderful qualities it currently has, which a new piano, unless of extremely superior quality, would not be able to match.</p><p>The work will be done by top industry experts, highly specialized and experienced technicians who custom build piano components for the best instruments in the world. Some of it will be done in <b>Quebec</b>; some of it here in <b>Ottawa</b>.</p><p><b>So how exactly does this job break down?</b></p><p>Briefly, here are the costs of each part of the job. These are verifiable, industry standard estimates, rounded slightly for simplicity. <br/></p><ul>
<li>
<b>$10,000</b> - Installation of a brand new, custom-built <b>sounding board</b>, with supporting ribs and new <b>bridges</b>.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$2,500</b> - Installation of a brand new, custom-built <b>pin block</b>, precision drilled to accommodate 250 tuning pins.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$2,500</b> - Restringing with brand new custom-scaled top quality piano strings</li>
<li>
<b>$2,500</b> - Installation of new top-grade, German-made felt piano hammers</li>
<li>
<b>$2,500</b> - Taxes (approximate)<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p><b>All or nothing!</b></p><p>Since it is by far most efficient to do the entire job in one shot, this campaign is an all-or-nothing 
endeavour; if sufficient support cannot be found in time to proceed, no 
money will be collected or spent. And we won't be spending any money 
where it isn't needed either; the piano will not be refinished, and its 
superb Renner keyboard action, apart from a thorough tune up, will not be modified on in any way.</p><p><b>Don't be shy - just ask us!</b><br/></p><p>Questions about any aspect of this process will be enthusiastically answered to the best of our ability at any time during the campaign and beyond.</p><p><b>Thank you!</b></p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>
</p><p>Je m’appelle
<b>Roland Graham</b>.<span>  Je suis pianiste de formation
classique et présentateur de musique dans le cadre d’une série de concerts
originale et auto-suffisante que je produis à Ottawa, Canada.</span></p>
<p>En collaboration
avec l’Église unie Southminster où se donnent ces concerts entièrement financés
par les offrandes volontaires de l’auditoire, je présente chaque semaine des
artistes en musique <b>classique</b>, <b>jazz</b> ou alternative, qu’ils soient tout nouveaux
ou de réputation déjà bien établie. De plus, j’ai
fondé et je gère la Série magistrale de récitals de piano, qui entreprend sa
troisième saison. Elle met en valeur d’excellents <b>jeunes pianistes</b> du Canada et
d’ailleurs et leur offre une occasion sans pareil de se produire sur scène et
de démontrer leurs talents supérieurs au clavier.

</p><p>Le but de cette
campagne de collecte de fonds est de faire remettre à neuf par des
professionnels le magnifique piano à queue <b>Heintzman de 9 pieds</b> maintenant âgé
de 110 ans, qui permet de réaliser ces importantes initiatives. Il n’est pas
qu’un vieil instrument, ce piano est une <b>précieuse pièce de l’histoire
canadienne</b>.<span>  Il a servi au légendaire
Massey Hall de Toronto à des pianistes d’élite tels que, dit-on, <b>Rachmaninov</b>,
Peterson, Gershwin parmi tant d’autres.</span>
</p><p>Bien que le piano
ait encore une belle sonorité – on l’emploie au moins une et parfois deux fois
par semaine pour des <b>concerts professionnels</b> l’année durant – par le fait même
de son âge il a atteint le bout du cycle de remplacement de pièces et a un
besoin pressant de réparations si on veut le conserver encore longtemps.</p>
<p>Cette remise en
état lui redonnera sa <b>splendeur d’autrefois</b> et servira à de nombreuses
générations de pianistes, ensembles musicaux, chanteurs, chorales, sur la scène
de Southminster.</p>
<p>Le coût de <b>20,000
$</b> semble très peu à payer pour préserver une splendide pièce de l’histoire
musicale canadienne et pour assurer la continuité des initiatives culturelles
qui en dépendent.</p>
<p><b>Est-ce nécessaire ?</b></p>
<p>Plusieurs
éléments du piano ont subi l’usure du temps et de l’âge.<span>  Tout comme pour la courroie de distribution
d’une voiture ou la toile d’une piscine, le bon fonctionnement d’un instrument
dépend de l’intégrité de ses composantes structurales.  Tant et aussi longtemps que celles d’un piano
sont en bon état, ou si on les remplace quand elles ne le sont plus, rien n’empêche
qu’il dure indéfiniment : certains violons de grande valeur ont des
centaines d’années d’existence.</span></p>
<p>À l’instar des violons, les pianos
fonctionnent selon les mêmes principes que ceux-là. Les cordes
disposées sur une pièce de bois surélevée et appelée chevalet se tendent et
créent une pression vers le bas en direction de la table d’harmonie.<span>  Lorsque les marteaux frappent ces cordes, leurs
vibrations sont transmises par le chevalet et distribuées tout au long de la
table d’harmonie ce qui produit, amplifie et renvoie le son musical.</span>
</p><p>Tout cela est de
la physique, et dans tout processus de physique la qualité de la solution dépend
de l’intégrité de ses composantes et de la relation qu’elles ont entre
elles.<span>  Avec l’âge, le bois sèche,
rétrécit et devient friable.  Dans un
piano, la table d’harmonie développe des fissures et s’affaisse, ce qui
affaiblit sa puissance et autres
qualités sonores.  Un autre élément
essentiel, le sommier de cheville, éventuellement relâche son emprise sur les
chevilles d’accord réduisant ainsi la capacité de retenir la justesse de
l’accord.</span></p>
<p><b>Je croyais que le piano avait un bon son…</b></p>
<p>Il a en effet un
son remarquable et c’est un plaisir de le jouer !<span>  Et cela vient du fait que c‘est
fondamentalement un superbe instrument, d’excellente facture, et l’objet d’un
siècle de soins experts assidus.  Mais il
va se détériorer sensiblement d’ici quelques années – voire même quelques mois
– étant donné son usage constant. Ce
sera un travail préventif car il ne faut pas attendre la détérioration
complète.</span></p>
<p><b>Un vrai gros travail !</b></p>
<p>Le but est de faire
une <b>réfection complète</b> du Heintzman et remplacer les pièces importantes par des
pièces flambant neuves fabriquées sur mesure : la <b>table d’harmonie</b>, les<b>
chevalets</b>, le <b>sommier de cheville</b>, les <b>cordes </b>et les <b>marteaux</b>.<span>  Au cours de ces travaux on pourrait devoir
renforcer la charpente ou redresser le gauchissement de certaines pièces et ce
sera fait.</span></p>
<p>En terme
d’intégrité de structure et de durée de vie, il sera comme neuf, son potentiel
artistique accru, mais il conservera toutes ses qualités extraordinaires, ce
qu’un nouveau piano, à moins d’être
d’une qualité exceptionnelle, ne pourrait égaler.</p>
<p>Les travaux
seront exécutés par des experts en la matière, des techniciens hautement spécialisés
et expérimentés qui fabriquent sur commande des composantes de pianos pour les
meilleurs instruments au monde. Ils seront faits partie au Québec, partie à
Ottawa.</p>
<p><b>Ventilation des coûts</b></p>
<p>En bref, voici le
coût associé à chaque partie du travail.<span> 
Ce sont des chiffres courants et normaux de l’industrie, facilement
vérifiables, arrondis ici quelque peu :</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>10 000 $</b> - Installation d’une <b>table
d’harmonie</b> neuve, fabriquée sur mesure, renforcée par des côtes en bois, ou
<b>barres d’harmonie</b>, et des chevalets neufs ;</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>2
500 $</b> - Installation d’un <b>sommier de cheville</b> neuf, fait sur mesure, et prêt à
recevoir avec précision 250 chevilles d’accord ou pointes d’accroche ;<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>2
500 $</b> - Installation de <b>nouvelles cordes</b> de première qualité ;<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>2
500 $</b> - Installation de nouveaux <b>marteaux</b> de facture allemande de première
qualité ;</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>2
500 $</b> - Taxes (approximativement)</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>C’est tout ou rien !</b></p>
<p>Sachant qu’il est
de beaucoup plus efficace d’effectuer un plan d’envergure<span>  d’un seul trait, ce projet de financement revient
à tout ou à rien – si on ne trouve pas l’appui nécessaire et ponctuel, aucune
somme ne sera collectée ou dépensée. Nous ne dépenserons pas d’argent
inutilement.  La finition extérieure du
piano ne sera pas refaite, et à part une régulation à fond,  on ne touchera d’aucune façon à son action
Renner.</span></p>
<p><b>N’hésitez pas – Posez vos questions !</b></p>
<p>Nous répondrons

</div>","My name is Roland Graham. I’m a classically trained pianist and music
presenter who runs an original, self-sustaining concert series in Ottawa,
Canada. 
In collaboration with host venue - Southminster United Church - I present
emerging and established classical, jazz and alternative artists through freewill
offering funded concerts on a weekly basis. Additionally, I created and run the Master Piano
Recital Series, now starting its third season, as a
platform to showcase and provide professional exposure for superb young pianists from Canada and
abroad.
With this campaign, I’m raising funds to professionally restore the
magnificent 110-year old 9-foot Heintzman grand piano that makes these amazing initiatives possible. Far from being just any old instrument, the piano we care for is a precious piece of Canadian history. Once serving the world’s
elite pianists at Toronto’s legendary Massey Hall, it is said to have been
played by the likes of Rachmaninoff and Gershwin, among many others. 
While the piano still plays and sounds great (it is used at least once, sometimes twice a week for professional concerts throughout the year), being entirely original, it has reached the end of its wear cycle and is in dire need of important structural repair if it is to last much longer.Restoring this piano to its original glory will permit it to serve many
future generations of pianists - and collaborative ensembles, singers and
choirs - as the primary performance piano on the Southminster stage in Old Ottawa South.
The cost of twenty thousand dollars is a small price to pay to preserve an important piece
of Canadian musical history, and to sustain the worthy cultural
initiatives that depend on it today.
Why
is this needed?
Many important components of the piano are pretty much worn out. Just like the timing belt in a car or liner in a backyard
pool, the functionality of a musical instrument depends on the integrity of its key structural components. As long as these are in good shape, or replaced when
they’re not, there’s no reason a piano can’t last indefinitely, just like many of the world’s finest violins, which can be hundreds of years old.
In fact, pianos rely on many of the same principles as
violins to work. Strings,
positioned to travel over a slightly raised piece of wood called a bridge, are
tightened, creating downward pressure onto a sounding board below. When the
strings are struck by hammers, their vibrations travel through the bridge and are
distributed across the sounding board, which resonates, amplifying and
projecting the sound.

As with any physical process, the quality of the results depends upon the integrity of the components, and how well they are set up in relation to
one another. With age, wood naturally dries, shrinks, and becomes brittle. In a piano, the sounding board develops fissures and sags over time, weakening its power and other sound qualities. Another vital component, the pin block, eventually looses its grip on the 250-odd tuning pins, which must work together to hold the piano in tune.I've always thought the piano sounded fine...It sounds terrific, and plays great too! That's because it's fundamentally a superb instrument, well built, and the beneficiary of a century's expert care. But it will start to noticeably deteriorate in the coming years - possibly months - under the demand of constant use it currently sustains. This job is somewhat pre-emptive; we don't want to wait until the piano has completely fallen apart.A pretty big job!A comprehensive rebuild - and that's what we aim to give the Heintzman - involves replacing all of these important components with brand new custom made parts: the sounding board, bridges, pin block, strings and hammers. During this process, anything else required, such as strengthening the frame and straightening any warped parts, will also be done. The result will essentially be a new piano, in terms of its structural integrity, refreshed artistic potential, and associated lifespan. And it will retain all the wonderful qualities it currently has, which a new piano, unless of extremely superior quality, would not be able to match.The work will be done by top industry experts, highly specialized and experienced technicians who custom build piano components for the best instruments in the world. Some of it will be done in Quebec; some of it here in Ottawa.So how exactly does this job break down?Briefly, here are the costs of each part of the job. These are verifiable, industry standard estimates, rounded slightly for simplicity. 

$10,000 - Installation of a brand new, custom-built sounding board, with supporting ribs and new bridges.


$2,500 - Installation of a brand new, custom-built pin block, precision drilled to accommodate 250 tuning pins.


$2,500 - Restringing with brand new custom-scaled top quality piano strings

$2,500 - Installation of new top-grade, German-made felt piano hammers

$2,500 - Taxes (approximate)

All or nothing!Since it is by far most efficient to do the entire job in one shot, this campaign is an all-or-nothing 
endeavour; if sufficient support cannot be found in time to proceed, no 
money will be collected or spent. And we won't be spending any money 
where it isn't needed either; the piano will not be refinished, and its 
superb Renner keyboard action, apart from a thorough tune up, will not be modified on in any way.Don't be shy - just ask us!Questions about any aspect of this process will be enthusiastically answered to the best of our ability at any time during the campaign and beyond.Thank you!--------------------------------------------------
Je m’appelle
Roland Graham.  Je suis pianiste de formation
classique et présentateur de musique dans le cadre d’une série de concerts
originale et auto-suffisante que je produis à Ottawa, Canada.
En collaboration
avec l’Église unie Southminster où se donnent ces concerts entièrement financés
par les offrandes volontaires de l’auditoire, je présente chaque semaine des
artistes en musique classique, jazz ou alternative, qu’ils soient tout nouveaux
ou de réputation déjà bien établie. De plus, j’ai
fondé et je gère la Série magistrale de récitals de piano, qui entreprend sa
troisième saison. Elle met en valeur d’excellents jeunes pianistes du Canada et
d’ailleurs et leur offre une occasion sans pareil de se produire sur scène et
de démontrer leurs talents supérieurs au clavier.

Le but de cette
campagne de collecte de fonds est de faire remettre à neuf par des
professionnels le magnifique piano à queue Heintzman de 9 pieds maintenant âgé
de 110 ans, qui permet de réaliser ces importantes initiatives. Il n’est pas
qu’un vieil instrument, ce piano est une précieuse pièce de l’histoire
canadienne.  Il a servi au légendaire
Massey Hall de Toronto à des pianistes d’élite tels que, dit-on, Rachmaninov,
Peterson, Gershwin parmi tant d’autres.
Bien que le piano
ait encore une belle sonorité – on l’emploie au moins une et parfois deux fois
par semaine pour des concerts professionnels l’année durant – par le fait même
de son âge il a atteint le bout du cycle de remplacement de pièces et a un
besoin pressant de réparations si on veut le conserver encore longtemps.
Cette remise en
état lui redonnera sa splendeur d’autrefois et servira à de nombreuses
générations de pianistes, ensembles musicaux, chanteurs, chorales, sur la scène
de Southminster.
Le coût de 20,000
$ semble très peu à payer pour préserver une splendide pièce de l’histoire
musicale canadienne et pour assurer la continuité des initiatives culturelles
qui en dépendent.
Est-ce nécessaire ?
Plusieurs
éléments du piano ont subi l’usure du temps et de l’âge.  Tout comme pour la courroie de distribution
d’une voiture ou la toile d’une piscine, le bon fonctionnement d’un instrument
dépend de l’intégrité de ses composantes structurales.  Tant et aussi longtemps que celles d’un piano
sont en bon état, ou si on les remplace quand elles ne le sont plus, rien n’empêche
qu’il dure indéfiniment : certains violons de grande valeur ont des
centaines d’années d’existence.
À l’instar des violons, les pianos
fonctionnent selon les mêmes principes que ceux-là. Les cordes
disposées sur une pièce de bois surélevée et appelée chevalet se tendent et
créent une pression vers le bas en direction de la table d’harmonie.  Lorsque les marteaux frappent ces cordes, leurs
vibrations sont transmises par le chevalet et distribuées tout au long de la
table d’harmonie ce qui produit, amplifie et renvoie le son musical.
Tout cela est de
la physique, et dans tout processus de physique la qualité de la solution dépend
de l’intégrité de ses composantes et de la relation qu’elles ont entre
elles.  Avec l’âge, le bois sèche,
rétrécit et devient friable.  Dans un
piano, la table d’harmonie développe des fissures et s’affaisse, ce qui
affaiblit sa puissance et autres
qualités sonores.  Un autre élément
essentiel, le sommier de cheville, éventuellement relâche son emprise sur les
chevilles d’accord réduisant ainsi la capacité de retenir la justesse de
l’accord.
Je croyais que le piano avait un bon son…
Il a en effet un
son remarquable et c’est un plaisir de le jouer !  Et cela vient du fait que c‘est
fondamentalement un superbe instrument, d’excellente facture, et l’objet d’un
siècle de soins experts assidus.  Mais il
va se détériorer sensiblement d’ici quelques années – voire même quelques mois
– étant donné son usage constant. Ce
sera un travail préventif car il ne faut pas attendre la détérioration
complète.
Un vrai gros travail !
Le but est de faire
une réfection complète du Heintzman et remplacer les pièces importantes par des
pièces flambant neuves fabriquées sur mesure : la table d’harmonie, les
chevalets, le sommier de cheville, les cordes et les marteaux.  Au cours de ces travaux on pourrait devoir
renforcer la charpente ou redresser le gauchissement de certaines pièces et ce
sera fait.
En terme
d’intégrité de structure et de durée de vie, il sera comme neuf, son potentiel
artistique accru, mais il conservera toutes ses qualités extraordinaires, ce
qu’un nouveau piano, à moins d’être
d’une qualité exceptionnelle, ne pourrait égaler.
Les travaux
seront exécutés par des experts en la matière, des techniciens hautement spécialisés
et expérimentés qui fabriquent sur commande des composantes de pianos pour les
meilleurs instruments au monde. Ils seront faits partie au Québec, partie à
Ottawa.
Ventilation des coûts
En bref, voici le
coût associé à chaque partie du travail. 
Ce sont des chiffres courants et normaux de l’industrie, facilement
vérifiables, arrondis ici quelque peu :


10 000 $ - Installation d’une table
d’harmonie neuve, fabriquée sur mesure, renforcée par des côtes en bois, ou
barres d’harmonie, et des chevalets neufs ;

2
500 $ - Installation d’un sommier de cheville neuf, fait sur mesure, et prêt à
recevoir avec précision 250 chevilles d’accord ou pointes d’accroche ;


2
500 $ - Installation de nouvelles cordes de première qualité ;


2
500 $ - Installation de nouveaux marteaux de facture allemande de première
qualité ;

2
500 $ - Taxes (approximativement)



C’est tout ou rien !
Sachant qu’il est
de beaucoup plus efficace d’effectuer un plan d’envergure  d’un seul trait, ce projet de financement revient
à tout ou à rien – si on ne trouve pas l’appui nécessaire et ponctuel, aucune
somme ne sera collectée ou dépensée. Nous ne dépenserons pas d’argent
inutilement.  La finition extérieure du
piano ne sera pas refaite, et à part une régulation à fond,  on ne touchera d’aucune façon à son action
Renner.
N’hésitez pas – Posez vos questions !
Nous répondrons
avec enthousiasme à toutes les questions relatives à quelque aspect que ce soit
de ce projet au meilleur de notre connaissance en tout point durant cette
campagne et même au-delà.
