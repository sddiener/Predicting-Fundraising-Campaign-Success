<h3>THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN MUSIC<br/>
</h3>Fires are started by a reaction between oxygen and a fuel of some sort 
but, for the reaction to occur, the fuel must be heated.  As a musician I've worked relentlessly to provide the world with great music.  As a servant, I've committed to providing the world with the hope we're told is lost.  My music has been heard in movies directed by the likes of Malcolm Lee (Director of Best Man 2), Joshua Butler (Director of Enemy of The State), Karyn Kusama (Director of Aeon Flux), and more.  I've been seen internationally on shows like WWE (wrestling), The Family Feud, Let's Ask America, Right This Minute, TBN's ""Praise The Lord,"" JCTV's ""Exit 16,"" TCT's ""I'm Just Sayin"" and more.  I am also a licensed minister, husband, and father of four extraodinary children.  Additionally, I've been featured in magazines and radio throughout the world.  I mention all of this to you not as a boast on my achievements but as examples of my dedication to my God given gift.  The hopeless are the fuel, you/we are the oxygen, and the heat is within our ability to inspire through our actions.  Let's make PYRO!<br/><br/>Even with all of the aforementioned accolades, I pride most an award I received from my peers and city officials in 2009, ""Cleveland's Finest Dad/Leader of the year.""  I am passionate about this album and mission because, for the past two and a half years, I have journeyed the trenches of prisons, schools, rehabilitation facilities and streets to see first hand the impact that ministry through music and service with compassion has had on thousands of lives.  My wife and I have been able to cover some ground on our own and have volunteered our time and finances to get this far.  I am confident that, with your help, we can take this mission much further.  Though I vow to give you some of the greatest music you've ever heard, your contribution will be more than just funding an album; it will be investing into our communities and future.  We want to get this into those whose hands, hearts and lives need it FOR FREE.  On completion, we will be walking neighborhoods and placing hard copies directly into the hands that need to hear this uplifting sound most.  The places our feet are unable to reach, we will digitally distribute free of charge. <br/><p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This is just phase 1 (bare bones ground level for launch).  Your contributions will go toward mastering, printing, digitally distributing, and initial marketing.  I hope it's not the case but, if the goal is not reached, all funds raised will simply go toward mastering and printing. (but I'm sure you all won't leave us there)  What's great about this campaign is the amazing perks.  There aren't many investments that gives you an immediate return that's priceless.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>I've done tons of research, kept my ears to the 
ground, and watched other people use this method and actually succeed. There
 have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to 
understand this format, but it's missing something.  Rarely do you have an opportunity to see how bands and artists utilize the funds.</p>
<p>We however, will make ourselves accountable to you to show you how every
 penny is spent and prove that making a top notch record, and being the change we want to see in society, comes at a 
price.  Besides, you are our partner.  Who knows, if we exceed our goal, we will be able to do some of the things we have only dreamed about.  The success of this campaign 
will determine how amazing this record will become.  We are set up for 
Flex Funding, which means if we don't reach our goal, we are still 
getting the money that is raised.  So, if we don't reach our goal, we 
will have to reevaluate our plan to complete the vision of the album but we are ready to deliver this thing however our campaign 
plays out.</p>

the perks is exclusive to the campaign.   The exclusive listings are all one time offers. <br/></strong></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>     
<span>My wife and I have had the privilege of serving with Teen Challenge in two of its
locations in Pennsylvania. 
If you are unfamiliar with them, Teen
Challenge offers: <i>“Christ-entered,
faith-based solutions for youth, adults, and families, struggling with
life-controlling problems, such as addiction.”</i>  Additionally, we’ve
been diligently serving as volunteers for the Richland Correctional Institution
in Mansfield, Ohio for the past three years and the Youth Department of Corrections for the last year.  Additionally, we have served in public schools for the past few years with campaigns like ""The Make a Difference Movement: Anti-Bullying and Violence."" While many of you may know me as a
musician and my many other gifts, my heart is
to be a master of service.  What I love
about service is that there is no set number in who can be involved and, through
it, God extends an invitation to us all.</span>
<p><span>     There are currently about 2 million men and
women that are incarcerated.  Here are
some alarming numbers, (and this blew my mind) there are more jails than
colleges right now in the United
  States. 
There are even some counties in the state of New York where 30% of the population is made
up of inmates. (<a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/06/the-u-s-has-more-jails-than-colleges-heres-a-map-of-where-those-prisoners-live/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/06/the-u-s-has-more-jails-than-colleges-heres-a-map-of-where-those-prisoners-live/</a>)</span></p>
<p>     Other
countries don’t have less crime than the U.S. but our sentences are a lot
longer, especially for property and drug crimes.<span>  Compared to England,
a sentence here in the U.S.
for burglary is about 3 times longer for the exact same crime.  This is no endorsement or condoning of crime but rather a call to reduce the occurrence of these offenses by supplying an alternative mentality and encouraging appropriate justice where these crimes are committed. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>     Out of the
total 2.3 million of those incarcerated, African Americans account for 1 million
of them and African Americans are incarcerated at about six times the rate of
Caucasians. (<a href=""http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet</a>)
“There are more African American men in
correctional control now than were enslaved in 1850” (<a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8088989/john-legend-oscars-speech-quote"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vox.com/2015/2/23/8088989/john-legend-oscars-speech-quote</a>
) and if this is not corrected now, 1 in
3 African American males born can expect to spend time in prison at some
point in his life! (<a href=""http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet</a>)  <span></span>Surely this is NOT about race but, because I am an African
American male and have three sons of my own, I feel compelled to change this in
every community and you should too!<span>  <br/></span></p>
<p><span>     On
<span>May 5, 2015</span> I will be releasing my 5<sup>th</sup> musical project entitled:
“Pyro.”  It will be a “FREE” downloadable
mix tape that will take Christ’s hope, love, and salvation into to the world in an unadulterated way.  People need God’s love and hope and it’s time
for those of us who are willing to take it to them!  I plan to take it out into every hedge and highway, BELIEVING God will make this the most downloaded mix tape of
2015.  Will you believe and labor with
me to make this a reality?</span></p>
<p><span>     </span>Lastly, I feel obligated to let you know that when I first went to prisons voluntarily, I had no real expectation and many stereotypes about those
imprisoned; but then I met Al Cleveland.<span> 
Honestly, here I was being petitioned to go in and help
change lives but this brother changed mine. 
Al has already served 20 years in prison for a murder he didn't
commit.  I know, we hear inmates
proclaiming their innocence regularly but this is different.  I have sat in the courtroom firsthand and witnessed the Innocence Project fight to get him out.  I’ve seen the evidence, or lack
there of; no dna, no prints, no weapon, no videotape only a witness from a
crooked informant (William Avery) who was a heroine addict.  William Avery even came clean to many media
outlets and government officials saying the police paid him thousands to ID Cleveland and three other
men of the crime.  He also announced his
shame of lying and bearing false witness just to feed his addiction. Avery has come forth now because he claims to have turned his life around and wants to
do the right thing.  Regardless of this admission and evidence, Al Cleveland was denied release and remains incarcerated.  Yet, every time I see Al in the Bible studies
and worship services, he continues to lift the name of Christ and is one of the most humble individuals I've ever met.  Honestly, Cleveland's story is unique but just ONE example of millions.  T</span><span>here are many who are really guilty
of their crimes that need to experience salvation also.  I
think of how lost I used to be and all the mistakes I’ve made but, if it weren't for God’s
GRACE and MERCY, I wouldn't be here to tell about it! <b>I NEED YOU ON THIS. I need you to pray, sow, support,
market, and help me out.</b> The Kingdom
 of God is at hand. Who’s
with me?  </span></p>
<p><b><sup><span>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12 The Message (MSG)</span></sup></b></p>
<p><sup><span>9-10 </span></sup><span>It’s better to
have a partner than go it alone.</span><br/>
<span>Share the work, share the wealth.<br/>
And if one falls down, the other helps,<br/>
But if there’s no one to help, tough!</span></p>
<p><sup><span>11 </span></sup><span>Two in a bed warm each
other.</span><br/>
<span>Alone, you shiver all night.</span></p>
<p><sup><span>12 </span></sup><span>By yourself you’re
unprotected.</span><br/>
<span>With a friend you can face the worst.<br/>
Can you round up a third?<br/>
A three-stranded rope isn’t easily snapped</span>.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The risks and challenges before us are many but the reward is far greater.  A good friend once said to me ""it's not a sacrifice if it doesn't stretch you.""  Those words are what continues to keep me motivated in the face of adversity.  I can't guarantee that everything will work according to plan but I can assure you that I have studied, labored tirelessly, prayed, fasted, and committed fully to seeing this mission through to its completion.  We all reap the reward every time an inmate is released and calls me for continued guidance, a student shares their ability to cope with bullying and pushes through to success, a gang member testifies about breaking loose from a destructive lifestyle, and my family shows pride for the example I work to set before them.  <br/></p>

We play it because we love it and we know that you will too.We support local music because every national act was once a local act somewhere.Passion is our driving force leading us to make a difference not only in Columbus but in the national alternative music scene.Our heart and soul is music; we are dedicated to listeners and the community. Our DJs listen to your requests because unlike conglomerate  radio, we have the time for you. Conglomerate radio is dominating the U.S airways because it's profitable.  How is it so profitable you might ask?Efficiency of scale.Conglomerate stations don't have a DJ in every market, in fact, they may have only one reaching from L.A to Chicago.  Good luck requesting a song. There's no one there to take your call!How do conglomerates pick music? They pick music that is scientifically tested and true.  Music that makes $$$, music that is already a big hit.  Say goodbye to your favorite local tunes, up and comers and music discovery.What do you lose with all that efficiency?You lose personality.  You lose connection to the community.  You lose opportunities for musicians.  You  lose your voice.Through our non-profit, CD102.5 For The Kids, we have donated more than one million dollars to children's charities over the past 25 years.We believe that radio is more than charts and stats, it's a community.Our intern program helps many young adults learn essential skills and make invaluable contacts, helping them land careers both in and out of the music industry. Hell, half of our staff were interns once.What began as a rag tag bunch of kids with a passion for music and a desire to make a difference has become a vital force in the music industry. We just have a few more wrinkles and some incredible stories.  WHY WE NEED $$$When the radio station began it was at the frequency of 101.1 FM. Five years ago, the original owner sold the frequency and tower. This left us with quite a challenge. With no frequency, there was no radio station. With the knowledge that 101.1 FM was making a difference, its employees were not willing to give up. Taking the reins in 2010, long time employee Randy Malloy bought the intellectual property of 101.1 (CD101) and began renting the signal at 102.5 FM. For nearly 25 years, we have been a self-sufficient, commercial station, wholly funded by advertisers. Unlike public radio (which we love and support) we have never held a fund-drive or asked for money for radio station operations. Until now.  In 18 months the lease for our broadcasting license is up. When CD102.5 began renting the license, we paid only $12,000 dollars per month.  Since then, the cost has increased dramatically (See Our Time Brokerage Agreement.)As a mom and pop radio station, for us to be truly independent, the purchase of the broadcasting license is needed.We are single, standalone; we are independent, individual, like you. We aren't a mega corporation, playing the same music across multiple frequencies.  CD102.5 does not have the resources or the backing of a large radio conglomerate. In order to make this necessary purchase for our long-term sustainability and continued independence, we need enough funding to acquire 102.5 FM. We cannot afford to put a down-payment on a multi-million dollar broadcasting license without your help.  PERKS

















Q&A""Are you going away?""No, we are not going to go away, we are trying to secure our independence.“Why Now?”In 18 months our lease is up. This is the time for negotiations of a new lease or purchase.""Why are you doing a crowdfunding campaign?""When we were at 101.1 FM we owned the tower and frequency. For five years now we have been renting at 102.5 FM. To be truly independent, we need to purchase the broadcasting license to ensure long term stability.""How long is the campaign?""The campaign is 60 days.Now through Thursday, September 3 at Noon EST.“How much are you trying to raise?”$1 Million Dollars is the goal with  stretch goals up to $5 Million Dollars.“What is a license?”The license is the permit issued by the FCC (federal communications commision) that allows broadcasters to use a specific part of the radio spectrum.“What is a frequency?”The frequency is the specific dial location on the radio spectrum that is allocated to a broadcaster in our case 1025MHz.“Can you rent a different license or frequency?”No, there are no comparable licences or frequencies in our area. Communities are only allowed a certain number of frequencies and therefore they are in limited supply.“How much does it cost to rent your tower and frequency?”$20,000 Per Month now. See our Time Brokerage Agreement.Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no ability to adjust your perk selection.

<p>Hey, Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm an indie folk singer/ songwriter/  fiddler with an amazing new CD project, <b>Six Feet Down.</b> The recording and mixing is almost DONE.  I need some believers to help me finish my CD and promote the music!<br/></p> <p>This is my <b>6th album and I promise you, it delivers</b>.  Rooted in my own story, the message of the project weaves through the deeper brokenness of our lives and gives a voice to subjects that music often dances around but never fully addresses.  The beauty of it is it's specific and illusive at the same time.  It calls you out if you've lied and cheated your way through life, yet it gives you a voice if you've never been heard.  This CD will give hope to those who are broken and strengthen all of us to move toward truth and wholeness.  <br/></p>
<p>These songs have already been proven out on the road with a resounding response! Now it's time to go public in a bigger way and get <b>Six Feet Down</b> out with your help.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we raise will pay for the CD cover and T-shirt design, photography, duplication and yes, a music video!  Any extra raised will be put toward promotion to ensure that the CD get's heard in as many markets as possible.  We are budgeting $6,000 but hope to blow through that goal with your support.<br/></p>
<p>We're offering some great incentives for you to get on board, some as
 simple as pre-ordering a CD, a download or a T-Shirt to holding a house 
concert for you and your friends, or a corporate event for your company!   <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Can you imagine hearing one of my songs on the radio and saying, ""I helped get that song there!"" More importantly, these songs will change lives.  From festivals, churches and wineries to prisons and shelters, people are saying, "" I feel like you're singing about my life... Thank you for giving me courage to keep up the fight.""  Songs on my last two CD's were featured in films and took awards in several categories, but I believe wholeheartedly that this is my best and most creative project to date. Help <b>Six Feet Down</b> hit the streets and make a difference!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges  <br/>
</h3> <p>My greatest fear in releasing this project is that people will think it's only for those who've been really traumatized or that they will be afraid it's too heavy.  But don't we buy ""break-up"" albums all the time?  I think we would all agree that some of the best songs have come from hard times.   This is also a very vulnerable project for me.  I've poured out musically and lyrically in an effort to capture some of the deeper and more difficult stories I've come across including my own.  But the more I hear, the more I realize how common these stories are.  And the more I play it out, the more affirmation I get...  So, I've chosen to <i>own this project fully with no apologies. </i><br/></p>
<p>I've also taken a bit of a musical departure from my last project which had more of a country feel.  This record uses similar instrumentation with a very Indie Folk sound.  Everyone who's heard it loves it!  I think my fans will fall in love with it too.<br/> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The simple act of pre-ordering the CD might get us to the 
goal, but there are other VERY IMPORTANT ways that you can help that 
don't cost a thing. Would you tell your friends about this campaign and make some noise about it? Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, whatever it takes, a campaign like this takes a team of folks to get the word out and create a buzz.   Indiegogo has share tools that makes this easy to do!<br/></p>
<p>Well, friends, that's it.  I know a lot of you know me and have come out to our shows and supported me and the Kate White Band in numerous ways.  If you can think back to a moment where something I sang or shared made a difference for you, then you know that sums up what my life and music are about.  Just know I will continue to sing my heart out and bring a message of hope wherever the road leads me.

Hey, Everyone,
I'm an indie folk singer/ songwriter/  fiddler with an amazing new CD project, Six Feet Down. The recording and mixing is almost DONE.  I need some believers to help me finish my CD and promote the music! This is my 6th album and I promise you, it delivers.  Rooted in my own story, the message of the project weaves through the deeper brokenness of our lives and gives a voice to subjects that music often dances around but never fully addresses.  The beauty of it is it's specific and illusive at the same time.  It calls you out if you've lied and cheated your way through life, yet it gives you a voice if you've never been heard.  This CD will give hope to those who are broken and strengthen all of us to move toward truth and wholeness.  
These songs have already been proven out on the road with a resounding response! Now it's time to go public in a bigger way and get Six Feet Down out with your help.

<p><b>Hey
Guys!</b></p>
<p>First off, I want to thank you for
clicking on my page, my name is Aleko and I am a singer-songwriter from New
Jersey. It wasn't until only recently that this project started, deciding it was about time to release these songs. I’ve compiled
my work together and I’m taking it into the studio, some of which I’ve already
recorded, for my debut EP with Matt Weber of the band <i>Young Statues</i>. </p>
<p>The title of the campaign “Help
Aleko Get to Nashville,” is only part of the big plan. After having
finished the EP I will have physical copies made to take them from New Jersey
to Tennessee, and time spent going there will be used to play shows and
distribute the merchandise. Going to Nashville is not the end goal, despite the
title of the campaign. As a whole I am looking to not only play shows in
Tennessee, but to collaborate with as many talented artists as I can. Doing
this will guarantee a diverse array of material and ensure that this momentum
is held forward.</p>
<p>I have been wanting to do this for a
long time now, and I’m taking every opportunity I can to push this forward. With
your help I can both accomplish this goal as well as keep the flow of material
going for both current and future fans alike. </p>
<p><b>Where
I need your help most!</b></p>
<p>Reaching this goal will allow me to
finish recording the EP, putting as much of effort and emotion that I can into
each song, and support hard copies of my debut EP; more merchandise could
follow should the goal be met, or even exceeded. This will give me comfort in
being able to spend time in Nashville to give this tour both a productive and
successful close, performing and collaborating with other artists. </p>
<p>By contributing you will receive a
set reward based on the amount you donated. From digital copies of the EP,
handwritten notes thanking each individual who’s shown support, to a signed
hard copy of the EP. Whether I reach my goal or not, these donations will be
put towards this project. Every donation helps, no matter how big or small, and
words cannot express how thankful I am for the support.  </p>
<p><b>Alternatives.</b></p>
<p>If you can’t contribute that is
fine, but there are other ways you can help. </p>
<p>Simply sharing this page with your friends,
family, and getting the word out about this project would benefit me as well. I
am dying to show you what I’ve been working on. </p>
<p>You can find me online primarily through Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube to keep up to date with the whole recording process. I want to keep this moving forward, and whether your help is through word, finances, or even both, you play a huge part in keeping this up. <br/></p>

<div>Hello there!</div>
<div> If you don't happen to be familiar with Rita Rose, she's a 1950s doll inspired from the two showgirls who provide comedic relief in White Christmas. The Rita Rose Show is summarized as a 1950s Comedy/Rockabilly show, in which Rita Rose sings covers of the fabulous ladies of Rockabilly as well as to original tunes written in a similar style. She's a charming gal that leaves her audiences smiling throughout the show with her adorable accent and comedic tendencies.</div>
<div>Since the show has progressed after its premiere in 2013, my dreams for The Rita Rose Show keep getting bigger and bigger. One of those dreams was to have a residency at a resort type venue as it's the perfect show for that particular audience. Guess what? That dream is coming true! Starting June 1st, 2015, I'll get to perform the show while on contract as an Entertainer at a resort. When I received the job offer, I immediately thought, ""Before I go, I HAVE to record an EP with my dear Chicago friends who have performed with me and helped shape the show!"" </div>
<div>Recording an EP (and eventually album) of my original tunes was also one of those big dreams. Not only would it be beneficial to have as a souvenir available for future audience members to able to remember the show, but also it would be sentimental as the incredibly talented musicians that I plan to record on the 5 Song EP with me have been there throughout the early shows and have been nothing but encouraging every step of the way.</div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Where will the funds go? </b></span></div>
</div><div> <ul> <li>Funding will go towards studio time, mastering the recordings, securing rehearsal spaces, musician payment, CD artwork, CD Printing, reward merchandise, postage to ship the rewards, and towards the costs of the Farewell Rita Rose Show on May 18.</li> <li>Rewards include a digital download, CD, tickets to the Farewell Rita Rose Show, tickets to future Rita Rose Shows, T-Shirts, Signed Posters, Personalized Video Messages, AND private performances of The Rita Rose Show! </li> <li>If the goal of $6,000 is not met, the funds will go towards the Farewell Rita Rose Show on May 18, and anything left over will go towards marketing The Rita Rose Show. </li>

<div>This campaign may seem last minute---and it is! When I received the job offer, I debated for a few days whether or not to launch a crowdfunding campaign due to the fact that we're extremely limited on time to rehearse, record, and get the CD mastered as schedules vary, and my departure from Chicago is just a few weeks away. Obviously, since you're reading this, I felt that it was now or never! </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Other Ways You Can Contribute</b></span></p>

BKWS values serious contemporary works of both established and emerging composers. All but one of the compositions on our WASBE program were written by living composers and several works are from composers under the age of 30.




The caliber of our musicianship is so exceptional, that BKWS ensemble members Jeffrey Hodes and Samantha K. Enriquez will be featured as soloists on two concertos including the West Coast premiere of David Maslanka's Clarinet Concerto.








BKWS makes it a point to share musical gains with our community. Many of the composers who we are featuring on this program have already shared their talents by working with our sister ensemble the Grand Street Community Band and with our biggest fans, the awesome music students at Grand Street Campus.

Amanda, a 34-year old mum of two, has been part of our team since 2012 and we were all taken aback when we heard the shocking news of her sudden illness.</p>
<p>We have all been thinking about Amanda and her family a lot over the past few months. As a team we like to think of ourselves as a family, and like any good family we wanted to show Amanda how much we miss her and wish her a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>So, when one of the team heard Boston's 'Amanda' on the radio on his drive to work one day a light-bulb moment happened.</p>
<p>The team already has a few budding musicians, as well as its fair share of show-offs, so the idea of putting together a band with a group of supporting performers to record a cover version of the song seemed a good one.</p>
<p> We hope that the song will put a smile on Amanda's face and let her know that we miss her. We also hope that we can use this as an opportunity to raise some funds the benefit both Amanda and her family and the Stroke Association, the UK's leading stroke charity.</p>

We all have a responsibility to live a healthy and fit lifestyle, but we also need invaluable research to be funded by charities like the Stroke Association to make sure that the risk of stroke is understood and minimised for all of us. We also need to support valuable networks of carers and volunteers who help those who have experienced a stroke to get back to a normal life.</p>

<h3><b>En route pour l'enfer</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hell Of A Ride c'est un éboulement sonore de gros riffs, de rythmiques lourdes, une explosion de moteur V8 chargé à la nitroglycérine, une virée d'enfer portée par un Heavy ""Stunt"" Rock aux accents de Metal, au parfum de Southern Rock et aux racines de Hard Rock. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Non seulement le groupe s'offre un arsenal auditif puissant et rôdé, mais il s'appuie sur un univers visuel fort, inspiré d'un cinéma galvanisé au Rock'N'Roll. Il suffit d'écouter les titres de leur EP <b>""Fast As Lightning""</b> (produit par Charles ""Kallaghan"" Massabo) pour être transporté dans cet univers bercé par la soif de vivre, la revanche, la nostalgie et l'adrénaline. </p>
<span><p>C'est sur cette trame que Hell Of A Ride s'est bâtit une réputation scénique fulgurante, amenant le groupe à jouer en <b>première partie de Black Stone Cherry (USA) dans une Maroquinerie pleine à craquer</b> avec un public réactif dès les premières notes du Show. Enchaînant concerts et showcases radio, le groupe décide de dévoiler une facette plus posée en rodant un set acoustique entièrement revisité pour en faire une captation live. Celle-ci figurera sur la version ""deluxe"" de leur EP qui sortira en 2013 sur le label ""Send The Wood"", distribué physiquement par ""Season Of Mist"" dans de nombreux points de vente en France. </p>
<p>Hell Of A Ride fera alors de nombreuses apparitions dans des Festivals Rock/Metal franciliens (Mennecy Metal Fest, Triel Open Air...) et dans l'émission ""Une Dose 2 Metal"" présentée par Stéphane Buriez (Loudblast)...</p>

En route pour l'enfer



Hell Of A Ride c'est un éboulement sonore de gros riffs, de rythmiques lourdes, une explosion de moteur V8 chargé à la nitroglycérine, une virée d'enfer portée par un Heavy ""Stunt"" Rock aux accents de Metal, au parfum de Southern Rock et aux racines de Hard Rock. 

Non seulement le groupe s'offre un arsenal auditif puissant et rôdé, mais il s'appuie sur un univers visuel fort, inspiré d'un cinéma galvanisé au Rock'N'Roll. Il suffit d'écouter les titres de leur EP ""Fast As Lightning"" (produit par Charles ""Kallaghan"" Massabo) pour être transporté dans cet univers bercé par la soif de vivre, la revanche, la nostalgie et l'adrénaline. 
C'est sur cette trame que Hell Of A Ride s'est bâtit une réputation scénique fulgurante, amenant le groupe à jouer en première partie de Black Stone Cherry (USA) dans une Maroquinerie pleine à craquer avec un public réactif dès les premières notes du Show. Enchaînant concerts et showcases radio, le groupe décide de dévoiler une facette plus posée en rodant un set acoustique entièrement revisité pour en faire une captation live. Celle-ci figurera sur la version ""deluxe"" de leur EP qui sortira en 2013 sur le label ""Send The Wood"", distribué physiquement par ""Season Of Mist"" dans de nombreux points de vente en France. 
Hell Of A Ride fera alors de nombreuses apparitions dans des Festivals Rock/Metal franciliens (Mennecy Metal Fest, Triel Open Air...) et dans l'émission ""Une Dose 2 Metal"" présentée par Stéphane Buriez (Loudblast)...

Avec Hell Of A Ride, préparez-vous à vivre au rythme d'une course poursuite infernale !




Faites partie de notre histoire
Nous sommes vraiment impatients de vous faire découvrir notre nouvel opus. Nous avons toujours porté à coeur de vous faire vibrer aussi bien par notre musique que par notre image.C'est pourquoi, pour franchir cette prochaine étape dans notre histoire et vous faire découvrir en avant première la bête, avant sa sortie mondiale le 26 octobre 2015, nous avons plus que jamais besoin de vous.Peu importe ce que l'industrie de la musique est devenue au fil des années, il y aura toujours une chose sur laquelle nous pourrons compter, votre soutien. Nous voulons que ce nouvel album soit quelque chose d'unique pour vous comme pour nous et dont nous pourrons tous être fiers.

A chacun sa ""Bête noire""

""Bête Noire"" est le premier album studio de Hell Of A Ride, enregistré à Paris par Charles ""Kallaghan"" Massabo et mixé/masterisé par ses soins à Los Angeles. Ces 11 titres démontrent tout le savoir-faire du groupe en matière de refrains accrocheurs et fédérateurs avec une énergie maîtrisée à la perfection. Rempli de subtils clins d’œil aux monuments du Hard Rock et du Metal de ces 20 dernières années, ""Bête Noire"" offre une explosion de morceaux addictifs. De ""Aphrodisiac Cadillac"", véritable hymne de débauche Rock'N'Roll,  à la ballade abrasive ""Rain Of Fuel"", H.o.a.R vous transportera, rappelant la machine rythmique d'AC/DC, les riffs sexy des Guns'N'Roses et de Nickelback, la puissance de Metallica et les envolées mélodiques de Shinedown et d'Alter Bridge. Le tout porté par une sonorité riche en couleurs, digne de groupes tels que Faith No More, Korn ou encore Marylin Manson, Hell Of A Ride sait manier un large registre sans jamais tomber dans les clichés. 
L'album sera edité en version Digipack avec un CD de 11 titres, une superbe qualité visuelle, un contenu exclusif, un booklet racontant la suite des aventures de john ""MAD DOG"" Ringsdale. La version numérique bénéficiera, elle aussi, de ce contenu en version pdf. Il sera disponible chez tous les disquaires, plateformes d'écoute et de téléchargement numérique le 26 octobre prochain.

I can't lie, I do love my job but mainly for the reason of meeting new people. Of course, Liverpool does have nice buildings and I'm sure some of you will agree. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF THE IDEA</b></div>
<div>Okay people, here it goes... Im a Liverpool based Music loverrr who wants to start up , ' Crowd festival'. I've been working on this idea for numerous years and now it is ready to wear it's wellies! As they say you have to walk before you can run, I fully believe this idea is ready to run...<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You may ask what makes this festival any different from the rest? Well, this is where it gets good. This festival is different because it is funded by <b>US</b> for <b>US</b>! In my opinion this should mean <b>WE</b> get to choose the line up? Well if you were thinking the same, then you would be correct in thinking so. How exciting is this?!? <b>WE</b> are in control of what will be the biggest community based festival in the world.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>'Crowd festival' will have an online voting poll which will allow <b>US</b> to elect any act <b>WE</b> want. This is a crowd fund based exercise so I will say depending on the amount raised will depend on what acts are affordable within <b>OUR</b> funding community. But I'm sure <b>YOU </b>had already realised that! As this is all about team work, <b>WE </b>can decide what we do with any left over money, there will be options available for <b>YOU </b>to choose from in terms of donating to charity and even down to how <b>WE</b> advertise. I am as much apart of this plan as <b>YOU</b> guys! After all, a community based brain is better than a single one and as the saying goes, 'together, we can achieve anything'.</div>
<div><br/></div>My aim is to bring people together with all kinds of music tastes and create a social environment where we can all experience new music and get a long. Whether you like Black Keys or Calvin Harris, my goal is to have a place <b>WE</b> can enjoy both. It is not much to ask for is it, after all <b>WE </b>like what <b>WE</b> like! Gone are the days <b>WE</b> pay for our ticket and have a line up given to us.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Festival will be held over a three day period in August 2016. We aim to have ten top of the chart acts on each day with a lot of new and upcoming artists playing their own stages. There will be a mixture of style and sound at 'CrowdFestival' it will be everything from Electronic, Dance/House through to Indie Rock and Metal. The best thing is we can decide who plays! </div><div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>THE COSTS</b><br/>
</div>
<div>I will start this section by saying that if we do not meet the funds required to take our festival straight to the top we will still run it regardless and provide a Crowdfunded Festival. We will definitely continue to grow our Community each year and provide great Music for us by us. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>Anyone who donates for a, 'ticket option' will receive a valid ticket for the Festival. The website will be launched when we reach £15,000 in total. The first acts will be posted for vote when we reach £50,000. When we reach £250,000, that is when things get super exciting! Let's do this!!<div><br/></div>
<div>Okay, so back to what this section is about, through extensive research, 'Crowd Festival' have calculated the running and maintenance cost to be Two Million Pounds to make this the event of a lifetime. If we reach 5 million pound then that can only mean an even better festival! We will make sure this is something worth donating too. I agree, It does sound a lot but with anything extreme, it sooner becomes much more possible as long as we have people around us to help. This money will cover staff wages, acts, land hire and maintenance costs. This won't be a walk in the park, there is a lot of planning to do but together we can do anything. A man with a pound in his pocket can not achieve what a community of 5 milliton can when they put their pounds together. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>WHAT IS NEXT</b></div>
</div><div>Once we have succesfully reached our goal and the polling is completed, every ticket entitled person will receive their tickets bio 1st class recorded delivery . I bet you cannot wait now, I know i can't! 'Crowd Festival' will take place the summer of 2016. The location will be confirmed once the Campaign has finished. Im sure we all have a few ideas in mind!

WHO AM I?
Ill start by introducing myself. My name is Michael Evers which some of you may find hilarious as Im here asking you all to help set up the best festival we've ever heard of and the person who set up Glastonbury is called, Michael Eavis. Haha I know! Here I am trying to set up a festival... Anyway, my friends call me Mike, I don't mind either but what I do mind is the fact I don't know who is asking for me when I'm with my dad, yes you have guessed it, my dad is also called Michael Evers! 


My job... Currently I work as an Estate Agent, dealing with property in and around Liverpool and now you're asking why Im here trying to do this, so I will tell you. I like to think of myself as a people person and real life interaction for me, is what life is about. But that is my opinion, this may differ for other people, after all, the internet is a great place and that's why i'm here! I can't lie, I do love my job but mainly for the reason of meeting new people. Of course, Liverpool does have nice buildings and I'm sure some of you will agree. 

YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF THE IDEA
Okay people, here it goes... Im a Liverpool based Music loverrr who wants to start up , ' Crowd festival'. I've been working on this idea for numerous years and now it is ready to wear it's wellies! As they say you have to walk before you can run, I fully believe this idea is ready to run...


You may ask what makes this festival any different from the rest? Well, this is where it gets good. This festival is different because it is funded by US for US! In my opinion this should mean WE get to choose the line up? Well if you were thinking the same, then you would be correct in thinking so. How exciting is this?!? WE are in control of what will be the biggest community based festival in the world.

'Crowd festival' will have an online voting poll which will allow US to elect any act WE want. This is a crowd fund based exercise so I will say depending on the amount raised will depend on what acts are affordable within OUR funding community. But I'm sure YOU had already realised that! As this is all about team work, WE can decide what we do with any left over money, there will be options available for YOU to choose from in terms of donating to charity and even down to how WE advertise.

<p>Having both graduated from University with photography degrees, it became apparent that there is a lack of traditional  photographic darkrooms in Kent. With hundreds of photography students leaving universities, colleges and schools locally each year having studied hard and gained darkroom expertise and qualifications; as well as artists and hobbyist's who also use or are interested to learn traditional analogue photography and printing methods, we realised that there is a real need for an affordable facility that reflect the on-going revival of film photography.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Darkroom Project will provide a range of photographic services. The  main Darkroom will houses 9 enlargers –  35mm, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">medium</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> and large format. There will also be a negative developing booth, negative drying cabinet and print drying rack. Next to The Darkroom will be a viewing room with light boxes and a print retouching area. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Darkroom will also offer a variety of workshops pitched at a varying abilities; from first timers to ‘master-classes’ where professionals can hone their skills in specific printing methods. ""Alternative"" historic techniques will also be taught. One to one tuition and support plus career progression to photographers of all abilities will be available.</p>
<p>Bookings will be  for a morning or afternoon session.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Tuesday – Friday morning session (10am-1pm)</span></p>

<p>Each session costs £15 and all users will be required to pay an annual Resort Facilities Membership fee of £35 before using The Darkroom; this will also give members the use of ALL Resort's Hire facilities, including <a href=""http://www.helloprintstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hello Print Studio</a>,  <a href=""http://www.resortstudios.co.uk/studios-facilities/firebird-jewellery-studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Firebird Jewellery Studio</a> and<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> access to the Resort Gallery -The Darkroom will invite its users to submit work for an annual show.</span></p>

</div><div> <p>Traditional photographic darkrooms have been in steady decline since the emergence of digital photography and Photoshop. We feel it is important to keep film photography and darkroom printing techniques alive. We have nothing against digital photography and software editing but nothing beats the joy of 'making' a photograph; the developing of the negative and printing process is magical when you see a fine art photographic print appear before your very eyes. It is still a wonder to experience and it is always a joy to be 'hands on' in the creation process. </p>

and Jo Bridges We are two professional photographers who are passionate about film photography and traditional printing techniques. 
Having both graduated from University with photography degrees, it became apparent that there is a lack of traditional  photographic darkrooms in Kent. With hundreds of photography students leaving universities, colleges and schools locally each year having studied hard and gained darkroom expertise and qualifications; as well as artists and hobbyist's who also use or are interested to learn traditional analogue photography and printing methods, we realised that there is a real need for an affordable facility that reflect the on-going revival of film photography.
The Darkroom Project will provide a range of photographic services. The  main Darkroom will houses 9 enlargers –  35mm, medium and large format. There will also be a negative developing booth, negative drying cabinet and print drying rack. Next to The Darkroom will be a viewing room with light boxes and a print retouching area. 

The Darkroom will also offer a variety of workshops pitched at a varying abilities; from first timers to ‘master-classes’ where professionals can hone their skills in specific printing methods. ""Alternative"" historic techniques will also be taught. One to one tuition and support plus career progression to photographers of all abilities will be available.
Bookings will be  for a morning or afternoon session.
Tuesday – Friday morning session (10am-1pm)
Tuesday – Friday afternoon session (2-5pm)
Each session costs £15 and all users will be required to pay an annual Resort Facilities Membership fee of £35 before using The Darkroom; this will also give members the use of ALL Resort's Hire facilities, including Hello Print Studio,  Firebird Jewellery Studio and access to the Resort Gallery -The Darkroom will invite its users to submit work for an annual show.
We have done a lot of the core structural work ourselves
                                                               and have been very lucky and are very grateful to professional photographer Jason Evans and The Ramsgate Music Hall for hosting three fund-raising gigs which has raised the funds to enable us to complete the electrics and plumbing.
We are in the final stages of completion and with your help, we hope to raise the £2,500 we need to able to complete our project and to get the space ready to welcome the first members in September.     What We Need & What You Get We need to raise £2,500  to: 
Install the workstations; 
Buy the negative drying cabinet;
Have the print racks built 
and to enable us to have all our equipment PAT tested for safety.
In Return we offer various ""Thank you"" rewards ranging from hand made fine art photographic prints, to complimentary darkroom sessions, one to one tuition and workshops. 
If we do not reach our £2,500 goal, we will put what donations we have received towards buying as much of the remaining items and services we need to reach completion, so you can rest assured every single penny we raise will be used to get The Darkroom Project up and running. 
The Impact
 Traditional photographic darkrooms have been in steady decline since the emergence of digital photography and Photoshop. We feel it is important to keep film photography and darkroom printing techniques alive. We have nothing against digital photography and software editing but nothing beats the joy of 'making' a photograph; the developing of the negative and printing process is magical when you see a fine art photographic print appear before your very eyes. It is still a wonder to experience and it is always a joy to be 'hands on' in the creation process. 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute a financial donation,  this doesn't mean you can't help:
If you have a spare working negative drying cabinet or print drying rack or if you are qualified to PAT test electrical equipment, then we would be very grateful!

My name is Jason Christopher and I'm a singer/songwriter originally from Athens, Al.  I've been involved in music since I was in the second grade in some shape form or fashion... Anywhere from singing lead soprano in the local Boy's choir, My high school band playing the snare drum, playing my very first songs at open mic nights in college, and finally to signed songwriter in Nashville.  I LOVE MAKING MUSIC!  Plain and Simple! I also love Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior! My whole life I've been a believer, but at the same time I guess I always had it in my head that ""I will settle down and be a good little christian soon, but for now it's about ""me"".  Uhhhggg, that pains me to write, but it's the truth! Or WAS the truth that is!  About a year ago, Jesus came to my front door, knocked on it, and snatched me right out of my shoes when I opened the door! ;)  Seriously, he started working on me in a BIG way and I have been blessed beyond belief, as well as have personally witnessed many miracles during this short amount of time. Needless to say, I now live my entire life with him at the front of every thought. That said, my goals have changed. I don't mean my style or anything like that, I mean I feel divinely inspired! I feel inspired to bring music back to something that is real, inspirational, emotional, and ""good"". Enough of the songs about killing, raping, degrading women, worshiping false idols, and so on and so forth. </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>I’ve decided to join Indiegogo and
ask for help from <b>LOVERS OF JESUS AND  MUSIC FROM
ACROSS THE GLOBE </b>so I can make a “real” and genuine album.  One that is the same quality as
one of the really big studios would put out. What do I mean by “real” album?<span>  I mean that it’s straight from my soul, and I
don’t want anyone telling me what I can and can’t “feel” when sharing my music
that came straight from my life, experiences and own personal creative takes on
things! You see, I’m a song writer and as such an artist...Telling me this or that won't fly is like telling a painter that he's not allowed to use the color red!  I don’t churn out 10 songs a month that are
radio ready for the masses of people that the big labels have brainwashed into
thinking are great! I’m a Christian and a country boy with a lot of soul and a rock and roll
heart! Hear the music from this album I want to make, and you’ll know exactly
what I’m talking about! All I’m asking for is the chance (with all else being
equal) to prove to YOU that people want to hear “genuine” music that isn’t manufactured
by “The Machine”. You see, I believe that ""pop music"" is directly inspired by the devil himself and has consequently brainwashed people into thinking that crap is good music and is morally good for people to listen to.  If you can help me make this album, then you’ll be helping me achieve this goal. You’ll also help open doors for the 1000’s
of other creative minded (and really talented) people that don’t want to sell
their soul and creativity out to a mainstream record label. That goal alone
should be enough to either help me out, or find someone like me and help them ""jumpstart"" their career.  Thank you again
for even taking the time to visit my page! 
God Bless all of you! </span></p>
<p><b>What
I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I know that $15,000 seems
lofty.<span>  However, you have to realize that
I’m making a go of this alone, as well as I want to do this is the most
professional way possible.  When you
break down doing an album on this scale you have to consider the following: </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>It’s
anywhere from $50-$100 per instrument, per song for just the musicians.<span>  So at a rate of $75 and 4 musicians, that is
$3,000 spent right there.  </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Renting
the studio is another huge expense.<span>  At
any reputable studio this is a major expense. 
Let’s just say that I can find one for $400 per day. Hopefully, I can
get through this in 4 days for the basic stuff. 
That’s another $1600! </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Then you
have all the “variables” that will be hard to put an exact number on, but there
is paying the sound engineer.<span>  He/ She
will charge by the hour, or they will figure it in to the cost of renting the
studio which will at least double the cost of the studio fees. </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Producer.<span>  While I absolutely want to have a huge part
of this, I am not on this side of the table so I need someone to guide me and
the rest of the musicians.  I have
friends, so let’s say I can do this for $1,000</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Mixing and
Mastering.<span>  This is where (usually) a
totally different sound engineer/producer hybrid person will take each track,
break it down and adjust all the many sound levels associated with them.  This is also where I would do the “real”
singing part.  This will cost on average
another $150 per song which will tack on another $1500</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Finally
there are all the expenses that are related to the release of the songs and the
album itself.<span>  We are talking about a
website, promotions, hard copy’s, copywriters fees and miscellaneous fee’s from
every Tom, Dick and Harry that tells you that you have to license your music in
certain ways in order to protect it and get credit for it.  I have absolutely zero idea as to how much
this will cost, but I know from just releasing some songs on basic internet
channels can get not only expensive, but also very confusing.  </span></p>
<p><b>WHAT
YOU WILL RECEIVE IN RETURN FOR YOUR GENEROSITY.<span> 
</span></b></p>
<p><b>I
don’t want to leave anyone that donates even $1 out, so here is what I can
promise.<span>  </span></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Every
single person that donates anything will receive a personal letter of gratitude
from me, as well as a digital copy of all songs on the album before I release
it. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>For anyone
who Donates $50 to $499,<span>  you will
receive all of the above, plus one of
the first hard copies of the album that will be signed by me with a personal
thanks.  You will also receive a hard
copy of any album I release in the future. 
</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>For anyone
who Donates $500 to $4999 will receive all of the above PLUS 2 tickets to my
release party that I can PROMISE YOU will be a super fun event in
Nashville.<span>  You will also receive 2
tickets to ANY EVENT I am a part of for one year after the albums initial
release!  You will
also get a special mention and “thank you” on any hard copies of the album that
gets distributed as well as the same on any website that is mine. </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>For anyone
who Donates more than $5,000, well you’ll be my favorite person on the planet
for years to come!<span>  You’ll of course get
everything above,  but you’ll also have
tickets to ANY SHOW that I EVER PLAY for the rest of my life!  You’ll also get transportation, hotel and will be by my  side at the release party in Nashville.  You'll also receive one of my personal guitars, autographed and with a special thank you etched in. </span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Look,<span>  I’m not sitting here all jaded and thinking
that I’m going to be the next ""big thing"". That's not even my point or my goal!  I do believe in myself, my
vision, my creativity and my talent enough to think that it’s possible to help make ""real"" and ""decent""  music popular again!   How about this though…… If this album has ANY
sort of success at all,  it will help to
open the doors and let real inspiration and creativity rule the roost again, instead of the “machines”
that pump out music that people just THINK they like! Wouldn’t it be cool if
you joined me on this journey and became a part of something REALLY IMPORTANT
to music in general?  That really
important part would be shifted from the labels and back making the artists and
the Fans the important parts of music again? 
It used to be like this folks! 
That freedom has slowly eroded through the years!  HELP ME TAKE IT BACK! </span></p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Of course there are risks and
challenges.<span>  None of the songs may ever
get downloaded.  You just can’t predict
that! What I can tell you is that EVERY
SINGLE DIME of the funds I raise will go towards the music and promotion of this music project.  The more money I’m able to raise,
the better quality music I can make and the MORE I CAN PROMOTE IT!  </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I have been in this game for 10 years.<span>  I KNOW how to navigate it.  I also have learned many valuable
     lessons that will hopefully keep this project from being an epic flop.</span>
</li>
<li>I have written with and shared the stage with tons of
     super successful musicians.<span>  There
     are individuals that I “could” ask for help, but I have chosen this avenue
     because I really want to see how much interest I can build on this thing,
     and I honestly BELIEVE IN IT!  I
     also don’t want to ask one person for this kind of money.  Success or not, I would personally feel
     like I owed one person way too much. 
     Plus, most of those people are fine with letting the machine pick
     what music hits the masses! </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute,
but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about
     this project! This really is something that someone needs to do in order
     to “fix” the music industry as it stands today!<span>  I REALLY want to have a part in this,
     and by you simply sharing this story, you can have a part of it too! </span>
</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools! That’s why they are there!

The title Namhlanje , means Today , translated into IsiXhosa, an indigenous South African language.  It is a song about hope and fighting for your dreams .  We are also planning to record a live music video for this song. Although our  main objective is to raise the euros to record a professional CD, this campaign to me means more than recording a CD. We would like to bring awareness to musical educational programs in Africa and we would like to donate a small percentage to an Ngo named Agua de Coco, who have established a co-curricular  activity in Madagascar to promote Musical Education programs to young children and also to give children a safe haven to go to after school, to keep them off the streets.We believe that music unites, educates and brings people together and this is the ideology that my music hopes to achieve. We should all raise our awareness of important issues in the world and I believe the most important place to start is through Education.  As the late Tata Nelson Mandela said ¨Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world¨",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Long term friends, musician <b>Marina Gasolina</b> and film director <b>Fernando Nogari</b> spent two weeks during last summer traveling in former Yugoslavian territories. They visited there some  famous monuments/ WWII memorials, called Spomeniks. They already had plans on working together, and this journey gave them the inspiration they needed. They saw in these derelict constructions, the perfect environment to stage a sequence of audiovisual performances unified by one central theme: <b>Utopia and its impossibility</b>; themes Marina explores in her new album to be released, co-produced by Ladytron's <b>Daniel Hunt</b>. </p>
<p>The goal is to shoot a movie over 7 performances about 7 songs in 7 Yugoslavian monuments with the collaboration of Haute Coiffure artist <b>Charlie Le Mindu</b>, who will sign the art direction.</p>

<p>Hi, I am
Triana, a young singer songwriter. I have played music all of my life. Lately
my song writing has really taken off and I’ve put together enough music to make
my first CD. I am really excited about it! It is an amazing dream that is
coming true. My family and some really great and talented friends have banded
together and are working hard with me to get it done. Good things are starting to happen, but
I am at a point in the project where I need some additional financial support
to create and deliver a quality recording.</p>
<p>The additional
funding of $6,700 is needed to pay for studio time, additional recording equipment, and the printing of the
CD’s. I need your support in order for this recording to happen. Making this recording will bring my songs out into the world in a real way. It is important to me to be able to share them with you and I believe you will all really enjoy the CD we are making together with your help. My hope is
to raise enough money with this Indiegogo campaign to accomplish all this.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<p>The community of amazing artists that I am surrounded by are working to create unique t-shirts and posters for this project. With their help I am able to
offer some really neat stuff in return for your financial support.<span> Right now I have Triana t-shirts and posters available
for you. With your donation you are becoming a part of this recording project and are helping to launch a musical
artist. <br/></span></p>

much for checking this out. Please share this campaign with your friends.</p>

experience!  We blend ritual, ceremony, music, sound, dance, story, 
mythology and astrology in a way that serves to awaken, inspire, unify 
and heal humanity.  Visionary mystics Donny Regalmuto and Heather Salmon
 bring decades of experience as professional performers, healers, 
producers and agents of social change.  Guided by the energies of 
astrology, the cycles of nature as well as planetary and current issues 
these popular cutting edge prayerformances have been featured at Burning
 Man, and festivals including the Health and Harmony Festival, Alchemy 
Festival, Journey Home, Maui's Earth Day Festival, the One Peace 
Festival and Mystic Garden & Island Festivals, as well as the Walnut
 Creek Crystal Fair, conferences, retreat and cultural centers, hot 
springs, churches, temples and yoga studios across California, Hawaii, 
Oregon, Mexico and Canada!  We have collaborated with some of the 
world's finest musicians, renown spiritual teachers and luminaries 
including the late Lady Loreon Vigne the ArchPriestess of the Temple of 
Isis (Geyserville, California), Hawaiian Kahuna Auntie Pua, Oakland 
Cosmic Mass creator Rev. Dr. Matthew Fox, South African born spiritual 
teacher Mirabai Devi, Makeda Dread the legendary radio personality and 
executive director of San Diego's famous World Beat Center, Devaa Haley 
and Stephen Dinan of the Shift Network, as well as visionary artists 
Alex and Allyson Grey.  Most recently we are excited to announce
 that Black Swan has been contracted to appear as ourselves in an 
upcoming feature film.  Ever creating ever expanding, our hope 
is that our work will help to elevate global consciousness and inspire 
and bring about a peaceful, thriving and just human experience on 
Earth.  

GOALS
To date, we have been mostly self-funding and now we are seeking support in attaining our next goals of:
1.  Creating a funding base for our community events so that 
they can be accessible to all by subsidizing the production costs which 
would also enable us to do larger events and webcasts.
2.  Purchasing more AV Equipment for our Maui studio to video and audio record events produce media.
3.  Adding to our collection of instruments including 
purchasing more special semi precious crystal singing bowls for our 
sound healing.
4.  Marketing our 18 CD + 1 DVD Collection to expand sales and generate revenue.
In addition, as we are a ministry of the Black Swan Temple, a
 Project of Inquiring Systems, Inc. a California 501(c)(3) Corporation 
we are able to offer Tax Deductible Receipts for donations.

Here is what your contribution will immediately help support:
*  Production costs for our Winter Solstice Community Ceremony at Maui's renown Lumeria Center (Dec. 21st)
*  Our New Year's tour with dates in Toronto (Dec. 28th) and Harbin Hot Springs (Jan. 3rd)
*  New Video Cameras
*  Special Effects and Stage Lighting 
*  Sound & AV Production Equipment
*  Website Development & Online Mystery School
*  Publicity & Promotion
*  Management Fees
We thank you so much for your consideration in helping us 
raise funds to support the expansion of our work into the world.  You 
can also help by sharing this campaign with your friends!  If you've 
enjoyed our events, rituals or ceremonies please let others know that 
too!
We wish you all the best for this holy day season!
Much Love & Aloha!

<p>I am so excited to nurture what started as a handful of demos recorded on my home microphone into something full, professional and unique.</p>

<p>I have teamed-up with a wild, talented creative artist/musician to work on my debut EP album. His name is Jose Bila Rodriguez, better known as ""Compay"" Jose.

<p>We're a non-profit organisation loosely based on the U.S. Rock n Roll Camp for Girls model, the first of it's kind in Scotland!  </p>
<p>We just ran 6 weeks of vocals, guitar, bass and drums workshops for women and trans*folk on a shoestring budget with borrowed equipment and a lot of improvisation (we literally hauled the amps and guitars to the venue by bike trailer every week!).  We had no idea how successful it would be, but the demand surpassed our wildest dreams!</p>
<p>We want to run an autumn term, with extra workshops in activities like sound engineering, music tech, and DJing, which women are generally not encouraged to take part in.  In

have found that external funders have been reluctant to pay for. That’s where
you come in!  <br/><span><span><span></span></span></span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>We need gear!<br/>
</h3>We managed to pick up an old battered drum kit that was languishing in a
 second hand shop, but it's missing cymbals, and someone donated us a bass guitar and amp, but apart from that we've been using our own personal guitars and borrowing amps!  Here's what we reckon we need to keep going for years to come (we're eco-conscious and will be purchasing everything second hand wherever possible!)<br/><br/>A hi hat stand and cymbals, two bass guitars, two bass practice amps, two electric guitars, two practice amps, a keyboard, four sets of drumsticks, and some string sets.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>But why does the world need a Girls Rock School?</h3> <p>We feel that projects like GRS are important
because women aren't encouraged to pick up electric instruments or get behind the drums, and  if they do
they're expected to wear as little as possible.  In fact, it’s difficult for women at every stage of becoming a musician. There’s 
not enough role models, and the female musicians who are visible are 
usually airbrushed and pouting on the covers of magazines and album 
covers, making young girls feel that they have to sexualise themselves 
to get anywhere. If they do make it in to the local music shop they can 
expect to be patronised by the male staff, and then when they form a 
band, they end up forever playing lower down the bill while male bands 
headline.</p>
<p>Girls Rock School is open to ALL women, including transwomen, and also genderqueer people.  We ensure that all of our workshop spaces and venues are wheelchair accessible, and we don't discriminate on age, race, religious denomination, or anything else you can think of.  Our workshops are free (although we encourage those who can afford it to donate what they can to help us cover venue costs) so they're accessible to those on low incomes. <br/></p>

This has been Liz's dream, and with your help, we can create it!   What We Need & What You Get We're looking to fully fund the album by reaching our campaign goal of raising $10,000, which would allow for a stellar full-length album to be recorded at Songfield Studios in Los Angeles, California. For contributing, you'll get AWESOME perks like an autographed copy of the final product, concert tickets, super cute totes, or even your very own PRIVATE SHOW!
    The Impact Liz's passion is positivity and optimism and she knows that through sending out positive vibes and energy starting from within yourself, a domino effect of positivity and joy flows through planet earth and out into the cosmos! By contributing to her campaign, YOU ARE CREATING THAT POSITIVE ENERGY FLOW! Wow, you are one rockin' human being! (Unless, you're an alien, of course, and if so, welcome to earth!) 
    Risks & Challenges There's always a million reasons not to do something. Liz was born with an almost unhealthy determination for manifesting her dreams into reality and with the help of the committed, like-minded people at Songfield Studios, Liz is prepared to overcome and conquer any challenges that occur. Even if we don't reach the campaign goal, we'll still put whatever funds we raise to make the best damn album ever! 
    Other Ways You Can Help You can also help our cause by just following Liz on her journey, reaching out via social media, and supporting her artistic endeavors on Patreon.com. There you can donate a buck or two for every music video she releases, which also helps with production costs and creating new art! http://patreon.com/LizFanoraJones
THANK YOU SO MUCH for checking out this campaign! We hope to hear from you soon!www.LizFanoraJones.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A celebration of youth turning their lives around and starting a new chapter, which includes positive role models and clean fun.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>  <b>The day-in-the-park will include:</b> </div>
<div>a) Early morning filming for video of album release for one of our volunteers </div>
<div>b) Early afternoon BBQ for families &amp; volunteers </div>
<div>c) Fun/game activities for teens and adults emphasizing team building and cooperation with others </div>
<div>d) Concert starting in early evening (5-8pm) Christian contemporary worship &amp;  Christian RAP artists... intermingled between songs with Mentee testimonies.</div>
<div>We have over 100 youth and their siblings who need to learn how to have good, clean fun...without breaking the law!</div>
<div>Surrounding neighborhood youth from inner city Sacramento are also invited.</div>
<div>We hope to attract several hundred ""high-potential"" boys and girls.<br/><br/>Since this is a free event, we are asking anyone who can help donate to offset for costs of organizing the outreach and renting the park. <br/><br/><b>If you would like to donate, please donate on this page and look up the ""GAP concert"". </b><br/><br/>Or go to our website and use PayPal. <a href=""http://www.gapgangs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gapgangs.com</a> <br/><br/><h3>

</h3>
</div>
<div> <p><b>Details:</b></p> <ul> <li>WE need $500 for the cost of the City Park Fees and another $500 for food: Hotdogs, buns, chips, soda, water, etc.  <b>Total $1,000</b>
</li>
<li>We are going to feed a lot of people!</li> <li> If we don't reach our entire goal we will still do the BBQ-- have FUN activities and Feed whoever comes! It will simply have to come out of our personal pockets....which we are used to. </li>
<li>But the fact is we don't have budget for this. We don't get any government funding and there are NO major donors. </li>
<li>Volunteers are who we are! ""Do gooders"" who go into the juvenile jails and county and state prison. </li>
<li>We simply NEED your help keeping the young people, boys &amp; girls away from illegal activities and a thug lifestyle.</li>

<p>Our goal is to provide parents and guardians with alternative opportunities, helping youth to constructively realize their full potential.</p>
<p><b>We are also looking for mentors: </b>Once a week or bi-weekly spending one on one time with a youth, listening without judgment and giving advice when needed.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>We have a proven plan for helping to solve the rampant recidivism (criminal behavior that leads to re-arrest) we face in this country today. </div>
<div>We spend Monday &amp; Wednesday evenings  and Saturday mornings every week building relationships with incarcerated youth in Sacramento County. We have dozens of trained and experienced volunteers who have BIG hearts. We meet with about 100-150 boys and girls each week.</div>
<div>The <b>challenge </b>is proving to them that there is an alternative to criminal and gang behavior. The <b>risk </b>is that we miss some because we don't have enough volunteers and are woefully underfunded. The <b>reality</b> is that more teenagers will commit violent crimes and someone will be killed because we weren't able to reach them in time.</div> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><b>Today’s youth seek four things:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Action: </b>Words and promises are not enough – someone to listen and walk beside them </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Consistency:</b> A trustworthy advisor – a person they can count on in hard times</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Truth:</b> Excuses and fabrications destroy truth – someone to empower them with biblical truths </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Time:</b> Time and attention from a caring adult – a mentor </span></li>

</div></div>","Gang Awareness & Prevention; a.k.a. God Answers Prayers is holding its inaugural “Day-in-the-Park” event called ‘Stay Lit’  

When: August 30th 2015  Noon- 8pm 
What: “Stay Lit” BBQ-youth activities and concert for at-risk youth 

Who: All Mentors/Mentees and their families 


Why: This event is primarily for Mentors & Mentees of formerly incarcerated boys & girls. A celebration of youth turning their lives around and starting a new chapter, which includes positive role models and clean fun.


  The day-in-the-park will include: 
a) Early morning filming for video of album release for one of our volunteers 
b) Early afternoon BBQ for families & volunteers 
c) Fun/game activities for teens and adults emphasizing team building and cooperation with others 
d) Concert starting in early evening (5-8pm) Christian contemporary worship &  Christian RAP artists... intermingled between songs with Mentee testimonies.
We have over 100 youth and their siblings who need to learn how to have good, clean fun...without breaking the law!
Surrounding neighborhood youth from inner city Sacramento are also invited.
We hope to attract several hundred ""high-potential"" boys and girls.Since this is a free event, we are asking anyone who can help donate to offset for costs of organizing the outreach and renting the park. If you would like to donate, please donate on this page and look up the ""GAP concert"". Or go to our website and use PayPal. www.gapgangs.com 
What We Need 


 Details:  WE need $500 for the cost of the City Park Fees and another $500 for food: Hotdogs, buns, chips, soda, water, etc.  Total $1,000

We are going to feed a lot of people!  If we don't reach our entire goal we will still do the BBQ-- have FUN activities and Feed whoever comes! It will simply have to come out of our personal pockets....which we are used to. 
But the fact is we don't have budget for this. We don't get any government funding and there are NO major donors. 
Volunteers are who we are! ""Do gooders"" who go into the juvenile jails and county and state prison. 
We simply NEED your help keeping the young people, boys & girls away from illegal activities and a thug lifestyle.

We will do our part to rebuild the foundations of this lost generation.          Ezekiel 22:30.



What You Get


Perks~ Free dvd's from the artists and some of the BBQ if you come and join us

Satisfaction of knowing you helped keep the streets of this city a safer place
Understanding that showing wayward youth a different way to have fun is a huge step toward a changed life! Our mentor will stay in their life (see below)


The Impact 

G.A.P. 2015 Mission~ Rescue 50 young people in the Sacramento area from the violence, crime and desperation found in their relationships and neighborhoods
Our AIM:
Awareness – To the community, churches and parents                                     Interaction – Youth organizations, government agencies and law enforcement Mentoring – For aimless youth of all ages in the Sacramento region
Our goal is to provide parents and guardians with alternative opportunities, helping youth to constructively realize their full potential.
We are also looking for mentors: Once a week or bi-weekly spending one on one time with a youth, listening without judgment and giving advice when needed.
For further information about how YOU can become a mentor or help us rescue youth contact: 
        Randal Broadhurst (916) 804-7980       E-Mail: randal.gapgangs@gmail.com

Risks & Challenges
We have a proven plan for helping to solve the rampant recidivism (criminal behavior that leads to re-arrest) we face in this country today. 
We spend Monday & Wednesday evenings  and Saturday mornings every week building relationships with incarcerated youth in Sacramento County. We have dozens of trained and experienced volunteers who have BIG hearts. We meet with about 100-150 boys and girls each week.
The challenge is proving to them that there is an alternative to criminal and gang behavior. The risk is that we miss some because we don't have enough volunteers and are woefully underfunded. The reality is that more teenagers will commit violent crimes and someone will be killed because we weren't able to reach them in time. 




Today’s youth seek four things:


Action: Words and promises are not enough – someone to listen and walk beside them 
Consistency: A trustworthy advisor – a person they can count on in hard times
Truth: Excuses and fabrications destroy truth – someone to empower them with biblical truths 
Time: Time and attention from a caring adult – a mentor 


   Other Ways You Can Help Join us as a volunteer. We have many other ways you can use your talents.
Other funding needs (besides the above event):

Books for Juvenile Hall libraries 
Shirts & hats: Mentees “Youth Group” kids after release: (“Keepin’ it 100”)
Videos/Movies: demonstrating character, integrity, honesty, work ethic, family, marriage, and many more! Donate for units inside Youth Detention Facilities.

<p><span>Stories have paid the mortgage for nearly two decades. I am a professional storyteller, musician and vocalist. Sharing stories and songs rooted in the African  oral tradition has been my j-o-b since 1996. Now, I have an opportunity to perform in West Africa. </span></p>
<p><span>The National Association of Black Storytellers Inc. (NABS) has invited me to perform at Panafest.  Additionally, I get to participate in the Inter-Continental Scholarly Exchange on the Preservation of the African Oral Tradition through Black Storytelling. Both the festival and scholarly exchange will take place in Ghana, West Africa December  1-19, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span>The stories and songs I perform are derived from both my personal experience as a woman of African descent, from the traditions handed down from my parents, as well as from my scholarly research. This project affords me an opportunity to go to the source of my cultural roots for the very first time and not only collect stories, but to participate in an academic discussion about African storytelling with a diverse assembly of people. </span></p>
<p><span>Contributors to this project play a huge role! </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>How This Project Impacts Me Personally</b></p>
<p><i>Storytime....</i></p>
<p>This crowd funding campaign is being launched on Sept. 9 in memory of my mother, Martha L. Burwell, who was born September 9, 1936. My mommie (her special spelling), fervently believed in every dream I ever had. My dream to go to Ghana was planted by my daddy, who raised each of his seven children to love and celebrate our African heritage.</p>
<p>My daddy, Arthur Burwell, Jr. aka Kofi Abogyse, travelled to Ghana in 1976, when I was eleven years old. During the late 70s, the mini-series Roots, sparked many Blacks to go in search of their African ancestry. My father was far from the exception. A culturally conscious man and community activist, his reasons for going to West Africa were to deepen his knowledge of our ancestry and make meaningful connections with the African people.</p>
<p>My dad brought back artifacts, games and stories. The greatest treasure was the life-long relationship he developed with a young man named, Justice. My father made it possible for Justice to move to America. Justice became a part of our family. Over the years, my father, Justice and I talked about me one day going to Ghana. As a teenager, it seemed a fanciful idea.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years later, when my father languished in bed, his body riddled with cancer, Justice was there grieving along with our entire family. It was at my dad’s bedside I pleaded with my dad to retell the stories he told me about Ghana. I longed to once more hear the story of how he stood in the hot Ghanaian sun to barter for artifacts, which now are in my home. Stories I heard so many times as a child (which honestly bored me), now in the final moments of my dad’s life, I begged to hear; but could not because cancer had stolen his voice.</p>
<p>As I grieved my father’s transition over the years, those treasures from Ghana have been a great source of comfort. The spears, the statues, the photos all make me smile knowing that each item gives me a small piece of my dad.</p>
<p>One day I got a postcard in the mail from a friend and fellow storyteller, Auntie JoJo. The postcard depicted the Wli Waterfall in Ghana, the highest natural waterfall on the west coast of Africa. I placed that postcard on my vision board to represent a quiet promise I made to myself to one day go to Ghana and walk where my father walked.</p>
<p>When I got the invitation from the NABS to perform at Panafest, my daughter immediately reminded me of my dream to one day go to Ghana. Her reminder made me look at that postcard on my vision board. I really made no conscious plan to manifest this dream; but the Divine helped me realize it nonetheless. My mind held some resistance, as I still had to figure out how to cover my expenses.</p>
<p>My next move was to apply for an Opportunity Grant with the Delaware Division of the Arts. The maximum award was $750, which only scratched the surface of what I needed. If I got the grant, I thought, it would be another indication that this trip will come to pass.</p>
<p>I got the grant!</p>
<p>Now I am only a few thousands dollars away from the goal! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Stories have paid the mortgage for nearly two decades. I am a professional storyteller, musician and vocalist. Sharing stories and songs rooted in the African  oral tradition has been my j-o-b since 1996. Now, I have an opportunity to perform in West Africa. 
The National Association of Black Storytellers Inc. (NABS) has invited me to perform at Panafest.  Additionally, I get to participate in the Inter-Continental Scholarly Exchange on the Preservation of the African Oral Tradition through Black Storytelling. Both the festival and scholarly exchange will take place in Ghana, West Africa December  1-19, 2015.
The stories and songs I perform are derived from both my personal experience as a woman of African descent, from the traditions handed down from my parents, as well as from my scholarly research. This project affords me an opportunity to go to the source of my cultural roots for the very first time and not only collect stories, but to participate in an academic discussion about African storytelling with a diverse assembly of people. 
Contributors to this project play a huge role! 
How the Money Will Be Used 
 The funds will go towards travel expenses to Ghana. Airfare, hotel, food and such. Thankfully, I received a $750 grant from the Delaware Divisions of the Arts, which reduced my expenses to just $3500. 


The Impact 
How This Project Impacts Me Personally
Storytime....
This crowd funding campaign is being launched on Sept. 9 in memory of my mother, Martha L. Burwell, who was born September 9, 1936. My mommie (her special spelling), fervently believed in every dream I ever had. My dream to go to Ghana was planted by my daddy, who raised each of his seven children to love and celebrate our African heritage.
My daddy, Arthur Burwell, Jr. aka Kofi Abogyse, travelled to Ghana in 1976, when I was eleven years old. During the late 70s, the mini-series Roots, sparked many Blacks to go in search of their African ancestry. My father was far from the exception. A culturally conscious man and community activist, his reasons for going to West Africa were to deepen his knowledge of our ancestry and make meaningful connections with the African people.
My dad brought back artifacts, games and stories. The greatest treasure was the life-long relationship he developed with a young man named, Justice. My father made it possible for Justice to move to America. Justice became a part of our family. Over the years, my father, Justice and I talked about me one day going to Ghana. As a teenager, it seemed a fanciful idea.
Twenty-one years later, when my father languished in bed, his body riddled with cancer, Justice was there grieving along with our entire family. It was at my dad’s bedside I pleaded with my dad to retell the stories he told me about Ghana. I longed to once more hear the story of how he stood in the hot Ghanaian sun to barter for artifacts, which now are in my home. Stories I heard so many times as a child (which honestly bored me), now in the final moments of my dad’s life, I begged to hear; but could not because cancer had stolen his voice.
As I grieved my father’s transition over the years, those treasures from Ghana have been a great source of comfort. The spears, the statues, the photos all make me smile knowing that each item gives me a small piece of my dad.
One day I got a postcard in the mail from a friend and fellow storyteller, Auntie JoJo. The postcard depicted the Wli Waterfall in Ghana, the highest natural waterfall on the west coast of Africa. I placed that postcard on my vision board to represent a quiet promise I made to myself to one day go to Ghana and walk where my father walked.
When I got the invitation from the NABS to perform at Panafest, my daughter immediately reminded me of my dream to one day go to Ghana. Her reminder made me look at that postcard on my vision board. I really made no conscious plan to manifest this dream; but the Divine helped me realize it nonetheless. My mind held some resistance, as I still had to figure out how to cover my expenses.
My next move was to apply for an Opportunity Grant with the Delaware Division of the Arts. The maximum award was $750, which only scratched the surface of what I needed. If I got the grant, I thought, it would be another indication that this trip will come to pass.
I got the grant!
Now I am only a few thousands dollars away from the goal!

<p>Hi everybody! My name is Liana Malva, I’m a singer and
songwriter from Venezuela, I grew up in an authentic family of artists in one
of the most exotic places of the world, El Pauji, La Gran Sabana, Venezuela.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing my own music since I was 11 years
old and I have been working in a personal project that started three years ago
along with my band. I make pop music with strong Black Music influences, and
mixing different genres is not only one of the things I love the most about
music, but it also defines me as an artist. Singing and writing music are my
biggest skills in life, and I can’t nor do I want to ever stop doing it. I am
always writing music and I dream of taking my project to the next level. I want
to record my first album to share all of this energy through good music.</p>
<p>My country is currently going through a very
complicated economic situation and the financial support to artists is
practically inexistent. There are no record labels investing in music, and in
general it is difficult to count on entities to support these kind of projects.
This is the reason why I decided to work on an independent production, with the
ad honorem support of an amazing group of professionals to be able to turn this
dream into a reality and take my music to an international field, which in
addition, raises the name and talent of my country. The possibility of
gathering the funds through a crowdfunding not only allows to manage the
project but it also gives us the possibility to share it closely with everyone,
with you.</p>
<p>There are two big pictures. If I didn’t make it to the
goal, I equally compromise to give the perks to all those who support me, in
addition to ensuring that the funds will be used to record independent singles
and/or to cover a national tour.</p>
<p>If there is something sure about this whole thing, is
that I won’t stop until I make it!</p>
<p>The other option and ideal big picture is that if we
complete the amount, we will also record the videoclip of the first single of
that first album, and this would only be possible with your participation and
help.</p>
<p>Life with good music is a celebration, so I invite you
to be a part of this party!</p>

</div></div>","About the 'Oh My...' music video
Hello! My name is Michael Pickard. I have a musical project called Bodhi's Wish with my bandmate Sean Tetarian and we are making our first music video for the track titled ""Oh My..."" off our upcoming EP. My good friend and New York based artist Tim Ballard will be doing the animation.  He has done fantastic work which you can see below. His background includes working on documentaries and music videos.
A little bit about the animation story. The narrative follows a lonely wanderer who we meet lost in a wasteland. In his journey he discovers new worlds and is helped by mysterious beings to bring life back to the dead land with dreams. It is about rebirth and rediscovering wonder, seeing magic and beauty in the world despite everything. It is about imagination and hope and dreaming new things for ourselves.

REWARDS
For all of you who donate $10.00, you will receive a digital download of the Bodhi's Wish track ""Oh My"".

</div><p></p><h1>Why A Song A Day matters</h1><p>No robot will ever be able to replace the music-obsessed friend saying “hey, I think you’ll really dig this track.” With the rise of so many music discovery resources, tools, and platforms, real, genuine and personalized music recommendations are hard to come by. </p><p>Even as a music lover, you're too busy to sort through all of the resources available today -- the sheer volume of options can be overwhelming. Algorithms are great, but they can get repetitive and rarely help you discover emerging or lesser-known artists. </p><p>We’re your music-obsessed friend sharing great songs and nerding out about music for you! We’re here to help you discover artists who will never get radio play or be featured on the front page of Spotify. We’re here to broaden your horizons and make you smile.</p><h1>Meet our music-obsessed curators</h1><p>We’re 44 (and growing) passionate music lovers spread across the globe. We’re artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, techsters, marketers, students, moms, dads and writers. The one thing we share in common is our love for music and passion for finding incredible artists and sharing them with others. We’ve been doing this for the majority of our lives and are beyond excited to have a captive audience. </p><p>With more than 440 people who have asked to be a curator, we're anxious to grow and scale this community to be something even more truly special than it already is.</p><p>Here’s a glimpse at who our curators are today:</p><div>

<li>A listener signs up; we listen to their favorite bands and learn about their interests</li>
<li>They're matched with a curator who listens to their preferences and selects songs</li>
<li>The curator inputs links, song data, and notes into Google sheets</li>
<li>Each email campaign is manually updated and scheduled </li>
<li>Listeners respond to the email with feedback, which is forwarded to their curator who reflect changes in their selections or reply to have a conversation about it</li>

<p><b>The future of A Song A Day</b></p>
<p>We're stoked to connect people over music, and we want to bring personalized music recommendations to everyone looking for a simple solution for discovering great music. However, we need to improve our process in order to grow our community of curators and listeners, and to deliver more personalized song picks. We need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p><b>Improvements to be made</b></p>
<p>We're asking for your support to help fund the development of a technical product that will allow us to offer a better musical experience by streamlining the song --&gt; email --&gt; listener --&gt; feedback process. It will also allow us to add some of the basic but important features our listeners have been asking for, such as:</p>

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/564/839/d1c73ac1b079d622ab5dfb9e87eb8acb_original.png?v=1443143507&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=5334a7b59b3be1a7e250207fe9578986"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>In the future: we’d like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your delivery time</li>
<li>A native player</li>
<li>Our own themed playlists</li>
<li>Special guest / influencer curators</li>
<li>Premium content</li>
<li>And so, so much more. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>**No matter how technological we get, all songs will always be hand-picked - and for now, every member will also be hand-matched to a curator.**</i></p>
<p>Your support will also help cover some of the overhead costs for running the project, including Mailchimp, hosting, databases, legal costs, etc. And the rewards of course. :) </p>
<p>Without the funding, we’ll likely have to scale back until we find another solution. In the long run, I’d love to find a technical partner who wants to build and grow A Song A Day with me. If you know of anyone who would be interested, holler at me!</p>

<h1>How it all started</h1>
<p>People have always asked me how I discover new music and I've happily given away my secrets, until one day I realized that few people were willing to make music discovery a routine like I had. They just wanted to know what they should listen to. With that, I decided to send my friends a song a day. </p>
<p>After buying the URL, creating a simple Squarespace, sending it to a few friends, and sleeping for a few hours, I tweeted it. Three hours later, it was trending on ProductHunt with 500 subscribers.</p>
<p>It turns out that my friends aren’t the only ones who want and need new music. With a ton of community support, the kindness of strangers, and unexpected Product Hunt success, it grew into a real and engaged community.</p>

<h1>Thank you!!</h1>

Algorithms are great, but they can get repetitive and rarely help you discover emerging or lesser-known artists. We’re your music-obsessed friend sharing great songs and nerding out about music for you! We’re here to help you discover artists who will never get radio play or be featured on the front page of Spotify. We’re here to broaden your horizons and make you smile.Meet our music-obsessed curatorsWe’re 44 (and growing) passionate music lovers spread across the globe. We’re artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, techsters, marketers, students, moms, dads and writers. The one thing we share in common is our love for music and passion for finding incredible artists and sharing them with others. We’ve been doing this for the majority of our lives and are beyond excited to have a captive audience. With more than 440 people who have asked to be a curator, we're anxious to grow and scale this community to be something even more truly special than it already is.Here’s a glimpse at who our curators are today:

How you can keep A Song A Day alive: why we need you
We're currently sending: 


To send these, our current process is insanely manual:

A listener signs up; we listen to their favorite bands and learn about their interests
They're matched with a curator who listens to their preferences and selects songs
The curator inputs links, song data, and notes into Google sheets
Each email campaign is manually updated and scheduled 
Listeners respond to the email with feedback, which is forwarded to their curator who reflect changes in their selections or reply to have a conversation about it
Not into your picks? Totally cool, we work with you to find a curator who’s a better fit

The emails sent look something like this: 


The future of A Song A Day
We're stoked to connect people over music, and we want to bring personalized music recommendations to everyone looking for a simple solution for discovering great music. However, we need to improve our process in order to grow our community of curators and listeners, and to deliver more personalized song picks. We need your help to make it happen.
Improvements to be made
We're asking for your support to help fund the development of a technical product that will allow us to offer a better musical experience by streamlining the song --> email --> listener --> feedback process. It will also allow us to add some of the basic but important features our listeners have been asking for, such as:


In the future: we’d like to add:

Choose your delivery time
A native player
Our own themed playlists
Special guest / influencer curators
Premium content
And so, so much more. 

**No matter how technological we get, all songs will always be hand-picked - and for now, every member will also be hand-matched to a curator.**
Your support will also help cover some of the overhead costs for running the project, including Mailchimp, hosting, databases, legal costs, etc. And the rewards of course. :) 
Without the funding, we’ll likely have to scale back until we find another solution. In the long run, I’d love to find a technical partner who wants to build and grow A Song A Day with me. If you know of anyone who would be interested, holler at me!

How to get involved
Sign up to receive your personalized, hand-picked songs or apply to become a curator. 
How it all started
People have always asked me how I discover new music and I've happily given away my secrets, until one day I realized that few people were willing to make music discovery a routine like I had. They just wanted to know what they should listen to. With that, I decided to send my friends a song a day. 
After buying the URL, creating a simple Squarespace, sending it to a few friends, and sleeping for a few hours, I tweeted it. Three hours later, it was trending on ProductHunt with 500 subscribers.
It turns out that my friends aren’t the only ones who want and need new music. With a ton of community support, the kindness of strangers, and unexpected Product Hunt success, it grew into a real and engaged community.

<b>Hello dear fans.  HEAD launched our full length ""concept"" album on Feb 20th and we would love your support.  We are a rock band from Vancouver Canada.  We are a 5 piece band that includes; Lyric- vocals, Stone - keys, oD - guitar, The Phantom - bass and Styxx - drums.  <br/></b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>We recorded an EP last year which stirred up interest... definitely got us noticed.  We had some great reviews on the 1st 6 songs.  Last July, we went back into The Warehouse and recorded the rest of the album.

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>""Afraid to Sleep"" is a concept album about a woman named Alberta. There are 17 tracks on this album that will take

</p>
<p>I am raising scholarship money for women to attend an extended weekend retreat: Making Peace with Your Inner Critic, July 8-11, 2016.</p>
<p>I have a critical voice inside my head that
can sometimes be a real beast. It's been there for as long as I can remember
and was probably a coping mechanism I developed growing up in my family's
particular brand of dysfunction. </p>
<p>Most women I know struggle with the same
critical voice. The critical voice of Not Enough. Not thin enough, pretty enough, smart enough, successful enough, etc. I
don’t know anyone who hasn’t struggled with the harsh voice of the inner
critic.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The thing is, many women do not have the financial means to
attend the weekend, but would really benefit from it. In 2014 I was able to
raise more than $1,700 of scholarship money on Indiegogo with your help. Because
many of you contributed in both large and small ways, several women were able
to attend that 2014 weekend who would not have been able to if not for your
support. It was a tremendous, healing gift to them. Here is just one woman’s
account of the difference you can make in a person’s life:</p>
<p>""The
weekend had a profound influence on my life in two ways. First it gave me
clarity, by quelling the fears and becoming aware of my unhealthy belief
systems, I came to understand, know, and BELIEVE IN what I needed to do for
myself. Second, it gave me the tools and strategy with which to take critical
tangible steps towards embracing the bountiful and joyous life that my 2 young
children and I deserve, NOW - not later! And lastly, truthfully, I could not
have done it without scholarship money provided by some anonymous donor, to
whom I am eternally grateful.""</p>
There are so many women out
there who struggle with the harsh voice of the inner critic. It robs them of
their joy and a life filled with passion and vitality. This retreat begins the
process of healing that wound. <br/>
<p>This weekend retreat creates a safe place for women to bring ALL of who
they are, the beautiful <i>and </i>the not-beautiful aspects of self. Here women will
explore, discover, connect, create, and heal. Together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>During this healing retreat, women:</span></p>
<ul><li><p>Gain insight around what to do with the demons of comparison, scarcity, and shame, and why not caring what other people think is its own kind of hustle.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Understand why stronger armor is not the answer and how ""armoring-up"" can actually get in the way of what you want.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Learn concrete actions/behaviors that you can practice for continued positive results.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Explore what it means to show up and be seen.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Become the person who believes in herself and shows up for herself with courage and compassion.</p></li></ul>
</div><div>Retreat website link: <a href=""http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/#!2016-retreat/zd8o8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sagesoulsisters.com/#!2016-retreat/zd8o8</a>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><b>What Participants Say:</b></p>
<p>""My time spent in retreat contributed in a meaningful way to my ongoing personal growth and transformation.Since attending the retreat, I have strengthened my voice as a powerful female artist, creating work that pursues social justice and equity for marginalized individuals.As a woman who constantly cares for the needs of others, it was critical that I take the time to care for myself, and the Sage Soul Sisters Retreat was exactly what I needed to recharge and grow."" ~A. Marten</p>
<p><span>""I am very grateful for the opportunity provided to experience some ground-breaking healing.  I feel like my life is moving forward in a very positive way, and it's the peace I feel that urges me forward."" L. Whidby</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>""The retreat really offered an opportunity to be seen and
heard with no judgment amongst <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">beautiful and empowering souls, all of whom were seeking to manifest
and create a deepened understanding of self and their relationships. I left
feeling rejuvenated and really appreciative of the experience all round."" G. Polak</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was able to express a rare and heartfelt playfulness!  I also experienced the joy of finally accepting and loving my physical body."" L. Greiss</span></p>
<p></p>
</div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have kept the prices as low as I
possibly can to make this retreat available for more women. Even so, there are many women who really need this, but do not have the financial means to participate. I truly believe in this kind of exploration, connection,  and sharing. I believe in it passionately, because I have seen the healing and profound change it can make in a woman's life. </p>
<p>In 2014, I raised just over $1,700 with Indiegogo for another women's retreat called Women's Body Wisdom; Honoring Our Bodies as an Exquisite Resource. It was an extraordinary weekend. This year I am asking for the same. I believe with your help, we can reach that goal again. </p>
<p>Money raised will be divided into scholarships for women in need. Your contributions help
with registration cost and travel expenses. For many, this can be a
life-changing experience. Please show your support with a financial
contribution to help us reach our goal. Any and all contributions are
appreciated and help us move closer to our goal. Please share on your social
media pages so we can get the word out there. </p>
<p>You can
make a significant difference in a woman’s life.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Cost Breakdown Comparison</b></p>
<p>To give you an idea of what a weekend getaway costs in this area, I did a little online research on cost of accommodations, meals, and creative workshops costs and fees. I wanted to compare what it would cost if you took a weekend getaway on your own and combined it with the individual workshops. The breakdown is below:</p>
<p>I took the cost of 10 different hotels in Asheville, NC and got an average rate of approximately $85 per night for a hotel X 3 nights = $255</p>
<p>Restaurants ranging from $-$$</p>
<p>$ Restaurant:    Breakfast about $15 includes tip</p>
<p>                        Lunch (same as breakfast)</p>
<p>$$ Restaurant:  Dinner $35 includes tip</p>
<p>3 dinners = $105, 3 breakfast = $45, 2 lunch = $45 = $195 total meals</p>
<p>Art workshop average workshop fee $99 + materials fee $25 = $124</p>
<p>Exploration and self-discovery workshop fee (7 sessions) $200 + $25 materials fee = $225</p>
<p><b>So here is what that came to:</b></p>
<p>$225 accommodations (3 nights)</p>
<p>$195 (8 meals)</p>
<p>$124 Art workshop (2 ½ hour session)</p>
<p>$225 Primary workshop (7 sessions)</p>
<p>______________________________________</p>
<p>$769 Total for a comparable weekend in the Asheville, NC area.</p>
<p><b>$610 for the entire weekend (all-inclusive) <b>Making Peace with Your Inner Critic </b></b></p>

<div>The retreat will be held at Bend of Ivy Lodge just outside of Asheville, NC. Bend of ivy is a beautiful, tranquil place where a woman can have solitude and time to tend to herself.

I love this pic. People often comment on it. What most don't know is that this pic was taken the day my mom died. I was in Miami with my four sisters and my brother. We had gathered to send her off. She had leukemia, and we knew this was the final goodbye for all of us. In the photograph my face holds all the joy of a life celebrated and grief for the woman I will always miss. I share this because my mother is a big reason I do women's soul work. In a way, this work is my tribute to her and her crazy, unabashed, creative self<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. She had a <i>brutal</i> inner critic, and I mean <i>brutal</i>.<i> </i>I don't think that even on her death bed she had any idea of her own worth and value. She had her faults, no argument. But she was also creative, fun-loving, rebellious, wildly expressive, a passionate rule-breaker, a feminist, and a big dog lover. She loved people, too. All kinds. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>
</div>Inspired by the women who have gone before me, including my banner carrying (literally) feminist mother and aunt, I design and facilitate creative workshops, retreats, and ritual celebrations for women. I, like my mother before me, have struggled with knowing my own worth and value, with knowing how to respond to myself with compassion and tenderness. It grieves me that so many women wrestle with this same thing. My goal is to love myself <i>fiercely</i>, and to inspire other women to do the same. It is my mission to create an emotionally safe space for women to bring all of who they are, both the beautiful and the not-beautiful aspects of self. In this safe space, a woman can reconnect with her body as an exquisite resource rather than a source of shame. Our body houses our instinct and intuition, our voice, our true north. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>It is a vision of mine to have a healing retreat center where I can combine my passion for women's soul work with creative expression.

I am raising scholarship money for women to attend an extended weekend retreat: Making Peace with Your Inner Critic, July 8-11, 2016.
I have a critical voice inside my head that
can sometimes be a real beast. It's been there for as long as I can remember
and was probably a coping mechanism I developed growing up in my family's
particular brand of dysfunction. 
Most women I know struggle with the same
critical voice. The critical voice of Not Enough. Not thin enough, pretty enough, smart enough, successful enough, etc. I
don’t know anyone who hasn’t struggled with the harsh voice of the inner
critic.


The thing is, many women do not have the financial means to
attend the weekend, but would really benefit from it. In 2014 I was able to
raise more than $1,700 of scholarship money on Indiegogo with your help. Because
many of you contributed in both large and small ways, several women were able
to attend that 2014 weekend who would not have been able to if not for your
support. It was a tremendous, healing gift to them. Here is just one woman’s
account of the difference you can make in a person’s life:
""The
weekend had a profound influence on my life in two ways. First it gave me
clarity, by quelling the fears and becoming aware of my unhealthy belief
systems, I came to understand, know, and BELIEVE IN what I needed to do for
myself. Second, it gave me the tools and strategy with which to take critical
tangible steps towards embracing the bountiful and joyous life that my 2 young
children and I deserve, NOW - not later! And lastly, truthfully, I could not
have done it without scholarship money provided by some anonymous donor, to
whom I am eternally grateful.""
There are so many women out
there who struggle with the harsh voice of the inner critic. It robs them of
their joy and a life filled with passion and vitality. This retreat begins the
process of healing that wound. 
This weekend retreat creates a safe place for women to bring ALL of who
they are, the beautiful and the not-beautiful aspects of self. Here women will
explore, discover, connect, create, and heal. Together. 

During this healing retreat, women:
Gain insight around what to do with the demons of comparison, scarcity, and shame, and why not caring what other people think is its own kind of hustle.
Understand why stronger armor is not the answer and how ""armoring-up"" can actually get in the way of what you want.
Learn concrete actions/behaviors that you can practice for continued positive results.
Explore what it means to show up and be seen.
Become the person who believes in herself and shows up for herself with courage and compassion.

What Participants Say:
""My time spent in retreat contributed in a meaningful way to my ongoing personal growth and transformation.Since attending the retreat, I have strengthened my voice as a powerful female artist, creating work that pursues social justice and equity for marginalized individuals.As a woman who constantly cares for the needs of others, it was critical that I take the time to care for myself, and the Sage Soul Sisters Retreat was exactly what I needed to recharge and grow."" ~A. Marten
""I am very grateful for the opportunity provided to experience some ground-breaking healing.  I feel like my life is moving forward in a very positive way, and it's the peace I feel that urges me forward."" L. Whidby

""The retreat really offered an opportunity to be seen and
heard with no judgment amongst beautiful and empowering souls, all of whom were seeking to manifest
and create a deepened understanding of self and their relationships. I left
feeling rejuvenated and really appreciative of the experience all round."" G. Polak
""I was able to express a rare and heartfelt playfulness!  I also experienced the joy of finally accepting and loving my physical body."" L. Greiss

What We Need & What You Get


I have kept the prices as low as I
possibly can to make this retreat available for more women. Even so, there are many women who really need this, but do not have the financial means to participate. I truly believe in this kind of exploration, connection,  and sharing. I believe in it passionately, because I have seen the healing and profound change it can make in a woman's life. 
In 2014, I raised just over $1,700 with Indiegogo for another women's retreat called Women's Body Wisdom; Honoring Our Bodies as an Exquisite Resource. It was an extraordinary weekend. This year I am asking for the same. I believe with your help, we can reach that goal again. 
Money raised will be divided into scholarships for women in need. Your contributions help
with registration cost and travel expenses. For many, this can be a
life-changing experience. Please show your support with a financial
contribution to help us reach our goal. Any and all contributions are
appreciated and help us move closer to our goal. Please share on your social
media pages so we can get the word out there. 
You can
make a significant difference in a woman’s life.

Cost Breakdown Comparison
To give you an idea of what a weekend getaway costs in this area, I did a little online research on cost of accommodations, meals, and creative workshops costs and fees. I wanted to compare what it would cost if you took a weekend getaway on your own and combined it with the individual workshops. The breakdown is below:
I took the cost of 10 different hotels in Asheville, NC and got an average rate of approximately $85 per night for a hotel X 3 nights = $255
Restaurants ranging from $-$$
$ Restaurant:    Breakfast about $15 includes tip
                        Lunch (same as breakfast)
$$ Restaurant:  Dinner $35 includes tip
3 dinners = $105, 3 breakfast = $45, 2 lunch = $45 = $195 total meals
Art workshop average workshop fee $99 + materials fee $25 = $124
Exploration and self-discovery workshop fee (7 sessions) $200 + $25 materials fee = $225
So here is what that came to:
$225 accommodations (3 nights)
$195 (8 meals)
$124 Art workshop (2 ½ hour session)
$225 Primary workshop (7 sessions)
______________________________________
$769 Total for a comparable weekend in the Asheville, NC area.
$610 for the entire weekend (all-inclusive) Making Peace with Your Inner Critic 

The Venue 

The retreat will be held at Bend of Ivy Lodge just outside of Asheville, NC. Bend of ivy is a beautiful, tranquil place where a woman can have solitude and time to tend to herself. Unlike large conference centers, Bend of Ivy is cocooned on private property in the Blue Ridge Mountains. There are 63 acres to explore of trails, rivers, ponds, a labyrinth, and zen-like sitting areas. All meals, accommodations, art materials and workshop supplies are included in the registration price. Check out more at www.bendofivylodge.com

  Who Am I?
That's me. I love this pic. People often comment on it. What most don't know is that this pic was taken the day my mom died. I was in Miami with my four sisters and my brother. We had gathered to send her off. She had leukemia, and we knew this was the final goodbye for all of us. In the photograph my face holds all the joy of a life celebrated and grief for the woman I will always miss. I share this because my mother is a big reason I do women's soul work. In a way, this work is my tribute to her and her crazy, unabashed, creative self. She had a brutal inner critic, and I mean brutal. I don't think that even on her death bed she had any idea of her own worth and value. She had her faults, no argument. But she was also creative, fun-loving, rebellious, wildly expressive, a passionate rule-breaker, a feminist, and a big dog lover. She loved people, too. All kinds.  
Inspired by the women who have gone before me, including my banner carrying (literally) feminist mother and aunt, I design and facilitate creative workshops, retreats, and ritual celebrations for women. I, like my mother before me, have struggled with knowing my own worth and value, with knowing how to respond to myself with compassion and tenderness. It grieves me that so many women wrestle with this same thing. My goal is to love myself fiercely, and to inspire other women to do the same. It is my mission to create an emotionally safe space for women to bring all of who they are, both the beautiful and the not-beautiful aspects of self. In this safe space, a woman can reconnect with her body as an exquisite resource rather than a source of shame. Our body houses our instinct and intuition, our voice, our true north. It is a vision of mine to have a healing retreat center where I can combine my passion for women's soul work with creative expression. At present, I teach elementary art in the public school system and I live with my soulmate and husband, Michael Harper, and our two dogs.Please visit my website www.sagesoulsisters.com",3.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<b>First,</b> we would like to create awareness for this new expression of the crossover between music, and the movement of our daily life. This is what we like to call the <b>Soundtrack to Your Life</b>. We chose to go the <b>indie</b> way and not to succumb to raising the funds we needed via <b>VC</b> as is customary. We want to create a community of people who appreciate how creative this can be, and to be able to raise enough funds together to get <b>AirFlow</b> where it needs to go, so that everyone can enjoy making music with it. We want people who share our vision and love music as much as we do. Come and be part of something amazing and innovative!

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><ul><li><b>Do I need any musical experience? </b></li></ul>
<p>You need absolutely no experience to use <b>AirFlow</b>, just a passion for music, creativity and an Android or iOS device. We believe prerequisite musical knowledge excludes too many users and doesn't give them a voice or an opportunity to create.</p>
<ul><li><b>Will anyone be able to use it?  </b></li></ul>
<p>Yes, that is exactly the idea.We are looking to create a community based on creativity, fun, motion and simplicity. We believe that music as it stands today excludes a lot of people that perhaps don't have the musical background but may be amazingly creative and could make beautiful tracks, We believe in being a <b>global</b> platform that unites our users and provides them with the tools they need.</p>
<ul><li><b>What is Airflow?</b></li></ul>
<p><b>AirFlow </b>is the first smartphone application of its kind. It offers its users the opportunity to create music using their body movements while holding their device. There is a number of pre-set movements built into the system and an instrument or a beat is attributed to each of them. Then you begin composing your track by moving, and you see where it takes you as you create it. It is a new way to look at our devices. We carry them all day long, they have become and indispensable part of our lives and we thought ""why not explore this extra dimension?."" They go where we go. They move how we move. <b>AirFlow was born</b>.</p>
<ul><li><b> How does it work? </b></li></ul>
<div>We decided  upon a set of <b>5 movements</b> that we use instinctively when we have our phones with us. With the pre-set movements, you choose the instruments and beats you wish to use from within our <b>Library</b>, by simply drag-and-dropping them in the designated track box. You have access to a second set of 5 tracks with the same movements if you want to use more than 5 layers. You set the <b>Tempo</b>, the <b>Bar</b>, and you can use the <b>Click</b> feature as well, which is a metronome.Then, you can use <b>Practice Mode or record in Live Mode</b>. When you are done, you can <b>Save, Share, or Edit</b> the track into a full song using our Premium features. You will also be able to create a profile with friends, upload your own videos, and sell your music, as well as purchase the music of your friends and network. You can team up with up to 10 friends, with each one acting as if they were one beat or instrument, and create one track together. We will choose amazing videos and songs and upload them to our <b>Youtube Channel </b>as well.</div>

<b>Why are you raising funds?</b>
</li></ul></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
In a world of <b>Venture Capital</b>, as much as we appreciate how mainstream fundraising goes, we love <b>Indiegogo</b> and how it gives the people a voice in terms of what they like. There is no better way to get honest feedback, and to create awareness and support. The fundraising part is just one of the aspects that we love with Crowdfunding, and we are thankful that we have platforms that we may do this on in this day in age.</span>

Everything today is moving towards a sensor-based interface with our mobile devices and hardware in general, like PCs and consoles (Kinect, Oculus Rift, Primesense). The next logical step is to be able to extract musical segments from the intuitive motions of a user, in a single and fluid movement sequence. AirFlow offers anyone this possibility without having to be a professional musician.                                                                                                                                                                                   We bring you the first Smartphone App for Music Creation based on body movement. You use the everyday motion from your body to create musical beats and songs using AirFlow, with many features to enrich the experience even more.The idea to is be as intuitive as possible. We live in a world of movement and action. This is energy that we create on a daily basis, so why not put it to good use? AirFlow combines a fun and light interface with the creative experience of making music, either by yourself or with a group of friends simultaneously, along with aesthetics of the highest level.                                                                                                        The AirFlow Team is passionate about sensor-based interaction with our smartphones. We see the potential this has, as we are just touching the surface. We want to be part of this and show the world that it can be creative, fun and active at the same time. We need your support and contributions to get there and we are counting on all the creative people out there to help us reach our goal, so that we can make this a reality. We provide the tools.

First, we would like to create awareness for this new expression of the crossover between music, and the movement of our daily life. This is what we like to call the Soundtrack to Your Life. We chose to go the indie way and not to succumb to raising the funds we needed via VC as is customary. We want to create a community of people who appreciate how creative this can be, and to be able to raise enough funds together to get AirFlow where it needs to go, so that everyone can enjoy making music with it. We want people who share our vision and love music as much as we do. Come and be part of something amazing and innovative! Visit us on Social Media and at our website www.airflowtheapp.com.

It translates different body movements into different tracks, enabling you to  create a song by moving with your smartphone, even dancing. It uses the sensors already built into the mobile device to give the user an opportunity to create a beat or a full song using a pre-determined, very simple sequence of movements.     
                            
                                                                                                                        


You choose a Beat mode that characterizes your mood and what you want to create. Under that category, you drag and drop different beats and instruments from the available Library into the designated slots. Each slot has a specific movement attributed to it. Like this, you choose which beats will be associated with which movement. You follow by setting the Tempo, and the Bar (the measure). These help you with the speed and timing of your creation. You also have the Click button, which is a simple Metronome.Then, you start moving in Live or Practice mode, and you can witness the outcome in real-time, and view the amazing AudioVisual Rendition afterwards.                    


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Beat Creation with your Body Movement

The development includes our Web-based content, with the AirFlow community Network, its user profiles, their management, beat libraries and their creation, and the ability to buy and sell each other's beats and tracks. Also included are our future plugins and our GroupCreate Feature. We are developing new technology and exploring a new dimension of what we can extract from our smartphones. The development includes all musical aspects as well as labor that will need be external to our team. Collectively, the funds we are seeking will enable our team to take the AirFlow to launch on iOS and Android, and will cover our Marketing campaign and Promotion for the months leading to launch and afterwards. Thirdly, it will cover our maintenance, hosting, and other technical aspects for the first 6 months, and enable our team to pursue some further development ideas. Lastly, it will help with some of our business and legal expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
         



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            












  

  We welcome the challenges associated with AirFlow with open arms as they are part of the birth of our product. The main obstacles we will face and overcome are:    


                                                                                                                     1. Synchronizing the beat, the audio and the audiovisual rendering with no delay on Android and iOS.            


2.The GroupCreate feature engaging 10 people in the creation of one beat, totally synchronized in real-time.   


3. Constantly creating new content to keep our community of users engaged and happy, with new beat libraries and innovative plugins.  


4.The new exploration of wrist and arm powered movement interfacing with a smartphone. We love to see what AirFlow will bring in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

              




Do I need any musical experience? 
You need absolutely no experience to use AirFlow, just a passion for music, creativity and an Android or iOS device. We believe prerequisite musical knowledge excludes too many users and doesn't give them a voice or an opportunity to create.
Will anyone be able to use it?  
Yes, that is exactly the idea.We are looking to create a community based on creativity, fun, motion and simplicity. We believe that music as it stands today excludes a lot of people that perhaps don't have the musical background but may be amazingly creative and could make beautiful tracks, We believe in being a global platform that unites our users and provides them with the tools they need.
What is Airflow?
AirFlow is the first smartphone application of its kind. It offers its users the opportunity to create music using their body movements while holding their device. There is a number of pre-set movements built into the system and an instrument or a beat is attributed to each of them. Then you begin composing your track by moving, and you see where it takes you as you create it. It is a new way to look at our devices. We carry them all day long, they have become and indispensable part of our lives and we thought ""why not explore this extra dimension?."" They go where we go. They move how we move. AirFlow was born.
 How does it work? 
We decided  upon a set of 5 movements that we use instinctively when we have our phones with us. With the pre-set movements, you choose the instruments and beats you wish to use from within our Library, by simply drag-and-dropping them in the designated track box. You have access to a second set of 5 tracks with the same movements if you want to use more than 5 layers. You set the Tempo, the Bar, and you can use the Click feature as well, which is a metronome.Then, you can use Practice Mode or record in Live Mode. When you are done, you can Save, Share, or Edit the track into a full song using our Premium features. You will also be able to create a profile with friends, upload your own videos, and sell your music, as well as purchase the music of your friends and network. You can team up with up to 10 friends, with each one acting as if they were one beat or instrument, and create one track together. We will choose amazing videos and songs and upload them to our Youtube Channel as well.

Why are you raising funds?

In a world of Venture Capital, as much as we appreciate how mainstream fundraising goes, we love Indiegogo and how it gives the people a voice in terms of what they like. There is no better way to get honest feedback, and to create awareness and support. The fundraising part is just one of the aspects that we love with Crowdfunding, and we are thankful that we have platforms that we may do this on in this day in age.

Firstly, thank you for taking time to look at my campaign!  Every view and share truly means a lot to me.
Music is a big part of who I am.  Music has the power to accompany us through life's ups and downs, console us, and rejoice with us.  The songs on this album have mostly been written over the past six years and have been influenced by soul, rock, pop and reggae.  They are a part of my story, and a part of me.  My heart, soul, mind, work and money have gone into this project.

<div>From the start, our mission was to promote the underground music, in all its fullness - and i am talking about the young producers, DJ's, writers, composers etc. </div> <p>We turn our attention to the most representative styles of global dance music, like House, Deep House, Techno, Drum&amp;Bass, Trance, Progressive, Future House, and many more. We do it with love, from the heart and with the confidence that we could give a helping hand to all those who believe like any beginning is difficult. Because they have right. In our turn we were helped, and now everything goes well, we do well and we love what we are doing. But now we need you to give us a hand to make another big step: get out of the dark, and find a place near the grands!<br/></p>
<p>We are a great team - people involved with their works, passion and love for the global dance movement. And we want more. We want to be in the middle of what is called the world's cultural core, and therefore we have decided to move in UK.</p>
<p>We have ensured the broadcasting studio location there, but we need more funds to move itself, and properly equipping a little bit more this studio. For us it is very important your help. Think that will actually contribute to the realization of a dream that once achieved, will help fulfill the dreams of others.

<p>The Ritratti Project is a crowdfunding campaign, the object of which is to <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">present musical and artistic ‘Portraits’ on an album and in crossover productions around the world, thereby taking this wonderful music to a wider audience. In order to do that we need to raise the $7000 necessary to record the Ritratti Album and cover the flight costs of the Ritratti Tour.</span></p>
<p>Ritratti is not only the pianist <b>Cristina Cavalli. </b>There are other portraits and other faces are involved: <b>Alessandro Mercurio</b>, director, scriptwriter &amp; actor in Canada, <b>Ursula Caporali</b>, pianist and composer in Australia, and <b>Michelana Lam</b>,<b> </b>university music professor in Hong Kong.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455016606/dguipjuwnm6ouzyshdw2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In each place the musical portraits will change their shape: in Montreal they'll interact with voices and images thanks to Alessandro; in Sydney they will assume a <i>Dotted Face </i>thanks to Ursula, who put in her composition sounds and other elements coming from the Aboriginal tradition; in Australia <i>Ritratti</i> will also become a real portrait on a canvas thanks to painting. In Hong Kong, hopefully all together (if the amount raised is enough), we'll give life to all the faces at a time.</p>
<h3>What makes the difference</h3>
<p>There are plenty of recording projects, many of them really worthy, but Ritratti aims to be something more: a project with several people involved, which connects music to other arts and joins the idea of a multidisciplinary collaboration, an idea which is, in our opinion, a great resource for the future. Also, this way we are allowed to take with us on the way friends, colleagues, and all the wonderful persons who appreciate courage, effort and… maybe a bit of boldness.</p>

<h3>What music and why?</h3>
<p><i>Ritratti</i> means ""portraits"" in Italian and our project is all about the idea of the portrait in music in the XX and XXI centuries...  in a way, contemporary portraits! Because all <i>old </i>music has been <i>new</i> music once.</p>

<p>                                                    Four American preludes: <br/>                                                       - Tribute to Roberto Garcia Morillo <br/>                                                       - Tribute to Juan José Castro <br/>                                                       - Tribute to Aaron Copland <br/>                                                       - Tribute to Heitor Villa-Lobos </p>

<h1>Ritratti Project</h1>
<div>
<p>Ritratti project è la campagna di crowdfunding che si ripropone di presentare ritratti musicali e artistici in un album (CD) e in produzioni crossover in giro per il mondo, portando questa musica meravigliosa a un pubblico più vasto. Per fare questo ci servono 7.000 $ per registrare l’album Ritratti e coprire i costi di viaggio del Ritratti Tour.</p>
<p>Ritratti non è solo il pianoforte di <b>Cristina Cavalli</b>: altri ritratti, altri volti sono coinvolti: <b>Alessandro Mercurio</b>, regista, attore e sceneggiatore in Canada, <b>Ursula Caporali</b>, compositrice e pianista in Australia, e <b>Michelana Lam</b>, professoressa all'Università di Hong Kong.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456174922/r16jo5g56cb0zdphw0ea.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In ogni luogo i ritratti musicali cambieranno forma: a Montreal interagiranno con le voci e le immagini grazie ad Alessandro; a Sydney diventeranno una <i>Dotted Face (volto a punti) </i>grazie ad Ursula, che ha inserito nella sua composizione elementi presi dalla tradizione locale aborigena; in Australia <i>Ritratti</i> diventerà anche un ritratto vero e proprio grazie alla pittura. A Hong Kong infine, speriamo tutti insieme (se la cifra raccolta sarà sufficiente) di dar vita a questi volti multiformi in una unica produzione. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Cosa fa la differenza</h3>
<p>Ci sono migliaia di album in fase di produzione, molti di questi davvero belli, ma <i>Ritratti</i> vuol essere qualcosa di diverso, qualcosa di più: un progetto con più persone coinvolte,  che unisce la musica ad altre arti e propone l’idea della collaborazione interdisciplinare, idea in cui secondo noi ci sono risorse importanti per il nostro futuro. E poi produrre così ci dà la possibilità di portare con noi lungo il percorso tutte quelle persone che vorranno esserne parte, condividendo con noi coraggio, sforzi e… anche un pizzico di audacia.</p>

<h1>Ritratti (retratos) Project</h1>
<div>
<p>Ritratti Project es una campaña crowdfunding que quiere presentar retratos musicales y artísticos en un Album de Piano y en producciones crossover alrededor del mundo, llevando esta música maravillosa a un público más grande. Para hacer eso necesitamos 7.000 $ para grabar el album Ritratti y cobrir los gastos de viaje para el Ritratti Tour.</p>
<p><i>Ritratti</i> no es solo el Piano de <b>Cristina Cavalli</b>: otros retratos, otras caras son involucradas: <b>Alessandro Mercurio</b>, director, actor y guionista en Canada, <b>Ursula Caporali</b>, compositora y pianista en Australia, y <b>Michelana Lam</b>, profesora a la Universidad de Hong Kong.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456181895/qlfelkoq7k4hcn35munf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>En cada sitio los retratos cambiarán de forma: en Montreal juntándose con las voces y las imagenes gracias a Alessandro, en Sydney cogerán forma de <i>Dotted Face (cara a puntos) </i>gracias a Ursula, que puso en su composición algunos elementos de la tradición aborigena; en Australia <i>Ritratti</i> encontrará también colores y lienzo gracias a la pintura. En Hong Kong, esperamos todos juntos (si la cifra recogida será suficiente) daremos vida a todos estos retratos a la vez.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>¿Qué hace la diferencia?</h3>
<p>Hay cientos de proyectos de grabación, muchos de los cuales valorables, pero Ritratti se propone como algo más: un proyecto que involucra a más personas, que une la música con las otras artes y se fija en la idea de la colaboración interdisciplinar, una idea que creemos ser un gran recurso para nuestro futuro. Además, trabajar así nos permite llevar con nosotros en el recorrido todas las personas que nos apoyarán y comparten con nosotros coraje, esfuerzos y… un poco de audacia.</p>

Click aquí para Español Ritratti (portraits) Project
The Ritratti Project is a crowdfunding campaign, the object of which is to present musical and artistic ‘Portraits’ on an album and in crossover productions around the world, thereby taking this wonderful music to a wider audience. In order to do that we need to raise the $7000 necessary to record the Ritratti Album and cover the flight costs of the Ritratti Tour.
Ritratti is not only the pianist Cristina Cavalli. There are other portraits and other faces are involved: Alessandro Mercurio, director, scriptwriter & actor in Canada, Ursula Caporali, pianist and composer in Australia, and Michelana Lam, university music professor in Hong Kong.




In each place the musical portraits will change their shape: in Montreal they'll interact with voices and images thanks to Alessandro; in Sydney they will assume a Dotted Face thanks to Ursula, who put in her composition sounds and other elements coming from the Aboriginal tradition; in Australia Ritratti will also become a real portrait on a canvas thanks to painting. In Hong Kong, hopefully all together (if the amount raised is enough), we'll give life to all the faces at a time.
What makes the difference
There are plenty of recording projects, many of them really worthy, but Ritratti aims to be something more: a project with several people involved, which connects music to other arts and joins the idea of a multidisciplinary collaboration, an idea which is, in our opinion, a great resource for the future. Also, this way we are allowed to take with us on the way friends, colleagues, and all the wonderful persons who appreciate courage, effort and… maybe a bit of boldness.

Ritratti Project

Ritratti project è la campagna di crowdfunding che si ripropone di presentare ritratti musicali e artistici in un album (CD) e in produzioni crossover in giro per il mondo, portando questa musica meravigliosa a un pubblico più vasto. Per fare questo ci servono 7.000 $ per registrare l’album Ritratti e coprire i costi di viaggio del Ritratti Tour.
Ritratti non è solo il pianoforte di Cristina Cavalli: altri ritratti, altri volti sono coinvolti: Alessandro Mercurio, regista, attore e sceneggiatore in Canada, Ursula Caporali, compositrice e pianista in Australia, e Michelana Lam, professoressa all'Università di Hong Kong.



In ogni luogo i ritratti musicali cambieranno forma: a Montreal interagiranno con le voci e le immagini grazie ad Alessandro; a Sydney diventeranno una Dotted Face (volto a punti) grazie ad Ursula, che ha inserito nella sua composizione elementi presi dalla tradizione locale aborigena; in Australia Ritratti diventerà anche un ritratto vero e proprio grazie alla pittura. A Hong Kong infine, speriamo tutti insieme (se la cifra raccolta sarà sufficiente) di dar vita a questi volti multiformi in una unica produzione. 

Cosa fa la differenza
Ci sono migliaia di album in fase di produzione, molti di questi davvero belli, ma Ritratti vuol essere qualcosa di diverso, qualcosa di più: un progetto con più persone coinvolte,  che unisce la musica ad altre arti e propone l’idea della collaborazione interdisciplinare, idea in cui secondo noi ci sono risorse importanti per il nostro futuro. E poi produrre così ci dà la possibilità di portare con noi lungo il percorso tutte quelle persone che vorranno esserne parte, condividendo con noi coraggio, sforzi e… anche un pizzico di audacia.

Ritratti (retratos) Project

Ritratti Project es una campaña crowdfunding que quiere presentar retratos musicales y artísticos en un Album de Piano y en producciones crossover alrededor del mundo, llevando esta música maravillosa a un público más grande. Para hacer eso necesitamos 7.000 $ para grabar el album Ritratti y cobrir los gastos de viaje para el Ritratti Tour.
Ritratti no es solo el Piano de Cristina Cavalli: otros retratos, otras caras son involucradas: Alessandro Mercurio, director, actor y guionista en Canada, Ursula Caporali, compositora y pianista en Australia, y Michelana Lam, profesora a la Universidad de Hong Kong.



En cada sitio los retratos cambiarán de forma: en Montreal juntándose con las voces y las imagenes gracias a Alessandro, en Sydney cogerán forma de Dotted Face (cara a puntos) gracias a Ursula, que puso en su composición algunos elementos de la tradición aborigena; en Australia Ritratti encontrará también colores y lienzo gracias a la pintura. En Hong Kong, esperamos todos juntos (si la cifra recogida será suficiente) daremos vida a todos estos retratos a la vez.

¿Qué hace la diferencia?
Hay cientos de proyectos de grabación, muchos de los cuales valorables, pero Ritratti se propone como algo más: un proyecto que involucra a más personas, que une la música con las otras artes y se fija en la idea de la colaboración interdisciplinar, una idea que creemos ser un gran recurso para nuestro futuro. Además, trabajar así nos permite llevar con nosotros en el recorrido todas las personas que nos apoyarán y comparten con nosotros coraje, esfuerzos y… un poco de audacia.

To deliver the frequency of love to the world out there, to be heard, to inspire, and to make a difference ...You will also make a difference by helping the Fondation of the association HaitiCosmos : FondationCosmos, which works for the education and health in Haiti. The rhythm of your life, the rhythm of your thought, let us write together this beautiful story "" Present Moment "" My goal for this project is to ""GIVE""...                                                                ***                                                                                       Pic © Plein Feux FestivalWho I am and What makes me want to get in touch with you ?My name is Ted Beaubrun, and I am a drummer, singer, songwriter, producer, dad, husband and good friend!
I drew my strength from the public’s show of faith and their enthusiastic reception of my first ‘Voodoo Pop’ album “Lâcher prise”, (Letting go), released in 2014. To continue to resonate with the public, I plan to go back in the studio in March 2016, to record my second album “Moment présent “(Present Moment). And I'd love for you to be part of this new project.
                                                                          ***
   ""Moment présent"", the new ALBUM""Moment
présent"" aims to be even more
authentic, both in the exploration of my cultural rhythms my voodoo culture and
my connected to pop music. It will consist of 12 tracks that illustrate the new
knowledge, human and spiritual experiences that have marked my daily life as an
artist. Through ""Moment présent"" all while respecting a universal musical approach, I will keep the magic punctuated by Haitian goatskin drums, traditional instruments. I will have the honor of working and arranging with my father, Theodore ""Lolo"" Beaubrun , a founding member of Boukman Eksperyans in tribute to the rich and valuable heritage I inherited. 


                 Pèpè Yè -Boukman Eksperyans - Prod. by Ted Beaubrun


What I Need and What You Get

$15,000 => Recording studio (Sound recording + mixing)
$ 3,000 => Mastering
$ 2,000 => Professional Graphics (Graphics CD cover)

Music is variety of genre range from avant-garde and experimental music through minimalism and post-minimalism; from mysticism to jazz and film music. The acoustic soundscape encounters piano, toy piano, music box, soundtracks, computer software and vocal narrative.<br/><br/>Between May and August 2014, I played a series of three concerts under the joint title “My Little Concert Anthology of Piano Music.” This project was nominated for the Belgrade City Award. Collection was conceived around compositions that I had previously played or wanted to play; and then, in the process of searching for something new, it turned into three progra<a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>ms that I decided to record.</p>
<p>The program for the triple CD likewise changed from the beginning to the end of the recording sessions. It gradually grew larger as I “unearthed” wonderful compositions new to me, and as well as by adding some works that I had recorded previously. Thereby, the selection became all the more expansive and richer.</p>

<ul><li><strong>ABOUT CATALOG</strong></li></ul>
<p><span>The CD set is further accompanied by</span> <strong>Serbian/English catalogue</strong> <span>with about 100 pages, edited by musicologist Ivana Miladinović Prica. </span>Wishing to “gather together” these wonderful composers, I thought that my idea would not be fully complete without a consideration of their thoughts alongside their music. And also to hear from some of our leading musical experts who could bring the circle of composers into an artistic-conceptual context. This is how the work on the accompanying catalogue began. I am very happy about that.<em><em><b><em><b><strong><strong><b><span><span><b><b><em><b><strong><strong><i><span> </span></i></strong></strong></b></em></b></b></span></span></b></strong></strong></b></em></b></em></em></p>

<p>I took the subtitle of the anthology “breathing in/breathing out“ from the eponymous film. At that point of my life breathing was very important to me.

I am Nada Kolundzija, a Belgrade-based pianist. I was always attracted to contemporary music.  I followed from one clue to the next, compelled to the chase in a gloriously never-ending process. I have passion and love for my exciting, beautiful and endless work. I am exploring, performing and promoting classical contemporary music over a career spanning more than four decades. I have performed more than 1000 concerts at 3 continents in 28 countries. I am a recipient of national and international awards and recognitions for artistic achievement in contemporary music and my name appears in Oxford’s Book of Successful People of Serbia.
Here is my biography:http://www.nadakolundzija.info/biography.html

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>A little bit about myself: I grew up in Wyomissing, PA. Yes, Taylor Swift also grew up there, and no, I do not write country music. I'm currently studying vocal jazz at the Frost School of Music in Miami, and have a background in classical, theatre, and pop. I play the piano. Dogs are very important to me!!! Lately, my favorite thing to eat has been roasted mushrooms (seriously. slice em, toss em with olive oil, salt, pepper, and some herbs, and throw em in the oven on a shallow pan for 30-45 minutes. It's a magical thing). </p>
<p>Ok, so let's get down to it. About the project: We'll be recording 5 original tracks (and one bonus acoustic demo) of mine. We are hoping to incorporate some horn, string, and wind arrangements, too. A lot of people are going to put a lot of time and heart into this, and I want to make sure that they are treated accordingly!! I would love to pay out of pocket, but I'm just a wee college student with a thin wallet. I also want to give the opportunity to those interested to pre-order the EP!</p>
<p>I am already blown away by the response of those who have heard my music. It's a real honor to perform in front of such receptive audiences. Thank you in advance to all those who will continue to support me through this campaign and otherwise! You are all so great!!</p>

<h3>Serious words:</h3>

<li>Colin McKinley! This man is going to handle all of the production aspects. He will push buttons! He will place microphones! He will do lots of things that I vaguely understand! Colin has already put in so many hours discussing plans, attending rehearsals, and recording scratch audio for me. He's an angel.</li>
<li>The band! The musicians will put in time. They will skip dinner on occasion and play beautifully always. They deserve some love.</li>
<li>All additional money raised will go toward the horn, string, and wind arrangements, and production costs of physical CDs and such. If I somehow raise way over what I ask for, I'll put that money into marketing. But that's just if I happen to raise enough to make that happen!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contributing to this campaign will reap exciting rewards like:<ul>
<li>hearing my voice sing words</li>
<li>special early downloads of a track or two</li>
<li>a song written for you?? possibly</li>
<li>a private concert??? maybe</li>
<li>a personal thank you note???? definitely</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I don't quite reach the goal I set, all of the money will still go to Colin and the musicians, and I'll pay the rest of what I owe them out of pocket.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenge Accepted</h3>
<p>There's the possibility that I don't raise much money. I get it, crowd funding is annoying. In this case, it's a necessary evil. But I really do appreciate whatever support you could offer. If you contribute, bless your soul. I love you! If you don't, but you share the campaign, or think a nice thought like ""I hope she gets enough bread to feed her band and keep a smile on her face,"" bless you as well! I love you, too! If you scroll past this and think, ""that's annoying, please refrain,"" I can't blame you, but that makes me sad.</p>
<p>Basically, I can't wait to get moving on this EP, and hope you'll join me for the ride!</p>

[Prenez le temps de découvrir l'espace, les projets et les gens qui les font vivre à travers la vidéo promotionnelle]
Pour une toiture sans fuite

Le Récif se situe dans le village de Rivière-Trois-Pistoles dans le Bas-Saint-Laurent sur le bord du fleuve. Environ douze personnes y vivent de façon permanente. Cet espace comprend plusieurs ateliers tels qu'un atelier de bois, un atelier de montage vidéo et de retouche photo, une chambre noire, une salle de théâtre/projection, un atelier de couture, un atelier vélos et une salle de jam. Il comprend aussi une scène, une serre, des jardins et une cuisine collective. Nous avons plusieurs définitions pour cet endroit tel qu’une école libre, un centre d’éducation populaire, des résidences pour militant-es et artistes ainsi qu’un espace d’exploration de la vie militante et collective.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour financer le renouvellement de notre toiture et le changement de chauffage à l'huile pour un Rocket Stove dans une visée d'être plus écologique et plus économique. Les dépenses reliées à une maison sont assez élevées et constantes. Nous tenons à garder cet espace d'ateliers et de partage de savoir disponible aux gens qui y passent.
Nous avons besoin d'environ 13 000$ pour réaliser ces rénovations. Nous avons déjà collecté 2 000$ avec certains financements tels que des spectacles et la vente de certains meubles. Nous faisons appel à votre aide pour le 11 000$ manquant. 


 L'espace auquel vous contribuez:

Un espace qui soutient l’éducation populaire et la retransmet dans d’autres milieux engagés.
Un espace qui crée des liens entre les militantEs des milieux ruraux avec les militantEs des milieux urbains.
Un espace qui fait des liens avec les luttes sociales et environnementales.
Un espace de ressourcement pour explorer son bien-être et le bien-être collectif. La maison se situe dans un endroit magnifique du Québec, ce qui permet aux particpantEs de profiter de la nature et contribue à avoir un mode de vie plus reposé et plus concentré sur leur développement personnel.
Un lieu d’échange et d’exploration sur les possibilités de vivre des modes de vie alternative et soutenable dans le long terme.
Un espace qui s’inscrit dans la vie communautaire de la région.

    L'impact: Nous voulons continuer d'offrir cet espace d'ateliers gratuits et le partage des savoirs qui s'en dégage. Nous tenons aussi à continuer d'offrir des événements à contribution volontaire tel que l'école d'été, la cueillette des savoirs, que nous organisons pour le mois de juillet 2016. 
Pour plus d'informations:

Vos contributions nous aiderons à maintenir cet espace. 
 Merci pour votre aide!
Nous vous encourageons aussi à diffuser la campagne dans vos réseaux sociaux. Pour nous aider à atteindre nos objectifs.

Il y aura des mises à jour tout au long de la campagne Indiegogo.

<h2>Sponsor NatuReza and help it come alive!</h2>
<p>For the past several years, I have been working extra hard to make this album for you, composing the tunes, writing arrangements and lyrics for this very special project.</p>
<p><i>Natureza</i> is the Portuguese word for nature. I chose this title for the album because it synthetizes many ideas present in my songs. Taking a closer look at NatuReza:</p>
<p><i>Natu</i> - is a root for many words that expresses ideas like: where you are from, to be born, birth.</p>
<p><i>Reza</i> - means prayer, a spiritual chant, to have faith. </p>
<p>In NatuReza there are orixás, entities, waterfalls, stones, and all sorts of wild life.</p>
<p>This is an album about the Brazilian soul, a journey where we reconnect with the woods, animals, with the mythological culture of Brazil. The different ethnicities; the Black, the Native Indian, and the European, all siblings, dance, sing and drink in a festivity that celebrates NatuReza.    </p>
<p>I invite you to embark in NatuReza and rediscover the Brazilian culture. By entering, you will gain access to Brazil's wonderful folklore universe, see it's myths and legends, and experience this incredible journey through the landscapes of NatuReza.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My goal in this project is not only to deliver amazing music and perks but also to preserve Brazil's traditional identity.</h3>

Instead, we have packaged together a few items that are extensively exclusive and personable to you, our willing supporters.The journey from being military members to becoming successful artists have been a long one up until this point and there's plenty of traveling left to do. We've embraced the grind and are beyond ready to shake things up across hip-hop world. In return for your hand in helping us share our art, we offer a number of limited edition and autographed items for your collection. We thank you for your continued support, believing in our craft and accompanying us along the way. Let's keep building!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>After decades of primarily working on other people’s music I am finally ready to release a <strong>full-length solo album of my own songs</strong> into the world! The album is called <i><strong>""SILVER SUITCASE""</strong></i>, and I am looking for partners like you to come alongside me in this pursuit. </p>
<p>I’ve done as much as I can on my own and I’m reaching out to build a team of people to help finance the release of this record –<strong> mastering, artwork and photography, a publicity campaign, video production, video promotion, manufacturing CD’s and other merchandise (possibly even vinyl), radio promotion, and developing the live band</strong>.

<p><b>Pierce Opera House: </b>Housed in the old<b> Iron Banking Co. Building, </b>this three story <i>Italianate</i> building was built in 1871 by “General” James Pierce, a prominent figure in the industrial development of the Shenango Valley as well as in the history of American iron industry.  He founded the first bank in Sharpsville, the Iron Banking Co. Pierce’s son, Walter, started the town’s newspaper, <i>The Sharpsville Advertiser,</i> which was also located here.</p>
<div>
<p>The third floor of this building contains the <b>Pierce Opera House</b>. For about 40 years, it hosted operas, operettas, musical concerts, and programs of spoken word; early motion pictures were shown after their introduction. From the 1890s to about 1920, high school graduation ceremonies were held here, and in the first
decade of the 20th century, the occasional high school basketball game was played here as well. The opera house has been restored in the last decade and once again regularly hosts operas, plays and concerts. <br/></p>

</div><p>The main challenge is rising the absolute <b>minimum</b> we need to successfully launch our October debut concert.  If we reach our <b>goal</b> of<b> $6500,</b> we will be able to make this happen.</p><ul>
<li>We've teamed up with <b>ACTS</b> and their board to present this initiative.  We have what we think is a great idea, and they have the <b>experience</b> building an arts organization from the ground up.  They'll be here with us advising and supervising every step of the way.</li>
<li>ACTS is generously sponsoring us, but is not responsible for funding our budget.  That's up to us—and you.</li>
<li>ACTS is a recognized 501(c)3 charitable nonprofit by the IRS and as such, donations are <b>tax deductable</b> as allowed by law.</li>
<li>
<b>What happens if we don't reach the goal? </b>We have a few plans in place to be able to make our debut concert happen even if we don't meet our goal, but those involve compromises and cuts we hope we won't have to make.  We may have to hire less players or move our debut concert to the spring in order to collect more funds.  But we are optimistic that with your help, we can reach our goal.</li>
<li>
<b>What happens if we exceed our goal?</b>  We have plans for that too! <p style=""display: inline !important;"">If we meet our goal of $6500 and continue raising funds above our minimum, <b>we will be able to do so much more. </b>We've set some ""stretch goals"" past our minimum goal so you can get an idea:</p>
</li>
</ul><div>
<b>Stretch Goal 1 ($9000): </b>We’ll be able to pay the musicians slightly more and reimburse some pre-launch expenses.  <br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><b>Stretch Goal 2: ($13,500) </b>PTP will be <b>completely funded </b>for our debut concert: our musicians will be paid in full, our creative team will get paid, and we will have a <b>downpayment</b> on a spring concert and/or a 2017-18 season. We will also be able to pay for professional-quality videography for the concert and post-production.<i> If we reach this goal, all donors at the $100 dollar level and above will receive a USB drive containing all of the digital assets at their giving level, including bonus behind-the-scenes footage and some other goodies.</i></p>
<p><b>Stretch Goal 3 ($18,000+): </b>We’ll be able to take our ambitious plans and project them <b>several years</b> into the future.  While we can't publicly announce all of those plans, we can say that we've already had discussions with other arts people in the Shenango Valley about collaboration, concerts in other venues, and outreach into schools.  We want to be an integrated and vital part of the arts and education community of the Shenango Valley!</p>

The Area Community Theatre of Sharpsville (ACTS) was founded on February 1st, 2011.  ACTS is committed to providing leadership and education in cultural development and performing arts in the region, striving to create a legacy of quality entertainment by tapping the resources of all age groups and encouraging the pursuit of artistic talent.

Our musicians are professionals in their field: teachers, members of other professional orchestras, graduate students in music performance, and more. Click on the ""About"" link at the top right of the page to see all of the members of our team!
Pierce Opera House: Housed in the old Iron Banking Co. Building, this three story Italianate building was built in 1871 by “General” James Pierce, a prominent figure in the industrial development of the Shenango Valley as well as in the history of American iron industry.  He founded the first bank in Sharpsville, the Iron Banking Co. Pierce’s son, Walter, started the town’s newspaper, The Sharpsville Advertiser, which was also located here.

The third floor of this building contains the Pierce Opera House. For about 40 years, it hosted operas, operettas, musical concerts, and programs of spoken word; early motion pictures were shown after their introduction. From the 1890s to about 1920, high school graduation ceremonies were held here, and in the first
decade of the 20th century, the occasional high school basketball game was played here as well. The opera house has been restored in the last decade and once again regularly hosts operas, plays and concerts.

Risks & Challenges
The main challenge is rising the absolute minimum we need to successfully launch our October debut concert.  If we reach our goal of $6500, we will be able to make this happen.
We've teamed up with ACTS and their board to present this initiative.  We have what we think is a great idea, and they have the experience building an arts organization from the ground up.  They'll be here with us advising and supervising every step of the way.
ACTS is generously sponsoring us, but is not responsible for funding our budget.  That's up to us—and you.
ACTS is a recognized 501(c)3 charitable nonprofit by the IRS and as such, donations are tax deductable as allowed by law.

What happens if we don't reach the goal? We have a few plans in place to be able to make our debut concert happen even if we don't meet our goal, but those involve compromises and cuts we hope we won't have to make.  We may have to hire less players or move our debut concert to the spring in order to collect more funds.  But we are optimistic that with your help, we can reach our goal.

What happens if we exceed our goal?  We have plans for that too! If we meet our goal of $6500 and continue raising funds above our minimum, we will be able to do so much more. We've set some ""stretch goals"" past our minimum goal so you can get an idea:


Stretch Goal 1 ($9000): We’ll be able to pay the musicians slightly more and reimburse some pre-launch expenses.  

Stretch Goal 2: ($13,500) PTP will be completely funded for our debut concert: our musicians will be paid in full, our creative team will get paid, and we will have a downpayment on a spring concert and/or a 2017-18 season. We will also be able to pay for professional-quality videography for the concert and post-production. If we reach this goal, all donors at the $100 dollar level and above will receive a USB drive containing all of the digital assets at their giving level, including bonus behind-the-scenes footage and some other goodies.
Stretch Goal 3 ($18,000+): We’ll be able to take our ambitious plans and project them several years into the future.  While we can't publicly announce all of those plans, we can say that we've already had discussions with other arts people in the Shenango Valley about collaboration, concerts in other venues, and outreach into schools.  We want to be an integrated and vital part of the arts and education community of the Shenango Valley!

 If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still use whatever money we were able to raise to purchase the essential equipment in order to get our sound out into the world.      Not Sure?  
 It's possible that you may be skeptical investing in a start up a cappella group. However, we are very passionate about what we do and can offer a type of sound that Cleveland has been lacking for way too long!  
A cappella has been taking the world by storm, especially with the booming success of groups like the Pentatonix and movies / TV shows like Pitch Perfect. Since Cleveland has seen such a cultural and economic resurgence in recent years, why shouldn't our great city also be known for having great a cappella? Well it can be, starting with us.  
 You can still help!
If you happen to be strapped for cash (we understand, we're artists)  you can still help!  Please like our Harmonious A Cappella Facebook page and tell your friends about our fundraiser!   
Please help us achieve our goals!  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<b>All my pieces for cello and piano: </b><i>The Philosophy of Composition</i> (2009), inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's essay of the same title and a memorial to the South African poet Don Maclennan; a <i>New Work</i> (as yet untitled) for cello and piano (2016); and two short pieces - <i>Connectivity </i>(2008), composed for the Messiaen centenary, and an early <i>song without words </i>(1975). </div>
<div>
<b>Two solo pieces: </b><i>Pentimenti for solo cello</i> (2013), marking the centenary of the riotous premiere of 'The Rite of Spring'; <i>A Fractured Landscape for piano</i> (2010), a memorial to the writer and musician Edward Said.</div>
<p><b>WHO AM I?</b></p>
<p>I am a composer, born Cape Town in 1951, studied in Cape Town, Johannesburg and London, and received a doctorate in composition from Rhodes University in 2000. I moved to London in 1977 to continue my career as composer, pianist, teacher, writer and new music activist, returning in 1998 after the advent of democracy in South Africa. There I started ""Growing Composers"", a programme for mentoring young black composers, and an annual festival, ""New Music Indaba"", for the performance of new music. The artists on this planned CD are among many from all over the world who visited South Africa to give concerts and workshops. My overriding ambitions were twofold: to get previously disadvantaged composers onto the new music scene and to get South African new music onto the international stage. </p>
<p>My two previous CDs collected my solo piano music up to 2004 (Jill Richards) and my string quartets and piano quintet (Fitzwilliam String Quartet), and were praised in the South African, British and German press. You can read reviews and more about me at <a href=""http://www.michaelblake.co.za."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.michaelblake.co.za.</a></p>
<p>You can read more about the artists who will record the new CD at <a href=""http://www.,gauwerky.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.,gauwerky.de</a> and <a href=""http://www.daanvandewalle.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.daanvandewalle.com.</a></p>
<p><b>WHAT IMPACT COULD THIS CD HAVE?</b></p>
<p>The CD recording of my complete cello music by two superb artists gives me  an opportunity to have another aspect of my music in the public domain. And having it played by wonderfully committed artists, takes the experience to another level. South African composers do not often have this opportunity and I would like to think that the next generation will see this as a model and inspiration for what they can do themselves.</p>
<p>Your contributions will quite simply make it possible to turn many months of creative hard work by the composer and the performers into a beautiful and long-lasting end product, one that listeners will appreciate and will definitely want to have in their CD libraries - for both the aural and visual content.</p>
</div><div> <p><b>WHAT DO WE NEED AND WHAT WILL YOU GET?</b></p>
<p>We need around €7,500 to get this CD onto the shelves and into your homes. That will cover the cost of recording, editing and mastering the CD, producing the booklet and manufacturing and distributing the final product, covering the artists' fees and travel to, and accommodation in, Cologne during the recording.</p>
