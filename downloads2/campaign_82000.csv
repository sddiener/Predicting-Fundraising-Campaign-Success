<h3>Something to think about...</h3>
<p>What if you could change the world... with music? What if you could help bridge the divide between people and cultures with a music festival? Would you see value in that? Would you support such an endeavor? We know we can't change the whole world with one festival, but we can offer people the chance to find unity, one person at a time. From there it can spread. We think this is very worthwhile goal. Will you help us?</p>
<p>The inspiration for the Whidbey Island Guitar Festival is just that; building bridges between people and cultures. We invite people, both audience and musicians, from varied backgrounds to come together for one weekend of world-class music. Hopefully, they will leave with broadened horizons, both musically and culturally.</p>
<p>This is art with a heart. We are asking for your support to make this vision happen. Help us support a heart of peace and unity while also helping us support musical artists. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this years festival is $5,000. </p>
<p>The money is to pay all of our musicians, purchase advertising, cover expenses of putting on a festival, and pay our small staff after all that. Hopefully, we will exceed our goal so we can begin plans for the 2020 festival as well. Our hope is to grow this into a much larger festival in the future.</p>
<p>In return, we will include the names of contributors in our festival program and on our facebook page (unless you prefer to remain anonymous). We are offering various levels of contribution with a variety of thank you gifts that range from a happy ""Thank You"" to festival tickets that can be used or donated, to private concerts with Andre Feriante.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is possibly the only festival of it's kind in the world to mix musical styles during the same concert. Most music festivals focus on a single genre; Classical music, Blues, Jazz, Rock... etc. This is especially true for a festival focused on purely virtuoso instrumental music. </p>
<p>Creating this festival has created opportunities for our featured musicians to reach out to a wider audience and possibly find new fans. It creates the opportunity for our audience to experience a wider range of music than they would normally be exposed to. Finally, it creates a bridge between people and cultures to share two afternoons of mutual understanding. Maybe, just maybe it will break down some of the metaphorical barriers people create and potentially lead to new friendships. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In short, a festival is an expensive proposition. Every year we risk running in the red with our budget. To feasibly continue offering the festival, we have to ensure that all expenses will get covered. If you're a supporter of the arts, we invite you to help us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional musicians do not, and should not, work for free. It is our goal every year to pay our musicians an appropriate rate.  </li>
<li>We have to advertise so that people know about the festival. Advertising includes the printing of posters and Facebook targeted advertising. When the budget allows, it can also include radio ads, print ads, etc. </li>
<li>There are venue and equipment expenses. </li>
<li>Finally, the small festival staff puts in countless hours every year to plan and prepare for the festival. All the other expenses come before paying them. </li>
</ul>

<p>    Hi everyone, my name is Jay.  I began the Grey Mourning project back in 2004.  This has been a labor of love to say the least!  Through various line-up changes, taking time off to focus on personal matters, and numerous other stumbling blocks, it has been a constant source of musical outlet for me.  After 15 years, I feel it's time to put it to rest as I continue to grow older and desire to explore new musical territory that doesn't fit under this project.  In coordination with the 15 year anniversary, our final studio e.p. will be released this December.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>    We are looking to raise at least $1000 to cover all initial costs.  This includes CD pressings, Digital release to iTunes, Spotify, etc, Vinyl copies of the e.p, Merchandise options such as T-shirts, bracelets, buttons, etc, as well as helping to cover professional sound and recording of the final show on December 7th (all contributors will receive the final show digitally at NO EXTRA CHARGE!)  Any additional funds raised beyond the $1000 will assist us in being able to provide additional merchandise items and potential video recording of our final show.  A portion of all proceeds beyond the $1000 will also be donated to various charities.</p>
<p>    We are not looking to make any financial gains off of this release, just to simply break even and provide our fans with an awesome e.p, some great merchandise, and the opportunity to help those in need.  Portions of proceeds from our final live shows will also be donated to select charities in addition to any potential overflow of support we receive on here.</p>
<p>  There are lots of great perks ranging from physical CDs to T-shirts, to combination package options, to booking a private acoustic performance for you and your closest friends!    Even if you are unable to donate, please share with your friends and ask them to contribute (tell them the live acoustic performance would be a killer Birthday gift!)</p>

<h3>READ ON TO DISCOVER ALL ABOUT IT:</h3>
<h3>As a teenager growing up in Newcastle in the 1960's John Plane developed a passion for music that has lasted throughout his life. Living in Gloucestershire he became a regular music goer around the local venues every week and John found people kept asking him what was on and where.</h3>
<h3>John realised the need for a live music listing and in 2012 as a way of giving something back to the community he created Local Music Events group on Facebook and for free and for fun began compiling a weekly list to let people know what was on in Gloucestershire, updated daily, and on being given his first ever digital camera for his birthday John began taking photos and videos at local events creating Local Music Events Youtube channel which to date has had 440,000 views.</h3>
<h3>The format of the weekly event list proved to be a winning one and it's popularity proved so successful membership of Local Music Events group on Facebook has grown to 4,000+ with some 500 events listed every month.</h3>
<h3>In October 2016 in recognition of his contribution to the community John was nominated for ""Our Life Gloucester"" project and a 7' x 5' portrait of him by local artist Russell Haines was hung in Eastgate Shopping Centre in Gloucester City centre.   </h3>
<h3>Collating all the information, typing it up and posting the list week in and week out has become virtually a full time job and 7 years on knowing he could not keep doing this for ever John came up with the original and inventive idea of creating a permanent interactive web site where everyone can input events straight onto the list.</h3>
<h3>John enlisted the services of Zayd Dawood Course Leader of Digital &amp; Web Technologies at the University of Gloucestershire to build the web site to his design and help turn his idea into a reality and John's years of experience together with Zayd's computer expertise has proved to be a winning combination.</h3>
<h3>The event list on Local Music Events web site will be in weekly and monthly format with no deadline for adding events allowing people to add events a month (or more) ahead - or the week or night before - or even on the day.</h3>
<h3>The site will have a list of Venues (that can be added to) which will come up automatically with only those having a GL postcode being accepted and will be programmed to sort by postcode putting events for one area altogether and venues and performers and events names can be highlighted as ""clickable links"" that connect directly to their Facebook pages enabling people to look at further details if they want.</h3>
<h3>As well as being accessible via the web the weekly/monthly listing will remain accessible on Local Music Events Facebook page with a link to the site as the permanent ""pinned post"" at the top of the group page.</h3>
<h3>Venues across the County have expressed their support and local musicians have been eager to do their bit for the campaign providing 100+ signed CD's and other cool stuff to be offered as ""Perks"" in return for donations, along with exclusive design T Shirts created by John and printed by Cross The Tees . </h3>
<h3>John does everything for free and all funds raised by this campaign will be used to pay for the creation and future development of the web site and a Local Music Events account has been opened with The Halifax. </h3>
<h3>John has chosen the flexible funding option and regardless of whether the target figure is met or not the site will go ahead as planned.</h3>
<h3>Have fun, pick a ""Perk"" and be part of the future of live music in Gloucestershire. </h3>

<p><strong>The background</strong></p>
<p>We got together as TwoManTing some years ago when we were both playing in dance band, Le Cod Afrique at venues such as Montreux Jazz Festival, WOMAD and Glastonbury. Our music is inspired by Jah-man's origins in Sierra Leone, and influenced by both of our lives in the UK - but most people just call it ""sunshine""!</p>
<p>We released our debut album ""Legacy"" in 2011, and since then we've been touring the UK constantly and spending most of the summer playing to lovely festival crowds around the country. This was followed by our second album ""Say What?"" in 2015.</p>
<p>We both feel that TwoManTing is the most creative project we've worked on - it combines dance music with social comment, and improvisation with feel-good sunny vibes. Audience response is heart-warming and sometimes humbling. We've had great reviews in fRoots magazine, Songlines magazine and on BBC Radios 3 and 6 Music.</p>
<p><strong>What would we like to achieve?</strong></p>
<p>The new album will enable us to continue touring and also further our musical career as we can get more radio airplay and media coverage.</p>
<p>Ideally, we need £3,500 to record, print and promote the new album. Life on the road is very hand-to-mouth so we're unable to fund that ourselves, but by asking people to pre-order we can produce the third album that we feel the project needs to progress. We plan to spend the money roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Recording £1,500</p>
<p>Production £500</p>
<p>Printing £1,000</p>
<p>Promotion £500</p>
<p><strong>What are we offering in return?</strong></p>
<p>As well as downloads, signed CDs and T-shirts, we'll have some exclusive perks to offer. Jah-man is offering drum lessons, Jon will give guitar lessons, and we'll even come and play a private gig for you and your friends.</p>
<p>We hope you can help by contributing financially to our campaign, but if you're unable to, please be kind enough to tell your friends and share this crowd-funding page around online.</p>

<h3>Who the heck am I?</h3>
<p>Oh yeah, true, you may never have heard of me or my music before. I'm a Canadian singer-songwriter originally from Saskatoon, now based in Toronto. I'm fortunate to have found my passion in life - writing and performing songs for people who like to listen.</p>

<p>It's coming up 6 years since I released my first album <i>Unbreakable </i>and a whole bunch of exciting has happened since then. I crowdfunded my second album <i>Anywhere From Here </i>and then played my way to Vancouver and back, thanks to the Via Rail Artist On Board Program,  making many new friends and fans along the way.  An absolute career highlight would have to be my recent opportunity to perform, for my first time ever, at the legendary Dakota Tavern in Toronto.</p>
<p>I'm eager to get back into the studio soon and see where this new album takes me...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I'll be teaming up with producer Mitch Girio (Emma Lee, Kirsten Jones, Susan Cadogan) and a fine collection of local musicians, including hunky Peter Collins, lucky Pete Lambert, Mark Mariash and special guest Kevin Breit  at Union Sound Company in Toronto and at The Slow Cooker, in Scarborough. The album will be mastered at Joao Carvalho Mastering in Toronto.</p>
<p>I plan to release the first single in early 2020, but those who have the <strong>ALL ACCESS PASS</strong> will get a listen much earlier. The album will be released  mid-2020. (I know, it's a ways off, but a goal without a plan is just a wish).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Songs</h3>
<p>A lot has happened since he last time I was in the studio. I've experienced life, love, laughter, loss, gotten wiser (I hope), learned to be myself more fully and let go of what does not serve me.</p>
<p>After releasing my EP <i>Two </i>a lot of people commented that they loved the fuller, more pop sound, so folks, you'll be getting more of that this time around (with more magical string arrangements by Mitch Girio).</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Money</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $10,000 to start with. What I need to complete the project is $12,000. To realize my ultimate vision for the project (which includes hiring a radio tracker to shop the album to radio, creating music videos and hiring a publicist for the album release), I need $15,000. For more details on the budget, scroll to the bottom of the page (""The Budget"").</p>

Who the heck am I?
Oh yeah, true, you may never have heard of me or my music before. I'm a Canadian singer-songwriter originally from Saskatoon, now based in Toronto. I'm fortunate to have found my passion in life - writing and performing songs for people who like to listen.

It's coming up 6 years since I released my first album Unbreakable and a whole bunch of exciting has happened since then. I crowdfunded my second album Anywhere From Here and then played my way to Vancouver and back, thanks to the Via Rail Artist On Board Program,  making many new friends and fans along the way.  An absolute career highlight would have to be my recent opportunity to perform, for my first time ever, at the legendary Dakota Tavern in Toronto.

The Songs
A lot has happened since he last time I was in the studio. I've experienced life, love, laughter, loss, gotten wiser (I hope), learned to be myself more fully and let go of what does not serve me.
After releasing my EP Two a lot of people commented that they loved the fuller, more pop sound, so folks, you'll be getting more of that this time around (with more magical string arrangements by Mitch Girio).

<p>This project is an exciting new step in my journey as an artist and I can't believe the time has finally come... my first music video shoot. I grew up glued to the screen watching my favorite artists' music videos on MTV. I found myself captivated by the worlds these artists were creating and the stories they were able to tell through their visuals, giving so much more depth to the songs that already meant so much to me. And now, I have the opportunity to share the worlds that exist inside my head with all of you, bringing a little more insight into what these songs mean to me and the places from which I created them.</p>
<p>As an artist and creator, so much of what I do is in collaboration with other incredible creatives. It means so much to me to be able to open up that collaboration even further, to share this process with you, my friends and family, as well as to have the opportunity to work with such an amazing team of creators! </p>
<p>Partnering with director Brit Phelan, I will be taking two new songs I have been working on -- Worst Days and Wtv, It's Cool -- and creating visual representations of the wonderful worlds in which these songs exist. I can’t wait to be able to share these videos with you! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>About Phé </h3>
<p>Contemporary R&amp;B singer-songwriter Phé offers up a dose of soulful prowess, as her commanding vocals, combined with raw and honest lyrics, expose a realness that truly sets her apart from the crowd. Born and raised in East Vancouver, Phé fell in love with the arts at an early age, taking to the stage as a dancer, actress, and singer. Throughout high school, she attended the Sarah McLachlan School of Music where she took her first official voice lessons -- exploring her voice and honing in on her skills as a performer. It wasn’t until Phé graduated from high school that she made the decision to officially pursue her career and post-secondary education in music. She attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she studied vocal performance, music business, and songwriting, developing her unique style and refined her songwriting skills.</p>
<p>Having sung as a background vocalist for artists such as Aloe Blacc, Ella Vos, and Marianas Trench, Phé is ready to step into her light, sharing her own stories in the hopes of opening up a space in which her listeners can explore vulnerability, healing, and self-growth.</p>
<p><br/>Following the release of her impressive debut single “Feel You”, in spring of 2018 -- gaining over 150K streams on Spotify -- Phé dropped her debut EP, CRISIS, landing placements in Spotify editorial playlists Just Vibing and The Launch, and features in publications such as Nylon Magazine and Live Nations: Ones to Watch. With her latest release,  “You and Me” being featured on UK's No.1 TV show, Love Island, Phé prepares for the release of her next single, excited to share her new music and expanded sound with the world. </p>

<div><h3>About Brit</h3></div>
<div>
<p>Brit Phelan is a director living &amp; working in Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Films, commercials, digital videos, and more—Brit can make it all. Her rare, two-for-one director / editor skill set is the result of a hardly traditional career path. But that’s Brit. Conventional wisdom hasn’t always applied to her. <br/><br/>Brit started growing her professional network nearly a decade ago working with shops like Wieden+Kennedy, 72andSunny, Anomaly, and Google—ultimately leading her down a multidisciplinary road peppered with the cinematography, editorial and directorial experiences that shaped the unique creative vision she continues to polish daily.<br/><br/>Today, Brit doesn’t just bring beautiful art to life—she gives it a true purpose powerful enough to change the way people think, how they behave, and even what they do. Maybe that’s why brands like Nike, Abercrombie, Gymboree, Modcloth, Verizon, Coca-Cola, and Old Spice call on Brit to bring their stories to life in ways that make us all stop and think about a product in an entirely new light.<br/><br/>As a tried-and-true multidisciplinary creative, Brit knows great work never comes from following established industry norms. Her wide variety of experiences across all categories of film is exactly why Brit refuses to limit herself to the accepted ways of doing things. <br/><br/>Brit genuinely loves creating, and the passion she brings to every project proves it. As a kid, Brit would religiously watch MTV. She would tune in every day for the top ten TRL countdown to see if the artist made visuals similar to what she imagined in her head while listening to them. <br/><br/>Taking the next steps to her career as a Director requires dedication and determination. Sometimes it means rolling up your sleeves and doing new work on your own volition.<br/><br/>It's rare to come across such a great partnership. Partnering with Phé is a unique opportunity to not only create inspiring work, but to work together to grow as creative beings, and create future opportunities as artist and director. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As an artist, making music videos has always been a dream of mine! They can be such a beautiful medium through which artists are able to better portray and share their stories. And it was a goal of mine to make at least one music video before the end of 2019. June rolled around, and it didn't look as though this dream was going to become a reality -- the music wasn't finished yet, I was struggling to find someone whose I could see eye to eye with in terms of the creative direction, and I had no money to invest into a project of this size. </p>
<p>Then, one day I get an email from a stranger introducing themselves as Brit! Brit told me her story and said she had heard about me through a friend who worked in music and branding and asked if I would be interested in meeting to chat about possibly working together. Of course, I said yes. It just felt right. So we met for coffee -- both ordering an iced chai tea.. I mean come on, definitely meant to be ahaha -- and we started chatting. I showed her a couple of songs that I was working on, pitched her my video ideas, and the ball started rolling immediately. She pulled out a pen and notebook and started jotting down notes and drawing set sketches, and for the first time, I actually saw the vision coming to life.  </p>
<p>I don't know what you all believe, but I truly think the Universe brought us together. It all just happened too perfectly and at the exact right moment. If Brit had reached out to me to work togetehr a year ago I would have really wanted to but the music wouldn't have been right and my understanding of my artistry simply wouldn't be what it is today.  But, I felt it in my gut when I read her first email that there was potential for this to be a beautiful partnership through which we would create many wonderful things, and I knew I had the songs and the ideas from which we would be able to create something magical. And so, here we are! We've got the music, vision, team, passion, and now, with a little bit of help from all of you, we are getting one step closer to turning our vision into a reality which we can then share with the world. xo </p>
</div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p>In order to produce these videos at a level and quality that will allow us to stand out in today's market, we must invest both time and money into this project. As independent creators, we have time! But unfortunately, money can be a little harder to secure.</p>
<p>While we have a large number of people volunteering their time, expertise, and equipment -- simply because of their passion and drive to see these videos happen -- there are some costs that are simply unavoidable. Below we have broken down the funds that we are asking for your help with, in order to properly produce this project. </p>
<p>Camera/Lighting - $1500 </p>
<p>Location - $2000</p>
<p>Props - $2500 </p>
<p>Truck - $300 </p>
<p>TOTAL = $6,300</p>
<p>*Any funds raised beyond our goal will be used towards marketing, distribution, festival submissions, and more! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the popularity of online streaming platforms and social media, today's music industry is highly saturated and competitive, making it hard for independent artists to break through all the noise. For new independent artists to have even a chance of standing out, they must have a wide-reaching and captivating online presence, as well as music that is able to compete.</p>
<p>Visual content plays a huge role in the discovery of new artists among fans, as it creates a new avenue through which artists can be found online, and invites viewers deeper into the world of the artist, giving them further insight into the artist's mind and perspective.</p>
<p>With your help, we are hoping to give current and future fans the opportunity to further get to know and love Phé, bringing her deepest thoughts and feelings to life with breathtaking visuals.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are attempting to accomplish a big feat here. The goal of shooting 2 videos in one day is not a task to be taken lightly, and we are sure to run into any number of obstacles and challenges throughout the day. But, with our carefully put together team of experts, and countless hours of planning, and preparation, we feel confident in our ability to accomplish our goal and face any challenges that present themselves along the way. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your support means the world, and we really wouldn't be able to do this without your help! While we understand that you may not be able to contribute financially, there are other ways you can support us in this journey.</p>
<p><strong><i>Help us to spread the word!</i></strong></p>
<p>Share this with your friends, your mom and dad, siblings, co-workers, grandparents, neighbors, your crush... anyone who you think might be interested in contributing to the dreams of an independent artist trying to make it in the world.  And who knows, with your help, she just might! </p>

Budget Breakdown
In order to produce these videos at a level and quality that will allow us to stand out in today's market, we must invest both time and money into this project. As independent creators, we have time! But unfortunately, money can be a little harder to secure.
While we have a large number of people volunteering their time, expertise, and equipment -- simply because of their passion and drive to see these videos happen -- there are some costs that are simply unavoidable. Below we have broken down the funds that we are asking for your help with, in order to properly produce this project. 
Camera/Lighting - $1500 
Location - $2000
Props - $2500 
Truck - $300 
TOTAL = $6,300
*Any funds raised beyond our goal will be used towards marketing, distribution, festival submissions, and more! 

The Impact
With the popularity of online streaming platforms and social media, today's music industry is highly saturated and competitive, making it hard for independent artists to break through all the noise. For new independent artists to have even a chance of standing out, they must have a wide-reaching and captivating online presence, as well as music that is able to compete.
Visual content plays a huge role in the discovery of new artists among fans, as it creates a new avenue through which artists can be found online, and invites viewers deeper into the world of the artist, giving them further insight into the artist's mind and perspective.
With your help, we are hoping to give current and future fans the opportunity to further get to know and love Phé, bringing her deepest thoughts and feelings to life with breathtaking visuals.

<h3>HEY THERE!</h3>
<p>Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign in support of my Sophomore album, ""Melancholy""</p>
<p>I have been working on this album since I was 17-years-old and finally at the age of 19, I am at a place where I feel ready to share it with you all!</p>

<h3>ABOUT ME AND THIS ALBUM:</h3>
<p>My name is Ginger Rodriguez, I'm a 19-year-old singer-songwriter and music producer from Austin, Texas.

However, I need your help with releasing my upcoming singles. It will cost about $200 to release all four singles and get them distributed to all music sellers and streaming platforms; however, as an unemployed college student living through a pandemic, this is not the easiest task. So if you are in a place where you can make a donation that won't hurt the bank, please help be apart of making this album come to fruition. Thank you!</p>

<h3>BE MY RECORD LABEL</h3>
<p>In today's music industry, becoming a successful Rock artist, is nearly impossible without a record label. An independent artist also has zero chance of being on radio without funding. Sadly, that is just the way it works. The only way around the ""big machine"" (or major labels) is YOU!<br/>There is simply no way I can continue touring or make this my career without YOUR support. SO how how do we do it? </p>
<p>It all starts with the music...</p>
<p>The competition is higher than it ever has been. In the past, <i>""A RECORD DEAL""</i>  meant, a record label would typically front the cost of recording the record including, studio rental, production, engineering, mixing and mastering. The label would also be 100% in control of distribution. THEY decide who hears you. Then, the label would also invest in the artist by publicizing and campaigning the record to the applicable markets (I.E. - FM radio, XM satellite radio, Spotify playlists curators etc...). A record label also fronts the cost of touring and merchandise. Unlike an individual, big labels can absorb the huge overhead cost. BUT! In turn, the artist gives up rights to their own name, music and royalties and sometimes identity and dignity. Most become puppets. In the end, the artist has to pay back the label and then some... The label always wins.</p>
<p><i>""SELLING YOUR SOUL TO ROCK N ROLL""</i> -  As the old saying goes...</p>
<p>Sadly, even these traditional <strong><i>""record deals""</i></strong> do not exist anymore. Most indy artist now have to pay the label... yeah, you heard that right.<br/>The artist takes all the risk, as long as they have the money. Even rich parents can't buy you success in the music industry today. (especially in the Rock-Metal genre) Really, there is only ONE WAY to win this battle, and that is YOU the fans. It is 100% up to you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why so much?</h3>
<p>A high quality full length studio album is way more expensive than you think and you get what you pay for. Without a good quality record, promotion, publicity &amp; distribution, a new artist doesn't stand a chance at getting on heard in todays market. But it all must start in the studio.</p>
<p>Studio rental cost, record producer fees, engineers, artwork, mixing and mastering can be astronomical. A band like ""Disturbed"" for example, spends well over a million dollars on a full length album. Guns N' Roses spent $13M on their new record. I am simply asking for enough to cover my recording cost. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A simple breakdown</h3>
<p>How much does a song cost exactly?</p>
<p>Well, there is no definitive answer, but I can give you an idea of what I have experienced in the past. Here is some examples of very BASIC costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Daily studio/equipment rental $500 - $1,000 per day<br/>(quality microphones, engineers and isolation rooms are a must)</li>
<li>Producer fees $1500 - $3500 per day</li>
<li>Mixing - $500 - $1000 per song</li>
<li>Mastering - $250 - $500 per song</li>
<li>Engineer $250 - $500 per day</li>
<li>Artwork for album $1000 - $3500</li>
<li>Basic essential (food, gas, lodging etc) $200 - $300 per day</li>
<li>Manufacturing physical copies (500 CD's at $3 each) $1500 plus shipping </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The main difference between me and a typical band is I write and perform basically everything on my record. I must emphasize, this is with ME doing a lot of the footwork MYSELF. Being in a traditional ""band"" means the load would be distributed amongst 4-5 other guys + a manager. Me being a ""solo artist"" means I carry the entire load of EVERYTHING... and boy does it get heavy!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How long do we have?</h3>
<p>The campaign is set for 60 days only! </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand some people just cannot contribute financially. Believe me when I say, I have been there before... at one time I was homeless and living in my car with nothing. Not even a guitar. Word of mouth is everything. I believe in networking. Maybe you know someone who can contribute. Talk to them and tell them why you are passionate about this cause. It takes a small village to make this happen and that includes YOU.</p>

<li>Ask your friends to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>SHARE, SHARE, SHARE on social media (I.E. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc...) Don't forget to hashtag and tag my artist profile.<br/>Remember when sharing, to talk about WHY you are passionate for this campaign</li>

<h3>Boy, Am I Glad to See You! </h3>
<p>Hey there! David, Robert, Patrick, Tyrone, and Steve here, wishing you brightest of fall seasons.</p>
<p>Over the past two months we have released 4 new singles titled  Constellation, Monsoons, -22, +27, and Mummy! First we want to thank you for all of your wonderful support of our new music. We hope you have enjoyed the singles, and we would love your support on our next big project! This November, we are taking this show on the road - headed West, for a 10 city west coast tour titled “Boy, Am I Glad To See You!” The essence of this tour, and our upcoming EP, is quite simply - joy - in connection with others. A friend, a parent, a lover, a dog, a neighborhood cat, a mouse in your house; whomever it might be - you’re never alone. “A person is a person through other persons; you can’t be human in isolation. You are human only in relationships.” - Desmond Tutu. When you walk into a room, and see someone that matters to you…let them know: BOY, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past year, Spacebones has played over 60 shows in Chicago, and along the east coast. We are proud members of Chicago’s DIY Music scene, and while we love playing our own music, we also run an art space called Hungry City Collective, alongside brother, rapper and producer Woes. Our priority first and foremost is to build community. Our event space is located at division and western in Chicago’s Humboldt Park neighborhood. We book shows - for Chicago (and touring) artists of all mediums. We focus mainly on musical performers, but round out the events by inviting multimedia artists to sell or display their work throughout the space. As artists ourselves, we know what it’s like to book, promote, and play shows; this has given us real insight into what makes a great event and performance happen; in contrast to bar or club owner, who’s main priority is to pull a profit each night. It’s no secret this venture isn’t a big money maker, we keep entrance fees low, and we pay our artists and staff well - whatever’s left over goes into covering costs for the next show. We think, at least we hope, people see Spacebones as a band that loves to consume music as much as we love to create it.  Our Next event, and first show of the tour is Saturday October 26th.</p>

<p>""One thing art does for us is <strong>transform what we ignore and find mundane into aesthetic experiences</strong>. Brown’s work does exactly that; humanizing what listeners rightly expect to be a coldly clinical topic."" <i>San Francisco Classical Voice</i></p>
<p><i>Mortal Lessons</i> is an hour-long ""medical oratorio"" based on a book of the same name by Richard Selzer. A former Yale surgeon, Dr. Selzer's writing combines his intimate knowledge of the human body with a love for baroque language and flights of fancy that are by turns grotesque and sublime. <i>Mortal Lessons</i> explores our relationship with hospitals, with our bodies, and the people who tend to them—what’s funny, what’s sacred, what’s embarrassing, what’s absurd, and what’s just plain disgusting.

Mortal Lessons is an hour-long ""medical oratorio"" based on a book of the same name by Richard Selzer. A former Yale surgeon, Dr. Selzer's writing combines his intimate knowledge of the human body with a love for baroque language and flights of fancy that are by turns grotesque and sublime. Mortal Lessons explores our relationship with hospitals, with our bodies, and the people who tend to them—what’s funny, what’s sacred, what’s embarrassing, what’s absurd, and what’s just plain disgusting. Life, death, love, and all the rest.

<h2>Embracing Oceans and our Dear Dawn, Project</h2>
<p>""A dynamic duo, comprised of American vocalist and oboist, Skye Butterfield and Brazilian rock guitarist and two-time Latin Grammy nominee, Edi Roque, combine their worlds of musical polarities into an unparalleled expression."" -Voyage LA </p>
<p>Embracing Oceans, will be releasing our debut album on February 20th, 2021. We have been intricately working for the past year and we are so excited to have completed the work! The two of us are determined to use our platform to contribute to mechanisms of change. This past year Skye lost her Auntie Dawn to pancreatic cancer and finishing this album has been a very healing process, with the album being a tribute to her and her beautiful spirit. From day one, Dawn's passion for music was felt by everyone around her. When she sang, her voice filled the atmosphere and her spirit would vibrate the universe. Beyond her love for music, she was an active advocate for the empowerment of disadvantaged youth through the arts, community engagement, and personal connection. By donating the proceeds of our album to an organization aligned with her beliefs that also follows the dialogue Embracing Oceans would like to contribute to, is the most honorable way for us to let the world continue to feel her impact. We will be donating album proceeds to Extraordinary Families, a non-profit here in LA, that serves as a lifeline for children and youth in foster care to provide the stability and safety they deserve. Their vision is that every child, youth, and family in child welfare will have the ability to achieve their hopes and fulfill their dreams. Our multilayered campaign offers the opportunity to share our affinity for music, our passion for community connection with you, and bring you into our orbit.</p>

<h3>What is Foster Care?</h3>
<p>The child welfare system or foster care system, refers to the array of services and programs designed to ensure children's safety and well-being. Most families become involved in the system after suspected child abuse or neglect. Children remain in foster care temporarily until they are able to safely reunify with their family, are adopted, or ""age out"" of foster care and transition into adulthood. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Extraordinary Families</h3>
<p>Founded in 1994, Extraordinary Families has committed decades to the improvement of foster care outcomes. They work with a collective group of non-profits, private entities, and public sectors, such as the California Alliance of Child and Family Services and the Foster Together Network, to inform and advocate for policies that favor the child-centric approach. Much of Extraordinary Families work is pushing policy to create systemic betterment for youth in foster care, but that is just a fraction of the work they do. They search for and vet families that are open to both fostering and providing lifelong permanency for a child in need. One of the many traumas a foster child can experience is the instability of permanency; 95% of children experienced only one foster home under the services of Extraordinary Families. In 2019 alone, they successfully finalized 36 adoptions and supported 175 foster youth. They are committed to finding families for children, not children for families. There is however an immense amount of teenage foster youth being tossed around in the system with little to no support to guide them into adulthood. Extraordinary Families' UP4Youth Program supports young adults to help counter negative life effects, teaching them basic life skills and connecting them to the resources they need to reach their fullest potential. The goal of the program is to help youth build the personal life skills necessary for a successful transition to adulthood, employment, and a lifelong network of peers and mentors to help them along the way this helps ensure they know that someone is truly always there for them.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are pleased to implore our community to contribute to a cause that might otherwise have been invisible. Since our production was self-financed, our financial goal is to ensure a sizeable donation will be made to Extraordinary Families. We hope to increase their visibility and recognition beyond the local community. You can be the difference! </p>
<p>Along with our album, we are offering some Embracing Oceans Merchandise that is exclusive for the campaign! Additionally, we are collaborating on the production of a virtual concert that will be held this summer. The proceeds from this concert will be donated in FULL to Extraordinary Families - there might even be some surprise performances...you will just have to find out ;-).</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, our donation will continue as planned based on the orders filled!</p>

<h3><strong>DAMON JOHNSON'S INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN 2020</strong></h3>
<p>Greetings to you all, friends and music lovers. Damon Johnson here, thrilled to share the news that recording starts THIS WEEK for yet another new album I’m planning to release in the summer/early fall of 2020.</p>
<p>Like we did with ‘Memoirs Of An Uprising’ two years ago, I’m calling on my amazing fan base to support a crowd-funding campaign to help this new effort become a reality. I’m looking forward to working with the staff at Indiegogo as my platform this time.</p>
<p>Most of you were there for me during my 2018 Pledge Music campaign, and everything about that experience was fantastic, inspiring, and humbling. You provided enough revenue that I was able to have my album recorded, mixed and mastered ultra pro; created stunning artwork and design for my vinyl and CD packaging; hire experienced professionals in various roles promoting my album.</p>
<p>Sadly, the final story with Pledge Music saw their bankruptcy and their theft of not only most of my revenue but thousands of dollars of other hard working independent artists’ money as well. But there was no way we (my family and I) were going to allow that debacle to deprive the hundreds of supporters that spent their hard earned cash to help me at the crucial moment of launching my solo career. We are certainly proud of the fact that all orders were filled and everyone received all the items that they purchased.</p>
<p>As Eddie Vedder sings, “I saw things so much clearer once you were in my rearview mirror”. We took out a loan, we put Pledge Music behind us quickly, and we soldiered on with over a year’s worth of tour dates, interviews, and private house concerts to spread the word about ‘Memoirs of An Uprising’. My touring profile has never been stronger, my streaming numbers on all the digital sites are into the tens of thousands on multiple tracks, and my back catalog is getting more attention now than it did when those albums were originally released. Translation: BIG success for ‘Memoirs Of An Uprising’ and Damon Johnson’s profile as a credible artist.</p>
<p>We’re going to have lots of fun with this new campaign! First, my friend and Grammy winning badass, Nick Raskulinecz, is going to produce my album this time (he only mixed ‘MOAU’). He and I worked together on Black Star Riders’ albums ‘The Killer Instinct’ and ‘Heavy Fire’, and those experiences sealed one has become one of the great friendships of my life. Nick is going to put the same amount of experience, love and care into my album as he has done for records by Alice In Chains, Rush, Foo Fighters, Mastadon, Halestorm, Evanescence, and many others. And during this Indiegogo campaign I’ll be sharing exclusive video footage from the studio, documenting the entire process of tracking drums, guitars, vocals, and ultimately the mixing of the tracks. You can only see it here!</p>
<p>We will be offering an even greater array of unique one-of-a-kind items this time, in addition to traditional things like pre-orders of vinyl and CD, personalized lyric sheets for songs of your choice, autographed guitars, guitar lessons, acoustic house concerts, and more. Lynda and the kids have going through my closet, yet again, and found some cool stuff that I would only part with for an effort such as this new album that I’m beyond thrilled to make.</p>
<p>Stay tuned here for more updates and info, and I look forward to communicating with all of you in one form or another. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Here we go!!!!</p>

<h3>WHO IS DANII??</h3>
<p>DANII is my music project and I am Brisbane-based singer-songwriter/musician/dancer/performer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY IS DANII DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER MUSICIAN??</h3>
<p>I want to inspire others to NEVER LET YOUR DISABILITY DISABLE YOU!</p>
<p>I am a 31 year old woman; living with a disability; who is a person of colour (POC);  trying to make a difference and stand out in an industry that believes that women over 30 are ""expired"", and is lacking in representing those that identify the same as I do.</p>
<p>Growing up and living with a disability, I have a unique perspective of the world and I always knew that I would have it so much harder trying to make a living and be 'normal'. But not for a second would I ever use my disability as an excuse to be complacent!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SO WHAT IS THE FUNDING FOR? </h3>
<p>Like most, my income has been affected because of COVID-19 both in my day job and side hustle aka music. If you have ever wondered why musicians are always 'struggling', here is an insight into my budget for this project and how I will spend the money;</p>
<p>- $2500 will help promote my next single and distribute across Australia for radio play and playlist submissions. Get that s**t viral!</p>
<p>- $500 for photoshoots for the single art cover</p>
<p>- $500 for song production, mixing and mastering to make the song release ready</p>
<p>- $6500 will help create a visual for this song! This song deserves a music video!</p>
<h3>WHAT DO I GET OUT OF IT?</h3>
<p>Ok so here's the thing; I get that we are living in a global pandemic. People are struggling and it feels wrong to ask people for money to help pursue my dream career.</p>
<p>But don't worry boo I gotchu - I wanna give back to you! I wanna give you something in return for your hard earned dollar! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>YOU ARE ASKING A LOT. WHAT ARE YOU CONTRIBUTING?!</h3>
<p>Good question! I am currently self-funding everything I do. And you will notice that I am not expecting the full budget. I simply just need a boost to help reach this goal.</p>
<p>If I reach my goal, great! If I don't, also great! If I blitz it, even better!</p>
<p>But I don't want this to be just about me either. If I can reach my intended goal by my intended date, then I will personally match 5% of the funds raised and donate to <a href=""https://www.curebraincancer.org.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cure Brain Cancer Foundation</a>. Last year I lost my dearest Lola to brain cancer and I want give back towards research of finding a cure.</p>
<h3>I REALLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DONATE RN. HOW ELSE CAN I HELP?</h3>

<h3>Aloha! Help us rebuild our home studio &amp; make music again! </h3>
<p>Thanks for tuning in! My name is Lani &amp; I'm an Asian American singer songwriter &amp; single mama who just got on the ballet for 15 awards in 7 categories for this year's 2021 Na Hoku Hanohano Awards, with my 4/20/20 3 album release, da HI Life, Vol I, II &amp; III (which are all on the ballot for Album of the Year ~ yay!). This campaign is to raise money to help me rebuild my home studio so I can record my next album, a reggae album, and level up the quality of my music videos and songs. <br/><br/>This campaign is really important to me because it will help me rebuild my music studio so that I can continue to focus my energy on creating quality music for my community during a time of great change &amp; turmoil. As a single mother, most of my time, energy &amp; resources go towards my children, and whatever is leftover is what I have. We live very humbly and I don't ask for much. I lost all of my music recording equipment &amp; gear when we had to evacuate from Pele's lava flow a few years ago, and now am down to only one ukulele and one guitar.<br/><br/>I have all the music, the songs, the beats, the talented local and international musicians who have agreed to bless this project all lined up &amp; ready to go !~ we just need some help getting musical &amp; recording equipment &amp; money to compensate these talented studio musicians to get started! <br/><br/>Please consider being an angel &amp; helping us on our journey to create more healing, soothing, beautiful music for our island &amp; our planet. Make a statement &amp; support your independent Asian American artists during this time of rampant anti~Asian racism ~ be the change you seek in this world! God bless you &amp; thank you for listening, and for your aloha. <br/><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown in more detail, dear:</p>
<p>Basically, I need anywhere from $3k-4k to fund the re~creation of my home studio and to help me record this next reggae album.  The costs are itemized in detail below. Most musicians ask for 20k for their album or even single fundraisers; however I'm not trying to milk you for more ~ I'm asking for the bare minimum, because as a single mama, I know how to stretch and budget and get things done with good quality at a fraction of the regular price, haha. I think this amount is totally achievable ~ if just 30 -50 people bless this project with $100 each, or if 10 generous &amp; music~loving folks simply act as patrons and support by providing for one of the items on the list below each, then it's done! <br/><br/>Specifically, what I need is: <br/><br/>* a new laptop with Logic Pro  ($1200)<br/>* 2 mics ($300)<br/>* speakers ($200)<br/>* amp ($500)<br/>* midi  ($200) <br/>* ukulele fix, mic stand &amp; wires ($200)<br/>* headphones ($100) <br/>* honorarium for musicians ($1k) <br/>* video camera ($500) </p>
<p>Here are some of the unique perks you'll get:<br/>* my complete discography (all my songs!) <br/>* a monthly membership where you see exclusive videos &amp; photos &amp; get recipes &amp; mantras<br/>* your name written in the liner notes and included in the thank you section of my next album and music video, and<br/>*  even a custom song and private acoustic concert for the most generous of Lani's angels!<br/><br/>ps ~ I am also open to doing sound healing workshops, creative writing workshops, yoga classes, guitar, ukulele &amp; voice workshops for patrons who donate $100 or more ~ just pm me and we'll talk~story details! </p>
<p>If we don't reach your entire goal, we will simply use what we have collected to get the most important &amp; necessary musical gear and build from there. Step by step, you can do anything, as my auntie says. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution, no matter how big or small, will make a big difference to this project, because you will be showing your very real support of an Asian American artist in a time of great anti~Asian sentiment in our country. </p>
<p>This project is valuable because it helps to amplify the voices of under~represented Asian American singers in our country and in helping our journey, you are a crucial and necessary part of the creative process. In the olden days, artists had patrons that supported them so they were able to create freely ~ by helping with this project, you are being a true patron of the arts. <br/><br/>Last year, on this same day (4/20/20) I simultaneously released 3 albums into the world, in the middle of a global crisis. I had no idea what would happen; I just put in the good work, because Work is Love. I am over the moon to announce that within this year, all three albums made the local and national news &amp; my songs were featured in music podcasts and music articles, I am thrilled that all 3 albums are currently in the running for Album of the Year for the 2021 Na Hoku Hanohano Awards. Three songs from those three albums are nominated for Song of the Year, and two are nominated for Instrumental Composition of the Year, and I am a nominee for Female Vocalist of the Year &amp; Most Promising Artist of the Year. <br/><br/>This recognition from the Na Hoku Hanohano Awards is a true blessing &amp; honor for me, my dears, and I hope &amp; pray that you trust that I will do my best to leave a beautiful legacy &amp; record of music for my children, and for our future generations. </p>

<h3><b><i>1,000 books needed, with high-quality photo-offset printing,

<p></p>This will be the 3rd edition of this <b>landmark collection</b> of Irish fiddle tunes. <b><i>Irish Traditional Fiddle Music</i></b>
 was originally published in three distinct volumes beginning in 1973 by
 Irish music enthusiasts Randy Miller and Jack Perron. Subsequently the 3
 volumes were combined and published in 1977. That 1st edition was 
updated and expanded in a 2nd edition, released by Randy Miller on St.

<p>The new edition will contain the original <b>clear and faithful settings</b>
 of 235 jigs, reels, hornpipes, polkas, slip jigs, and airs. Updated 
text will be added and the book will be printed on heftier paper stock

<p>Although
 the book is primarily edited with fiddle players in mind, it can very

 was originally published in three distinct volumes beginning in 1973 by
 Irish music enthusiasts Randy Miller and Jack Perron. Subsequently the 3
 volumes were combined and published in 1977. That 1st edition was 
updated and expanded in a 2nd edition, released by Randy Miller on St.

your help, a revised 3rd edition will be published early this fall!""Frankly, it's the best Irish tune collection issued for many a long year."" -Geoff Wallis, Musical Traditions e-zine (complete review here)

with Irish music. But the book is in danger of going out of

<h3>""<i>3:10 To Heaven</i>"" is the working title of the new recording project. No it's not a spriritual or gospel record but those elements have always been a part of my writing and that includes this album as well.</h3>
<h3>""3:10"" is an acoustic project that I'm very excited about. The songs are from my heart, my soul and from my life. I've been writing songs since I was 14 years old and that passion has only grown stronger with time. This will be my 6th studio album, all of which contain songs that I've written, and sharing those songs and these new songs is why I love to write.</h3>
<h3>Why ""3:10 To Heaven""?</h3>
<h3>Well, about a year ago I lost my Mom to a terrible disease, Alzheimer's. She put up a brave battle but eventually it got the better of her. Late one night the Lord came and took her home. The time of her passing was ""3:10""am. As we were riding home after being at the hospital, I asked my Dad about the time that she left us and he said ""3:10, 3:10 to Heaven."" Well by the time we got home I had most of the song written. And for the most part it stayed just the way I wrote it that night with very few changes. It became the focal point for this project.     </h3>
<h3>So that is how this project got started and why it's so important to me. I want to share her story and share the music that means so much to me...with YOU! If you can help with this recording it would mean so much to me and I know you will love these new songs. Your contribution would be an integral part of making this project come to life, and for that I THANK You!</h3>
<h3>The ""Perks"" of the Project!</h3>
<h3>We've set up some very unique, interesting and fun ""perks"" that you will receive in return for helping to make this project happen. From as simple as receiving a download copy of the new album to signed copies of the CD, house concerts and meet &amp; greets, right up to a corporate package with a full band performance of your choice. At each step along the way we're excited to interact with you and get to know you better, while at the same time you are helping so much and it's very much appreciated.</h3>
<h3>Where does the funding go?</h3>
<h3>Recording music and watching your songs come to life is an amazing, rewarding experience. But that process is very time consuming, expensive and involves a number of steps and help along the way. Studio time, a producer, musicians, graphic artists, etc and so much more. Your contribution will help to cover a portion of these costs. And that is such an important part to this whole process!</h3>
<h3>Reaching our goal is of great importance to us in making this project a reality. But in the event we don't quite reach that mark, this project <i>will proceed</i> and your contributions will help so much!</h3>
<h3>Helping to spread the word!</h3>

<h3>""3:10 to Heaven"" is a story just waiting to be told, let's tell it together. THANK YOU!</h3>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","""3:10 To Heaven"" is the working title of the new recording project. No it's not a spriritual or gospel record but those elements have always been a part of my writing and that includes this album as well.
""3:10"" is an acoustic project that I'm very excited about. The songs are from my heart, my soul and from my life. I've been writing songs since I was 14 years old and that passion has only grown stronger with time. This will be my 6th studio album, all of which contain songs that I've written, and sharing those songs and these new songs is why I love to write.
Why ""3:10 To Heaven""?
Well, about a year ago I lost my Mom to a terrible disease, Alzheimer's. She put up a brave battle but eventually it got the better of her. Late one night the Lord came and took her home. The time of her passing was ""3:10""am. As we were riding home after being at the hospital, I asked my Dad about the time that she left us and he said ""3:10, 3:10 to Heaven."" Well by the time we got home I had most of the song written. And for the most part it stayed just the way I wrote it that night with very few changes. It became the focal point for this project.     
So that is how this project got started and why it's so important to me. I want to share her story and share the music that means so much to me...with YOU! If you can help with this recording it would mean so much to me and I know you will love these new songs. Your contribution would be an integral part of making this project come to life, and for that I THANK You!
The ""Perks"" of the Project!
We've set up some very unique, interesting and fun ""perks"" that you will receive in return for helping to make this project happen. From as simple as receiving a download copy of the new album to signed copies of the CD, house concerts and meet & greets, right up to a corporate package with a full band performance of your choice. At each step along the way we're excited to interact with you and get to know you better, while at the same time you are helping so much and it's very much appreciated.
Where does the funding go?
Recording music and watching your songs come to life is an amazing, rewarding experience. But that process is very time consuming, expensive and involves a number of steps and help along the way. Studio time, a producer, musicians, graphic artists, etc and so much more. Your contribution will help to cover a portion of these costs. And that is such an important part to this whole process!
Reaching our goal is of great importance to us in making this project a reality. But in the event we don't quite reach that mark, this project will proceed and your contributions will help so much!
Helping to spread the word!
It would mean a lot to us if you could share this funding campaign with your friends. Be it on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to emails and contact lists.

""jazz-age and prohibition-era history lessons"" into our live shows,
providing interesting background stories with facts about 
individual songs,
artists, and writers.  Audiences who have experienced our

<p>Imagine being transported back in time to the roaring 1920s and 1930s “The Jazz
Era”.  The history of this American art form has always fascinated me as a
musician, artist, and student of jazz. I just need your help to make this dream
a reality and bring it to the people in person.</p><p><strong>Why This Project?</strong><br/></p><p>Growing up in the Washington DC area, I was fortunate
enough to hear this music played at home, on old records
and on the radio. My earliest experience singing in
public was at age five, when I sang a 1920s song at
a wedding.  I saw the magical effect this music had on everyone,
instantly bringing a smile to their faces. Naturally, I was hooked from
that moment on and decided I wanted to become a professional singer.  </p>
<p>Music literally saved my life.  Now, years later, I feel driven to pay homage to the artists and music that made it possible for me to
thrive throughout my life as a singer and working musician.  These recording projects celebrate the vibrant,
colorful history of the early jazz age that influenced my growth as an artist.  I selected an eclectic group of songs, most of
which are obscure gems from the 1920s and 30s, plus a few well- known
songs and originals based on this genre.  Many of these songs have been
long forgotten and lost to the public; and some have never before been re-recorded.  </p>

the right word to describe this recording and if you want sexy innuendos listen
to (Tropical) Heatwave or (I Want a Little) Sugar in My Bowl. If you look for
clever lyrics, you’ll find plenty here and you’ll chuckle at the witty

Donnay's voice could
make any classic material sound wondrous and timeless, but the fact that she
digs so deep into American musical history -- and works with some of the Bay
Area's top jazz musicians (under the guise of the Prohibition Mob Band) --
makes A Little Sugar not only sweet, but a recording that will stand the test
of time.- All Music Guide 2013
Once in awhile, a
talent comes along that’s an undeniable force of nature. Roberta Donnay, the
driving wheel behind Roberta Donnay and the Prohibition Mob Band, fits that
description. She’s currently on the road in support of her newest CD, “A Little
Sugar,” her uniquely hip tribute to Prohibition Era women singers and
songwriters. Dubbed ‘a rebel jazzer’ and given superlative marks by music
critics, Donnay was recently snapped up by Motema, the prestigious jazz and
blues label based out of Harlem in New York. – Music And More Arizona 2012
JAZZ WEEKLY: Roberta Donnay and
the Prohibition Mob Band: A Little Sugar More than musical
time travelling, Donnay makes music fun again. - George W. Harris
Donnay immerses
herself in the feminist sentiments of Roaring twenties and Depression Era women
jazz singers, and Donnay’s softer vocals take on a gritty edge even with songs
by Irving Berlin and Hoagy Carmichael. Woman empowerment, though tongue and
cheek on songs such as One Monkey Don’t Stop No Show come into play. Playful is
the right word to describe this recording and if you want sexy innuendos listen
to (Tropical) Heatwave or (I Want a Little) Sugar in My Bowl. If you look for
clever lyrics, you’ll find plenty here and you’ll chuckle at the witty
one-liners too. After listening to this CD, I feel like watching Hollywood classics, even Silent Era movies. – Whole Music
Expo  2012
DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE:
Sugar, Soul and MicrotonesRoberta Donnay, whose interpretive license is valid for both jazz and
blues, knows exactly how far she can go drawing inspiration from time-honored
singers like Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters and Ida Cox without sacrificing a sense
of self. 
Fronting her swinging Prohibition Mob Band (three horns plus rhythm section),
the Bay Area chanteuse resucitates a dozen chestnuts, among them ""You Go
To My Head"" (recall Billie Holiday's version) and ""Sugar Blues""
(well treated by Ella Fitzgerald)> Donnay's touch is firm and playfully coy,
her tonal control secure and her combination of silkiness and sensuality
effective in a meticulous, measured manner.

The album is going to be 14-18 songs deep with an official tracklisting coming soon!

I think there is something for everybody on this album.   Q: What exactly will your donation be used for you ask?  A: To pay for the cost of the physical albums themselves and for video production costs. With a minimum donation of $5 you will receive a FREE physical copy of ""Flu Piniella"" when it drops in August 2015.  The first three people to donate $20 or more will be invited to make a cameo in a future music video for this album. Anything and everything is appreciated and thank you for your time, as well as your generosity. - Craig Louie",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>(for english description scroll down) <br/></b></p><p><b>Wie alles begann / Die Idee</b><br/></p><p>Im Spätsommer
2014, während die LANGTUNES mehrere Wochen für die Produktion ihres Debütalbums
in Deutschland zu Gast waren, kam es zur ersten „Begegnung der dritten Art“. Elnaz Amiraslani, gebürtige Iranerin, Unterstützerin und Labelchefin der Musiker
arbeitet parallel mit der israelischen Band RAMZAILECH. </p><p>Schnell war die Idee geboren, die beiden exotischen Bands zusammen zu bringen. </p>
<p>Aufgrund des
großen Interesses an dem exklusiven Doppelkonzert wurde klar, dass es etwas
derartiges anscheinend noch nie gegeben hat. <br/>
Zum einen, weil ohnehin selten eine Indie-Band aus dem Iran die Möglichkeit
hat sich einem deutschen Publikum vorzustellen, aber auch weil die Heimatländer
beider Bands bekanntlich in tief verwurzelter Feindschaft zueinander stehen und
gesellschaftliche Schnittstellen zwischen beiden Kulturen vermeintlich nicht
ausgelebt werden können. </p>
<p>An diesem Abend
wurde ein kleines, aber hell strahlendes Licht für den Frieden entfacht. Warum ist es so unvorstellbar, dass sich junge Leute aus beiden Ländern
begegnen? Die Bands verstanden sich nicht nur auf Anhieb, sondern beschlossen auch ihre
sich entgegengestreckten Hände zu ergreifen und nicht mehr loszulassen.</p>
<p>Wir, also die
Musiker von LANGTUNES (Teheran), RAMZAILECH (Tel Aviv), das Label, Freunde und
Fans wollen nun mit dieser gemeinsamen Tour nicht nur ein Wiedersehen feiern,
sondern auch unser Zeichen für den Frieden hinaustragen. <br/>
Hinaus in die Welt, die den Glauben, dass Frieden einfach ist, so dringend
nötig hat. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>The Secret Handshake Tour / Warum
ausgerechnet in Deutschland?</b><br/></p><p>Deutschland
bietet uns den neutralen Boden, auf dem sich Menschen aller Länder und
Religionen frei begegnen können. Das bietet uns nicht nur die politische
Neutralität, um dieses Projekt umzusetzen zu können, sondern entspricht auch
unserem persönlichen Verständnis von Demokratie und Freiheit. <br/></p><p>
Außerdem haben wir schon bei unseren letzten Deutschland-Besuchen viele Freunde
und Fans gefunden, die wir auf unserer Tour zusammen bringen wollen. </p>
<p>Einen Monat
lang wollen wir quer durch Deutschland auf Tour gehen und damit nicht nur unsere
Musik in Eure Lieblings-Clubs bringen, sondern auch möglichst viele Menschen Teil
haben lassen an dieser einzigartigen Begegnung. Wir wollen ein gemeinsames
Zeichen setzen, dafür, dass Musik und die unvoreingenommene Jugend Grenzen
überwinden kann und Feindschaft nur in den Köpfen der Regierenden besteht. </p>
<p>Ohne Eure Hilfe
ist das nicht zu schaffen! Um zwei Bands mit komplettem Equipment einen Monat
lang durch die Republik zu fahren, müssen Flüge,<span>  Hotels, Verpflegung, Techniker, Tourbus usw.
bezahlt werden.</span></p>
<p>Wir wollen
ausdrücklich nicht um staatliche Unterstützung bitten, um die politische
Neutralität unseres Projekts zu wahren und uns nicht zum Werkzeug irgendwelcher
Interessen machen zu lassen.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Der Rest liegt bei Euch. Mit Eurem Beitrag macht ihr unseren und vielleicht
auch Euren Traum möglich - ein kleines Stück Weltfrieden zu schaffen! </b></span><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Das bekommt ihr von uns </b></p>
<p>Natürlich gibt
es für Eure Unterstützung jede Menge großartiger Belohnungen: <br/>
von Peace-Dealer-Buttons, CDs, riesigen Dankeschön-Paketen, bis hin zu ganz
privaten Begegnungen oder einem Konzert in Euren Wohnzimmern. </p>
<p>Hört uns zu und
lernt, wie einfach es ist Freunde zu sein. <br/>
Kommt auf unsere Konzerte und erlebt es selbst. </p>
<p>Und natürlich versprechen
wir Euch unvergessliche Konzertabende. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Und was dann?</b></p>
<p>Die Medien
überbieten sich darin, Ressentiments zu schüren und berichten gerne über den
Hass und die Dummheit der Menschen. Ganze Kontinente fliehen aus ihren Heimatländern, die in Brand gesetzt durch
diesen Hass keinen Platz zum Leben mehr bieten.</p><p>
Wir wollen mit unserem Projekt die Aufmerksamkeit der Medien aber auch darauf
lenken, dass eine ganze Generation die Grenzen, die so unerbittlich umkämpft
werden, bereits hinter sich gelassen hat. Junge Menschen in allen Ländern
träumen doch dieselben Träume, hören dieselbe Musik und lachen gemeinsam über
die Beschränktheit der sogenannten Staatsmänner. </p>
<p>Wir haben unser
Ziel sehr hoch gesteckt. Wir wollen, dass das hier groß wird. Jeder Euro von
Euch fließt direkt in unser Tour-Budget und macht es für uns überhaupt erst
möglich diesen Plan umzusetzen. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wir machen uns auf den Weg zu Euch, helft uns

<p><b>Geht das überhaupt?</b></p>
<p>Dass wir das
können haben wir schon bewiesen. Schon einmal standen wir jeglichen
Konsequenzen zum Trotz gemeinsam auf der Bühne und rockten uns einen Abend lang
in die Erinnerung einer Stadt.</p><p>Gerade LANGTUNES sind Experten darin das zu tun, was eigentlich nicht geht. Eine
Indie-Band in Teheran? Konzerttouren durch Deutschland, in Eigenregie? Ein
Album im Westen veröffentlichen? Genauso wenig glauben RAMZAILECH an die staatlich verordnete Feindschaft. <br/>
<br/>
Hört Euch unsere Geschichte an, um zu verstehen, wieviel Mut und Leidenschaft
nötig ist, das eigentlich Unmögliche zu tun und einem Traum immer weiter zu
folgen, gespannt wohin er einen führt. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Musik kann eine Welt nicht verändern heißt es, aber wir können zeigen wie einfach

<p>Kommt zu den
Konzerten und bringt Eure Freunde mit. Bleibt auf dem Laufenden. Erzählt die
Geschichte weiter. Helft uns unsere Nachricht hörbar zu machen. Glaubt nicht an
die Feindschaft der Religionen, Staaten und Nationen. Trefft Euresgleichen, auf

</p><p><b>How it all began</b></p>
<p>During the late summer of 2014, while
the LANGTUNES were in Germany for the production of their debut album the first
strange encouter came to place.<br/>
Elnaz Amiraslani, born in Iran, supporter and label owner of the musicians was
also dealing with the israeli band RAMZAILECh for a cooperation. <br/>
Pretty quickly the idea was born to bring the two exotic bands together.</p>
<p>The large response and interest in the
double-concert proved that nothing like this had existed before.<br/>
For one, having an iranian indie-band publicly tour through Germany was close
to never. In addition, combining these two specific bands together with their
national complex and deep polictical hostility avoid any cultural contact was
one of a kind.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>During this evening, a small light of
hope and peace came to kindled. Why is it so unimaginamble that young people
from both of these countries meet? Both bands did not only get along from the
beginning but also decided to reach out to a handshake and not let go.</p>
<p>We, the band Langtunes (from Teheran)
and Ramzailech (from Tel Aviv), the label, friends and fans would want not only
celebrate being together again but also set a clear sign for peace. Into the
world, we want to present how easy peace is to get. </p>
<p><b>The Secret Handshake Tour / Why in
Germany?</b></p>
<p>Germany gives us the neutral grounds
that we need where citizens from all over the world with various beliefs can
live freely and get into interaction. <br/>
It not only gives us the political neutral surroundings for this project but
also reflects our personal understanding of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>In addition, we have also won a fan
basis and friends during our last tour in Germany which we would like to bring together.
</p>
<p>For one whole month we want to tour
through Germany to not only bring our music to your favorite venue but also to
share our special collaboartion with as many people as possible. We want to set
an example and sign that music and the unbiased youth can overcome any boundary
and hostility that only exist in the heads of governments mainly. 
</p>
<p>Without your help, we cannot achieve
this! We need to rent equipment and a tourbus, pay flight-tickets, accomodations,
technicians, we need a promotiom-budget etc. </p>
<p>We specifically do not want to ask the
state to subsidize us to protect our politically neutral project and avoid
becoming instruments of certain interests.</p>
<p>It is now in you hands. With your support
you just might be able to make one of our, and perhaps your, dream come true -
to create a some world peace.</p>
<p><b>This is what you will get from us</b></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Of course you will recieve recognition
for your support with a great deal of rewards:<br/>
ranging from Peace-Dealer-Buttons, CDs, big Thank-You-Packages to a private
meeting with the band or even a private concert in your living room.</p>
<p>Listen to us and learn how easy it is to
become friends.<br/>
Come to our concerts and experience it for yourself.</p>
<p>Of course we also promise you an
unforgettable concert night. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><b>And then what?</b></p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The media is outdoing themselves in to
construct ressentment and always quick in  reporting about hate and
stupidity among people.<br/>
Whole continents are fleeing out of their home-countries that have been burnt
to the ground by hate making it impossible to live there.</p>
<p>With our project we also want to bring
the attention to the media to show that a whole generation exists that has
already left these borders behind them. Young people in all countries are
dreaming the same dreams, listening to the same music and are laughing together
at the so-called statesman.</p>
<p>We have set our goals very high. We want
this to be huge. Every Euro from you will flow directly into our tour-budget
and will make it possible for us to even start this plan. We will be on our way
to you. Help us!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is that even possible?</b></p>
<p>That it is possible has already been
proved. We have already stood together on stage despite any consequences and
rocked through the night in rememberance of a city.</p>
<p>The Langtunes especially are experts in
doing what is actually not possible. An indie-band from Teheran? Concert tour
through Germany on their own? Releasing an album in the west?</p>
<p>It is exactly the same with Ramzailech
who do not believe in the state directed hostility.</p>
<p>Listen to our story to understand how
much courage and passion it takes to do something impossible to follow a dream
and see where it can lead to.</p>
<p>Music cannot change the world they say,
but we can show how easy it is to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><b>What can you do?</b></p>
<p>Come to our concerts and bring your
friends. Stay informed. Tell the story to everyone you know. Help us get our
message heard. Do not believe in the enemies and hate between religions, states
and nations. Meet with like-minded people at the concerts and everywhere on the

How it all began
During the late summer of 2014, while
the LANGTUNES were in Germany for the production of their debut album the first
strange encouter came to place.
Elnaz Amiraslani, born in Iran, supporter and label owner of the musicians was
also dealing with the israeli band RAMZAILECh for a cooperation. 
Pretty quickly the idea was born to bring the two exotic bands together.
The large response and interest in the
double-concert proved that nothing like this had existed before.
For one, having an iranian indie-band publicly tour through Germany was close
to never. In addition, combining these two specific bands together with their
national complex and deep polictical hostility avoid any cultural contact was
one of a kind.
  
During this evening, a small light of
hope and peace came to kindled. Why is it so unimaginamble that young people
from both of these countries meet? Both bands did not only get along from the
beginning but also decided to reach out to a handshake and not let go.
We, the band Langtunes (from Teheran)
and Ramzailech (from Tel Aviv), the label, friends and fans would want not only
celebrate being together again but also set a clear sign for peace. Into the
world, we want to present how easy peace is to get. 
The Secret Handshake Tour / Why in
Germany?
Germany gives us the neutral grounds
that we need where citizens from all over the world with various beliefs can
live freely and get into interaction. 
It not only gives us the political neutral surroundings for this project but
also reflects our personal understanding of freedom and democracy.
In addition, we have also won a fan
basis and friends during our last tour in Germany which we would like to bring together.

For one whole month we want to tour
through Germany to not only bring our music to your favorite venue but also to
share our special collaboartion with as many people as possible. We want to set
an example and sign that music and the unbiased youth can overcome any boundary
and hostility that only exist in the heads of governments mainly. 

Without your help, we cannot achieve
this! We need to rent equipment and a tourbus, pay flight-tickets, accomodations,
technicians, we need a promotiom-budget etc. 
We specifically do not want to ask the
state to subsidize us to protect our politically neutral project and avoid
becoming instruments of certain interests.
It is now in you hands. With your support
you just might be able to make one of our, and perhaps your, dream come true -
to create a some world peace.
This is what you will get from us
  
Of course you will recieve recognition
for your support with a great deal of rewards:
ranging from Peace-Dealer-Buttons, CDs, big Thank-You-Packages to a private
meeting with the band or even a private concert in your living room.
Listen to us and learn how easy it is to
become friends.
Come to our concerts and experience it for yourself.
Of course we also promise you an
unforgettable concert night. 
  
And then what?
  
The media is outdoing themselves in to
construct ressentment and always quick in  reporting about hate and
stupidity among people.
Whole continents are fleeing out of their home-countries that have been burnt
to the ground by hate making it impossible to live there.
With our project we also want to bring
the attention to the media to show that a whole generation exists that has
already left these borders behind them. Young people in all countries are
dreaming the same dreams, listening to the same music and are laughing together
at the so-called statesman.
We have set our goals very high. We want
this to be huge. Every Euro from you will flow directly into our tour-budget
and will make it possible for us to even start this plan. We will be on our way
to you. Help us!

Is that even possible?
That it is possible has already been
proved. We have already stood together on stage despite any consequences and
rocked through the night in rememberance of a city.
The Langtunes especially are experts in
doing what is actually not possible. An indie-band from Teheran? Concert tour
through Germany on their own? Releasing an album in the west?
It is exactly the same with Ramzailech
who do not believe in the state directed hostility.
Listen to our story to understand how
much courage and passion it takes to do something impossible to follow a dream
and see where it can lead to.
Music cannot change the world they say,
but we can show how easy it is to make the world a better place.
What can you do?
Come to our concerts and bring your
friends. Stay informed. Tell the story to everyone you know. Help us get our
message heard. Do not believe in the enemies and hate between religions, states
and nations. Meet with like-minded people at the concerts and everywhere on the
net from all over the world.

</h3>Ever since we've formed as a band, we've wanted to do a live release because we feel that's who we are as a band.  Up until this point, we haven't had the time or resources in order to do this.  However, we have been presented with an opportunity from New Vine Media to help us create this project and we are stoked!<br/><br/>
</div> <div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We're asking for $10,000 in order to fully fund this project.<br/>Here's a couple of key reasons that we're asking for this amount specifically:<br/><ul>
<li>New Vine Media is bringing Matt Goldman from Glow In The Dark Studios in Atlanta to help record this live EP.</li>
<li>New Vine Media will be renting a few RED cameras (some of the best cameras in the business) in order to capture video for the night of the recording.</li>
<li>We'll need money to replicate this project in order to get physical copies in peoples hands that order them through the perks.</li>
<li>The remaining money will go towards merchandise for this project such as shirts and other things we'll have for sale as well as other production costs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>It's pretty simple!  We believe this investment can and will effectively proclaim the greatness and majesty of God.  When you support something like this you are not only getting a great  experience, but are taking part in proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the nations.  One of the biggest reasons we wanted to use video is because, let's face it, most everyone is looking at their phones and tablets to watch videos and listen to music these days.  And again, with this EP/DVD, we'll have opportunity to not only put this on sites like YouTube and other video streaming sites, but also international television around the world.  This opportunity is amazing and we are so thankful for it, but ultimately, we want to use this not just as another release, but as a unique opportunity for us to use Live Recordings and Video to promote the spread of the gospel and worshiping in spirit and truth to the King of all kings.  <br/>

<p>Hello,</p><p>My name is Vasko and  I am 12 years old. This year  I auditioned at Mannes Prep  in NYC  <a href=""http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/prep/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.newschool.edu/mannes/prep/</a>
and I have been accepted in the piano pre-senior program. I believe in Mannes I
can accomplish great achievements and learn much more than I ever have learned
before. With the program I will be engaged in a professional environment. I
will also have various performing opportunities. The program will also provide
the opportunity to learn from a great music and have master classes with
remarkable piano teachers. </p>
<p>I started piano lessons when I was four and a half years old. At
this time my family and I had no intention of learning piano professionally. It
was two years later that I decided I wanted professional teaching so I could
develop a career when I grow up. By this time I wanted to become a concert
pianist. Classical music is very relaxing and I love the beautiful melodies in
every song. I sometimes listen to classical music when I'm doing homework
because it helps me concentrate more. So far I've played in many concerts but
my greatest achievement was when I won the first place in the Rondo Young
Artist competition. My reward was the chance to play in Carnegie Hall. Here I
played, Sonata in F major by Beethoven and Study in E minor by Bertini. </p>
<p>Mannes might be a choice of a
lifetime and I would be really happy to have the chance to participate in this
professional program. Another benefit of being in the program is that I would
have access to Steinway pianos. I am willing to do all the hard work that it
will take to participate in this program. I believe the Mannes can make <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">me a better

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If I succeed, I'm going to release at least <b>SIX new tracks in 2015 and 2016</b>: one every two months.

<div>Alright, if I need <b>money to free up my time</b>, what will I spend my time for? First of all, <b>music</b>.

Finally, I need <b>2 weeks</b> to mix acapella with instrumental, finalize, mix and master whole track and make a graphics for a single. <b>Everything has to be perfect</b> and reviewed lots of times! But it does not take 24 hours per day of course. At the same time of music making I will <b>improve my vocal skills</b>: rehearsals in a studio 3 days a week for 3 hours. It will cost about $720. At the same time I have to do a lot of <b>infrastructure work</b>: renew and update spreadvibes.com, make a good Spread Vibes Shop, constantly update information on social networks and let you know what's going on, increase my fan base, work on advertising and internet radio, to monitor how's everything going and to <b>spread the world</b>.</div>

</div></div>","Spread Vibes is an alternative rock mixed with cool electronics music project from Russia (I hope, you are not concerned about political issues) created in 2010 and running by me (Vladimir Smirnov) only. I'm making music for 7 years already and, you know, it owned me almost instantly. I can't even imagine my life without music. As I'm doing everything by my own, it takes a huge amount of effort and time. I want to keep moving forward and improve my skills, that's why I need your help!
I don't really have a big fan base or friends and family support, so if you can, please contribute now! The future of Spread Vibes really depends on your action. 

What is One Year of Spread Vibes?
An idea is pretty simple: I need $5000 to make music whole next year without thinking about how to make money, so I'll have a plenty of time for creation process. Past couple of years I have put a lot of time and effort to earn money from the internet and I thought it will work for me and my music, but it's not. It still takes a lot of time to continuously gain necessary funds just for living. Now there is financial crisis in Russia, sales dropped and it seems, there is no escape from financial instability except crowdfunding and your help!


I need One Year of Spread Vibes campaign to bring my music on stage (to perform live) with a great success. And to do that I need money to free up my time and to make more songs, I need a band, I need a bigger community and I need more people who would like to help me! This campaign and whole next year is a real opportunity to make Spread Vibes live.


What do I need $5000 for?
$5000 is just enough to reach my needs: to rent an apartment, to eat and drink, to free up my time to make music and practice a lot. All costs for material prizes and shipping will be spent from my current budget.  

If I succeed, I'm going to release at least SIX new tracks in 2015 and 2016: one every two months. Every track will be a unique, fresh and modern piece of music. Probably more, but six for sure. Please, keep in mind, that I'm doing everything from scratch by myself and everything has to be perfect, that's why it takes so long. In 2014 I released three tracks: Believe In Me, Power and Information War. 

$5000 is a minimum. I need extra money for a better equipment (microphone, midi keyboard and better camcorder will cost about $1000) and for promotion purposes, because promotion is really a 50% of success, it's very important. So if I'll raise more than $5000, it would be great! I will definitely increase quality and improve content of my music videos.

Time = money
Alright, if I need money to free up my time, what will I spend my time for? First of all, music. From my experience, I need about 4 weeks to make perfect instrumental and write lyrics for a song. Then it goes vocal rehearsal process that takes about 2 weeks and acapella recording in one day as a result. Finally, I need 2 weeks to mix acapella with instrumental, finalize, mix and master whole track and make a graphics for a single. Everything has to be perfect and reviewed lots of times! But it does not take 24 hours per day of course. At the same time of music making I will improve my vocal skills: rehearsals in a studio 3 days a week for 3 hours. It will cost about $720. At the same time I have to do a lot of infrastructure work: renew and update spreadvibes.com, make a good Spread Vibes Shop, constantly update information on social networks and let you know what's going on, increase my fan base, work on advertising and internet radio, to monitor how's everything going and to spread the world.

What you get?
I can't give you a lot of physical stuff like merch or something (shipping also costs), but I can make something more special like giving you an experience of how music is making, to make you really a big part of something awesome and to offer a lot of personal gratitude!
I think that the most interesting perk for you and me is Collaboration! It will be a very unique experience, because you can actually be a part of my music and I can actually work directly with you!
Each physical CD you choose will be signed and shipped carefully! I'm taking full responsibility for it's content and quality, as well as for shipping issues.
I'm sure that our Skype chats will be also memorable for both us! It will go in positive way, and as a result we could know and understand each other better.
If I don't reach $5000, I'm not going to give up! Music is already a big part of my life and would definitely be. For sure, I will find time and power to keep moving, but with your help I can reach my goal way faster. Subscriptions for three or six tracks will be valid until I'll make them. As well as collaboration perks. Lifetime warranty.

<p>I'm
Satyakam Mohkamsing a Violinist trained in Indian Music and World Fusion, my
goal is to help the world through art, by sharing my thought: ""seeing life
in terms of music"" through the voice of my violin.<br/>
<br/>
Born in New Dehli raised in the Netherlands, I started playing violin at age of
seven in Varanasi in India under guidance of Satyaprakasa Mohanty, when I
returned to the Netherlands Lenneke van Staalen became my violin teacher for
many years. In 2004 I moved to Surinam where I continued my training of Indian
music at the Indian Cultural Centre under V. K. Sambyal and Rita Bokil.
Returning back to the Netherlands in 2006 I went to the World Music
Conservatory where I studied under guidance of Lenneke van Staalen,  pt.
Dhruba Ghosh and pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia. During my study at the conservatory
I combined my musical education in India as well where I was privileged to
learn also from dr. N. Rajam. In 2012 I graduated at the conservatory for my
MA, since then I kept travelling yearly to India to expand my musical
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
By the age of ten, started performing on stage. Since then I have appeared at
several music venues in various countries in Europe, India and South America as
solist and with several fusion ensembles.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1137820/files/20150108030751-Satyakam-nu-toen11.png?1420715271"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3>Goal</h3>
My goal is that I can share my musical thoughts with the world how I see
""life in terms of music"" through the voice of my violin. This happens
most of all on stage through the live performance but the album can be listened
to whenever and ofcourse shared whenever. <br/>
So my goal is to record and launch my album, this goal can be accomplished with
your support in many ways!<br/><br/><div>

</div></div>","Hi!
I'm
Satyakam Mohkamsing a Violinist trained in Indian Music and World Fusion, my
goal is to help the world through art, by sharing my thought: ""seeing life
in terms of music"" through the voice of my violin.

Born in New Dehli raised in the Netherlands, I started playing violin at age of
seven in Varanasi in India under guidance of Satyaprakasa Mohanty, when I
returned to the Netherlands Lenneke van Staalen became my violin teacher for
many years. In 2004 I moved to Surinam where I continued my training of Indian
music at the Indian Cultural Centre under V. K. Sambyal and Rita Bokil.
Returning back to the Netherlands in 2006 I went to the World Music
Conservatory where I studied under guidance of Lenneke van Staalen,  pt.
Dhruba Ghosh and pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia. During my study at the conservatory
I combined my musical education in India as well where I was privileged to
learn also from dr. N. Rajam. In 2012 I graduated at the conservatory for my
MA, since then I kept travelling yearly to India to expand my musical
knowledge.

By the age of ten, started performing on stage. Since then I have appeared at
several music venues in various countries in Europe, India and South America as
solist and with several fusion ensembles.
Goal
My goal is that I can share my musical thoughts with the world how I see
""life in terms of music"" through the voice of my violin. This happens
most of all on stage through the live performance but the album can be listened
to whenever and ofcourse shared whenever. 
So my goal is to record and launch my album, this goal can be accomplished with
your support in many ways!

It was always my dream to record an album in America having grown up listening to Carole King, James Taylor, Lionel Richie and the Eagles.<br/><br/>I first started coming to the States after meeting L.A. based singer songwriter Karen Nash. Karen's husband Bob Malone introduced me to engineer/producer Steve McDonald who invited me to co-produce my new album with him in Los Angeles and suddenly I saw my dream coming true! <br/></p>
<p>I now have 12 tracks ready to mix, master, press, print and promote. I am so excited and can’t wait to get this album out to you.

<p>I’ve been collaborating and working with different artist
and musicians throughout the years and now it’s time to finish and release this
album <b>‘To Kill a Fool’</b>. I started working on it about 4 years ago, In the
beginning I thought I would finish the project in a couple of years, but as we
all know there are times when we have no control over things.  About a year into it I became very ill and
was hospitalized for three weeks.  I
finally was able to get back on my feet but realized how far back this put the
project. I lost my “regular” job that would have helped fund it, and my dream
was now on hold with me not knowing if it would ever emerge.  I did not have the funds and quite honestly
the strength to continue.  But…. the
thing about dreams is, that, they never really leave you.  Dreams stay alive in us and we can either
continue fighting hard to make them come true or we can just let them go.  This album is exactly about that. It’s about embracing life and conquering
fear, it’s about letting go and moving on.</p>

of the record. This album is going to be mixed by the same engineer that did
my first record (<b>EDYEPI</b>)  <b>Bob St. John </b>         <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span><a href=""http://bobstjohn.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">bobstjohn.com</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> (Duran Duran, Extreme, Collective Soul) I’ve known Bob for more than 15 years and he’s not only a
producer and mixing engineer, he is a true fan of music and great songwriting,
it’s always a pleasure and an honor to work with him. Also, part of the money
is going into buying recording equipment and studio time and will also help me finish the
artwork and the cover for the record which I’m working on. </span></p>

haven’t put it down ever since. In 2003 I released my first album ‘EDYEPI’ (El
Diablo y El Payaso Infeliz) (The Devil And The Unhappy Clown) and the first
single ‘Que Bien’ got a lot of airplay in Alfa Rock 105.7 a well known rock
station in Puerto Rico. 




   






I’ve been collaborating and working with different artist
and musicians throughout the years and now it’s time to finish and release this
album ‘To Kill a Fool’. I started working on it about 4 years ago, In the
beginning I thought I would finish the project in a couple of years, but as we
all know there are times when we have no control over things.  About a year into it I became very ill and
was hospitalized for three weeks.  I
finally was able to get back on my feet but realized how far back this put the
project. I lost my “regular” job that would have helped fund it, and my dream
was now on hold with me not knowing if it would ever emerge.  I did not have the funds and quite honestly
the strength to continue.  But…. the
thing about dreams is, that, they never really leave you.  Dreams stay alive in us and we can either
continue fighting hard to make them come true or we can just let them go.  This album is exactly about that. It’s about embracing life and conquering
fear, it’s about letting go and moving on.



All of the funds...
Will help me with the mixing and mastering
of the record. This album is going to be mixed by the same engineer that did
my first record (EDYEPI)  Bob St. John           bobstjohn.com (Duran Duran, Extreme, Collective Soul) I’ve known Bob for more than 15 years and he’s not only a
producer and mixing engineer, he is a true fan of music and great songwriting,
it’s always a pleasure and an honor to work with him. Also, part of the money
is going into buying recording equipment and studio time and will also help me finish the
artwork and the cover for the record which I’m working on. 





And speaking about artwork...


Another passion of mine is painting, I started taking it seriously about 10 years ago and I have been blessed to have some of my work displayed in numerous galleries in Puerto Rico, Texas, Oklahoma and Miami. You will see that some of the PERKS will not only include music downloads but you will also have the opportunity to own a signed print of the cover for 'To Kill a Fool' and an original oil painting. I've uploaded photos of all 12 pieces, just click on the Gallery tab on top of the campaign video for more info...

 Motion began in 2012 when Berklee College of Music student Kevin Andrew
 Clark returned from India with new spiritual and creative aspirations. 
As Clark puts it, ""I had a vision of creating music with only the 
movement of my body; an entire orchestra within me. I knew it was 
possible and I needed to find out how.""<br/><br/>Soon after, Clark created
 a ""skin-and-bones"" prototype using the Xbox Kinect and open source 
coding developed by Ryan Challinor. <br/><br/>With this, he was able to create a 
number of musical pieces which helped solidify his vision of Point 
Motion’s potential; so, he established Golden Wish LLC in Massachusetts.
 <br/><br/>Clark spent the next 3 years finishing his studies as a Jazz 
Composition/Film Scoring major, applying for Patents, and continuing to 
develop Point Motion (Then only known as ""Puppet Master"").<br/><br/>Upon graduating in May 2015, Clark set his 
focus on bringing Point Motion to people around the world. After meeting many people who would help 
him further his vision; Clark finally connected with Tufts graduate and 
""Programming Prodigy"" Chris Penny. <br/><br/><br/>The two saw the potential for a 
system that only used 2D cameras as a controller and that allows anyone 
to access this technology. Along with the rest of the Golden Wish team, 
they have since worked together in bringing Point Motion to fruition by 
partnering with Extreme Reality and Boston Engineering to create the 
first universal and completely wireless motion-control instrument.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463422224/whats_next2_q1dwfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>FAQ's<br/><br/></b><i>1. What makes Point Motion different from the other Gesture devices out of the market?</i><br/><br/>Every gesture control device that exists continues to give the user the 
same games and home theater controls. However, they have yet to 
explore the deeper possibilities of gesture tracking technology as a 
creative tool. Point Motion will open a new realm for creative 
experiences and self expression that no device has offered before. <br/><br/><i>2. What is the difference between using Point Motion applications with a 
laptop camera and using them with the Point Motion Controller?<br/></i><br/>The Point Motion Controller is specifically optimized to capture the 
most accurate movements at the fastest rate. It is designed to recognize
 specific movements in any type of environment. By using the versatile 
Point Motion Controller, any space becomes a creative space.<i><br/><br/>3. What does the Point Motion Controller do?<br/></i><br/>The Point Motion Controller will allow you to use your Point Motion apps
 in the most effective manner. You can place your camera anywhere in 
your room and easily access any changes to your sound pallet on either 
your computer or phone. The controller also allows you to collaborate. 
One user can modify the features in the app while another is moving in 
front of their Point Motion Controller. <br/><br/><i>4. Can I use Point Motion along with my other music equipment?<br/><br/></i>Just like any major audio recording application, our Puppet Master app 
allows users to create with their own instruments and voices. Hook up 
your guitars, beat on your drums, or sing to your hearts content; Puppet
 Master will help you maximize the potential of all your instruments.<i><br/><br/>5. Will there be outside developers working on apps for Point Motion? Could I get my hands on the API?<br/><br/></i>Initially, we will be developing our apps within our own team to keep 
the vision focused on what our users want. Once users have had the time 
to understand Point Motion’s capabilities and potential, we will open 
the doors for them to contribute to this revolutionary instrument with 
user-developed apps. <i><br/><br/>6. What kind of sounds will I get in my sound library?<br/><br/></i>Our sound library consists of hundreds of beats, samples, loops, and 
effects for you to manipulate and activate at your will. We also include
 dozens of original songs from professional recording artists for you 
to remix and experience, and classic songs to interpret such as Bach, Beethoven and Chopin.<i><br/><br/>7. I’m an artist and want to create something completely original; can I 
create my own sounds or control instruments rather than pre-loaded 
sounds/loops?<br/></i><br/>Absolutely. While Point Motion gives amateur musicians the ability to 
create and alter templates from our Sound Pack, we also give the more 
experienced musicians the utmost control to create freely from any 
restriction. Set your own loops, sounds, effects, and instruments with 
custom motion-activated key swipes. You can choose what movements will 
trigger what effects, giving you complete control over your sound and 
movement. <i><br/><br/>8. Can I record what I create?<br/><br/></i>Of course! Although you don’t have to, we make sure you have the 
ability to record your creations. You can upload them directly to social
 media or share them with us in our community forum on our website.<br/><br/><i>9. How hard is it to use? I have no rhythm...<br/><br/></i>First off, everyone has rhythm. Point Motion conforms to any style of 
movement, giving ""inexperienced"" users the same freedom and flexibility 
to create music with as much or as little assistance as needed.<i><br/><br/>10. What if I want to use specific moves as commands?<br/><br/></i>You will be able to customize and designate movements to signal any 
chain of effects or sounds. This facilitates users with limited mobility
 to personalize their creation. <br/><br/><i>11. Is there a warranty?</i><br/><i><br/></i>If your Point Motion system does not work as advertised, simply send it 
back to us, and we will refund you for the full amount. This warranty 
covers all technical issues for one year, free of charge.<i><br/><br/>12. Can it track more than one person?</i><i><br/><br/></i><i><i>E<i>ach controller can track one person at a time. The compromise for this with our first release, is that if each person is using their own app or Point Motion Controller, they can collaborate musically on separate units.<br/><br/>13. Do I have to wear any special clothes?<br/><br/>The more clearly defined you are from the background, the better. Your 
Point Motion Controller tracks the most effectively when you are well 
lit and wearing solid colors. Lighting and glare also affect the ability of your Point Motion App to track your movement. For optimized performance, make sure the background behind the user is a solid color contrasting to the user's clothes. <br/><br/>14. How much will it cost once released?<br/><br/><ul>
<li>The MSRP of our Point Motion Controller will be $299 + Tax</li>

WHO AM I
  I am Jordan Williams aka Jordan Gonzaga (formerly known Kid Mufasa). Im a HIPHOP/RNB artist, but I am passionate about all music and art. I grew up playing in various Pop Punk and Metal bands.  Couch Surfing was never the ideal way of living, nor is being in and out of the streets, but I chose to move out of my small town in southern Alberta at 16 years old to Calgary, Alberta. I had roommates to learn from, and took what ever piece of mind I could comprehend from society at that point, I've watched a lot pass me by, from love, home, comfortability to the dark sides of poverty, in turn facing homelessness along with emotional baggage, holding on to very little but the music. The impact that this whole 10 year experience has lead me to is further questions of Passion, love, unity, and self understanding, through exploring creative arts and ""right-brained"" outlets. 


IMPORTANCE
 Love, Unity, and Self Exploration. The album ""KNOW LOVE"" will be expressing these four ideas into tangible, relevant, and real concepts that can make such expressions a ""Hot Topic"", more so in HipHop and Rap music as its a very competitive lifestyle/genre. It is very important to me to express to as wide of an audience as possible that positive expression, unity/collaboration with good intentions is ok to.

CONTRIBUTORS

 As all of this is nearly impossible without the help from contributors and donations, the importance of you is as important as the music. Your investments will help start a cycle of giving back to the community on a musical and artistic level, further inspiring the movement.



THE BUSINESSY PART...
This is my least favorite discussion, but is essential to making this happen. Two things I need from you. 


SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT
$7000 CAD (GOAL)

Your support will help me make a positive wave of change in a mainstream sub culture that promotes misogynists and chauvinism, guiding our views on each other and encouraging toxic behaviors and habits. By making that wave we can essentially be the tide that cleans up the mess that has been made media wise.
The $7000 dollars will go towards the production and recording of the album, along with a music video for the single #NOSTRESS. The album will have 8 tracks and include features from guest artists. Here is a precise list of expenses involved in this project.



Recording - This will involve Studio Time and Engineer

Production- Work with the producer (Beat Making/Artist Building)

Collaborations- Artists such as Christian Hudson ( 2015 Stampede Talent Search Grand Prize Winner) Mariya Stokes (International Award Winning Modern Country Song Writer)

Distribution- Online distribution exp. Download Cards registration fees etc.

</div><p></p><p></p><p>Dear Friends and Friends we’ve yet to meet,</p>
<p>For the last 14 years we have traveled over 650,000 miles of North American highways performing original compositions under the name Tangled Blue. We’ve traveled coast to coast many times and two weeks ago we moved to New Orleans for this next song writing project. We are also self described “Church Nerds” and “Liturgi-geeks”. <b>We love church music!</b> It is the rhyme and rhythm of our faith journeys, and writing a song that is both musically memorable and theologically deep is hard work. In the NOLA Liturgy Project we are striving to create tunes that are that good balance of words, story, and melody based in a specific time, place, and culture with the theological depth and musical energy to transcend that time and place. </p>
<p>We’re not doing this work alone. We have a number of partners in and around New Orleans. St. Paul Lutheran Church and School in the Marigny, Gethsemane Lutheran Church in Chalmette, LINCNewOrleans, Urban Impact New Orleans, The Thrivent Financial representative Terry King, and a number of individual New Orleanians have all played a role in bringing us this far have already pledged over $13,000 toward this project. <b>We need your help to bring the project home.</b> </p>
<p>Your pledge to support the NOLA liturgy project will help us pay local musicians for their contributions, record and duplicate the master recording, and prepare the musical scores for congregations to utilize.

</div></div>","Dear Friends and Friends we’ve yet to meet,
For the last 14 years we have traveled over 650,000 miles of North American highways performing original compositions under the name Tangled Blue. We’ve traveled coast to coast many times and two weeks ago we moved to New Orleans for this next song writing project. We are also self described “Church Nerds” and “Liturgi-geeks”. We love church music! It is the rhyme and rhythm of our faith journeys, and writing a song that is both musically memorable and theologically deep is hard work. In the NOLA Liturgy Project we are striving to create tunes that are that good balance of words, story, and melody based in a specific time, place, and culture with the theological depth and musical energy to transcend that time and place. 
We’re not doing this work alone. We have a number of partners in and around New Orleans. St. Paul Lutheran Church and School in the Marigny, Gethsemane Lutheran Church in Chalmette, LINCNewOrleans, Urban Impact New Orleans, The Thrivent Financial representative Terry King, and a number of individual New Orleanians have all played a role in bringing us this far have already pledged over $13,000 toward this project. We need your help to bring the project home. 
Your pledge to support the NOLA liturgy project will help us pay local musicians for their contributions, record and duplicate the master recording, and prepare the musical scores for congregations to utilize. Your financial gift will also allow us to commit more time in the city over the next six months so we can absorb the sounds of New Orleans and partner with the community to create a unique and authentic work of art. 
Please join us in this important work! Look to the right for the perks we can offer as a way to say thank you for your patronage and support...
Our overall fundraising goal for the NOLA Liturgy Project is $28,000. We’ve already raised $13,000 through our partners in New Orleans, and we expect to have a few more partners join us in the coming months. Not all of the remaining $15,000 needs to come through this Indiegogo campaign, but we certainly won’t turn any support away! Should we meet our fundraising goals here is how these funds will be utilized:
$10,000 for project development, meeting, creating, and rehearsing music that fits this community!
$10,000 creation of the recording and paying NOLA musicians involved in the recording.

$2,000 duplication of the recording to get the work into ears of folks across the globe.
$2,000 creation of piano, lead, and congregational scores.
$1,000 creation of a new web site for Tangled Blue’s liturgical settings
$1,000 promotion of the work via online, social, and traditional media.
Thanks for your time, support, and consideration! We know that we have a lot of listeners and friends who may not be able to make a financial contribution to this project. We’d still like you to be part of the process.

You name it, we've done it. All construction work so far has been carried out by us, working day and night, and the fruits of our labour have paid off as we opened our first rehearsal room at the beginning of August, to rave reviews from all that have used it. We even had to design and build the studio doors as off-the-shelf doors just don't meet up to the acoustical or quality standards we are aiming to achieve. But the quality of the new room is second to none, and we are confident that the only point on which some of the high end London facilities would beat us would be on the size. </p><p>To afford to build the rest of the studio, we need at least £10,000, enabling us to buy the materials needed to construct the rooms and appropriate acoustic treatments. None of this will be spent on labour costs (due to self-building) and our equipment such as the mixing desk and monitors will be transferred from the old studio. £10,000 is a very tight squeeze for the quality of work we are trying to achieve, but we KNOW we can make it work. If we can build the control room using this, we can start to get some money in from recordings, mixing sessions and more, therefore giving us the money to build the next room.</p><p><strong>What Happens If We Don't Get Enough Money</strong></p><p>If we unfortunately do not receive the full £10,000 we need to complete the remaining two thirds is the studio, we face a very long and slow process to complete it.

This is because by building the studio using only our own funds, which are quickly diminishing, we have to rely on what little income we can gather through other work. That massively impacts the time we can put into the build. If we had the full sum of money we require, we can build the studio in a much shorter time scale - getting us up and running, and bringing the music back to our customers.</p><p>Our old studio had a reputation for producing only the best, at a price the everyday punter could afford. We know that when this new studio is completed, we can only go bigger and better, bringing in more of the best music clients and creating what they want to hear, and all whilst keeping the same value for money we offered in our old location.</p><p>Such a devotion to the music industry is what makes the studio work. All day, every day. Bringing quality to today's music world.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Of course there would never be any sort of business that runs without risk. Risk is what keeps us pumping with the adrenaline we need to carry on!</p><p>But on a serious note, running a business such as ours is never predictable and one day we may have bookings from 7am until midnight, other days we may be completely empty.</p><p>We can't tell how the future will go, but we know that with the vision we have for the future of our business and with the determination we have, and with our track record, our chances of success are good.</p><p>There is always the risk of running out of money before you are up and running sufficiently to break even. This is the situation we are in now. Our rent goes out every month, electricity bills, business rates and much more, and our small pool of money is slowly shrinking. This is the reason for creating a crowdfunding campaign, in the hope that you can help us to achieve our goal and that, by return, we can help you to achieve your musical goals. </p><p>With the £10,000 we need, we will be able to open the studio with enough money to do it properly and on schedule.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you can't donate to our cause, you can still help! Publicity is key when trying to do something like this, and with the rise of social media, it's now easier than ever.</p><p>Why don't you share it on Facebook, Tweet it, Instagram, YouTube, you name it! Every time you post something about our cause, such as sharing this crowdfunding campaign online to your friends and family, it helps us to become more known to the community and gives us a better chance at success.</p><p>There's even built-in share tools on Indiegogo.com so you don't have to waste any time messing around with apps and emails!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So if you can help us and you feel like making a difference to two incredibly dedicated, customer focused and music-obsessed business owners, and you feel you can help us turn what was originally a bad situation into an unbeatable facility for anyone and everyone to use and you feel like joining the Cosmic Audio family, please please donate to us and we promise to you that it will be worth your investment. We have kept our business targets realistic, we have affordable premises, and we have that vision and plan. But the rising cost of materials, and the huge and unexpected cost of moving from our old premises has left us only just enough money to complete our first rehearsal room. And income from one room won't enable us to break even - so we need to get the rest of the studio built as quickly as possible in order to survive. With YOUR help and YOUR backing we can do it. And we promise you the finest, most professional and best value facility for miles and miles around. An architect friend once told us ""It doesn't cost any more to design and build a superb facility than it does an awful one, it's all about the vision you have"". And our vision is the very best, at a price you can afford. We've already surpassed our expectations with the first room. We know we can carry that through to the rest of the facility. But we can do it faster, more effectively, and be open and of service to the local music community much quicker with your help than we can without. </p><p>Thank You</p><p>James</p></div>","Hi there!

We know that when this new studio is completed, we can only go bigger and better, bringing in more of the best music clients and creating what they want to hear, and all whilst keeping the same value for money we offered in our old location.Such a devotion to the music industry is what makes the studio work. All day, every day. Bringing quality to today's music world.Risks & ChallengesOf course there would never be any sort of business that runs without risk. Risk is what keeps us pumping with the adrenaline we need to carry on!But on a serious note, running a business such as ours is never predictable and one day we may have bookings from 7am until midnight, other days we may be completely empty.We can't tell how the future will go, but we know that with the vision we have for the future of our business and with the determination we have, and with our track record, our chances of success are good.There is always the risk of running out of money before you are up and running sufficiently to break even. This is the situation we are in now. Our rent goes out every month, electricity bills, business rates and much more, and our small pool of money is slowly shrinking. This is the reason for creating a crowdfunding campaign, in the hope that you can help us to achieve our goal and that, by return, we can help you to achieve your musical goals. With the £10,000 we need, we will be able to open the studio with enough money to do it properly and on schedule.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't donate to our cause, you can still help! Publicity is key when trying to do something like this, and with the rise of social media, it's now easier than ever.Why don't you share it on Facebook, Tweet it, Instagram, YouTube, you name it! Every time you post something about our cause, such as sharing this crowdfunding campaign online to your friends and family, it helps us to become more known to the community and gives us a better chance at success.There's even built-in share tools on Indiegogo.com so you don't have to waste any time messing around with apps and emails! ConclusionSo if you can help us and you feel like making a difference to two incredibly dedicated, customer focused and music-obsessed business owners, and you feel you can help us turn what was originally a bad situation into an unbeatable facility for anyone and everyone to use and you feel like joining the Cosmic Audio family, please please donate to us and we promise to you that it will be worth your investment. We have kept our business targets realistic, we have affordable premises, and we have that vision and plan. But the rising cost of materials, and the huge and unexpected cost of moving from our old premises has left us only just enough money to complete our first rehearsal room. And income from one room won't enable us to break even - so we need to get the rest of the studio built as quickly as possible in order to survive. With YOUR help and YOUR backing we can do it. And we promise you the finest, most professional and best value facility for miles and miles around. An architect friend once told us ""It doesn't cost any more to design and build a superb facility than it does an awful one, it's all about the vision you have"". And our vision is the very best, at a price you can afford. We've already surpassed our expectations with the first room. We know we can carry that through to the rest of the facility. But we can do it faster, more effectively, and be open and of service to the local music community much quicker with your help than we can without. Thank YouJames",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Three Montreal jazz legends together for a historical recording!</p>
<p>A dream trio for all musicologists worldwide!</p>
<p>Montreal has its own Jazz sound, its own texture, and cultural identity.The East Coast Sound is unique and Montreal musicians of the 50s - 70s and even today, make it a world-renowned city of Jazz .</p>
<p>The greater Montreal area is recognized as the birthplace of many prestigious musicians / artists like Oscar Peterson, Maynard Ferguson, André Gagnon, Simple Plan and Celine Dion.</p>
<p>Montreal is also synonymous with its International Jazz Festival, the largest in the world. Among the musicians who appeared there throughout the 37 years of its history, these three Montreal musicians took part with panache and constancy. Together they have performed at least 120 times at the Jazz Fest. They also count themselves as recipients of the Oscar Peterson Award.</p>
<p>But who are these legends?</p>
<p>All born in Montreal and friends since childhood, these three jazz giants lived and marked the height of the jazz years 1950-2016.</p>
<p>Today aged 73, 82 and 80 and at the height of their fame, they offer the world a testament that is a historical musical legacy!</p>
<p>Guy Nadon, drummer, composer and arranger. dubbed the “King of the Drum”, started his fabulous career playing in the streets on tin cans.</p>
<p>Michel Donato, bassist, composer and singer. One of the most sought after bassists in the country, he is also a member of the Order of Canada.</p>
<p>Vic Vogel has gone around the world as a pianist, arranger, composer and conductor. Among many other things, he composed and arranged the music for the 1976 Olympic Games and has accompanied many of the greatest names who have performed in Montreal. The list is exhaustive. Since 1968, he still practices with his Le Jazz Big Band.</p>

<p>Listening to the CD Chez Vic, you'll relive the atmosphere of the famous Red Light. And even better, you can see it on DVD / Blu-Ray!</p>

Three Montreal jazz legends together for a historical recording!
A dream trio for all musicologists worldwide!
Montreal has its own Jazz sound, its own texture, and cultural identity.The East Coast Sound is unique and Montreal musicians of the 50s - 70s and even today, make it a world-renowned city of Jazz .
The greater Montreal area is recognized as the birthplace of many prestigious musicians / artists like Oscar Peterson, Maynard Ferguson, André Gagnon, Simple Plan and Celine Dion.
Montreal is also synonymous with its International Jazz Festival, the largest in the world. Among the musicians who appeared there throughout the 37 years of its history, these three Montreal musicians took part with panache and constancy. Together they have performed at least 120 times at the Jazz Fest. They also count themselves as recipients of the Oscar Peterson Award.
But who are these legends?
All born in Montreal and friends since childhood, these three jazz giants lived and marked the height of the jazz years 1950-2016.
Today aged 73, 82 and 80 and at the height of their fame, they offer the world a testament that is a historical musical legacy!
Guy Nadon, drummer, composer and arranger. dubbed the “King of the Drum”, started his fabulous career playing in the streets on tin cans.
Michel Donato, bassist, composer and singer. One of the most sought after bassists in the country, he is also a member of the Order of Canada.
Vic Vogel has gone around the world as a pianist, arranger, composer and conductor. Among many other things, he composed and arranged the music for the 1976 Olympic Games and has accompanied many of the greatest names who have performed in Montreal. The list is exhaustive. Since 1968, he still practices with his Le Jazz Big Band.

Listening to the CD Chez Vic, you'll relive the atmosphere of the famous Red Light. And even better, you can see it on DVD / Blu-Ray!
Recorded at the home of Vic Vogel on December 17th, 2011, the audio recording will be available only in numeric/digital form.
CD sales are anemic, even virtually non-existent, we opted for a new approach for fans only.
We expect to fund the finishing / printing of our project with the sale of CD / DVD / Blu-Ray limited box set. Sold only here during the Indiegogo period and not available in stores.
We currently have audio and video. The audio capture and mastering is by Guy Tourville that as finished mixing and mastering the audio. Michel Lauzon and his team are busy on the video capture. We have done the video sequence, rush / image editing and are currently finishing the video montage of the trio and adding the interview by Winston McQuade.
Subsequently, there will we be the programing of the DVD and Blu-Ray to do. We decided to add a Blu-Ray because everything was shot in HD and we think it is worth it to give you this quality.
We have our Concept and Design, editing and layout, there are some corrections to do and some adding before we can proceed to printing. The box will be a DVD size case with an horizontal booklet with over 34 pages of photos, a poster, texts, etc.We thank you all in advance for your support in our project.

WCOS is here to help lift these amazing singers by getting them the roles, stage experience, and operatic role credits they need to support future international careers. </p> <p>The West Coast Opera Studio is co-producing an evening of opera with Opera Mariposa, a company that ""stands at the forefront of Vancouver's opera scene"" (The Vancouver Project) and which is currently in its fifth critically acclaimed year. Together, they will present two baroque one-act operas from the standard repertoire - Pergolesi's <i>La serva padrona </i>and Purcell's <i>Dido and Aeneas</i> - for two nights only at Vancouver's iconic Metro Theatre. </p>
<p>But the arts in the Lower Mainland are hard to sustain and fund. Theatre, musical direction, insurance and costume costs can become insurmountable financial hurdles without your help. On July 29th and 30th, 2016, we want to celebrate the arts in Vancouver and showcase these amazing voices - but we can't do it without you. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to cover costs for the show, plain and simple. $2500 is at the very low end of what we might need for these operas - $1000 goes to the theatre rental cost alone - and even then the financial burden is high.

</div></div>","West Coast Opera Studio The West Coast Opera Studio is a newly-founded studio opera program in Vancouver, BC aimed at giving performance opportunities to talented opera students and young artists whose financial limitations or personal situations have kept them from the operatic stage. WCOS is here to help lift these amazing singers by getting them the roles, stage experience, and operatic role credits they need to support future international careers.  The West Coast Opera Studio is co-producing an evening of opera with Opera Mariposa, a company that ""stands at the forefront of Vancouver's opera scene"" (The Vancouver Project) and which is currently in its fifth critically acclaimed year. Together, they will present two baroque one-act operas from the standard repertoire - Pergolesi's La serva padrona and Purcell's Dido and Aeneas - for two nights only at Vancouver's iconic Metro Theatre. 
But the arts in the Lower Mainland are hard to sustain and fund. Theatre, musical direction, insurance and costume costs can become insurmountable financial hurdles without your help. On July 29th and 30th, 2016, we want to celebrate the arts in Vancouver and showcase these amazing voices - but we can't do it without you.    What We Need & What You Get We need to cover costs for the show, plain and simple. $2500 is at the very low end of what we might need for these operas - $1000 goes to the theatre rental cost alone - and even then the financial burden is high.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Ok here we go, nobody on no score and bottom of the ninth.... yeah I dunno where I was going with the Meatloaf lyrics either but I am hoping it got a wee smile and hopefully keeps you reading.</p>
<p>So hello and welcome my name is Simon and I am a part time singer and karaoke presenter although mainly the karaoke nowadays.  Been singing as long as I can remember, starting in school choirs and then joining a local male voice choir that my father was in by the time I was 12.</p>
<p>The bug caught fully by adulthood and I became a karaoke fiend who just had to sing which as so often happens led to doing some hosting then a party or two before the big pressure of weddings and even funerals...trust me it is the toughest audience you could ever play too for about the first hour then it it the most glorious celebration and energy that I have ever witnessed in my life and I have done more than a couple of them over the years.</p>
<p>So where is this all going I hear you ask. Well quite simply I would like to finally release an album of some of the songs I have done over the years to finally find out just what I sound like with some proper recording and mainly to simply say ""yeah I did that"".</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Well as you can no doubt imagine starting all this from scratch is not the cheapest idea I have ever had so I am hoping to get a little help from across the country, maybe from some others who have thought ""I wish I had done that have some cash nice person"".</p>
<p>I am aiming to keeps the costs totally open, honest and upfront although I hope you can appreciate that as I have never done any studio work I can't be certain of total time needed for recording.  I will be honest and say that many of the songs I do I have had years of practice at, so am confident of only needing a few takes and hopefully getting as many as 12 songs onto the final album but a minimum of 8 is the goal and will announce the prospective set list within next few weeks.**UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE**</p>
<p>So I will be using a local studio (like literally right next door to where I work which is a bonus) and they have been great with tips and advice as well as a sweet deal.  My estimated cost for the studio time and work is around £400</p>
<p>They are also able to assist with the licencing of the album so all the royalties go to the right people and I get no letters from very rich people with very good lawyers that would just make me cry. The licencing for the initial run of 200 albums is expected to be around the £200-£250 mark depending on final inclusions to the album although depending how well this campaign goes I might even get a few more done which would be lovely.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Ok here we go, nobody on no score and bottom of the ninth.... yeah I dunno where I was going with the Meatloaf lyrics either but I am hoping it got a wee smile and hopefully keeps you reading.
So hello and welcome my name is Simon and I am a part time singer and karaoke presenter although mainly the karaoke nowadays.  Been singing as long as I can remember, starting in school choirs and then joining a local male voice choir that my father was in by the time I was 12.
The bug caught fully by adulthood and I became a karaoke fiend who just had to sing which as so often happens led to doing some hosting then a party or two before the big pressure of weddings and even funerals...trust me it is the toughest audience you could ever play too for about the first hour then it it the most glorious celebration and energy that I have ever witnessed in my life and I have done more than a couple of them over the years.
So where is this all going I hear you ask. Well quite simply I would like to finally release an album of some of the songs I have done over the years to finally find out just what I sound like with some proper recording and mainly to simply say ""yeah I did that"".
   What We Need & What You Get Well as you can no doubt imagine starting all this from scratch is not the cheapest idea I have ever had so I am hoping to get a little help from across the country, maybe from some others who have thought ""I wish I had done that have some cash nice person"".
I am aiming to keeps the costs totally open, honest and upfront although I hope you can appreciate that as I have never done any studio work I can't be certain of total time needed for recording.  I will be honest and say that many of the songs I do I have had years of practice at, so am confident of only needing a few takes and hopefully getting as many as 12 songs onto the final album but a minimum of 8 is the goal and will announce the prospective set list within next few weeks.**UPDATE AT BOTTOM OF PAGE**
So I will be using a local studio (like literally right next door to where I work which is a bonus) and they have been great with tips and advice as well as a sweet deal.  My estimated cost for the studio time and work is around £400
They are also able to assist with the licencing of the album so all the royalties go to the right people and I get no letters from very rich people with very good lawyers that would just make me cry. The licencing for the initial run of 200 albums is expected to be around the £200-£250 mark depending on final inclusions to the album although depending how well this campaign goes I might even get a few more done which would be lovely.
I am even updating my backing track library and have also arranged a good deal on this to get all needed backing tracks for just £50
Reproduction is no cheap thing as I have found out after hours and hours of web surfing, phone calls and emails back and forward.  In the end I have chosen a large, established and reputable as well as ethical company to carry out the work for around about £240 for the run of 200 albums. This incluses full colour printing on the CD as well as full colour card packaging for the album.
Well that pretty much covers the costs although I am happy to point out that saving hard (yeah I work full time too) has got me to the point that I should be able to have the studio booked and paid for and ready to start recording by the end of May 2015.
    The Impact Ok I have no sob story, no lifelong promise to a friend or family member just a burning itch to see if I can take my music to the masses and maybe just maybe prove that there are still some great amateur singers out there that if given the chance can get some of the spotlight. 
Hey I have enough material (ok ok I do covers but it is still material) for another album or two so with a little help from you dear reader we could turn this unknown fat lad with a mic into the next big superstar or at the very least I get my 15 minutes of fame.
    Risks & Challenges I can honestly say other than getting the finances in place I don't really foresee any obstacles or risks.

On Saturday mornings, kids from all backgrounds leave their worries and differences behind to join voices and sing their hearts out - together. A program of the MacPhail Center for Music in Minneapolis, MN, the MacPhail Community Youth Choir (MCYC) welcomes all kids in grades 9-12 from throughout the Twin Cities to learn and gain confidence through music. Inclusion, friendship and hope are the cornerstones of this inspiring group, and are reflected in all the music they perform. Led by Twin Cities’ artist J.D. Steele, of the famous Steele Family, this choir is free and open to students of all skill levels and talents through the programming of the MacPhail Center for Music in Minneapolis. These energetic, young people perform many styles of music including jazz, gospel, pop and East African. 

(Choir performing at MN Governor's inauguration.)Your donation will ensure this choir remains a free program to all its young members and will help expand the membership to more kids who otherwise couldn't participate. You can help ensure that we never have to turn away a child because of financial hardship. Watch the video, listen to the music and invest in these brilliant kids. 


(Choir with Shangalia  - a youth choir from Kenya at the Ordway Theater.)
A thrilling highlight for the choir in 2010 was the opportunity to perform at the Flint Hills International Children’s Festival with Shangilia - a similar youth performance group from Nairobi, Kenya, also under the direction of JD Steele. This exciting international project provided the MCYC youth the opportunity to engage with their peers in Kenya on a cultural and artistic level.
What we need.

Please, give generously and give now.

We urgently need $5,300 to... 
1) Keep the choir FREE for ALL kids who wish to join by continuing to cover critical operating expenses, like rehearsal space. 
2) Help ensure that no child is ever turned away from the choir for financial reasons. 
3) Bring in new choir members through basic marketing. 
4) Fund future experiences and performances for the group, like the concert with the choir from Kenya!


What you get.

You get access to one of a kind music opportunities ONLY available through this campaign. 
How about a recording session on state of the art equipment, produced by JD Steele, for you or your band? 
Or, get a discounted music lesson (in person or online) from a world class instructor at the MacPhail Center for Music.

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My Story</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>A Dramatic Symphony for Stings</b></p>
<p>My name is Anthony Thers-Crow, I am a composer, totally self 
initiated from an early age without any coercion from outside, and for 
the most part I am entirely self taught. The subject of my campaign, ‘Lacrimae Mundi,’ 
is a large scale symphonic piece, for an equally large string orchestra.
 It is a canvas of huge dimensions, a journey in music, touching upon 
lush romantic harmonies moving through expansive deserts of arid 
dissonance, going in one instance from ‘scenes’ of dramatic turbulence, 
to almost serene etherial silences. A tapestry thus, in sound. Its 
overall structure is that of an extensive “Original Theme and 
Variations.”</p>
<p>A theme is very akin to a seed, an apple pip held in
 the palm of the hand. Within  already exits, so miraculously 
concentrated, the future tree with its own character, its root system, 
its branches, leaves, later blossom, then fruit within which again, 
those generative pips. Thus a theme, or musical idea, in possession of 
real essence, contains likewise, entire worlds, of harmonies, rhythms, 
and possible evolutions which need their own unique time to unfold like a
 butterfly from out a chrysalis. A piece of music thus requires its own 
time too, to evolve and fulfill itself, and only thus can the result be 
fully satisfying. Thus space in time is a very mute point.</p>
<p> The
 most wonderful thing a creative artist can be given is this crucial and
 most valuable of all commodities, space in time, to realize his or her 
vision to the full. This is what I have the audacity to encourage you to
 grant me now, so I myself can fully realize my visions and  intentions 
thus hopefully rendering something truly satisfying into the world. This
 extraordinary work is now in the process of composition but still 
requires an enormously quantity of intensely concentrated hard work to 
bring to completion, the most important component being, which is at the
 very heart of the matter, sufficient time within which to do so. I 
reckon, the ‘space in time’ needed would be a further fifteen to 
eighteen months to complete this most joyous task. The object of this 
project thus, is to gather together a sufficiency of funds, to sustain 
me during this period, enabling me to live moderately, in relative peace
 and quiet, without financial worries, so that I can work without 
interruption to realize this vision that is “Lacrimae Mundi.” In a word,
 I am asking for the ultimate true artist’s dream. I thus invite you to 
join me in pursuit of this objective. <br/></p>
<p>Just to give a further 
glimpse, a bit like a preview, as to what you can expect, musically 
speaking, the work sets out in the apparent style of a divertimento in 
‘innocent’  C major, with a theme announced on  unaccompanied violas 
(see video) which could be deemed ‘skittish’, but this illusory, as it 
leads very soon into music of extreme contrasts, turning sudden corners,
 evoking in the listener equally contrasting emotional responses. The 
opening motif returns as a ‘Puck’ like character, definitely 
metamorphosing towards the ‘skittish,’ much like a court jester but in 
musical terms, in various guises, at one point as a jaunty grotesque 
march with the theme coming in, in multiple canon and altered forms, on a
 cluster of solo violins, shrouded in an atmosphere of nightmare, whilst
 at another point, a surreal dance leading into a huge epic collage, and
 finally as a cock-a-snoop mocking figure, emerging from a dark 
landscape of harmonies, as if out of the dust of catastrophe, 
accompanied as it were by a band of crazy minstrels adding their weird 
accompaniments, who dance and cajole, twirl and whirl around, an 
extraordinary phantom ballet evoked by sound, only to fade away into the
 gloom out of which comes a surprise. The piece is in fact a huge 
fantasia held together by thematic cohesiveness, thus therefore, truly 
symphonic. The title though, Lacrimae Mundi, “The tears of the world” is
 not at all illusory. <br/></p>
<p><b>A Biographical Note</b><br/></p>
<h3></h3>I was born on 11th July 1950, (née Anthony John William Crowthers) in Newcastle Upon Tyne, into a very original family, all very musically inclined, who have in their own way contributed considerably in their chosen fields to the world and the greater well being of humanity. I discovered music by ‘accident’ so to speak, at the age of twelve, when I unearthed amongst a heap of very dusty junk in the back of our garage, some old 78’s dating from around 1935, with all the labels illegible, faded by time, apart from the still recognizable, just barely visible image of that immortal icon known throughout the world, of the dog looking down the gramophone horn. Intrigued, I snuk back into the house, and started playing them. As soon as the needle touched bakelite, I was entranced, enraptured, and upon that instant everything changed. My world as it were turning upon a sixpence! This was my first experience of classical music, and for better or for worse, music, not so very slowly, was to become the epicenter of my life.<br/>  <br/><p>The second shock, as if to seal the deal, was administered upon hearing Beethoven for the first time, and thus the ‘die was caste’, and I made at the age of 14 the definite irrevocable decision, never to be revoked, to be a composer. It became my one and all consuming passion. Literally I lived, ate, drank, slept even dreamed music. I spent all my pocket money on buying records and scores, from which I taught myself, amongst other things, the art orchestration. I fell wildly in love with 20th Century classical music, which I investigated with dire alacrity, my first purchased score being Alban Berg’s three Pieces for orchestra, Op.6. Shostakovich, whose music was to me a revelation, became the central musical influence of my life, and is as dear and close to me now, if not more so, than it was then. His music as well as his astonishing personality and shear greatness of soul, profound humanity, and of an extraordinary resilience in the face of terrifying tyranny, has been my great abiding inspiration and he is perhaps above all, the ‘father’ of my musical creativity. To him I owe much. <br/></p>
<p>But, my glee and joy at this totally new orientation of my life was met by very stony faces, not amused you could say, in the least, and there began a ruthless opposition that took on subtle and not so subtle forms and so violent and heavy was the discouragement with which I was dealt, trampling all such aspirations  underfoot over a protracted period of four years, so that by the age of eighteen I was rendered dysfunctional and considerably psychologically disturbed landing me on a psychiatrist’s couch, which was rather ironic, as I was not the one who was insane, but more in an acute state of hyper-distress, a condition directly precipitated by having been forcibly divorced from my life’s true purpose. “Beware of those who seek to destroy the soul,” I got to know a lot about them! But nevertheless this deep love of music never died, slipping as it did deep inside, a cunning exercise perhaps in self preservation, becoming dormant, undergoing a metamorphosis in its inner silence, liken unto mushrooms growing in the dark, only to re-awaken later. I never quite believed the lies and abuse I was subjected to. There is always that deeper self that knows the truth.</p>
<p>In spite of everything though, I did manage in those harrowed schooldays, to compose a piano sonata, the exposition of a very dramatic symphony, a song for tenor voice, clarinet and piano, other songs, and many sketches and fragments for other pieces, and extensive creative plans. I was totally self taught in all these creative endeavors. But alas all had to be abandoned. But nothing though, as I later found out, is ever lost.<br/></p>
<p>So my life took on entirely new contours entering into a series of phases and experiences, passing through as many different professions as I did countries. I ended up as a gourmet chef at a ‘world class’ hotel on the Greek Island Santorini, achieving mention in the press and a certain renown attracting a considerable following. But all the while, whenever spare coins jingled in my pocket, they went to buy a record, a score, music always remaining very close to me. On the 25th February 2009, I took the “Bull by the Horns,” and decided to re-dedicate my life, totally this time, to its true purpose, composition, abandoning everything else. It was ‘now or never’ time. And quite literally everything abandoned me. A reflexive action. Doors slammed shut. Again the forces of opposition and hostility rose up like specters. But this time I ignored them and was perhaps even encouraged, and began working relentlessly hard, from early in the morning late into the night to consolidate my ‘style‘ from which came my first composition in my newly developed idiom, “Requiem for a Friend” for Lyric Soprano and Solo Flute. I laid the foundations for Lacrimae Mundi (see video and story) in the Winter of 2010 in very harsh economic circumstances. But the darkened sky above was not without its stars, two friends sent me a little allowance to sustain me during this period. To them I will be eternally grateful.<br/></p>
<p>But I realized that I had also to find a means to earn enough money to scrape by in such a way that it did not sap my vital energies detracting me as little as possible from my music. Thus, upon an unexpected suggestion of a friend I became a travel guide on Santorini, taking guided tours, up the famous volcano, through the plethora of beautiful villages with which the island is well peppered, visiting some of its extraordinary churches and famous wineries. I was beginning to make a very definite name for myself in this new found ‘career,’ thoroughly enjoying this work, being well and truly in my element, and was set to do very well, when out of the blue, the hand of fate stepped in, in the form of a motorcycle accident, being turned over as I was in the volcanic dust, by my fateful motorbike, ‘Red Cow’, shattering the central bone of my right ankle, the Talus. <br/></p>
<p>All was flung up into the air! Everything was swept away : means of livelihood, lifestyle, practically all my possessions amongst which there was my wonderful library of scores and books accumulated since boyhood, being rendered suddenly homeless, thrown out on my neck by a very ruthless landlord with literally my crutches being thrown after me. Total disaster?..........No! By an extraordinary series of events, guided by that invisible hand which has been protecting me all my life long, I was brought to a small Greek village, Nea Gonia, in North Greece, near to Thessaloniki, where I was taken into the home of angelically kind friends who looked after me while I underwent an extensive series of surgical operations on my feet. They made a very cosy space for me in their home where I was able to set up my music studio. Where in my invalid condition I was yet again able even more so than ever before to focus and concentrate on my music advancing my creativity into new territories, into new heights of expression and exploring new possibilities. So life, after all, had conspired all the while to bring me to this point. This is where you find me now. I am glad to announce that the days of my convalescence are nearing their conclusion and I will able once more to set sail, entering in upon unchartered waters, to continue my musical odyssey. Upon which, the first great gargantuan task will be, the completion of Lacrimae Mundi.</p>
<p><b>The Fund's intended destiny</b></p>
<p>I have estimated that the funds necessary  to enable 'Lacrimae Mundi' to be completed will be $45,000 which requires around eighteen months to finish and have the score ready.</p>
<p>          ""At the still point of the turning world, there the dance begins.""</p>
<p>                                                                                               T.S.Elliot from the Four Quartets <br/></p>
<p>The majority of the money will be used to give me a moderate monthly income to enable me to work in a very much required secluded quiet environment uninterrupted so that I can concentrate without disturbance  to bring this work to complete fruition. I have to add that I am extremely sensitive to sound and thus in this extremely mechanical age with all its alien noises, to find a suitable place to live is an art in itself. But somewhere quiet and a little remote where a bird still sings is not so difficult in the rollings hills of Northern Greece. So there I will endeavor to find that most sought after<br/></p>
<p>                                   'Pool of clear silence, for by it, there the music grows.' <br/>
</p>
<p>The other expenses will be materials and perhaps  some extra musical equipment, a keyboard, notation software, to help the 'work' along. Not to mention oodles of manuscript paper, rubbers and pencil leads!</p>
<p><b>What would happen if...........</b><br/></p>
<p> I do not succeed in achieving my fund goal is that with the monies that I will receive. I will dedicate it to working to complete Lacrimae Mundi, advancing it as far as I can go.<br/></p>

 butterfly from out a chrysalis. A piece of music thus requires its own 
time too, to evolve and fulfill itself, and only thus can the result be 
fully satisfying. Thus space in time is a very mute point.
 The
 most wonderful thing a creative artist can be given is this crucial and
 most valuable of all commodities, space in time, to realize his or her 
vision to the full. This is what I have the audacity to encourage you to
 grant me now, so I myself can fully realize my visions and  intentions 
thus hopefully rendering something truly satisfying into the world. This
 extraordinary work is now in the process of composition but still 
requires an enormously quantity of intensely concentrated hard work to 
bring to completion, the most important component being, which is at the
 very heart of the matter, sufficient time within which to do so. I 
reckon, the ‘space in time’ needed would be a further fifteen to 
eighteen months to complete this most joyous task. The object of this 
project thus, is to gather together a sufficiency of funds, to sustain 
me during this period, enabling me to live moderately, in relative peace
 and quiet, without financial worries, so that I can work without 
interruption to realize this vision that is “Lacrimae Mundi.” In a word,
 I am asking for the ultimate true artist’s dream. I thus invite you to 
join me in pursuit of this objective. 
Just to give a further 
glimpse, a bit like a preview, as to what you can expect, musically 
speaking, the work sets out in the apparent style of a divertimento in 
‘innocent’  C major, with a theme announced on  unaccompanied violas 
(see video) which could be deemed ‘skittish’, but this illusory, as it 
leads very soon into music of extreme contrasts, turning sudden corners,
 evoking in the listener equally contrasting emotional responses. The 
opening motif returns as a ‘Puck’ like character, definitely 
metamorphosing towards the ‘skittish,’ much like a court jester but in 
musical terms, in various guises, at one point as a jaunty grotesque 
march with the theme coming in, in multiple canon and altered forms, on a
 cluster of solo violins, shrouded in an atmosphere of nightmare, whilst
 at another point, a surreal dance leading into a huge epic collage, and
 finally as a cock-a-snoop mocking figure, emerging from a dark 
landscape of harmonies, as if out of the dust of catastrophe, 
accompanied as it were by a band of crazy minstrels adding their weird 
accompaniments, who dance and cajole, twirl and whirl around, an 
extraordinary phantom ballet evoked by sound, only to fade away into the
 gloom out of which comes a surprise. The piece is in fact a huge 
fantasia held together by thematic cohesiveness, thus therefore, truly 
symphonic. The title though, Lacrimae Mundi, “The tears of the world” is
 not at all illusory. 
A Biographical Note
I was born on 11th July 1950, (née Anthony John William Crowthers) in Newcastle Upon Tyne, into a very original family, all very musically inclined, who have in their own way contributed considerably in their chosen fields to the world and the greater well being of humanity. I discovered music by ‘accident’ so to speak, at the age of twelve, when I unearthed amongst a heap of very dusty junk in the back of our garage, some old 78’s dating from around 1935, with all the labels illegible, faded by time, apart from the still recognizable, just barely visible image of that immortal icon known throughout the world, of the dog looking down the gramophone horn. Intrigued, I snuk back into the house, and started playing them. As soon as the needle touched bakelite, I was entranced, enraptured, and upon that instant everything changed. My world as it were turning upon a sixpence! This was my first experience of classical music, and for better or for worse, music, not so very slowly, was to become the epicenter of my life.  The second shock, as if to seal the deal, was administered upon hearing Beethoven for the first time, and thus the ‘die was caste’, and I made at the age of 14 the definite irrevocable decision, never to be revoked, to be a composer. It became my one and all consuming passion. Literally I lived, ate, drank, slept even dreamed music. I spent all my pocket money on buying records and scores, from which I taught myself, amongst other things, the art orchestration. I fell wildly in love with 20th Century classical music, which I investigated with dire alacrity, my first purchased score being Alban Berg’s three Pieces for orchestra, Op.6. Shostakovich, whose music was to me a revelation, became the central musical influence of my life, and is as dear and close to me now, if not more so, than it was then. His music as well as his astonishing personality and shear greatness of soul, profound humanity, and of an extraordinary resilience in the face of terrifying tyranny, has been my great abiding inspiration and he is perhaps above all, the ‘father’ of my musical creativity. To him I owe much. 
But, my glee and joy at this totally new orientation of my life was met by very stony faces, not amused you could say, in the least, and there began a ruthless opposition that took on subtle and not so subtle forms and so violent and heavy was the discouragement with which I was dealt, trampling all such aspirations  underfoot over a protracted period of four years, so that by the age of eighteen I was rendered dysfunctional and considerably psychologically disturbed landing me on a psychiatrist’s couch, which was rather ironic, as I was not the one who was insane, but more in an acute state of hyper-distress, a condition directly precipitated by having been forcibly divorced from my life’s true purpose. “Beware of those who seek to destroy the soul,” I got to know a lot about them! But nevertheless this deep love of music never died, slipping as it did deep inside, a cunning exercise perhaps in self preservation, becoming dormant, undergoing a metamorphosis in its inner silence, liken unto mushrooms growing in the dark, only to re-awaken later. I never quite believed the lies and abuse I was subjected to. There is always that deeper self that knows the truth.
In spite of everything though, I did manage in those harrowed schooldays, to compose a piano sonata, the exposition of a very dramatic symphony, a song for tenor voice, clarinet and piano, other songs, and many sketches and fragments for other pieces, and extensive creative plans. I was totally self taught in all these creative endeavors. But alas all had to be abandoned. But nothing though, as I later found out, is ever lost.
So my life took on entirely new contours entering into a series of phases and experiences, passing through as many different professions as I did countries. I ended up as a gourmet chef at a ‘world class’ hotel on the Greek Island Santorini, achieving mention in the press and a certain renown attracting a considerable following. But all the while, whenever spare coins jingled in my pocket, they went to buy a record, a score, music always remaining very close to me. On the 25th February 2009, I took the “Bull by the Horns,” and decided to re-dedicate my life, totally this time, to its true purpose, composition, abandoning everything else. It was ‘now or never’ time. And quite literally everything abandoned me. A reflexive action. Doors slammed shut. Again the forces of opposition and hostility rose up like specters. But this time I ignored them and was perhaps even encouraged, and began working relentlessly hard, from early in the morning late into the night to consolidate my ‘style‘ from which came my first composition in my newly developed idiom, “Requiem for a Friend” for Lyric Soprano and Solo Flute. I laid the foundations for Lacrimae Mundi (see video and story) in the Winter of 2010 in very harsh economic circumstances. But the darkened sky above was not without its stars, two friends sent me a little allowance to sustain me during this period. To them I will be eternally grateful.
But I realized that I had also to find a means to earn enough money to scrape by in such a way that it did not sap my vital energies detracting me as little as possible from my music. Thus, upon an unexpected suggestion of a friend I became a travel guide on Santorini, taking guided tours, up the famous volcano, through the plethora of beautiful villages with which the island is well peppered, visiting some of its extraordinary churches and famous wineries. I was beginning to make a very definite name for myself in this new found ‘career,’ thoroughly enjoying this work, being well and truly in my element, and was set to do very well, when out of the blue, the hand of fate stepped in, in the form of a motorcycle accident, being turned over as I was in the volcanic dust, by my fateful motorbike, ‘Red Cow’, shattering the central bone of my right ankle, the Talus. 
All was flung up into the air! Everything was swept away : means of livelihood, lifestyle, practically all my possessions amongst which there was my wonderful library of scores and books accumulated since boyhood, being rendered suddenly homeless, thrown out on my neck by a very ruthless landlord with literally my crutches being thrown after me. Total disaster?..........No! By an extraordinary series of events, guided by that invisible hand which has been protecting me all my life long, I was brought to a small Greek village, Nea Gonia, in North Greece, near to Thessaloniki, where I was taken into the home of angelically kind friends who looked after me while I underwent an extensive series of surgical operations on my feet. They made a very cosy space for me in their home where I was able to set up my music studio. Where in my invalid condition I was yet again able even more so than ever before to focus and concentrate on my music advancing my creativity into new territories, into new heights of expression and exploring new possibilities. So life, after all, had conspired all the while to bring me to this point. This is where you find me now. I am glad to announce that the days of my convalescence are nearing their conclusion and I will able once more to set sail, entering in upon unchartered waters, to continue my musical odyssey. Upon which, the first great gargantuan task will be, the completion of Lacrimae Mundi.
The Fund's intended destiny
I have estimated that the funds necessary  to enable 'Lacrimae Mundi' to be completed will be $45,000 which requires around eighteen months to finish and have the score ready.
          ""At the still point of the turning world, there the dance begins.""
                                                                                               T.S.Elliot from the Four Quartets 
The majority of the money will be used to give me a moderate monthly income to enable me to work in a very much required secluded quiet environment uninterrupted so that I can concentrate without disturbance  to bring this work to complete fruition. I have to add that I am extremely sensitive to sound and thus in this extremely mechanical age with all its alien noises, to find a suitable place to live is an art in itself. But somewhere quiet and a little remote where a bird still sings is not so difficult in the rollings hills of Northern Greece. So there I will endeavor to find that most sought after
                                   'Pool of clear silence, for by it, there the music grows.' 

The other expenses will be materials and perhaps  some extra musical equipment, a keyboard, notation software, to help the 'work' along. Not to mention oodles of manuscript paper, rubbers and pencil leads!
What would happen if...........
 I do not succeed in achieving my fund goal is that with the monies that I will receive. I will dedicate it to working to complete Lacrimae Mundi, advancing it as far as I can go.

<b>Introduction // Background:</b> I grew up with the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. As a 1st grader, all I wanted to be was that green ranger guy, Tommy Oliver, I watched on TV everyday at 5 o'clock. In October 2001 I got a keyboard for my birthday, started playing in a few bands and began composing my own music. In late 2006 I self-produced my first full-length album, A Break Through. In 2009 I formed my own indie music label, Meda Yin Music, to serve as an umbrella for releasing all my musical projects. To date I have self-produced 8 albums, which will make Destiny &amp; DragonZords my 9th and 10th. In 2012 I added bass guitar to my repertoire. In 2013 I worked at a wellness center and created martial art based work-outs set to Ron Wasserman's Power Rangers Redux soundtrack. I lost 25 pounds that way, regained a slim physique and taught Power Rangers inspired fitness classes, to both children and adults, in a green MMPR shirt, taking on that persona. I dressed up as a white ninjetti ranger at Anime Boston in 2013 and several people told me I looked a little like Jason David Frank (green and white mighty morphin power ranger) and thus Green Ranger Jr was born. Playing along with this look-a-like comparison, I grew out my hair, started slicking it back Tommy Oliver / Green With Evil style and fully satisfied my 7 year old self to be that Green Ranger.  I began hitting my music studio hard in hopes of crafting a new sound, aiming for a style of largely keyboard/synth based rock/pop sound with bass guitar and Power Ranger-themed lyrics. Here I am now, two years later, ready to release a double-disc album two years in the making. <b>Destiny &amp; DragonZords</b> may be my biggest musical accomplishment yet.</li> <li>
<b>Campaign description and why it's important to me:</b> As I've said in the end of my Like A Smoke Stack music video, off the DragonZords album which is now on YouTube, one of my greatest dreams and visions for this double-disc project is to see it materialized and mass-produced in physical form; something I can hold in my hands, listen to in my car, give out to friends and family, sell at concerts, and think... ""this was my dream. I made it real.""</li>
<li>
<b>Production and logistics:</b> The production of CDs with silver undersides is called ""CD replication."" I have done some research and made a few phone calls. To create a double-disc jewel cased album with a swing tray (2 CDs inside one jewel case), the minimum one must order is 300 units. With a single sheet insert instead of a CD book (cheapest option) I can order 300 copies for $1,190. I work a day job just like everyone else, paying my own rent, bills, student loans, car payments, car insurance, martial arts tuitions... and unfortunately $1,190 is more than I can afford to pay out of my own pocket to make my vision a reality, as much as I would do it in a heartbeat had I the cash. Hence this crowd-funding campaign. </li>
<li>
<b>Magnitude of what you can help me achieve:</b> But maybe this is happening for a reason. Maybe there are people out there who might share in the excitement of the Green Ranger Jr musical experience, and would like to be a part of bringing this idea to life, so that if ever a monster were to attack, Green Ranger Jr will be on-call ready to summon that DragonZord, save Angel Grove, and fulfill his Destiny. Oh wait, I'm Green With Evil. So if you <i>don't</i> fund this project, I kid you <b>not</b> I will summon my DragonZord, <b>find</b> your city and lay it to <b>waste!</b> And there won't be any Power Rangers to help you *evil green ranger laugh* Hmhmhmahahaha.

The first campaign will be for 50 days and carry us to about July 4th. Then the second campaign will be for another $600 and last until the album drop date of August 7th 2015. I wish I could do it all in one campaign, but I'm working with length limits imposed by indiegogo. Also, I'm a big believer in setting small, incremental goals to reach something great, so I don't mind breaking things down into 2 smaller goals if both successful will fund the project.</li> <li>The biggest perk will be an autographed copy of <b>Destiny &amp; DragonZords</b> shipped out to you.

<h1><span>Who is Yuri Liberzon?</span></h1>
<p><b>He started pursuing his passion for guitar at the age of 6, and followed his dreams after high school to live and study in a completely different country</b> at Johns Hopkins with <a href=""http://www.barrueco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Manuel Barrueco</a> and finally Yale for his master’s degree in music with <a href=""http://www.benjaminverdery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Verdery</a>. He currently has a busy private studio where he teaches students both young and old about the technical and musical aspects of playing classical guitar.</p>
<p>Now, Yuri is confident that his music and passion for guitar can reach beyond the San Francisco Bay Area with the launch of a successful album.

What is this campaign about?

Twenty six years; most people are thankful to have full brain development for decision-making skills by this time (well, that’s age 25 but who’s checking?). Fewer can say that they’re looking to cross the musical bridge that a 26-year-long path has led them to. That is exactly what we’re setting out to do in this campaign.
And no, this doesn’t mean we’re asking you to help raise money to build a bridge that plays music. Or to pave a path that will take 26 years to complete.

</h3> <p>Hi, My names Melisa Kelly, I'm a singer/songwriter based in Glasgow. I've always loved singing and creating music, and for the past five years I have been gigging and writing all around Scotland. I've released an EP and two albums, all with the help of my wonderful music family, with next to no budget and IT'S BEEN A BLAST! This summer having completed my HND at the Academy of Music and Sound, I want to create a new, professional EP of blues music and you can help. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have written the four track blues EP and through Indiegogo we can make it happen. Musicians don't make much, especially original ones but sites like Indiegogo are starting to turn the tides. Taking the power out of the hands of faceless labels and management and putting it back in the hands of musicians.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need!<br/>
</h3> <p>I am looking to raise £4000 for this project, it's a big mountain to climb but many hands make light work. So, what is it that this money is for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Costs - £700, we use a fantastic independent studio, ran by a full time sound engineer and musician.<br/>
</li>
<li>Production of CD - £300, from an environmentally conscience company in Ireland who use recycled materials.<br/>
</li>
<li>Session Musicians - £1000, those sexy folks and their talent, we must pay them for their time in the studio. It is a drop in the ocean when you consider the years of practicing with bloodied fingers to be what they are...EPIC!<br/>
</li>
<li>Music Video - £500 venue, extras, costumes, filming and production.</li>
<li>Launch Party - £500 venue, staff, food, drink, and sound engineer. We have a super cool Glasgow venue that are only charging for the bare essentials!<br/>
</li>
<li>Launch Night Support - £400, more sexy musicians!<br/>
</li>
<li>Merchandise - £400 t-Shirts, badges, plectrums, posters! <br/>
</li>
<li>PR, Advertising - £200, tickets, posters, promotion!</li>
</ul>
<p>PHEW!!!!!<br/></p>Obviously these amounts are rough amounts as there are some £2.16 amounts in there a plenty. Also Indiegogo take 5% of our target amount for the fabulous hosting but also to keep their website going and helping all kinds of great projects.<br/><br/>Anyone who wishes to see an itemized list of expenditure can have it emailed to them directly with all the pennies accounted for :)<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What You Get!<br/>
</h3> <p>Everyone and I mean EVERYONE! that supports the project gets something awesome in return. As you are helping me create my first really professional EP you first have my thanks, and the thanks of those who will be employed to do their creative jobs throughout the process, and paid well for it. Up for grabs!<br/></p> <ul> <li>A copy of the new EP! (of course)</li>
<li>Framed lyrics of your favorite song and CD's of unheard previous music.</li>
<li>A gig in your house! A personalized song about you uploaded to YouTube!<br/>
</li>
<li>An appearance in the music video or an EP song dedicated to you!</li>
<li>A VIP booth for you and friends at the Launch.</li>
</ul>
<p>AND TONS MORE!!!!<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Not everything is so easy, it's a lot of money and nobodies a millionaire. But lots of people aiming for one thing can move mountains and that's why crowdfunding works. So what if we don't reach target? Well, Indiegogo promise that even if we don't reach target, we still get the money we raised to do our project on a smaller scale, most crowdfunding websites don't do that! <br/><br/>Also there is a lot of hard work to be done. If we reach target we must fulfill every promise to our backers and then we must make sure to create a truly kick-ass EP and music video to make you all really proud to be part of it. We are answerable to both you and Indiegogo, we certainly don't get off likely!<br/><br/>Being a musician can be frustrating at times because of finance, but we do it because we love it! Using Indiegogo to fund the project means that we can achieve a far higher quality output and still keep hold of creative control.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>SO, you're looking and thinking 'Hell yeah! I'll fund ya!', thanks bud!<br/><br/>SO, you're looking and thinking 'I don't really have it, but I know some folks who might'.

</div></div>","About Me and the Campaign!
 Hi, My names Melisa Kelly, I'm a singer/songwriter based in Glasgow. I've always loved singing and creating music, and for the past five years I have been gigging and writing all around Scotland. I've released an EP and two albums, all with the help of my wonderful music family, with next to no budget and IT'S BEEN A BLAST! This summer having completed my HND at the Academy of Music and Sound, I want to create a new, professional EP of blues music and you can help. 

I have written the four track blues EP and through Indiegogo we can make it happen. Musicians don't make much, especially original ones but sites like Indiegogo are starting to turn the tides. Taking the power out of the hands of faceless labels and management and putting it back in the hands of musicians.
  What We Need!
 I am looking to raise £4000 for this project, it's a big mountain to climb but many hands make light work. So, what is it that this money is for:

Recording Costs - £700, we use a fantastic independent studio, ran by a full time sound engineer and musician.

Production of CD - £300, from an environmentally conscience company in Ireland who use recycled materials.

Session Musicians - £1000, those sexy folks and their talent, we must pay them for their time in the studio. It is a drop in the ocean when you consider the years of practicing with bloodied fingers to be what they are...EPIC!

Music Video - £500 venue, extras, costumes, filming and production.
Launch Party - £500 venue, staff, food, drink, and sound engineer. We have a super cool Glasgow venue that are only charging for the bare essentials!

Launch Night Support - £400, more sexy musicians!

Merchandise - £400 t-Shirts, badges, plectrums, posters! 

PR, Advertising - £200, tickets, posters, promotion!

PHEW!!!!!Obviously these amounts are rough amounts as there are some £2.16 amounts in there a plenty. Also Indiegogo take 5% of our target amount for the fabulous hosting but also to keep their website going and helping all kinds of great projects.Anyone who wishes to see an itemized list of expenditure can have it emailed to them directly with all the pennies accounted for :)   What You Get!
 Everyone and I mean EVERYONE! that supports the project gets something awesome in return. As you are helping me create my first really professional EP you first have my thanks, and the thanks of those who will be employed to do their creative jobs throughout the process, and paid well for it. Up for grabs!  A copy of the new EP! (of course)
Framed lyrics of your favorite song and CD's of unheard previous music.
A gig in your house! A personalized song about you uploaded to YouTube!

An appearance in the music video or an EP song dedicated to you!
A VIP booth for you and friends at the Launch.

AND TONS MORE!!!!
    Risks & ChallengesNot everything is so easy, it's a lot of money and nobodies a millionaire. But lots of people aiming for one thing can move mountains and that's why crowdfunding works. So what if we don't reach target? Well, Indiegogo promise that even if we don't reach target, we still get the money we raised to do our project on a smaller scale, most crowdfunding websites don't do that! Also there is a lot of hard work to be done.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Welcome to my Indiegogo for launching Carousel, an online and physical record store here in Berlin, Germany. I'm hoping to extend the existing Carousel business <i>(more about that later)</i> into a record store with a little help from you! You might be wondering, why?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Personally, I want to preserve the physical, tangible side of music. The sort of music that gathers dust, the sort of music friendships in record stores are formed over. These physical moments and places are assets to the music and wider communities. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Despite cherishing these physical forms and moments, I would also like to embrace technology in the store, finding that fine balance between moving forward and looking back. We will play host to EP and album launches, and conduct weekly streams online, connecting music aficionados on a global and local community level.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span></p>

Whether you're a supporter of independent music, a record collector, music lover or just like getting behind small business, please take 5 minutes to check out the campaign I've put together. Inside you'll see people who have already supported the project such as the Independent newspaper , Fabric London, Inverted Audio and many more. You'll also see the wide range of pledges and rewards for getting behind the campaign.

""It’s not just a shop, there’s something else going on, it’s like a resource for people, a library for your ears and your mind."" Johnny Marr, 2012, Last Shop Standing

Introduction:
Welcome to my Indiegogo for launching Carousel, an online and physical record store here in Berlin, Germany. I'm hoping to extend the existing Carousel business (more about that later) into a record store with a little help from you! You might be wondering, why?

Personally, I want to preserve the physical, tangible side of music. The sort of music that gathers dust, the sort of music friendships in record stores are formed over. These physical moments and places are assets to the music and wider communities. 

Despite cherishing these physical forms and moments, I would also like to embrace technology in the store, finding that fine balance between moving forward and looking back. We will play host to EP and album launches, and conduct weekly streams online, connecting music aficionados on a global and local community level.

Although music is clearly my passion, I am approaching this with a rational, well planned business mind. With vinyl sales at record highs in 2014, my years working in various tiers of the music industry and running 2 independent (vinyl releasing) labels, this is the next stage for both Carousel and myself as a young, passionate cultural entrepreneur hoping to add a great new asset to Berlin's rich musical and cultural landscape.

Who’s behind it?

I’m a 28 year old musician, DJ and record collector from the UK living in Berlin, Germany. I first announced the project in one of the UK’s leading newspapers The Independent.

I studied Music Production & Culture at university and transferred into a Bachelor of Science with honours in Music Technology.  My final dissertation and year of study focused on music markets, the re-emergence of vinyl as a music medium and the business development and planning for Carousel. The head of department whilst taking my studies left me this reference regarding my plans for the store.

Throughout the last decade I’ve worked across various tiers of the music and entertainment industry including digital music services and record stores. I also co - run 2 independant vinyl releasing labels, Carousel (obviously) and the UK-leaning Shades, now up to its 15th record.



DE:

Wer steckt dahinter?

Ich bin ein 28-jähriger Musiker, DJ und Plattensammler aus Großbritannien, der jetzt in Berlin lebt. Das Projekt habe ich zuerst in einer der führenden Zeitungen Großbritanniens, The Independent, angekündigt.

Ich habe Musikproduktion und -kultur an der Universität studiert, bevor ich zu einem Bachelor of Science in Musiktechnologie wechselte, den ich mit Auszeichnung absolviert habe. In meiner Bachelorarbeit und meinem letzten Jahr an der Uni habe ich mich mit den Musikmärkten, dem Wiederauftreten des Vinyls als Medium und den geschäftlichen Entwicklungen von Carousel auseinandergesetzt. Der Fachleiter hat mir dieses Zeugnis hinsichtlich meiner Pläne für einen Plattenladen während des Studiums gegeben.

Im vergangenen Jahrzehnt habe ich auf verschiedenen Ebenen der Musik- und Entertainmentindustrie gearbeitet, darunter digitale Musikdienste und Plattenläden. Ich bin auch Mitbetreiber zweier Independent-Labels, die Vinyl veröffentlichen: Carousel (versteht sich!) und des UK-orientierten Shades (jetzt bei seiner 15. Platte).

</h3> <p>Hey everybody! <br/>We are <b>be the moon</b>! Some of you know us and some of you are new to our music! In either case, WELCOME! We are an Americana/Indie-Rock band from Mebane, North Carolina. We are raising funds to release our second recording project titled <i>Golden Age</i>. This album is the follow-up to our 2011 EP <i>Streetlight Views</i>. <i>Golden Age</i> is also our first ""full-length"" recording project. These songs represent 18 months of tireless work from ourselves and a dedicated team of recording staff. Your contribution will help us get the culmination of this work out to our fans here and abroad! <br/></p>
<p>Golden Age track sneak peek!!!  <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/be-the-moon/golden-age-preview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/be-the-moon/golden-age-p...</a><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>OK! So here's what we are asking for...we need $2,500.00 to finish up this project. We have work diligently to keep our costs down in order to make this record. This has included have <i>TWO </i>separate studios donate their time and expertise to help us record an mix <i>Golden Age</i>. This $2,500.00 will go towards a few things:</p>
<p>1. Covering the cost to ""master"" of the album (which is, essentially, the ""gloss coat"" to make the music shine). This process helps make the album ready for radio airplay and general release by enhancing the audio quality of the overall recording. <br/></p>
<p>2. The manufacture and shipping of the physical discs. This means CD's...for the last 4 years we have been relying completely on digital copies of our music being passed around by fans. However, we have had a large number of fans request physical copies of our music. In response to this, we are going to do an initial run of 300 discs for for <i>Golden Age</i>!<i> </i>This will account for $600.00 of the budget.</p>
<p>3. Merchandise! Folks...we need some shirts, bumper stickers, hats, and whatnot! Why? Well, we're glad you asked! Believe it or not this is one of the best ways that we can keep ourselves on the road. To those of you who have never played music for a living...it does NOT always pay the best! Now this is due to a variety of factors. However, having merchandise that we can sell at shows allows us to have a separate revenue stream that will cushion us on those ""lean"" paying shows. Plus, it helps us leave our band name in new markets which, in turn, can help us grow a larger fan base. In other words, it helps a LOT! This will account for, roughly, $600.00 of our budget</p>
<p>4. Publishing. Now this is where the <i>music business </i>side comes in. Publishing helps to ensure that everybody is protected from possible illegal use of our music. In other words, it protects us from someone (or a group of someones) taking our songs and claiming them as their own. That happens more than you think. We will be contracting with ASCAP which is an industry leader in protecting guys like us. This will cost $50.00</p>
<p>5. Release promotion. On top of getting the album finish from a production and physical standpoint we also need to TELL folks that we have a new album out. This also costs some money. We will be engaging in a focused media campaign to let people know about us and <i>Golden Age</i>. We will be employing advertising via Facebook and in the community. This will take about $500.00</p>
<p>Now, what happens if we don't make it? Well, in that case we'll have to evaluate what we can trim from the list and still get the record out...but that's NOT going to happen! Why? Because we have the best, most supportive fans in the world and you kind people will come through! <br/></p>
<p> But wait...there's more! We've got a LONG list of awesome and amazing perks that you will receive for helping us fund this project! We'll have autographed CD's, lyric sheets, guitar strings from actual shows, and all manner of other wonderful things! <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>What <i>Golden Age</i> Means For You &amp; Us<br/>
</h3>By contributing you are enabling us to take the next step in our musical journey. We have poured our hearts into the making of this record and we want the world to hear it! Your contribution helps to make that goal possible!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3>For those of you that follow us, you KNOW that this album has been a LONG time in the making! For those of you that are new to be the moon...let us enlighten you! We started making this album in November of 2013...yeah, 2013. At that time we thought that we could record AND release it in six months...that turned out to be wrong. In the middle or recording we had a lineup change in the band and that triggered a rethinking of the entire record. We decided that the material we were working on at the time could be better...no, it <i>NEEDED</i> to be better. So we started from scratch and made the entire album over again! 18 months later...here we are. It has been difficult and tedious at times. However, we feel that we have made the best album that we possibly can at this point in our career. Did we feel like giving up along the way? Sure...but we didn't...and we're not now. Help us overcome the last hurdle to releasing the album by contributing. Every little bit helps...and THANK YOU!!!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't contribute...we understand! Would you mind sharing out our Indiegogo campaign and helping us spread the word? It doesn't cost a dime and we'll be eternally grateful!<br/>

After a sold out show at the Duplex, hit performances in Feinstein’s/54 Below’s inaugural Concert Lab, a few unceremonious breakups, and a lot of bad Coffee Meets Bagel dates, the girls have some plans to bring their show to a computer screen, tv and stage near you.Who We Are: Tessa Slovis and Hannah Kloepfer met as freshman at Barnard College and Columbia University. After graduating they joined forces to begin writing their own cabaret series about their lives as young women in New York City. What has developed is a highly theatrical, heart-on-its-sleeve theater experience, featuring powerhouse arrangements of pop favorites, Golden Age Broadway tunes updated for 2016, and brand-new songs by female songwriters.What’s up with us Now:  We are headed to 54 Below on April 6th at 9:30pm, But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to keep our show running!Where Your Money Goes:

Supporting our team: That includes allowing us to pay our director, musicians, production team, tech staff and guest artists. We make art because we love it and we want to be able to support our fellow artists as much as we can!


MultiMedia: Your donations help us to  keep our website up, and will help us launch our webseries and other multi media projects that we’ve been brainstorming over the past year!

<h3>Who Is Reid the Martian?<br/>
</h3>Reid the Martian, aka Reid Smith, is a hip hop (and then some) artist from Lawrence, KS who’s like no one you’ve ever heard. He raps. He sings. He plays the drums, guitar, and keyboards. He produces unique beats that reflect his love of old-school hip hop, 60s and 70s rock, Broadway tunes, and drumline.</span>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">He’s been described by industry pros as a cross between Justin Timberlake and Eminem, and a “hip-hop novelist” by producer DJ Toomp. His authentic and intricate lyrics, combined with his awesomely singable and memorable hooks, have won him fans from ages 8 to 80. (Not an exaggeration.)</span></p>
<p>Reid’s first EP, <i>Hardball</i>, was released in 2015. We could tell you how awesome it is, but instead of taking it from us, take it from some critics:</p>

<h3>Who's Raising the $?</h3>Smith Bender/Scott Free is a small, but full-of-heart music production company <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">working exclusively with Reid the Martian. Over the past four years, we’ve watched him develop as a songwriter and producer. In 2014 we spent several weeks with Reid in Los Angeles and Atlanta working with some of the biggest names in hip-hop today. Seeing him excel in that environment was what made us realize he's the real deal.</span>
<p><span><br/></span>In that same time period, we also realized that the big labels aren’t interested in working with an artist who hasn’t already “made it.” Basically, as many of you know, an artist has to do all the work the labels used to do, just to get them to give you a look. Given that experience, we decided to take a page out of Macklemore’s and Kansas City’s own Tech N9ne’s books and go the independent route. <span></span>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>THE PROJECT:</i></b></p>
<p>Although we have recorded 4 studio albums, our passion is playing
live.  And to that end, our fans have been
asking for a live album for quite a while. 
So last year we booked a drive-in movie theater as the venue for our
live album.  We played for hours as the
California sun was setting and cars kept streaming into the parking lot.  As soon as the show ended and it was dark
everyone ran back to their cars to watch the movie.  It was a great night and we
got some great recordings!  We selected
12 songs that recreate the feeling and flow of the night.  These particular songs mean a great
deal to us - they come from our life experiences and from the heart. They speak
to the nature of the human experience and the joys and challenges that come
with taking life's journey.  The music
and lyrics can be humorous or reflective, the songs can be folk-based, up-and-funky,
or even  electronic sounding.  “I can’t believe there are just 3 of you, your sound is so big and full!”  - anonymous fan. </p>
<p><b><u>THE EXPENSES:</u></b></p>
<p>-First
we need to pay the recording engineer for capturing the sound at the live show.   $425</p>
<p>-Next
we need to recoup some equipment loses.  Jhon,
the bass and banjo player also does the mixing, editing, and producing for the
band, which saves a <i><u>ton </u></i>of
money in studio costs.  He created most of
the “It Is” album and the entire “Acoustic” album from his home studio.  While he was working on the Live @ the
Drive-In album his computer crashed and could not be fixed.  Therefore a new computer and software are needed to finish this project and create future recordings.  = $3,700</p>
<p> -Then comes the mastering.  This is the process that utilizes <i><u>super</u></i> expensive equipment and a
very fine tuned ear to add the sparkle and depth to the recording.  It makes the recording sound as good as other
professional/radio worthy music, and is required by iTunes and other digital media outlets.  $700</p>
<p>-The final step in the musical process is duplication. 
This is the process of professionally creating the cd’s and the cases
with our art work, and packaging it all up.

<p>Mitt namn är Filip Winther och jag håller precis på att bli klar med mitt första ""riktiga"" musikalbum, vilket jag planerar att släppa om någon månad.<br/>Tanken är att inte endast släppa albumet digitalt, utan även i fysisk form (tillsammans med samlingsalbumet Skåpmat, som släpptes digitalt förra året) och eftersom att detta är rätt dyrt för mig som privatperson vänder jag mig till er! Jag behöver all hjälp jag kan få från er med att nå detta mål! Genom att bidra kommer ni att vara en väldigt stor pusselbit i att göra detta möjligt!<br/><br/>Albumet kommer att bestå av 15 spår. 10 av dessa är aldrig någonsin släppta tidigare och 1 är en remix av en gammal låt!<br/><br/>Alla bidrag spelar roll och alla vänliga själar som går in med minst $1 (ca 8-10 kronor) kommer att få sitt namn skrivet i häftet som finns i CD-fodralet! (Om man inte vill ha med sitt namn men vill bidra ändå är det bara att skicka ett mail till info@filipwinther.com så löser jag det!)<br/>Bidrar man istället med $10 (plus $3 i frakt) kommer man även få en fysisk skiva hemskickad till sig när den är färdig, hur coolt är inte det?!<br/><br/>Jag hoppas att ni vill hjälpa mig med att nå mitt mål. Att ha släppt en fysisk skiva var bara något jag kunde drömma om när jag var mindre. Det här är så häftigt att  jag nästan sprängs!<br/><br/>Om mitt mål dock inte skulle nås kommer det inte vara någon fara för er! Jag kommer fortsätta att spara pengar så att detta kan bli möjligt. Ni som har bidragit kommer fortfarande att få den perk:en som ni ""betalat"" för! Det kommer bara att ta längre tid på grund av min ekonomi!<br/><br/>Detta är en möjlighet för er att hjälpa mig på traven, få era namn skrivna i mitt första fysiska album någonsin samt en chans att förbeställa albumet ($10 eller mer)!<br/><br/>Om du har läst ända hit är du bäst! Nu hoppas jag att du väljer att hjälpa mig med ett par kronor! Ditt bidrag spelar verkligen roll! TACK!</p>

Mitt namn är Filip Winther och jag håller precis på att bli klar med mitt första ""riktiga"" musikalbum, vilket jag planerar att släppa om någon månad.Tanken är att inte endast släppa albumet digitalt, utan även i fysisk form (tillsammans med samlingsalbumet Skåpmat, som släpptes digitalt förra året) och eftersom att detta är rätt dyrt för mig som privatperson vänder jag mig till er! Jag behöver all hjälp jag kan få från er med att nå detta mål! Genom att bidra kommer ni att vara en väldigt stor pusselbit i att göra detta möjligt!Albumet kommer att bestå av 15 spår. 10 av dessa är aldrig någonsin släppta tidigare och 1 är en remix av en gammal låt!Alla bidrag spelar roll och alla vänliga själar som går in med minst $1 (ca 8-10 kronor) kommer att få sitt namn skrivet i häftet som finns i CD-fodralet! (Om man inte vill ha med sitt namn men vill bidra ändå är det bara att skicka ett mail till info@filipwinther.com så löser jag det!)Bidrar man istället med $10 (plus $3 i frakt) kommer man även få en fysisk skiva hemskickad till sig när den är färdig, hur coolt är inte det?!Jag hoppas att ni vill hjälpa mig med att nå mitt mål. Att ha släppt en fysisk skiva var bara något jag kunde drömma om när jag var mindre. Det här är så häftigt att  jag nästan sprängs!Om mitt mål dock inte skulle nås kommer det inte vara någon fara för er! Jag kommer fortsätta att spara pengar så att detta kan bli möjligt. Ni som har bidragit kommer fortfarande att få den perk:en som ni ""betalat"" för! Det kommer bara att ta längre tid på grund av min ekonomi!Detta är en möjlighet för er att hjälpa mig på traven, få era namn skrivna i mitt första fysiska album någonsin samt en chans att förbeställa albumet ($10 eller mer)!Om du har läst ända hit är du bäst! Nu hoppas jag att du väljer att hjälpa mig med ett par kronor! Ditt bidrag spelar verkligen roll! TACK!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
