<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We both
have expertise in natural and social science research and in policy and
practice, especially with regard to conflicting issues and traditional

<p style=""text-align: justify;""> In a recent <a href=""http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/07/songbird-migration/franzen-text"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Geographic article</a>, award winning author Jonathan Franzen calls for renewed action to tackle the issue of migratory bird hunting (MBH) in the Mediterranean. This is because, nearly 35 years after the EU Birds Directive, MBH is still widespread and its impact appears to be increasing as populations of European birds decline. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The practice of MBH is deeply embedded in Italian culture and society, and is governed at the regional or local level. However, knowledge on actions and trends in hunting, as well as the politics surrounding the issue is fragmented. We want to try and change this. By touring hunting areas, we will compile and generate up- to- date information that will both raise its policy and public profile internationally and provide a resource for new thinking on solutions.</p>

1970s MBH was a key issue that generated popular support for bird conservation
and the creation of European conservation frameworks, notably the 1979 Birds
Directive. Today, there is growing awareness among conservation groups that the
issue needs to be revisited as MBH seems to be on the rise again. This seems to
be due to a combination of increasing <b>ease
of accessibility</b> (e.g. hunting tourism), <b>new technologies</b> (particularly song play-back), the <b>Euro-zone crisis</b> (economic hardship
leading to trapping and selling birds) and<b>
political instability</b>. Furthermore, there is a growing talk of deep
antagonism between hunters and bird-protectionists in parts of Europe and that
hunter perspectives are attracting populist political support locally.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/71843/files/20130913083625-The_italian_context_-_small.jpg?1379086585"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the
last 30 years, groups in Italy – bird conservationist and hunter federations
alike – have worked hard to find solutions to migratory bird trapping and
shooting. However we think there is now a need to step back andproduce an<b>
independent country-wide overview</b> of social and cultural trends in the
practice of MBH, and the politics surrounding efforts to regulate it. There are
important questions where we lack thorough knowledge, such as: <i>In which regions of Italy are traditions of
hunting getting mixed in local politics? Are new technologies (e.g. song
play-back, mobile phones) changing the practices and impact of migratory bird
shooting and trapping? Are younger men still taking up hunting activities?</i></p>

preparing for a<b> rapid survey of popular
MBH areas in Italy</b>. We strongly believe that understanding the
current situation from inside is essential to better grasp the intertwined
dimensions of the issue, to analyse the different viewpoints, and to understand
the rationales underpinning this widespread practice. MBH is not only a problem
in Italy. We are convinced that findings from this research may later be used
as an important starting point that, with the addition of similar studies in other
countries, will help paint an overrall picture of the situation for the whole
Mediterranean. </p>
<p>Our
objectives are to understand: </p>
<p>·  <b>How
MBH is currently governed</b></p>
<p>·  <b>The
current issues and challenges</b></p>
<p>·  <b>How
different stakeholders (e.g., hunters, bird protectionists, local authorities)    are interplaying and/or conflicting</b></p>
<p>·  <b>Whether
the interest is increasing or decreasing among new generations </b></p>
<p>The
research is placed in a broader cultural context, in order to understand
whether there are differences between and within regions. </p>
<p>We are
going to drive around Italy by car to explore the key sites where this practice
is common. In each site we will meet with <b>Italian
experts</b> on the issue, main <b>authorities
</b>regulating hunting, local <b>hunter
associations</b>, local <b>bird
protectionist</b> groups, and <b>migratory
bird</b> <b>hunters</b> themselves.</p>
<p>The
project will start on Monday <b>September
23th</b> from the Southern tip of Italy (Sicily and Calabria regions),
and, depending on your support we will progressively move northwards to
investigate the main hunting areas in other regions, for example Campania and
Lombardy. We are hoping to explore multiple sites per region, spending at least
2-3 days in each site. If we achieve our funding goals, we are planning to be
working for a total of<b> 5 weeks</b>,
until the end of October. We will keep an online blog to update you on our
moves, insights and anecdotes throughout the journey.</p>
<p>The
findings of the research will be then written up for <b>publication</b> in a conservation policy journal, presented and
circulated to key conservation professionals, and incorporated into the online

With the support of Dr Paul Jepson, passionate birdwatcher and leading conservation scientist, we are going to carry out a country-wide overview study of the status and trends in migratory bird-hunting in Italy.

We both
have expertise in natural and social science research and in policy and
practice, especially with regard to conflicting issues and traditional
activities. We are well aware of the subtle cultural and historic differences
between Italian regions. We occupy a more neutral position and will listen carefully
to the perspectives of bird conservationists, hunters and the authorities, old
and young alike.

 In a recent National Geographic article, award winning author Jonathan Franzen calls for renewed action to tackle the issue of migratory bird hunting (MBH) in the Mediterranean. This is because, nearly 35 years after the EU Birds Directive, MBH is still widespread and its impact appears to be increasing as populations of European birds decline. 
The practice of MBH is deeply embedded in Italian culture and society, and is governed at the regional or local level. However, knowledge on actions and trends in hunting, as well as the politics surrounding the issue is fragmented. We want to try and change this. By touring hunting areas, we will compile and generate up- to- date information that will both raise its policy and public profile internationally and provide a resource for new thinking on solutions.

In the
1970s MBH was a key issue that generated popular support for bird conservation
and the creation of European conservation frameworks, notably the 1979 Birds
Directive. Today, there is growing awareness among conservation groups that the
issue needs to be revisited as MBH seems to be on the rise again. This seems to
be due to a combination of increasing ease
of accessibility (e.g. hunting tourism), new technologies (particularly song play-back), the Euro-zone crisis (economic hardship
leading to trapping and selling birds) and
political instability. Furthermore, there is a growing talk of deep
antagonism between hunters and bird-protectionists in parts of Europe and that
hunter perspectives are attracting populist political support locally.
The practice of MBH is deeply embedded in Italian culture and society, and is governed at the regional or local level. However, knowledge on actions and trends in hunting, as well as the politics surrounding the issue is fragmented. We want to try and change this. By touring hunting areas, we will compile and generate up- to- date information that will both raise its policy and public profile internationally and provide a resource for new thinking on solutions. 
Over the
last 30 years, groups in Italy – bird conservationist and hunter federations
alike – have worked hard to find solutions to migratory bird trapping and
shooting. However we think there is now a need to step back andproduce an
independent country-wide overview of social and cultural trends in the
practice of MBH, and the politics surrounding efforts to regulate it. There are
important questions where we lack thorough knowledge, such as: In which regions of Italy are traditions of
hunting getting mixed in local politics? Are new technologies (e.g. song
play-back, mobile phones) changing the practices and impact of migratory bird
shooting and trapping? Are younger men still taking up hunting activities?

We are
preparing for a rapid survey of popular
MBH areas in Italy. We strongly believe that understanding the
current situation from inside is essential to better grasp the intertwined
dimensions of the issue, to analyse the different viewpoints, and to understand
the rationales underpinning this widespread practice. MBH is not only a problem
in Italy. We are convinced that findings from this research may later be used
as an important starting point that, with the addition of similar studies in other
countries, will help paint an overrall picture of the situation for the whole
Mediterranean. 
Our
objectives are to understand: 
·  How
MBH is currently governed
·  The
current issues and challenges
·  How
different stakeholders (e.g., hunters, bird protectionists, local authorities)    are interplaying and/or conflicting
·  Whether
the interest is increasing or decreasing among new generations 
The
research is placed in a broader cultural context, in order to understand
whether there are differences between and within regions. 
We are
going to drive around Italy by car to explore the key sites where this practice
is common. In each site we will meet with Italian
experts on the issue, main authorities
regulating hunting, local hunter
associations, local bird
protectionist groups, and migratory
bird hunters themselves.
The
project will start on Monday September
23th from the Southern tip of Italy (Sicily and Calabria regions),
and, depending on your support we will progressively move northwards to
investigate the main hunting areas in other regions, for example Campania and
Lombardy. We are hoping to explore multiple sites per region, spending at least
2-3 days in each site. If we achieve our funding goals, we are planning to be
working for a total of 5 weeks,
until the end of October. We will keep an online blog to update you on our
moves, insights and anecdotes throughout the journey.
The
findings of the research will be then written up for publication in a conservation policy journal, presented and
circulated to key conservation professionals, and incorporated into the online
Atlas of Migratory Bird Hunting:
http://research.ouce.ox.ac.uk/migratorybirdhunting/

Your
contribution to this project will be essential for allowing us to persevere in
what we think will be an insightful and important study of the human side of
migratory bird hunting. Your assistance will go towards helping us cover our
petrol and travel, food and accommodation, as we cross the rural dust roads
from the South to the North of the Italian peninsula. We will keep our costs to
the bare minimum.

The
breakdown of our costs, for a total of £5,000, is as follows:
· £2,800
for food and accommodation (£35 per day per person, 40 days)
· £1,000
for petrol, insurance and highway tolls
· £500
for ferries (e.g. Calabria to Sicily, Sicily to Naples)
· £500
for equipment and maintenance costs (GPS, video-camera, batteries etc.)
· £200
for telephone and internet in the field

<p>This campaign was created on Indiegogo by me, the Communications and Development Director for White Buffalo Farm.  I have been helping Wayne since 2010.  We are now planning on converting the farm to new ownership as Wayne needs to retire.  But, we need to keep the farm running until it sells and in preparation for a fine hand-off!  Wayne and I, along with the farm's long list of supporters, would like to ensure a transition in keeping with the years of hard altruistic work Wayne and many others have offered in service for so many years.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Budget</h3>
<p>We start in our wood-fired starter green house, first 5000 tomatoes plants and then a month later 5000 squash seedlings. We need $500 for tomato seed, $500 for squash seed, $500 for chicks to replenish our laying hen brood and $500 for bees to pollinate the 20 acre orchard.  Wayne used to have his own bees, but one year he was stung so many times that he can no longer tend bees.  There is also peat moss, feed for the chicks and a fee to Indiegogo and paypal!</p>

Romer's Organics commission, keynoted a talk to western slope growers on organics in 1984 (to good effect as we all know), and was the first to sell pears to Earth's Best Baby Food and other well-known brands in organics, like Whole Foods and Natural Grocers!  Wayne grows using his own organic methods many varieties of pears, asian pears, cherries, apricots, plums, apples, greens, and all kinds of vegetables!</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you help will ensure the tastiest and freshest squash and tomatoes on the Western Slope.  We are well known around Colorado for our fine fruit!  And many on the Western Slope love our greens and cage-free eggs! </p>

Make this year a special one!  You will make this year a special one for the last free-roaming, organic farmer of his generation in Colorado!  The early organic pioneers of Colorado!  All the others have given up or gone bankrupt!  Wayne is a living legacy in Colorado's organic movement aka Mr. Organic and godfather of organics!   Wayne dedicated his last 40 years to making organics a reality in Colorado...and we can honor him by helping to make this year his best ever!  Wayne started the farmer's market in Telluride, served on Gov. Romer's Organics commission, keynoted a talk to western slope growers on organics in 1984 (to good effect as we all know), and was the first to sell pears to Earth's Best Baby Food and other well-known brands in organics, like Whole Foods and Natural Grocers!  Wayne grows using his own organic methods many varieties of pears, asian pears, cherries, apricots, plums, apples, greens, and all kinds of vegetables!
By contributing to this project, you help will ensure the tastiest and freshest squash and tomatoes on the Western Slope.  We are well known around Colorado for our fine fruit!  And many on the Western Slope love our greens and cage-free eggs! 

Please spread the word.  We have only one week to reach our goal and get the tomatoes started on time for this season!  THANK YOU! 
UPDATE!!!! Thanks to you we have reached our goal to plant tomatoes!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Drinkabrick is a new concrete construction system. It makes traditional Concrete Walls, but they have plastic air bubbles on the inside. They are laid out ordered and unexposed  inside the wall making the wall Lighter, more economical and providing Thermal insulation, Acoustic insulation and Humidity insulation. The interesting thing about this system is that the plastic air bubbles are PET water or soda containers. This way the Construction industry can utilize an almost free material (lowering construction costs) and at the same time giving a second utilization to used plastic containers that currently have a short life cycle, a low recycle percentage, takes hundreds of years to degrade and in a high percentage ends up polluting rivers and oceans.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Concepts</p>
<p>-Bottling companies start providing their water/soda inside a ""brick"" instead of bottles.</p>
<p>-The new container is nothing but a change of shape (same plastic, same production system)</p>
<p>-The shape is standard, thus the system can be certified</p>
<p>-The resistance and structure is taken by the concrete. Plastic only acts as internal mold (no structural request)</p>
<p>-The system can be reinforced with steel re bars (just like bricks and concrete bricks)</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are ready to produce the first units for certification. So we are asking for help to fund the following:</p>
<p>1-    The matrix or injection blowing mold and  The first 10.000.- units for testing One third goes to testing on a University, one third goes to a housing NPO for testing and the rest goes to building and standard material certification   (US$15.000.-)</p>
<p>2-     The first 3 official and standard material certifications. (Vertical Strength / Fire / Diagonal strength resistance (for earthquakes)) (US$25.000.-)</p>
<p>3-    The investing on Eco-design study (US$10.000.-)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>•    We’ll address the problem of plastic pollution of PET containers. These are the most common plastic containers  for water, juice and Soda and they are the standard for the bottling industry. Recycling covers around 5 to 6% of the production, while the remain either gets to dumps where it will take 200 to 1.000 years for them to decompose, or they end contaminating landscape , rivers or oceans being one of the biggest contributors to plastic pollution in the planet.  </p>
<p>•    Our organization will help Bottling companies by improving their product life cycle in terms of environmental impact, transportation cost, Social enterprise responsibility, differentiation, and marketing.</p>
<p>•    Besides giving bottle companies a solution for plastic contamination, we aim to create a positive impact in the environment as well as to create a positive impact in the housing deficit by providing an inexpensive building system on an almost free building material.  </p>
<p>•    Profit will be reinvested in PET container technology and environmental protection innovation.</p>

A very economic and hopefully abundant one since the bottling company pays it as a regular container and the second use is almost for free. Allowing people to save them for own use, donating them for people in need, or resell them at a very low cost. Current attempts for building with plastic bottles is not considered a construction system since it is not standard, thus it cannot be calculated and therefore approved by counties and it cannot be protected by insurance companies.   It also has a resistance to build with waste and with an element no suit for building. With our system, the bottling companies start delivering their product inside a “brick”.</p>
<p>•    We provide a second use for the container. A new PET container standard that allows  it to be reused in a second industry. The lifecycle of the product changes, instead of becoming trash that involves cost to get disposed, It receives second life.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>•    The problem of PET containers is numbers. While the standard in bottling has become  the PET bottle because of it resistance, lightness, toughness, transparency and cost, the problem relates to the amount of production. There is a huge problem that comes with the enormous amount of plastic bottles that remain after consumed their content. Just in Santiago 2.000.000.000 bottles are produced annually. In the US, 2.000.000 bottles are being consumed every 15 minutes. After a recycling closer to 6%, remaining bottles are considered  waste and have to be disposed in dumps, while an important percentage goes to polluting landscape, river and oceans. Collaterally, we aim to address the housing deficit, especially  in the underdeveloped countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It was until I started researching on the problem that I realize about the problem. The numbers  involved shocked me. I believe we are living in a moment where the human race has grown so much that while the industry thrives, the result of their actions impacts the Earth in a way that will a long time to mitigate. While the environmental issues are commonly known, as individuals we have very little impact on this mitigation. If by implementing this system we can  contribute to mitigate in part the pollution of landscape, rives and water bodies, we believe  we could find a lot of meaning in our work and lives.</p>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Jason and I've started this Campaign to raise money for South Slope Dog Run improvements / flood drainage system.The South Slope Dog Owners Association has adopted this park land located on 18th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. Our mission is to improve the quality of life in the South Slope area by creating and maintaining a dog friendly space and fostering positive interaction between dog owners and the community as a whole.  Go to http://www.southslopedog.org to learn more.
Recent improvements have been basic cleaning/maintenance, putting up fencing, laying wood chips, and building a double safety door.  
We raised $550 for the double safety door which was put in last summer.


Here are some of the things the Park is in desperate need of now:  
Drainage System  (IN PROGRESS)
New Bench
Dog Park Sign (IN PROGRESS)
Tools (rake, shovels, tool shed)
new surface?? (this needs a general consensus)

discovery of the Mishmi wren-babbler and when the bird was observed again. The Eastern Himalayas—the species’ only home—has the 
second-highest terrestrial biodiversity on the planet, making it a <i>bona 
fide</i> biodiversity hotspot. Yet because it is so remote and its 
infrastructure so rudimentary, the Eastern Himalayas is understudied and
 under-explored, leaving species to remain undiscovered or to go unseen 
for decades on end.<br/><br/>Gautam Surya, an associate conservation scientist with Global Wildlife Conservation, is headed to the remote forests of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh to conduct one of the first--and the most comprehensive--surveys of bird species, like the Mishmi wren-babbler and other ""lost"" species, in the Eastern Himalayas. Surya and his team aim to survey a wide range of altitudes to fully 
capture patterns of avian diversity, focused on the valleys created by 
five large rivers.<br/><br/>""We simply do not understand where species are located, and therefore it is almost impossible to do any meaningful conservation work,"" Surya says. ""Once we better understand the distribution of threatened species, we can start prioritizing areas for conservation action.""<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>Field expenses fall under three categories. The first is travel to and between different field sites--Surya is doing altitudinal transects along the main river valleys in the state. The second is field assistants--Surya hires a local person as a field assistant to assist in surveys, and also for safety in the forest. Finally, there is the everyday cost of living--food, shelter, etc. Surya stays in villages wherever possible to help forge a connection with the local people.<br/><br/><ul>
<li>$10 donation: Pays for an average day's food and shelter for Surya's team (Surya, a field assistant and a driver)</li>
<li>$30 donation: Covers the cost of a vehicle per day.</li>
<li>$100 donation: Covers the approximate salary for a local guide for a week.</li>
<li>$250 donation: Covers the cost of travel from Delhi to Surya's field site, round trip. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>First, you're supporting the continued existence of biodiversity. You're supporting efforts that will allow your children, and their children, to travel this part of the world to see all the wonderful things Surya gets to see. Secondly, you're supporting the people of the region. They are largely impoverished, and being tribals they are also somewhat cut off from most of the rest of Indian sociopolitical society. One of the main pathways out of poverty, in the short term, is through ecotourism--and ecotourism development requires that we better understand the places that people might go to see. In a broader sense, you are supporting science. Diversity is ultimately the source of all biology, and who knows what insights await us from a careful study of this region. What might we discover about genetics...or medicine...or resilience to climate change...or simply some cool natural history? <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There are a few issues related to working in this area. To begin with, it's disputed territory (administered by India but claimed by China), and therefore has a large military presence--and they're not generally thrilled about strange folks with binoculars. There are also issues with insurgents in specific locations. Elephants are a presence and a threat in lower-elevation forest, and snakes are also numerous. The weather is a big challenge as well--the monsoon causes a lot of landslides, roads often are blocked, river unfordable, etc. And then there are all the minor inconveniences, from obtaining drinkable water to the leeches and biting flies. <br/><br/>As GWC's conservation associate scientist in this part of the world, Surya has already successfully maneuvered these challenges and will use those same skills on this leg of the expedition. ""As a kid growing up in India, the Northeast was always a mysterious and far-away place that I always wanted to visit,"" Surya said. ""I was also a birdwatcher, and when I got my first field guide, I flipped through it eagerly--and found that most of the coolest birds were only found there. I've been wanting to work in Arunachal Pradesh since I was about 11--and now I am!""<br/>

Since our founding, we've ever done so many things to contribute the maintenance of global environment. And now we've found another way to help our planet. We can't do this without you.</p><h3><strong>THE IDEA</strong></h3><p>Our new factory is under construction right now. Then, we've decided to make it an environment-friendly site with a bunch of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide which is a cause of global warming. By this, we'll have nature that we have been losing in the city.

Since our founding, we've ever done so many things to contribute the maintenance of global environment. And now we've found another way to help our planet. We can't do this without you.THE IDEAOur new factory is under construction right now. Then, we've decided to make it an environment-friendly site with a bunch of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide which is a cause of global warming. By this, we'll have nature that we have been losing in the city.

<h3>What is permaculture?</h3>
<p>""Permaculture is the conscious design of 'cultivated' 
ecosystems that have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural
 ecosystems. It is a harmonious integration of people into the landscape
 in such a way that the land grows in richness, productivity and 
aesthetic beauty"".  
<i>Washburn TN PDC</i><br/></p>
<p>The founder of permaculture, Bill Mollison, describes it this way: ""Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system.""  <br/></p>
<p>The word <i>permaculture</i> originally referred to ""permanent agriculture"", but was expanded to stand also for ""permanent culture"", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system. (Wikipedia)</p>

</div></div>","Who we are...

We are Angela, Ivan, Manuel and Gio, a Canadian-Colombian family passionate about holistic wellness, permaculture and eco-living.  Five months ago, we dropped our Canadian lives and took the plunge to live out our dreams in the beautiful Colombian Andes.



We found and acquired a 4-hectare property at the base of the snow capped mountains national park (Parque de los Nevados) near the city of Pereira.  Our land is surrounded by fresh spring waterways, forest and guadual (giant bamboo), with breathtaking views of forested mountainside.  We have a variety of fruit trees growing, including bananas, oranges, mandarins, mango, lemons, grapefruit, avocado, soursop, plantain, papaya and guava.  



We have been independently studying the art of permaculture for the past two years with a plan to live in a more sustainable way.  Ivan left his career as an Ironworker and Engineer, where he commuted 3 hours per day, to work the land and get back to nature.  Angela transferred her yoga, Reiki and Thai Massage practice from the busy city to the lush green countryside with a desire to build a holistic centre and host retreats.  With over 24 years of yoga practice, Angela wishes to share the incredible benefits of yoga and meditation on a larger scale.  Along with tending the land and working on individual projects, Ivan teaches at a local university, while Angela teaches English and promotes her wellness services. Unfortunately, the money they earn is only enough to cover the existing mortgage payments and current living expenses. The budget doesn't stretch to cover future development of this project.


We believe that the world desperately needs change, current systems are not serving the majority of the population or the planet.  We feel that permaculture is the answer to many problems of the world.  




What is permaculture?
""Permaculture is the conscious design of 'cultivated' 
ecosystems that have the diversity, stability, and resilience of natural
 ecosystems. It is a harmonious integration of people into the landscape
 in such a way that the land grows in richness, productivity and 
aesthetic beauty"".  
Washburn TN PDC
The founder of permaculture, Bill Mollison, describes it this way: ""Permaculture is a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system.""  
The word permaculture originally referred to ""permanent agriculture"", but was expanded to stand also for ""permanent culture"", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system. (Wikipedia)


What we're doing...
In the past five months, we've been working hard to develop the land and design our system.  We've been tending to the plants; managing the guadual; digging terraces; building animal housing, an outdoor kitchen and a dry toilet system.

Our overall goal is to offer this beautiful place to the world and have a platform to share information and host workshops and retreats, as well as hostel accommodation for learners and travelers.  In order to achieve this goal, we have a far way to go.  We still need to build cabins, workshop space, facilities for guests, grey water systems, solar shower, more animal housing, among a number of other projects.  This is where you come in.  With your help we can turn this dream into a reality, sharing this wonderful way of life and helping to heal the planet and the self.

   
Budget...

Our total goal budget is $36,000 USD.  This will allow us to build the three cabins (using bamboo), bathroom facilities, a greenhouse, additional animal housing, workshop and kiosk; and provide power generation (hydroelectricity from the creek), grey water systems and a water well.  Some funds will also be allocated to driveway improvements and advertising.

If we don't reach our complete goal, we aim to build at least one cabin with facilities and ideally a space for workshops.  If we do reach our goal, we anticipate completion of these projects by August 2016. If we raise more than our goal, we have a lot of great ideas; from expanding into an eco-village to launching environmental conservation programs and reforestation of the area.

Stretch Goals...
. with an extra $3,000 we will build a natural swimming pond for our guests. 
· with an extra $5,000 we will build an additional cabin for guests.
· with an extra $10,000 we will upgrade all the cabins incorporating sacred geometric architecture.
· with an extra $20,000 we will adopt the 1km long creek which runs through our property and that of others, ensuring that no untreated sewage, residue waters or rubbish flows downstream.
· with an extra $25,000 we will donate 1 acre of pasture to the community with the goal to reforest it with native trees and turn it into a natural reserve for all to enjoy (if similar perk is not claimed).

· with an extra $40,000 we will pay off our existing mortgage for the land and be able to focus 100% on our conservation and permaculture projects.  
· with an extra $100,000 we will acquire the neighbouring land to expand our project and open opportunities for an eco-village.






Perks...
We would like to invite you to come and stay at Anukara Eco-Cultura and experience the magic and tranquility for yourself.  Imagine waking up to the beauty of the Colombian countryside before taking in a yoga class or a Thai massage; drinking a rich organic, local coffee or tea while enjoying the multitude of birds and butterflies; swimming in the local spring fed river; or learning some new skills at one of our workshops.  



However if you cannot travel to Colombia, we have many other options for our supporters.  We are offering a range of unique perks to suit a variety of budgets and situations, from naming a tree or conservation plot to guided audio meditations, permaculture resource guides and recipe e-books - with some of the healthiest and most delicious dishes we know of.   For travelers, we're offering all inclusive 10-day retreats and services.   Your contribution will make this all possible.


The Impact You can feel satisfied in knowing that your contribution is making a huge impact for the good of the planet.  Our goal is to educate and influence future generations, teach them to embrace nature and care for the earth.  We want to create community and share healthier ways of living both locally and internationally.  Every dollar you give will help to bring back the natural balance and spread the awareness that is so desperately needed in this day and age.


Through Yoga, Thai Massage and Reiki practices, our aim is to bring the balance and connection back to the individual through self-healing, stress reduction, and personal development.  In this way, we can better connect to our environment and the people around us and be inspired to make a difference in the world.

NOW BACK TO CAMPAIGN...






. 

The Birth of the MOOPsquad...

Hello and welcome! Thank you for visiting! I am Sylvie, and I am part of the MOOPsquad! Please take a look at our incredible team of MOOPagents working hard to make the world a better place!

The MOOPsquad is a movement, one that is now growing fast! From my heart, and from the collective heart of all beings, I express our deepest gratitude for all the hours our team invest to beautify our world.



The challenge we are passionate about solving is one of the most urgent challenges we face everyday. We did our best to keep this brief and provide you with a message of hope. I kindly request that you now invest 10 minutes to find out about what we are doing.


I was fortunate to be raised in a family where I learned self-responsibility. As a little girl I was deeply involved and mentored through the girl scout network. Living with honor, keeping our world clean, and taking responsibility for my actions was ingrained in my DNA. As I grew older; performing, theatre, event production, and full time study at Berkeley kept me quite busy, but never enough to extinguish my desire for a better world.

Today I have a vision for each human to respect our earth at the highest level, and treat her with the respect she deserves. Our worldâ€™s trash problems became crystal clear to me while doing some world travel to Costa Rica in 2001.









.


All the little things I had seen over the years had piled up, quite literally! When I witnessed trash being thrown out of the bus windows by children, trash being thrown in the rivers, and trash piling up on the beaches, a heavy heartache kicked me into gear to take action. I began yearning to make something happen.


Soon thereafter in 2002, I went to Burning Man, and was introduced to MOOP (Matter Out of Place). The Leave No Trace philosophy was in direct alignment with my dream and revived my full passion and intense drive for our cause. This is the micro community  that I have since lived, and itâ€™s now time to inspire, share, and engage the macro community in these ways of being.

My overall goal has become to make a world impact on humanitiesâ€™ general behavior around MOOP. The past methods were obviously not working. The solution is not another boring educational about facts on MOOP. Parents and even kids have now heard enough to make them numb. Humanitiesâ€™ full attention is required now, we MUST wake up.
Put simply, humanities thought patterns & behaviors around MOOP require an upgrade!


I knew I had to invent a concept that was FUN, ENGAGING, and fully utilizing the MAGIC that flows while connecting with other beings. The idea required creativity, imagination, play, event production skills, and a lot of spirit power! This is how the MOOPsquad was born.





.


As the MOOPsquad, we are a passionate core group of female performers. While being dressed up in cool suits, twirling, dancing, and holding our MOOPwands like guns we passionately utilize a deep seeded feminine power that evokes a magnetic and mysterious curious sensation that inspires lasting actions within our audience. While we have them captivated, we politely show them itâ€™s actually â€œcoolâ€ to pickup MOOP.From our efforts, we see heads turn and mouths drop in amazement!



""Since theMOOPsquadâ€™s birth in 2002, we now have about 20 MOOPagents passionately serving the cause. We have inspired over 100,000 people, and through normal wear and tear we have gone through over 200 MOOPwands!""

With a population of over 7 billion it is our vision to enroll over a million MOOPsquad agents to inspire this behavior change that is required for humanities future success on Earth.the MOOPsquad Mission: Eradicate MOOP on  Planet Earth




Why you care about this...People care about Eradicating MOOP on Planet Earth because it gives relief to a discomfort & hope to a heart ache that we all share on some subconscious level.Our challenge is now so big that most people look the other way when they see MOOP. Its a common belief that MOOP clean up is another persons job and totally deny the MOOP they see everyday. Our hearts are required to be reactivated. Facts donâ€™t activate our hearts to care. Deep down, we all know if we all help we can make huge strides together. 


""People care about what we are doing because this is about our planet. Itâ€™s not about me, it is not about our MOOPagents, this is about OUR world and for all of US!""




.

At the moment we are fully invested and no other major fundraising has ever been done. To be honest, itâ€™s actually been hard for me to ask anyone for money, and I have drained all my extra money into this venture. Our clean world is my passion. It's for me, for us and for our children to have a more beautiful world.The GREAT news is that we are NOT a startup with a good idea...
after many years, I can assure you that this actually works!


Calls, emails, and text messages regularly come in that are filled with gratitude and proof that after seeing us do our magic, people are coming home after a night out with MOOP in their pockets! People who would not have otherwise done so are cleaning up after themselves and their fellow strangers!Now it is time to raise the bar! It is time to launch a world wide campaign!



.Why are we fundraising?Itâ€™s time to go back to the roots of my discovery. It's time to spread the message in one of the places that is most pristine, most virgin, most diverse, and in most need of assistance. We are fundraising for a 14 day journey into Costa Rica, with a goal to touch the lives of 1000â€™s of people and plant seeds that will inspire viral behavior change!



.



Welcome to MOOPmission: Costa Rica!

We have a 6 MOOPagent, 14 day MOOPmission planned to visit over 10 cities where we will be facing the beaches, jungles, and rivers that are in dire need of attention. Through our actions we will be performing and inspiring change in the local communities everyday! We will also have meetings with local press and plant the seeds for integration of our photo shoots in their upcoming publications.





 The MOOPsquad tour will culminate at the Envision arts/sustainability festival where we have been invited to lead a portion of the Green Team. At this festival alone there will be over 1,000 local and international attendees that we will have the pleasure to inspire!


Why would you give?People donate for various reasons:Some people feel this is a cool idea- they desire being part of this movement and will help vicariously through their financial support. Because it has worked for us on a smaller level, it can work on a really BIG level, so they support to be part of a solution and to be part of a vision that truly serves humanities existence on earth.Some people are waking up to our grim reality and seeing that we MUST change. These people may lack the time to help, or  they may even lack a lot of money to help, in any case they see and deeply feel the calling to support this cause with anything they can.Some people are blessed with financial abundance and they give because they believe we MUST collaborate and share our own abundance with causes that help humanity. They understand that the MOOPsquad is not a huge financial endeavor just yet, but their abundance can serve in a place where it is in dire need.No matter at what level you choose to give, we will honor your gift with a special MOOPsquad Badge of Honor.Whatever your reason is for giving, we desire for you to know that we appreciate your assistance so much. Without assistance from people like you, we canâ€™t keep doing this forever. By helping us now, our Earth will be a cleaner place, and we will be able to sow the seeds that continually inspire new behaviors that create ever lasting MOOPconsciousness in each person we inspire.Our Team & NetworkIn addition to our strong passion, we have a core team of 6 MOOPagents. Our core team have skills that range from media creation, event production, aerial and fire performing, to environmental specialists.







.

We are also part of a larger sisterhood called the Beckys, which expands our MOOPsquad to over 50 high caliber performers.



Our network of friends extend in to some of todayâ€™s most popular Los Angeles & San Fransisco Musicians, Djâ€™s and artists, as well as strong support from some of todayâ€™s biggest thinking and action oriented social entrepreneurs.How much are we raising?We are now raising $10,022 for MOOPmission:Costa Rica.How will the money be used?We will be using the money raised for:
Airline tickets to Costa Rica for 6 MOOPagents
Accommodations at safe hotels
Food
Transportation
100+ Moop Wands
Marketing materials: stickers, business cards

Post production assistance for video and print products




Due to the current state of our planet, we are expecting to be raising much more than $10,022.

With YOUR help...we certainly do not expect to raise less than our goal, in any case...here is what each level of funding will allow for:


At 2k, all marketing expenses are paid for, and two MOOPagents go to support the Envision Festival as the MOOPsquad.


At 4k, some Costa Rica community outreach is possible, and three MOOPagents do MOOPmission: Costa Rica


At 6k, the full Costa Rica community outreach program is possible and four MOOPagents do MOOPmission: Costa Rica


At $7,500 the MOOPsquad will be able to activate 10 additional local MOOPtroop (volunteers) at the Envision Festival for daily MOOPmissons


At 10k, the full vision of MOOPmission: Costa Rica will be a reality with our 6 full-time MOOPagents ready to lead!



We have much bigger goals that extend far past Costa Rica. We have a full US tour planned, innovative technology to develop, and the vision to be able to purchase and share 1000's of MOOPwands with our community of supporters. Some of our plans include the ""Becky Saves the World Tour"", SXSW, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle, BOOM (Portugal) and Burning Man!


When we raise more than the $10,022 it will give us the opportunity to get a head start on future fundraising.


What will the result of MOOPmission: Costa Rica be?After we get back from Costa Rica we will have inspired 1000â€™s of people to look at MOOP in a whole new way.

We will bring back stories and adventures that will strengthen our bond with our cause, and provide more fuel to continue. From our missions scouting for MOOP in the jungle and our interactivity in the surrounding communities, we will have cool MOOPsquad photography that we can create powerful print media with. We will share our photography and story with local & international press. We will also have connected with dozens of people that desire doing what we are doing, and they will create their own MOOPsquad troops! Through documenting this journey we will be able to complete our proven system that can be duplicated in cities all over the world for all future MOOPsquad MOOPagents to follow.


This is a movement!
MOOPmission: Costa Rica is for ALL of us

We feel that we have lined up a perfect opportunity, and now we are requesting your support.

Although mercury is no longer refined there, the residents of the city continue to be exposed to this toxin on a daily basis. The problem is exacerbated as most residents in this city of 35,000 live in homes that they have constructed with mercury-laden adobe.</p>
<p>Since 2009, the non-profit Environmental Health Council has conducted research on this problem. Based on The World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) benchmarks 45 of the 60 homes in our study require remediation due to mercury vapor and toxic dust emanating from the unsealed interior walls and earthen floors. Almost all homes in our study are led by women who have children living there, and both groups are especially at risk of mercury poisoning.  <br/></p>
<p>We have recently completed a remediation plan for the city, and are now ready to begin with a pilot project. Our goal is to remediate the four most contaminated homes in the study by applying cement stucco to interior walls and pouring a cement floor. This largely eliminates interior sources of contaminated dust and dirt and, based on the effective use of cement as a vapor barrier, we expect that it will significantly reduce or eliminate off gassing of mercury vapor from the walls and floors.  As we do our work, we will monitor contamination in the home to ensure the efficacy of the work and make adjustments as necessary.<br/></p>
<p>Our team is bi-national and multi-disciplinary, including Peruvian and American experts in medicine, mercury remediation, public health, anthropology, biostatistics, community development, and environmental engineering. The results of our work have been published in peer-reviewed scientific publications, and our plan and approach follow standard remedial approaches.<br/></p>
<p>The participants in our project are also our collaborators, and the poorest of the poor in Huancavelica. Many have been living in their toxic homes for decades, breathing mercury vapors and ingesting contaminated dust. Our work will not only help them lead healthier lives, but serve as a model for a larger scale intervention.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, no one has ever studied mercury-contaminated adobe, or done any remediation work in the city of Huancavelica.</p>
<p><b>Help us, Help Huanca and Be A Part Of History!</b></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Each house costs about $1,300 to remediate.

<p>Sponsors will receive the rewards such as a certificate, HelpHuanca! mugs, and Peruvian handicrafts depending on the amount of their donation:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p>The greatest challenge we face is the scale of the problem in Huancavelica.

<p>We are ready for the challenge!

<h3>What is this about?</h3>
<p>While photography is my medium, my love is for the wilderness. I feel very lucky to live in a place like Washington, because of the beautiful, jagged snow-capped peaks and majestic volcanoes that dominate the horizons here in Washington.</p>
<p>The more I discovered, the more I came to love Washington.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I also became more concerned by the amount of devastation we have, even here in Washington, with coal plants, gold mines, oil refineries, and far too much traffic.</p>
<p>Photographing the world around us isn't just about making art. It's also an attempt to make a difference.</p>
<p>Last year I climbed Kilimanjaro for myself. Now I'm going to climb Mount Rainier for all of us.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding is going to the American Lung Association, the organizers behind the Climb for Clean Air.</p>
<p>The American Lung Association is using the money to combat big things like pollution, but also small things that affect individual people, like ConnieD whose building manager refuses to evict residents who have a meth lab in the building. It's affecting Connie's health, and even the police aren't helping. Yet the American Lung Association is actively seeking to hire staff in her area so that they can help her.</p>
<p>Some of the contributions will be paying for the gifts I'm offering. Everything else is going to the American Lung Association; I won't make any profit from this campaign. I'm just going to climb a mountain and document the adventure in pictures and video, to tell the story of our trip, the volunteers who are helping us train for the climb, and the other climbers who seeking to do the same thing that I am.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>My commitment to the American Lung Association is $4000, and so far I have raised $1000.</p>
<p>What you get is a print. Not just any print, but a beautiful, fine art giclee print from White Crane Photography, printed by the master printers at Giclee on Metal. These makes great gifts; if you have friends or family suffering from emphysema or asthma or who are environmentalists, you could contribute in their name and send them the print to remind them of what we're doing.</p>
<p>I'll sign every print, and include a thank you postcard for your help.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that money is tight these days, and that not everyone reading this can spare money to help out.</p>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, but you would like to help reduce pollution and emphysema, and help ConnieD get rid of her meth lab neighbors, then pass the word and encourage your friends to help.</p>

<p>In January 2015 I want to set
off and spend three months looking for monkeys in Congo. It will be an
<b>adventurous expedition</b> by car, motorbike, or bicycle, but mainly in a dug-out
canoe and on foot through <b>extremely remote</b> areas. A Congolese assistent will go with me on the
whole trip. We will ask the people in the villages whether they know this red
monkey and then we will head off, hiking through the forest, searching along the
rivers. We will hike from one faraway village to the next, covering four forest
blocks, a total of <b>300 or more kilometers</b>. We will bring our tents, cook on wood
fire and we will have to rely fully on local food supplies. During my last
10-month stay in the field I learned <b>Lingala</b>, so I don't have a problem talking
to the people in Congo.<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1018143/files/20141115161544-Survey_schedule_routes.jpg?1416096944"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;"">What do we expect to find?</span><br/></p><p>The
inaccessible swamps red colobus monkeys live in might give them some level of
protection against hunting. And if no scientist ever goes there, we have no
data and it might be they are not as endangered as we think. But that’s the
optimistic view. More likely, these monkeys are under <b>severe threat from the
commercial bushmeat trade</b>. Hunting is traditionally part of the Central African
culture, but nowadays a lot of meat is smoked and transported to the cities. Traders
use rivers as highways and in the habitat of Bouvier’s red colobus monkeys
there are a lot of big rivers. Red colobus monkeys are also extremely
vulnerable to hunting. They are among the largest monkeys in Africa, so they
are a good kill for hunters. They live in large, noisy groups and are not
particularly good at detecting predators, or hunters.<br/><br/></p>

The species has not been seen by scientists since the 1970s and virtually nothing is known about them. If you google it, you will not find a single picture. Actually, the species is largely ignored in the literature. A single report from 1949 gives some information about its distribution and only three museum specimens are known that have been collected about 100 years ago. They are reported to live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of rivers in very inaccessible habitat. They might be extinct, but we just don’t know. Help us fill in this gap. Help us find this elusvie red colobus monkey!Expedition outline
In January 2015 I want to set
off and spend three months looking for monkeys in Congo. It will be an
adventurous expedition by car, motorbike, or bicycle, but mainly in a dug-out
canoe and on foot through extremely remote areas. A Congolese assistent will go with me on the
whole trip. We will ask the people in the villages whether they know this red
monkey and then we will head off, hiking through the forest, searching along the
rivers. We will hike from one faraway village to the next, covering four forest
blocks, a total of 300 or more kilometers. We will bring our tents, cook on wood
fire and we will have to rely fully on local food supplies. During my last
10-month stay in the field I learned Lingala, so I don't have a problem talking
to the people in Congo.What do we expect to find?The
inaccessible swamps red colobus monkeys live in might give them some level of
protection against hunting. And if no scientist ever goes there, we have no
data and it might be they are not as endangered as we think. But that’s the
optimistic view. More likely, these monkeys are under severe threat from the
commercial bushmeat trade. Hunting is traditionally part of the Central African
culture, but nowadays a lot of meat is smoked and transported to the cities. Traders
use rivers as highways and in the habitat of Bouvier’s red colobus monkeys
there are a lot of big rivers. Red colobus monkeys are also extremely
vulnerable to hunting. They are among the largest monkeys in Africa, so they
are a good kill for hunters. They live in large, noisy groups and are not
particularly good at detecting predators, or hunters.
What we needFor this three-month expedition
we need about $5000 in total. We need money for:
transport, lodging and food
salaries of the
assistant, trackers, porters and cooks
research permits and permission of the village chiefs to enter their forests
some of
the necessary equipment, like a solar panel to charge gps batteries
See the detailed project proposal for more information on the bugdet, aims and planning of this expedition. Travelling and working in remote areas in Congo is not an easy thing and a lot of obstacles have to be overcome. At any time it is possible that the expedition will have to be cancelled because of security or health issues, to name just two obstacles. However, I build up a good amount of field experience and I am confident that the expedition aims will be fulfilled, hopefully finding Bouvier's red colobus.PerksWe will greatly appreciate your support, in any way. In return we can offer you a number of special perks. See the details on the right side of this page.
For 25 dollar Lieven will send you a postcard from Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of Congo. 
Donate 50 dollar and we will send you a package with pictures, videos and unique sound recordings from the forest, hopefully including red colobus monkeys. 
100 dollar equals the same multimedia package, plus a unique, locally-made Congolese bracelet. 

For 300 dollar Lieven will come to your living room, zoo or institution to give an exciting talk about the expedition.


Conservationists have been
writing for a long time that an expedition for Bouvier’s red colobus has utmost
priority, but to date no one ever went to Congo. Help us fill in this gap. Help
us find the elusive red colobus monkey. Matondo mingi na
bino. Or for those who don't speak Lingala: Thank you very much!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

especially so from spring to fall, where it can reach 100 degrees in the mid 
summer. Not only is it impractical to try and clean your own city-issued 
trashcan here, but in most places it's actually illegal to dump the trash 
residue and waste water into the city drains and municipal water system. Who 
wants to get fined for cleaning their trashcan?</p><p>And let's face it, who in their own right mind would even want to clean a 
trashcan in South Georgia  in 100-degree weather anyway? I didn't, and I knew other 
people didn't want to either!</p><p>I discovered all that I needed was the right garbage can cleaning machine, a 
truck, and some advertising materials to let people know about his service, to 
get this business going. I could easily see that offering this service to people 
living in mid to high-income residential areas was a no-brainer. And I found out 
it was true!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways We Can Help</h3><p></p><p>Our natural solvents kill 99% of all known germs, fungi and viruses.

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP The ImpactI did a lot of research and found that trash can cleaning was virtually 
untapped in the US, and also where I live. I am located in South Georgia and 
we have a lot of stinkin' trashcans here. It's sunny most of the year, but 
especially so from spring to fall, where it can reach 100 degrees in the mid 
summer. Not only is it impractical to try and clean your own city-issued 
trashcan here, but in most places it's actually illegal to dump the trash 
residue and waste water into the city drains and municipal water system. Who 
wants to get fined for cleaning their trashcan?And let's face it, who in their own right mind would even want to clean a 
trashcan in South Georgia  in 100-degree weather anyway? I didn't, and I knew other 
people didn't want to either!I discovered all that I needed was the right garbage can cleaning machine, a 
truck, and some advertising materials to let people know about his service, to 
get this business going. I could easily see that offering this service to people 
living in mid to high-income residential areas was a no-brainer. And I found out 
it was true!Other Ways We Can HelpOur natural solvents kill 99% of all known germs, fungi and viruses. We recycle all water and comply with all EPA regulations.

<p></p>
<p>The
Worcester Spinning and Finishing Company site is a former textile
manufacturing, finishing and dying mill classified as a Superfund site by the
EPA. In addition to the possible human and environmental health issues posed by
the hazardous wastes present at this site, the mill building itself is
condemned due to a fire and the site is not being developed or repaired by the
current owners. In order to move ahead with the reclamation and cleanup of this
site, we need to evaluate the extent of the chemical and hazardous waste damage
by completing our own Phase I and II environmental assessments. Only after
completing these assessments, can we know how we should proceed with the cleanup
and restoration of the site.</p>
<p>You can view more photos of the site at <a href=""http://www.lcatrust.org/programs/kettle/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lcatrust.org/programs/kettle</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We need funds to begin the assessment process of this land.  We have potential funding sources for the BIG CLEANUP but the specific cleanup needs are essential to pursue those funds.</p>
<p>Because
this mill is listed as a Superfund site by the EPA, it is highly likely that
there is hazardous waste contamination present, but it is the extent of the
damage that is unknown. With the information provided by the assessments, we
can better plan the future of this project and account for such factors as how
long it will take to restore this site, how much future funding we will need to
clean up the site and complete a restoration, which chemicals or hazardous
wastes are present and which professionals have the proper expertise to deal
with them.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our
ultimate goal is to reclaim a dangerous and hazardous waste site and convert it
into a site for conservation, recreation and possible renewable energy
production. Reclamation will ensure that this site is converted to positive
environmental and societal use and protect it from further contamination or
from being bought by developers and converted into more urban sprawl. This will
stop the degradation and loss of ecosystems and habitats in a culturally and
historically significant area. The site also contains a dam and a pond. The
possibility of restoring and using this dam as a renewable energy resource is
being explored, as well as the use of the mill building area and the pond for a
land-based and partially aquatic-based solar panel farm. </p>

<h2><strong>We will be conducting food and clothing drives for the victims of wildfires in Colorado every weekend this summer<span>! If you would like to help volunteer or donate, please visit our facebook page, like or follow us, and send us a message! We are always in a different location, and we're always looking for help!</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong><span><br/></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>We are looking for families to sponsor. If you have been affected by the wildfires - please contact us. We may be able to provide shelter, food, clothing and more - with no questions asked!</span></strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Don't you wish that you could actually volunteer when a wildfire breaks out in your area? Instead of just donating money to an organization that has the fire as one of their projects - wouldn't it be nice if an organization was dedicated just to wildfires?</p>
<p>We will be the first regional volunteer fire fighting agency in the nation dedicated solely to wildfires in the southwest region of the United States. </p>
<p>We will train regular citizens - such as yourself - to become volunteer firefighters and support staff for wildfires and the communities affected by them.</p>
<p>Our teams will focus on the following areas:</p>
<p>Property notification of wildfires and evacuations</p>
<p>Support personnel for burnout operations and digout operations</p>
<p>Fuel removal from forest beds and surrounding areas</p>
<p>Private help with animal rescues during evacuations</p>
<p>Road closures and land closures</p>
<p>Food and beverage support for fire personnel</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By providing these support services to the local community, and the fire departments - the professional fire teams can focus more on fighting the actual fire and the fireline - instead of all of the secondary duties required to make an operation successful.</p>
<p>By having more volunteers available at the start of a fire, we can reduce property loss, reduce loss of life to humans and animals, evacuate areas more quickly, and put out the fire faster!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is our first round of funding - with this round of funding, we will complete the following:</p>
<p>~Build a new website for the company</p>
<p>~Find a location in which we can headquarter, expand, and store materials and equipment as needed</p>
<p>~Register a new phone</p>
<p>~Setup our basic office</p>
<p>~Begin recruiting citizens for firefighter training</p>
<p> </p>
<p>People that donate will be able to help with the following:</p>
<p>~Design aspects of the website - including live alerts of fires and evacuations, memberships and newsletter design, and more.</p>
<p>~Location - HELP US FIND A HOME! We need to find a location where we can answer phones, store fire equipment (coats, pants, suits, maybe a few vehicles)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once we have our first round of funding complete, and we are setup - we will begin accepting donations to expand and begin training of citizens to become volunteer firefighters. We would like to donate to local fire stations for them to provide the training for our organization.</p>
<p>We will approach all local and regional fire departments and open training in multiple locations, multiple times per year - to meet citizen needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We will be accepting material and equipment donations in a very short time. When we begin accepting these donations, we will be looking for the following:</p>
<p>~Fire equipment - including but not limited to suits, helmets, axes, chainsaws, boots, gloves, masks, oxygen tanks, breathers, re-breathers, etc.</p>
<p>~Vehicles - The larger the vehicle, and the better gas mileage, the better. We will provide transportation to and from the fires for the volunteers fighting the fires. We will also provide local pickup points in local towns to reduce travel times for each citizen.</p>
<p>~Office Equipment - We would much rather furnish our office with donated items instead of spending donations on furniture! If you have a desk, newer computer, printer, calendar - anything that you think may help in a fire chief's office - please let us know!</p>
<p>Support Equipment - Tables, cups, plates, silverware, napkins, non-perishable food items, unopened baby wipes, coffee and tea dispensers, caution tape, orange construction cones, emergency vehicle lights (flashing lights to place on a vehicle, preferably magnetic)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>IF WE REACH OUR GOAL EARLY - </strong>We will find a location asap - have our office setup asap, get our website live within 7 days - and begin our second round of funding - OUR GOAL IS TO BE LIVE AND START TRAINING BY AUGUST 1ST!</p>
<p><strong>IF WE RAISE MORE THAN OUR GOAL - </strong>This money will go directly into finding volunteers, and singing up members for training. The faster we have volunteers - the faster we can fight fires!</p>
<p> </p>

~Fire equipment - including but not limited to suits, helmets, axes, chainsaws, boots, gloves, masks, oxygen tanks, breathers, re-breathers, etc.
~Vehicles - The larger the vehicle, and the better gas mileage, the better. We will provide transportation to and from the fires for the volunteers fighting the fires. We will also provide local pickup points in local towns to reduce travel times for each citizen.
~Office Equipment - We would much rather furnish our office with donated items instead of spending donations on furniture! If you have a desk, newer computer, printer, calendar - anything that you think may help in a fire chief's office - please let us know!
Support Equipment - Tables, cups, plates, silverware, napkins, non-perishable food items, unopened baby wipes, coffee and tea dispensers, caution tape, orange construction cones, emergency vehicle lights (flashing lights to place on a vehicle, preferably magnetic)
 
IF WE REACH OUR GOAL EARLY - We will find a location asap - have our office setup asap, get our website live within 7 days - and begin our second round of funding - OUR GOAL IS TO BE LIVE AND START TRAINING BY AUGUST 1ST!
IF WE RAISE MORE THAN OUR GOAL - This money will go directly into finding volunteers, and singing up members for training. The faster we have volunteers - the faster we can fight fires!

<p>The disposable lifestyle is what Americans have championed since the post-war economic boom of last century.   But now as we approach the limitations of those choices, we're recognizing that more sustainable lifestyle and business practices are necessary.  These changes require recycling more (rates are on the rise!) and using less stuff (unfortunately, our consumption rates also continue to rise) -- so this is the part we’re helping with!</p>
<p>The team at Beeco has developed an innovative consumer loyalty program that incentivizes people for taking small acts to reduce waste while shopping, and promotes retailers who are sustainable corporate citizens! </p>
<p>Beeco's program promotes that individual small acts can add-up to <strong>Big Rewards</strong> for you and for our environment!</p>
<p>With the <strong><em>BeecoSmart<sup>TM</sup> Sustainability Rewards</em></strong><strong><em> Program</em></strong>, you can earn points toward rewards for something as simple as bringing your reusable bag or mug when shopping at your favorite stores. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 240px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.iaccessmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/BeeCoBee-mug-web.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Beeco's revolutionary program of rewarding people for using less stuff is simple to use.  For example, our system can be easily deployed in coffee shops and consumer goods &amp; food stores so that patrons who bring their own bag or mug may log their reward activity by entering a user id or scanning a QR code in the Beeco user interface.  Shoppers feel good about earning points and increasing loyalty to participating stores, and for helping the environment!  Points turn into rewards offered by the Network of Participating Retailers for reducing the use of single-use disposable products and the waste they generate.  </p>
<p>We are very excited to start our first municipal partnership with the City of Boulder, Colorado who will promote the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Program</em></strong> to residents and shoppers throughout the city starting this spring. The <strong><em>BeecoSmart Program </em></strong>is already being piloted at a coffee shop with demonstrated success. We are also in discussions with several other cities in Colorado, and look forward to taking the program nationwide after we have reached a critical mass!</p>
<p>Your support will help us provide the sales and development momentum to ensure this first rollout of the program is successfully deployed in as many stores as we can, so that we can spread this sustainability program to other cities and communities.   The more we increase awareness about how simple and rewarding it is to use less, the better it is for our health and the health of our environment.</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting us, and for getting the word out about Beeco and Sustainability!</p>

<h3><strong>HERE’S WHY WE DID IT, AND HOW IT WORKS: </strong></h3>
<h3><strong><em>The Beeco Team believes that: </em></strong></h3>
<p><em>Small acts can have powerful positive impacts. When people make small changes in their daily habits, it will create a huge benefit to our environment;</em></p>
<p><em>Information is empowerment - as people learn how their individual choices can bring about real environmental improvements, they will be excited, enthusiastic, proud and inspired; </em></p>
<p><em>Our individual acts can collectively overcome the enormous problems facing us, that on our own, seem out of reach and unmanageable;</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone wants to live in a healthy and sustainable world - it’s up to each one of us to make it happen. </em></p>
<p>Beeco provides tools to make those tasks simple, fun … and rewarding!</p>
<h3><em><strong>Did you know...</strong></em></h3>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Americans generate 250 million tons of trash each year!!</em></strong></p>
<p align=""center"">That is nearly 4 ½ lbs by each of us, every day!!</p>

<p>While this may be the statistical state of things, not all the news is bad.</p>
<p>Recycling rates by Americans are on the rise! In 2010, recycling rates increased to 34% of all municipal solid waste. However, most of this increase is for paper and metals recycling and composting.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>As for plastics, only 8% of all plastic disposed of was recycled!</em></strong></p>
<p>And only about 2% of the 100 billion plastic bags we use each year (approx. 500 is used by every adult in the U.S.) gets recycled.  Part of the reason for that is because they are very difficult to process - plastic bags cause significant damage at recycling processing centers, requiring costly additional processing to keep the bags separated from other recyclable material.  And many of the billions of plastic bags that don’t end up being recycled often end up in the landfill either. Instead, polluting our waterways, neighborhoods and parks.  Yet, we use more and more of it every year. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.iaccessmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Overflow-cups-people-walking-by.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.iaccessmarketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pollution_ocean.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We especially need to <em><strong>reduce, reuse and recycle <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">plastics</span></strong></em> because, unlike paper, it <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">doesn’t biodegrade</span> – ever!  It just fills up our landfills and collects in our oceans. When it ends up in lakes and oceans, it photo-degrades into tiny pieces that the fish and other sea life ingest.  And guess what happens when we eat that seafood? </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Would you knowingly choose to eat petroleum?  Ick!<br/></em></strong></p>
<p>Over 330 million barrels of petroleum and natural gas liquids are used to make plastic products in the U.S. each year, nearly 5% of our total petroleum consumption. And 12 million barrels of that is used just to make disposable plastic bags.</p>
<p>We won’t even go deep into the significant adverse health and environmental impacts of paper and Styrofoam products (high levels of methane greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals), we’ve already said enough to inspire action, haven’t we?</p>
<p>Although, our population and consumption and pollution rates continue to increase, we have a huge opportunity to make strides in reducing the volume of food &amp; beverage containers, and plastic bags being trashed. </p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCING The BeecoSmart<sup>TM</sup> Sustainability Rewards Program!</strong></p>
<p><strong>The <em>BeecoSmart<sup>TM</sup> Program</em></strong> is a market-driven ‘Eco-Loyalty’ program that rewards consumers for using reusable products instead of single use, disposable bags, cups, and beverage bottles made from plastic and trees. </p>
<p>As a result of this, businesses are able to reduce their expenses for purchasing single use products and for having less trash!</p>
<p>Businesses also gain more loyal customers who appreciate the company’s commitment to sustainability and for being a good corporate environmental steward.  They also receive metrics on their stores’ user participation and the resulting environmental benefits (e.g. resources saved, waste prevented, etc.)</p>
<p>Gotta love how doing one simple thing can have so many upsides!</p>

<h3><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></h3>
<p>You can sign up to be a Beeco member at your favorite business on one of the <strong><em>BeecoSmart</em></strong> user interface tablets -- or on our website, or mobile app (coming soon), or directly through the stores system.</p>
<p>Then follow our simple three-step process:</p>
<p>1.  Once you are registered using your phone # (or other 10 digit number) or by using a Beeco Key Fob having a unique QR code to scan at a Retailers’ checkout location, you <strong>log your reward activity</strong> each time you bring a reusable bag, mug or container to a participating <strong><em>Beeco Network Retailer</em></strong>. When you make a purchase and use your own bag or cup, you are eligible to earn points at that retailer.</p>
<p>2.  Watch your points accumulate through your online login or mobile app.  Once you earn enough points, they can be redeemed for discounts or merchandise offered through any of the participating <strong><em>Beeco Network Retailers</em></strong> who subscribe to the program.</p>
<p>3.  Choose from the rewards offered by any of the participating Retailers.  Beeco's subscription agreement with Retailers includes the requirement that they offer consumer perks that are more valuable than what is offered to the general public, for example 20% off any purchase if the store already offers a coupon for 10% off; or free coffee drink after 8 purchases if a punch card for 'buy 10 get one free' is already offered. </p>
<p>That’s it!   Simple.</p>
<h3><strong>NOW LET’S GET STARTED!</strong></h3>
<p>Beeco is partnering with the City of Boulder, Colorado to bring the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Sustainability Rewards Program</em></strong> to retailers throughout the City starting this Spring!  And we are in talks with another even larger city to do the same. </p>
<p>This is great, however we need to complete more of our technical development (complete a mobile app for reading stations, and the software solution for existing POS systems at larger retailers that have lots of integrated cash registers), and market it to everyone - as well as keep the lights on.</p>
<p>And we want to make sure these first launches go great, so we can have a successful foundation to bring the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Program</em></strong> to other communities nation-wide!  Increasing awareness about reducing pollution on a large scale of our population is our goal!</p>
<h3><strong>YOUR PART:</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $35,000, which will allow us to complete what is needed for this initial successful launch, and have a solid foundation for subsequent roll outs in other communities.  Any funding we raise above this amount will help us continue to grow the business and implement the sustainability rewards program.  :)</p>
<p>For your support in this effort, we are very excited to offer you several awesome perks:</p>
<p><strong>From</strong> – appreciation and recognition of your support;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>To</strong> – sending you one or more of our high quality, reusable products all of which are made from recycled materials,</p>

<p>It is extremely important (and even more so appreciated) that we have your support in launching this program in our first city.  It is of the highest priority for us that this launch is a success as it lays the foundation of our future growth and proves the viability of the program.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone we have talked to - individuals, business and municipal leaders and retail store managers - are very excited about the potential of <strong><em>BeecoSmart<sup>TM</sup> Sustainability Rewards Program</em></strong> to make real meaningful collective change toward reducing our social environmental impacts.  And we are confident with your help we will exceed their expectations.</p>

<h3><strong>THE BACKSTORY:</strong></h3>
<p>Beeco started after Leslie Weise, a corporate intellectual property attorney and business consultant with a passion and activism for environmental and civil rights, became impatient after years of observing that our nation’s (and world) consumption and pollution rates were continuing to increase, yet our recycling and reuse rates were going in the opposite direction. At about the same time she had her first child, she clearly realized that if each of us doesn’t become part of the solution, then a solution might not happen.  So when her son turned 5 in 2011, she quit her comfy corporate life and decided to strike out on her own in pursuit of finding business friendly solutions that incorporate current social and technological trends that would appeal to more people. </p>
<p>A second child was then born, named Beeco!  Beeco is pronounced ""Bee-co"" but stands for “Be Eco”, and its mission is to create tools that are engaging and simple so that people and businesses want to participate … and get rewarded for doing so!   The goal for Beeco is to appeal to as many demographics of people as possible, and not be exclusive to any person or group who may wish to participate.  By increasing awareness that the solution rests with each one of us, and that collectively our actions can overcome the enormous problems facing us that otherwise seem out of reach - the goal for recycling and reuse to become the norm, and no longer the exception, will be achieved! </p>
<p>As for user engagement, Leslie and her brilliant and dedicated co-Founder Daniel Ziskin, have made sure that the user interfaces are accessible to not only those people with the latest smart phone devices (they may scan QR codes or use wireless for tracking their transactions).  They have also made sure that those without the latest gadgets can still participate; those folks can simply enter a phone or other 10 digit code into an easy to use interface screen at the checkout station.  And finally, they have been cognizant that the tools they create must scale so that people, stores, communities and cities can adopt the program nation-wide!</p>
<p>Beeco is designed to appeal to a wide range of people, from the sustainable and environmental minded who will enjoy the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Program</em></strong> to earn rewards for what the acts they are already taking, to those folks who make consumer savings a priority who will also appreciate the rewards to supplement their good feeling for acts that help the environment.  Beeco's proprietary, patent-pending business process is integrated in this combined software, social media, technology and marketing solution!</p>
<p>As for appeal to Cities and Communities, Beeco works both in conjunction with regulatory approaches to addressing our pollution problem, and also as an alternative to municipalities that prefer a market-based solution over regulatory methods for waste reduction.  A carrot, with or instead of, the stick!</p>
<p>And its appeal is working.  Nearly all business and municipal leaders to whom we have introduced the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Sustainability Rewards Program</em></strong>, as well as people of all consumer types, have been excited to participate in the <strong><em>BeecoSmart Program</em></strong>.  The first two cities whose officials have roles that include waste reduction and sustainability with whom we have discussed the program, have expressed their commitment to actively promote it. </p>
<p>The <strong>Beeco Team</strong> now includes additional Rock Star talent: another Technical IT Director, Darrell Ritchie, and a Business Development Director, Marisa Katz.  We are also blessed to have dedicated, experienced business advisors who have spent tireless efforts helping get Beeco launched over the past year.  And we have had the help of interns from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs Bachelor of Innovations Program, as well as intern/advisor Rebeca Bishop, a talented IT Program Manager from the Columbia University Master of Science Earth Institute Sustainability Management Degree Program.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping our business continue to grow, and most importantly, for supporting the Beeco Mission to reduce pollution and help make our planet healthy for us and the children among us, and for all their children for generations to come!</p>

Beeco is partnering with the City of Boulder, Colorado to bring the BeecoSmart Sustainability Rewards Program to retailers throughout the City starting this Spring!  And we are in talks with another even larger city to do the same. 
This is great, however we need to complete more of our technical development (complete a mobile app for reading stations, and the software solution for existing POS systems at larger retailers that have lots of integrated cash registers), and market it to everyone - as well as keep the lights on.
And we want to make sure these first launches go great, so we can have a successful foundation to bring the BeecoSmart Program to other communities nation-wide!  Increasing awareness about reducing pollution on a large scale of our population is our goal!
YOUR PART:
We are looking to raise $35,000, which will allow us to complete what is needed for this initial successful launch, and have a solid foundation for subsequent roll outs in other communities.  Any funding we raise above this amount will help us continue to grow the business and implement the sustainability rewards program.  :)
For your support in this effort, we are very excited to offer you several awesome perks:
From – appreciation and recognition of your support;
To – sending you one or more of our high quality, reusable products all of which are made from recycled materials,
  
To – appointing you a Beeco Ambassador, Sponsor or Sustainable Partner to promote our BeecoSmartTM Sustainability Rewards Program in yours or other communities!
It is extremely important (and even more so appreciated) that we have your support in launching this program in our first city.  It is of the highest priority for us that this launch is a success as it lays the foundation of our future growth and proves the viability of the program.
Nearly everyone we have talked to - individuals, business and municipal leaders and retail store managers - are very excited about the potential of BeecoSmartTM Sustainability Rewards Program to make real meaningful collective change toward reducing our social environmental impacts.  And we are confident with your help we will exceed their expectations.
Be sure to share this message on all the social sites.  We put some links below. 
Thank you very much!

THE BACKSTORY:
Beeco started after Leslie Weise, a corporate intellectual property attorney and business consultant with a passion and activism for environmental and civil rights, became impatient after years of observing that our nation’s (and world) consumption and pollution rates were continuing to increase, yet our recycling and reuse rates were going in the opposite direction. At about the same time she had her first child, she clearly realized that if each of us doesn’t become part of the solution, then a solution might not happen.  So when her son turned 5 in 2011, she quit her comfy corporate life and decided to strike out on her own in pursuit of finding business friendly solutions that incorporate current social and technological trends that would appeal to more people. 
A second child was then born, named Beeco!  Beeco is pronounced ""Bee-co"" but stands for “Be Eco”, and its mission is to create tools that are engaging and simple so that people and businesses want to participate … and get rewarded for doing so!   The goal for Beeco is to appeal to as many demographics of people as possible, and not be exclusive to any person or group who may wish to participate.  By increasing awareness that the solution rests with each one of us, and that collectively our actions can overcome the enormous problems facing us that otherwise seem out of reach - the goal for recycling and reuse to become the norm, and no longer the exception, will be achieved! 
As for user engagement, Leslie and her brilliant and dedicated co-Founder Daniel Ziskin, have made sure that the user interfaces are accessible to not only those people with the latest smart phone devices (they may scan QR codes or use wireless for tracking their transactions).  They have also made sure that those without the latest gadgets can still participate; those folks can simply enter a phone or other 10 digit code into an easy to use interface screen at the checkout station.  And finally, they have been cognizant that the tools they create must scale so that people, stores, communities and cities can adopt the program nation-wide!
Beeco is designed to appeal to a wide range of people, from the sustainable and environmental minded who will enjoy the BeecoSmart Program to earn rewards for what the acts they are already taking, to those folks who make consumer savings a priority who will also appreciate the rewards to supplement their good feeling for acts that help the environment.  Beeco's proprietary, patent-pending business process is integrated in this combined software, social media, technology and marketing solution!
As for appeal to Cities and Communities, Beeco works both in conjunction with regulatory approaches to addressing our pollution problem, and also as an alternative to municipalities that prefer a market-based solution over regulatory methods for waste reduction.  A carrot, with or instead of, the stick!
And its appeal is working.  Nearly all business and municipal leaders to whom we have introduced the BeecoSmart Sustainability Rewards Program, as well as people of all consumer types, have been excited to participate in the BeecoSmart Program.  The first two cities whose officials have roles that include waste reduction and sustainability with whom we have discussed the program, have expressed their commitment to actively promote it. 
The Beeco Team now includes additional Rock Star talent: another Technical IT Director, Darrell Ritchie, and a Business Development Director, Marisa Katz.  We are also blessed to have dedicated, experienced business advisors who have spent tireless efforts helping get Beeco launched over the past year.  And we have had the help of interns from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs Bachelor of Innovations Program, as well as intern/advisor Rebeca Bishop, a talented IT Program Manager from the Columbia University Master of Science Earth Institute Sustainability Management Degree Program.

Thanks for helping our business continue to grow, and most importantly, for supporting the Beeco Mission to reduce pollution and help make our planet healthy for us and the children among us, and for all their children for generations to come!
Sustainably Yours,

<p><strong>STRATEGY: Phases 0-4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase 0 - The Creation (This Project):</strong> This is the hardest part of any start-up business, the creation and build up of the business itself. This is what this indiegogo project is for...to get us going. The creation phase contains some of the hardest aspect to find and obtain. This includes; funding, initial customers, assets/stock, awareness, finding the right team members, and building the business case/plan. This project will help obtain our most important asset...the cups.</p>
<p>Phase 1 - The First Start: Once we obtain funding via indiegogo and other sources, and get our first customers to agree to this bold idea, our next big step is a leap of faith. Here we actually begin to operate the business and processes. Our goal is to start with a minimal of 1 to 3 establishments in the fall of 2013.</p>
<p>Phase 2 - Expansion: Beginning in the spring 2014 after we proof the concept and processes of the business, we hope to begin expansion into neighboring establishments. The great thing about the system is that it is extremely scalable. To take on more establishments is a matter of purchasing more cups, and obtaining more labor.</p>
<p>Phase 3 - Advancement: This is the point where we can go BIG! Here is the point where we develop advance processes using technology and begin to automate and refine the system. The phase will allow us to advance quickly in the DC area. The phase will require considerable funding to develop the IT infrastructure. This phase is planned in 2016-2017.</p>
<p>Phase 4 - The Push: Here is where we will be prepared to obtain participating establishments in the greater DC area to include all of Northern DC and Maryland. This phase will include creation of several more cleaning facilities in other areas. This phase is long term and will most likely occur in 2018-ish.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 0 indiegogo Funding - What do we need:</strong></p>
<p>We need a minimal of $3000 to begin with one establishment. This is bare bones. The idea amount is $30k, but we could start comfortably with $10k</p>
<p>$3000 funding will allow a start with 1 establishment and:</p>
<p>      ·$1200 - 300 laser engraved stainless steel cups</p>
<p>      ·$100 - Laser engraving set-up fee</p>
<p>      ·$400 – Business registration</p>
<p>      ·$500 – One month business liability insurance</p>
<p>      ·$300 – One month share kitchen fee</p>
<p>$10,000 funding will allow a start with 2 to 3 establishments and:</p>
<p>      ·$3600 – 900 laser engraved stainless steel cups</p>
<p>      ·$100 - Laser engraving set-up fee</p>
<p>      ·$400 – Business registration</p>
<p>      ·$1500 – 3 month business liability insurance</p>
<p>      ·$900 – 3 month share kitchen fee</p>
<p>      ·$1300 – Initial marketing campaign (includes website and branding)</p>
<p>      ·$500 – Initial lawyer consultation</p>
<p>      ·$900 – LLC filing fee</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>
<p>Q. Will these cups be used for both hot and cold beverages?</p>
<p>    A. Yes. The single wall cup is made for cold beverages. Hot beverages will require the use of a sleeve.</p>
<p>Q. Does the cup transfer a metallic flavor to the beverage?</p>
<p>    A. No. Unlike other metals, stainless steel is not known for this, but just to make sure the interior is electro-polished to eliminate any transfer of a metal taste to the beverage or beverage taste to the metal.</p>
<p>Q. Can I use any type of lid on these cups?</p>
<p>    A. Yes. These cups are make to exact industry cup standard. All style of standard lids will fit. This includes coffee lids, soda lids, and frappuccino lids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
<p>- Users and Customers fail to accepts or reject the system. Solution to this is a highly effective marketing campaign and creating a culture around the concept. Customer and user surveys will continuously be used.</p>
<p>- The business model fails to produce sustainable revenue. Solution is great metrics and a stellar operations to ensure maximum efficiencies and constant adjustment of costs and charges to continuously maintain an increase in revenue. An outstanding COO will be essential here.</p>
<p>- Big name competition enters the market. Solution is to work aggressively to pre-position ourselves to meet this challenge. This includes rapid expansion, marketing, follow-ship, culture, sponsorship and funding. When the competition enters, we must be ready to out compete them to maintain a large share of the market in DC.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>- The stainless steel cups fail to meet the expectations that they are durable and can sustain multiple use cycles. Solution will to be monitor the cup endurance early and assess the situation. If needed then alternate cups will be researched and purchased to replace the stainless steel cups.</p>
<p>- The cleaning process fails to meet expectations causing the customer and user to reject the reuse cups, especially over the course of time. Solution is to monitor and assess the cleaning process early and identify problem areas and work rapidly to remedy the situation. The stainless steel cups were chosen because of their great clean-ability and durability.</p>

<p>My name is Christopher (Krzysztof in Polish) and I am putting together this campaign to help an inventor in Niagara Falls, called Bruce McBurney,  to get enough funding for him to create a prototype of a 100 mpg carburetor.</p>
<p>I have known Bruce for over two years and in the past few months I have been helping him with his website and in converting his book into an ebook (Kindle and epub) format.</p>
<p>I have read the book that Bruce wrote - The Super High Mileage Report - and was impressed with how clear it was in describing why the various high mileage vehicles that have been created in the last 80 years were getting such outrageously high miles per gallon compared to what vehicles get these days. He also writes about others who claim to get  5 times the regular mileage.</p>
<p>Bruce's information when converted into a working prototype will save the consumer thousands of dollars and will take away money from the oil interests and the government (due to the high percentage of revenue from every gallon/liter that goes to the government in the form of taxes).</p>
<p>Anyone can take Bruce's book, read it, understand that this is possible but very few could then make their own super high mileage carburetor fuel system too. It is fairly complex as history has proven and it would take a fair bit of investment hence this campaign to raise the monies to build one to demonstrate the feasibility and get this information out to the world.</p>
<p>To help Bruce achieve this goal various bonuses are provided for different levels of contributions. The main one is the Compensator which is a kit that costs $150 (+ shipping) for either regular or V8 size. If we can get over 230 of these units sold then we would have met our target. It is understandable though the some people may not have the monies to give. Which is why the other bonuses are provided. Hopefully there is something for everyone's budget.</p>
<p>The biggest benefit for getting the Compensator is its ability to cut down up to 75% of the emissions coming out of the tailpipe. The mileage gains are up to 25 % depending on engine and wear factors.</p>
<p>Another benefit of this campaign is making people aware of the fact that cutting emissions is actually very simple. The reason that this invention has not been taken up by the various car manufacturers is that the automotive industry makes money on engine tune ups and repairs which the Compensator cuts down on substantially.</p>
<p>We hope that you will contribute in some way and we would also like you to pass this campaign on to your family members and friends. The more people that know about this the better for everyone, the environment and the world.</p>

We have a combined 60+ years in this computer database system area. After sharing similar stories and concerns over the impact of fossil fuels in our environment, we found that we had mutual concerns. Realizing that we had this commonality we decided to begin a partnership that would have a positive impact on our environment, and future, hence was born Logos Selecta INC, now called Solar and Wind Solutions LLC, (this name is more descriptive as to what we do).</font><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">We have been working together for the last 5 years and in that time, with a staff of engineers, system designers, and marketing specialist, have consulted on projects from the very small (Self sustaining golf carts that run completely from solar power and never stops), to large scale solar projects that are estimated to be able to put out multi-megawatt capacities, enough to run small communities. In our experience we feel that this process is a little slow. After much consideration we determined that it would be best to do a large scale project that would have an immediate impact on our community's health and well being, by developing a large scale solar project as quickly as possible in order to lessen polluting fuels in our environment.</font><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><br/></font></p>

A 25MW system that will supply 30,000 homes in Arizona for 25 years or more without any degradation to the planet's environment and with zero health issues related to burning carbon based fossil fuels.
How?
At this time we are raising funds to purchase and/or lease land in Arizona to develop our solar farm. We are seeking $850,000 in order to accomplish the 1st stages of our project. With this amount we can create a platform for a 25MW system, ultimately we plan to expand this project to a 100MW sized project.
Initial costs will be related to planning and architecture, civil engineer, labor, and negotiations between the local municipalities, utilities and our project. 
By creating this smaller project we would be able to support and sustain expansion costs via the buyback of our clean and renewable energy source to local municipalities and utilities for a fraction of the cost. Thereby these municipalities and utilities won't have to use as many counterproductive carbon based fossil fuels in our environment.

Why?

The successful completion of this project will mean cleaner air and less fossil fuel usage for an overall greener and cleaner planet. Your contribution to this project will be the first step in making this happen. 
Help us in our goal to: 



Stop global warming.
Stop using all pollution causing fuels (oil, coal, gas and nuclear).
Start to give our future generations, our kids and grand-kids, a chance to breath clean air.

Start using renewable energy like solar and wind which will be available and renewable for many, many, millennia and will never be a problem for nature or mankind.  


We need to act now, together, to ensure that inaction does not triumph over positive action to move towards renewable energy and end human-induced climate change. As Secretary of State John Kerry says, """"Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire,"" he said. ""Once again, the science grows clearer, the case grows more compelling, and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate.""
Our Dream...
After the expansion we plan to start solar projects in Haiti and other developing countries that bring FREE electricity to schools, hospitals and homes. Our dream and vision is that the whole world uses renewable energy which will make our environment and world a lot better, safer, and cleaner. Energy should NOT be a luxury of the rich countries. The sun, wind and waves belongs to everybody on this planet. 
Who are we?
Solar and Wind Solutions LLC provides alternative energy solutions and planning services for residences and corporate entities throughout North America, South America, and Canada. Visit us at www.800solarwind.com
Mr. Kallin and Mr. Smith, Co-Founders; 
Before founding Logos Selecta INC, and, Solar and Wind Solutions LLC, Mr.Kallin and Mr. Smith worked in the technical data field, (Mainframe, and web based Computer systems, in the financial sector). We have a combined 60+ years in this computer database system area. After sharing similar stories and concerns over the impact of fossil fuels in our environment, we found that we had mutual concerns. Realizing that we had this commonality we decided to begin a partnership that would have a positive impact on our environment, and future, hence was born Logos Selecta INC, now called Solar and Wind Solutions LLC, (this name is more descriptive as to what we do).
We have been working together for the last 5 years and in that time, with a staff of engineers, system designers, and marketing specialist, have consulted on projects from the very small (Self sustaining golf carts that run completely from solar power and never stops), to large scale solar projects that are estimated to be able to put out multi-megawatt capacities, enough to run small communities. In our experience we feel that this process is a little slow. After much consideration we determined that it would be best to do a large scale project that would have an immediate impact on our community's health and well being, by developing a large scale solar project as quickly as possible in order to lessen polluting fuels in our environment.
In order to accomplish this goal we would appreciate your help. Not only will you receive a wonderful gift for your efforts and contributions but also you'll receive the gift of a longer and healthier life for generations to come. 
Thank You

<h3>Why $2,600</h3>
<p>Here is where the money will go:</p>
<p>*$700 airfare NYC-Quito </p>
<p>*$350 car from home to airport, from airport to hotel, from hotel to La Hesperia (roundtrip)</p>
<p>*$300 hotel two nights. The volunteer orientation occurs in Quito on only Mondays &amp; Wednesdays, to show up on time I'll need to arrive the night before. To leave, I may need to stay over in Quito again to catch my flight on time.</p>
<p>*$300 fee to volunteer for 2 weeks at La Hesperia, including the application fee</p>

<p>*$200 meals, toiletries, tips</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, that portion I do receive will go toward the trip at a later date.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>*$25--I'll send you a postcard from Ecuador!</p>
<p>*$100--I'll plant a tree for you, and put together a miniature photo album of your tree, its genus &amp; species, and its location on a map</p>
<p>*$2,000--if you're in NYC, Boston, DC or Baltimore, I'll do a design plan of your garden based on a municipal site survey. I'll do the design after the trip to Ecuador, and include things I learned on that trip in your garden design!</p>

<h3>Making better gardens</h3>
<p>When gardens are designed with beauty, the community, and the environment in mind, they are truly good gardens. First-hand understanding of ecosystems helps a garden designer identify and respond to their own environment more effectively and responsibly.</p>

<p><strong><span>Help these incredible animals, and receive a TAX RECEIPT!!</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The waters of the Pacific Northwest are home to a wide variety of majestic marine mammal species. Among these are the iconic Killer whales (or Orcas) that people travel from around the globe to have a chance to glimpse in their natural environment. Killer whales are highly intelligent, extremely social and undeniably charismatic but unfortunately they are also still very much at risk. There are fewer than 90 individual killer whales left in the Southern resident population (frequently seen around Victoria and Northern Washington).   </span></p>
<p><img alt=""Resident Killer Whales in BC"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cetussociety.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/PICT0406.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Although once feared and grossly misunderstood, killer whales began to capture our hearts during the 1970’s when they began to show up in marine parks around the world. Unfortunately there are still many killer whales facing life in captivity but there has been a definite shift in public perception of these living conditions and many people now opt to seek out experiences with these animals in the wild.</p>
<p><span>We are blessed to have a chance to see these incredible beings in their natural environment but with increased shipping traffic and underwater noise, decreased salmon stocks and concerns around accumulated toxins, their natural environment is becoming increasingly challenging for them to live in. </span></p>
<p><span><img alt=""Spy Hop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cetussociety.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sept-3-misty-spyhop-1024x685.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span>If we want to protect this beautiful, iconic yet fragile species it’s imperative that we do all we can to decrease current pressures that these animals are facing. We do not want to have to explain to our grandchildren that this incredible, intelligent black and white whale that used to exist off our coast is no longer there because our generation didn’t care enough to protect them. </span></p>
<p><strong>Who We are</strong></p>
<p>Cetus is a non-profit, charitable society based in Victoria BC. Since 2005 we have been working to facilitate the conservation of the marine environment through a variety of programs. One of our main programs is called Straitwatch and is an on-the-water monitoring and education program which helps to minimize disturbances to killer whales and other marine mammals.</p>
<p>Southern resident (fish-eating) killer whales are listed as endangered under the Canada Species at Risk Act (SARA) with fewer than 90 animals in the entire population. Research has demonstrated that killer whales show avoidance behaviour in the presence of vessels, and that whale responses to vessel presence and/or sound may include ceasing of feeding, resting and social interaction. Because of these impacts, federal guidelines have been developed to minimize disturbances while still allowing boaters to view these majestic animals in their natural environment.  The Straitwatch program helps to ensure that these guidelines are understood and adhered to.  </p>
<p>For the past ten years the Straitwatch program has received a significant portion of its funding from Environment Canada’s Habitat Stewardship Program. This year our federal government funding was not approved. As a result we were forced to take our vessels off the water for all of August and September. This is the busiest time of year for both boats and whales and since our boats have been tied up we have received reports almost daily of concerning incidents happening around the whales. These reports only help to reinforce the need for our program!</p>
<p><img alt=""Cetus Educating Private Boaters"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/643865_10151010544321841_525329749_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cetus Educating Private Boaters Photo by Jackie Hildering http://themarinedetective.com/""/></p>
<p>Without the government funding that we have relied heavily on since our inception, we are concerned about our ability to move forward as a society and to continue to provide this vital monitoring and education in future years. This is where you can help to make a huge difference in the lives of these killer whales!</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>Cetus is an incredibly efficient organization run by a team of unbelievably dedicated and passionate board members, staff, interns and volunteers.</p>
<p> - If we are able to raise $300 000 we are confident that we can provide   another full season of monitoring and education both in the waters around Victoria and in the waters around Northern Vancouver Island which are home to the threatened population of Northern Resident killer whales.</p>
<p>- If we are able to raise even a portion of this amount, we will use this money to keep our organization going, to continue our community outreach programs and to provide at least partial monitoring throughout the summer.</p>
<p>- The 300,000 goes towards fuel, moorage and essentail maintenace for our vessles, as well as 8 full time (some seasonal) employees (in 2 different locations) to be out there providing the education and looking out for the whales best interests. </p>
<p>Your generous donation to our cause will help minimize potential disturbances around our iconic killer whales and other marine life, increase public awareness of these animals and the threats they face and promote respect and understanding of the marine environment. You can also receive some exciting perks by donating to us. These include a beautiful art card, Cetus Society cozy toques, and even a day on our monitoring vessel!

<h1>Who are we?</h1>We are middle school students at Lesher International Baccalaureate (IB) World Middle School in Fort Collins, Colorado.  We applied for and were accepted into an Extended Learning Opportunity focused on sustainability.  One of the many treats we experience as a part of the service learning class is a trip to Catalina Environmental Leadership Program (CELP) in California from November 7-12, 2014. Part of being an IB student is striving to be knowledgeable, open-minded, inquirers, principled, balanced, reflective, and caring.  We hope to practice all of these characteristics while running this campaign and on Catalina Island.<br/><br/><h1>What we're doing?</h1>
<p>This unique, high-energy learning experience gives us what we cannot find in a classroom: a chance to study natural ecosystems and sustainable living firsthand and hands on. We learn about sustainable living practices such as composting, recycling, and organic gardening, discovering how nature provides perfect examples of communities functioning in a self-sustaining way.  There are 25 students going on the trip along with 3 teachers from our school.  9 of us are participating in this campaign.  </p>
<p>Part of the learning experience will be creating, managing, and fulfilling the perks we offer here.   Running a campaign like this as middle school students (with some help from adults) will be so valuable as we learn to become project managers and will help us throughout our lives.   Learning to be grateful for your help, and sharing what we have learned with you and others is equally important.  Last but not least, we want to pay it forward by teaching others small things that make a huge impact on the planet!</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?We are middle school students at Lesher International Baccalaureate (IB) World Middle School in Fort Collins, Colorado.  We applied for and were accepted into an Extended Learning Opportunity focused on sustainability.  One of the many treats we experience as a part of the service learning class is a trip to Catalina Environmental Leadership Program (CELP) in California from November 7-12, 2014. Part of being an IB student is striving to be knowledgeable, open-minded, inquirers, principled, balanced, reflective, and caring.  We hope to practice all of these characteristics while running this campaign and on Catalina Island.What we're doing?
This unique, high-energy learning experience gives us what we cannot find in a classroom: a chance to study natural ecosystems and sustainable living firsthand and hands on. We learn about sustainable living practices such as composting, recycling, and organic gardening, discovering how nature provides perfect examples of communities functioning in a self-sustaining way.  There are 25 students going on the trip along with 3 teachers from our school.  9 of us are participating in this campaign.  
Part of the learning experience will be creating, managing, and fulfilling the perks we offer here.   Running a campaign like this as middle school students (with some help from adults) will be so valuable as we learn to become project managers and will help us throughout our lives.   Learning to be grateful for your help, and sharing what we have learned with you and others is equally important.  Last but not least, we want to pay it forward by teaching others small things that make a huge impact on the planet!
  What We Need & What You Get 

The hard costs for each student are $746.  All of our money for the trip is due by the end of October.  We are running a very short 15-day campaign so please donate today.  



airfare $280


ground transportation $80


ferry $60


camp fees  $276


+misc. spending money for food and activities $50 


Our goal is to raise $350 per student participating or $3150. Our stretch goal is $6714, and of course we're gonna GO FOR IT, but we wanted to set an achievable goal. 


Depending on your level of support, supporters will...
Have their names printed on the back of our t-shirts.  This is a great way to honor your child and give a small donation in their name or challenge your fellow students from high school or college to make a donation. It's only $10! OR
Receive a hand-written postcard from Catalina Island sharing what we have learned, OR
Receive a special thank you photo of our group at Catalina Island matted and signed by all the students.   Great for individuals or small businesses! OR
Attend a reception where we share what we have learned and describe our plan to pay it forward. OR
Receive a Elementary Education Session.  A short presentation reviewing 3 simple ways to live a more sustainable life appropriate for kids ages 5-11.  You may choose the group receiving the session (girl scouts, church group, after school club) or we will coordinate for you.  We already have a list of classrooms ready for us! This is a great way to share our knowledge and encourage & inspire younger kids to make smart sustainable choices. OR
Have a  tree planted on the Lesher Middle School campus with a plaque honoring your name or business name.



If we don't reach our goal, the money we DO raise will go towards the trip and we will brainstorm for new fundraising ideas.
If we exceed our stretch goal, we will help supplement costs for other students or teachers or will contribute to a fund to establish scholarships for next year.
If you have  a specific student that you would like to help, you may do that by putting the student's name in the ""2nd address"" section.  And, of course, you can donate to the shared fund as well.  
We also have a goal of 25 campaign shares in the first week.  Please help us make that happen by using the share features within this campaign.

So What are Our Risks?




This campaign is different.  
It is NOT just about the money. 
Its about the process of creating the campaign, working as a team, cherishing the opportunity to build leadership skills, and sharing how grateful we are for your support in a meaningful way. 
 We are learning to ask for help which is harder than we thought.  Its hard to put ourselves out there and take this risk. 



What if we fail?    What if people don't see this as a valuable cause? 

 If we don't raise the money needed we will have to put our brains together and problem solve.  
In some ways, that wouldn't be a failure, there would be learning there too!  



  Other Ways You Can Help We know that some of you reading this know us and know the program, and some of you are learning about us for the first time.  We would love and appreciate your financial support.  However, your willingness to share our story with those around you is just as meaningful in some ways.   Please help us the share tool from this campaign",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

I will be keeping a hive at 55. I have become better at time management & allowing more time for my hobbies. I have matured as a lady & this bee keeping journey no longer seems too tough to handle. I'm channeling my inner queen Bey.I wish to raise bees primarily to do my part to save them & help prevent their decline. In a few years, if my hive(s) thrive I would love to be able to harvest honey but that is not my main goal. Although i do love honey for it's nutritional benefits, health benefits, & longevity, bee's honey belongs to them. Bees spend their lives working & making that liquid gold. It would be a bit evil to just steal it. Imagine if you worked your wings off every day & everything you made, in return, went to the hypothetical (wo)man! These bees & I are going to coexist peacefully & hopefully with a mutual respect.The $500 dollars is a rough estimate of what it will take to set up a functional hive this spring. Here is a quick breakdown:*10 frame bee hive starter kit- around $280 *protective clothing & tools- around $150****there is also the option, instead of the above, for an ""ultimate hive starter kit"" which includes the hive starter & the clothing/tools for $489Then comes the most important part, the bees! Starter bees from either a nuc or 3 lbs of bees- $150Any funds raised that exceed the limit will go towards student loans. Just kidding, they'll go towards extra bee supplies :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

is home to heroes and goddesses, mythical creatures and jeweled beaches, damn

<p> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Evading Oversight. </h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">The biohackers insist they are totally within their rights to spread bio-engineered seeds from coast to coast. They claim that the US Department of Agriculture has advised them they can avoid regulatory oversight if they used a particular genetic engineering technique called the gene gun. This allows them to<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/07/business/energy-environment/cries-of-lax-regulation-after-usda-ruling-on-bluegrass.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exploit a controversial loophole in the law</a>carved out by big biotech firms. After all the official pieties about establishing proper oversight of synthetic biology and not rushing ahead with environmental release, the US government appears ready to avert its eyes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The Glowing plant project think they can avoid all regulation and caution by crowdfunding their project on Kickstarter. They didn’t count on us kicking back.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""> </p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Kickstarter's Role</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Incredibly, Kickstarter turns out to be the only entity to have subjected this novel Syn Bio pollution project to any kind of review. Kickstarter has its<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/help/guidelines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">own ethical guidelines</a> that are so specific they exclude the posting of projects involving 'sunglasses' or 'bath products,' yet promoting the world’s first uncontrolled, unmonitored and unregulated release of synthetic organisms apparently didn’t raise any red flags at Kickstarter HQ.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We wrote to Kickstarter at length to ask them to de-list the Glowing Plants project . They sent us a dismissive one line reply. We even submitted this crowdfunding campaign to them - they declined it. We have now launched a petition asking them to not allow engineered organisms to be released through their platform. So far they refuse to discuss their support for the project. Kickstarter continues to host the Glowing Plants project and on 7th June will give over 400,000 in funding over to the Glowing plants guys, implicitly blessing the project. <span>Kickstarter was built to help struggling artists, not give corporate biohackers with risky technologies a blank cheque to threaten our ecosystems. We encourage Kickstarter to its roots and disassociate itself from this project.</span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<h3><span><span>Kicking back!</span></span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://www.etcgroup.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>ETC Group</span></a><span>is a tiny (eight </span><span>person</span><span>) non-profit international civil society research group.

<p dir=""ltr""> We decided if the biohackers can hijack a Kickstarter campaign to release their glowtesque synthetic biology plants and crowdfund for it, then maybe there are quite a few sensible folks who would be willing to pitch in to fund the counter-campaign to stuff the genetically engineered genie back in the bottle – or at least ensure it never makes it out of the glowing plant lab.

<p>As the 'glowing plants' story unfolds, we will be doing everything we can to change the plot.

<p><span> </span></p></div>","There’s a new biotech threat coming from Silicon Valley: a private biotech company has hijacked that other crowd funding platform Kickstarter.com in a plan to release hundreds of thousands of glowing synthetic organisms made with an extreme genetic engineering technology called Synthetic Biology.
Having racked up over $400,000 on their crowdfunding drive the perpetrators of this proposed genetic pollution intend to pull off the first ever intentional release of syntehtic biology-derived organism without any oversight, monitoring or regulation. This would set a terrible and dangerous precedent.
To kick back we are doing a little crowdfunding jujitsu. ETC Group has launched the Kickstopper campaign. To start we have launched a petition and now need to raise the money for a long term campaign to stop the biohackers in their tracks. And as part of it we are going to make a comic book - and a bit of history too.
Join us in saving the word from Synthetic biology pollution. Become a backer of the Kickstopper campaign.
 
 A Novel Biotech Threat:
 It sounds crazy but it's not fiction: three grinning biohackers from a private biotech company associated with Silicon Valley's ultra-libertarian 'Singularity University’ recently landed on Kickstarter's 'most popular' list by promising to spread synthetic organisms across the USA; specifically, to mail packets of bio-engineered seeds to whoever paid them forty bucks online. The seeds, which they said would likely grow into 'glowing plants' (after all, ‘biology is complicated,’ admit the masterminds) would be the viable and reproducing products of a controversial new technology called ‘Synthetic Biology’ – a field that aims to build artificial life-forms from scratch. A field that has never had a deliberate release into the environment before. 

TheNew York Times portrait of the 'Glowing Plants' biohackers
 
Syn What?
 Synthetic Biology (or 'syn bio') can best be described as 'extreme genetic engineering'. it involves designing new strands of DNA moilecules  on a computer and then printing artificial DNA and engineering it into living things  to hijack the workings of a natural organism.  Syn Bio goes beyond the already considerable concerns people have about 'transgenic' genetic engineering and raises further hard-to-assess ecological risks, significant bio-weapons potential and, in the hands of industry, threats to the livelihoods of some of the world’s poorest farmers. Billions of dollars from oil, pharma, chemical and agribusiness firms are flowing into the field portending a new round of corporate power grabs on the stuff of life.

Read the ETC Group’sfull report on Synthetic Biology
 
Risks. Even as the ‘glowing plants’ Kickstarter campaign launched, ethicists from Oxford University released a report that branded Syn Bio one of the biggest 'existential risks'to the human species. It is just the latest in a parade of pronouncements from expert groups  – including from thePresident’s Bioethics Commission, government reps at theUN Biodiversity Convention, anEU expert group, the insurance industry and many others. The current consensus is that no synthetic organisms should be released into the environment without 'precaution,' 'prudent vigilance,' regulation, monitoring and other sober and sensible safeguards - A consensus that the 'glowing plant' biohackers are willfully ignoring. 
 
Growing Concern
While hundreds of thousands of Americans are taking part in a popular movement to stop – or at the very least, label – the first generation of biotech seeds and plants,111 organizations from around the world have called for a moratorium on this next generation of biotech organisms.

Read theThe Principles for the Oversight of Synthetic Biology issued by a coalition of 111 organizations
 
Evading Oversight. 
The biohackers insist they are totally within their rights to spread bio-engineered seeds from coast to coast. They claim that the US Department of Agriculture has advised them they can avoid regulatory oversight if they used a particular genetic engineering technique called the gene gun. This allows them toexploit a controversial loophole in the lawcarved out by big biotech firms. After all the official pieties about establishing proper oversight of synthetic biology and not rushing ahead with environmental release, the US government appears ready to avert its eyes.
The Glowing plant project think they can avoid all regulation and caution by crowdfunding their project on Kickstarter. They didn’t count on us kicking back.
 
Kickstarter's Role
Incredibly, Kickstarter turns out to be the only entity to have subjected this novel Syn Bio pollution project to any kind of review. Kickstarter has itsown ethical guidelines that are so specific they exclude the posting of projects involving 'sunglasses' or 'bath products,' yet promoting the world’s first uncontrolled, unmonitored and unregulated release of synthetic organisms apparently didn’t raise any red flags at Kickstarter HQ.
We wrote to Kickstarter at length to ask them to de-list the Glowing Plants project . They sent us a dismissive one line reply. We even submitted this crowdfunding campaign to them - they declined it. We have now launched a petition asking them to not allow engineered organisms to be released through their platform. So far they refuse to discuss their support for the project. Kickstarter continues to host the Glowing Plants project and on 7th June will give over 400,000 in funding over to the Glowing plants guys, implicitly blessing the project. Kickstarter was built to help struggling artists, not give corporate biohackers with risky technologies a blank cheque to threaten our ecosystems. We encourage Kickstarter to its roots and disassociate itself from this project.
 
Kicking back!
ETC Groupis a tiny (eight person) non-profit international civil society research group. We don't have the financial resources or rich backers that Genome Compiler Corp. has, but we do have a good track record in stopping destructive biotech projects. 
 We decided if the biohackers can hijack a Kickstarter campaign to release their glowtesque synthetic biology plants and crowdfund for it, then maybe there are quite a few sensible folks who would be willing to pitch in to fund the counter-campaign to stuff the genetically engineered genie back in the bottle – or at least ensure it never makes it out of the glowing plant lab. So was born the idea of the counter-Kickstarter Project –the Kickstopper. Roll the crowdfunding wars.
As the 'glowing plants' story unfolds, we will be doing everything we can to change the plot. With your help we will mount asuccesful campaign to stop the syn bio seeds We will work to write a happy ending where no Syn Bio seeds leave the lab, where governments see sense and decide to step in. To write that real story, we will work with artists, scientists, gardeners, farmers, activists, lawyers, students, teachers, government officials, UN delegates, journalists and a growing coalition of civil society groups.
We will also  publish a historic comic book about exactly how we stopped them - and we can send that to you as a backer of this campaign The comic book will include the work of  a talented collection of radical graphic artists, includingShtig,Jordan Worley,Zeph Fishlyn,David Nishizaki,Mensen, Ethan Heitner, in addition to other artists associated withWorld War 3 Illustrated and theBeehive Design Collective.
By backing this Kickstopper campaign, you will not only fund the book, but will also be part of stopping the Syn Bio pollution itself – helping write (and draw) a little bit of history while protecting the future.

Risks and challenges

The biggest risk is that we do nothing and let the synthetic biologists move ahead with releasing hundreds of thousands of syn bio seeds, setting an eerily glowing precedent that many other commercial biotech firms and informal biohackers alike will follow. If that happens, our story won’t have a happy ending.
 
The biggest challenge will be the organized money and power behind the synthetic biologists pushing their twisted storyline. Literally, billions of dollars are flowing into synthetic biology from companies such as Monsanto, BP, Shell, Cargill, DuPont, Dow, Total and Chevron. The Glowing Plants biohackers are associated with a commercial company, Genome Compiler Corporation, and some of their backers have deep pockets to fund a PR war. Indeed they have hired a professional PR company to run their Kickstarter campaign.
 
Indeed, the Glowing Plants Project itself is a PR salvo, as explained by financial guy Antony Evans: ""The main goal of our project is to inspire people and awaken them to the potentials of this technology…Kickstarter is a great way of getting publicity around the capabilities of this technology."" The ability of these commercial players to change and control the ending of the story should not be underestimated.
 
Thankfully, ETC Group has a good track record – in the past we have helped achieve international moratoriums on Terminator seeds (genetically engineered to be sterile) and on geoengineering techniques (attempts to modify planetary systems to hack the climate), including ocean fertilization. We have been around a long time and have lots of good friends to call on – you'll meet them in the pages of the book. They also passionately want to see a good ending to the story.

<p>People for Parks is a Los Angeles based 501 c3  non-profit organization working
towards the day when every child in Los Angeles lives within walking distance
of a safe park.  We do this by finding creative solutions to the problem
of park-scarcity, adding new park space in dense, under-resourced neighborhoods
and  implementing intervention programs to make existing parks safer.
Please visit our website! <span><a href=""http://www.peopleforparks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.peopleforparks.org</a></span></p>
<p><b>The Need</b>: Los Angeles is one of the most under-parked cities in the US, with
only 33% of kids living near a park (97% of kids in Boston live within ¼ mile
of a park; in New York City, 91% do and in San Diego that number is 60%). 
Park scarcity is even more severe in lower-income neighborhoods of our
city.  Hollywood’s population of 85,489 people, for example, lives in a
3.51 square mile area.  This means 0.09 acres of park space for every
1,000 residents.  The national averages range from 6.25 to 10.5 acres per
1000 residents. LA averages 4.2.  Without opportunities for safe, outdoor
recreation, children in high crime, over-populated areas of LA face the danger
of playing in the streets during summer and weekends, when traditional
after-school programming is unavailable.  The alternative is staying
 at home and facing the health and wellness risks associated with limited
physical activity. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>The Opportunity – Community School Parks:</b></p>
<p>Of LAUSD’s 550 elementary and middle
schools, 400 are located within communities in urgent need of a park. Most of these schools contain play spaces that go unused on weekends and
holidays. This is where Community School Parks or CSPs come in. CSPs are active school-site playgrounds that are open to the community
during non-school hours. The Community School Park is based on the
principle that public schoolyards can function as shared recreational
facilities that both reinforce children’s health and fitness and strengthen
entire communities.   Given that schools are evenly spaced and located
within walking distance of most youth in LA, CSPs are also an efficient and
cost effective way to give kids in dense regions of our city the space
they need to play, grow and learn.  </p>
<p>We’ve worked very closely with city and county
officials and with LAUSD – the second largest landowner in Los Angles - to
replace asphalt-covered blacktops and empty sport fields with state-of-the-art
play spaces on public school grounds. LAUSD after-school enrichment staff
members regularly maintain these parks’ safety and supervision according to
district guidelines.   So far, we’ve developed two beautiful Community
School Parks: one at Trinity Elementary School in South LA and another at Vine
Elementary School in Hollywood. As you can see in the video above and in
parents' stories below, both parks have become major hubs for recreation,
celebration and community-building. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Some of our communities' recent testimonials...</b></p>
<p>“I love this park because I can run free.” - Zia W., 4 years old</p>
<p>“We come here every Saturday to shoot hoops and talk about the game.”
- Joshua M., 5th grade</p>
<p>“I get really sad when the park is closed.  My favorite thing
to do here is arts and crafts” - Gisele S., 3rd Grade</p>
<p>“This is the only park we have in this neighborhood.  Everything
else is driving distance, and I don’t have a car (…) When the park first
opened, my daughter was really shy.  She never wanted to leave my
side.  Now that she’s had the opportunity to play and do arts and crafts
with the other kids, she’s really come out of her shell.” -  Teresa S.,
parent</p>
<p>“The parents have come to enjoy it as much as the kids do.  One of
our moms teaches sewing right here at the picnic tables.  A dad started a
tradition of teaching the kids about recycling. Another mom hosted a Filipino
culture day.” - Maria M., parent</p>
<p>“This is the only park that’s in walking distance from us.  Coming
to this park on the weekends is like going to a friend’s backyard to sit and
talk.  The kids love it and it’s a nice decompression time for the parents
(…)The staff members lovingly assist our kids with crafts, sports and
other physical fitness games. (…) I feel like I can really let my guard down at
this park because it’s removed from the street.  It takes the stress off
me.” -  Jessica W., parent</p>
<p>“If we don’t bring them to the park, the kids just watch TV or play
video games at home. Our place is really small. If I don’t bring her to the
park, she bounces off the walls.” -  Maritza R., parent</p>
<p><b>Our Campaign: Fund Community School Parks!</b></p>
<p>Over the last two years, our Community School Parks thrived, but since
the beginning of 2015, due to recent funding cuts, we have not been able to
reopen these parks.</p>
<p><a href=""http://beverlypress.com/2014/12/vine-street-elementary-park-partnership-in-peril/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://beverlypress.com/2014/12/vine-street-elementary-park-partnership-in-peril/</a></p>
<p>We are coming to you to help us reopen our Community School Parks at
Trinity and Vine Elementary Schools.  The process is inexpensive and
easy.  It costs just about $6000 dollars to keep one school park
open every Saturday for one year.  This means $12,000 to open both parks
one day a week (which is our goal for this campaign) and $24,000 to keep both
parks open all weekend (which is our long-term goal).  These funds pay
for a LAUSD youth specialist or district-approved parent
representative to open and close the gates and keep the site supervised. This
dollar amount also pays for supplies and custodial time.<br/>
 </p>
<p>If we raise over $12,000, we’ll extend hours, so that these parks stay
open as much as possible.  If we make it to $60,000, we can keep both
parks open on the weekends and after school every day all year!</p>
<p>If this campaign is really successful, all donations over $60k will go
towards funding our Community School Park Incubator.  What is this? Based
on the success of our two pilot sites, our organization is now launching the
Community School Park Incubator Program wherein we train principals, parents
and other community members on Community School Park development, safety and
maintenance as well as district policy and civic engagement.  We want
children, youth, families and their neighbors to have the skills and resources
needed to transform their school sites into sustainable neighborhood parks of
their own.</p>
<p>Your tax-deductible donations will not only reopen parks in two communities that
desperately need them.  It will also show that through grassroots support,
anyone can fund a project like this in their community, regardless of their zip
code.  That is, if people are provided the right resources, are
organized and receive a helping hand by people like YOU, they can come
together to reinvigorate public school yards.  </p>

- Joshua M., 5th grade
“I get really sad when the park is closed.  My favorite thing
to do here is arts and crafts” - Gisele S., 3rd Grade
“This is the only park we have in this neighborhood.  Everything
else is driving distance, and I don’t have a car (…) When the park first
opened, my daughter was really shy.  She never wanted to leave my
side.  Now that she’s had the opportunity to play and do arts and crafts
with the other kids, she’s really come out of her shell.” -  Teresa S.,
parent
“The parents have come to enjoy it as much as the kids do.  One of
our moms teaches sewing right here at the picnic tables.  A dad started a
tradition of teaching the kids about recycling. Another mom hosted a Filipino
culture day.” - Maria M., parent
“This is the only park that’s in walking distance from us.  Coming
to this park on the weekends is like going to a friend’s backyard to sit and
talk.  The kids love it and it’s a nice decompression time for the parents
(…)The staff members lovingly assist our kids with crafts, sports and
other physical fitness games. (…) I feel like I can really let my guard down at
this park because it’s removed from the street.  It takes the stress off
me.” -  Jessica W., parent
“If we don’t bring them to the park, the kids just watch TV or play
video games at home. Our place is really small. If I don’t bring her to the
park, she bounces off the walls.” -  Maritza R., parent
Our Campaign: Fund Community School Parks!
Over the last two years, our Community School Parks thrived, but since
the beginning of 2015, due to recent funding cuts, we have not been able to
reopen these parks.
http://beverlypress.com/2014/12/vine-street-elementary-park-partnership-in-peril/
We are coming to you to help us reopen our Community School Parks at
Trinity and Vine Elementary Schools.  The process is inexpensive and
easy.  It costs just about $6000 dollars to keep one school park
open every Saturday for one year.  This means $12,000 to open both parks
one day a week (which is our goal for this campaign) and $24,000 to keep both
parks open all weekend (which is our long-term goal).  These funds pay
for a LAUSD youth specialist or district-approved parent
representative to open and close the gates and keep the site supervised. This
dollar amount also pays for supplies and custodial time.
 
If we raise over $12,000, we’ll extend hours, so that these parks stay
open as much as possible.  If we make it to $60,000, we can keep both
parks open on the weekends and after school every day all year!
If this campaign is really successful, all donations over $60k will go
towards funding our Community School Park Incubator.  What is this? Based
on the success of our two pilot sites, our organization is now launching the
Community School Park Incubator Program wherein we train principals, parents
and other community members on Community School Park development, safety and
maintenance as well as district policy and civic engagement.  We want
children, youth, families and their neighbors to have the skills and resources
needed to transform their school sites into sustainable neighborhood parks of
their own.
Your tax-deductible donations will not only reopen parks in two communities that
desperately need them.  It will also show that through grassroots support,
anyone can fund a project like this in their community, regardless of their zip
code.  That is, if people are provided the right resources, are
organized and receive a helping hand by people like YOU, they can come
together to reinvigorate public school yards.  

Thank you for your support!





Sincerely, 
Larry Watts, President - People for Parks

<div>Hello fellow honey bee advocates! </div>
<div> </div>
<p>My name is Hilary Kearney and I am an educator, beekeeper and entrepreneur. My business <a href=""http://girlnextdoorhoney.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Girl Next Door Honey</a> educates hundreds of kids each year and I want to help you do the same! </p>
<p>I created The Story of Bees game originally to enrich my own classroom presentations and kids' workshops. I have been playing the game with excited kiddos for many years with great success. Now, I want to share my game with you and make it available to other educators, parents and friends of the bees.</p>
<p>Part of what makes this game so fun, is that it's not your typical board game. It's not a board game at all. It's an imagination game that helps adults to facilitate educational play. Kids get to physically act their worker bee jobs while the queen bee (adult) guides them through colony life. Play it outside or in a large room so players can run, buzz and dance! The game works best in conjunction with a formal lesson on bees. It can be used to reinforce what they have learned in the lesson. This game is also great for teaching important life lessons like: leadership, problem solving and teamwork. Once the kids know how to play, the queen bee role can be handed off to one of the kids and they can be free to expand upon the game structure and get even more creative. </p>
<p>I believe educating our little ones is the best way to ensure a bee-friendly future for our important pollinator friends. Let's help others create fun, educational learning opportunities in their communities by bringing this game to print! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Last year, I did a small-run print of the game and shipped copies all over the world. The game was so popular, we sold out!

I am constantly receiving emails and messages about when the game will be back in stock.</p>

<p>We need to raise...</p>

<p>** Anything we raise over this goal, will be used to fund future educational products. I am always dreaming up new ways to educate people about bees!</p>

<p>For the last 3 years, on the Bahamian
island of Eleuthera, the Burrows Family has been working with a team of local businesses and international
conservationists to
create Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve. This is the <i><b>first
privately managed marine reserve in the Bahamas</b></i>, and is named after
Mr. Edwin Burrows, who, along with his wife Gertrude, first homesteaded at the
lake in the 1950's.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, Edwin Burrows'
descendants are revitalizing the
use and protection of Turtle Lake, by <i><b>combining conservation efforts with
sustainable income sources</b></i> to manage the Reserve. This partnership is using
Indiegogo to fund the launch of an Interpretive and Paddle Sports Center, the first
step in a larger campaign to expand the size of the Reserve.</p>
<p></p>

</h3>
<p>Your funding will enable our partnership to upgrade Edwin Burrows' original turtle hatching beach and turtle rearing alcove, build a small pier so renting kayaks and paddlers boards can access the lake, install a solar power system to energize these facilities, and add interpretative signs about the lake’s natural and cultural history for visitors to read.</p>
<h3><b><i>   The Cultural and Natural History of
Turtle Lake</i></b></h3>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At the center of this project is Turtle Lake and the Burrows Family.  Turtle Lake is a 43-acre inland saltwater lake nestled on the Caribbean side of Eleuthera, and connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a cave system underneath the island. Turtle Lake is just south of Governor's Harbour, Eleuthera's main settlement, and an important point of interest and entry for tourists from around the world.</span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1044380/files/20141124180158-Indiegogo_Edwin.png?1416880918"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Edwin Burrows, and his wife Gertrude, were early settlers in this part of Eleuthera. While raising 14 kids, they found time to open a bar on Cupids Cay, farm pineapples and vegetables, and raise turtles and fish. <b><i>Edwin’s love of the sea and entrepreneurial spirit met a certain harmony at Turtle Lake</i></b>. </span></p>
<p>Sheltered from the wind, waves, and predators of the open sea, the lake was an ideal place to raise turtles and fish. Mr. Burrows placed sand along a section of shoreline to create a turtle-egg laying beach, and reared some of the baby turtles in a small rock-lined alcove nearby. When the turtles where large enough, he would release some in the ocean, and some back into the lake. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1044236/files/20141124171545-tl_recreation_collage_v3_with_mangrove_reef__1_.jpg?1416878145"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">In order to protect his use of, and vision for, Turtle Lake, Mr. Burrows secured a lease from the Bahamian Government for exclusive use of the lake. The lease granted him the rights to use Turtle Lake and some adjacent land for his conservation and income activities. It is that same <i><b>marriage of economy and ecology that has inspired Edwin’s descendants</b></i> to join forces with a team of local and international interests to formally establish Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve.</span><br/></p>
<p>What makes Turtle Lake unique is that it is an inland saltwater lake, technically called a ""blue hole."" <b><i>Among the worlds most unique and fragile marine environments</i></b>, blue holes are inland caves or underwater sinkholes connected to the ocean. Turtle Lake is part of an inland cave system, whose salty waters come from the ocean. And yes, that means the level of Turtle Lake goes up and down with the tides. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Better yet, Turtle Lake is a place where paddle water sports and other forms of recreation can co-exist with the native marine life. This means Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve can be a <i><b>sanctuary for sea turtles and other marine wildlife, a serene place for water recreation, and a source of environmentally sustainable income</b></i> that supports Eleuthera's economy.</p>

Turtle Lake Reserve</i></b></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Back in the day, Edwin Burrows built for his use what we now affectionately refer to as the Bottle Shack, because one side of his place was made with soda bottles – a common practice in those days to allow light into a building and add artistic flair. This historic building, when upgraded with solar generated electricity and a few other modern amenities paid for by this Indiegogo campaign, will serve as Reserve’s first center of activities (conservation, education, and recreation). </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Close to the Reserve’s “center”, we will build a pier off a recently cosntructed small deck, so that visitors can more easily access the lake with their kayaks and paddleboards, or watch wildlife from the end of the pier. As well, we will install more and better interpretive signs letting visitors know about the natural history and conservation of Turtle Lake.</p>

Help fund a project to protect sea turtles and other marine life while providing sustainable incomes to the local Bahamian economy.



For the last 3 years, on the Bahamian
island of Eleuthera, the Burrows Family has been working with a team of local businesses and international
conservationists to
create Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve. This is the first
privately managed marine reserve in the Bahamas, and is named after
Mr. Edwin Burrows, who, along with his wife Gertrude, first homesteaded at the
lake in the 1950's.
Sixty years later, Edwin Burrows'
descendants are revitalizing the
use and protection of Turtle Lake, by combining conservation efforts with
sustainable income sources to manage the Reserve. This partnership is using
Indiegogo to fund the launch of an Interpretive and Paddle Sports Center, the first
step in a larger campaign to expand the size of the Reserve.




That is where you come in…. to help fund the establishment of this center of conservation and sustainable income, as a first step in making Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve a model for island and marine conservation throughout the Bahamas and beyond.

Your funding will enable our partnership to upgrade Edwin Burrows' original turtle hatching beach and turtle rearing alcove, build a small pier so renting kayaks and paddlers boards can access the lake, install a solar power system to energize these facilities, and add interpretative signs about the lake’s natural and cultural history for visitors to read.
   The Cultural and Natural History of
Turtle Lake

At the center of this project is Turtle Lake and the Burrows Family.  Turtle Lake is a 43-acre inland saltwater lake nestled on the Caribbean side of Eleuthera, and connected to the Atlantic Ocean through a cave system underneath the island. Turtle Lake is just south of Governor's Harbour, Eleuthera's main settlement, and an important point of interest and entry for tourists from around the world.


Edwin Burrows, and his wife Gertrude, were early settlers in this part of Eleuthera. While raising 14 kids, they found time to open a bar on Cupids Cay, farm pineapples and vegetables, and raise turtles and fish. Edwin’s love of the sea and entrepreneurial spirit met a certain harmony at Turtle Lake. 
Sheltered from the wind, waves, and predators of the open sea, the lake was an ideal place to raise turtles and fish. Mr. Burrows placed sand along a section of shoreline to create a turtle-egg laying beach, and reared some of the baby turtles in a small rock-lined alcove nearby. When the turtles where large enough, he would release some in the ocean, and some back into the lake. 




In order to protect his use of, and vision for, Turtle Lake, Mr. Burrows secured a lease from the Bahamian Government for exclusive use of the lake. The lease granted him the rights to use Turtle Lake and some adjacent land for his conservation and income activities. It is that same marriage of economy and ecology that has inspired Edwin’s descendants to join forces with a team of local and international interests to formally establish Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve.
What makes Turtle Lake unique is that it is an inland saltwater lake, technically called a ""blue hole."" Among the worlds most unique and fragile marine environments, blue holes are inland caves or underwater sinkholes connected to the ocean. Turtle Lake is part of an inland cave system, whose salty waters come from the ocean. And yes, that means the level of Turtle Lake goes up and down with the tides. How cool is that?
Better yet, Turtle Lake is a place where paddle water sports and other forms of recreation can co-exist with the native marine life. This means Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve can be a sanctuary for sea turtles and other marine wildlife, a serene place for water recreation, and a source of environmentally sustainable income that supports Eleuthera's economy.




Upgrading the “Bottle Shack” and Other Facilities at
Turtle Lake Reserve

Back in the day, Edwin Burrows built for his use what we now affectionately refer to as the Bottle Shack, because one side of his place was made with soda bottles – a common practice in those days to allow light into a building and add artistic flair. This historic building, when upgraded with solar generated electricity and a few other modern amenities paid for by this Indiegogo campaign, will serve as Reserve’s first center of activities (conservation, education, and recreation). 
Close to the Reserve’s “center”, we will build a pier off a recently cosntructed small deck, so that visitors can more easily access the lake with their kayaks and paddleboards, or watch wildlife from the end of the pier. As well, we will install more and better interpretive signs letting visitors know about the natural history and conservation of Turtle Lake.




This conservation and education center, as well as the paddle water sports sustainable business, will both be launched this December – even before this campaign is finished. We want to get started, as winter tourists are starting to arrive. Your funding will mean we can finish restoring all of the facilities Mr. Burrows built (the Bottle Shack, and the original turtle hatching beach and rearing alcove), as well as add the new structures and equipment, as soon as possible after the formal launch of the center and business. 
You won’t be paying for any salaries, only to help ensure a successful start to a new social enterprise that supports the mission of Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve. What's not to like about that? We think it is a great plan, one we are moving forward on because of our hope, even our confidence, that you will help us reach our goal of raising $17,500 to pay for these necessary upgrades and purchases.
We
thank you for your support.... and so do the sea turtles and other wildlife of
Turtle Lake!




Below you can more read about the opportunity and the challenge we are addressing through our
long-term plans for Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve, and how your support will help us leverage an
additional $500,000+ for the conservation of Turtle Lake’s critical
shoreline habitat.

The Opportunity and the Challenge


Tourism in the Bahamas accounts for
more than 60% of the country’s economy, and provides about 50% of all the jobs.
Most of that revenue has come from periodic booms in construction of new hotels, resorts, and residences
during the past 30+ years, development funded largely by investments and
tourism dollars from the United States and Canada. Yet, this success has its
challenges. 
When the economies to the north went south between
2007-2011,
the Bahamian economy shrank too. The tourism and construction industries
have not fully recovered, which means fewer jobs for locals. Making matters
worse for the island of Eleuthera, their large-scale tourism boom dropped off
back in the 90’s, taking a lot of local jobs with it.
Second, this growth in hotels, resorts, and residences
has reduced the amount of native habitat onshore, and large-scale tourism
increases the human impact on the marine ecology. Part of what makes Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve so special is that, given its
unique beauty and natural features, it has not been developed. At least not
yet.

Possible Development on the Shores of
Turtle Lake


There
are, however, proposals to develop the eastern and western shoreline of Turtle Lake. A forty acre parcel on the eastern
shoreline is slated for a large, multi-lot subdivision with 100 new homes. The
likely sale and development of eight acres on the lake’s western shoreline would
add insult to injury. These developments would have significant, undesired
effects on Turtle Lake as a unique “blue hole” with its sensitive underground
“plumbing”, as a wildlife sanctuary and breeding ground for green turtles, and
as a highly desired Bahamian recreation and wilderness experience for locals
and tourists alike.

                          The Team and the Plan
The team of people establishing Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve have a
plan for ensuring Turtle Lake remains a natural sanctuary for both people and
wildlife. Along with Edwin Burrows’ descendants, this team includes marine biologists and ecologists, geographers, architects,
and hydrologists, organized by the Kinship Conservation Fellows to develop the
strategy, summarized in this report.






Their work has been supported by the
International League of Conservation Photographers, Kinship Conservation Foundation, Eleuthera-based The Island School, Woodbury University Graduate School of Architecture and New West Land Company, the non-profit Mermaid Islands, and Gillilan
Associates. Finally, local businesses such as Pineapple Fields Resort are providing their expertise,
connections, and support.




How Your Support Will Help Us Buy
Those Lands(or…. how $17,500 can secure $500,000+ for conservation)



A primary conservation goal of Edwin's Turtle Lake
Marine Reserve is to purchase 48 acres along the lakeshore, and combine it with
the Burrows’ existing land to enlarge the size of the reserve. Some of that
land could be used to develop a conservation, environmental education, and
retreat center that will support the reserve’s economic sustainability, and
strengthen its conservation value. This plan is based on the concept of
“market-based conservation,” where sustainably managed profit centers are
embedded in a land and water conservation strategy. 
The first phase of this plan is to
develop an Interpretive and Paddle Sports Center on the Burrows’ land. This facility will serve as the foundation of an environmentally
sustainable business model for the conservation and appropriate use of Turtle
Lake. 
With your support, we will be able to:
1) 
launch a family-run business that provides low-impact
water recreation activities to visitors from near and far;
2) provide interpretative signs and other educational
materials that tell visitors about the natural and cultural history of this fascinating
blue hole environment; 
3) 
expand the green sea turtle breeding
and conservation program Edwin Burrows started more than 50 years
ago.





What Your Money Will Specifically Pay
For:

•Construction of a small pier off of the just installed deck at the Center, so visitors can launch their paddleboards and kayaks from the pier.
•Restore Edwin's turtle hatchling rearing alcove, a small area he created years ago so the lake’s juvenile green turtles could live while avoiding getting eaten by large fish in the lake. 
•Install interpretative signs and artwork that will tell the story of Turtle Lake’s natural and cultural history.
•Install solar power and hot water systems needed to run the Center.
•Purchase additional kayaks and paddle boards to be rented, and build a storage facility for this equipment.
With your support now, the Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve partnership will be able to build the foundation upon which it can first protect the watershed surrounding the Lake (through conservation easements and land purchases), and then establish a comprehensive program and facility for studying, conserving, and enjoying the blue hole ecosystem known as Turtle Lake.

How Could We use Funds Beyond our Indiegogo Goal?
If we are fortunate enough to raise more than $17,500, these extra funds will be dedicated to additional infrastructure upgrades, land and mangrove conservation efforts through establishing a fund for purchase and/or conservation easement.  In addition, we will conduct important research on Turtle Lake.  Since the lake is free of plastics, fishing gear and pollutants found in the ocean, it is an important reference condition for assessing turtle and fish life history and diets.  We will also investigate the feasibility of releasing juvenile turtles to augment threatened wild populations. 
Additional Infrastructure Stretch Goal: $15,000
The business plan calls for the construction of a gazebo at the end of the pier that we will build with this campaign.  The purpose of the gazebo is to provide a wildlife viewing and research platform, a lunch spot in the shade, a gathering spot and simply a place to drink in the beauty of Turtle Lake.




Think of yourself as investing in a start-up business (the Interpretative and Paddle Sports Center, run by the Burrows family) that – if all goes according to plan – will soon blossom into a model for island and marine conservation. We think that’s a darn good investment, where your dollars now can leverage an environmentally and economically beneficial program you can be proud of for decades to come.




Wouldn't it be great to be able to say, “I helped make the Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve a reality.” We think so. To that end, we thank you for whatever level of financial support you can give. And we look forward to including you in “our” mutual vision for Edwin's Turtle Lake Marine Reserve.

A: “Blue hole” is the term for water-bodies formed by limestone sinkholes, or submarine caves.  They are given their name because of the contrasting deep blue of the hole and the lighter blue of the shallows around them.  Some blue holes are located within the ocean, while others, such as Turtle Lake (pictured below), are inland systems more similar to lakes but are tidally connected - in the case of Turtle Lake, to the Atlantic Ocean though it sits closer to the Caribbean Sea coastline.  Because of unique water quality and isolation of the cave system, each blue hole have their own distinctive biodiversity with National Geographic calling them ""among the least studied and most threatened habitats on Earth"".Q: How did the sea turtles get into the lake? A: Mr. Edwin Burrows placed a few live turtles in the lake in the 1950's and 60's that were caught in his fishing nets.  He made a small beach along the shore and soon started raising turtles (see picture with notes from Edwin below).Some of these original turtles continue to live in the lake today.  The rest of the turtles have been hatched and reared naturally in the lake at the beach we recently restored (picture below).Q: Where is Turtle Lake and Eleuthera?A: The island of Eleuthera lies 58 miles east of Nassau, Bahamas and 250 miles southeast of the southern tip of Florida, USA. Q: How did Mr. Burrows secure the rights to the lake?A: He got a lease from the Bahamian government to use the lake.  The lease is renewed annually by the Burrows Family.  Q: What socio-economic impacts can I expect with my
contribution to the campaign?
A:  One of our criteria’s for project success is the
ability to generate jobs and income in an economically challenged
community.  We feel this will be realized within months of
opening the Reserve.  A larger strategy that we are engaged in with other
local partners is to re-brand Governor’s Harbor and Eleuthera as a sustainable tourism
destination targeting active life-style tourists, the fastest growing segment
of travelers from North America and Europe.
Q: How do I become more involved with the project besides
monetary support?
A:  We are always recruiting team members to join us on
our project development visits, with our next research trip scheduled for March 29
– April 11.  On that trip we will be focusing on conservation
science, (marine, terrestrial/botanical, birds, mapping, planning) and
supporting the staff at the Reserve with business development, training and
mentoring.  We have found it easy to incorporate citizen scientists so
anyone with a sincere interest in our work is welcome to join us.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Kite Collective is a group of kite-makers and artists based in New York City. We offer kites to the public in creative, interactive ways.
 

 
Why Kites?
 
Kites are a means of disconnecting from our smart phones and reconnecting with the sky, ourselves and the world around us. Kite flying is our way of navigating the omnipresent forces of the wind and ""looking up"" toward a vibrant, resilient community landscape.
 
The Kite Machine Project
 
The Kite Machine is a travelling kite dispenser that provides miniature kites for the public. The first installation took place at local taco joint Rockaway Taco in NYC last Summer. The project went swimmingly and we were able to provide kites to over 600 people in the Rockaways. Locals and tourists alike all pitched in to help make kites for the machine, telling stories and having laughs along the way and building community from the ground up. 
 

 
 
 
This year, we're bringing the Kite Machine to Governor's Island. Our goal is to see 5,000 kites in the sky!!! 
 
 

 
Governor's Island
 
Not only is Governor's Island one of New York City's historic treasures, but it is the perfect place to fly a kite — there are acres of open green space to run and plenty of wind off the Harbor. Governor's Island is open from May through September on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. During this time, the machine will be stocked with easy-to-fly kite kits for the public.
 

 
We will be stocking the machine each week with these awesome, reusable kite kits by Lindsay Powers. ""The Mini Kite Kit"" comes with a compact, colourful kite that unfolds to a standard-size kite for all to enjoy. Fun for kids and adults alike, this nostalgic kit will bring you back to the happy-go-lucky days of your childhood and chase away your worries in no time. 
 
Miniature Kite Kit
 

 
PERKS!
 
 
Here are some of the perks you'll be getting in exchange for your contribution to the Kite Machine:
 
Handmade Kites by the Kite Collective 
 

Left, ROCK series kite. Right, SLED series kite. 
 
Limited-edition Kite Pins 
 

Various kite pins designed by famed artists and kite-makers.
 
Kite Art Books
 

Left, Kites: Paper Wings Over Japan. Right, Japanese Kite Prints
 
Donations are tax-deductible through our Fiscal Sponsor organization, 501(c)(3) Fractured Atlas. If we exceed our goal, we can continue the project for longer, conduct more workshops and have more kites in the sky for all to enjoy. 
 
Arts Programming
 
We plan to do a series of kite-making workshops at Governor’s Island every weekend. Workshops include a kite-making demonstration, kite-making materials, guest speakers and are available to the public free of charge. 
 

 
In the past, we have taught kite-making classes at Trade School, hosted at the Museum of Art & Design, Built in Brooklyn Craft Fair and NurtureArt's Lawn School.
 
Other Ways to Support
 
Help us keep the project growing by contributing what you can.  Please follow us on Facebook and share the project with your friends and loved ones. For volunteer opportunities, contact kitecollective@gmail.com.

Atlanta Black Cracker's Lab Camp
 
We are creating an outdoor laboratory to explore the revitalizing influence of a living growing space and observatory in the Bush Mountain Community. Our laboratory is situated in the Historical Atlanta Black Cracker Field. In the 1920s and 1930s during the height of the National Negro League and deep segregation in the south, the Atlanta Black Crackers utilized this site. Serving as a community center this space created an atmosphere of connectivity and fellowship through outdoor recreation. 


Development of this currently under-utilized 2 acre site will include an interactive native planting and historical vegetable and fruit mini-farm. Additions will be made to the existing campground which holds the annual Great American Backyard Campout. There will be information about the historical significance of the land as well as an art installation tribute to the Atlanta Black Crackers Baseball Team.






   Strategic Plan
The site will be cleared of invasive brush and debris.  The organic material will be gathered and burned in the newly constructed fire pit which will be located at the site where the annual Great American Backyard Campout is held.  Using existing clay soil we will construct an outdoor oven for bread making and food prep.

<p>Hi,my name is Douglas Fairburn and my team and I are embarking on this Indiegogo crowd source fundraiser to bring an alternative energy conservation fuel savings technology to the free market.Two things to remember “Necessity is the mother of invention” and “The simplest things work the best”</p>
<p> I was an owner operator over the road trucker with my own authority and had to come up with a way to save fuel to stay in business. Therefore a way to save fuel (the largest single expense in the trucking industry) was paramount in the conception and development of the “Air Channeler”.   Reducing drag is one of the most significant ways to increase <strong>Miles per Gallon</strong> specifically on tractor trailers so thats the direction I went!.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need $340,000</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>million Dollar Goal </strong>is a symbolic representation of how relatively small the cost is in solving our fuel and environmental problem.</p>
<p>This is little compared to the almost 1.5 <strong>BILLION</strong> gallons of diesel fuel that can be saved or $4.42 <strong>billion</strong> in fuel costs to the United States (the people) annually. Let’s not forget the reduced (CO2) emissions of 32.7<strong> billion</strong> pounds or (16.4 million tons)</p>
<p>The United States will enter 2012 with a population of roughly 312.8 million people according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s end of 2011 estimate. </p>
<p>If we reach 1% of the people that would amount to 3 million people.</p>
<p> We are trying to reach just 1 million people who care enough to donate 35 cents for a global cause or 500,000 people donating $.50 or 250,000 to donate $1.00 or 125,000 donating $2.00 but you get the point.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to promote the use of energy conservation-based technologies to help save our environment, our natural resources and the economy.</p>
<p> Manufacturing prototype trailers, attorneys, insurance, acquiring time on a test track and/ or attaining non-government funded use of computational resources can become costly.</p>
<p><strong><strong>What We Need $340,000</strong></strong></p>
<p>At least $340,000 and the breakdown is as follows as of the NOV 2009 proposal for the “SAE J1321 Fuel Consumption Testing for SmartWay Approval” to be performed at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) an independent, nonprofit applied research and development organization in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Conduct a single test at the test track per EPA SmartWay protocol $64,500.</p>
<p>A single test includes the Baseline segment and one Test Segment.</p>
<p>Conduct additional test segments $18,000 each plus equipment rental.</p>
<p>  $64,500</p>
<p>  $18,000</p>
<p>  $18,000</p>
<p>  $<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">18,000</span></p>
<p>  $118,500</p>
<p> Minus (1) test, plus there tractor rentals (2) and add for inflation we are still looking at around $120,000</p>
<p> We need an additional $120,000 for manufacturing per our specifications (4) identical trailers $30,000 each straight off the assembly line.</p>
<p>(2) with the integral designs, one with swing open doors and one with the roll up door </p>
<p>(1) for the add-on apparatus or device design. </p>
<p>(1) trailer as a control trailer as the test track has no way of providing a trailer of identical quantifiable product to match against the test trailers.</p>
<p> We need $100,000 for miscellaneous cost such as attorney’s fees, insurance, transportation cost for shipping these trailers to the test track.</p>
<p> $120,000</p>
<p> $120,000</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> $100,000  </span></p>
<p>$340,000     </p>
<p><strong>What We Need $340,000</strong> is the bottom line of what it will take to make a <span style="""">change in fuel, pollution and the economic workings of the world as this is a global cause.</span></p>
<p> This is your chance to shine, consciousness is the substance of the universe therefor it is behavior that is important. Trust in your own power of observation and judgment as the greatest truths are by necessity, simple.</p>
<p>  Please help support an energy technology that empowers the individual, which gives you the people, a point of action.  If you want alternative energy answers or a solution to save fuel, you don’t ask an oil economy to produce it for you.</p>
<p> The Transportation Industry will not accept any fuel savings technologies except those that the Department Of Energy’s Office of Air Quality’s <strong>SmartWay Transportation Partnership</strong> recognizes. We have to have this Certification!</p>
<p> <strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p> Don’t expect answers or real solutions  from an oil based economy. We have to do this ourselves, a free market is what makes and keeps America great.</p>
<p> By helping us certify and bring this device to a free market you are directly supporting practices that give back to the environment rather than deplete it.</p>
<p><em>You are, in effect part of the solution.</em></p>
<p><em>This opens the door to increased sustainable clean energy technology and alleviating pollution.</em></p>
<p><em>Help create job opportunities; Bring industry back to American workers </em></p>
<p><em>Bring </em>back a strong economy by spending less at the pump and more at the mall</p>
<p><em>Save natural fossil fuel resources decrease CO2 in our atmosphere</em></p>
<p><em>Decrease our dependence on foreign oil and secure our national security </em></p>
<p><em>Effectively this will bring down the cost of every product you use, as every product you touch is delivered by a big truck! </em></p>
<p> <strong>How the AirChanneler Works?</strong></p>
<p>Reducing drag is accomplished by directly connecting the high pressure air on the front or sides of a vehicle to the centrally located low pressure area on the rear or base of the vehicle through the AirChanneler.<strong> For more information </strong>check out our web site  <a href=""http://www.airchanneler.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.airchanneler.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Specifics of the Device:</strong></p>
<p>This device can be manufactured as an integral design into new trailers and as an add-on apparatus or device that can be applied to older trailers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Makes The AirChanneler Unique?</strong></p>
<p>TheAirChanneler is simple in design it uses no outside power sources to operate, it can be manufactured and is easy to install at low cost and can be used on almost any vehicle without significant after-market modification. It does not require driver intervention or interfere with normal driving operations or loading dock procedures.</p>
<p>We are also the only drag reduction device in the world capable of re-introducing drag when braking or slowing down. Using our patented damper to shut off the air  flow thru the AirChanneler vent allows the re-introduction of drag for no more than normal operating tempters on the braking components than necessary.</p>
<p> <strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong></p>
<p>Your donations are still so important and welcome! We understand that not everyone can contribute financially but that does not mean that you can't help!</p>
<p>You can contribute simply by sharing our story and this campaign with as many people as possible for the entire length of our campaign!</p>
<p>Phone two friends, use your E-mail Facebook, Myspace, LinkedIn or the tools provided by Indiegogo and spread the word, send people to our website and our blog!  Just your prayers or kindest thoughts are so appreciated or at least hit the like button. Thank you so much for sharing and caring.</p>
<p><strong>Going beyond </strong></p>
<p>Our vision is to raise awareness and use the AirChanneler technologies to help develop and make affordable other alternative technologies that use Direct Air Capture (DAC) where carbon dioxide is captured using a filter that selectively removes the (CO2) from the air. The carbonates (Co2) are then sequestered from the filter and recycled.  This technology would reduce (CO2) by a few more billion pounds or million tons also.  For more information please search the web Direct air capture. Government statistics are that if all of the 1.3 million Class 8 trucks that are registered in this country were getting a12 percent fuel savings the United States could annually save almost 1.5 billion gallons of diesel fuel, reduce (CO2) carbon dioxide by 32.7 billion pounds or (16.4 tons) and can save $4.42 billion in fuel costs.</p>
<p>We truly can’t accomplish this without your help. Please go to our website <a href=""http://www.airchanneler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.airchanneler.com</a> to take a look at our photos, and keep sharing!</p>

</div></div>","Hi,my name is Douglas Fairburn and my team and I are embarking on this Indiegogo crowd source fundraiser to bring an alternative energy conservation fuel savings technology to the free market.Two things to remember “Necessity is the mother of invention” and “The simplest things work the best”
 I was an owner operator over the road trucker with my own authority and had to come up with a way to save fuel to stay in business. Therefore a way to save fuel (the largest single expense in the trucking industry) was paramount in the conception and development of the “Air Channeler”.   Reducing drag is one of the most significant ways to increase Miles per Gallon specifically on tractor trailers so thats the direction I went!.
What We Need $340,000
The million Dollar Goal is a symbolic representation of how relatively small the cost is in solving our fuel and environmental problem.
This is little compared to the almost 1.5 BILLION gallons of diesel fuel that can be saved or $4.42 billion in fuel costs to the United States (the people) annually. Let’s not forget the reduced (CO2) emissions of 32.7 billion pounds or (16.4 million tons)
The United States will enter 2012 with a population of roughly 312.8 million people according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s end of 2011 estimate. 
If we reach 1% of the people that would amount to 3 million people.
 We are trying to reach just 1 million people who care enough to donate 35 cents for a global cause or 500,000 people donating $.50 or 250,000 to donate $1.00 or 125,000 donating $2.00 but you get the point.
Our Mission:
Our mission is to promote the use of energy conservation-based technologies to help save our environment, our natural resources and the economy.
 Manufacturing prototype trailers, attorneys, insurance, acquiring time on a test track and/ or attaining non-government funded use of computational resources can become costly.
What We Need $340,000
At least $340,000 and the breakdown is as follows as of the NOV 2009 proposal for the “SAE J1321 Fuel Consumption Testing for SmartWay Approval” to be performed at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) an independent, nonprofit applied research and development organization in San Antonio, Texas.
Conduct a single test at the test track per EPA SmartWay protocol $64,500.
A single test includes the Baseline segment and one Test Segment.
Conduct additional test segments $18,000 each plus equipment rental.
  $64,500
  $18,000
  $18,000
  $18,000
  $118,500
 Minus (1) test, plus there tractor rentals (2) and add for inflation we are still looking at around $120,000
 We need an additional $120,000 for manufacturing per our specifications (4) identical trailers $30,000 each straight off the assembly line.
(2) with the integral designs, one with swing open doors and one with the roll up door 
(1) for the add-on apparatus or device design. 
(1) trailer as a control trailer as the test track has no way of providing a trailer of identical quantifiable product to match against the test trailers.
 We need $100,000 for miscellaneous cost such as attorney’s fees, insurance, transportation cost for shipping these trailers to the test track.
 $120,000
 $120,000
 $100,000  
$340,000     
What We Need $340,000 is the bottom line of what it will take to make a change in fuel, pollution and the economic workings of the world as this is a global cause.
 This is your chance to shine, consciousness is the substance of the universe therefor it is behavior that is important. Trust in your own power of observation and judgment as the greatest truths are by necessity, simple.
  Please help support an energy technology that empowers the individual, which gives you the people, a point of action.  If you want alternative energy answers or a solution to save fuel, you don’t ask an oil economy to produce it for you.
 The Transportation Industry will not accept any fuel savings technologies except those that the Department Of Energy’s Office of Air Quality’s SmartWay Transportation Partnership recognizes. We have to have this Certification!
 The Impact:
 Don’t expect answers or real solutions  from an oil based economy. We have to do this ourselves, a free market is what makes and keeps America great.
 By helping us certify and bring this device to a free market you are directly supporting practices that give back to the environment rather than deplete it.
You are, in effect part of the solution.
This opens the door to increased sustainable clean energy technology and alleviating pollution.
Help create job opportunities; Bring industry back to American workers 
Bring back a strong economy by spending less at the pump and more at the mall
Save natural fossil fuel resources decrease CO2 in our atmosphere
Decrease our dependence on foreign oil and secure our national security 
Effectively this will bring down the cost of every product you use, as every product you touch is delivered by a big truck! 
 How the AirChanneler Works?
Reducing drag is accomplished by directly connecting the high pressure air on the front or sides of a vehicle to the centrally located low pressure area on the rear or base of the vehicle through the AirChanneler. For more information check out our web site  www.airchanneler.com
 
Specifics of the Device:
This device can be manufactured as an integral design into new trailers and as an add-on apparatus or device that can be applied to older trailers.
 
What Makes The AirChanneler Unique?
TheAirChanneler is simple in design it uses no outside power sources to operate, it can be manufactured and is easy to install at low cost and can be used on almost any vehicle without significant after-market modification. It does not require driver intervention or interfere with normal driving operations or loading dock procedures.
We are also the only drag reduction device in the world capable of re-introducing drag when braking or slowing down. Using our patented damper to shut off the air  flow thru the AirChanneler vent allows the re-introduction of drag for no more than normal operating tempters on the braking components than necessary.
 OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
Your donations are still so important and welcome! We understand that not everyone can contribute financially but that does not mean that you can't help!
You can contribute simply by sharing our story and this campaign with as many people as possible for the entire length of our campaign!
Phone two friends, use your E-mail Facebook, Myspace, LinkedIn or the tools provided by Indiegogo and spread the word, send people to our website and our blog!  Just your prayers or kindest thoughts are so appreciated or at least hit the like button. Thank you so much for sharing and caring.
Going beyond 
Our vision is to raise awareness and use the AirChanneler technologies to help develop and make affordable other alternative technologies that use Direct Air Capture (DAC) where carbon dioxide is captured using a filter that selectively removes the (CO2) from the air. The carbonates (Co2) are then sequestered from the filter and recycled.  This technology would reduce (CO2) by a few more billion pounds or million tons also.  For more information please search the web Direct air capture. Government statistics are that if all of the 1.3 million Class 8 trucks that are registered in this country were getting a12 percent fuel savings the United States could annually save almost 1.5 billion gallons of diesel fuel, reduce (CO2) carbon dioxide by 32.7 billion pounds or (16.4 tons) and can save $4.42 billion in fuel costs.
We truly can’t accomplish this without your help. Please go to our website www.airchanneler.com to take a look at our photos, and keep sharing!
Eternal Gratitude and Love

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Warren Sill packed up his possessions and headed to British Columbia in search of the elusive Kermode bear, also known as the 'Spirit Bear'. The Kermode bear is one of the most endangered species in the world, with National Geographic estimating a world population of 400-1000 of these rare subspecies of black bear in existence. Warren dreamed of capturing a Spirit Bear on film, to promote welfare and conservation efforts against the proposed bitumen Northern Gateway Pipeline, which would negatively affect the area's wilderness.</p>
<p>Warren was last seen on July 5th. An intensive air, ground and water search was conducted by the Royal Canadian Mountain Police from July 15th until July 20th.

<p>Right now, in your neighborhood – creating a Transition Street is imaginable and very possible! We’ve already launched 12 successful pilot initiatives across the US (thanks to previous support) which have gotten some <a href=""http://www.transitionus.org/stories/what-people-love-about-transition-streets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">great reviews</a> and <a href=""http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/may/04/mid-city-alternative-water-police/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media attention</a>. </p>
<p><b>We’re ready to launch Transition Streets nationally, but we need your help to share Transition Streets with your neighborhood and thousands of others!</b></p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Following the user-friendly Transition Streets Handbook, neighbors come together over seven sessions to implement simple, tested, no- and low-cost actions to cut household energy use, reduce water and waste, change how we eat and transport ourselves, and strengthen our neighborhoods at the same time. </p>
<p>This project: <b>SAVES MONEY</b> - Households cut their bills by an average of $1,000/year. <b>REDUCES CARBON</b> emissions per household by 1.3 tons per year! <b>BUILDS COMMUNITY</b> - Neighbors formed a rich social bond and glimpsed what a low-carbon future might resemble - and they liked it!</p>
<p><b>Why We Need Transition Streets:</b> Many people take individual actions to reduce their energy use and consumption of resources… But is it enough? Others want to make changes, but don’t know where to begin. Transition Streets provides a supportive and empowering format and an enjoyable process that allows neighbors to work together to significantly increase our impact and make a real difference!</p>
<p>We want to share this effective program with as many interested neighborhoods as possible, but in order to make an impact, we need your support! <b>Here’s what your donation will allow us to do:</b></p>

10 KiloWatts of continuous energy output (potentially more)
Produces required power to run it's own motor and much more
High Voltage Low Current device
Designed to last for years with minimal maintenance
Potential to store enough energy to start generator anywhere
FREE, LIMITLESS, CLEAN Energy
Adaptation to Nikola Tesla's Patent No. 511,916 Jan 2, 1894
Works harmoniously with the natural world
Roughly 2 years ago, a simple blogger, HopeGirl, posted some questions online and that is the rough start of the Fix The World Project.  Their first act, develop a working free energy device and give it away to the world, for FREE.  And that is exactly what they did on March 25, 2014.  Indeed the Quantum Energy Generator was open sourced and the manual released!  Here I am weeks later asking you to help fund something we should have had back in 1894 when Nikola Tesla patented the original idea!  Disclaimer: The entire QEG project is still in its infancy and the science behind it's working is very different than the science we were taught in school.  Please be aware the project is still in prototype phase and this campaign is aiming to raise the money to build 2 QEGs and help with the research and development of the QEG especially to learn more about the science and working of the generator.  It shows much promise though the 'science is not all the way there' yet.We all need a good change.  Limitless, clean, free energy is a great start if I do say so myself!

Aber wir haben eine Lösung, dies zu ändern und haben uns entschieden, ohne den unnötigen Plastikmüll zu leben, der sich jeden Tag durch die Unmengen von Verpackungen ständig nur vergrößert.</span></p>
<p>Wir wollen in Frühsommer 2017 in Konstanz unseren ""Back to Nature""- Unverpackt Konstanz- Laden eröffnen,wo wir Dir die Möglichkeit geben möchten, regionale Produkte ohne unnötigen Verpackungsmüll zu kaufen. Die Produkte des täglichen Bedarfs erhältst Du bei uns lose und verpackungsfrei.</p>
<p>Die Lebensmittel werden aus großen Behältern (auch als Bulk Bin bekannt) angeboten. Behältern sind eine ökologische und Ressourcen schonende Alternative zur Einwegverpackung. Dadurch kannst Du selbst die Menge für Deinen Einkauf bestimmen und deshalb verschwendest Du auch weniger Lebensmittel.</p>
<p>Behältern sind entworfen für jede Art von trockenen Lebensmitteln wie Nüsse,Linsen, Bohnen, Süßigkeiten, Kaffee in Bohnen, Getreide, Gewürze und vieles mehr. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Die Ware kannst Du direkt aus den Spendern in Deine mitgebrachten leeren Gläser, Flaschen und Stoffbeutel oder in die bei uns gekauften/geliehenen Behälter, abfüllen.</span></p>
<p>Außer Lebensmittel wird es auch Getränke, Speiseöle, Pflegeprodukte wie Waschmittel, Reinigungsmittel, Shampoo oder Seife geben.</p>
<p>Wir bevorzugen frische und nachhaltige Produkte, wie Obst und Gemüse aus ökologischem Anbau von regionalen Lieferanten und Landwirten rund um den Bodensee mit dem Ziel die Ressourcen unserer Erde zu schonen. </p>
<p>Unverpackte Lebensmittel sorgen für eine „umweltfreundlichere"" Art des Einkaufens. Es werden beim Transport als auch beim Abpacken weniger Ressourcen verbraucht. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Darüber hinaus hat die Vermeidung von Einwegverpackungen den Vorteil, dass wertvolle Ressourcen, wie Wasser und Erdöl,geschont werden.</span></p>
<p>Durch das direkte Beziehen der Waren von den Bauern sparen wir uns den Verpackungsmüll. Außerdem möchten wir die lokale und regionale Landwirtschaft unterstützen. Da das Geld vermehrt in der Region bleibt, werden auch regionale Arbeitsplätze erhalten.</p>
<p>Neben den regionale Produkten, wird es auch ein Teil aus Bioprodukten geben. Wir kennen unseren Produkt und seine Herkunft, damit wir Dich beraten wie es hergestellt wurde und woher kommt. Alle Produkte sind ohne Weichmacher und Mikroplastik. Wir wollen in unsere reiche, lokale Region investieren, weil wir die Nahrung nicht über lange Strecken transportieren wollen, um den Ausstoß von Kohlendioxide zu vermindern welche durch die langen Lieferstrecken der LKWs entstehen.</p>
<p><span>Unsere Lieferanten lehnen Gentechnik und Spritzmittel in ihrer Landwirtschaft ab,  um die Fruchtbarkeit der Böden und deren Artenvielfalt zu erhalten. Wir pflegen diese Beziehungen und tragen dazu bei, die Verbesserung der nachhaltigen Landwirtschaft.</span></p>

<p>In early summer 2017  we want to open our ""Back to Nature"" unpacked shop in Konstanz, where we would like to give you the opportunity to buy regional products without unnecessary packaging waste. The products of the daily requirement you get with us loose and without packaging.</p>
<p>The food is offered from large containers (also known as Bulk Bin). Containers are an ecological and resource-saving alternative to disposable packaging. This way you can determine the quantity for your purchase and therefore you also waste less food.</p>
<p>Containers are designed for any kind of dry foods such as nuts, lentils, beans, sweets, coffee in beans, cereals, spices, and more.<span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>You can fill the food directly in your own jars, bottles and reusable bags or whatever you like to take them in or you can buy or borrow containers in our store. </i></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>Besides foods, there will also be beverages, cooking oils, care products such as detergents, detergents, shampo or soap.</i></span></p>
<p><i><i>We favour fresh and sustainable products,such as fruit and vegetables  ecologically grown from regional suppliers and farmers around Lake Constance aiming to preserve invaluable resources like drinking water and to completely resign from fossil fuel. </i></i></p>
<p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Unpacked food makes a more environmentally friendly way of shopping possible. As a result, fewer resources are consumed. Furthermore,  the avoidance of disposable packaging has the advantage that valuable resources such as water and oil are spared.</i></p>
<p><i><i>As we get our foods directly from the farmer we eliminate plasticwaste. Furthermore we support local and regional farming so that the money stays in the region and thus saves jobs. </i></i></p>
<p><i><i>In addition to regional products, there will also be a part of organic products. We know our product and its origin, so we can advise you how it was made and from where it comes. All products are without plasticizers and MikroPlastik. We want to invest in our rich, local region because we do not want to transport the food over long distances to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide caused by the long delivery distances of the trucks.</i></i></p>
<p><i><i>Our suppliers commit themselves to a free of genetic engineering and pesticide-free farming in order to preserve the fertility of soils and its biodiversity. We maintain these relationships and contribute to the improvement of sustainable agriculture.</i></i></p>

                                                           Our Story

Du hast sicher schon bemerkt, dass egal wo man hinschaut, sich überall Plastikmüll befindet. Aber wir haben eine Lösung, dies zu ändern und haben uns entschieden, ohne den unnötigen Plastikmüll zu leben, der sich jeden Tag durch die Unmengen von Verpackungen ständig nur vergrößert.
Wir wollen in Frühsommer 2017 in Konstanz unseren ""Back to Nature""- Unverpackt Konstanz- Laden eröffnen,wo wir Dir die Möglichkeit geben möchten, regionale Produkte ohne unnötigen Verpackungsmüll zu kaufen. Die Produkte des täglichen Bedarfs erhältst Du bei uns lose und verpackungsfrei.
Die Lebensmittel werden aus großen Behältern (auch als Bulk Bin bekannt) angeboten. Behältern sind eine ökologische und Ressourcen schonende Alternative zur Einwegverpackung. Dadurch kannst Du selbst die Menge für Deinen Einkauf bestimmen und deshalb verschwendest Du auch weniger Lebensmittel.
Behältern sind entworfen für jede Art von trockenen Lebensmitteln wie Nüsse,Linsen, Bohnen, Süßigkeiten, Kaffee in Bohnen, Getreide, Gewürze und vieles mehr. Die Ware kannst Du direkt aus den Spendern in Deine mitgebrachten leeren Gläser, Flaschen und Stoffbeutel oder in die bei uns gekauften/geliehenen Behälter, abfüllen.
Außer Lebensmittel wird es auch Getränke, Speiseöle, Pflegeprodukte wie Waschmittel, Reinigungsmittel, Shampoo oder Seife geben.
Wir bevorzugen frische und nachhaltige Produkte, wie Obst und Gemüse aus ökologischem Anbau von regionalen Lieferanten und Landwirten rund um den Bodensee mit dem Ziel die Ressourcen unserer Erde zu schonen. 
Unverpackte Lebensmittel sorgen für eine „umweltfreundlichere"" Art des Einkaufens. Es werden beim Transport als auch beim Abpacken weniger Ressourcen verbraucht. Darüber hinaus hat die Vermeidung von Einwegverpackungen den Vorteil, dass wertvolle Ressourcen, wie Wasser und Erdöl,geschont werden.
Durch das direkte Beziehen der Waren von den Bauern sparen wir uns den Verpackungsmüll. Außerdem möchten wir die lokale und regionale Landwirtschaft unterstützen. Da das Geld vermehrt in der Region bleibt, werden auch regionale Arbeitsplätze erhalten.
Neben den regionale Produkten, wird es auch ein Teil aus Bioprodukten geben. Wir kennen unseren Produkt und seine Herkunft, damit wir Dich beraten wie es hergestellt wurde und woher kommt. Alle Produkte sind ohne Weichmacher und Mikroplastik. Wir wollen in unsere reiche, lokale Region investieren, weil wir die Nahrung nicht über lange Strecken transportieren wollen, um den Ausstoß von Kohlendioxide zu vermindern welche durch die langen Lieferstrecken der LKWs entstehen.
Unsere Lieferanten lehnen Gentechnik und Spritzmittel in ihrer Landwirtschaft ab,  um die Fruchtbarkeit der Böden und deren Artenvielfalt zu erhalten. Wir pflegen diese Beziehungen und tragen dazu bei, die Verbesserung der nachhaltigen Landwirtschaft.
 
Wir wollen schonend mit den natürlichen Ressourcen & Rohstoffen umgehen, damit auch die künftigen Generationen gut leben können und ausreichend Nahrungsmittel zur Verfügung haben. So können wir alle etwas wirklich Gutes für unsere Umwelt tun.
We want to deal carefully with natural resources & raw materials, so that future generations can still live well and have enough food to their disposal. So we can all do something really good for our environment.
 
                  Follow us creating a better world
 
You've probably noticed -  no matter where you look everywhere is plastic waste. But we have a solution to change this, and we decided to live without the unnecessary plastic waste which is growing each day through the limitless use of packagings. 
In early summer 2017  we want to open our ""Back to Nature"" unpacked shop in Konstanz, where we would like to give you the opportunity to buy regional products without unnecessary packaging waste. The products of the daily requirement you get with us loose and without packaging.
The food is offered from large containers (also known as Bulk Bin). Containers are an ecological and resource-saving alternative to disposable packaging. This way you can determine the quantity for your purchase and therefore you also waste less food.
Containers are designed for any kind of dry foods such as nuts, lentils, beans, sweets, coffee in beans, cereals, spices, and more.You can fill the food directly in your own jars, bottles and reusable bags or whatever you like to take them in or you can buy or borrow containers in our store. 
Besides foods, there will also be beverages, cooking oils, care products such as detergents, detergents, shampo or soap.
We favour fresh and sustainable products,such as fruit and vegetables  ecologically grown from regional suppliers and farmers around Lake Constance aiming to preserve invaluable resources like drinking water and to completely resign from fossil fuel. 
Unpacked food makes a more environmentally friendly way of shopping possible. As a result, fewer resources are consumed. Furthermore,  the avoidance of disposable packaging has the advantage that valuable resources such as water and oil are spared.
As we get our foods directly from the farmer we eliminate plasticwaste. Furthermore we support local and regional farming so that the money stays in the region and thus saves jobs. 
In addition to regional products, there will also be a part of organic products. We know our product and its origin, so we can advise you how it was made and from where it comes. All products are without plasticizers and MikroPlastik. We want to invest in our rich, local region because we do not want to transport the food over long distances to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide caused by the long delivery distances of the trucks.
Our suppliers commit themselves to a free of genetic engineering and pesticide-free farming in order to preserve the fertility of soils and its biodiversity. We maintain these relationships and contribute to the improvement of sustainable agriculture.
 
                         Wie soll das Einkaufen 
              unverpackter Ware funktionieren?

         How does unpackaged shopping work? 

 

1. Weigh empty container   2. Fill in your desired amount   3. Pay only the content
 
                   Die Vermeidung von Plastikmüll 
                hat für den Umwelt- & Klimaschutz 
                    eine entscheidende Bedeutung
 
Mehr als 150 Millionen Tonnen Abfälle befinden sich bereits jetzt global verteilt über die Polar-Regionen bis hin zum Äquator in allen Ozeanen der Welt. 
Der Plastikmüll sammelt sich in den Zirkulationsströmungen der Ozeane endgültig an, die inzwischen auch als Müllstrudel bekannt sind. 
Heute haben wir die Spitze des Verpackungswahnsinns erreicht: Zum Beispiel Obst und Gemüse einzeln verpackt! Plastikmüll ist nicht biologisch abbaubar und sammelt sich somit in der Nahrungskette an bis Substanzen davon schließlich in unseren Blutkreislauf gelangen.
Bei der Verbrennung von einem Kilogramm Plastik entweichen etwa drei Kilogramm Kohlenstoffdioxid in die Atmosphäre. Da der Großteil allen Plastikmülls in Deutschland verbrannt wird, entstehen allein dadurch Millionen von Tonnen Kohlenstoffdioxid jährlich, die sich zusätzlich zum natürlichen Kohlenstoffkreislauf der Erde ansammeln und dadurch irreversible Probleme wie die Versauerung der Gewässer, die Änderung der Nährstoffverfügbarkeit, Probleme mit der Atmung, den Klimawandel und vieles mehr verursachen!
Rund fünf Millionen Menschen beziehen ihr Trinkwasser aus dem Bodensee. Leider ist unser schöner Bodensee, genauso wie alle Meere und Ozeane auf der Welt, mit toxischem Plastikmüll verschmutzt.
Wir wissen, dass der Kampf um die letzten fossilen Rohstoffe unsere Erde und die menschliche Existenz gefährdet. Es ist jetzt an der Zeit, etwas zu unternehmen und ein Zeichen zu setzen !
Jeder Einzelne, jede Familie, jede Gemeinschaft, jede Institution, hier bei uns und überall auf der Welt kann eine Entscheidung treffen und Teil der weltumfassenden Lösung sein. 
 

Den Plastik-Müll einfach rauszustellen, ist eine geistlose Aktivität. Du ziehst den Müll-Container einmal pro Woche auf die Straße und ein großer LKW kommt vorbei und schaufelt es für Dich weg. Hast Du dich jemals gefragt, wo all dieser Müll hingeht? Du bist nicht allein, wenn du diese Frage noch nie in Betracht gezogen hast.
Taking out the plastic trash is a mindless activity. You pull out the garbage  once a week onto the road and a big truck comes by and shovels it away for you. Did you ever wonder where all that trash goes? You’re not alone if you have never considered this question yet.
                              
                          Avoiding plastic waste 
                    is of decisive importance for 
          the environmental & climate protection 
 
More than 150 million tons of trash already swims in the ocean - spread all over the world reaching from the polar region to the equator.
The plastic waste accumulates itself finally in the circulation currents of the oceans, which in the meantime are also known as garbage patches.
Today we have got packaging madness to the top: fruit and vegetables packed separately! Plastic waste is not biologically degradable and accumulates in food cycle up to our blood cycle.

Burning 1 kilogramm plastic emitts about 3 kilogramms carbondioxid into the atmosphere. As the majority of plastic waste in Germany gets burned, millions of tons of carbondioxid emerge each year which accummulate in the natural carbon cycle on earth and causes irreversible problems like acidification of waterbodies, change of nutrient availability, breathing problems, climate change and further more! 
Approximately 5 million people get their drinking water out of Lake Constance. Unfortunately our beautiful lake is alread dumped with plastic waste just as our oceans are.
We know that the struggle for the last fossil raw materials endangers our earth and human existence. It is now time to do something and set a sign !

Every single person, every family, each society, each institution here and everywhere else on this planet can make a decision and can participate in a global solution.

                                       Zusammenfassung
 
Es geht bei unserem Projekt nicht nur darum, einen verpackungsfreien Laden zu eröffnen, sondern auch darum, die künftigen Generationen zu erziehen, damit sie in ihrem Leben wieder die Kontrolle übernehmen und wissen, wo ihre Lebensmittel herkommen und wie man sich gesund ernähren kann. 
Im Jahr 2050 werden in den Ozeanen der Welt mehr Kunststoffabfälle als Fische schwimmen. Alle Lebenskreisläufe sind durch die Ansammlung von Erdöl-Plastikmüll zunehmend negativ beeinflusst. Mensch und Umwelt werden davon krank.

  Die Verantwortung liegt allein in unseren Händen. Nur wir zusammen können die negative Entwicklung aufhalten und eine schönere, gesündere Zukunft für uns und zukünftige Generationen schaffen. Für die Erholung unseres Planeten ist eine ständige, aktive Zusammenarbeit weltweit nötig.
 
Stellen Sie sich vor, was wir alle zusammen bewirken könnten!
 
                                   The Impact
 
Our project is not only about opening a packaging-free store, but we will help educating future generations to take control of their life again - knowing where the food comes from and how to remain healthy.
If plastic consumption continues as before, by the year 2050  their will be more plastic in the sea than fish. Any kind of living cycle is affected negatively through plastic made out of fossil fuels. Man and nature is getting ill of this plastic.
 The responsibility lies solely in our hands (mankind). Only if we stand together, we can stop the negative development and create a better, healthier future for us and the following generations. For the recovery of our planet it needs a constant, active cooperation worldwide. Imagine what we could effect if we'd all work together!                                     Wer sind wir -  Who We Are

Something Good in the World is a grassroots nonprofit providing accessible, hands-on environmental education programs in Westchester County, NY.  For over 15 years, we’ve been inspiring children of all ages and backgrounds to reconnect with the natural environment and to discover their own abilities to live sustainably by immersing them in 'outdoor classrooms’. There, students connect with the natural world around them, learn about the earth’s living systems, and develop a sense of responsibility for their shared planet.  

To meet the changing needs of our planet and to educate a new crop of young environmentalists, we’re growing our children’s programs in sustainable living to include the indoors as well as the outdoors.  

We’re building the Earth School EnviraPod Education Center in northern Westchester County. EnviraPods are small, zero-footprint buildings designed for completely off-the-grid**, sustainable living.  The center will be built using eco-friendly building materials and will run entirely on renewable resources.

2013, a flock of songbirds on their migratory journey south were attracted,
“like moths to a flame,”  to a
hundred-foot-high flare at the Canaport Liquefied Natural Gas plant in Saint
John, New Brunswick.  The result
was tragic, with 7,500 to 10,000 birds of twenty-six species—mostly wood
warblers, including the endangered Canada Warbler—being killed by the
heat.  In 2015 Canaport LNG
accepted full responsibility for the bird mortality and were fined $750,000 under
the Migratory Birds Convention Act and the Species at Risk Act.</p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>Why we created ROOTS?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The growth of the word population already poses space problems in most conventional cemeteries in many countries. In Japan, notably, even is cremation is obligatory, the vaults at maximum capacity force us to think of innovative solutions to how ashes are disposed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, traditional funeral rites are being singled out because of their negative impact on the environment. A 10 acre cemetery can contain 1,000 tons of metal, 20 000 tons of cement (vaults) enough wood from coffins to build 40 houses and the equivalence of an in-ground pool of toxic liquid used for embalming.</p>
<p>And in the end, everyone dreams of immortality. To leave his/her trace. To perpetuate life.</p>
<p>No more was required to create ROOTS!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507681280/c8gyxtuzg7vikr7i37ir.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>ROOTS pays tribute with beauty and elegance because of its sober and refined design.</p>
<p>With every extraordinary thing that we accomplish in life, why should we satisfy ourselves with a mediocre or ordinary product while it is possible to combine esthetics and ecology?</p>
<p>ROOTS is currently registered for the 11th edition of the GRANDS PRIX DU DESIGN, the most important design contest in Québec awarding the best creations in design.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ecological</h3>
<p>ROOTS, both made from post-consumer matter as well as entirely natural materials is certified by the Green Burial Council as a green funeral product. That makes us extremely proud!</p>
<p><i>The Green Burial Council is the environmental certification organization setting the standard for green burial in North America.</i></p>

<p>The fertiliser stick that is provided, combined with the new material made of coffee and lime that we created, will neutralise the high pH levels of the ashes and encourage the growth of the tree once planted.</p>
<p>The use of post-consumer coffee grounds honours the sustainable development values of our company. Furthermore, its reutilisation is highly symbolic of the cycle of life.</p>

<strong>Pourquoi avoir créé </strong>ROOTS <strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>La croissance de la population mondiale pose déjà un problème d’espace dans les cimetières conventionnels, et ce dans plusieurs pays. Au Japon, en autres, même si la crémation est obligatoire, les voutes au maximum de leur capacité nous obligent à réfléchir à des solutions innovatrices pour disposer des cendres.</p>
<p>D’autre part, les rites funéraires traditionnels sont de plus pointés du doigt en raison de leur impact négatif sur l’environnement. Un cimetière de 10 acres peut contenir 1 000 tonnes de métal, 20 000 tonnes de béton (voûtes), assez de bois provenant des cercueils pour construire 40 maisons et l’équivalent d’une piscine creusée en liquides toxiques servant à l’embaumement.</p>
<p>Et finalement, tout le monde rêve d’immortalité. De laisser sa trace. De perpétuer la vie.</p>
<p>Il n’en fallait pas plus pour créer ROOTS !</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>ROOTS rend hommage avec beauté et élégance par son design sobre et épuré.</p>
<p>Avec tout ce que nous accomplissons d’extraordinaire dans la vie, pourquoi faudrait-il se contenter de produit médiocre ou ordinaire alors que c’est possible d’allier écologie et esthétisme?</p>
<p>ROOTS est actuellement inscrite à la 11e  édition des GRANDS PRIX DU DESIGN, le plus important concours québécois récompensant les meilleures réalisations en design.</p>

<h3>Écologique</h3>
<p>ROOTS, fabriquée à la fois de matière post-consommation et de matériaux entièrement naturels est <strong>certifiée produit funéraire vert par le Green Burial Council</strong> et nous en sommes très fiers !</p>

<h3>Un arbre qui pousse vraiment !</h3>
<p>Chaque urne ROOTS contiendra gracieusement 3 essences d’arbres différentes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.55pt;""> </p>
<p><strong>Efficace !</strong></p>
<p>Notre système de plantation performant et éprouvé permet de débuter la plantation de l’arbre à l’intérieur afin de maximiser sa germination et sa croissance.</p>
<p>Nous garantissons même la germination.  (*certaines conditions s’appliquent)</p>
<p>De cette façon vous avec la possibilité débuter la plantation peu importe la saison ou le moment du décès.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Polyvalent !</strong></p>
<p>Bien que nous suggérions fortement de débuter la plantation de l’arbre à l’intérieur, ROOTS peut répondre à différents besoins :</p>
<ul>
<li>Elle pourrait être plantée directement en terre.</li>
<li>Elle pourrait être utilisée simplement comme urne écologique pour ceux qui ne veulent pas nécessairement faire pousser un arbre</li>
<li>Elle peut être inhumée séparément de l’arbre. Si vous avez un lot dans un cimetière conventionnel, vous pourriez inhumer l’urne au cimetière et planter l’arbre dans un endroit significatif pour vous.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align=""center""> </h2>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Comment ça fonctionne</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>L’idée de départ est de pouvoir sentir la présence de l’être cher dans les premiers moments importants que nous vivrons sans lui; la première fête, le premier Noël, les premières vacances...</p>
<p>Le deuil est un processus difficile et l’espoir créer par l’arbre qui amorce sa croissance symbolise la vie continue.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/> Après quelques mois, lorsque l’arbre est suffisamment grand, chacun peut choisir le moment propice pour aller mettre l’urne et l’arbre en terre.</p>
<p>On respecte ainsi le rythme du processus de deuil, qui est différent pour tous.</p>

<h2 align=""center"">Équipe et R&amp;D</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Avec une équipe hautement talentueuse et professionnelle, incluant des designers industriels et une professeur-chercheure détenant un Ph.D en horticulture, nous avons travaillé pendant près de 2 ans au développement de ROOTS .</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507683649/fliquyq9gthckjoj9ewi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Au cours de la phase de recherche et développement, une centaine de matériaux naturels et inoffensifs assurant la bonne croissance d’un arbre ont été créés et testés, entre autres, pour leur rythme de biodégradabilité et leur solidité. Plusieurs recherches horticoles ont été conduites et que dire du nombre de plans qui ont été élaborés pour arriver au design sobre, épuré et fonctionnel de cette urne !</p>
<p>Nous avons investi temps, énergie et argent pour arriver à développer le meilleur produit possible qui allie design, développement durable et un système de plantation efficace et polyvalent. Nous croyons sincèrement avoir réussi et nous avons eu énormément de plaisir tout au long de cette aventure !</p>

<strong>Notre Histoire… et celle de </strong>ROOTS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Il y a longtemps que cette idée germe !</p>
<p>Ce projet s’inscrit en fait dans la 2<sup>e</sup> phase de notre entreprise, Muses Urnes Design, qui propose déjà des urnes funéraires contemporaines produites en collaboration avec des artistes/designers. </p>
<p>Le désir de créer cette entreprise, au départ, faisait suite au décès de mon beau-père il y presque 20 ans. Aucun produit funéraire ne pouvait représenter sa personnalité unique, inspirante et anticonformiste! Nous avons donc fait fabriquer une urne magnifique par un de ses amis ébénistes. Jacques a aussi son arbre hommage à la campagne qui nous permet de sentir sa présence quand nous y allons. </p>
<p>Voilà ! L’urne et l’arbre de Jacques sont à l’origine de ROOTS !</p>

<h2 align=""center"">Risques et défis</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Tout nouveau projet comporte des défis. Le développement d’un produit avec la création d’un nouveau matériau encore plus !</p>
<p>Si vous avez des questions, il nous fera plaisir d’y répondre. Vous pouvez nous rejoindre à <a href=""mailto:info@musesdesign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@musesdesign.com</a></p>
<p><strong>Le moulage du café et de la chaux</strong></p>
<p>Le matériau que nous avons créé est optimal pour la croissance de l’arbre, mais il est très difficile à mouler. Nous avons travaillé tout l’été à l’optimisation de la recette et des procédés de moulage. Nous avons eu recours aux conseils du<i> Centre de transfert technologique en écologie industrielle </i>de Sorel. L’utilisation des moules en métal pour la fabrication s’est imposée d’elle-même. Nous aurons ainsi un produit de haute qualité dont la production sera uniformisée.</p>
<p><strong>Stratification des semences </strong></p>
<p>Autres défis du côté des semences. Afin de débuter la plantation à l’intérieur, les semences utilisées ne doivent pas être en dormance. Pour ce faire, il faut soit :</p>
<ul>
<li>choisir des essences d’arbre dont les semences ne sont pas dormantes</li>
<li>faire lever la dormance par le fournisseur de semences (auquel cas elles doivent être semées immédiatement)</li>
<li>lever la dormance à la maison. (Certaines essences demandent jusqu’à 90 jours de stratification au réfrigérateur.) Pas très pratique pour notre concept… !</li>
</ul>
<p>Nous avons donc opté pour des essences non dormantes afin de maximiser la germination rapide et la plantation, peu importe la saison. Pour l’instant la sélection relativement restreinte, mais nous poursuivons nos recherches.</p>
<p>L’exportation des semences à l’étranger peut poser également son lot de contraintes. Nous travaillons actuellement à trouver la solution idéale, afin de pouvoir faire voyager ROOTS le plus loin possible !</p>

Who's talking about ROOTS?
 

 

 
 
Why we created ROOTS?
 
The growth of the word population already poses space problems in most conventional cemeteries in many countries. In Japan, notably, even is cremation is obligatory, the vaults at maximum capacity force us to think of innovative solutions to how ashes are disposed.
Furthermore, traditional funeral rites are being singled out because of their negative impact on the environment. A 10 acre cemetery can contain 1,000 tons of metal, 20 000 tons of cement (vaults) enough wood from coffins to build 40 houses and the equivalence of an in-ground pool of toxic liquid used for embalming.
And in the end, everyone dreams of immortality. To leave his/her trace. To perpetuate life.
No more was required to create ROOTS!

Design
ROOTS pays tribute with beauty and elegance because of its sober and refined design.
With every extraordinary thing that we accomplish in life, why should we satisfy ourselves with a mediocre or ordinary product while it is possible to combine esthetics and ecology?
ROOTS is currently registered for the 11th edition of the GRANDS PRIX DU DESIGN, the most important design contest in Québec awarding the best creations in design.
 
Ecological
ROOTS, both made from post-consumer matter as well as entirely natural materials is certified by the Green Burial Council as a green funeral product. That makes us extremely proud!
The Green Burial Council is the environmental certification organization setting the standard for green burial in North America.


The fertiliser stick that is provided, combined with the new material made of coffee and lime that we created, will neutralise the high pH levels of the ashes and encourage the growth of the tree once planted.
The use of post-consumer coffee grounds honours the sustainable development values of our company. Furthermore, its reutilisation is highly symbolic of the cycle of life.
A tree that really grows!Each ROOTS urn will contain 3 different species of trees free of charge. Efficient!Our proven and highly effective planting system will allow for the inside planting of the tree in order to maximise its germination and growth. We even guarantee its germination (*certain conditions apply).This ensures that you have the possibility of starting the planting process regardless of the season and the time of death. Versatile!While we highly recommend starting the planting process of the tree inside, ROOTS can respond to many needs:
It could be planted directly in the ground
It could be used simply as an ecological urn for those who do not wish to grow a tree.
It could be buried separately from the tree. If you own a lot in a conventional cemetery, you can bury the urn there and plant the tree in another location that is significant to you.
  How it works The basic idea is to be able to feel the presence of the loved one in the important moments that we will live without him/her: the first celebration, first Christmas, first vacation, etc.Mourning is a difficult process and the hope created by the tree that is beginning to grow symbolizes life that continues.After a couple of months, when the tree is big enough, one can choose the appropriate moment to bury the urn and the tree in the ground.This way, the pace of the mourning process, which is different for each person, is respected. 
Team and R&DWith the help of a highly talented professional team, including industrial designers and a teacher-researcher who holds a Ph.D in horticulture, we worked on developing ROOTS for close to two years.During the research and development phase, close to one hundred natural and safe materials have been tested in order to ensure the growth of a tree. These materials were chosen because of their capacity for biodegradability and their strength. Many horticultural research projects were developed and many plans elaborated to ultimately create the sober, clean and functional design of this urn.    We have invested time, energy and money to develop the best possible product, one that brings together design, sustainable development and an efficient and versatile planting system. We truly believe that we have succeeded, besides the fact that we greatly enjoyed this journey! Our story … and that of RootsThe seed had been planted for a long time!This project is part of phase 2 of our company, Muses Design Urns, which already sells contemporary funeral urns made in cooperation with artists/designers.The original sparkle ignited when my father-in-law died, almost 20 years ago. No funeral product could truly suit his unique, inspiring and original personality! Therefore, we decided to have one of his cabinetmaker friends build a gorgeous urn. Jacques also has a tree planted in the country making his presence felt with us whenever we go.There you have it! Jacques’ urn and tree are behind ROOTS ! PartnersThank you to our financial partners without whom the research and development would not have led to this much innovation! Collaborators Why encourage us and to what purpose your financing will be used For a small business, launching a new product can be very costly, especially when a lot of money has already been invested in R&D. To be able to bring ROOTS to markets, we need you. You are our dragons!Investing in our crowdfunding campaign means participating in a great business endeavour. Moreover, you will not only be contributing personally, but you will also join a collective effort to transform our cemeteries into forests.In order to start the production of Roots, which will be totally local in order to respect the very essence of the product and the sustainable development value that is dear to Muses Design Urns, we need $15,000. This amount will allow us, among other things, to purchase the moulds to launch the first production of this new product and bring it to the market. Our social involvement  On top of valuing sustainable development and local as well as fair trade, Muses Design Urns strongly believes in social involvement.Since we want to give back to our community, the 10 first ROOTS urns will be donated to the J’Allume une étoile Foundation. They will be for families who have lost a baby.Muses also gives the equivalent of 1% of its sales to families in need by giving them urns for free. Timeline CounterpartsThe more you give, the more you receive.See of rewards description below.  Risks and challenges Every new project has its challenges. Even more so if we develop a new product and create a new material!If you have any questions, we will gladly answer them. You can contact us at info@musesdesign.comMoulding of coffee and limeThe material we have developed is optimal for the growth of a tree, but it is very difficult to mould. We worked all summer long to finalize the recipe and the moulding process. We had the support of the Centre de transfert technologique en écologie industrielle in Sorel for advice. The use of metal moulds for the production was obvious in order to provide a high-quality product with a standardized production.Layering the seeds We faced other challenges for the seeds. Before planting indoors, the seeds used cannot be in dormancy. Therefore we need to either:
pick a tree whose seeds are not in dormancy
ask the supplier to break dormancy (in which case the seeds have to be planted right away)
break dormancy at home (certain seeds need up to 90 days of layering in the fridge). Not very useful for our purposes …!
We chose a seed that is not dormant in order to facilitate fast sprouting and planting in any season. For the time being, the selection is narrow, but we continue our research.Exporting seeds abroad is also challenging. We are working to find the best solution, in order to allow Roots to travel as far as possible. Thank you!Thanks to our supporters and contributors. Your participation is important and greatly appreciated! Share!Whether you are a financial partner or not, you can always help us by sharing our project with your networks. That is what social media platforms are for!Talk about it to your friends and family.Obviously, sharing a funeral product is not as appealing as a video about cats, but you could write something like: “I don’t plan on dying anytime soon, I am not ready to become a tree just yet, but I do support the birth of an innovative project: ROOTS .” VERSION FRANÇAISE
 
PRÉSENTATION DU PROJET
 
Notre mission est simple : offrir la plus belle et innovante urne funéraire écologique qui se transforme en arbre.
Que ce soit pour la naissance, un mariage ou pour ou un décès, planter un arbre est un hommage à la vie. C’est un geste symbolique qui consolide nos racines. Quelle belle façon écologique de perpétuer la vie !
Avec ROOTS :

Le cycle de la vie se renouvelle;
Les cimetières se transforment en forêt;
Le deuil est accompagné d’espoir et la mémoire devient une présence vivante;
Vous optez un produit écologique sans faire de compromis sur l’esthétique.

Qui parle de ROOTS ?
 


 

Pourquoi avoir créé ROOTS ?

 
La croissance de la population mondiale pose déjà un problème d’espace dans les cimetières conventionnels, et ce dans plusieurs pays. Au Japon, en autres, même si la crémation est obligatoire, les voutes au maximum de leur capacité nous obligent à réfléchir à des solutions innovatrices pour disposer des cendres.
D’autre part, les rites funéraires traditionnels sont de plus pointés du doigt en raison de leur impact négatif sur l’environnement. Un cimetière de 10 acres peut contenir 1 000 tonnes de métal, 20 000 tonnes de béton (voûtes), assez de bois provenant des cercueils pour construire 40 maisons et l’équivalent d’une piscine creusée en liquides toxiques servant à l’embaumement.
Et finalement, tout le monde rêve d’immortalité. De laisser sa trace. De perpétuer la vie.
Il n’en fallait pas plus pour créer ROOTS !

Design
ROOTS rend hommage avec beauté et élégance par son design sobre et épuré.
Avec tout ce que nous accomplissons d’extraordinaire dans la vie, pourquoi faudrait-il se contenter de produit médiocre ou ordinaire alors que c’est possible d’allier écologie et esthétisme?
ROOTS est actuellement inscrite à la 11e  édition des GRANDS PRIX DU DESIGN, le plus important concours québécois récompensant les meilleures réalisations en design.
 
Écologique
ROOTS, fabriquée à la fois de matière post-consommation et de matériaux entièrement naturels est certifiée produit funéraire vert par le Green Burial Council et nous en sommes très fiers !
Le Green Burial Council est l’organisme de certification environnementale qui établit les normes pour l’inhumation verte en Amérique du Nord.
 


Le bâtonnet d’engrais fourni combiné au nouveau matériau à base de café et chaux que nous avons inventé, permettront de neutraliser le pH élevé des cendres et de favoriser la croissance de l’arbre une fois en terre.
 
 L’utilisation de marc de café post consommation fait honneur aux valeurs de développement durable de notre entreprise. De plus, son réemploi est hautement symbolique du cycle de la vie.

Un arbre qui pousse vraiment !
Chaque urne ROOTS contiendra gracieusement 3 essences d’arbres différentes.
 
Efficace !
Notre système de plantation performant et éprouvé permet de débuter la plantation de l’arbre à l’intérieur afin de maximiser sa germination et sa croissance.
Nous garantissons même la germination.  (*certaines conditions s’appliquent)
De cette façon vous avec la possibilité débuter la plantation peu importe la saison ou le moment du décès.
 
Polyvalent !
Bien que nous suggérions fortement de débuter la plantation de l’arbre à l’intérieur, ROOTS peut répondre à différents besoins :

Elle pourrait être plantée directement en terre.
Elle pourrait être utilisée simplement comme urne écologique pour ceux qui ne veulent pas nécessairement faire pousser un arbre
Elle peut être inhumée séparément de l’arbre. Si vous avez un lot dans un cimetière conventionnel, vous pourriez inhumer l’urne au cimetière et planter l’arbre dans un endroit significatif pour vous.


 
Comment ça fonctionne
 
L’idée de départ est de pouvoir sentir la présence de l’être cher dans les premiers moments importants que nous vivrons sans lui; la première fête, le premier Noël, les premières vacances...
Le deuil est un processus difficile et l’espoir créer par l’arbre qui amorce sa croissance symbolise la vie continue.
 Après quelques mois, lorsque l’arbre est suffisamment grand, chacun peut choisir le moment propice pour aller mettre l’urne et l’arbre en terre.
On respecte ainsi le rythme du processus de deuil, qui est différent pour tous.


 
Équipe et R&D
 
Avec une équipe hautement talentueuse et professionnelle, incluant des designers industriels et une professeur-chercheure détenant un Ph.D en horticulture, nous avons travaillé pendant près de 2 ans au développement de ROOTS .

Au cours de la phase de recherche et développement, une centaine de matériaux naturels et inoffensifs assurant la bonne croissance d’un arbre ont été créés et testés, entre autres, pour leur rythme de biodégradabilité et leur solidité. Plusieurs recherches horticoles ont été conduites et que dire du nombre de plans qui ont été élaborés pour arriver au design sobre, épuré et fonctionnel de cette urne !
Nous avons investi temps, énergie et argent pour arriver à développer le meilleur produit possible qui allie design, développement durable et un système de plantation efficace et polyvalent. Nous croyons sincèrement avoir réussi et nous avons eu énormément de plaisir tout au long de cette aventure !

 

Notre Histoire… et celle de ROOTS
 
Il y a longtemps que cette idée germe !
Ce projet s’inscrit en fait dans la 2e phase de notre entreprise, Muses Urnes Design, qui propose déjà des urnes funéraires contemporaines produites en collaboration avec des artistes/designers. 
Le désir de créer cette entreprise, au départ, faisait suite au décès de mon beau-père il y presque 20 ans. Aucun produit funéraire ne pouvait représenter sa personnalité unique, inspirante et anticonformiste! Nous avons donc fait fabriquer une urne magnifique par un de ses amis ébénistes. Jacques a aussi son arbre hommage à la campagne qui nous permet de sentir sa présence quand nous y allons. 
Voilà ! L’urne et l’arbre de Jacques sont à l’origine de ROOTS !

 
Partenaires 

Merci à nos partenaires financiers sans qui la recherche et développement n’aurait pas permis tant d’innovation !

Pourquoi nous encourager
et à quoi servira le financement
 
Le lancement d’un nouveau produit pour une petite entreprise peut s’avérer très couteux, surtout quand des sommes considérables ont été investies dans la R&D. Pour arriver à mettre en marché ROOTS, nous avons besoin de vous. Vous êtes nos dragons !
Participer à notre campagne de socio financement, c’est participer à la réalisation d’une belle aventure entrepreneuriale. De plus, non seulement vous contribuerez personnellement, mais vous participerez collectivement à transformer les cimetières en forêt.
Pour lancer la production de ROOTS, qui sera entièrement locale afin de respecter l’essence du produit et les valeurs de développement durable de Muses Urnes Design, nous avons besoin de 15 000$ CAN. Cette somme permettra, entre autres, l’achat des moules pour lancer la première production et la mise en marché de ce nouveau produit.
 
Notre implication sociale
 
Au-delà des valeurs de développement durable et de commerce local et équitable, Muses Urnes Design croit beaucoup à l’implication sociale.
Et comme nous voulons redonner à la communauté, les 10 premières urnes ROOTS seront offertes à la Fondation J’allume une étoile. Elles seront destinées à des familles qui ont perdu un bébé.
Muses remet également l’équivalent de 1% de ses ventes en offrant gratuitement des urnes à des familles dans le besoin.

Risques et défis
 
Tout nouveau projet comporte des défis. Le développement d’un produit avec la création d’un nouveau matériau encore plus !
Si vous avez des questions, il nous fera plaisir d’y répondre. Vous pouvez nous rejoindre à info@musesdesign.com
Le moulage du café et de la chaux
Le matériau que nous avons créé est optimal pour la croissance de l’arbre, mais il est très difficile à mouler. Nous avons travaillé tout l’été à l’optimisation de la recette et des procédés de moulage. Nous avons eu recours aux conseils du Centre de transfert technologique en écologie industrielle de Sorel. L’utilisation des moules en métal pour la fabrication s’est imposée d’elle-même. Nous aurons ainsi un produit de haute qualité dont la production sera uniformisée.
Stratification des semences 
Autres défis du côté des semences. Afin de débuter la plantation à l’intérieur, les semences utilisées ne doivent pas être en dormance. Pour ce faire, il faut soit :

choisir des essences d’arbre dont les semences ne sont pas dormantes
faire lever la dormance par le fournisseur de semences (auquel cas elles doivent être semées immédiatement)
lever la dormance à la maison. (Certaines essences demandent jusqu’à 90 jours de stratification au réfrigérateur.) Pas très pratique pour notre concept… !

Nous avons donc opté pour des essences non dormantes afin de maximiser la germination rapide et la plantation, peu importe la saison. Pour l’instant la sélection relativement restreinte, mais nous poursuivons nos recherches.
L’exportation des semences à l’étranger peut poser également son lot de contraintes. Nous travaillons actuellement à trouver la solution idéale, afin de pouvoir faire voyager ROOTS le plus loin possible !

Que vous participiez financièrement ou non, vous pouvez toujours nous aider en partageant ce projet dans votre réseau. Les réseaux sociaux, c’est un peu fait pour ça !
Parlez-en à vos amis, votre famille.
C’est certain que partager des trucs funéraires ce n’est pas aussi mignon que les p’tits vidéos de chats, mais vous pourriez écrire : «Je n’ai pas l’intention de mourir bientôt, je ne suis pas prêt à devenir un arbre maintenant mais je supporte la naissance d’un projet innovateur qui prend racine : ROOTS ».",51.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Polly Alford, CEO and Founder of ReefCI.  After years of grinding it out with a large, multinational corporation, I followed my heart and relocated to Belize to open a conservation organization.  Selling my home and using my life's savings, I founded Reef Conservation International, ReefCI, a registered Belizean Non-Profit organization.  </p>
<p>An avid diver and PADI Instructor, I created a unique program in which ReefCI's multifaceted conservation efforts could be shared and experienced by everyone from professionals to students to tourists. </p>
<p>By exposing more people to the beauty of our oceans and reefs and educating them on the importance of keeping them healthy and alive, we are creating a strong community of advocates who will help insure the ocean and it's many creatures and inhabitants will continue to provide sustenance, income and enjoyment for generations to come.  </p>
<p>While ReefCI has many important initiatives, none in recent years is more critical than the eradication of the Lionfish. </p>
<p><b>The Lionfish invasion is arguably the worst marine disaster in history!</b> Not native to Caribbean waters, Lionfish were first spotted in Belize in 2009, and they have multiplied at frightening rates ever since.  They have no natural enemies and are systematically killing off key species of fish, crustaceans and coral.  </p>
<p>No other organization in Belize has done more to address the Lionfish problem than ReefCI.  </p>
<p><b>Unless we wish to face a natural disaster from which we can never recover, the extinction of fish species and the death of the second largest barrier reef in the world, we must expand our efforts now. </b> </p>
<p>Our needs are financial and without your support, we will be faced with the harsh reality of being unable to continue. With your support, we can go on.

<div>Lionfish are indigenous in the Indio Pacific oceans and the Red Sea but not the Atlantic-Caribbean belt.  In their natural environment, they have a diet that is not a threat, and they have natural predators.  However, In the Atlantic and Caribbean oceans, they are feeding on species that are key to our environment such as juvenile wrasse, parrotfish, and crustaceans.  Lionfish are voracious predators and can consume huge percentages of juvenile fish recruits.  And, they breed rapidly releasing around 20,000 eggs every 4 days!</div>
<div>Our coral reefs and oceans have an important role in the world economy and in world health. Over 42 million people make their living from the coral reefs primarily through fishing and tourism.  If the reef dies, what will happen?  Additionally, commercially important species will reduce or disappear making the price of fish skyrocket for everyone.  This could easily force fisherman out of business and create the need for millions of people to alter the way they eat and their primary sources of protein.  </div>
<div>But, it's not just the fishermen who are in danger.  With no fish or reef, there will be no divers and far fewer tourists.  Diving alone is a $2.1 billion business in the Caribbean.  Hotels, restaurants, dive operations, and other tourist attractions will close and local economies will tank.  </div>
<div>A single Lionfish may reduce the number of juvenile native fish on any given reef by approximately 79% in just 5 weeks!  Removing 20 Lionfish on a single dive equates to saving approximately 300,000 juvenile fish over a one-year period.  ReefCI, on average, removes 50 Lionfish on every dive, and we can multiply that with each diver we educate and teach to help.</div>
<div>Additionally, ReefCI has been instrumental in teaching local restaurants the value of putting Lionfish on the menu.  They are delicious and, by creating a demand for them as food, we can increase the desire of the fishing community to participate in our efforts.</div>
<div>ReefCI also works with local women who use the Lionfish spines to make beautiful jewelry.  ReefCI is helping empower them by creating a sustainable source of income.</div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I'm Polly Alford, CEO and Founder of ReefCI.  After years of grinding it out with a large, multinational corporation, I followed my heart and relocated to Belize to open a conservation organization.  Selling my home and using my life's savings, I founded Reef Conservation International, ReefCI, a registered Belizean Non-Profit organization.  
An avid diver and PADI Instructor, I created a unique program in which ReefCI's multifaceted conservation efforts could be shared and experienced by everyone from professionals to students to tourists. 
By exposing more people to the beauty of our oceans and reefs and educating them on the importance of keeping them healthy and alive, we are creating a strong community of advocates who will help insure the ocean and it's many creatures and inhabitants will continue to provide sustenance, income and enjoyment for generations to come.  
While ReefCI has many important initiatives, none in recent years is more critical than the eradication of the Lionfish. 
The Lionfish invasion is arguably the worst marine disaster in history! Not native to Caribbean waters, Lionfish were first spotted in Belize in 2009, and they have multiplied at frightening rates ever since.  They have no natural enemies and are systematically killing off key species of fish, crustaceans and coral.  
No other organization in Belize has done more to address the Lionfish problem than ReefCI.  
Unless we wish to face a natural disaster from which we can never recover, the extinction of fish species and the death of the second largest barrier reef in the world, we must expand our efforts now.  
Our needs are financial and without your support, we will be faced with the harsh reality of being unable to continue. With your support, we can go on. We can educate more people and expand the efforts in Belize and other parts of the Caribbean and the United States.  With your support, we will save the beautiful ocean and reef for our children and their children and the generations beyond.     What We Need & What You Get The number one expense for ReefCI is the maintenance and running of our boats.  Fuel is very pricey and our engines are old and inefficient.
To replace the old engines with new, fuel and energy efficient 4-stroke 250 Yamaha's, we need to raise $50,000 US.  Reaching this level of funding will be sufficient to allow us to continue our efforts in a manner similar to what we are doing today.

If we do not reach our goal of $50,000 or more, we will use whatever funds we have to replace an engine at a time and continue to look for ways to operate in the bootstrapping method we've always employed.  We will do this, but time is of the essence and the Lionfish problem is growing rapidly.  Please consider helping us move more quickly by giving today.

 Other Ways You Can Help

While our primary needs are financial, if you cannot afford to give, there are other ways you can help.  
First, develop a passion for our oceans and coral reefs.  Educate yourself on their importance and enjoy the beauty and vitality.
Second, take that passion and turn it into action!  Tell your family, friends and contacts about the marine disaster accelerating in the Atlantic-Caribbean basin and ask them to help.  Post the link to our Indiegogo site on your personal social media pages and help us spread the word and expand our community of supporters.

   Milieu,
intervention et conservation!



UQAMAZONE c'est 20 étudiants de maitrise et doctorat en sciences de          l'environnement qui participent à un cours de terrain en Amazonie.

	
		
		
	
	
		






Ce cours intensif se déroulera durant un séjour de deux semaines (fin août – début
septembre) en Amazonie brésilienne, tant en milieu rural (vallées de la rivière
Tapajós et du fleuve Amazone) qu’à Belém (rencontres avec des représentants de
grandes institutions amazoniennes œuvrant en recherche, en intervention et en
planification).






L'objectif est de dresser un portrait global des
problématiques sociales et environnementales de ce milieu. En plus des professeurs
québécois et brésiliens, plusieurs personnes ressources œuvrant en Amazonie
interviendront durant le cours.





De nombreuses
rencontres sont également prévues avec des représentants des populations
riveraines de l’Amazone et du Tapajós (agriculteurs et pêcheurs).

						
			

Ce projet nous tient à coeur puisqu'il nous permettra de: 






Comprendre le fonctionnement des écosystèmes amazoniens.






Comprendre les enjeux sociaux en relation avec le besoin de concilier la conservation et le
développement de cet environnement.




En plus de favoriser les échanges culturels et intellectuels entre les étudiants québécois et brésiliens.

	





Votre contribution ainsi que votre support nous sont d'une grande aide pour concrétiser ce voyage!









Pourquoi devons nous débourser et ce que vous obtenez en soutenant notre financement
Bien que nous ayons déjà fait plusieurs activités de financement durant la dernière année (vente de café bio-équitable, emballage en épicerie, nettoyage des rues après la F1 de Montréal, soirée brésilienne, cocktail de Noël) nous n'avons toujours pas atteint les 40 000$ nécessaires à la réalisation de ce voyage. Le montant du financement dont nous avons besoin sert à :
Payer les frais du bateau.
Payer l'équipage.
Acheter de la nourriture et de l'eau potable.
Se procurer des médicaments en cas de besoin.
Nous déplacer en Amazonie

Nous avons développé une manière intéressante de nous financer en vous faisant participer à notre voyage!   

Pour 10$ nous vous enverrons une carte postale virtuelle du groupe en action en Amazonie.
Pour 20$, un participant vous remettra une paire de boucles d'oreille achetée au Brésil. 


 Mettez-nous au défi!
Mais pour 40$, vous et vos amiEs pouvez lancer, à l'ensemble du groupe ou à un des participantEs en particulier, un défi en Amazonie qui sera capturé en photo puis envoyé à votre adresse courriel.
Enfin pour 100$ nous vous ferons parvenir 3 photos encadrées sur les problématiques environnementales étudiées en Amazonie. À moins que vous ne préféreriez  recevoir 3 photos encadrées de 3 défis que vous nous aurez lancé?

In landfills, this food waste breaks down into methane, a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to climate change. At the same time, to fertilize soil that has lost its nutrients, Americans add millions of tons of fertilizer. While there are many exciting solutions to these systemic problems, <b>Good Turn Earth Company is focused on converting food waste</b> -- captured from supermarkets, restaurants and households -- <b>into a soil amendment that helps create healthier, living soil, </b></span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>naturally.</b></i>

<p>Good Turn Earth Company is already making a difference!  In <b>just a couple of short months </b>we have developed partnerships with local businesses, diverted <b>over 4 tons of greenwaste</b> from the landfill, helped the city process several tons of dried fall leaves, and built our first waste processing ""bins"" right in Fredericksburg. </p>
<p>We are creating a system that nurtures life from waste, and inviting the whole
community to participate. Compost bins will be available at the
downtown farmer's market each week and there will be a drop off site for locals
to bring their coffee grounds and food scraps that would otherwise end up in a
landfill.  Good Turn is pioneering a new
way for the Fredericksburg area community to collaborate and do a good turn for
the planet. </p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>We've already overcome many of the initial challenges: we've built partnerships with one of the largest supermarkets and coffee shops of Fredericksburg, who are both excited about what we do; we've found a values-aligned partner in <a href=""http://downtowngreens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://downtowngreens.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Downtown Greens, Inc</a>., an urban greenspace who has provided the space to compost our first round of materials; we've built a relationship with the city to be able to store and process leaves collected during the fall; and we've found distributors willing to host and sell our final product.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges ahead will be in generating sales for the soil amendment, which will be costlier and much healthier than chemical fertilizers. This will require consumer education about the importance of living soil for the health of our planet, ourselves, our farms, and our food. Given that our team brings experience in environmental education and business development and given that our distribution partners are committed to helping get the word out to their customers, we are in a great place to launch.<b> This campaign -- and each one of you -- will be a huge help in getting the word out about our incredible mission and product.</b></p>

The local start-up is committed to rescuing green waste from the landfill and transforming it into a living, breathing soil conditioner that produces strong and healthy plants.

Our team first met in September 2014 where we were finalists
in the Start-Up Weekend Competition in Fredericksburg, Virginia.  Later that fall we took honors at the Made in
FredVa competition sponsored by the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce.  Our team has grown to include partners bringing diverse experience -- in farms and gardens, start-ups, family businesses, and non-profits -- all with a shared commitment to tackling waste, improving the food system, and creating local jobs.


We didn't hesitate to get started: we got our hands dirty in all kinds of ways! We have already built strong local partnerships with key Fredericksburg institutions, including Wegmans grocery store, 25 30 Espresso, Earth Mother Mushrooms and Fredericksburg City Public
Works. We collect unsellable produce from Wegmans supermarket and coffee grounds from the coffee shops every Saturday, and have been storing literally tons of leaves from the city fall cleanups. Good Turn Earth Co. is producing a gourmet mix composed of city leaves,
coffee grounds, out-of-date produce, mushroom compost and worm castings that
will recondition and revitalize local soil.


We love the
Fredericksburg community and want to see it flourish! Our premium organic soil conditioner will
be sold in downtown Fredericksburg at the Farmer’s Market and Roxbury Farm and
Garden Center and in Spotsylvania at Harvest Market and Courtland Ace Hardware.
To get these products to market, we need your help! Our campaign will help Good Turn Earth Co. grow, processing our first set of soil conditioner in spring 2015, bagging, distributing and selling the first 5 tons of compost; building new partnerships with other city businesses; launching collection of food waste at local farmer's markets; and scaling up our processing to be able to handle more of Fredericksburg's food waste.   What We Need & What You Get So far, we've been bootstrapping. Together, we've built composting systems from scratch, with chicken wire, tarps and a lot of hard work by all of us, friends, and family.

With this campaign, we are raising $11,500 to be able to register and launch the business officially, build the equipment we need to finish processing our materials, distribute the first set of our soil amendment, and begin collecting food waste from consumers at farmer's markets. Here's the breakdown:
$2,000 professional services including attorneys, licensing, registration fees, insurance
$1,500 launching farmers market food waste collection, including farmers market fees, bins, education materials 
$3,000 tools for sifting final compost, essential supplies, and other equipment
$5,000 first run of packaging, including plastic free burlap bags, marketing, web services, and our video production
We know that this goal is ambitious but achievable -- with your help! Since we can't do this without you, we've put together an amazing combination of perks and rewards for different funding levels. Any level of funding will receive something from us in gratitude! 
Here's an example of some of the goodies we have for funders



At our entry levels, we'll send you a signed postcard to the team ($10) or a magnet with original artwork by Lindsay Coffman reminding you and your family or roommates about what can be composted ($25) We're making great Good Turn tote bags and t-shirts for the next levels, so you can show your support and look amazing! For the first 50 early birds, you can get a bag of our first round of compost (plus a t-shirt, tote bag, magnet and postcard) for only $65! After that, it'll go up to $75! Thanks to our incredible partnerships with Earth Mother Mushrooms, donors of $100+ will get their own tabletop oyster mushroom kit. Local FXBG artists have pitched in too: you can get your hands on a famous Dan Finnegan piece -- small and large planters for growing herbs or flowers! Bill Harris has offered to do a line drawing of one lucky donor's house, and David Wold has hand-turned a wooden compost bucket, etched with the city of Fredericksburg's  skyline! These are truly unique pieces, available only for supporters of Good Turn during this IndieGoGo campaign!(scroll down to see images for each level of funding)




The Impact


According to the USDA and the National Resources Defense Council, more than 40 percent of all food grown and distributed in the US is thrown away, somewhere between the farm and our forks. For fruits and vegetables, this is even higher -- more than 50 percent ends up wasted. In landfills, this food waste breaks down into methane, a potent greenhouse gas, contributing to climate change. At the same time, to fertilize soil that has lost its nutrients, Americans add millions of tons of fertilizer. While there are many exciting solutions to these systemic problems, Good Turn Earth Company is focused on converting food waste -- captured from supermarkets, restaurants and households -- into a soil amendment that helps create healthier, living soil, naturally.





Good Turn Earth Company is already making a difference!  In just a couple of short months we have developed partnerships with local businesses, diverted over 4 tons of greenwaste from the landfill, helped the city process several tons of dried fall leaves, and built our first waste processing ""bins"" right in Fredericksburg. 
We are creating a system that nurtures life from waste, and inviting the whole
community to participate. Compost bins will be available at the
downtown farmer's market each week and there will be a drop off site for locals
to bring their coffee grounds and food scraps that would otherwise end up in a
landfill.  Good Turn is pioneering a new
way for the Fredericksburg area community to collaborate and do a good turn for
the planet. 
   Risks & Challenges
 

We've already overcome many of the initial challenges: we've built partnerships with one of the largest supermarkets and coffee shops of Fredericksburg, who are both excited about what we do; we've found a values-aligned partner in Downtown Greens, Inc., an urban greenspace who has provided the space to compost our first round of materials; we've built a relationship with the city to be able to store and process leaves collected during the fall; and we've found distributors willing to host and sell our final product.
The biggest challenges ahead will be in generating sales for the soil amendment, which will be costlier and much healthier than chemical fertilizers. This will require consumer education about the importance of living soil for the health of our planet, ourselves, our farms, and our food. Given that our team brings experience in environmental education and business development and given that our distribution partners are committed to helping get the word out to their customers, we are in a great place to launch. This campaign -- and each one of you -- will be a huge help in getting the word out about our incredible mission and product.

<h2>4 Resort<br/>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Myanmar Hideout Villa Residence Resort <br/></p>
<p>Today, the modern industrial society is characterised by an increasing range of services, efficiency, increase profitability, overstimulation and customer world development. Back in the day this behaviour seemed desirable. But nowadays we feel stressed and even suffer from burn-out. Society is seeking a spot for rest and recreation, with a sufficient distance between holiday and daily life to recharge our body’s batteries. A symbiosis of nature and culture with opportunities to practice sports and to socialise with others is preferable.</p>
<p>The resort “Myanmar Hideout” is pursuing the same aim: A place for holiday makers, far from industry and big cities, with endless, lonely beaches, local exotic dishes and specialties prepared by the Islanders; getting to know Myanmar’s nature and culture.<br/></p>
<h3>Residences</h3>
<p>Designed to blend in with the rich nature that surrounds it, the 20 cabins sit on the hill with views of the ocean. The cottages are predominantly constructed from natural materials in a modern, clear design with indigenous touch. They intend to present a private retreat in order to create space for quiet and concentration. Each cabin is equipped with a bathroom, a terrace, deckchairs and a comfortable covered lounge. <br/></p>
<h3>Restaurant and Bar</h3>
<p>There will be two restaurants on the premises. The international restaurant is connected to a bar. Guests can order international, vegetarian and vegan dishes.</p>
<p>The second restaurant, a Burmese style cuisine, has exclusively local chefs. Guests can experience the traditional cuisine of the country. The atmosphere and operating concept follows the habits of the local people.</p>
<p>On demand we offer special detox programs to purify the body.<br/></p>
<h3>Nutrition Advice and Cooking<br/>
</h3>
<p>A balanced state of nutritional, physical and mental health play an increasingly important role in our life. Brainwashed marketing strategies like processed food are quick to prepare but damage our body. Our nutritional advice class provides good knowledge about individual characteristics of nature products in order to ensure a healthy living.<br/></p>
<h3>Yoga and Meditation<br/>
</h3>
<p>Join daily yoga classes in a peaceful ambience surrounded by palmtrees. Take the dynamic class in the early morning for an active start into the day or join us for a restorative class in the evening to finish the day with peace and harmony. We offer dynamic styles like Vinyasa Flow and restorative classes like Yin Yoga for everybody. Be open for other steps in Yoga like Pranayama and Meditation to calm your mind.<br/>During off-peak seasons we organize Yoga Teacher Trainings.<br/></p>
<h3>Massage<br/>
</h3>
<p>Three types of massage will be offered:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Thai massage</li>
<li>Ayurvedic massage</li>
<li>Shiatsu massage</li>
</ul>
<h3>Water Shiatsu</h3>
<p>Water shiatsu (Watsu) is an innovative method of relaxation. There is no active participation. In Watsu the guest slides through the water by a trainer. The goal of this method is primal emotion of security, harmonising, stimulationand healing for inner harmony.<br/>Due to movement and the massage a muscle relaxation finds place. Organs get strengthens, flexibility gets trained and it expands the joints. It will enable your life energy to flow freely again.</p>

<br/>
<h3>Sailing, Kayaking, Stand up Paddling, Boat trips<br/>
</h3>
<p>Kayaks are provided for exploring the nearby areas. Guests with a valid sailing license can get their own small boats to explore the surrounding themselves. Moreover, it is worth considering combining the cooperation of regional fisher man from different villages to join tourists on the daily fishing trips. Furthermore boat trips to the Moken (sea gipsys) and remote islands are offered. In this way guests get offered a wide range of ways to discover the archipelago.<br/></p>
<h3>Scuba Diving and Snorkelling</h3>
<p>We will have trips for beginner and intermediate class where our guests 
can explore the beautiful flora and fauna of the tropical sea; e.g. 
elephant manta rays, majestic whale sharks and the colourful corals for 
makro-lovers.<br/>
The remote location, unique underwater world and the significant 
biodiversity will provide an adventurous diving experience. Due to 
location and limited boat access the spots won’t be filled with mass 
tourists.</p>

<br/><h3>The Country</h3>
<p>Myanmar lies in South-East Asia bordering Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. From north to the south it’s 2.500 km and approximately 900 km from east to west. Myanmar is double the size of Germany.<br/>Yangon is the economical and cultural centre where the foreign embassies are located and has a population of 6.5 million. Naypyidaw is where the parliament is located and in 2005, became the capital city.<br/>Myanmar has a population of 59 million from over 135 different ethnic groups. The main religion is Buddhism with 89% (Christian 5%, Muslim 4%, Hinduism and Animism 1%).<br/>Due to economic sanctions because of a predominantly military regime, the country couldn’t be reached from the outside at all until 2012.<br/>It is only now that the country is becoming more open for tourists.<br/></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>The resort will be located in south east Myanmar on Mergui Archipelago. Burmese name: မြိတ်ကျွန်းစု), Coordinates: 11°08’49.2″North 98°16’58.8″East. Area of 36.000 km2. The archipelago starts at the border of Thailand and spreads 450 km up north and 160 km west to the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean). It consists more than 800 beautiful tropical islands made from limestone and granite. The climate is tropical with high humidity. The rain season is from mid May to mid of October. Biotope to rare wildlife. Gorgeous coral reefs, white sand beaches &amp; jungle.</p>
<blockquote><p>The UNO classified the south-east Asian Coral Triangle as having the largest population of coral and fish species on the whole planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>This area is inhabited by the Moken, in other words sea gypsies or nomads of the ocean. Last pristine paradise on Earth. A real hideout to feel pure nature.</p>
<p>Especially the south is still unexplored by tourists.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Arrival</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<b>→ Yangon → Kawthaung</b><br/>Myanmar is increasingly interesting as a travel destination, therefore more and more airlines have started having stopovers at Myanmar’s international airport Yangon or in Mandalay. There are domestic flights from Yangon to Kawthaung, where our resort guests will get picked up by our boat.</li>
<li>
<b>→ Bangkok → Ranong/Kawthaung</b><br/>Alternatively the route via Bangkok (Thailand) can be chosen. A domestic flight from Bangkok to Ranong takes only 50 minutes. From there it’s a small step with a ferry to our pick up location in Kawthaung (Myanmar).<br/>

4 Resort

Philosophy
Myanmar Hideout Villa Residence Resort 
Today, the modern industrial society is characterised by an increasing range of services, efficiency, increase profitability, overstimulation and customer world development. Back in the day this behaviour seemed desirable. But nowadays we feel stressed and even suffer from burn-out. Society is seeking a spot for rest and recreation, with a sufficient distance between holiday and daily life to recharge our body’s batteries. A symbiosis of nature and culture with opportunities to practice sports and to socialise with others is preferable.
The resort “Myanmar Hideout” is pursuing the same aim: A place for holiday makers, far from industry and big cities, with endless, lonely beaches, local exotic dishes and specialties prepared by the Islanders; getting to know Myanmar’s nature and culture.
Residences
Designed to blend in with the rich nature that surrounds it, the 20 cabins sit on the hill with views of the ocean. The cottages are predominantly constructed from natural materials in a modern, clear design with indigenous touch. They intend to present a private retreat in order to create space for quiet and concentration. Each cabin is equipped with a bathroom, a terrace, deckchairs and a comfortable covered lounge. 
Restaurant and Bar
There will be two restaurants on the premises. The international restaurant is connected to a bar. Guests can order international, vegetarian and vegan dishes.
The second restaurant, a Burmese style cuisine, has exclusively local chefs. Guests can experience the traditional cuisine of the country. The atmosphere and operating concept follows the habits of the local people.
On demand we offer special detox programs to purify the body.
Nutrition Advice and Cooking

A balanced state of nutritional, physical and mental health play an increasingly important role in our life. Brainwashed marketing strategies like processed food are quick to prepare but damage our body. Our nutritional advice class provides good knowledge about individual characteristics of nature products in order to ensure a healthy living.
Yoga and Meditation

Join daily yoga classes in a peaceful ambience surrounded by palmtrees. Take the dynamic class in the early morning for an active start into the day or join us for a restorative class in the evening to finish the day with peace and harmony. We offer dynamic styles like Vinyasa Flow and restorative classes like Yin Yoga for everybody. Be open for other steps in Yoga like Pranayama and Meditation to calm your mind.During off-peak seasons we organize Yoga Teacher Trainings.
Massage

Three types of massage will be offered:

Thai massage
Ayurvedic massage
Shiatsu massage

Water Shiatsu
Water shiatsu (Watsu) is an innovative method of relaxation. There is no active participation. In Watsu the guest slides through the water by a trainer. The goal of this method is primal emotion of security, harmonising, stimulationand healing for inner harmony.Due to movement and the massage a muscle relaxation finds place. Organs get strengthens, flexibility gets trained and it expands the joints. It will enable your life energy to flow freely again.



Sailing, Kayaking, Stand up Paddling, Boat trips

Kayaks are provided for exploring the nearby areas. Guests with a valid sailing license can get their own small boats to explore the surrounding themselves. Moreover, it is worth considering combining the cooperation of regional fisher man from different villages to join tourists on the daily fishing trips. Furthermore boat trips to the Moken (sea gipsys) and remote islands are offered. In this way guests get offered a wide range of ways to discover the archipelago.
Scuba Diving and Snorkelling
We will have trips for beginner and intermediate class where our guests 
can explore the beautiful flora and fauna of the tropical sea; e.g. 
elephant manta rays, majestic whale sharks and the colourful corals for 
makro-lovers.
The remote location, unique underwater world and the significant 
biodiversity will provide an adventurous diving experience. Due to 
location and limited boat access the spots won’t be filled with mass 
tourists.

5 Myanmar



The Country
Myanmar lies in South-East Asia bordering Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. From north to the south it’s 2.500 km and approximately 900 km from east to west. Myanmar is double the size of Germany.Yangon is the economical and cultural centre where the foreign embassies are located and has a population of 6.5 million. Naypyidaw is where the parliament is located and in 2005, became the capital city.Myanmar has a population of 59 million from over 135 different ethnic groups. The main religion is Buddhism with 89% (Christian 5%, Muslim 4%, Hinduism and Animism 1%).Due to economic sanctions because of a predominantly military regime, the country couldn’t be reached from the outside at all until 2012.It is only now that the country is becoming more open for tourists.


To get a feeling how Myanmar looks like, try these films:

Especially the south is still unexplored by tourists.


Arrival


→ Yangon → KawthaungMyanmar is increasingly interesting as a travel destination, therefore more and more airlines have started having stopovers at Myanmar’s international airport Yangon or in Mandalay. There are domestic flights from Yangon to Kawthaung, where our resort guests will get picked up by our boat.

→ Bangkok → Ranong/KawthaungAlternatively the route via Bangkok (Thailand) can be chosen. A domestic flight from Bangkok to Ranong takes only 50 minutes. From there it’s a small step with a ferry to our pick up location in Kawthaung (Myanmar).",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Our Story

Hi, We are a group of children ages 5-17
who have teamed up with the Williams Community Forest Project to save the
forest in the heart of our town from a devastating 320 acre clear-cut.  This pristine forest  is part of a major corridor for animal migration,
and home to numerous endangered and threatened species such as the Red Tree
Vole, Pacific Fisher, Mariposa Lily and Northern Spotted Owl. It contains the headwaters for three of our
creeks which provide the people and farms of the Williams Valley with some of
the cleanest drinking and irrigation water in the nation.  Because this land is privately owned, it is
within the owners right to clear-cut the trees and spray noxious, cancer
causing herbicides afterward which will wash down these creeks.. These are the
same creeks which flow through our homes and provide irrigation water to our
many organic farms.  We play in these
creeks in the summer. We have decided to buy this land and turn it into a community forest
which will be protected by the Williams Community Forest Project in perpetuity
and preserved as a Community Forest to be used by all. It will be managed
ecologically and sustainably to support and enrich our local and global forest
ecology and community. We have already raised over $120,000 towards
the $500,000 we need to secure a million dollar low interest loan and buy the
land.



The Impact

If
this campaign is not successful, the consequences are devastating.  A clearcut of this magnitude would have a
disastrous effect on our local environment and economy. It would affect the
entire watershed by destroying important habitat, causing massive erosion, and
most likely  poisoning our water with
herbicides.
 .
With
your help, we plan to prevent this 
clearcut by purchasing this land to secure it's future for present and
future generations. We envision a forest maintained for the benefit of our local
ecology and community. This community forest will provide rich educational and
recreational opportunities and serve as a model for sustainable forest
management.  



What We Need & What You Get
The owner has already begun clearcutting this land!  We need to raise $500,000 in order to protect what is left. We have already raised $120,000. That means we need to raise
$350,000 more dollars. We are pursuing many avenues of funding including

What I aim to do with my degree is basically to construct large metropolises with the health of the planet in mind. I want to be able to satiate the public's desire to live in the city while also creating little to no harmful effects on the environment. In fact, I want to be able to create a city that actually is beneficial to the land and promotes biodiversity in plants as well as animals.

As seen all over the world, there is a huge gap between the wealthy and the unemployed working class and, unfortunately, it is widening every day.

To be able to go to another country and offer aid to those who may not have the ability to help themselves means everything. So much is readily available for us which depletes its true worth and allows us to forget how fortunate we are. These basic necessities must be available to everyone. This program will also be focusing on the impact that our efforts will have on the environment. We must use Earth-friendly means as we provide these necessities to the people of Brazil. Sustainability is a constant partnership with human rights because we cannot obtain happiness of the people without being mindful towards the health of the planet and vice versa.

The first hurdle that I am attempting to tackle is my actual presence in Brazil where I will be applying my efforts and those of the people I will be working with. </p><p>Second, contributions will also go towards my education. Since this is a program provided by Arizona State University, I will also be attending classes in Brazil. Much of this class will be interactive which requires funding, both for the holding of the class and everything we will be doing outside of the classroom. We will not be going to this country blind. This class will help prepare us for anything we may encounter and give us the knowledge we need in order to lessen the wage gap experienced by many in Brazil. Funding is necessary and needed as I prepare to take an upper level college course in another country that will equip me with everything I need to know in order to provide these rights to the people as well as the environment. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>I Am Not a Robot, I Promise:</h3><p>This program means everything to me and will be the crowning achievement of my educational career. By choosing to aid me in my trip, you will not only allow me to do everything I have been aiming to do but you will also change the lives many living in poverty in Brazil. This program will not only give me the opportunity to help others living in different countries but will also satiate a small part of my incurable wanderlust. I feel a deep need to travel to as many places as I can and to be able to do that while also working with such a great program is truly an honor.  </p><p></p><p></p><h3>We Are Not Stopping Here:</h3><div>Even if another country is out of reach, we all still have power to help lessen the detrimental effects poverty has on the soul of a person. These efforts do not require much effort or even a large amount of time from one's schedule. The smallest of efforts can be made. These include anything from sharing our food to offering to water to volunteering at a soup kitchen. One is not required to travel to another country in order to help people. Poverty is right at the doorstep of everyone living in a city and requires the same amount of attention as anywhere else. </div><div>As far as the environment goes, the smallest of efforts are also appreciated and easily accumulate to a larger effect. We must be mindful of our waste and dispose of everything properly. If something is able to be reused, we must recycle it either within our own homes or at a proper plant. If our destination is relatively close, biking or walking is a beneficial alternative to driving a car.</div><div>Even the most average person can help alleviate poverty and support the environment. One does not have to be a huge granola hippie that doesn't own a home and lives off of a single bowl of rice everyday in order to care for the environment and the people around them. It is our duty as a person to care for those around us. It is our duty to ensure a safe future for our grandchildren where they will have access to clean water and food. It is our duty to be mindful of the effects that the actions performed today will have on tomorrow. It is our duty to be good people. Let's go get 'em, tiger. </div></div>","Marisa is Going to Brazil:My name is Marisa Noble and I am a Sustainability student at Arizona State University with a minor in Urban Planning.

Since this is a program provided by Arizona State University, I will also be attending classes in Brazil. Much of this class will be interactive which requires funding, both for the holding of the class and everything we will be doing outside of the classroom. We will not be going to this country blind. This class will help prepare us for anything we may encounter and give us the knowledge we need in order to lessen the wage gap experienced by many in Brazil. Funding is necessary and needed as I prepare to take an upper level college course in another country that will equip me with everything I need to know in order to provide these rights to the people as well as the environment. I Am Not a Robot, I Promise:This program means everything to me and will be the crowning achievement of my educational career. By choosing to aid me in my trip, you will not only allow me to do everything I have been aiming to do but you will also change the lives many living in poverty in Brazil. This program will not only give me the opportunity to help others living in different countries but will also satiate a small part of my incurable wanderlust. I feel a deep need to travel to as many places as I can and to be able to do that while also working with such a great program is truly an honor.  We Are Not Stopping Here:Even if another country is out of reach, we all still have power to help lessen the detrimental effects poverty has on the soul of a person. These efforts do not require much effort or even a large amount of time from one's schedule. The smallest of efforts can be made. These include anything from sharing our food to offering to water to volunteering at a soup kitchen. One is not required to travel to another country in order to help people. Poverty is right at the doorstep of everyone living in a city and requires the same amount of attention as anywhere else. As far as the environment goes, the smallest of efforts are also appreciated and easily accumulate to a larger effect. We must be mindful of our waste and dispose of everything properly. If something is able to be reused, we must recycle it either within our own homes or at a proper plant. If our destination is relatively close, biking or walking is a beneficial alternative to driving a car.Even the most average person can help alleviate poverty and support the environment. One does not have to be a huge granola hippie that doesn't own a home and lives off of a single bowl of rice everyday in order to care for the environment and the people around them. It is our duty as a person to care for those around us. It is our duty to ensure a safe future for our grandchildren where they will have access to clean water and food. It is our duty to be mindful of the effects that the actions performed today will have on tomorrow. It is our duty to be good people. Let's go get 'em, tiger.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers</h3>Mitakuye pi (relatives), we call on all those who honor the Creator and support the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmother’s work to please practice generosity for the upcoming 2014 Gathering, hosted by Oglala Lakota Grandmother and Council Member, Unci (Grandmother) Rita Long Visitor Holy Dance.  The event will take place September 4 - 7, 2014 in Spearfish, South Dakota, located in the ancestral lands of the Lakota Nation. <ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>WHO WE ARE &amp; OUR MISSION</h3> <p> We are the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers who came together for the first time in October, 2004, in Phoenicia, New York.  We gathered from the four directions on the sacred land of the Iroquois Confederacy.  We came from the rainforest of the Amazon, the Alaskan Tundra of North America, the great forests of the American Northwest, the vast plains of North America, the highlands of Central America, the Black Hills of South Dakota, the mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico, the desert of the American Southwest, the mountains of Tibet, and the rainforest of West Africa. <br/></p>
<p>We have been brought together by a common vision to form a new global alliance.  Our purpose is an alliance of prayer, education, and healing for our Mother Earth – for all Her inhabitants, for all children, and for the next seven generations.<br/></p>
<p>We are deeply concerned with the unprecedented destruction of our Mother Earth; the contamination of our air, waters, and soil; the atrocities of war; the global scourge of poverty and the violence globally; the threat of nuclear weapons and waste; the epidemics that threaten the health of all of life on Mother earth; the exploitation of indigenous medicines; and the destruction of indigenous ways of life.<br/></p>
<p>We come together to nurture, educate, and train our children.  We come together to uphold the practice of our ceremonies and affirm the right to use our plant medicines free of legal restrictions. We come together to protect the lands where our peoples live and upon which our cultures depend, to safeguard the collective heritage of traditional medicines, and to defend Mother Earth.  We believe that the teachings of our ancestors will light the way through these uncertain times.  </p>

Roseline a quatre enfants et habite à Dano, dans le Sud-Ouest du Burkina Faso. Chaque mois, alors qu’elle ne gagne que 75€, elle dépense 7,5€ pour acheter du bois pour cuisiner les repas et chauffer l’eau. Cette maman et le bébé qu’elle porte sur son dos sont exposés aux fumées de cuisson nocives au moins quatre heures par jour, quand elle cuisine. De plus, Roseline n’a pas accès à l’électricité ce qui, entre autres, empêche sa fille aînée de faire ses devoirs le soir. Les foyers améliorés et les lampes solaires pourraient aider Roseline et sa famille à vivre mieux et dépenser moins. Mais Roseline ne connait pas ces produits…
 
Roseline has four children and lives in Dano, in South-West Burkina Faso. Each month, even though she only earns $100, she spends $10 to buy firewood to cook meals and heat water. This mother and the baby she carries on her back are exposed to harmful cooking fumes at least four hours a day, when she cooks. In addition, Roseline has no access to electricity, which, among other things, prevents her eldest daughter to do her homework in the evening. Improved cookstoves and solar lamps could help Roseline and her family live better and spend less. But Roseline doesn’t know about these products ...

La Fondation L’OCCITANE

Depuis sa création en 1976, L’OCCITANE s’engage pour des actions d’intérêt général ayant un réel impact sur le terrain. En 2006, L’OCCITANE créée sa Fondation pour porter et rassembler ces initiatives.
La Fondation accompagne des projets qui couvrent 2 champs d’action : le soutien aux personnes déficientes visuelles, en France et dans le monde, et l’entrepreneuriat féminin au Burkina Faso, notamment à travers le renforcement des compétences de base (alphabétisation), l’apport de moyens financiers et techniques (microcrédit et formations) et la valorisation des actions entrepreneuriales (remise de prix). Depuis la création de la Fondation, 9 700 femmes ont bénéficié de ces programmes et plus de 500 000 personnes ont reçu des soins oculaires. 
La Fondation L’OCCITANE est partenaire de Nafa Naana depuis 2012.

Ever since its creation in 1976, L'OCCITANE has firmly supported actions to benefit the community that have a real impact on the ground. In 2006, L’OCCITANE created its Foundation to drive and bring together these initiatives. 
The L'OCCITANE Foundation is involved in projects in two fields of action: supporting the visually impaired in France and in the world, and promoting women entrepreneurship in Burkina Faso, thanks to the reinforcement of basic knowledge and skills (literacy), financial and technical resources (microcredits and trainings) and the promotion of entrepreneurial action (rewards).
Since the creation of the Foundation, 9,700 women benefited from these programs and more than 500,000 people received eye care.
The Foundation is a partner of Nafa Naana since 2012.

<p>We want to drive a car from England to Mongolia on 100% pure plant oil, eg. no fossil fuels.

<h3>What we need:</h3>
<p>For this project to succeed we need to get some funding. The most important things are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Car which will have to be prepared to drive on plant oil (approx. 3000£)</li>
<li>Plant oil for the car on the journey (approx. 1500£)</li>
<li>Insurance + maintainance for the car + visas (approx. 3000£)</li>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project will increase the knowledge of solutions and changes about the climate changes and the following global warming.</p>
<p>Climate changes are known throughout the whole existence of the earth, and we know of times where the earth was totally covered by ice, and of times where it was like a green house.</p>
<p>What makes climate changes to something special today is that they are caused by human actions.</p>
<p>It is the increasing amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere, which creates the changes in the weather, the meltdown of the ice caps and the increasing global temperature.</p>
<p>Therefore it is important to take a stand on these changes and accept, that something must be done in order for the earth to stay as it is today.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We ask not only for funding, but also publicity, we want to tell a story, and share our story.</p>
<p>We are also looking for spare parts for the car, and knowledge about alternative fuels, which we will be very happy to get as well.</p>
<p>We also need solar panels to charge our electrical equipment, for this we need solar panels end power converters.</p>

<p>Hello my name is Philippe, and I am a filmmaker. I have done more than 50 documentaries for BBC, 20th Century Fox, French TV, and Indie Productions.  I am experienced in video and sound production as well as post-production.   My wife Maxine has over 10 years of experience in the entertainment industry.  She has appeared as an actress on NYPD Blue and City of Angels, she is now a screenwriter.</p>
<p>We have become aware of a disaster going on in the Pacific Ocean: The Plastic Island floating twice the size of Texas. Well, in fact, it’s not an island floating. It’s worse than that. It is like a soup floating at different depth, with different size plastic.</p>
<p>This plastic right now is killing about a million birds worldwide every year, and 100,000 marine mammals. We are responsible for that, not only as a nation but as a human race. If we don't stop right now, we are going into a disaster. The plastic is releasing chemicals into the ocean and polluting our source of life. After doing research we estimate that the Pacific Patch is going to reach the West Coast of America in about 4 years....Then we will see hundreds of dolphins, sea lions and whales dead on our beaches...</p>
<p>It is time to radically change our habit with plastic worldwide.</p>
<p>That is why we are doing this documentary, and will translate it to as many languages as we possibly can to reach the entire population on earth.</p>
<p>It seems that when people see what is really going on, their common sense of survival makes them change, for the better, and for the betterment of future generations to come.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you will help us to achieve this goal of awareness worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need $50,000 to achieve this goal. $12,000 is going toward the video and sound equipment.  $20,000 is going towards the travel expenses (Plastic garbage sites: Hawaii big Island, Kauai, Atolls, Pacific Garbage Patch, Malaysia beaches), $4000 for the post-production, $1000 for the voice over, $8,000 for the online promotion worldwide to reach 1 million view worldwide the first month, and the rest in payment processing fees from this site.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, then we will still do the documentary with what we have. However, it will take much more time...</p>
<p>Everyone will still have his film copy or online digital copy, and you will be on the films credit roll as a contributor.   Remember, this film is going to be viewed by millions of people worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will make a huge difference. As a human race, we can have a chance to survive the future if everyone is aware of the damage we are creating. We have already wiped out hundreds of ocean wildlife species from our world forever. What is our heritage that we will leave to our kids, and the future generations? If we have a chance to do something about it, let's take it. Let's make the world aware!</p>

Our goal is to raise $2500 dollars by the end of our program, July 31st, for a summer of asking the fossil fuel industry to examine alternatives to the finite resources we depend on today. 
Why We're Doing What We're Doing


""Warming of 4°C can still be avoided: numerous studies show that there are techinically and economically feasible emissions pathways to hold warming likely below 2°C. Thus the level of impacts that developing countries and the rest of the world experience will be a result of government, private sector, and civil society decisions and choices, including, unfotunatley, inaction.""
From Turn Down the Heat: Why A 4°C World Must Be Avoided, put out by The World Bank in 2012.

Our world and life support system is changing fast! 
Global warming, increasing weather severity, escalating energy costs and energy security. This can start to feel a little overwhelming.

It really doesn't have to be overwhelming!
There are lots of small, simple but collectively effective things we can ALL do in our homes.

I want to try and change the way we view energy efficiency in the home. It does not need to be tedious, expensive and/or confusing to carry out effective energy efficiency measures. More often than not it only involves slight alterations to our lifestyles.
Start with the simple things and hopefully, use that as a springboard for the bigger bolder stuff!
My vision, is to create a social enterprise that produces simple, fun and affordable products that are used to help people make their homes more energy efficient. Helping people heal the planet and lower their bills!

 I have spent close to twenty years working in the environment, web and online-learning fields. Working on the largest government education web sites to the smallest of organisations and not-for-profits. 
In the last five years I have worked directly in the energy efficiency field. In that time I have met, interacted with and spoken to hundreds if not thousands of homeowners. I now have a clear idea of what is needed!
The general message is, most people want to do something but are often confused by what to do and more importantly where and how to start. There is a lot of information out there but it is often hard to find and can be contradictory and worse still, inaccurate.
What is needed is an affordable and dependable online guide, fact checked by industry experts.
We have the passion, knowledge and experience to develop this online interactive guide!
In my view there is no better time to get this easy to follow, online interactive guide out there! It is needed and in my opinion needs a little injection of fun in there too!

Have the ability to record a pledge (what you are going to try and achieve) 
The guide will act as a standalone ""paid for"" service which, will act as a revenue generator for future developments which, could include:

Smart phone app.
A full set of infographics based on the guide.
Children’s interactive eBook.
More in-depth residential energy efficiency guides. 
The guide will be available to ALL but could also be used for a subsidised** community driven scheme. For instance the guide could be backed up by a door to door community volunteer program with free give-away in addition to the guide.
**The guide could be subsidised/supported by organisations such as:

Insurance companies.
Property management companies.
Local government.
Energy related utilities.
Large corporate sponsors (in exchange for co-branding for instance)
Hardware stores.
Efficiency ""not for profits"" and Demand Side Management (DSM) companies who, could ""buy"" the energy savings for their programs.
There will also be an optional ""pledge system"". This will record what the user plans to do in an allotted time frame. This could be backed with a money back guarantee if the user doesn't save the cost equivalent of the guide!

It can, dare I say it… be fun!
""This saving energy thing and helping the planet does not have to involve you living in a cave!""
Think of it as a game or competition you can do with your entire family, friends and neighbours. Most of us like some healthy competition and it does not get much better than helping the planet and saving some money to boot. This could form part of a street/condo/apartment energy saving league table. Buy a cheap energy meter from your local hardware store and bask in your glory!

The guide will focus on the many small yet effective energy efficient measures you can carry out in the “standard home”. It will also cater to the  often overlooked apartment/condominium sector. Here are some of measures covered:

The use of CFL/LED lighting.
Small and large appliance best practice.
Power bars, timers and meters (smart or otherwise).
Motion sensing switches.
Faucet aerators, low flow shower-heads and hot water use. 
Thermostat and heating controls.
Energy efficient Christmas/Holidays add-ons.
Home office and multimedia equipment.
To name but a few!

The interactive guide also needs to be affordable for the those on tight budgets. Crowd funding on Indiegogo will allow that! My target is to produce this guide for under $25 per guide.
If we raise enough I would also like to take on extra personnel for the development phase and beyond.
Only you can make this project happen and give the planet a helping hand along the way!

http://projectnuevomundo.org/odyssey/
Our mission is To build an on-the-ground network and provide imperative, regenerative technology skills and labor and professional media and publicity to festivals, impact centers and communities in the United States, Mexico and Central America.

 
VisionImagine that there is an active Earth Odyssey on each continent, building self-sufficient homesteads and villages from the ground up while training and empowering passionate individuals to make their own dreams come true, traveling with intention and connecting to new projects and expanding the network's reach. We envision a world of all beings living in harmony with the ecosystem and
 creating transformational experiences for people to rekindle their 
tribal wisdom.

Short Summary

Earth Odyssey will leave a positive trace at nine impact centers and transformational festivals by providing skilled labor, professional media and publicity, and an array of workshops taught by our econauts to bring communities into living in balance with the planet. We will strengthen the network between these centers on the ground and online to increase their visibility by releasing 3-minute films throughout the journey.  Previous to enlisting in service to the Earth Odyssey, both buses on board have exceptional histories as vehicles for community service. Twenty econauts, two buses, and a mission to build a network of interlinked impact centers = a potent formula, ripe with the potential to catalyze a movement. We can do this, together.

What We Need 


To cover all of our expenses and to empower us to fully realize the mission we are embarking upon, we seek to raise $30 000 (We are asking $20 000 from our community as we are attempting to raise funds from other sources as well). The budget breaks down as follows:

What You Get
For rewards, we have an array of special offerings to thank our supporters, such as private classes with Econauts, media packages, life-changing and educational experiences facilitated by Project Nuevo Mundo, lots of beautiful hand-made souvenirs made with love by econauts, and memoirs of the journey!
You'll also get to join us in this growing network of intentional travelers who are making a difference in the world. Travel and develop your skills, find experiences, and arrive at beautiful new sites to join communities that will be so happy to have you and your gifts. You get your own story, written on your own network-- like a  LinkedIn and Wwoof crossover for your community that regrows the planet.



EarthcraftsThe Cobra BusThe Cobra Bus has been a fully functional mobile community for over five years, visiting and being of service to communities, transporting people cross-country and serving as a kitchen and dormitory in many different environments. The Blacksmith BusThe veggie-powered Blacksmith Bus has served as a mobile service for communities and individuals, creating useful tools from recycled steel.

<p></p></div>","Project: Green Settlement In this new
age, more and more people are starting to live  „with nature“ or „off grid“ as someone would
say, and this is the concept of this project. To show, how a community can
be built with just the materials provided by nature. This project is just
a bit more special, because its realization is led by an organization that
promotes the Fantasy genre and loves nature. So we want to create something
magical. Something people can enjoy, when they walk in, they find themselves in
a fantasy world.                           This is only
the first stage in a four stage building project. 
In the first
stage, a wooden fence will be built. The wooden fence will be built in
the form of a medieval palisade wall.  Oak and spruce wood will be used. No cement and
modern materials will be used so everything will be as natural as possible.
