Currently the great majority of Armenian teenagers smokes,
drinks or uses drugs. The teenagers from socially vulnerable families are in the highest risk group.
Their quantity is getting bigger and bigger every day, which leads to increase
of the number of diseases, newborns with different kinds of health problems and
mortality rate
among young population. It’s becoming a big issue for Armenia and
an appropriate solution is needed.

How, What, Why


WHAT
PeaceAnon is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problems and help others to recover from the effects of violent conflict.
The only requirement for membership is a desire to recover from violence. There are no dues or fees for PeaceAnon membership; we are self- supporting through our own contributions. PeaceAnon is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to activate non-violence in our lives and help others to do the same. 
- We believe that changing the world is an inside job. 
- We believe that the global cessation of violent conflict is possible.
- We believe that the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual solutions embodied in the 12 Steps so applied will prove successful for a wide variety of populations.
HOW



This July we will host the First Annual Conference of PeaceAnon and your financial support will help make it happen. 
It is our firm belief that the 12 Steps can be modified to help individuals and communities to recover from the devastating effects of human aggression and entrenched violent conflict and activate lasting peace in their lives. 
Since its introduction in 1935 the 12 Step Method has been modified numerous times to assist sufferers in dealing with many different issues. From substance addictions to obsessive gambling to eating disorders to compulsive spending, the method proves effective for those who engage it with rigor.
Simply put PeaceAnon is another branch on the 12 Step Program Tree and will operate in full compliance with the 12 Traditions and 12 Concepts of World Service. 
At this summer's conference a group of 30 12 Steppers, peace-builders, change agents, therapists, artists and leaders from all over the world will meet in Sweden to support the effort of again modifying the 12 Steps towards helping groups who are struggling to free themselves from any form of aggressive behaviour and conflict. That’s conflict such as war, domestic violence, gang violence, racism, bullying, or personal aggression of any kind.  



WHY
The ""why"" is simple. 
It's clear that our planet is struggling to free itself from war, environmental collapse, racism, poverty, sexism, addiction, lack of justice, lack of compassion, and profound inequities. As recovering people we have discovered some tools that we think can help. This is our mission, to help - nothing more, nothing less.
We are adapting the 12 Steps and 12 Traditions found in Alcoholics Anonymous et al in such a way that those methods and practices can be applied to populations that are want to free themselves from aggression.  These communities could be neighborhoods, cities or any population struggling with high rates of domestic violence, gang violence or war of any kind. 
PeaceAnon will give willing individuals and groups the tools needed to change their behavior through an open source peer-to-peer shared model of self-transformation. 
The 12 Step Movement already transforms the lives of the addicted by the millions. It does so without the use of institutional funding, political entanglements, or paid professional facilitation. We intend to replicate and expand this process to the aforementioned populations so that they may free themselves from aggressive and/or violent behaviour.



WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?


The $5000.00 dollars that we are asking for will go to:

- $3000.00

Our primary conference expenses are intra-Sweden travel, food, logistics, and accommodations for the 25 participants who are planning to attend this year's conference. 


- $1000.00 
Travel support for experts in the study of violence to attend the First Annual PeaceAnon World Conference. 
We need a lot of help in writing the book and imagining the program. We've invited peace-building experts from as far away as Ireland, Israel, Africa, and the USA to help us 12 Steppers better understand the special needs of individuals and communities suffering from violence.

It will be the primary guide to help people work the steps and begin to set up groups in their communities. These costs include office supplies and an upgraded hard drive for JW's aging MacBook.  


THE 7th TRADITION  ""Every A.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.” 



Regarding fundraising and the 7th tradition we wish to make clear that this fundraising effort is about supporting the PeaceAnon First Annual World Conference. It’s not about giving money to pay individual people. PeaceAnon groups will always be self-supporting through their own contributions. 
It’s for this reason that we are offering no perks, partnerships or products in exchange for your support. We are not a business. Making money beyond what is required to be of service to others is not our concern. Being of service is its own reward.

Risks & Challenges
 We see the risks and challenges to creating this program as being mostly of our own making. That is to say we have to walk the talk and keep ego in check.

</p><p>My name is Emma Asonye, a
linguist, academic and the President and Founder of Save the Deaf and Endangered
Languages Initiative, a community based non-governmental organization working
with the Deaf children and youths in Imo State Nigeria. Our organization
organized and hosted the first Deaf Talent Show in Nigeria in 2014 tagged
“Naija Deaf Got Talent”.</p>
<p>I developed my passion
for the Deaf children in 2001 when I had the first encounter with the Deaf
students at the Schools for the Deaf Orodo and Orlu in Imo State being in the
team of delegates that accompanied a sign language expert from Canada, Anne
Marie Wieseman to donate study materials to the schools. In the course of
interaction, she noticed that there was no electricity in the building and she
asked then, “In the night how do you communicate?” and the replied, “In the
night, no communication.”</p><p>
</p><p>11 years after, when I
began my research on communication disorder, I found out that the Deaf students
and pupils of the above schools are still vulnerable to the different acts of
stigmatization and isolation I witnessed when I first met them – abandoned in
their world of darkness, living in dormitories with no security, no staff;
exposed to all sorts of sexual violence and bullying, no proper medical
attention nor information about their health, HIV/AIDS and sex education.</p>
<p>In 2014, we launched a
long term project tagged “Fighting for the Vulnerable” through which we want to
fight against Deaf stigmatization, Deaf street begging and sexual violence
against Deaf girls and achieve the human capital development of the Deaf
children and youths. This we are set to achieve with the collaborative efforts
of the parents of the Deaf children, community people and a team of our
volunteers made up of young graduates and undergraduates from different
tertiary institutions in Nigeria. </p>
<p>Your contributions will
help to restore sight to some hundreds of Deaf children and so prevent
potential cases of deaf-blindness. Your contribution will for the first time bring
HIV/AIDS awareness and sex education to the knowledge of these Deaf kids and
give them a sense of belonging to the society.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Our project of “Fighting
for the Vulnerable” is focused on our commitment to the total human capital
development of the Deaf children and youths, and our commitment to stopping
Deaf stigmatization in Nigeria in line with the global commitment in stopping
the stigmatization and victimization of the vulnerable.</p>
<p>As for the Deaf children,
we found out that the stigmatization they are subjected to begins from their
families as there is little or no communication between them and their family
members, coupled with the age long erroneous belief that a Deaf child is a
curse to the family. As a result, we began our “Stop Deaf Stigmatization
Campaign” with various sensitization meetings with the parents of these Deaf
students after which we created a sign language class for parents of the Deaf
at our academy in Owerri. Then in 2014, we organized the first ever Deaf Talent
Show in Nigeria, in which some selected Deaf youths from the two schools were
given the opportunity of displaying their potentials in the event tagged “Naija
Deaf Got Talent”.</p>
<p><b>Risks
and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our major challenge in this
project is the communication barrier between the team members and the Deaf
students, as none of my team members is a sign language user and most of the
hearing teachers in the two schools are not effective sign language users and
so cannot interpret for the resource persons. As a result, we are making plans
to hire about 4 sign language interpreters from around the neighborhood to
assist us.</p>
<p>Another obvious risk is
in the case of any student being diagnosed of HIV/AIDS, to achieve a successful
counselling and treatment would involve the parents most of whom put a callous
attitude towards their Deaf children. Since counselling may be referred to a
certified hospital, this will equally require the services of an interpreter
and they are grossly lacking in our community.</p>
<p><b>The
Present Project</b></p>
<p>In the present project of
5 days medical outreach to the Secondary School for the Deaf Ofekata Orodo in
the month of May, and a 4 days medical outreach to the Primary School for the
Deaf and Mentally Challenged Orlu, we want to give 370 students and about 250
pupils of the two schools the privilege of medical care focusing on eye
screening and treatment, HIV/AIDS screening and awareness campaign, plus sex
education.</p>
<p><b>Project
Cost</b></p>
<p>We need the sum of $12,000
to execute this project which will cover the cost of:</p>

<br/><p></p></div>","My name is Emma Asonye, a
linguist, academic and the President and Founder of Save the Deaf and Endangered
Languages Initiative, a community based non-governmental organization working
with the Deaf children and youths in Imo State Nigeria. Our organization
organized and hosted the first Deaf Talent Show in Nigeria in 2014 tagged
“Naija Deaf Got Talent”.
I developed my passion
for the Deaf children in 2001 when I had the first encounter with the Deaf
students at the Schools for the Deaf Orodo and Orlu in Imo State being in the
team of delegates that accompanied a sign language expert from Canada, Anne
Marie Wieseman to donate study materials to the schools. In the course of
interaction, she noticed that there was no electricity in the building and she
asked then, “In the night how do you communicate?” and the replied, “In the
night, no communication.”
11 years after, when I
began my research on communication disorder, I found out that the Deaf students
and pupils of the above schools are still vulnerable to the different acts of
stigmatization and isolation I witnessed when I first met them – abandoned in
their world of darkness, living in dormitories with no security, no staff;
exposed to all sorts of sexual violence and bullying, no proper medical
attention nor information about their health, HIV/AIDS and sex education.
In 2014, we launched a
long term project tagged “Fighting for the Vulnerable” through which we want to
fight against Deaf stigmatization, Deaf street begging and sexual violence
against Deaf girls and achieve the human capital development of the Deaf
children and youths. This we are set to achieve with the collaborative efforts
of the parents of the Deaf children, community people and a team of our
volunteers made up of young graduates and undergraduates from different
tertiary institutions in Nigeria. 
Your contributions will
help to restore sight to some hundreds of Deaf children and so prevent
potential cases of deaf-blindness. Your contribution will for the first time bring
HIV/AIDS awareness and sex education to the knowledge of these Deaf kids and
give them a sense of belonging to the society.
The
Impact
Our project of “Fighting
for the Vulnerable” is focused on our commitment to the total human capital
development of the Deaf children and youths, and our commitment to stopping
Deaf stigmatization in Nigeria in line with the global commitment in stopping
the stigmatization and victimization of the vulnerable.
As for the Deaf children,
we found out that the stigmatization they are subjected to begins from their
families as there is little or no communication between them and their family
members, coupled with the age long erroneous belief that a Deaf child is a
curse to the family. As a result, we began our “Stop Deaf Stigmatization
Campaign” with various sensitization meetings with the parents of these Deaf
students after which we created a sign language class for parents of the Deaf
at our academy in Owerri. Then in 2014, we organized the first ever Deaf Talent
Show in Nigeria, in which some selected Deaf youths from the two schools were
given the opportunity of displaying their potentials in the event tagged “Naija
Deaf Got Talent”.
Risks
and Challenges
Our major challenge in this
project is the communication barrier between the team members and the Deaf
students, as none of my team members is a sign language user and most of the
hearing teachers in the two schools are not effective sign language users and
so cannot interpret for the resource persons. As a result, we are making plans
to hire about 4 sign language interpreters from around the neighborhood to
assist us.
Another obvious risk is
in the case of any student being diagnosed of HIV/AIDS, to achieve a successful
counselling and treatment would involve the parents most of whom put a callous
attitude towards their Deaf children. Since counselling may be referred to a
certified hospital, this will equally require the services of an interpreter
and they are grossly lacking in our community.
The
Present Project
In the present project of
5 days medical outreach to the Secondary School for the Deaf Ofekata Orodo in
the month of May, and a 4 days medical outreach to the Primary School for the
Deaf and Mentally Challenged Orlu, we want to give 370 students and about 250
pupils of the two schools the privilege of medical care focusing on eye
screening and treatment, HIV/AIDS screening and awareness campaign, plus sex
education.
Project
Cost
We need the sum of $12,000
to execute this project which will cover the cost of:
- 
Drugs 
- 
HIV/AIDS kits and other kits
- 
200 pieces of frames and lenses
- 
Transportation to and from Project site
- 
Light refreshment for team members
Including the services
of:
- 
5 Nurses
- 
5 Optometrists
- 
5 Lab Scientists
- 
2 Pharmacists
- 
3 Medical doctors
- 
6 Sign language interpreters
- 
10 Volunteer workers on logistics
Meanwhile, if we do not
reach our goal within the stipulated period, we will do the project only at the
Secondary School Orodo.

<p>Drug repositioning (or repurposing) is a drug development process of discovering new applications for existing therapeutics towards other diseases. It builds upon previous clinical developments of the therapeutics' safety and for its original indication. In comparison to new drugs, <b>repurposed drugs may bypass much of the early costs and time associated with clinical development (such as Phase I clinical trials)</b>.

<p>There have been <b>numerous counts of successes</b> of drug repurposing <b>throughout history</b> in the pharmaceutical industry. <b>Examples of repurposed drugs</b> include Viagra, originally for Angina, for Erectile Dysfunction and Thalidomide, originally for Morning Sickness, for Multiple Myelomas. It is important to note the risks of drug repositioning projects failing are still as with any drug development projects, However, they are <b>significantly lower</b> in comparison to traditional drug development.

</div></div>","Drug discovery in 5 Pediatric Rare Diseases which could affect your kids:

 Cystic Fibrosis

 Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

 Gaucher Disease

 Niemann Pick Disease Type C

 Osteogenesis Imperfecta




These diseases affect more than 1 million children worldwide.


Using already known medicines; fast, safe, cheap and de-risked development.


In addition to this campaign, SOM Biotech will push any positive result to the market.

Rare diseases, also known as orphan diseases, are illnesses which affect a small portion of the world population (around 6-8%). According to the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD) there are around 7000 rare diseases known to exist worldwide, most of them without cures and significant treatments available. Research motivation into these diseases has been largely neglected due to small populations being afflicted, then continuing lack of knowledge and the potential low return on investments.




Pediatric rare diseases are one of the most complicated forms of rare diseases, with approximately 50% of rare diseases known to affect children worldwide. Moreover, many of the rare diseases treatments on the market are not applicable to pediatric populations. Some of the most continuing burdensome pediatric rare diseases include:
1. Cystic Fibrosis - Info
Abnormal production of thick fluids leading to obstructions and complications, of the respiratory and digestive systems.

Approximately rare diseas 70,000 - 100,000 people affected worldwide.
More than 95% of men are sterile.
Despite improvements, people have reduced life expectancies in comparison to the general population (˜35 years old).
 Gene Mutation: CFTR (Autosomal Recessive Inheritance).




2. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - Info
Progressive muscle degeneration and weakness resulting in: mobility, respiratory, and skeletal development problems.

Approximately 300,000 people affected worldwide.
Males primarily affected, rare in females.
Estimated 1/3500 male births affected worldwide.
Approximately 20,000 new cases/year.
Inmobility usually occurs by ˜ 12 years old.
Estimated life expectancy: 25 years old, >30 years old (rarer)
 Gene Mutation: Dystrophin (Autosomal Recessive Inheritance).





3. Gaucher Disease (3 types) - Info
Accumulation of fatty substances, including glucocerebrosides and glycosphingolipids, within cells leading to tissue and organ complications (such as enlargement of the spleen and liver).

Estimated 1/75,000 people affected worldwide.
3 types exist (types 2 and 3 - most severe):

Type 1: Most common, without nervous system affected.
Types 2 and 3: Nervous system affected (Type 2: death usually before 2 years old.

 Gene Mutation: GBA (Autosomal Recessive Inheritance).




4. Niemann Pick Disease Type C - Info
Another disease involving the accumulation of fatty substances, within cells, leading to tissue and organ complications (including: brain, spleen and liver).

Estimated 1/120,000 births affected worldwide.
Can occur between infancy and adulthood, but usually in childhood.
Disease is always fatal (majority die between the ages of 10 and 25 years old).
 Gene Mutation: NPC1 and/or NPC2 (Autosomal Recessive Inheritance).




5. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bones Disease) - Info
Abnormalities in collagen production, leading to skeletal deformities and bone fragilities.

Approximately 6 – 7/100,000 people affected worldwide.
Males and females equally affected.
At least 8 types of the disease exist.
Types 1 and 4: Most common

 Mild-moderate severity, near normal lifespan (with support).

Type 2 and 3: Most severe 

 Type 2: frequently lethal at or post-birth.
 Type 3: fractures begin in early in life, shortened lifespan.

 Gene Mutation: COL1A1 and/or COL1A2  are the most common (mostly cases of Autosomal Dominant Inheritance).








SOM Biotech SL (SOM) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical group established at the Barcelona Science Park (PCB), Spain, in 2009. We are dedicated towards discovering and developing therapeutics for rare diseases by identifying new potential uses for existing therapeutics (drug repositioning).

We presently have several programs under discovery including two rare disease programs in advanced clinical stages for Transthyretin-related Hereditary Amyloidosis and Huntington's Disease, both demonstrating positively significant results.
SOM Biotech was also the winner of the 2013 EntrepreneurXXI award, presented by La Caixa Bank (one of Spain's largest banks) in conjunction with the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism. This prestigious award was presented to Spanish start-up companies with the greatest growth potential.




As a new initiative, SOM Biotech is now turning its attention towards discovering new therapeutic options for pediatric rare diseases. Specifically, we aim to tackle the 5 burdensome pediatric rare diseases mentioned.




SOM Biotech possesses a proprietary know-how discovery process, capable of identifying new activities for existing compounds which are already on the market for another use. Upon discovery, the compounds are validated experimentally and patent-protected before proceeding directly to Phase II clinical trials in patients. Later stages of the projects would be co-developed with other pharmaceutical companies to reach the market.









Drug repositioning (or repurposing) is a drug development process of discovering new applications for existing therapeutics towards other diseases. It builds upon previous clinical developments of the therapeutics' safety and for its original indication. In comparison to new drugs, repurposed drugs may bypass much of the early costs and time associated with clinical development (such as Phase I clinical trials).




There have been numerous counts of successes of drug repurposing throughout history in the pharmaceutical industry. Examples of repurposed drugs include Viagra, originally for Angina, for Erectile Dysfunction and Thalidomide, originally for Morning Sickness, for Multiple Myelomas. It is important to note the risks of drug repositioning projects failing are still as with any drug development projects, However, they are significantly lower in comparison to traditional drug development.










 Target Funding Goal of the campaign: at least 300,000 USD$.

 Funds will be distributed evenly among the 5 Pediatric Rare Diseases.

 SOM will take responsibility to cover the entire developmental costs from the initial discovery stages to the market of any promising drug.








 Limited funding has been provided to promote the health and scientific R&D sectors.

 Improve scientific and/or clinical knowledge of the various pediatric rare diseases..

 Possibility of discovering new therapeutic options which may be beneficial in dealing with the selected pediatric rare diseases.

 Provide hope to the children afflicted from the various rare diseases, of which no cures exist to this date or ineffective treatments are available.







We welcome any help in making this opportunity happen, and hope to make a significant medical contributions through our discoveries. Please share this campaign and bring awareness to your friends, family, colleagues and everyone you know! 
Share our campaign link (http://igg.me/at/fightrarediseases) with everyone on Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and other social media platforms!

<p>Imagine hatred so strong it drives people to kill. Now imagine it in your town. In your neighbourhood. In your family. </p>
<p>Hatred like this is happening right now, in Kenya's Rift Valley. People are dying, now. They are fleeing their homes, now.</p>
<p>The 2015 Walk for Peace brings together the world's top athletes, many of them Kenyan themselves, and the people of the Rift Valley in a powerful statement for peace and reconciliation between communities in conflict.</p>
<p>From 15 July to 8 August they will run and walk 522 miles through this troubled region, raising money and awareness for the peace education programs these communities so desperately need.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<p>We need you to join this journey for peace by bringing your support to a program for peace-building that can sweep away the growing culture of armed violence destroying lives across Kenya’s Rift Valley, especially between the Turkana and Pokot communities. In the past 18 months alone, hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. </p>

AND YOU...




Imagine hatred so strong it drives people to kill. Now imagine it in your town. In your neighbourhood. In your family. 
Hatred like this is happening right now, in Kenya's Rift Valley. People are dying, now. They are fleeing their homes, now.
The 2015 Walk for Peace brings together the world's top athletes, many of them Kenyan themselves, and the people of the Rift Valley in a powerful statement for peace and reconciliation between communities in conflict.
From 15 July to 8 August they will run and walk 522 miles through this troubled region, raising money and awareness for the peace education programs these communities so desperately need.

We need you to join this journey for peace by bringing your support to a program for peace-building that can sweep away the growing culture of armed violence destroying lives across Kenya’s Rift Valley, especially between the Turkana and Pokot communities. In the past 18 months alone, hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. 


“Supported by the Aegis Trust, which has shown how peace can be built in Rwanda, we are going to inspire and engage young people from divided communities, and help to break the cycles of violence,” says organiser and Commonwealth Gold Medallist John Kelai. For John, from Turkana County, it's personal. Three of his uncles were shot dead by Pokot cattle rustlers. Now former Pokot cattle rustler Julius Arile is one of the athletes taking part in the Walk for Peace. ""Running has given us a platform to create change,"" he says. ""Will you come with us?""

Who's involved - and what we'll do

Led by Kenya's star athletes and coordinated by the Aegis Trust, the Champions Walk for Peace aims to raise $250,000 for a peacebuilding programme that will engage directly with at least 10,000 young people at risk of being caught up in inter-ethnic violence in the Rift Valley - saving lives, preventing displacement and averting human suffering.


The project aims to build capacity for peace building
in three main constituencies: 



Women, because they have the
ability to engage deeply and take strong leadership in peace building
activities in spite of often being most disadvantaged by physical and sexual
violence and other issues in conflict;


Religious leaders, because they
have the capacity to be a strong pacifying influence at the national and community
levels;

Youth, who are the future, who
are at risk of becoming involved in violence and yet may be most receptive to
education for peace.

The project also aims to promote pan-African
support and cooperation between Kenya and Rwanda in service of peace, and to
convey an inspiring message of hope and lessons learned from the experience of
Rwanda.

<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD is a deeply distressing, or disturbing experience that creates an
unresolved impact on the individual. Victims are often are not aware
that the symptoms that they experience are a result of their trauma.
They struggle in a kind of purgatory of anxiety that eludes their own
conscious abilities. Mental illness represents not a cognitive
impairment, but an attempted interpretation of inexplicable internal
states. PTSD in short, is a pathological state of fear. </span></p>

<p>Veterans for Entheogenic Therapy (VET) hopes to become a nonprofit and complete related missions with your help. Your contribution will assist our organization with:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Filing for a 501.C3 nonprofit - we want to be more sustainable by enabling folks to donate whenever they can afford it, and being a nonprofit will allow for that.</li>
<li>
<a href=""reset.me/story/soldier-turned-researcher-announces-new-ayahuasca-study"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Funding our IRB-approved observational study</a> looking at the effects of ayahuasca on chronic post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD in U.S. veterans</li>
<li>We organize group retreats with PTSD veterans to Peru and other countrys where ayahuasca is fully legal (This includes flight, housing, ground transportation, food and general retreat expenses) This program has not yet reached its full potential as many of the veterans supporting these trips are volunteering time outside of their jobs)</li>
<li>Publicly addressing the need for alternative treatment options for veterans by speaking at conferences around the country related to the topic of PTSD (VA, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Research Center for PTSD, Psychedelic Science) and required administrative and logistical support that comes with outreach. </li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Our Goal is to reach $20,000 in 45 days, every donation helps!</b></h2>
<div><b>Please help veterans find the piece that they deserve. Veterans who have already come forward about this medicine have stamped approval, we have our mission to combat suicide, now we need your help to carry out our orders. If we exceed our fund-raising goals, the funds will go directly toward mission efforts of organizing retreats and funding veterans expenses.</b></div>
<p><b>What you get</b></p>
<p>Every donor will get the satisfaction of knowing that they contributed to a cause that will provide relief for veterans where other treatment options have failed. You will also be provided with personal testimony from a veteran diagnosed with PTSD who benefited from your donation as a result of our ayahuasca retreats.<br/></p>
<p>Donors who contribute a minimum of $50 will receive a VET Logo T-shirt. This will be contingent on whether or not we meet our fundraising goal of $20,000. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>There are two fronts that Veterans for Entheogenic Therapy are fighting on:</div>
<div><ol>
<li>Science - We are working with various research organizations in the field of psychiatry, psychology, neurology, behavioral pharmacology, ethnobotany, and many more  including Rick Doblin, founder of the <a href=""www.maps.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Multi-Disciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies</a> (MAPS), Dennis McKenna and David Nichols of the <a href=""www.heffter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heffter Institute</a>, as well as many other researchers in the field of psychdelics and PTSD. VET is in this for the long haul, and through science our goal is to give ayahuasca and other psychedelics their place among medicine in the United States. This may take decades, but if we have the support to conduct rigorous scientific research the road can be paved. Currently, the founder of VET, Ryan LeCompte, a former Marine infantryman and M.A. candidate at Naropa University in Boulder, CO, is conducting an observational study with IRB-approval through his graduate program. This study will show the medical and scientific community that ayahuasca can be a viable treatment option for veterans diagnosed with treatment-resistant PTSD. Here are <a href=""http://www.maps.org/research"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studies</a> currently being conducted looking at psychedelics and various mental health issues.</li>
<li>Community Outreach - In addition to our 12 veteran observational study, we have an overwhelming number of veterans seeking treatment that cannot afford the costly expenses of travel and accommodations required to attend retreats in Peru. Meanwhile, every day that passes we lose 22 of our nation's warriors to suicide. In response to the requests from veterans, we want to narrow down our organizational capabilities and efficiency by increasing the number of trips to Peru as we can. </li>

We are a group of veterans seeking financial support from you to provide awareness, education, safety, and research around alternative options including ayahuasca for veterans suffering from a complex issue that is facing the nation today: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD. Ryan LeCompte, the founder of VET is a former United States Marine infantryman (MOS 0311) who served on active-duty from 2007-2011. He is also a graduate student completing a Masters Degree in Transpersonal Counseling Psychology at Naropa University in Boulder, C.O.

What is Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and how badly is it affecting our veterans coming home?


Post-traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD is a deeply distressing, or disturbing experience that creates an
unresolved impact on the individual. Victims are often are not aware
that the symptoms that they experience are a result of their trauma.
They struggle in a kind of purgatory of anxiety that eludes their own
conscious abilities. Mental illness represents not a cognitive
impairment, but an attempted interpretation of inexplicable internal
states. PTSD in short, is a pathological state of fear.

Treatment
Challenges at the VA


PTSD
shows a high-rate of treatment-resistance. Treatments in existence
today are showing unresponsiveness to treatment. For those that do
seek treatment, are often left feeling helpless due to a limiting
capacity to offer resolution. 

Sgt. Candice Gagnon, USMC Afghan VET, AND VET member, talks about her own PTSD and ayahuasca
Right now, there are 22 veterans a day that are taking their own lives according to the Veterans
Administration recent study. (This is excluding incidental deaths
related to PTSD, such as drunk driving, etc.) My brothers and sisters are
turning to “self-medicating” as a result of the endless discrepancies and
numerous issues at the VA sometimes caused by under-staffing, which leads to a
backlog in providing the proper and necessary treatment to veterans who are on the brink
of life and death to due mental illness. A recent story released by the New York Times covered the forced retirement of several top
executives at the VA, has clearly added to the list of reasons for the
consideration of alternative treatment for veterans with a resistance to
therapy. Here are just a few links both anecdotal and scientific findings) that
add to the long list:

What is Ayahuasca?
You are not alone if you have no idea what ayahuasca is or means. Ayahuasca is the name given to both the vine ( banisteriopsis caapi ) and the psychotropic drink prepared by boiling the vine together with various admixtures plants. Here in Iquitos the most common admixture used is “chacruna” ( psychotria vidris ) or “chalipunga”, another plant in the chacruna family. 



More info here: http://www.vetentheogenic.squarespace.com/resources-and-education/
And here: http://www.ayahuasca-info.com/introduction/
VET recently organized a trip
with fellow veterans diagnosed with treatment-resistant chronic PTSD to travel
to Peru and Lisa Ling from CNN followed us on our journey that was aired
on prime-time national news. The name of the series is called, “This is Life” w/ Lisa Ling and the episode is called Jungle Fix. The full episode can be seen on Sundays at 10pm EST on CNN or below 





Full-length documentary - 
Here is a full length article from a fellow Marine, Richard Stroder who deployed to Iraq and was diagnosed with PTSD after he got home. He explains how his ayahuasca retreat with VET last year has helped him.
http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/23/opinion/veteran-p...

Here is a podcast that VET founder, Ryan LeCompte did with Dr. Rick Doblin, founder of MAPS where they talked about PTSD and psychedelics in veterans. 


How can you help?
Veterans for Entheogenic Therapy (VET) hopes to become a nonprofit and complete related missions with your help. Your contribution will assist our organization with:


Filing for a 501.C3 nonprofit - we want to be more sustainable by enabling folks to donate whenever they can afford it, and being a nonprofit will allow for that.

Funding our IRB-approved observational study looking at the effects of ayahuasca on chronic post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD in U.S. veterans
We organize group retreats with PTSD veterans to Peru and other countrys where ayahuasca is fully legal (This includes flight, housing, ground transportation, food and general retreat expenses) This program has not yet reached its full potential as many of the veterans supporting these trips are volunteering time outside of their jobs)
Publicly addressing the need for alternative treatment options for veterans by speaking at conferences around the country related to the topic of PTSD (VA, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, National Research Center for PTSD, Psychedelic Science) and required administrative and logistical support that comes with outreach. 

Our Goal is to reach $20,000 in 45 days, every donation helps!
Please help veterans find the piece that they deserve. Veterans who have already come forward about this medicine have stamped approval, we have our mission to combat suicide, now we need your help to carry out our orders. If we exceed our fund-raising goals, the funds will go directly toward mission efforts of organizing retreats and funding veterans expenses.
What you get
Every donor will get the satisfaction of knowing that they contributed to a cause that will provide relief for veterans where other treatment options have failed. You will also be provided with personal testimony from a veteran diagnosed with PTSD who benefited from your donation as a result of our ayahuasca retreats.
Donors who contribute a minimum of $50 will receive a VET Logo T-shirt. This will be contingent on whether or not we meet our fundraising goal of $20,000. 


    
The Impact
There are two fronts that Veterans for Entheogenic Therapy are fighting on:

Science - We are working with various research organizations in the field of psychiatry, psychology, neurology, behavioral pharmacology, ethnobotany, and many more  including Rick Doblin, founder of the Multi-Disciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), Dennis McKenna and David Nichols of the Heffter Institute, as well as many other researchers in the field of psychdelics and PTSD. VET is in this for the long haul, and through science our goal is to give ayahuasca and other psychedelics their place among medicine in the United States. This may take decades, but if we have the support to conduct rigorous scientific research the road can be paved. Currently, the founder of VET, Ryan LeCompte, a former Marine infantryman and M.A. candidate at Naropa University in Boulder, CO, is conducting an observational study with IRB-approval through his graduate program. This study will show the medical and scientific community that ayahuasca can be a viable treatment option for veterans diagnosed with treatment-resistant PTSD. Here are studies currently being conducted looking at psychedelics and various mental health issues.
Community Outreach - In addition to our 12 veteran observational study, we have an overwhelming number of veterans seeking treatment that cannot afford the costly expenses of travel and accommodations required to attend retreats in Peru. Meanwhile, every day that passes we lose 22 of our nation's warriors to suicide. In response to the requests from veterans, we want to narrow down our organizational capabilities and efficiency by increasing the number of trips to Peru as we can. 
 Other Ways You Can Help
 Some of you just cannot afford to donate, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Here are some ways you can:  Get the word out about our study, organization and our campaign to raise funds - military folks are loud, and we give you our blessing to do the same :)

Please help us reach our goal of $3,500 total by contributing here or via check to SSE, only $750 to go!  Growing food is an experience and a skill that all children should have. Farming celebrates our past and will contribute to a more resilient future. Locally, produced, organic food supports pollinators, people, and lowers our carbon footprint. Studies have shown that gardening enhances childrens' imagination, decreases aggression, and boosts classroom performance. A garden will also create new ways to connect with the many agricultural organisations and events on the Island, such as Seedy Saturday, the Fall Fair, weekly markets, the Farmers Institute, Island Growers, and many more.Parents and teachers at Salt Spring Elementary (194 kids), Saltspring Middle School (300 students), and the ELF preschool program want to share gardening experiences with their children. The Garden Committee plans to construct this multi-school garden located on a sunny hillside by providing better access from classrooms and by installing terraced, raised beds, mulched pathways, stairs, and seating. A strong deer fence already protects the rocky, south-facing slope, but it lacks necessary safety, access, and moisture retention infrastructure. A hose spigot and electricity are nearby, as well as roof downspouts for potential rainwater harvest.We are working closely with teachers and community partners. Farmers, growers and gatherers are the backbone of Salt Spring Island, and local experts in gardening and farming, seed saving, and ecologists are already involved with school programs. Access to a safe, terraced garden will enhance these programs. The new garden will include hands-on experiences with native vegetation; pollinator-friendly plantings; growing and harvesting fruit trees, berries, and vegetables; and composting and permaculture techniques.With new Nature Programs at the school, fresh support from teachers and parents, and better infrastructure, we aim to engage students in transforming this exposed slope into a beautiful outdoor classroom and food-growing garden. Specifically, your grant would fund eight 3'x8' terraced, raised beds constructed using sustainable rammed earth technology, hand-built by school families and community volunteers.To build these, local businesses are donating time, expertise, sand and soil, and excavation - thank you Charles Excavating & Terra Firma! And, we'll need lots of volunteers with strong backs!

Τουλάχιστον όχι με την παραδοσιακή έννοια. Αν θεωρήσουμε Πολιτική την συνισταμένη των ηθικών συμπεριφορών των μελών μιας κοινωνίας, από τον πρώτο έως τον τελευταίο πολίτη, τότε ναι, κάνουμε πολιτική. Πολιτική της ορθής σκέψης και των αγνών συναισθημάτων που εκφράζονται μέσα από την έννοια Φιλότιμο. Λέξη-επικεφαλίδα κάθε ένδοξου κεφαλαίου του ελληνικού πολιτισμού, στα θεμέλια του σύγχρονου παγκόσμιου.</p><p>Η πρόταση μας είναι απλή. Βοηθήστε να επαναπροσδιορίσουμε τη λέξη Φιλότιμο μεταξύ μας και κατόπιν να την εισαγάγουμε στα διεθνή λεξικά μεταφρασμένη στα αγγλικά ως <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/philotimon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">‘Philotimo’</a>.</p><p><strong>Γιατί χρίζει το ‘Φιλότιμο’ επαναπροσδιορισμού;</strong></p><p>Γιατί απλά όπως κάθε έννοια στο επίκεντρο της ζωής του Πολίτη, όπως η ελευθερία, η δημοκρατία, η δικαιοσύνη, και τα ανθρώπινα δικαιώματα μεταξύ άλλων, αναπόδραστα χρωματίζονται και επαξιώνονται (ή απαξιώνονται) μέσα στον ρου της εξέλιξης της σύγχρονης κοινωνίας και στους συσχετισμούς μεταξύ ατομικού και κοινωνικού συμφέροντος. Ξεκινώντας από το Φιλότιμο, τον ακρογωνιαίο λίθο του πολιτισμικού μας DNA, έχουμε καλύτερες πιθανότητες να καταλήξουμε σε κοινή συναίνεση δίχως την ανάγκη μεσαζόντων (ίσως εκτός μιας ανεξάρτητης επιστημονικής ομάδας). Η διαδικασία θα μας βοηθήσει να αναγνωρίσουμε την αξία της κοινής συναίνεσης ως πρωταρχικό συστατικό κοινωνικής συνοχής και εθνικής ταυτότητας, και των προκλήσεων αλλά και ευεργετημάτων που επιφυλάσσει ο διάλογος παρόμοιων διαδικασιών. Τέλος, η διαδικασία επαναπροσδιορισμού της έννοιας Φιλότιμο, ίσως μας βοηθήσει να προσπελάσουμε αναχρονιστικά εθνικά αφηγήματα που αναστέλλουν την συμβίωση και πρόοδο μας εντός μιας παγκόσμιας διεθνούς κοινότητας.</p><p><strong>Γιατί να το εισαγάγουμε στα διεθνή λεξικά; </strong></p><p>Γιατί είναι το απλούστερο συλλογικό εγχείρημα στο οποίο μπορούμε όλοι να συμβάλλουμε από όπου κι αν βρισκόμαστε, μέσα από τον υπολογιστή ή το κινητό μας. Γιατί αποτελεί παράλληλα διεκδίκηση θέσης αλλά και παραχώρηση χρήσης μια έννοιας με πανανθρώπινο νόημα. Για να ανατρέξει κανείς στην τελευταία φορά που Ελληνική λέξη εποίκησε ξένο λεξικό ή λεξιλόγιο θα πρέπει να γυρίσει πίσω αρκετούς αιώνες. Πίσω στον καιρό όπου ο Ελληνικός πολιτισμός εξάσκησε και τελειοποίησε μέσα από λέξεις-σύμβολα καινοτομίες όπως την φιλοσοφία, τη ρητορική, τη δημοκρατία, τον Ολυμπισμό. Όλοι θυμόμαστε την «Αθήνα» που κατέκτησε την κατακτήτρια «Ρώμη» με τη γλώσσα και τις τέχνες της. Γιατί τέλος, η παγκόσμια κοινότητα είναι έτοιμη να δεχτεί την καινοτομία στο επίπεδο συσχετισμών Πολίτη-Συμπολίτη και Πολιτείας-Πολιτών όσο ποτέ άλλοτε στη σύγχρονη ιστορία της. Και γιατί ίσως η ιδέα Φιλότιμο, πρώτα ζυμωμένη μεταξύ Ελλήνων, αποτελέσει φάρο νοήματος και για τους «έξω».</p><p> </p><h2><strong><u>Η Πρωτοβουλία</u></strong></h2><p>Η <strong><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/manos_hatzimalonas/-_252_b_6400220.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Πρωτοβουλία #Philotimo</a></strong> ξεκίνησε από το Λονδίνο το 2011, με τη συνειδητοποίηση του ερευνητικού κενού στη σύγχρονη διεθνή βιβλιογραφία γύρω από την σύνθετη έννοια της λέξης Φιλότιμο την κεντρικότερη αξία της Ελληνικής πολιτισμικής ταυτότητας. Η ιδέα του να αναζητηθεί το «χαμένο φιλότιμο» όπως συχνά αναφέρεται, ξεκίνησε ένα συναρπαστικό ταξίδι με απίθανες συμπτώσεις και εποικοδομητικές συναντήσεις που οδήγησαν στην δημιουργία της μη-κερδοσκοπικής startup πλατφόρμας σκέψης/δράσης<strong> <a href=""http://www.philotimo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">«Φιλότιμο Ίδρυμα»</a></strong> τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2014.</p><p>Αποτελούμαστε από μια <strong>διεθνή ομάδα φίλων,</strong> εξειδικευμένων σε πεδία μεταξύ άλλων της ψυχολογίας και των κοινωνικών επιστημών, του μάρκετινγκ, της ιατρικής, της στατιστικής επιστήμης και της επιστήμης υπολογιστών, όπου ένωσε γύρω από αυτό τον σκοπό τις ιδέες, τις δυνάμεις και τις οικονομίες της.

Τουλάχιστον όχι με την παραδοσιακή έννοια. Αν θεωρήσουμε Πολιτική την συνισταμένη των ηθικών συμπεριφορών των μελών μιας κοινωνίας, από τον πρώτο έως τον τελευταίο πολίτη, τότε ναι, κάνουμε πολιτική. Πολιτική της ορθής σκέψης και των αγνών συναισθημάτων που εκφράζονται μέσα από την έννοια Φιλότιμο. Λέξη-επικεφαλίδα κάθε ένδοξου κεφαλαίου του ελληνικού πολιτισμού, στα θεμέλια του σύγχρονου παγκόσμιου.Η πρόταση μας είναι απλή. Βοηθήστε να επαναπροσδιορίσουμε τη λέξη Φιλότιμο μεταξύ μας και κατόπιν να την εισαγάγουμε στα διεθνή λεξικά μεταφρασμένη στα αγγλικά ως ‘Philotimo’.Γιατί χρίζει το ‘Φιλότιμο’ επαναπροσδιορισμού;Γιατί απλά όπως κάθε έννοια στο επίκεντρο της ζωής του Πολίτη, όπως η ελευθερία, η δημοκρατία, η δικαιοσύνη, και τα ανθρώπινα δικαιώματα μεταξύ άλλων, αναπόδραστα χρωματίζονται και επαξιώνονται (ή απαξιώνονται) μέσα στον ρου της εξέλιξης της σύγχρονης κοινωνίας και στους συσχετισμούς μεταξύ ατομικού και κοινωνικού συμφέροντος. Ξεκινώντας από το Φιλότιμο, τον ακρογωνιαίο λίθο του πολιτισμικού μας DNA, έχουμε καλύτερες πιθανότητες να καταλήξουμε σε κοινή συναίνεση δίχως την ανάγκη μεσαζόντων (ίσως εκτός μιας ανεξάρτητης επιστημονικής ομάδας). Η διαδικασία θα μας βοηθήσει να αναγνωρίσουμε την αξία της κοινής συναίνεσης ως πρωταρχικό συστατικό κοινωνικής συνοχής και εθνικής ταυτότητας, και των προκλήσεων αλλά και ευεργετημάτων που επιφυλάσσει ο διάλογος παρόμοιων διαδικασιών. Τέλος, η διαδικασία επαναπροσδιορισμού της έννοιας Φιλότιμο, ίσως μας βοηθήσει να προσπελάσουμε αναχρονιστικά εθνικά αφηγήματα που αναστέλλουν την συμβίωση και πρόοδο μας εντός μιας παγκόσμιας διεθνούς κοινότητας.Γιατί να το εισαγάγουμε στα διεθνή λεξικά; Γιατί είναι το απλούστερο συλλογικό εγχείρημα στο οποίο μπορούμε όλοι να συμβάλλουμε από όπου κι αν βρισκόμαστε, μέσα από τον υπολογιστή ή το κινητό μας. Γιατί αποτελεί παράλληλα διεκδίκηση θέσης αλλά και παραχώρηση χρήσης μια έννοιας με πανανθρώπινο νόημα. Για να ανατρέξει κανείς στην τελευταία φορά που Ελληνική λέξη εποίκησε ξένο λεξικό ή λεξιλόγιο θα πρέπει να γυρίσει πίσω αρκετούς αιώνες. Πίσω στον καιρό όπου ο Ελληνικός πολιτισμός εξάσκησε και τελειοποίησε μέσα από λέξεις-σύμβολα καινοτομίες όπως την φιλοσοφία, τη ρητορική, τη δημοκρατία, τον Ολυμπισμό. Όλοι θυμόμαστε την «Αθήνα» που κατέκτησε την κατακτήτρια «Ρώμη» με τη γλώσσα και τις τέχνες της. Γιατί τέλος, η παγκόσμια κοινότητα είναι έτοιμη να δεχτεί την καινοτομία στο επίπεδο συσχετισμών Πολίτη-Συμπολίτη και Πολιτείας-Πολιτών όσο ποτέ άλλοτε στη σύγχρονη ιστορία της. Και γιατί ίσως η ιδέα Φιλότιμο, πρώτα ζυμωμένη μεταξύ Ελλήνων, αποτελέσει φάρο νοήματος και για τους «έξω». Η ΠρωτοβουλίαΗ Πρωτοβουλία #Philotimo ξεκίνησε από το Λονδίνο το 2011, με τη συνειδητοποίηση του ερευνητικού κενού στη σύγχρονη διεθνή βιβλιογραφία γύρω από την σύνθετη έννοια της λέξης Φιλότιμο την κεντρικότερη αξία της Ελληνικής πολιτισμικής ταυτότητας. Η ιδέα του να αναζητηθεί το «χαμένο φιλότιμο» όπως συχνά αναφέρεται, ξεκίνησε ένα συναρπαστικό ταξίδι με απίθανες συμπτώσεις και εποικοδομητικές συναντήσεις που οδήγησαν στην δημιουργία της μη-κερδοσκοπικής startup πλατφόρμας σκέψης/δράσης «Φιλότιμο Ίδρυμα» τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2014.Αποτελούμαστε από μια διεθνή ομάδα φίλων, εξειδικευμένων σε πεδία μεταξύ άλλων της ψυχολογίας και των κοινωνικών επιστημών, του μάρκετινγκ, της ιατρικής, της στατιστικής επιστήμης και της επιστήμης υπολογιστών, όπου ένωσε γύρω από αυτό τον σκοπό τις ιδέες, τις δυνάμεις και τις οικονομίες της. Ξεκινήσαμε τη συλλογή δεδομένων γύρω από ορισμούς και ιστορίες για το Φιλότιμο μέσα από τη διεθνή κοινότητα Ελλήνων. Σύντομα διαπιστώσαμε την κεντρικότητα της έννοιας στην κοινωνική συνοχή και την αγωγή του πολίτη εντός Ελλάδας αλλά και διεθνώς. Η Αποστολή Το Φιλότιμο είναι μια λέξη που δεν μπορεί να αναπαραχθεί από το «σύστημα». Επάνω στην οποία όμως αυτό βασίζεται στις κρισιμότερες ώρες για να επιβιώσει και να ανανεωθεί.Πιστεύουμε ότι το κλίμα σήμερα στην Ελλάδα και τον κόσμο ευνοεί για να ξεκινήσει ένας διάλογος γύρω από το τι είναι καλό και ωφέλιμο για την κοινωνία και την ανθρωπότητα, και τί όχι. Είναι ίσως η κρισιμότερη στιγμή για να εισαγάγουμε τη λέξη #PHILOTIMO στον κόσμο ως το αντίδοτο απέναντι σε λέξεις όπως την Μετά-Αλήθεια, την Ξενοφοβία και την ιδέα ενός Σουρεαλιστικού κόσμου (έννοιες που διακρίθηκαν στα διεθνή λεξικά το 2016).Αποστολή μας να κάνουμε το πρώτο βήμα ανάδειξης της λέξης παγκοσμίως με την εισαγωγή της στα διεθνή λεξικά (ενδεχομένως ακριβώς κάτω από τη λέξη ‘Φιλοσοφία’), παρακινώντας ένα διεθνές κίνημα ανάδειξής της ως μία από τις νέες λέξεις του 2017!Επιπλέον σκοπός μας η προεργασία διεθνούς Ντοκιμαντέρ γύρω από την ιστορία, τη θεωρία, την επιστήμη και το κοινωνικό κεφάλαιο του ‘Φιλότιμου’ με τη συνδρομή της πολυαγαπημένης εταιρείας παραγωγών “Indigo View"" («Το Νησί», «Η Λέξη Που Δε Λες»). Τέλος, αποσκοπούμε στην ανάπτυξη τεκμηριωμένων εφαρμογών διερεύνησης και καλλιέργειας της έννοιας και πρακτικής του φιλότιμου μέσα σε περιβάλλοντα όπως τον εκπαιδευτικό και εργασιακό τομέα, και τις σχέσεις πολιτείας-πολίτη. Πώς μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε Έως και τις 27 Ιανουαρίου 2017 μπορείτε να μας ενισχύσετε με ένα ποσό, μικρό όσο 2 ευρώ (περίπου $3) ή ανάλογο των δυνατοτήτων σας, μέσα από την πλατφόρμα συμμετοχικής χρηματοδότησης IndieGoGo (https://igg.me/at/philotimo). Από την πλευρά μας δεσμευόμαστε ότι θα γνωρίζετε ανά πάσα στιγμή που πήγε μέχρι και το τελευταίο ευρώ. Ως επιβράβευση των συνδρομών προσφέρουμε δώρα όπως ένα Μεγάλο Ευχαριστώ στα κοινωνικά μας δίκτυα, την ονομαστική αναφορά συνδρομητών στο Ντοκιμαντέρ ‘Φιλότιμο’, μπλουζάκια της καμπάνιας #PHILOTIMO, συμμετοχή στο καλοκαιρινό καταφύγιο ‘Philotimo Retreat’ και στο επιμορφωτικό εταιρικό σεμινάριο Phi.Lo.Ti.Mo. διαμορφωμένο από τους ειδικούς της ομάδας μας.Αν δεν έχετε τη δυνατότητα να μας στηρίξετε οικονομικά, σας ζητάμε να χρησιμοποιήσετε την ετικέτα #PHILOTIMO στα κοινωνικά σας δίκτυα όσο συχνότερα μπορείτε για να μοιραστείτε σκέψεις, συναισθήματα και ιστορίες γύρω από το Φιλότιμο, και έτσι να γίνετε συνοδοιπόροι στην εκστρατεία διάδοσης της λέξης.Κάθε μορφή βοήθειας από τις παραπάνω είναι εξίσου σημαντική και πολύτιμη.Υπεράνω όλων, θα λάβετε την προσωπική ικανοποίηση και την αναγνώριση από όλους εμάς για τη συμμετοχή σας σε αυτό το μοναδικό διεθνές κίνημα για να αλλάξουμε λίγο τον κόσμο, μια φιλότιμη χειρονομία τη φορά.Ας κάνουμε μαζί το #PHILOTIMO τη λέξη που πρέπει να λες, τη λέξη που όλος ο κόσμος θα πρέπει να λέει!Μόνο μαζί μπορούμε.Φιλότιμο Ίδρυμαwww.philotimo.orgwww.facebook.com/philotimon-------------------------------------------------------THE STORYThe Philotimo Initiative began in London in 2011, following the realization of a research gap within international bibliography around the complex concept of “philotimo”- a concept central to Greek cultural identity. The idea to explore the “lost philotimo,” as it’s often referred to by Greeks, began an fascinating journey of improbable coincidences and illumined encounters that led to the incorporation of the non-profit Think/Do startup ""Philotimo Foundation” in September 2014.We are an international group of friends, experts in our respective fields ranging from psychology to marketing, statistical and computer science. We began by collecting data and engaging the international community of Greeks to help us redefine the world ‘philotimo’ in the 21st century (think of it like citizenship, or moral judgment, they are both time and place specific). The more data we gathered, the more certain we became of #PHILOTIMO’s centrality in what constitutes 'social glue' and good citizenship today. THE MISSION Philotimo is a word that can’t be reproduced by the “system” , upon which the system however relies in its darkest hour to be revived and renewed.We believe that there couldn’t be better timing for the need to engage in an open dialogue around what constitutes good and what not for society. No better timing to introduce a word like #PHILOTIMO to the world as the antidote to words such as Post-Truth, Xenophobia and the sense of living in a Surreal world!With your support we will be able to take the first steps in gaining momentum for Philotimo and petition its entry across international dictionaries, possibly right under the word ‘Philosophy’,  and spread its meaning globally hoping to create a world trend by the end of 2017.Furthermore, you will be helping us initiate the production of a Feature Documentary on the history, theory, science and social capital of philotimo, featuring expert personalities across cultures and disciplines. A partner in this will be the highly acclaimed production team of “Indigo View"" ! What We Need & What You GetWe ask you to contribute as much as you can afford starting from $3 (~ €2), and we promise you will know how we've spent your money right to the last penny!

<h3>The Impact</h3>For the longest time, bots have dominated the MTGO trading landscape.  There are a handful of bot owners who maintain a list of buy and sell offers for many of the cards on MTGO.  Trading and liquidity has improved since bots entered the marketplace, but the average player was left at a distinct disadvantage.</div><div><br/></div><div>

</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Human traders should not automatically be at a disadvantage in the marketplace due to the lack of a micro-currency.

<p>By moving trading from the MTGO game client to the web, MOXchange has been able to solve all of the major problems that have plagued MTGO players for years. MOXchange bots let players deposit and withdraw cards and tickets between their MTGO and MOXchange accounts quickly and efficiently.  From the website, players can set buy and sell offers all the way down to 0.002 tickets on any items they'd like, or they can choose to accept the offers that others have posted.  Since MOXchange gathers all of the buy and sell offers in one centralized place, we're able to sort them and display only the very best price in our network at any time. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>In today’s global economy, having more than
one fluent language under your belt isn’t just a nice add-on to your resume.
Second language acquisition can make or break your chance to get a foothold in
many job industries. Every day, millions of consumers search the internet for
sites and services that allow them to practice language skills from the comfort
of their own homes. For many, learning a new language can be a daunting task,
not to mention an expensive one! Most of us can’t afford to run off to a
foreign country for months at a time, immersing ourselves in the language in
order to become fluent in a new language. And yet, the best way to learn a new
language is to converse, live, with someone who is already a native or fluent
speaker.  How can you do that with
today’s hectic work and life schedules?</p>
<p>The way we communicate as people has
changed as we become more and more dependent on the internet, but that need to
communicate with someone in real-time to learn language skills hasn’t changed.
We created We-Speek to help people all over the world learn a new language, all

<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Literacy ends poverty.</b> Most children and families in poverty have <b>zero </b>books at home or school. This is true across America and in every village in every nation on Earth. <b>You have the solution in your hands right now to fix this</b>. <i>With titles for every reading age, interest, and language, favorite magazines and comics are the most powerful literacy engines on the planet. <b>Everything begins with reading</b></i>.</p><p><b>We need your financial donation now to fund MagazineLiteracy.org operations</b> - we are a 501(c)(3) charitable organization - the first and only global, industry-wide literacy mission. <strong></strong>We need every person and every company to believe in our campaign to end illiteracy and poverty. <b>Donate now to make it so</b>.<br/></p>
<hr/>
<h3><strong>iMAGine literacy and make it so.</strong></h3>
<p><span><b>iMAGine what magazines and comics can do to end poverty</b>. Literacy
 is the most powerful force for prosperity, freedom, peace, and 
civility. A child unable to read is a child lost. Adults unable to read 
were once children who didn't learn how. Reading is where it all begins.
 Reading materials at home significantly contribute to academic 
achievement and readiness for life.</span></p>
<p><span><b>MagazineLiteracy.org</b> - the first-ever, global, industry-wide literacy campaign - resonates passionately with everyone who loves magazines and comics. Your financial support enables us to run our project and to conduct the outreach and logistics that get favorite magazines and comics into the hands, homes, and hearts of tens of millions of at-risk children, teens, and adults who are eager to learn and love to read.</span><br/></p>
<p>When we join together to iMAGine the change we can make in the world, we make it so - this is our moonshot, and <b>we need you and everyone who loves to write, edit, publish, and deliver magazines and comics to believe in our mission and to be onboard with a financial investment</b>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span><strong>Why your personal support for our literacy operations is so meaningful:</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>According to <i>Reading is Fundamental (RIF)</i>, two-thirds of America’s children living in poverty - 12 million+ kids - have no books at home - zero. Studies show that children in poverty hear 30 million fewer words as infants when their brains are developing for life. </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your financial support means we can change that today.</b></p>
<p><span><span>Each night, 35,000+ women - many moms with children leave everything they know behind to seek the safety of a domestic abuse shelter. </span></span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your financial support enables us to comfort them tonight with the magazines and comics you love. </b></p>
<p><span><span>Across America, hidden in every community are over 1 million homeless students. You know the power of reading magazines and comics - what it has meant to you. </span></span><b>Your financial support today enables us to give homeless students the gift of favorite magazines and comics to inspire hope for tomorrow.</b></p>
<p><span>MagazineLiteracy.org provides new and recycled magazines and comics to at-risk readers via mentoring and job training programs, shelters and food pantries, and foster care. We have set a goal to provide every mom and child in every domestic abuse shelter with a magazine to comfort them. We inspire enthusiasts to share the magazines and comics they love with children in sports and other mentoring programs, creating a bond between mentors and readers around common interests. We are setting up newsstands in food pantries to feed children and families hungry to read, and supply culinary magazines to unemployed and homeless people learning new skills in chef and food service job training programs.</span></p>

<h3><strong>How we put magazines and comics into the hands, homes, and hearts of at-risk readers:</strong></h3>
<p>Community donations are used to <b>buy bulk copies and subscriptions</b> for at-risk readers at mentoring and job training programs, shelters and food pantries, foster care, and other community literacy programs.  <b>100% of these community program funds get magazines and comics into the hands and homes of at-risk readers.</b> Generous financial commitments range from $25 - $10,000+ to support literacy needs with new and recycled magazines and comics.</p>
<hr/>
<p><span>Consumers <b>buy gift subscriptions</b> for at-risk readers in literacy programs - fueled by circulation promotions.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span>Consumers, students, businesses, and publishers <b>recycle</b> their magazines from home, work, school, and back issues from throughout the supply chain for literacy.</span></p>
<hr/>
<p><span>Consumers <b>buy newsstand magazines</b> collected for literacy at the point of sale.</span></p>

<p><strong>Homeless Women's Shelter</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>""We LOVE this program. We have found so many ways to share these wonderful magazines... Women are able to relax before class with a magazine... We have shared the magazines with all of the families that come here... We've never had magazines to give away in the past, so we are excited about that. I've used the magazines in a group called ""Women Leading Through Reading"" - a small group of women who get together every week to read about issues important to them. We use books too, but the magazines are nice because they also have pictures! Like I've said before, magazines are so attractive and less threatening than books, so readers at all levels will pick one up.""</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Boys and Girls Club</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>""The magazines have enriched our Education Center, our Reading Buddies program and recreational time for our members. We are so appreciative to have these magazines, and the ownership the kids can take really encourages them to read more.""</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Homeless Family Shelter</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>""The first day Anthony received his magazine he said, 'Wow!' 'Cool!' He began to start reading as soon as he picked the magazine. I was so surprised to see him reading, because he always told me how much he hates to read. About two days later, Anthony told me how he would read his magazine at school during quiet time, and he would let his friends read the magazines also. Anthony reads to his 3 year old sister more often, and now he is comfortable reading out loud.""</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Domestic Violence Shelter</strong></p>

When motivated, these students have a greater incentive to learn and practice good reading strategies. The magazines provide this motivation. Our students are able to take these high interest magazines home to read and enjoy thereby increasing their reading skills. They also share them with their families, which produces additional benefit.""</p></blockquote>

Literacy ends poverty. Most children and families in poverty have zero books at home or school. This is true across America and in every village in every nation on Earth. You have the solution in your hands right now to fix this. With titles for every reading age, interest, and language, favorite magazines and comics are the most powerful literacy engines on the planet. Everything begins with reading.We need your financial donation now to fund MagazineLiteracy.org operations - we are a 501(c)(3) charitable organization - the first and only global, industry-wide literacy mission. We need every person and every company to believe in our campaign to end illiteracy and poverty. Donate now to make it so.

iMAGine literacy and make it so.
iMAGine what magazines and comics can do to end poverty. Literacy
 is the most powerful force for prosperity, freedom, peace, and 
civility. A child unable to read is a child lost. Adults unable to read 
were once children who didn't learn how. Reading is where it all begins.
 Reading materials at home significantly contribute to academic 
achievement and readiness for life.
MagazineLiteracy.org - the first-ever, global, industry-wide literacy campaign - resonates passionately with everyone who loves magazines and comics. Your financial support enables us to run our project and to conduct the outreach and logistics that get favorite magazines and comics into the hands, homes, and hearts of tens of millions of at-risk children, teens, and adults who are eager to learn and love to read.
When we join together to iMAGine the change we can make in the world, we make it so - this is our moonshot, and we need you and everyone who loves to write, edit, publish, and deliver magazines and comics to believe in our mission and to be onboard with a financial investment.

Why your personal support for our literacy operations is so meaningful:
According to Reading is Fundamental (RIF), two-thirds of America’s children living in poverty - 12 million+ kids - have no books at home - zero. Studies show that children in poverty hear 30 million fewer words as infants when their brains are developing for life. Your financial support means we can change that today.
Each night, 35,000+ women - many moms with children leave everything they know behind to seek the safety of a domestic abuse shelter. Your financial support enables us to comfort them tonight with the magazines and comics you love. 
Across America, hidden in every community are over 1 million homeless students. You know the power of reading magazines and comics - what it has meant to you. Your financial support today enables us to give homeless students the gift of favorite magazines and comics to inspire hope for tomorrow.
MagazineLiteracy.org provides new and recycled magazines and comics to at-risk readers via mentoring and job training programs, shelters and food pantries, and foster care. We have set a goal to provide every mom and child in every domestic abuse shelter with a magazine to comfort them. We inspire enthusiasts to share the magazines and comics they love with children in sports and other mentoring programs, creating a bond between mentors and readers around common interests. We are setting up newsstands in food pantries to feed children and families hungry to read, and supply culinary magazines to unemployed and homeless people learning new skills in chef and food service job training programs.


Be a superhero. Power-up our operations.
We need you and every single person who loves magazines and comics to believe in MagazineLiteracy.org and to make a personal financial commitment to fund our operations today. MagazineLiteracy.org is the only project of its kind in the world. We must raise funds for two things - programs and operations:

100% of community donations are used to send new and recycled magazines to at-risk readers via literacy programs - these are our program expenses.

This industry campaign that you are supporting today specifically finances the outreach, operations, and logistics that are the foundation of our distribution to literacy programs - recruiting literacy agencies; mobilizing and supporting a massive network of volunteers in communities across the U.S. and worldwide - our ambassadors and change agents; and maintaining the technology that matches literacy wishlists to magazines and comics.



Every dollar counts. We need your support to achieve our goal of 100% industry participation.
A juggernaut is a force, campaign, or movement that is extremely large and powerful and cannot be stopped - with your support right now, we can be all these things and more. iMAGine the possibilities and make them so with your donation.Multiply your impact, by sharing this campaign and asking your friends and colleagues to support our mission too.

Here's why magazines and comics are the most powerful literacy engines on the planet:
There are magazines and comics for every reading level, interest, and language.
Magazines and comics educate, inspire, and entertain.
Magazines and comics hold our attention, igniting iMAGination.
Magazines and comics give regular, timely, and timeless information.
Magazines and comics foster ownership and build self-esteem.
Magazines and comics connect readers and mentors around common interests.
Magazines and comics are familiar and not intimidating.
Magazines and comics are engagingly beautiful.
Magazines and comics are inspirational and aspirational.
People of all ages love to read and share magazines and comics.

How we put magazines and comics into the hands, homes, and hearts of at-risk readers:
Community donations are used to buy bulk copies and subscriptions for at-risk readers at mentoring and job training programs, shelters and food pantries, foster care, and other community literacy programs.  100% of these community program funds get magazines and comics into the hands and homes of at-risk readers. Generous financial commitments range from $25 - $10,000+ to support literacy needs with new and recycled magazines and comics.

Consumers buy gift subscriptions for at-risk readers in literacy programs - fueled by circulation promotions.

Consumers, students, businesses, and publishers recycle their magazines from home, work, school, and back issues from throughout the supply chain for literacy.

Consumers buy newsstand magazines collected for literacy at the point of sale.


We need your support to reach tens of millions of eager readers coast to coast and worldwide.
We are already sending new and recycled magazines to hundreds of thousands of readers, but millions more are waiting, We've opened a global literacy operations center in Trenton, New Jersey and global literacy outreach center in Madison, Wisconsin to mobilize tens of thousands of volunteers to support hundreds of thousands of literacy programs to reach tens of millions of readers, worldwide. With access to tens of millions of magazines and comics ready for eager readers, we are at the center of the largest literacy opportunity in the world. These success stories illustrate the power of engaging people who love magazines to support literacy:

Employees at a software company donated $11,000 to send Highlights magazines to 90 Ohio elementary school children for three years.

A sales training company in Ohio sent Spider magazine to two classrooms.

Prince Sports sent Tennis and Smash magazines to 200 kids in a Boston tennis mentoring program.

A Subway Sandwich Shop owner sent Time for Kids to 60 children in a Harlem after-school program. WoodenBoat and Fine Woodworking magazines were sent to a boatbuilding youth mentoring program in the Bronx.

Employees at an Indiana company donated $12,000 over three years to send children’s magazines to 800 elementary school children in an after-school mentoring program operated on 20 college campuses.

A team of Canadian companies, families, and schools airlifted 2,000+ magazines to Inuit children and families north of the Arctic Circle. Lacrosse magazines were sent to a team forming in Croatia. Thousands of magazines have been requested by schools from Detroit to Sri Lanka.

A large publisher shipped 40,000 children’s magazines to all the Head Start programs in Mississippi after Katrina. We delivered 150,000 children's magazines to a large food bank serving over 900,000 people in areas hardest hit by superstorm Sandy.

Highlights conducted a social media campaign and supplied 52,000 publications for literacy. Cobblestone/Cricket  supplied 10,000 children’s magazines for eager readers. Conde Nast, Time Inc., Hearst, Meredith, National Geographic and others have sent millions of magazines to our global operations center where they are flowing to meet literacy needs.

Quad/Graphics has been instrumental moving truckloads of magazines through our supply chain. Sappi Paper, Quint & Quint, Ryleco, the Greg Barber Company, the Majeski Foundation, Comag, PSCS Consulting, and others have supplied mission critical support. We are blessed having the MPA, PBAA, FIPP, Folio:, Linda Ruth, and Mr. Magazine - Samir Husni telling our amazing stories to the world.

Our first magazine recycling project was organized by a kindergarten class in San Francisco for children in a nearby homeless shelter. We are setting up newsstands in food pantries to feed children and families hungry to read. We  have set a goal to send a new gift magazine to every mom and child in every domestic abuse shelter.

We are recruiting thousands of volunteers to serve as literacy ambassadors across the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the South Seas.

A NJ Boy Scout earned his Eagle rank organizing our first supermarket magazine drive, and Girl Scouts organize Silver Award literacy projects. An Indiana 11-year-old collected and shipped us 200 pounds of magazines for literacy. A High School team collected 2,000 magazines for literacy programs. Magazine drives have been organized at New York University, Arizona State, the University of Wisconsin, Cornell University, Rowan University, UCLA and many more college campuses.

Operations funders like you are our angels.
We need your financial investment to underwrite the operations, technology, outreach, and logistics that form the foundation of our massive literacy mission.By funding operations only with dollars from angels like you, we cankeep our promise forever that 100% of community donations deliver magazines and comics to literacy agencies for at-risk readers.""Our passion is to build an enormous literacy pipeline and to challenge the citizens of the world to fill it with the wonderful magazines we love - to share them with new readers. With your support, we can put favorite magazines into the hands, homes, and hearts of millions of readers.""

Our impact:
Homeless Women's Shelter
""We LOVE this program. We have found so many ways to share these wonderful magazines... Women are able to relax before class with a magazine... We have shared the magazines with all of the families that come here... We've never had magazines to give away in the past, so we are excited about that. I've used the magazines in a group called ""Women Leading Through Reading"" - a small group of women who get together every week to read about issues important to them. We use books too, but the magazines are nice because they also have pictures! Like I've said before, magazines are so attractive and less threatening than books, so readers at all levels will pick one up.""
Boys and Girls Club
""The magazines have enriched our Education Center, our Reading Buddies program and recreational time for our members. We are so appreciative to have these magazines, and the ownership the kids can take really encourages them to read more.""
Homeless Family Shelter
""The first day Anthony received his magazine he said, 'Wow!' 'Cool!' He began to start reading as soon as he picked the magazine. I was so surprised to see him reading, because he always told me how much he hates to read. About two days later, Anthony told me how he would read his magazine at school during quiet time, and he would let his friends read the magazines also. Anthony reads to his 3 year old sister more often, and now he is comfortable reading out loud.""
Domestic Violence Shelter
""We serve 35 to 50 children each day. Our children are almost always behind grade and culturally deprived. Therefore, we emphasize reading and learning experiences with them and their mothers... we are interested in securing magazines that we can use here and want to give each child, when he or she leaves, an age appropriate magazine subscription.""

 A few months ago, a woman who I know through my church shared her experience with me of traveling to Haiti to help young mothers.

I started looking for a way I could have a similar experience, and I found  ""Humanitarian Experience for Youth,"" and I decided to jump aboard.


Humanitarian Experience for Youth offers trips to fifteen different destinations that are in need of humanitarian work. I was drawn to Cuenca, Ecuador because I will have the unique opportunity to interact with and care for orphaned children who have special needs.




Who will I get to serve? In Ecuador, I, along with a handful of other youth, will be working in the  colonial city of Cuenca. There are many disadvantaged children who have disabilities in Cuenca and other surrounding towns. Many of them were orphaned from a young age, but very few organizations are available to serve these children. I am excited to spend time with and get to know these children.



What will I do? For this project, we will be building new housing facilities at an orphanage that primarily serves severely disabled and disadvantaged children. This will allow the orphanage volunteers to be available to the children and will provide increased support for children in need. I will have the unique opportunity to see the children each day at the work site and volunteer in the orphanage twice a week. During the week days, we will be serving the locals, and on the weekends, I will have the chance to explore some of the scenery of Ecuador.


Why is this important to me? Because my family has adopted three children from China (two of whom have special needs) I have a special place in my heart for children with special needs.  I believe that in order for children to progress, they need love, and I am excited that I have the opportunity to spend time with the children in Ecuador and give them that chance to feel loved.

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>It was always important to my mother that her children be surrounded by positive representation of Blackness. From dolls to Christmas ornaments to art. I thought she was nuts...then I became a mother and I realized what she had done for me and why representation was so important. Black greatness was normalized for me so growing up instead of me wondering if I was capable of achieving something, the question was more, why wouldn't I be capable. Through normalizing greatness, my mother instilled a confidence in me that the world couldn't break. It wasn't until I was an adult that I realized how special my experience was. It is now my mission to do that for other children. </p>
<ul><li>Brown Toy Box launched in 2016 as a subscription box curating culturally affirming products for Black children. In 2018 we realized we need to be more focused, we weren't addressing a bigger issue. While it is still very important that our boxes are culturally affirming and builds confidence, we needed the boxes to be more purposeful.  We took a hard look at the tech industry, science, and all other areas of STEAM and recognized there was a major gap in what the diversity of America looks like compared to the diversity in these industries. We asked ourselves how can we instill  confidence, curiosity, and capabilities to engage in learning about STEAM. We are determined to make STEAM accessible, representative and fun. </li></ul>

<p>We relaunched the box to meet three goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure Black children saw people that look like them positively represented in the STEAM driving the US economy and that will be the high paying jobs of the future.</li>
<li>To use fun and play to expose them early and often to activities and experiments that instills confidence in the abilities and a curiosity to learn and do more.</li>
<li>Encourage parental participation. Not enough can be said about the important role parental involvement plays in the success of young students. We want the box experience to be one that takes the intimidation of of STEAM making it more accessible. Ultimately activating parents as advocates of STEAM immersion for their children throughout their academic careers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have always known that some of the best and brightest young scholars who would benefit from our boxes the most, would come from families that could afford them the least, which is why in addition to our existing monthly direct to consumer subscription box, we continue to pilot programs and partnerships in Title 1 schools.</p>
<p><br/>We know the need is national, actually global, but Atlanta is our backyard and we wanted to partner to support a nonprofit right here at home in celebration of back to school. </p>

We, as their mothers, look on partially monitoring any possible dangerous situations that may come up or any moments that might require our intervention. We also look on in the hopes that all the work we have done in our lives, in our spiritual, cultural, and social justice journeys will have an impact on their lives as well. We hope to impart all the lessons we have learned along the way with them, so that they might be grounded in the things we as children found ourselves desperately looking for. We hope they have a nuanced understanding of their ancestral culture, of complex and deep spirituality, of the structural inequality that impact their ability to move in the world. We also hope that like us they feel the call toward social justice work, recognizing that we can contribute to change in even the smallest of ways and in everything we do.</p><p>As educators, academics, mothers, Latinas, socially aware and radicalized human beings we situate this work in a critique of this country’s traditional schooling system as entrenched in systems of power meant to perpetuate a patriarchal, white supremacist, capitalist ideology; meant to marginalize and oppress people who are not white, cisgender, men, thin and able bodied. We recognize the long history of colonization in our country that perpetuated violence, slavery, and genocide on our ancestors, and our cultural histories. Yet, we have hope that we can offer our children the possibilities for a different world, the space to imagine true liberation and freedom. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568148678/uja5wauhjjhlhhhqmcyj.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Photo credit: Carolina Adame Photography<br/> </p><p><strong>Celebrating Our Culture</strong></p><p>Our book celebrates the traditions, customs and stories of our ancestors, who are mostly of Mexican and/or American indigenous ancestry.

Thus, this book is born out of a desperate need to intentionally reclaim and celebrate our culture. In a world so often centered in the white Anglo-American experience this book works to resist those oppressive representations. We do this by highlighting the beauty and importance of the wisdom of our ancestors as a way to resist erasure, oppression and ultimately set us on a path of liberation.

Anzaldua and Maya Christina Gonzalez Photo credit: Carolina Adame PhotographySemillas de las Abuelas is birthed from our beliefs that we, as mothers, are healers that are healing as well as nurturers that need nurturing!  We are teachers that are learning!  Whatever mothering you do, we want you to feel loved and appreciated!Photo credit: Carolina Adame Photography Our InspirationOur children play together, they learn how to interact, they learn social skills, they learn conflict resolution, and they learn emotional literacy through play. We, as their mothers, look on partially monitoring any possible dangerous situations that may come up or any moments that might require our intervention. We also look on in the hopes that all the work we have done in our lives, in our spiritual, cultural, and social justice journeys will have an impact on their lives as well. We hope to impart all the lessons we have learned along the way with them, so that they might be grounded in the things we as children found ourselves desperately looking for. We hope they have a nuanced understanding of their ancestral culture, of complex and deep spirituality, of the structural inequality that impact their ability to move in the world. We also hope that like us they feel the call toward social justice work, recognizing that we can contribute to change in even the smallest of ways and in everything we do.As educators, academics, mothers, Latinas, socially aware and radicalized human beings we situate this work in a critique of this country’s traditional schooling system as entrenched in systems of power meant to perpetuate a patriarchal, white supremacist, capitalist ideology; meant to marginalize and oppress people who are not white, cisgender, men, thin and able bodied. We recognize the long history of colonization in our country that perpetuated violence, slavery, and genocide on our ancestors, and our cultural histories. Yet, we have hope that we can offer our children the possibilities for a different world, the space to imagine true liberation and freedom. Photo credit: Carolina Adame Photography Celebrating Our CultureOur book celebrates the traditions, customs and stories of our ancestors, who are mostly of Mexican and/or American indigenous ancestry. We acknowledge the ways in which colonization and white supremacy sought to erase or otherwise suppress our ancestral ways of living and knowing. Thus, this book is born out of a desperate need to intentionally reclaim and celebrate our culture. In a world so often centered in the white Anglo-American experience this book works to resist those oppressive representations. We do this by highlighting the beauty and importance of the wisdom of our ancestors as a way to resist erasure, oppression and ultimately set us on a path of liberation. We must tell our stories, write them down, ensure their place in history, and secure them for the future generations.Photo credit: Carolina Adame Photography Who is This Book For?Though we recognize the historical, geographical, sociopolitical, and cultural differences among the peoples from the different countries of the Americas marked by Spanish colonization, we also recognize the similarities in our traditions and customs, with other Latinx or indigenous ancestries. Thus, our book is meant to serve as a template for those looking to bring earth based rhythms into your families from a cultural perspective. We also acknowledge those families who might have been disconnected from their culture for one reason or another, and we hope this book can help to reconnect you with your roots so that you might be able to pass them on to your children.Photo credit: Carolina Adame Photography About the BookSemillas de las Abuelas is a foundational resource book filled with songs, rhymes, recipes, stories and ideas for rituals and rhythms passed down to us by our Abuelas and other ancestors. This book is for new parents and for those already grounded in family life with a desire to integrate these practices and traditions into your own homes to create connections to the earth, to our families and to our culture. This book aims to inspire creative growth and deepen our intentions!Semillas de las Abuelas consists of seven chapters that take you through the arc of the day and the seasons of the year.

<p>There are hundreds of intergovernmental (or international governmental organizations – IGOs) on the planet. Without a doubt, the most famous of these is the United Nations (UN) and its various specialized agencies, funds, and programs (such as UNICEF, UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, IMF, the World Bank Group and FAO, etc.) but there are several others of importance.</p>
<p>These organizations are created by two or more sovereign states or other intergovernmental organizations and carry out work which is highly relevant in a wide range of fields, such as security, human rights, integration, trade, technology, childhood, health, international development, aviation, and housing, among so many others.</p>
<p>Working at these organizations means making an important social impact on the world. It means being in a multicultural environment, with incredible people from all over the planet; it means experiencing daily challenges and achievements; it means earning a good salary and benefits; it means traveling and knowing a little more about the world… It is a dream for many people.</p>
<p>However, there is still a lack of knowledge about how to enter these organizations and difficulty in accessing information about the different recruitment and selection processes. The OpenIGO network was created to change this situation.</p>
<p>OpenIGO is an extensive network formed of professors and researchers from the best universities in the world, professionals from international organizations and Human Resources specialists, which has the following strategic plan:</p>

<p>Taking an internship at the United Nations (UN) and their different funds, programs and agencies (such as UNICEF, TheWorld Bank, IMF, FAO, WHO, and so many others) is a dream for millions of young people around the world. More than a professional opportunity, a UN internship is a fantastic life experience. Some of the reasons for taking a UN internship are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>The UN system offers thousands of internships every year. However, being selected is not an easy task. </strong>Millions of young people around the world are competing for these vacancies. It is essential that candidates meet all of the internship program’s minimum requirements, in order to become one of the selected few. However, this is not everything. It is acknowledged that people who have connections with United Nations staff have advantages in the different internship selection processes. This is not because there are predetermined candidates. The United Nations is a serious organization. However, since these people have prior knowledge, which facilitates their navigation through the complex United Nations System, they are better prepared for the competitive internship selection processes. In other words, the asymmetry of the information about UN internships benefits those who have knowledge of this system.</p>
<p><strong>OpenIGO seeks to tackle this problem. We are developing and disseminating information that significantly increases your chances of landing an internship in the UN system. By doing this, we are seeking greater democratization of internship and work opportunities, which results in a more representative and fairer international system.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558113939/cfheqoefeky5bc7iglcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The UN is a complex system formed by dozens of international organizations. Generally speaking, each one of these organizations has an internship search system and its own program. It is extremely time-consuming for candidates to hunt for these internships and jobs.</p>
<p>In order to simplify this process, OpenIGO has developed robots that collate all the internship and job opportunities in the UN system in a single system but we need to make even further progress.</p>
<p>Our aim is that the OpenIGO system makes the match between the interested parties and the candidate profile with the professional vacancy that an international organization is offering. The candidate will be advised by email of all the new UN vacancies and at other international organizations that correspond with their profile.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will have a complete system: which collates all the job and internship opportunities in the UN system in a single place and, in addition, sends these by email to those matching the profiles, making the hunt for internships and jobs much easier.</p>
<p><strong>For those who contribute towards our initiative, we offer unlimited access to the internship and job system.</strong></p>

Without a doubt, the most famous of these is the United Nations (UN) and its various specialized agencies, funds, and programs (such as UNICEF, UNDP, UNEP, UNFPA, IMF, the World Bank Group and FAO, etc.) but there are several others of importance.
These organizations are created by two or more sovereign states or other intergovernmental organizations and carry out work which is highly relevant in a wide range of fields, such as security, human rights, integration, trade, technology, childhood, health, international development, aviation, and housing, among so many others.
Working at these organizations means making an important social impact on the world. It means being in a multicultural environment, with incredible people from all over the planet; it means experiencing daily challenges and achievements; it means earning a good salary and benefits; it means traveling and knowing a little more about the world… It is a dream for many people.
However, there is still a lack of knowledge about how to enter these organizations and difficulty in accessing information about the different recruitment and selection processes. The OpenIGO network was created to change this situation.
OpenIGO is an extensive network formed of professors and researchers from the best universities in the world, professionals from international organizations and Human Resources specialists, which has the following strategic plan:

To contribute to developing international careers and democratizing recruitment and selection processes in the UN System and at other intergovernmental organizations by producing and disseminating advanced knowledge.

To be a reference in the world of producing and disseminating knowledge about careers and jobs in the UN System and at intergovernmental organizations.

OpenIGO’s focus is on international governmental organizations: bilateral and multilateral, regional and global, which work on varying topics.


Taking an internship at the United Nations (UN) and their different funds, programs and agencies (such as UNICEF, TheWorld Bank, IMF, FAO, WHO, and so many others) is a dream for millions of young people around the world. More than a professional opportunity, a UN internship is a fantastic life experience. Some of the reasons for taking a UN internship are as follows:

 
Receive a good stipend and benefits. It is true that some of the UN internships are unpaid. However, what many people do not know is there are also many paid internships at the UN, which offer benefits and stipends higher than those provided by the majority of companies.

 
 
Working an enjoyable, multicultural environment with incredible people from all around the world.
 
 

 
Work at organizations that have important missions in a wide range of international development areas, such as peacekeeping, health, childhood, agriculture, the environment, water, economic and social development, employment, gender, culture, and city planning, among many others.

 
 
Have a global impact. Your actions will help people in a wide range of locations around the world.
 

 
 
Make your curriculum stand out, with experience that is highly valued by the world of work.
 

 
 
Construct influential networks that you will retain for the rest of your life.
 

 
 
Experience daily challenges and achievements.
 

 
Learn or improve a foreign language. A UN internship is an excellent opportunity for professional experience abroad.
 

 
 
Travel and see different places around the world.
 

 
Constantly improve your qualifications. Intergovernmental organizations make large investments in training and updating their interns.

 
 
Expand your horizons. Taking an internship at an intergovernmental organization will provide experiences, which will change your way of seeing and understanding the world.
 
 
The UN system offers thousands of internships every year. However, being selected is not an easy task. Millions of young people around the world are competing for these vacancies. It is essential that candidates meet all of the internship program’s minimum requirements, in order to become one of the selected few. However, this is not everything. It is acknowledged that people who have connections with United Nations staff have advantages in the different internship selection processes. This is not because there are predetermined candidates. The United Nations is a serious organization. However, since these people have prior knowledge, which facilitates their navigation through the complex United Nations System, they are better prepared for the competitive internship selection processes. In other words, the asymmetry of the information about UN internships benefits those who have knowledge of this system.
OpenIGO seeks to tackle this problem. We are developing and disseminating information that significantly increases your chances of landing an internship in the UN system. By doing this, we are seeking greater democratization of internship and work opportunities, which results in a more representative and fairer international system.

With your help, we'll develop the following products and services:
 

The UN is a complex system formed by dozens of international organizations. Generally speaking, each one of these organizations has an internship search system and its own program. It is extremely time-consuming for candidates to hunt for these internships and jobs.
In order to simplify this process, OpenIGO has developed robots that collate all the internship and job opportunities in the UN system in a single system but we need to make even further progress.
Our aim is that the OpenIGO system makes the match between the interested parties and the candidate profile with the professional vacancy that an international organization is offering. The candidate will be advised by email of all the new UN vacancies and at other international organizations that correspond with their profile.
Therefore, we will have a complete system: which collates all the job and internship opportunities in the UN system in a single place and, in addition, sends these by email to those matching the profiles, making the hunt for internships and jobs much easier.
For those who contribute towards our initiative, we offer unlimited access to the internship and job system.

Imagine an e-book that teaches you everything you need to land a UN internship and be successful in it. Our team of Human Resources specialists, UN staff and university professors are now developing precisely that. The “United Nations System Internships: the complete guide” e-book will have 10 chapters, which will be of great assistance in helping you land the best internships in the UN system. It will have more than 160 pages, separated into the following chapters:
Chapter 1 – The UN System and intergovernmental organizations;
Chapter 2 – UN System internships: an overview;
Chapter 3 – Seeking the best internships in the UN System; 
Chapter 4 – Prepare perfect curricula and resumes for your UN internship;
Chapter 5 – Prepare an effective cover letter;
Chapter 6 – Write an outstanding letter of intent;
Chapter 7 – Have successful internship interviews at the UN;
Chapter 8 – Be prepared for your UN internship;
Chapter 9 – Stand out during your UN internship;
Chapter 10 – Successfully complete your UN internship.
The development of this book involves a large number of authors, technical and linguistic reviewers and designers, as well as other professionals.

As you know, although some of the UN System pays its interns well, unfortunately, there is still another part that does not. As an example, is the important UN Secretariat, based in expensive cities such as New York and Geneva, which completely excludes people who are not able to work for free, especially those from peripheral regions and countries. In other words, only a small elite is able to take internships at these organizations. As people who take internships in the UN System are able to find jobs more easily at this organization, the result is important international organizations, which are vital for good global governance, with elitist and undemocratic staff.
With the aim of contributing even further with the democratization of UN internship opportunities, the OpenIGO Network, with your help, will launch an extensive campaign to mobilize UN decision-makers, in the search to make them aware of the importance of paying interns throughout the system. The campaign will take place on social networks, in videos and electronic petitions. It will start to run on October 2019.

<p>We are Pukawin, a wellness inspired program presented by a collective of creative arts, dance, yoga, and holistic living instructors and educators from diverse backgrounds; Sharlene Aquilar, Michelle ""Mochi"" Camaya Julian, and LaMae Caparas.</p>
<p>('Pukawin’ in Tagalog means to inspire, excite, innervate, awaken, impassion).</p>
<p><strong>Pukawin Arts &amp; Wellness Program</strong> is the product of long-time friends who have worked together previously across both coasts of the US and internationally on community conscious projects and events including the Philippines. We have performed together in Broadway productions and various events and collaborated in educational and arts programs. As creative agents of change, entrepreneurs, award-winning performers, community organizers, educators and spiritual leaders, we hold a combined 50+ years of experience and expertise across multiple fields, and have synergistically integrated our complementary skills.</p>
<p>This March 2020, we want to travel to the Philippines and share our program with its communities, the first of which will be for <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/malasimbofestival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Malasimbo Music &amp; Arts Festival</a>, a two day celebration of music, life, spirit, earth, and freedom at La Mesa Eco Park in Quezon City, Philippines, as they host their 10-Year Anniversary.</p>
<p>Pukawin will present a unique and uplifting experience for all ages that will celebrate and honor the work of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Lopez"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gina Lopez</a> by introducing a wellness inspired program of yoga, dance, and eco workshops at Malasimbo to enhance the festival’s mission.</p>
<p>Gina Lopez was a Filipino yoga missionary, environmentalist and philanthropist known for spearheading notable environmental projects in the Philippines, including the reforestation of the La Mesa Watershed Reservation, the last remaining forest zone in Metro Manila, right where our program takes place. She was an advocate for corporate social responsibility, and received several awards including her most recent, 2017 Seacology Prize,  before passing away this past August 2019. Pukawin’s Yoga/Dance and Environmental Mindfulness workshop programs follow in the impactful footsteps of Gina Lopez and aim to reveal new skills to better serve oneself and the planet, refining ones practice, and finding enjoyment for a more compassionate, creative, and fulfilling life.</p>
<p><strong>Our program</strong> will expand on the arts &amp; wellness. Below are some descriptions to the workshops we will be offering.</p>
<p><strong>THE ARTS</strong></p>
<p>Sound Explorations: Explore music inspirations and its healing effects using various resonant tools, singing bowls from crystal to metal gong bowls, and musical instruments. </p>
<p>Wild Nature Movement Series: These workshops inspired by the natural world, meld a variety of disciplines that dissolve mind -body boundaries by cultivating deep curiosity, ultimate compassion, and empathy for oneself and for others. </p>
<p>Partner Dance: The introduction classes to this dance called the hustle will also incorporate traditional Filipino folk dancing while learning to interconnect with another, inspiring new levels of communication and freedom.</p> <p><strong>WELLNESS</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable Living &amp; Green Thumbing: Workshops that incorporate nature - related concepts and activities including mask making, composting, planting, vision boarding, and more. More sensorial and healing experiences are in exploring the relationship to the land to guide and inspire mindfulness, movement and lifestyle - in both present and ancestral connections.</p> <p>Nature &amp; Sound Bathing: Explore music inspirations and its healing effects using various resonant tools, singing bowls, and musical instruments as well as those found in nature. </p> <p>Yoga Guidance: Michelle Camaya Julian is the co-founder of the KAMOCHIMETHOD, a method which introduces 3 principles based on breath, alignment and vow. Their mission is to ignite and reinforce the circle of communication between the individual and the creative artist within. Her sessions are inspired by the natural and brilliant design of the human body, as she helps each person liberate their movement by increasing range of motion, flexibility and strength. Her classes are joyful &amp; light-hearted and practitioners come out of her sessions more structurally aware and ready to dance through life. </p>

<p> </p>

Wild Nature Movement Series: These workshops inspired by the natural world, meld a variety of disciplines that dissolve mind -body boundaries by cultivating deep curiosity, ultimate compassion, and empathy for oneself and for others. 
Partner Dance: The introduction classes to this dance called the hustle will also incorporate traditional Filipino folk dancing while learning to interconnect with another, inspiring new levels of communication and freedom. WELLNESS
Sustainable Living & Green Thumbing: Workshops that incorporate nature - related concepts and activities including mask making, composting, planting, vision boarding, and more. More sensorial and healing experiences are in exploring the relationship to the land to guide and inspire mindfulness, movement and lifestyle - in both present and ancestral connections. Nature & Sound Bathing: Explore music inspirations and its healing effects using various resonant tools, singing bowls, and musical instruments as well as those found in nature.  Yoga Guidance: Michelle Camaya Julian is the co-founder of the KAMOCHIMETHOD, a method which introduces 3 principles based on breath, alignment and vow. Their mission is to ignite and reinforce the circle of communication between the individual and the creative artist within. Her sessions are inspired by the natural and brilliant design of the human body, as she helps each person liberate their movement by increasing range of motion, flexibility and strength. Her classes are joyful & light-hearted and practitioners come out of her sessions more structurally aware and ready to dance through life. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
In order to ensure we cover every aspect of our program plan, we are looking to raise a total of $3,000 to help fund our mission to the Philippines, to Malasimbo Festival, and reaching other communities in need.
Your donation goes towards our in-land travels, N95 face masks, donations, and program supplies (print outs, mats, wellness giveaways, and signage).
We have some amazing wellness offerings for your donation!
From traditional Philippine 'pasalubong' gift baskets to virtual classes, sound healing, private yoga classes, to wellness packages, we have an abundant amount of perks to give back joy and inspiration for your donation.
 

The Impact
We are five females empowered by another women's story and her work as a yogi and environmentalist.
Philippines, which is the third leading producer of plastic pollution, needs all the help, information, and inspiration, it can get to start shifting in the direction of becoming more environmentally conscious.
 

Risks & Challenges
The risk is that we don't raise the money needed to get all our guides there. 
In that case, our lead guides will go and we are happy to find local instructors to collaborate with and substitute this time.
Our group is experienced in events and live theater and troubleshooting was a learned skill in those industries. We are very confident in facing and finding solutions to any challenge.
We aim to include more partnerships and venues into our program as we move forward in the fundraising of this campaign. Any leads or support is greatly appreciated!
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please share this campaign with all your family, friends, co-workers and acquaintances by using the share tools. 
Please share for corporate sponsorship, brands, and businesses that can contribute donations or supplies.
The more awareness we can get for our campaign the more donations, and the more people will learn about us and our shared missions.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>WHY this course? The short story…</b></span></p>
<p>In over 23 years of teaching I have seen so many examples of where things go wrong with learning to play guitar. You see, even though we’re all unique as a person, most of us make the same mistakes when trying to master an instrument. So in those years I’ve learned to, very efficiently and clearly, explain things to help you get past these stages quicker. </p>
<p>Next to my “analog offline teaching” I’ve been teaching songs in the digital realm of youtube for 5 years now, and I’ve reached more people through internet than here at home (11+ million views). Still, youtube is by far not the ideal learning environment the way it is set up. It is built to present ads, not to serve as a true learning tool. This is why I decided and started to bundle my wealth of “offline and online” teaching experience into this course that will be accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. It will feature the quality and environment that is essential for beginning guitarists.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

WHY this course? The short story…
In over 23 years of teaching I have seen so many examples of where things go wrong with learning to play guitar. You see, even though we’re all unique as a person, most of us make the same mistakes when trying to master an instrument. So in those years I’ve learned to, very efficiently and clearly, explain things to help you get past these stages quicker. 
Next to my “analog offline teaching” I’ve been teaching songs in the digital realm of youtube for 5 years now, and I’ve reached more people through internet than here at home (11+ million views). Still, youtube is by far not the ideal learning environment the way it is set up. It is built to present ads, not to serve as a true learning tool. This is why I decided and started to bundle my wealth of “offline and online” teaching experience into this course that will be accessible 24/7 from anywhere in the world. It will feature the quality and environment that is essential for beginning guitarists.
A selection of course features:

One time fee - Life Time Access*
Full HD video
Multi Camera angles & split screens for a birds eye view of what’s going on
Clear explanation and step by step instructions with on screen graphics
Well paced lessons
Logical lesson progression
300+ video tutorials and exercises
Option to be coached along side this course
Qualified teacher (bachelor & master)
No distractions & ad free
& more

*Under normal circumstances. No person or business can guarantee a lifetime of access to anything. Usually that is in the small print of the agreement. I don’t like small print so I put it here where it is easy to read :-)
BUDGET: Why would you need $6000?
Without beating around the bush, this is what the estimated costs are for the production of this course and its 300+ videos :
 

Video recording, compositing & editing: $5000
Audio mixing & mastering$250
Media (photo’s & artwork)$250
Indiegogo & Paypal Fees (approximately)$600
Taxes (estimated) $750
Total including Indiegogo & Paypal Fees: $6100
Total including Fees & taxes:  $6850

What do you need me for, don’t you have a job?
In fact, I had 2 jobs, but let me get to that in a bit… As I mentioned, I have been making free online lessons for 5 years. A total of 250 videos (most on youtube) that gathered almost 12 million views, and an additional 300K views/month. Those views get me a whopping $40/month! Wait…. WHAT?

</div></div>","You Can Make A Difference We invite you to participate in the creation of an illustrated story for children about the virtues of the Peruvian llama highlighting respect for the environment and promoting cultural pride. We will partner with schools to utilize this book as a tool to improve the lives of Andean families throughout the Sacred Valley of Peru.   The Campaign We are raising $7,500 to produce a 32 page illustrated story in Spanish, native Quechua, and English along with important educational reference pages that reinforces the importance of the llama for our culture and ecosystem.
The first 1,000 books will be given freely to local schools and to more than 700 families of High Andean communities.
Accompanying the publishing of the book will be a program of theatrical presentation introducing the story to children within the schools and community. This is key to ensure full family immersion and participation.
Another 1,000 books will be made available for sale in the Sacred Valley tourist industry and the proceeds from the sales will finance the creation of educational material to support ecological education programs in community schools.


Everyone who donates will have their name listed on a special donor page of the book and receive an electronic version of the book (your gift may also be recognized anonymously if you prefer).
Over $50 + shipping will receive a mailed hard copy of the book with a personal thank you note.
Over $100 will receive a mailed hard copy of the book with a personal thank you note.
Over $250 will also be eligible for a 3-night stay for 2 at the Llama Pack Hostel in Urubamba, Peru.
Over $500, in addition to the above, will have a book presented to a school or community in their name. A plaque with your name will accompany the presentation and we will send you a video of the presentation.
Over $2,500, in addition to everything mentioned, 2 people will also be able to participate in a Llama Pack Project Llama Trek to one of the communities benefiting from your donation.
Over $5,000..well, you get it all - including a visit to the Machu Picchu for 2!


Through a contest, we have found a wonderful illustrator and, once we have completed raising funds, full production will take 3 months. Our objective is to be working with families and schools by August, 2016.
If we do not reach our goal here, funds will be held and combined with those from other sources to ensure completion of the project. We, and our community, are committed to making this happen.
    The Impact The llama, a distinctively Peruvian unique pack animal, is capable of preserving High Andean ecosystems and precious sources of water while providing a source of revenue for the communities living there.
Llama Pack Project has been working to reintroduce the llama as a viable pack animal so that these families, currently living in poverty, may participate in the burgeoning tourist industry that is passing them by.

This story will plant the seed of pride and encourage children of these families to continue the tradition of becoming breeders of llamas while becoming active caretakers of their environment.


Please help make a difference in the lives of children who need it most while protecting some of the most special land on earth. You have an opportunity to open the way for young people to see that raising llamas is a viable and proud future. 
Break the cycle of poverty and please support this project today!
Thank you!

<h2><b>If this campaign has sparked <i>your</i> curiosity.</b></h2>
<p><i>If it has caused you to become passionate about it as I am</i>, these are the details:<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need. <br/>
</h3>The internet connection is needed which would support not only the 
36-inch telescope but other, smaller telescope systems that will also 
generate images (data) and sometimes those systems are better suited to a
 particular astronomy field of study for your students.  There is a need for a small building, to house one of the telescope systems with its very wide-angle

device with this campaign.<br/><br/><h3></h3>
<h3>What We Offer For Your Support (The Perks).</h3> <b>1. </b><b>Indiegogo will not allow me to put a Zero-Dollar Perk </b>to help any parent
 choose the right telescope for their child.  Contact me and I will use my
 30+ years in astronomy helping you find the right telescope.<br/><b>2. Our unique Perks</b> <b>are beautiful photographs</b> of our
 galaxy The Milky Way, or, of the Moon and Planets!  That is what we do 
and we hope you will want to claim one or all, frame them, and hang them
 on your wall!!!<b>  </b><i>You are not just buying a photo for $50, but rather getting a beautiful

<b>3. </b>There are Perks for students, kids of all ages really, to <b>Be The Astronomer!  </b>You
 will learn the basics of astro-imaging and experience The Universe in 
the process all from the comfort of your own home.  Telescope Operators
 work throughout the night at the observatory, so as long as it is night
 in Arizona we can accommodate your child, student or classroom.<br/>
<b>4. For any ASTRONOMY CLUB who wishes to help this campaign, </b>there is a Perk specifically for you.  <b>We can help you </b>offer your younger members a greatly reduced price to operate the 36-inch telescope!!<b>  <b>A 'High-Tech Outreach Program'.</b> Do you think this would encourage more young people to attend more of your meetings?<br/>5.

 that you would like to contribute, on 
their behalf, towards a Perk for them for an evening using the 36-inch 
telescope?  This is entirely possible, and your particular student or 
school has a unique opportunity to study the Universe.  This Perk also includes a 1-hour video chat with the class.  Topics for a 
student or school using the 36-inch could be; Determine the motion of 
an asteroid from several images of its movement among the stars, Reach 
out and capture an image of a 
Kuiper Belt Object (Pluto is a Kuiper Belt Object!!), or, image a series
 of galaxies searching for a new 
Supernova that has exploded!  These are but a few topics.  Contact me if
 there is something specific you had in mind.<br/>We do require the remote imaging perks to be claimed within two months after the campaign ends.  Booking must be mutually agreed upon and weather could be a factor in start or end times.<br/><h3></h3>
<h3>What I Hope. <br/>
</h3>
<b>Obviously we hope to reach the goal amount</b> so students (Young 
Astronomers) can do more advanced studies in Astrophysics with the 
Spectrograph....  The Custom Spectrograph system, when bolted to the 
36-inch diameter telescope will, undoubtedly, allow
 for some advanced studies of stars and that can <b>be the core of future 
astronomy programs for public, private or homeschooled students.</b>  <br/>For
 instance, Supernovae (plural for Supernova), have several methods that 
cause that stars annihilation; Thermal Runaway as part of a binary star 
system because of mass transfer from one to the other, or Core Collapse 
because a star started with too much mass and as the elements of the 
periodic table formed and the pressure pushed against gravity, 
gravity ultimately won.  By studying the Hydrogen, Silicon and Helium 
absorption lines determinations can be made regarding which type of 
Supernova it is.  These topics then become conversations the students 
would be part of.  <b>Imagine the look on a neighbors' face </b>when the
 'next-door neighbor kid' is overheard talking about the relative 
strength of the Carbon emission lines of the Wolf-Rayet spectral class 
WC7 star in Cygnus.  <b>Would you not want to help that kid...?</b> <br/><br/><h3>Things to remember should we get this campaign to be a success and what your contribution can mean.</h3>

<p>We are Seba Academy! Located in
Lithonia, Georgia, we’re a private learning center whose mission is to empower
students to be leaders of tomorrow, equip them with knowledge regarding their
cultural background, and develop them into life-long learners. Founder Willette
Akua, formerly a public school teacher, math specialist and instructional coach
felt the need for Seba to exist after “No Child Left Behind” initiatives
shifted public school focus from <i>child-centered
education</i> toward <i>test driven
instruction</i>. Husband and co-founder Chike Akua shares Willette’s passion
for teaching as he provides national training for teachers to increase student
achievement.</p>
<p><b>What are we looking to do?</b></p>
<p>In our three year existence, our
goal of educating children beyond standardized testing has been extremely
successful; 66% of our students perform above grade level, with some performing
even two or three levels above their grade. As educators, we would like to see
this trend continue with our students, not just for the grades we currently
teach (1-5), but in every grade thereafter until Seba’s students reach college.
That is why we’re looking for the resources necessary to expand Seba Academy to
middle school (grades 6-8). Our plans for expansion include hiring additional
teaching staff, expanding school grounds, introducing more STEM initiatives, and
purchasing student robotics kits and foreign language software. </p>
<p><b>Why are we worth helping?</b></p>
<p>From our inception, Seba Academy
has been and always will be about student success. Every element of our
expansion plan enhances the learning environment for our students in one way or
another. For those who share our enthusiasm for empowering and truly educating
the youth, we believe our project is a great opportunity to do so, and we hope
you agree! In taking part in our project, you’re investing in the future,
you’re telling our young people that you have full confidence in their
potential, and most importantly, you’re making a direct impact on young lives.</p>
<p><b>What’s in it for you?</b></p>
<p>Unlike some other crowdfunding
sites, IndieGoGo allows us to offer perks in exchange for your support, and
so we hope you enjoy the mix we’ve put together! If you would like to simply
donate without selecting a reward, we invite you to do so as well.  Whatever option you choose, we thank you all

<p>CriteriCon Prequel's Rio Hotel Masquerade Suite - Room number will be announced closer to the event when the hotel assigns it to us.<br/></p>

<h3>""What's ALSO happening at the Rio this year?"", they asked knowingly.<br/>
</h3>We scheduled <b>CriteriCon: Prequel</b> to coincide with another big 
convention happening at the same time and hotel - Star Trek Vegas 
(STLV). As long as we don't advertise within STLV, and respect the Rio's
 rules, we are clear to run our activities in our private room. We have 
already gotten the approval of the hotel, and reached out to STLV to 
offer collaboration opportunities, support, and to let them know we 
respect their rules. As we are also long-time attendees and supporters 
of STLV, we designed our activities to compliment their schedule - not 
compete. Our goal is to make this period of events as fun as possible 
for all attendees and special guests there. <br/><br/><h3>Funding Extras<br/>
</h3>
<p>There are additional charges likely to incur such as WiFi, extra 
tables and chairs, audio and video equipment, and other hotel services 
and materials we need for our activities. Fully funding this campaign helps us accommodate our attendees, featured guests, 
scheduled activities, create an inspiring atmosphere, and gives us room to grow.</p>
<p>We can afford 
more space and media hookups to host more activities throughout each day
 at the Rio Hotel if we get additional funds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional funds help us grow and continue our ""traveling mini 
convention"" model (inspired by our Prequel), as well as gets us striking
 out to find our set location for the full convention. We want to take 
CriteriCon's mini model to every convention that's interested in having 
us, and we also want to give a home to our annual full-size event.
</p>
<p>Help us get a running start via our 
Prequel!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>CriteriCon's Features - Growing us into 2017<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>We will feature games of all genres and kinds </b>including 
Alternate Realty Gaming, Live Action Role Playing, Tabletop RPGs, board 
games, card games, and video games. New games will be play-tested, game 
designers will run special events, and everyone will have the chance to 
get involved with at least one of our CriteriCon Special ARG or LARP 
events where we will merge attendees with people from all over the 
world! We also want to host a murder mystery dinner!</p>
<p><b>We will have interactive panels and demos</b>
 where the audience gets to participate and come away with resources or 
crafts. We will feature all aspects of production, from indie to big 
biz, covering development to distribution. Actors, voice actors, stunts 
people, costumers, FX makeup artists, props &amp; sets designers, VFX 
and digital artists, sound designers, musicians, writers, modeling &amp;
 photography instructors, programmers, graphic designers, puppeteers and
 creature creators, business start-up &amp; union advisors, and more 
will be there!</p>
<p><b>We will have exciting and unique entertainment </b>including
 interactive shows and other performances such as dance, comedy, music, 
magic, and tech. We will also have costume and craft shows where you get
 to display creations and even win awards. We will hold special events 
featuring celebrity performances and mixers, exciting bands, high tea 
afternoons, and themed dinners.</p>
<p><b>Our Exhibitor Hall </b>will 
feature creators and performers in every way possible. We have an 
optional interactive game event planned that will encourage attendees to
 check out as many presenters as they can at their booths or events, 
rewarding everyone in the process. Check out our Hopper Card concept 
below!</p>
<p><b>Our Badge and Hopper Card</b> - We are combining our badge with a 
reward system that ties in with our Exhibitor Hall interactive game 
event. You get a special sticker and reward for visiting a certain 
number of specific events or booths, and your Hopper Card will reflect 
this collection of signatures per visit. This helps our presenters get 
more focus and intimate opportunities to share their creations with our 
attendees, making it fun for everyone to participate.</p>

</h3>
<p>We're determined to hold our mini-schedule of activities this year in
 our private room (as our interactive business card and prequel), and we
 are driven to make this a full convention as well in 2017. But without 
funding assistance, it will take far longer to get our convention 
running, get a great venue booked, get solid resources, special guests, 
and to grow or even branch out. Contributing to CriteriCon gets you 
involved immediately, even if you can't attend right away, and by doing 
so, you also contribute to helping us support other independent 
businesses and artists all over. We plan to run a traveling smaller 
version of our convention as often as possible, even if we can't run a 
big one, and we plan to take it to different conventions all over the 
world. We need your help here, not only to do this, but to establish a 
base of operation, a full convention, and to be able to branch out in 
the future. If you want CriteriCon closer to you, or to keep running, 
then we need your help. So far, we've put our personal funds into this 
and we can only go for so long without support. We will hold to our 
promises if we are able to complete this campaign successfully, and we 
will still continue to support the causes we believe in and help others 
in their endeavors. </p>
<p>Possible space overflow: We may experience a surge of interest in our
 schedule of events over the course of the 5 days we are running our 
Prequel at the Rio Hotel. In the case where we run out of room for 
people to fit safely in our suite per event/activity, we will host more 
than one of these during the day in order to accommodate those who wish 
to participate. As we are competing for hotel space at this venue, 
during this particular time of the year, we would need to raise a 
significant amount in order to secure additional rooms or space in the 
area. Whether or not that happens, we will be doing our best to utilize 
our large suite, and will be talking with others who have offered to 
donate their room space for overflow or additional activities.</p>
<p>We ask for your help in making this as awesome as possible. We have a
 lot of fun and unique activities planned for everyone and we'd love to 
make them come alive!</p>

Thank you to those who are joining us once more to get our traveling mini convention model off the ground and helping us make CriteriCon it's own full convention as well! Reward perks are available as before (plus new perks!) and our activities' schedule will be updated as we get new additions!


CriteriCon: Prequel is a creativity-promoting, social event happening this August 3-7, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada at the Rio Hotel.
Our goal is to help CriteriCon become a traveling mini convention as well as a full-size, independent convention. CriteriCon: Prequel is our interactive business card!
CriteriCon supports and spotlights innovative 
creators, interactive entertainment, independent production, and great causes. CriteriCon is driven to be exciting, safe, all inclusive, and
 progressive. We want you to have fun, make friends, and come away with 
great memories and tools that can help you with your creative interests,
 goals, and dreams.
CriteriCon: Prequel 2016 Entry
 - Our Prequel is free to attend, however, we have a limited amount of space available in our suite per activity this year, which is why we offer a reward tier with priority entrance into our events. Our Prequel will operate as a highly active hosting and 
hospitality room for attendees and hotel visitors who are there already 
for Star Trek Vegas Con. We operate on our creator's personal funds, your donations at the event, and 
fundraiser contributions made here.
About CriteriCon's Name - ""CriteriCon"" is inspired by the meaning of the word ""criterion"". We want people to 
get to know and be inspired by the amazing, important people and 
detailed processes behind works of art, performance, and production.
Check out our featured artist! Keezy Young created our 2016 Backer Design!



The Prequel

We will be hosting a mini schedule of activities in our private suite at the Rio Hotel over the course of five days. Contributions go towards covering the space (which we already reserved) so we

CriteriCon Prequel's Rio Hotel Masquerade Suite - Room number will be announced closer to the event when the hotel assigns it to us.

""What's ALSO happening at the Rio this year?"", they asked knowingly.
We scheduled CriteriCon: Prequel to coincide with another big 
convention happening at the same time and hotel - Star Trek Vegas 
(STLV). As long as we don't advertise within STLV, and respect the Rio's
 rules, we are clear to run our activities in our private room. We have 
already gotten the approval of the hotel, and reached out to STLV to

of STLV, we designed our activities to compliment their schedule - not 
compete. Our goal is to make this period of events as fun as possible 
for all attendees and special guests there. Funding Extras

There are additional charges likely to incur such as WiFi, extra 
tables and chairs, audio and video equipment, and other hotel services 
and materials we need for our activities. Fully funding this campaign helps us accommodate our attendees, featured guests, 
scheduled activities, create an inspiring atmosphere, and gives us room to grow.
We can afford 
more space and media hookups to host more activities throughout each day
 at the Rio Hotel if we get additional funds.

Additional funds help us grow and continue our ""traveling mini 
convention"" model (inspired by our Prequel), as well as gets us striking
 out to find our set location for the full convention. We want to take 
CriteriCon's mini model to every convention that's interested in having 
us, and we also want to give a home to our annual full-size event.

Help us get a running start via our 
Prequel!

<p><strong>Here’s the EXCITING Scoop</strong></p>
<p>Here's two new projects longing to get out to YOU and YOUR FAMILY to help YOU be the best that you can be —</p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully intimate.</li>
<li>Cognitively bright.</li>
<li>And with a healthy gut to achieve unstoppable wellness!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. First is my new book and online course — SEXY BRAIN: <i>How Sizzling Intimacy and Balanced Hormones Prevent Alzheimer’s, Cancer, Depression And Divorce</i> </strong></p>
<p>Nature is all about the next generation, even with intimacy!</p>
<p>Nature put <i>pleasure</i> into hugging, cuddling, and orgasms for a reason. To protect your brain. Healthier parents make for happier, more stable families. Sex is supposed to be brain-gasmic. This means filled with ecstasy and brain-boosting power. But you have to know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Just like you can't sit down in front of a piano and magically become an amazing musician, fabulous brain-boosting intimacy needs to be learned. This book introduces a science-based intimacy skill set called the  ""hormone language of love.""</p>
<p>I am a hormone scholar. I have worked with the top scientists studying and publishing data on everything surrounding hormones. I show how estrogen and testosterone are hard-wired in their deepest biology. I translate the amazing differences between these hormones into what happens in your conversations, therapist’s office, but most importantly, in your bedroom. Understanding the “hormone language of love” will help you achieve amazing brain-boosting sex and the tools to make love stay.</p>
<p>The book will launch along with a 6-week intimacy online course. A sizzling power point will show with great illustrations the mesmerizing understanding of how and why it’s so challenging for men and women to understand each other. And love each other. And have the kind of orgasms that can bathe our brains in intelligence.</p>
<p>I share information never before presented. The scientist Dr. Michael Baker kindly shared with me his not yet published data on how estrogen and testosterone signaling first evolved. This shows you why the Mars/Venus dance can be so exasperating, but gives you the know-how to make it easy and delicious.</p>
<p>Parents can hand this book to their young adults who are about to get married, with peace of mind that it will give them a better chance at happiness, and decrease their risk of divorce.</p>
<p>The online course will be for practitioners, coaches and regular folk, but no one under 18 years old.</p>
<p><strong>2. My other new project is called DIGESTIVE FREEDOM: Eat Your Way To Intestinal Wellness</strong>, an online certification course for professionals (and smart patients). This provides natural answers for diverse gut disorders, and many protocols not yet know by most experts.</p>
<p>This is a sequel to my book <strong>Healthy Digestion The Natural Way</strong>, which was the first gut/nutrition/mind book on the market, and successfully sold for over 20 years. <i>Digestive Freedom</i> now takes gut health further. It introduces the much needed new genre of <i>Nutritional Gastroenterology</i>.</p>
<p><i>Digestive Freedom</i>  also introduces the <i>unappreciated role of</i> <i>hormones</i> <i>and the gut</i>. I share my personal strategic, safe, and science-based hormone protocols for inflammatory bowel disease and other gut disorders. This information how some colons can be spared from surgeries.</p>
<p>Digestive Freedom (the course and ultimately the 600 page reference book) is filled with <i>firsts</i>. For example, I share a new scientific understanding of <strong>how estrogen is produced in the stomach</strong>! And how this helps the liver and gallbladder detox. If the liver is fatty or ill, if the gallbladder has stones or has been removed, this estrogen is then shunted mainstream. I help you know what do to about it.</p>
<p>I tell you how normal pregnancies can damage healthy digestive cells and how to identify and fix this. I show how parathyroid issues can be linked to grabbing for an acid blocker. I share foods that fight pathogens better than some meds, proven in randomized trials. I show how glaucoma may be linked to an intestinal infection. And more!</p>
<p><i><strong>Digestive Freedom </strong></i>starts out as a 6-month certification course for practitioners (MDs, NDs, DCs, health coaches, and more) and ultimately made into a 600-page reference book so many can benefit from this information for years to come. This book is almost ready for the editor. But it is so large and in-depth that the formatting and indexing will take about ¼ of a year to finish and cost about $9000 just for these actions.</p>
<p><strong>My kids —</strong></p>
<p>I could not have children due to a drug my mother was given when pregnant with me.</p>
<p>Thus, my books and projects are my children and legacies.</p>
<p>Help me birth them!</p>
<p><strong>COSTS — </strong></p>
<p>I've already written 18 books—some best-sellers, some out of print, and some still selling. I now want to own all stages of my projects to avoid the growing complexity of the publishing industry.</p>
<p>The costs for editing, formatting, indexing, and cover art for both these projects and courses are huge. SEXY BRAIN will cost about $15,000 to get out there and DIGESTIVE FREEDOM in it’s scope, the first of it’s kind ever so purpose driven and written, will be about double that.</p>
<p><strong>BACKSTORY</strong></p>
<p><strong>I already had to put almost $20,000 into just getting the rights to write and create the online digestive course!</strong></p>
<p>Wiley &amp; Sons published <i>Healthy Digestion</i> in 2000. It sold solidly and is used by the prestigious American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine as the authority in natural protocols to heal gut health. This group is the largest training institution for functional MDs in over 120 countries.</p>
<p>Wiley then sold all their trade books, including mine, to another company that basically buried it. Two years ago I had to buy my book back for almost $20,000 in order to update and republish it!</p>
<p>I had already honed and used the concepts in this book to reboot my own health as well as the health of thousands of my clients over my 40+ years in practice.  For years I was seriously ill and was told by many doctors that I would never be well. I spent a year in bed . . . until I discovered the amazing healing abilities of strategic hormone balancing, nutrition, and rebooting the gut.</p>
<p>Healing pearl after healing pearl will be in the course and the books!</p>
<ul>
<li>You will learn exact detoxes to reboot receptor function that our toxic environment is damaging.</li>
<li>You will learn why and how testosterone can only “take” compared to estrogen and how this translates into sex.</li>
<li>You will learn how to treat even recurrent diverticulitis without antibiotics and the scientific articles that even your gastroenterologist doesn’t know.</li>
<li>You will learn that more fiber protects the gut from diverticuli is a myth.</li>
<li>You will learn what daily task can paralyze your lipoprotein lipase enzymes that line all your digestive organs, and what to do about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this amazing natural set of NEW and SAFE and EXCITING factoids will be available to the practitioners that heal you, and ultimately for your own home reference library.</p>
<p>I am asking for only $22,000, although the actual costs are higher.</p>
<p><strong>Why I need these funds —</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The scope of both books and courses and the brand new information is enormous and has taken much time and money.</li>
<li>I took off much of the last few years to write these courses and books.</li>

Help me birth them!

You will learn how to treat even recurrent diverticulitis without antibiotics and the scientific articles that even your gastroenterologist doesn’t know.
You will learn that more fiber protects the gut from diverticuli is a myth.

All this amazing natural set of NEW and SAFE and EXCITING factoids will be available to the practitioners that heal you, and ultimately for your own home reference library.
I am asking for only $22,000, although the actual costs are higher.
Why I need these funds —

The scope of both books and courses and the brand new information is enormous and has taken much time and money.
I took off much of the last few years to write these courses and books.
I bought the rights to Healthy Digestion.
I have already paid over $6000 in editing alone for SEXY BRAIN and now it is ready for formatting, indexing and marketing.
So I need your help to get them OUT to the public.

Those who know my work, know I write game-changing books.
Examples are —


Hormone Deception: One of the first books on endocrine-disrupting compounds in the environment.

Natural Answers For Women's Health: The only female reference book on 225 conditions and how they relate to hormones, food, and nutrition.

Safe Hormones, Smart Women: One of the breakthrough books on the safety and need for bioidentical hormone replacement.

</div><p>Many of these maps have never been released, and those that have, have
been designed with different publications in mind and are all tailored to be
viewed slightly differently. As a result of this, there needs to be a
unification process before the maps are all uploaded into the Interactive Map
Portal, Maporia; all Fonts need to be of the same type, all rivers the
same color, all land needs to be colored the same etc.</p><p>
Furthermore, narrative needs to be added to a number of maps, and each map
needs to be uploaded in a specific way to allow the maps to be easily
searchable, with different search terms in mind, for example</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Time Period</li>
<li>Map Type (Battle, Economic,

<p>Historia’s Maps should not be confused with map archives
which have been constituted by scanning very old maps produced in the 18<sup>th</sup>,
19th and 20th century. As commendable and of importance as they are because of their
production over the past 200 years ago or so; the very limited methods and
technology available in those times means that they are all low quality in
design, content, and additionally, have degenerated over time. They do no load
well on a computer screen and are difficult to interpret. Historia’s maps are
produced in very high quality, vivid colours, and are all digitised using the
latest state of the art technology.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465824253/Funding_bmnd3x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Historia requires $5M to fund the digital map unification process,
including office rental, staff, as well as all associated office  IT and computer
costs. This major unification process will take approximately 25 Digital
Graphic specialists and Cartographers, a handful of editors with a substantial
knowledge of history as well as the associated admin and support staff. This is
expected to take approximately a year due to the sheer size of the 14,000 + map
archive. Therefore the funding will be used for</p>
<ul>
<li>the building of the highly sophisticated and secure Interactive Portal that will enable
     the maps to be searched efficiently, smoothly and in a user friendly
     manner;</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">establishing a sales and
     marketing team with multi linguistic abilities to promote the subscription
     packages on offer on a global basis;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>and enable the company to
     grow and develop its multiple income sources after launch, without income
     until at least 6 months after formal completion of the unification
     process. It is realistically expected that the first income will be
     received in months 2 - 3 following the launch;</li>
</ul>
<p>Should Historia not receive the full requirement of $5M, there are
multiple different alternative sources for funding that can be reached out to. These
include both equity and borrowing. For obvious reasons these are not the
preferred method of funding.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Maporia.com will be a highly interactive,
easy to use and smooth interface that will allow the user to access over 14,000
themed maps and “journey through time around the world”.</p>
<p>The user will be presented with an
interactive map view of the globe or a flat map. The interactive map will
enable the user to move their mouse over various regions of the world, or to rotate
the globe. The user will be able to zoom in and out of the interactive map;
this will form a large part of the screen.</p>
<p>As the user moves their mouse over the
various regions, a vertical ‘stack’ of maps will appear on the page next to a
vertical timeline, offering the user a chance to select a map from a specific
time in history. If the user was to move over France, for example, they would be
presented with maps referring to French historical topics, for example Napoleonic
campaigns, WWI and WWII, amongst many others. As the user selects from the
vertical stack of maps the selected map would move forward and become the main
screen item.</p>
<p>If a user so chooses, they would be able
to navigate further into a particular map area; so if they wished to focus on
the Pacific Ocean in the 1940's they would be offered maps of the Pearl Harbor Attack, the whole Pacific Theater Campaign, as well as many others.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465841804/Pearl_Harbor_Attacks_ntsl9i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<br/>
<p>Users will also have the ability to see a
‘heat map’ of the interactive map, whereby the user will be able to select a
time in history and the interactive map ‘glows’ to indicate map coverage. If,
for example, a user wanted to know what maps were available for the 1940s, then
Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Pacific Ocean would glow vividly to
indicate that maps were available.</p>
<p>Maps on the Maporia Portal will be ""Geo Aware"" i.e. a map of an event in Northern France will be placed in the Portal in such a way that the Portal will ""know"" that the map is in Northern France,  This Geo Awareness will mean that if a user was operating the Maporia Portal on their Handheld device with Location Services Activated, then as a user moved physically around a landscape, e.g. on the D Day Beaches, then the Maporia Portal would indicate the Users exact location with respect to that Map within the Portal; giving a truly interactive experience for the User.</p>
<p>Each map will be accompanied by explanatory
text and users will also be given the opportunity to purchase books based on
the map topic selected. This would be routed through an affiliate basis with
another web site: for example, a user viewing a map of the Normandy Invasion would
be presented with an option specifically relating to purchasing books about the Normandy <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Invasion/WW II etc. The user would be
directed to a website such as Amazon, and Historia would receive commission on
every book sale that took place from that referral.</span></p>

Historia’s maps reflect the dynamic sweep of world history, from
prehistoric migrations to 21st-century conflicts. These high quality maps cover
a vast array of topics and themes, some of them played out on the world stage,
others at a more localized scale: from transcontinental trade routes, conquests
and empires to the evolution of historic cities and the development of
individual nation states.






(This Map shows the Migration Of Homo Sapiens, please visit our website www.HistoriaMediaGroup.com  to see this map (as well as many other high quality informative maps) in greater detail ... we have ""zoomed"" in on Africa and copy it below)  



All
of these unique high quality maps are supported by concise explanatory
narrative with suggested links to other maps in the archive. This
well-designed, easy-to-navigate online super ""one stop"" resource
will provide not only an unrivaled unique high quality map archive but
one which is not available anywhere else in the world. This in-depth super
archive resource will provide new horizons and 21st century learning and
delivery opportunities, for global education establishments, lecturers,
academics, teachers, researchers, students, global businesses, news /media
organizations, and other interested individuals and organizations.

With the online education market expected to top $4 trillion
a year within 5 years, Historia / Maporia will be well placed to expand into
this marketplace, and deliver highly accurate, detailed and informative maps that
help expand a user’s knowledge base in ways never before seen and change the
way History, Political Sciences, Geography and many other subjects are taught
worldwide.
Quality education and knowledge is a great factor in
correctly directing our future generations across the globe. By providing
quality and factual material and information, education enhances the way as
citizens of the world, we interact with each other and our planet in a respectful
humane way.









Malcolm Swanston, FRGS (www.MalcolmSwanston.com), one of the
founders of Historia, is a cartographic innovator, with a gifted ability
to translate world historical events, accurately, into highly informative, high
quality, maps. He has spent over forty years creating historical themed maps
and publications of excellence, many of which have been used as reference
material. All of these maps are now in digital format.
Malcolm created the maps for the ground-breaking Times Atlas of
World History, which has been published in 18 languages and sold millions of
copies in many countries. He went on to create many more titles for Times Books
and thematic atlases for the international co-editions market. Malcolm’s recent
atlases have been published by Oxford University Press, Hachette, Henry Holt
Inc., and many more. The latest – Restless Empire – was published by
Harvard University Press in 2015. In recognition of his lifelong work of
academic excellence Malcolm attained a Fellowship of the Royal Geographical
Society, London in 2014.
A Google Search of Malcolm Swanston Maps, or Malcolm Swanston Books returns an incredible list of map works and books that Malcolm has been involved with either through direct production or consultation on, and a whole host of positive book reviews; a true example of academic and map excellence.
Over the next few months Malcolm, and his team supported by a handpicked
selection of world-renowned academics will be reviewing, organizing, categorizing
the digital archive, and integrating the maps into the portal, in preparation
for the launch of Maporia.com.

This 14,000 + strong digital Map Archive has never been released before.
This high quality vast collection of digital maps is not only unique and unrivaled,
but there is no similar collection anywhere in the world.
This vast unique unrivaled high quality 14,000 + map collection
will provide
new horizons and 21st century learning and delivery opportunities for global
education establishments, lecturers, academics, teachers, researchers,
students, global businesses, news /media organizations, other interested
individuals and organizations and nothing remotely similar exists in the world and therefore Historia regularly receives
contact from Academia enquiring when this archive will be released.





Many of these maps have never been released, and those that have, have
been designed with different publications in mind and are all tailored to be
viewed slightly differently. As a result of this, there needs to be a
unification process before the maps are all uploaded into the Interactive Map
Portal, Maporia; all Fonts need to be of the same type, all rivers the
same color, all land needs to be colored the same etc.
Furthermore, narrative needs to be added to a number of maps, and each map
needs to be uploaded in a specific way to allow the maps to be easily
searchable, with different search terms in mind, for example

Location
Time Period
Map Type (Battle, Economic,
     Migration, Religious etc.)
Map Matter (Tanks, Aircraft,
     Buildings, Humans etc.)









Historia’s Maps should not be confused with map archives
which have been constituted by scanning very old maps produced in the 18th,
19th and 20th century. As commendable and of importance as they are because of their
production over the past 200 years ago or so; the very limited methods and
technology available in those times means that they are all low quality in
design, content, and additionally, have degenerated over time. They do no load
well on a computer screen and are difficult to interpret. Historia’s maps are
produced in very high quality, vivid colours, and are all digitised using the
latest state of the art technology.



Historia requires $5M to fund the digital map unification process,
including office rental, staff, as well as all associated office  IT and computer
costs. This major unification process will take approximately 25 Digital
Graphic specialists and Cartographers, a handful of editors with a substantial
knowledge of history as well as the associated admin and support staff. This is
expected to take approximately a year due to the sheer size of the 14,000 + map
archive. Therefore the funding will be used for

the building of the highly sophisticated and secure Interactive Portal that will enable
     the maps to be searched efficiently, smoothly and in a user friendly
     manner;

establishing a sales and
     marketing team with multi linguistic abilities to promote the subscription
     packages on offer on a global basis;

and enable the company to
     grow and develop its multiple income sources after launch, without income
     until at least 6 months after formal completion of the unification
     process. It is realistically expected that the first income will be
     received in months 2 - 3 following the launch;

Should Historia not receive the full requirement of $5M, there are
multiple different alternative sources for funding that can be reached out to. These
include both equity and borrowing. For obvious reasons these are not the
preferred method of funding.







Maporia.com will be a highly interactive,
easy to use and smooth interface that will allow the user to access over 14,000
themed maps and “journey through time around the world”.
The user will be presented with an
interactive map view of the globe or a flat map. The interactive map will
enable the user to move their mouse over various regions of the world, or to rotate
the globe. The user will be able to zoom in and out of the interactive map;
this will form a large part of the screen.
As the user moves their mouse over the
various regions, a vertical ‘stack’ of maps will appear on the page next to a
vertical timeline, offering the user a chance to select a map from a specific
time in history. If the user was to move over France, for example, they would be
presented with maps referring to French historical topics, for example Napoleonic
campaigns, WWI and WWII, amongst many others. As the user selects from the
vertical stack of maps the selected map would move forward and become the main
screen item.
If a user so chooses, they would be able
to navigate further into a particular map area; so if they wished to focus on
the Pacific Ocean in the 1940's they would be offered maps of the Pearl Harbor Attack, the whole Pacific Theater Campaign, as well as many others.



(Again, we have ""zoomed"" in and copy a section below)





Users will also have the ability to see a
‘heat map’ of the interactive map, whereby the user will be able to select a
time in history and the interactive map ‘glows’ to indicate map coverage. If,
for example, a user wanted to know what maps were available for the 1940s, then
Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Pacific Ocean would glow vividly to
indicate that maps were available.
Maps on the Maporia Portal will be ""Geo Aware"" i.e. a map of an event in Northern France will be placed in the Portal in such a way that the Portal will ""know"" that the map is in Northern France,  This Geo Awareness will mean that if a user was operating the Maporia Portal on their Handheld device with Location Services Activated, then as a user moved physically around a landscape, e.g. on the D Day Beaches, then the Maporia Portal would indicate the Users exact location with respect to that Map within the Portal; giving a truly interactive experience for the User.
Each map will be accompanied by explanatory
text and users will also be given the opportunity to purchase books based on
the map topic selected. This would be routed through an affiliate basis with
another web site: for example, a user viewing a map of the Normandy Invasion would
be presented with an option specifically relating to purchasing books about the Normandy Invasion/WW II etc. The user would be
directed to a website such as Amazon, and Historia would receive commission on
every book sale that took place from that referral.





With each map there will be



Explanatory Text


Related Maps


Related Books


A Chat Forum to discuss the map and associated
events



Within this Forum there will be communities of users discussing
particular events in History across the world from each other, the world’s
first dedicated online interchange of Map Information and History. There will be
users returning to particular maps time and time again to exchange information
and learn in unison.
The “Facebook” of the Academic World.






Historia will be receiving income from the following sources

Private Subscribers
Institutional Subscribers
     (Schools, Colleges, Universities, Government Departments, Research Organisations,
     News & Media Companies etc)
Advertising Income
Sponsorship Income
Affiliate Book Sales

Due to the very nature of the Portal having worldwide appeal and
customers, it is expected that the business will have major interest from
different companies around the world wishing to advertise on, and sponsor key
historical events.






Once all of the maps have been unified and integrated into the Maporia Portal, the Cartographic Team will be working on the creation of new maps to continually enhance and develop the archive.
The archive will also be translated into other leading world languages to further elevate the offering and open up the resource to even more users worldwide.

There are also plans to add to the Portal in a way that would be ground breaking worldwide and open the attractiveness of Maporia to truly incredible levels both in content and user appetite; this however will be taking place approximately 12 months after full launch.





To raise funds to enable to unification process and all of the other
matters set out above to take place, Historia are offering a number of
different perks and opportunities including heavily discounted Advance
Subscription Packages. Take up of these will raise the funds required and give
those that take part in the perk purchases the unique opportunity to support the
worthwhile endeavors of Historia in improving worldwide knowledge and
education for future generations.

In 2009, StartOut was founded to provide these missing resources and connect LGBTQ entrepreneurs. Since then, we have become the leading national non-profit for LGBTQ entrepreneurs and our friends and allies. We are organizing over 70 in-person events this year alone, but in only six cities in the U.S. Thus, we are very excited to launch the StartOut Community online and to connect LGBTQ entrepreneurs — no matter where you live. To provide the tools for more member-to-member engagement and accelerate your success, we are building a brand new platform.
StartOut's goal is to create jobs and prosperity for LGBTQ individuals and the local communities where they contribute, and be recognized and respected for those efforts. That's where you come in: we need your support to get there.


The goals of this campaign are twofold: to raise funds to launch our online community and programs; and to encourage broad engagement among LGBTQ entrepreneurs.  More specifically, your contributions will help us to:

Connect LGBTQ entrepreneurs beyond our six chapter cities, 24/7 and wherever you live, on your phone or laptop.
Showcase our members' successes and challenges, and the positive impact LGBTQ entrepreneurs have on society.
Cultivate a vibrant community of mentors and mentees to foster future success.
Connect entrepreneurs and potential investors on a secure platform.




Every project faces challenges, and as
entrepreneurs, we love a challenge! Ours is to reach a large number of
entrepreneurs and their supporters in cities and remote areas alike to build
critical mass nationwide.

We are aiming to raise $30K to meet our goals. We trust you will find a
contribution level that fits your pocketbook and your heart. The more we raise, the more programs we can fund,
the more services we can provide to all of you, and the stronger our Community
becomes.  Funds in excess of $30K will go toward accelerated expansion and
more programming. 








Numbers matter and together, we can be a powerful group that deserves respect. Together we can change the way society views and experiences our contributions to local communities everywhere. You will find funding, a business partner, great business advice, and an awesome Community of like-minded individuals ready to support you.
 


We will publicize, with permission, our members’ entrepreneurial success stories and help change the conversation in communities everywhere. We just launched the first-of-its-kind study on the State of LGBT Entrepreneurship in the U.S.  Over time and thanks to your participation, we will measure and chronicle our Community's progress. There has never been a more important time to do this, given the charged political and social climate that exists today.

With a successful history of building and responsibly managing StartOut for seven years, we have assembled experienced partners, including the founders of gay.com/gay.net and Here Media, to support building a platform that elevates the outstanding voices of the LGBTQ community in the U.S. They are all intimately involved in launching this platform and are offering their time and experience to this project free of charge. 


Our community needs you now. We invite you to participate in our campaign and build a global network of LGBTQ people who are going to change the world.

We would like to thank our corporate partners for their generous and ongoing support of StartOut, the organization.  Your participation in this campaign will help us to augment our partners' commitments and build the StartOut online Community.",14.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><br/><strong>This morning we visited Marcos, a 13 month old who has not been feeling well. He’s had a fever for 3 days and diarrhea for over a week. </strong></p>
<p>“Has he seen a doctor?” I asked his mom, Florinda.</p>
<p>“I’m going to see her today. I’m leaving this morning.”</p>
<p>I was relieved. I wasn’t comfortable with those types of symptoms and if it were my son, we would be visiting a doctor.</p>
<p>“Can we pray for you and Marcos?”</p>
<p>She nodded yes. She seemed so distracted.</p>
<p>As we were praying, I felt the Holy Spirit of God telling me to drive her to the doctor. </p>
<p>“What time is your appointment?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t have an appointment,” she answered.</p>
<p>“Can we drive you?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Thank you,” she said with a shy smile.</p>
<p>We parked the van and walked down an alley. We passed a parked truck with 5 young men, and an older woman standing around it. The scene seemed sketchy to me. We asked if they know where the Dr.’s office was. The older lady walked up to us and told us that she died yesterday! My mind was racing!  What? </p>
<p>“I’m just kidding! I’m the doctor!”</p>
<p>We should have just walked away. </p>
<p>We entered a metal door of what looked like a home, not a doctor’s office. There was a handmade sign outside the door, “Firewood for sale”. As we walked through the narrow hall, there were piles of 2nd hand clothes and another sign, “Clothes for sale”. At the end of the hallway, there were eight chicken crates with live chickens. She seemed to trust this “doctor”, so we kept going. She parted a curtain that led to…her bedroom! I’m not kidding! A bed, a dresser, small refrigerator, mirror, family photos! </p>
<p> We should have walked away. </p>
<p>“Lay your baby on the bed. Tell me, how is your baby feeling?”</p>
<p>After listening to the symptoms and poking around his tummy, she said she had something for Marcos and that she would be right back.  She came back with a small glass of watery oatmeal looking “stuff”. </p>
<p>At this point I really felt like I might be in shock because I couldn’t seem to speak fast enough. In my best Spanish I tried to understand what she was asking Florinda to give Marcos. He’s trying to swallow but can’t seem to drink it fast enough as this crazy lady is prodding Florinda to force it down. I can confidently say, this lady was NOT a doctor, and we needed to get out of there. </p>
<p>“How much do we owe you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“20 Quetzales.” Which is the equivalent of $2.50. We overpaid. </p>
<p>We left the bedroom, walked passed the chickens and clothes and firewood. We walked back down the creepy alley to my van.</p>
<p>“Florinda, can I take you to the doctor I take my kids to?”</p>
<p>She nodded yes. </p>
<p>We drove 40 minutes and met with a real doctor. When we explained what we had just gone through, he said it's very common and a big problem in Guatemala. Because the smaller villages don’t have a doctor, someone eventually starts mixing home remedies. Unfortunately, every village has a crazy lady “doctor” who knows nothing about medicine.</p>
<p>After examining Marcos and talking with his mom, the doctor explained that the baby has an infection and needs treated right away. BUT, the bigger problem is that Marcos is severely malnourished. He looks like a 5 month old and can’t sit up, let alone crawl or walk. The doctor can’t even prescribe antibiotics because he feels they need to be administered by an IV and watched closely by a physician.</p>
<p>This news is devastating to Florinda. She doesn’t want to go back to the hospital. She was just there with Marcos for a month, and now the doctor is saying Marcos may need 4 more months of hospitalization to get him healthy again.</p>
<p>All I can see is the fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>And here is the root of the problem. As we walked out of the doctor’s office, I paid 150 Quetzales, which is the equivalent of $20 U.S. You and I know that’s an inexpensive doctor visit, but that’s a mountain of money to people of the villages. </p>
<p>The drive home was quiet. I can’t imagine what she was thinking. I encouraged her and let her know that we would help in any way we could. We would pray for her and visit her. We parked the van and walked her to her home. “If the doctor says we have to take him in, we have to do it,” she said.</p>
<p>I always imagined that as a missionary, my days would end with feelings of satisfaction or at least contentment. But our drive home was a lot like it is on most days, driving quietly, with my heart breaking into a million pieces. </p>
<p>Please pray that Marcos gets to the hospital this week. Please pray for a full recovery to a healthy weight. Please pray that his parents would have patience and strength. And yes, please pray for the crazy lady “doctor”.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477700589/mmbcjdf0gvewucq4effp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>That was 3 years ago!</strong>  Florinda took Marcos to the National Hospital and after a few days returned home.  We visited Marcos and delivered PediaSure every week for 6 months.  We prayed and stood by their family as Marcos gained weight and began to grow!  I recently saw Florinda and Marcos walking in the village.  I took this picture and plan to hang it in the clinic as a reminder of God's faithfulness.  <br/><br/><strong>This is why we’re determined to build a clinic.  We want to give moms an alternative to back alley medicine.  Along with a private Guatemalan doctor, we'll have a team of nurses who will visit from the States every month to help moms like Florinda.  They’re committed to teaching about the importance of clean water and clean air stoves.  They’re committed to loving a village that, for the most part, has been forgotten.</strong><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>The Power of Prayer Journal</strong></h3>
<p>After 4 years in Guatemala, this is what I've learned. You cannot be impactful as a missionary without God.  It seems obvious but it's not.  AND, we need to draw closer to Him daily through prayer and Bible study.  THOSE are the building blocks of being a missionary.  And those are the building blocks of this journal.</p>

<p>Vonda and I wanted a more organized way to share our thoughts and prayers with God.  Even as missionaries, it can be hard to stay focused on the most important things.  And for us, spending time with God, LOVING God, is <strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT</strong> thing. <br/><br/>We dreamed about, designed and printed this journal right here in Guatemala, on the mission field. We LOVE IT, and we want YOU to have it!<br/><br/>When you donate $50 or $100 or even $1,000 toward this project, we want to give you The Power of Prayer Journal.  <strong>It’s our gift to you.</strong>  It's had SO MUCH IMPACT on our prayer life, we want EVERYONE to have one.<br/><br/><i>""I love my journal! It's a great way to be intentional about my time with God. I love sitting down before bed and recapping my day and acknowledging who God put in my path. Keeping a prayer list has also allowed me to recognize answered prayers and to give God the praise for how He is on the move!

<div><h3><strong>Black History is MORE than slavery, colonization, and the struggle for basic human rights.</strong></h3></div> <p>Starting from a young age, students deserve the opportunity to learn about their heritage. Unfortunately, many Black/African-American students are made to believe their history only spans over the past 300 hundred years; and that this history can be covered accurately and thoroughly all within the month of February.</p> <p>History plays a crucial role in how we identify ourselves. It is vital to understand where we come from and how we move forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Udeesa Systemics &amp; Technology we have created educational tools to support the sustaining of an understanding of history and heritage. We utilize primary resources &amp; storytelling to showcase the real Africa and encourage students to build curiosity and critical thinking skills. </p>

<p>Augmented Reality (AR) is the premier feature in the release of Volume 2 of our series.

<p> </p>
<p>The stories of 'Anansi the Spider' are originally Ghanaian folktales, now prevalent throughout the world, where Anansi the Spider is considered to be the keeper of all knowledge &amp; stories. Anansi and his countless adventures reflect lessons and proverbs that have sustained communities throughout African history. </p>

Unfortunately, many Black/African-American students are made to believe their history only spans over the past 300 hundred years; and that this history can be covered accurately and thoroughly all within the month of February. History plays a crucial role in how we identify ourselves. It is vital to understand where we come from and how we move forward.
 
At Udeesa Systemics & Technology we have created educational tools to support the sustaining of an understanding of history and heritage. We utilize primary resources & storytelling to showcase the real Africa and encourage students to build curiosity and critical thinking skills. 

Udeesa is on the verge of releasing the latest edition of our interactive storybook series along with an iOS/Android Mobile Application, and we need your support to make these resources available to students and educators.
By combining traditional African folktales with technologies like virtual tourism, augmented reality, and virtual reality, students can visualize concepts and study cultures in new and interactive ways.  
 

 
Augmented Reality (AR) is the premier feature in the release of Volume 2 of our series. AR is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including (but not limited to) visual, auditory, and haptic feedback.
 

 
Today, we are raising $20k to complete and distribute Volume 2 of our interactive African folklore series, accompanied by our first mobile application, Compass.
Compass will bring the stories of Anansi the Spider to life in the hands of our readers. Your contributions will allow us to further incorporate Augmented Reality, audio-visual playback & a directional compass into unique learning experiences with African History and folklore.
 

 
Udeesa’s Extended Reality (XR) Storybook Series combines these traditional West African Folktales with new and emerging immersive technologies.
 

 
The stories of 'Anansi the Spider' are originally Ghanaian folktales, now prevalent throughout the world, where Anansi the Spider is considered to be the keeper of all knowledge & stories. Anansi and his countless adventures reflect lessons and proverbs that have sustained communities throughout African history. 
Given persistent racial inequities in education and the nature of curricula still dense in Eurocentric perspectives, there is a lack of inclusion felt by many Black/African descendant students. Because of this discrepancy, there is an urgency to embrace new & equitable teaching techniques in the classroom that are compatible with both virtual & in-person learning.

<span>1. What is the current progress of this project?</span><br/>
<p>This project is still at its inception, despite that system complexes, sketches are already at hand. In addition, media servers are being built, we are still in search of more team members for client app development and UI designer - they will be recruited shortly.</p>
<span>2. When will Corlens hit its general availability phase?</span><br/>
<p>According to our plan, the software should be finished next year, 
probably November or so. While we set this goal for next year, there is 
no assurance, unforeseen setbacks may take place, especially when it 
comes to software development, but we will endeavour to get it done 
before the deadline.</p>
<span>3. What type of platforms or devices will this software support?</span><br/>
<p>Our targets are on PCs, Macs and Android mobile phones. We believe 
accessibility and compatibility is very important. We will, therefore 
start with Windows platform, then slowly move onto the Android platform,
 and afterwards, Mac OS X.</p>
<span>4. Why are iPads and iPhones unsupported, and when are they going to be supported?</span><br/>
<p>Now you might ask yourself when will iPad and iPhone be supported, and why we did not make it a high priority? Well, since our software will be cross-platform, we will need to ensure that its compatible with every OS and/or its distributions. However, porting our entire code base to iOS will require complete UI redesign, and will cause server incompatibility as well. Therefore, we will settle with Windows, and Linux distributions first (including Android), and afterwards, we will attempt to address this issue, and develop its software accordingly.</p>
<span>5. How will the funds be used?</span><br/>
<p>Our foremost goal is to recruit more team members to make this idea a reality; we've got the means to do it! We are also in search of programmers, server maintenance crew, as well as more graphic and UI designers. We aim at recruiting a team of different nationalities; combine their experiences, thoughts, and ideas to perfect our software to its maximum potential. On top of that, some funds will be used to rent additional server racks, sustaining more concurrent users. A complete team will allow us to build a better software for the masses.</p>
<span>6. What about overhead, how will the extra funds be used?</span><br/>
<p>Assuming that if the extra funds reaches $20,000, we'll use it to rent more robust servers and distribute its workload more evenly, to ensure maximum speed and reliability. What if more? Since system security and hijacking are also some of our major concerns... therefore, if the overhead reaches another $100,000, we will attempt to reinforce our security by developing end-to-end encryption algorithms.</p>
<span>7. Can I get a money back?</span><br/>
<p>Absolutely. Customer satisfaction has been our ethos since the very beginning. There's two ways to do it, the first method is to simply contact Indiegogo for your money back. The second way is to contact us directly; whichever way you choose are all fine by us.

</div></div>","Hi, this
is Corlens, a state-of-the-art collaboration software that help shapes the
future of education, schooling and business! We also revolutionize how people collaborate in distant places. The platform simplifies effective time management and balances
heavy workload, by providing a comprehensive set of tools to ease your mind and
satisfy your needs. Corlens Premier is loaded with a wide array of functions;
you can make the most of it - from group web browsing, application sharing, to
collaborative workspace, and presentation viewer.

Our
software benefits everyone, from education, small teams and charities, to large
corporations in different industry sectors. We believe that the society are currently adapting
to more technologically-oriented means, and by utilizing our modern server technologies,
robust communications systems and portable devices, we make long distance
collaboration a breeze! Take lead in communication over the next century today! 
This is a draft design of the software, hopefully help you get a better insight of what our future product might look like. Please note that the elements in this illustration are subject to change.



Education
is a crucial aspect of life, it empowers people to sustain the world in
different ways, and get the most value out of life. However, our approach to schooling are radically changing, and
by equipping online schools with the tools they need to make this happen, we help embrace the future of education! We help talented students pursue their
interests, and continue their education even when they’re abroad – CLICK,
LAUNCH, AND GO!On top of that, our distraction-free virtual classroom aids effective learning, with features such as timer, groups, whiteboard tools, alerts, and teachers' controls.
 


A unified
cross platform conferencing solution that empowers businesses to launch a
meeting or staff training sessions, anytime, anywhere. Our platform reinvents teleconferencing, and simplifies their approach
to effective management and communication. During the meeting, the
administration team can share documents, activate HD video or voice chat, and even
launch a presentation on the go! From small businesses to transnational corporations, our platform will benefit them greatly. For instance, we help them reduce travel costs and make decisions faster than ever.




International
charities often faces many challenges, the most common ones are dispersed
attention. With so many remote offices and home volunteers across the globe,
communication and information sharing can be laborious. While such issues are
easily addressed with our conferencing platform! Our platform reduces the
complexity and costs, even a non-techie could arrange a meeting, share
documents, and brainstorm ideas for their next move.
Certain types of charity will be eligible for a massive discount, while other charities, such as for-profit ones, are not eligible for discounts. We might consider giving away exclusive software licenses in the future; applies to non-profit charities only.

</h2><p><br/><a href=""http://www.tomorrowatschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tomorrow at School Association (TASA)</a> is a local organization based in Phnom Penh, which will open the first child-care center in December. We work with the urban poor, supporting them in escaping from poverty. We believe that education changes not only their personal lives but also their society and their country. We carefully listen to each person in the community and are patient in building their capacity and encouraging their development. This is what makes us different.<br/><br/>Our primary focus is children living in urban poor settlements of Phnom Penh. Children are often the most vulnerable. They have been discriminated against and ignored by society. Due to the situation of hopelessness the adults find themselves in, they often engage in drugs, drinking, and gambling which results in family violence, and the children become victimized.<br/><br/>TASA works to prevent the children from losing their belief in their future. We provide basic needs for children such as education and a proper diet for their age group based on international standards. At the same time we encourage the development of the capacity of their parents and the community in becoming more independent. Independency will allow them to solve problems by themselves, to improve their lives for the future. Our prime focus is to provide community development through supporting slum children, the future generation.<br/><br/>We want them to get free from poverty and to have choices in their decisions. We want children to have a dream for their future and have joy in their life. We want them to believe they are needed by their society.<br/><br/>Your support for Tomorrow at School Association can provide education for slum children, which will brighten their future and possibilities.</p><p><br/></p><h2><strong>Why Cambodia?</strong></h2><p><br/>While Phnom Penh’s economy has been growing rapidly over the past decade, the growing urban population, coupled with land insecurity, has been threatening to undermine stability for the disadvantaged. Those who are marginalised are not able to have a stable life, rather they are surviving hand-to-mouth. As a consequence, the weak are left to bear the burden; children. The difficulty of alleviating from poverty is believed to be due primarily to its particular history, which Cambodia traced.<br/><br/>The violent and destructive Khmer Rouge regime banned all traditional education activities. The Khmer Rouge closed down all the schools and teachers were outlawed; most of them didn’t survive the Khmer Rouge period.<br/><br/>The People’s Republic of Kampuchea which followed the fall of the Khmer Rouge faced an educational system which had to be recreated from almost nothing, there was a total lack of teachers, premises, books, and teaching equipment.<br/><br/>From an historical point of view, education in Cambodia is characterised by a sequence of disruptions. In comparison to the neighbouring countries Cambodia’s education system is still seen as being seriously handicapped by the recent history.<br/><br/>The historical tragedy, which destroyed the Cambodian education system, has still been casting a dark shadow on the education field in Cambodia.<br/><br/>In Anlong Kgnan slum, which is one of poorest areas in Phnom Penh, there are many infants, who are lacking in not only educational development but also in nutrition. As their parents are not aware of the importance of education, infants are often neglected. Infants are born much smaller than the world average and often times with birth defects and disabilites due to the maternal malnutrition of duration of the pregnancy and are growing up without enough nutrition.　Accordingly their physical strength is weak and their height is relatively small.</p><p><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448387390/ahd44liegysuhuuvozse.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448387811/w1vnf5kfpuyfegzjg0nx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448387771/a17d8vh8r2tgt9g1xkwv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/> </p><h2>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Sean Womack, I'm in Year 11 (10th grade) at <a href=""http://www.cheney.oxon.sch.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cheney School</a> in Oxford, UK. Recently, 20 other students and I were selected from ages 15-17 to go with <a href=""http://www.global-action.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Action</a> (Their mission is to facilitate learning for positive global change through tailored school expeditions and professional internships) to the Indian Himalayas and do amazing charity work - as well as to learn a lot and have some fun. This trip will be in July 2017 for approximately 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I'm launching this campaign because this trip is VERY expensive. Since we are contributing so much to charity (approx 65% of the total due), this trip will cost £3000 (~$4300) per person. So I need to start getting funding ASAP.</p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you are not only helping me get to India, but you are also helping the Tibetan communities that we will visit during the journey. If I get extra funding, that money will go to the other students in the group who are also trying to raise funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This whole trip costs about £50,000-£60,000 in all (that's for everyone - students, teachers and guides), so it's going to take a lot of work to get that money. I plan on getting a part-time job soon, but the first payment is due right away! The payments are spread out across many months, but the first one is right around the corner:</p> <ol>
<li><strike>£200 deposit (10th March 2016)</strike></li>
<li>£200 deposit (29th April 2016)</li>
<li>£1000 (1st November 2016)</li>
<li>£1600 (May 2017)</li>
</ol>This total includes visa fees, travel, immunizations, accommodation, equipment, food, and personal needs. But the reason it's such a large fee is because this is a charity organization and most of the money goes to Global Action's sponsored charities. I will be contributing to my goal as well, by getting a part-time job. In addition, all of the students will be working together to raise about 10% of the funds as a group. </div><div>When you donate, you will receive massive thanks from me, but also the knowledge that you've given to a worthy cause. I will be sure to thank every one of the contributors personally (see perks).</div> <div> <h3>What will we be doing?</h3> <p><b>Day 1: </b>We start in the UK and go through everything one final time to make sure we are all ready to go.</p>
<p><b>Day 2-3: </b>We take an overnight flight from London to New Delhi and then a domestic flight to Amritsar. We'll find our hotel and relax for the night.</p>

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a Muslim growing up in America, I learned my faith through the traditional methods of watching my parents, relatives, family, and friends. I remember watching my mom helping people in a selfless way. I remember vividly witnessing my father's interaction with people with a warm and welcoming smile. However, as I didn't have that interaction, I  learned my faith by watching my parents. Having that connection with my mom and dad while learning my faith was missing.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So when I became a mother of two beautiful children, I wanted something different. I wanted to offer something for my children that will build a bond around my faith. Like any mom out there, I bought DVDs for my children to watch at home, or in the car. I also purchased many books about being a good Muslim, and to understand the basics of Islam. My children did learn, but buying books and DVDs still had the disconnect I once felt when I was a child. These ways of learning did not help me as a mom to interact in a fun hands-on way with my children.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That is the heart of how my venture </span>began<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to start a company called Aspire Learning Tools,  that creates mindful games for spiritual kids. I wanted something engaging, fun, and interactive, while learning their faith! I wanted my children to experience making their own connection with Allah (God).

Who we are.....
Hello, we
are Peter Jordan and George O'Malley, and we are seeking election to Dail
Eireann in Co.Mayo 

We are
tired of experiencing bad representation and our county being neglected by our
own man, Taoiseach Enda Kenny together with 3 other government TDs
for the past 5 years. 
We believe that countless thousands others are also disillusioned. We know that if elected, even as independent TDs, we will have a far greater and more positive impact on Mayo's well being and it's future than Enda Kenny has had in his 40+ years as an elected TD, Minister and Taoiseach. 



Enda Kenny must go! 


We plan to unseat Enda Kenny and send a message to the entire country and to
FF/FG/Lab that we will not tolerate the further planned neglect and abuse in
County Mayo by those parties over the past 50+ years. Enda Kenny has been a TD for 41 years and has done nothing for the people of Mayo or the people of Ireland, only continually let us down domestically and internationally. 


His record really does speak for itself. Here is a man who sat by and watched Fianna Fail wreck our country and when given the opportunity to correct it, proved to be incapable of doing so, just a mere administrator for the troika and bondholders. If Ireland was a private company he would have got the chop 36 years ago.

It is time for a change. A change from - son of a TD  to national school teacher for 4 years, to TD. Let us not forget Enda's ""Contract with the People"". We need people with experience of life and business, with all of its ups and downs, experience of living beyond the walls of Dáil Éireann, but most of all we need elected officials who actually care about the people they represent. 



We can not let another generation of our greatest asset, our young, be forced to leave the country. This is not normal, it doesn't happen in other ""1st world"" countries. Mayo is often the county that comes off worst when we go through yet another bust in Ireland. Enda has been an elected TD through some of our most devastating economic depressions. 






Not just negative - We have plans too


We are not just looking to bash Enda Kenny and look for a protest vote. 

We have ideas, we have plans, we have experience and we have the unrelenting drive to make it happen. 


Mayo and the Western region in general have seen a chronic under investment or disinvestment in our key services and infrastructure. hospitals, roads, Knock airport, railway lines, IDA parks, rural Garda stations, doctors surgeries



We don't need to continue, if you have been to or live in Mayo you know all about it. 



Mayo doesn't look like a county with 4 TD's in power and it certainly doesn't look like a county that is home to the Taoiseach!


Below are some key objectives of George and Peter. We are ambitious, we do think big, its the least Mayo deserves after years of neglect.
 • THE RETENTION OF OUR SERVICES
(schools, hospitals, clinics, garda stations)
• N5 NORTH FROM SWINFORD TO BELMULLET
• A KNOCK FREE ZONE
similar to Shannon's
• A RING ROAD FOR BALLINA
• 10km RURAL RENEWAL TAX INCENTIVE AREA
with Knock airport as the epicentre
• THE WESTERN RAIL LINK
• THE UPGRADE OF THE R312
from Castlebar to Bellacorick
• A MAYO DEEP SEA PORT 



We will never apologise for fighting for what Mayo deserves. This is our county and if we do not take a stand now, there will be no one left here to fight for. 
  What we need from you.....
We need money, there is no easy way around it. We are not a big organisation with €1,000,000s at our disposal. We are supported by a loyal following of groups and individuals who like us want to see real change.

We need as many people to donate as possible. Even €1 will send a message to the establishment that you have had enough. It is as much about the numbers of donations we receive as the amount.

We ask everyone from Donegal to Cork from Galway to Dublin and all in between to help us by donating anything you can to give Enda Kenny a message he will never forget.

This is the only chance for people outside of Mayo to let Enda Kenny know he is not fit to hold office

It won't be easy, we know that, but we are going to fight as hard as we can to make sure Enda Kenny is not returned to government. 

Please support us in anyway you can. Share this on Facebook and Twitter if you cant afford to donate. Tell your friends, the ones who are here and the ones who have had to move away. 

Every Euro and Cent you donate will go towards leaflets, posters and press advertising as well as mail shots around the local communities throughout Mayo.",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We at Akili
Network believe <b>we can enrich the lives of
kids and their families in Kenya with quality educational entertainment content</b>.
</p>
<p>In 2012, we visited Kenya at the request of the Deputy
Chairman of the Kenyan Content Task Force to review some pro-bono work we did
on ways Kenya could grow their media sector.  When
we proposed doing some children’s programming at a meeting with the government
agency overseeing broadcasting, they said ""What would be of interest is if
you were to do a channel for children.” 
We were then invited to apply for a free-to-air digital broadcasting license.</p>
<p>We quickly learned that there are <b>18 million children under the age of 14</b>,<br/>and there is virtually <b>no quality programming</b> for them, and <b>no one is<br/>producing or distributing inspiring, educational programs</b> that our own<br/>children in the US have access to every day.  We knew
that formal education is incredibly important in Kenya and they did make primary
education free in 2003.  But having
worked in the business of children's educational content, we knew the incredible value of
informal education in the home. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459447980/shutterstock_176264801_copy_tqnf1l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>There is extensive scientific research that
supports the notion that informal educational content not only supports
school readiness and academic success in literacy, STEM and social-emotional
awareness, but develops inspiration, builds confidence and sparks imagination.
 In the US we take this for granted, since
this kind of content has existed for years and is widely distributed and
available.   </p>
<p>Our timing was truly auspicious: Kenya was poised to convert
from an old analog broadcasting system to an advanced digital one, offering the
possibility of many more channels.  We
concluded that there was going to be an incredible
opportunity to deliver much needed content for children in Kenya and the rest
of East Africa.</p>
<p>So we asked ourselves “How could we build a
sustainable business model that could reach the maximum number of children and
their care givers and support their informal educational needs? How can we give these kids and their families free and unlimited access to the kinds of content that positively impacts our own children's lives every day?”  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Akili Solution</b></p>
<p>We have been working on Akili Network (Akili means wisdom in Swahili)
for the last four years and have been issued a free-to-air broadcasting license
from the Communications Authority of Kenya. 
We’ve developed a detailed plan to bring the world’s best culturally
appropriate children’s content to Kenya and to produce
original local programs working with Kenya’s best creators, artists and
production companies. As English is one of two official languages and is
the language used in primary schools, the programs will primarily be broadcast in English.</p>
<p>We’ve assembled an amazing team of Kenyans
who are experts in their local domains and our global management team has
decades of experience developing this type of content with companies like
Scholastic, Nickelodeon and Living Books.</p>
<p>To reach the maximum number of children and
caregivers, our network will be free whether distributed to digital
televisions, mobile devices, tablets or computers.  By maximizing our reach of a large
underserved audience, we will support both our social impact goals and our
business goals. </p>
<p>
Our business model is commercial advertising <u>and</u>
the sale of behavior change communication (think a paid Public Service Announcement) airtime to NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and government ministries. We're also creating supplemental materials that will extend
their informal learning experiences into the classroom for teachers who wish to
use them, as well as materials for use at home by parents who desire free activities with real-world academic or social-emotional benefits for their
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Our business model is meant to be sustainable -- and if it succeeds in Kenya
we're poised to enter adjacent East African countries. </p>

<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding we're hoping to raise will help us acquire programs, purchase and install the equipment we've selected to broadcast across platforms, pay for the transmission of the channel and pay our team in Kenya and the US to finalize the ground work for our launch:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>We're looking to raise $600,000 dollars.</b> 
This will get us on the air and<br/>with the funding we've already raised from investors in the US and Kenya, it will close the gap and enable us to get to a self-sustaining business faster.  Any additional
funds we raise will be allocated to the development of
our long list of new local programs for preschool and school-aged children and their
families and caregivers. </li> <li>
Our perks are simple and celebrate your investment in this amazing
program. You can get some Akili Network swag, or <b>if you opt out of the swag, we'll pass the dollars saved on to give away Akili pencils, notebooks and soccer balls to kids in Kenya. </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
If
for some reason we aren't able to reach our goal, our funds go first and
foremost to purchase our broadcast equipment and focus on early childhood
programming only. We can launch with just this programming if we have to, but it
is our (and our audiences') goal to have the full offering of programs
for ages 2-14 at launch.<br/></span><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459692852/Akili_Pie_Chart_jdxbus.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>18 Million children and their families in Kenya will directly benefit from this venture. </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Additional benefits of Akili Network
will be: job creation and the growth of Kenya’s media sector, community respect
and involvement (an issue highly prized by most Kenyans), and a number of
important changes in behavior over time through our selection of programs,
including protecting the environment, gender equality, and health practices. </p>
<p>As our audience of children and
caregivers grows, we will be an important vehicle for NGOs and government
ministries for reaching this important audience with behavior change
communications.  </p>
<p>Our messages of positivity and
inspiration are the best way to defend against ignorance.  These children truly deserve the best of what
the world can offer.  </p>

Our management team has
experience leading many ventures in media and education, both large and small,
from producing children's programs and educational entertainment, to running successful
startups such as Living Books to developing award-winning television series'
(like <i>Peep and the Big Wide World</i>) to
publishing award-winning reading comprehension educational technology for use
in classrooms (ReadAbout for Scholastic) to acquiring the best programming for
children for Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Qubo and Discovery Kids.  The Kenyan members of our team have sold
advertising for one of the largest broadcasters in the country, have led
production for the country's Ministry of Information Communication and
Telecommunications and have created IP standards for the Kenya's media industry.
We even have a successful track record of doing business in Kenya. We know the
industry, the region and the audience.</div><div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have reduced the risk of the venture by extensive business planning, lining up agreements for the programming, establishing relationships with government ministries and production companies and assembling a world-class group of advisors and management team.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">All we need now is you!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Truly Akili Networks' biggest risk is not raising all the funding required to launch the channel. To mitigate this, we have decided that if there is a shortfall we will reduce the amount of programs we launch with and initially focus on just preschool programming.  <br/></span></p> <ul> <li>The risks to the business are tied to the speed at which we can grow our audience.  We have developed an extensive marketing and PR program that works with major outlets and on the ground with each of Kenya's 47 counties and their respective leadership to promote the network. </li>
<li>While there is occasional security instability in the region, we believe this venture is less affected by these events.   </li>
<li>Our senior leadership will be on the ground in Nairobi to manage Akili.  </li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We appreciate any investment you might consider, but even if you cannot, we would sincerely appreciate you sharing our venture with your own personal network:</p> <ul> <li>Please spread the word about what we are trying to do! You can easily use the <span style=""background-color: initial;"">sharing tools built right into Indiegogo.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We could really use some help executing across our social media channels - if this is of interest we'd love to talk.</span></li> </ul> </div> <p>We are incredibly passionate about this venture and hope you see the value in it.

you were to do a channel for children.” 
We were then invited to apply for a free-to-air digital broadcasting license.
We quickly learned that there are 18 million children under the age of 14,and there is virtually no quality programming for them, and no one isproducing or distributing inspiring, educational programs that our ownchildren in the US have access to every day.  We knew
that formal education is incredibly important in Kenya and they did make primary
education free in 2003.  But having
worked in the business of children's educational content, we knew the incredible value of
informal education in the home. 



There is extensive scientific research that
supports the notion that informal educational content not only supports
school readiness and academic success in literacy, STEM and social-emotional
awareness, but develops inspiration, builds confidence and sparks imagination.
 In the US we take this for granted, since
this kind of content has existed for years and is widely distributed and
available.   
Our timing was truly auspicious: Kenya was poised to convert
from an old analog broadcasting system to an advanced digital one, offering the
possibility of many more channels.  We
concluded that there was going to be an incredible
opportunity to deliver much needed content for children in Kenya and the rest
of East Africa.
So we asked ourselves “How could we build a
sustainable business model that could reach the maximum number of children and
their care givers and support their informal educational needs? How can we give these kids and their families free and unlimited access to the kinds of content that positively impacts our own children's lives every day?”  

The Akili Solution
We have been working on Akili Network (Akili means wisdom in Swahili)
for the last four years and have been issued a free-to-air broadcasting license
from the Communications Authority of Kenya. 
We’ve developed a detailed plan to bring the world’s best culturally
appropriate children’s content to Kenya and to produce
original local programs working with Kenya’s best creators, artists and
production companies. As English is one of two official languages and is
the language used in primary schools, the programs will primarily be broadcast in English.
We’ve assembled an amazing team of Kenyans
who are experts in their local domains and our global management team has
decades of experience developing this type of content with companies like
Scholastic, Nickelodeon and Living Books.
To reach the maximum number of children and
caregivers, our network will be free whether distributed to digital
televisions, mobile devices, tablets or computers.  By maximizing our reach of a large
underserved audience, we will support both our social impact goals and our
business goals. 

Our business model is commercial advertising and
the sale of behavior change communication (think a paid Public Service Announcement) airtime to NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) and government ministries. We're also creating supplemental materials that will extend
their informal learning experiences into the classroom for teachers who wish to
use them, as well as materials for use at home by parents who desire free activities with real-world academic or social-emotional benefits for their
kids.

Our business model is meant to be sustainable -- and if it succeeds in Kenya
we're poised to enter adjacent East African countries.

   What We Need & What You Get The funding we're hoping to raise will help us acquire programs, purchase and install the equipment we've selected to broadcast across platforms, pay for the transmission of the channel and pay our team in Kenya and the US to finalize the ground work for our launch:  
We're looking to raise $600,000 dollars. 
This will get us on the air andwith the funding we've already raised from investors in the US and Kenya, it will close the gap and enable us to get to a self-sustaining business faster.  Any additional
funds we raise will be allocated to the development of
our long list of new local programs for preschool and school-aged children and their
families and caregivers.  
Our perks are simple and celebrate your investment in this amazing
program. You can get some Akili Network swag, or if you opt out of the swag, we'll pass the dollars saved on to give away Akili pencils, notebooks and soccer balls to kids in Kenya. 



If
for some reason we aren't able to reach our goal, our funds go first and
foremost to purchase our broadcast equipment and focus on early childhood
programming only. We can launch with just this programming if we have to, but it
is our (and our audiences') goal to have the full offering of programs
for ages 2-14 at launch.

    The Impact 
18 Million children and their families in Kenya will directly benefit from this venture. 


Additional benefits of Akili Network
will be: job creation and the growth of Kenya’s media sector, community respect
and involvement (an issue highly prized by most Kenyans), and a number of
important changes in behavior over time through our selection of programs,
including protecting the environment, gender equality, and health practices. 
As our audience of children and
caregivers grows, we will be an important vehicle for NGOs and government
ministries for reaching this important audience with behavior change
communications.  
Our messages of positivity and
inspiration are the best way to defend against ignorance.  These children truly deserve the best of what
the world can offer.  

Our management team has
experience leading many ventures in media and education, both large and small,
from producing children's programs and educational entertainment, to running successful
startups such as Living Books to developing award-winning television series'
(like Peep and the Big Wide World) to
publishing award-winning reading comprehension educational technology for use
in classrooms (ReadAbout for Scholastic) to acquiring the best programming for
children for Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Qubo and Discovery Kids.  The Kenyan members of our team have sold
advertising for one of the largest broadcasters in the country, have led
production for the country's Ministry of Information Communication and
Telecommunications and have created IP standards for the Kenya's media industry.
We even have a successful track record of doing business in Kenya. We know the
industry, the region and the audience.
Here are some of the team bringing this to life:
Founders/Management Team:

Jeff Schon, CEO - 20+ years TV mgmt and production, Hearst, Living Books, Scholastic
Jesse Soleil, President - 20+ years of digital products and marketing, Scholastic, Massiverse, Porter Novelli
Gerry Gitonga, General Counsel, 15+ years of Kenyan IP and entertainment law
Dea Perez, Head of Programming, Nick, Cartoon Network, Discovery Kids


Advisors:

Charlie Deull, International Business Advisor; experience: Scholastic, The Hunger Project
Matt Finick, Consulting CFO; experience: Marvel, Reading Rainbow
Rafique Keshavjee, Education in Africa; experience: Aga Khan University
Andrea Miller, International TV; experience: Cartoon Network, TCM
Bruce Paisner, TV/Media Strategy; experience: Hearst, International Emmys
Priten Patel, East African Business Advisor; experience: Meditec, Vanguard Group



Risks & Challenges
We have reduced the risk of the venture by extensive business planning, lining up agreements for the programming, establishing relationships with government ministries and production companies and assembling a world-class group of advisors and management team.  All we need now is you!
Truly Akili Networks' biggest risk is not raising all the funding required to launch the channel. To mitigate this, we have decided that if there is a shortfall we will reduce the amount of programs we launch with and initially focus on just preschool programming.    The risks to the business are tied to the speed at which we can grow our audience.  We have developed an extensive marketing and PR program that works with major outlets and on the ground with each of Kenya's 47 counties and their respective leadership to promote the network. 
While there is occasional security instability in the region, we believe this venture is less affected by these events.   
Our senior leadership will be on the ground in Nairobi to manage Akili.   
   Other Ways You Can Help We appreciate any investment you might consider, but even if you cannot, we would sincerely appreciate you sharing our venture with your own personal network:  Please spread the word about what we are trying to do! You can easily use the sharing tools built right into Indiegogo.

We could really use some help executing across our social media channels - if this is of interest we'd love to talk.   We are incredibly passionate about this venture and hope you see the value in it. Thank you for your consideration and investment!Kindest regards,Jeff, Jesse and the entire Akili Network crew",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>Our genesis began with the recognition that in both our social and business lives we needed a simple tool to be effective at how we connect, share, communicate, interact and collaborate. Having worked with the solutions that are currently available, we concluded that something different was required to support what we desired. We wanted a tool that could reduce distractions and add meaning to how we live, work and play. Colabus revolutionizes the way people engage as it facilitates different interaction and communication styles so we are empowered to use our time more effectively. <div>

Our genesis began with the recognition that in both our social and business lives we needed a simple tool to be effective at how we connect, share, communicate, interact and collaborate. Having worked with the solutions that are currently available, we concluded that something different was required to support what we desired. We wanted a tool that could reduce distractions and add meaning to how we live, work and play. Colabus revolutionizes the way people engage as it facilitates different interaction and communication styles so we are empowered to use our time more effectively. 

Our Vision 
The World on Colabus. Make it accessible to all social and business collaborators.

</div><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Goxhill Primary School is
a small rural school in the county of North Lincolnshire in the UK. We teach
children of all abilities aged between 3 and 11. Goxhill is a small community
of about 2000 people on the banks of the Humber Estuary, close to the North Sea
coast. During World War 2 the US Airforce (USAAF Station 345) were stationed
there. There has been an Air Force base located in Goxhill since the First
World War. The school recognises this link utilising a propeller as part of its
logo.</p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Goxhill"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Goxhill</span></a>.</p>
<p>The school values every
opportunity, so where feasible it tries hard to make links with neighbouring
businesses and organisations. As a result of this, the opportunity to make
links with CERN, the world renowned scientific establishment based in Geneva,
Switzerland was something that we want to do our best to encourage. In 2015 we
were able to utilise links with CERN to arrange a visit, and 20 children took
the opportunity to go. During this visit, the staff from CERN were impressed by
the children's attitude and asked if we could pay a return visit to strengthen
links and develop the real world scientific content that links to the
children's learning and enable more primary schools to visit and to further
develop CERN's understand of the children's requirements and needs.  </p>
<p>We are going, and although
we have had 22 children agree to come, the cost is £350 per child. We are
aiming to raise £5000. This will enable us to reduce the costs to £150 per
child making the trip more affordable to the current cohort of pupils, whilst
allowing some funding to film a documentary of the children's experience.  </p>
<p>By contributing to this
funding campaign you will be inspiring the scientists of the future. We want
you to understand that by contributing or buying a perk, you can help the
child’s visit to the Large Hadron Collider. During our last visit in 2015 we
met Noble Prize winner Professor Ting, who took time to chat with our children.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>
<p>The total cost of the
trip per child is currently £350 (all included – flights, food, accommodation
etc.), but we would like to make the trip more affordable, so would like to
reduce the cost to £150. To do this, we would need £4400, but any money raised
will be used to reduce the cost to the children. The sum listed (£5000)
includes the cost of a documentary that we would also like to have produced. It
goes without saying that money raised will first go to reducing the cost to the
children first. The funding for the documentary will only be considered after
we have reached this target.</p>
<p>Any money raised over
the £5000 we are aiming for will be used to start funding next year’s visit to
CERN.</p>
<h3>The perks</h3>
<p>Up to £10 we get a thank
you at the end of the documentary</p>
<p>£10 to £30 buy a 'thank
you' letter from one of the children </p>
<p>£50 to £100 buy you a
premier showing of the documentary in the school</p>
<p>For £15 you can get a
photo of the children at CERN.</p>
<p>Business perks:</p>
<p>£50+ you will get a
letter of thank you from a child, a photo from the children at CERN and
'special thank you' on the documentary.</p>
<p>£100+ you will get a
letter of thank you from a child, a photo from the children at CERN with a

organisation's logo at the end of the documentary and your logo on the T Shirt
that the children will wear during the visit to CERN.</p>

</p>
<p>Not From Here: the International Students’ Cookbook aims to bring students from all around the world together, with every student's second favourite thing: Food! We have collected and curated recipes from students from every corner of the globe and are creating a wonderful cookbook of all their recipes so that you too can enjoy the tastes of their homes.</p>
<p>We want this cookbook to be more than just a cookbook, which is why we’ve added a personal touch. All our recipes are gathered from genuine students and each one includes a short personal description of why this recipe is special to the student and how it reminds them of home. Each recipe is unique and we’ve been truly overwhelmed by the submissions we’ve received: we have recipes that have been handed down from generation to generation, as well as recipes students make every time they are homesick just so they can have that little taste of home.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Money, Money, Money.</h3> <p></p>
<p>We want to produce the best cookbook possible for you to own and cook from! In order to do that we’ve been working hard to recreate all the recipes that have been submitted to us so that we can check them for quality, and so that our resident photographer can take lovely pictures of them to put in the cookbook. Obviously cooking all these recipes costs money, as well as printing a full colour cookbook so you can see the pictures in all of their glory. This is why we’re asking for your money, so that we can make a wonderful product for our customers (that’s you!).</p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our goal we’re going to do our best to publish as many cookbooks as possible. We really want to share the recipes we’ve collected with everyone, so we’re determined to get them out there no matter the financial barriers.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>It's Not Easy Being Us</h3> <p> </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges we have faced while producing our cookbook has been coping with the differences between cultures when it comes to cooking. For example finding some of the ingredients was a challenge, especially since some of them had different names in other languages! As well as this many of the different recipes came with different forms of measurement, some that we’d never seen before, so converting from these was again a difficulty we had to comprehend and overcome. This is one of the main reasons we wanted to cook all the recipes ourselves, so that we could face these cookery challenges ourselves first and then explain how we got round them within our cookbook to make it easier for you when you cook them.</p>
<p>We were also worried when we started out that we wouldn’t get enough recipes to fill out our cookbook. However we pushed hard and created a dedicated marketing campaign that meant that we got all different types recipes from all over the world and we’re now really pleased with the diversity and range of recipes that we have for you.</p>
<p>We are also determined to produce a quality product for our customers and this means spending a lot of time and money on design and production of the book. We don’t want to compromise on the quality of the book and are passionate about creating a great quality product for you.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Money Isn't Everything</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Not everyone can afford to donate and we appreciate that! If you want to help but aren’t able to donate the best thing you could do for us is to get the word out to as many people as possible. Share this page, like and share our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InternationalStudentsCookbook/?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/NFHCookbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nfhcookbook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nfhcookbook/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tumblr</a>. The more people talking about us the better, we want to be able to share our idea with as many people as possible and you can help us do that!</p>If we do not reach our funding goal, we have a backup plan. We will pursue creating the book in a digital form, for which we will still need your generous donations, and don't worry - you'll still get your perks!<br/><p></p></div>","Who Are We?

Each recipe is unique and we’ve been truly overwhelmed by the submissions we’ve received: we have recipes that have been handed down from generation to generation, as well as recipes students make every time they are homesick just so they can have that little taste of home.   Money, Money, Money. 
We want to produce the best cookbook possible for you to own and cook from! In order to do that we’ve been working hard to recreate all the recipes that have been submitted to us so that we can check them for quality, and so that our resident photographer can take lovely pictures of them to put in the cookbook. Obviously cooking all these recipes costs money, as well as printing a full colour cookbook so you can see the pictures in all of their glory. This is why we’re asking for your money, so that we can make a wonderful product for our customers (that’s you!).
Even if we don’t reach our goal we’re going to do our best to publish as many cookbooks as possible. We really want to share the recipes we’ve collected with everyone, so we’re determined to get them out there no matter the financial barriers.

    It's Not Easy Being Us  
One of the biggest challenges we have faced while producing our cookbook has been coping with the differences between cultures when it comes to cooking. For example finding some of the ingredients was a challenge, especially since some of them had different names in other languages! As well as this many of the different recipes came with different forms of measurement, some that we’d never seen before, so converting from these was again a difficulty we had to comprehend and overcome. This is one of the main reasons we wanted to cook all the recipes ourselves, so that we could face these cookery challenges ourselves first and then explain how we got round them within our cookbook to make it easier for you when you cook them.
We were also worried when we started out that we wouldn’t get enough recipes to fill out our cookbook. However we pushed hard and created a dedicated marketing campaign that meant that we got all different types recipes from all over the world and we’re now really pleased with the diversity and range of recipes that we have for you.
We are also determined to produce a quality product for our customers and this means spending a lot of time and money on design and production of the book. We don’t want to compromise on the quality of the book and are passionate about creating a great quality product for you.   Money Isn't Everything 

Not everyone can afford to donate and we appreciate that! If you want to help but aren’t able to donate the best thing you could do for us is to get the word out to as many people as possible. Share this page, like and share our facebook, twitter, instagram and tumblr. The more people talking about us the better, we want to be able to share our idea with as many people as possible and you can help us do that!If we do not reach our funding goal, we have a backup plan. We will pursue creating the book in a digital form, for which we will still need your generous donations, and don't worry - you'll still get your perks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Pencils</h3>
<p>Education is a right of every child, not just the privileged few. For children within the slum communities in Lagos, quality education seems beyond their reach and they often make up the over 10.3 million out-of-school children in Nigeria. With increased economic hardship, more children are dropping out of school as a result of their parent's inability to fund their education, and most government facilities are over-stretched and often not well equipped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vivaville International Schools was founded in August 2017 by Joseph Jikeme, a development worker, with years of experience in the non-governmental sector. Vivaville International Schools (BN 2535865) is registered with the Corporate Affair Commission of the Federal Republic of NIgeria, and it is structured to accommodate indigent children from lower and middle class families, whose parents cannot afford the expensive school fees of regular private schools, and doesn't feel comfortable with the standard of education available in public schools. Our Founder, Joseph Jikeme, who once dropped out of school due to finance, understands the need to create an affordable educational system that meets international standard for the children in slum communities such as Bariga LCDA in Lagos State, where the school is located.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Project Pencils is designed to enable 100 children access this tuition-free education being offered by Vivaville International Schools, by providing them with school supplies for one academic session and one nutritious meal every school day. Our research within the community has shown that most of these children are dropping out of school as a result of lack of funds, and vast majority don't eat any meal that contains at least four food groups. We believe that providing this tuition-free education, along with school supplies and a meal every school day will encourage increased registration into primary school and also encourage these young children to learn adequately.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With our low-cost running strategy, a donor can take on the financing of a child's annual academic session for just US$80, and we desire to have at least 100 students at the start of the new session in September, hence the need to start this crowdfunding. Donor support will ensure that these children don't miss a day of school, don't go a full day without eating, don't spend their school hours hawking to support their families, and are not exposed to dangers when left unsupervised by their parent during the hours they are supposed to be in school. Your effort towards this project will foster a life changing effect for these young children, who with your consistent support will be guaranteed access to education for better chances of becoming leaders in the nearest future.</p>

<li>Medium Plus LLC is a company created and led by Nick Davis, a bartender and sommelier based in Seattle. Nick has a background in bars and restaurants, and decided to venture out on his own in May of 2015, powered by the spirit of entrepreneurship and challenge. </li>
<li>The name Medium Plus comes from an ambiguous term in wine-tasting vernacular, in reference to an 'elevated' condition of wine, either in color, aroma or structure. In that tone, the mission of Medium Plus is a 'pursuit of elevated wine and cocktails'.</li>
<li>Medium Plus features a spectrum of offerings, including fine wine and cocktail service for private events, educational wine and food presentations, and specialized beverage education for individuals and groups.</li>

<p><b>What is this Indiegogo product, in a few words?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This handbook will cover creative and unique strategies for<b><i> how to learn about wine</i></b> on an elevated level.</li>
<li>Nick was taught some of these strategies while working in bars and restaurants, and in study groups with other sommeliers. He also created some strategies by necessity, while intensely studying for the Advanced Sommelier exam. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>What will this handbook not cover?</b></p>
<ul><li>This is not another exhaustive encyclopedia about the vast world of wine. Those awesome books have already been written! Rather, this is a working toolkit of <b>learning-and-research strategies</b>, intended to assist any enthusiastic student of wine. Select topics from around the world of wine will be referenced in-depth, for the purposes of illustrating these strategies.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Past Medium Plus Event: A French Wine Feature at Eden Hill"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/511/865/a44426e4094dadaf1f3bec01d4852e52_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1457656620&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=2cca81f73ebd13f5502e93e4d2cab25e"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Past Medium Plus Event: A French Wine Feature at Eden Hill</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p><b>Who is this for? </b></p>
<ul>
<li>This handbook is written with the <b>beverage professional or serious enthusiast</b> in mind. Many of the topics covered will be very useful for those undertaking the ever-popular sommelier exams, although the subject matter will be applicable and relevant to anyone seeking to elevate their working knowledge of wine, in the areas of theory, tasting and service.  </li>
<li>
<b>Most importantly</b>, by using these strategies to gain better knowledge and confidence with wine, readers will become even better enthusiasts and sommeliers, <i><b>in the service</b></i> of their guests, friends and colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How will readers use the handbook? </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Following an overview introduction to the world of wine from the sommelier's perspective, the guide will dive into specific study strategies (see a list of topics below).</li>
<li>One such strategy is memorization. The handbook will explain a memory technique in reference to a wine region, for example, ""Memorizing the 1855 Classification for Bordeaux"". Once learned, students can then independently apply that memory technique to any wine region of interest, perhaps the Crus of Burgundy, or islands of Greece. It's the old, ""teach a person to fish"" trick!</li>
<li>Another example would be pronunciations. The handbook will go into depth on strategies for learning Italian pronunciation. Those tools can then be used to explore any foreign language, in relation to wine.</li>
<li>When appropriate, written topics will be paired with a video accompaniment. From Champagne service to screen-captures of hyper-efficient internet research, these visual aides will cover the gaps that plain text leaves behind.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why is this product unique and different?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Most wine books are filled to the brim with information, without a user's manual for how to unpack the information. <b>This is that manual</b>.</li>
<li>Many of the strategies and learning techniques listed in the handbook will be <b>abstract, and off the beaten path</b>. To achieve remarkable results, remarkable methods are often required!</li>
<li>Things like <b>flashcards and rote-memory drills will be avoided</b>, with a focus instead on 'deep-down learning tools', which foster knowledge-retention by using the creative areas of the brain. A succinct example would be: 'trying to intensely memorize a wine list', versus 'learning classic producers by creating a wine list from scratch'.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><b>- Theory: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Producers</b>: the foundation of the wine-world itself, winemakers are at the heart and soul of every bottle! By learning about producers first, the rest of wine-theory falls into place with surprising ease. Effective study strategies for theory will reference and emphasize producers throughout.</li>
<li>
<b>Regions</b>: starting with the sixteen essential countries for classic-wine, dive into each and discover the truly important aspects that set specific regions apart, and link others together.</li>
<li>
<b>Memory</b>: learn Nick's 'Story-Palace' technique, based on the famed 'Memory Palace', to learn and retain unlimited points of raw wine-theory data along with relevant context. Add in 'spaced repetition', 'the Major System', and 'Visual Memory', and you'll be Rainman-level in no time. No flash-cards needed!!</li>
<li>
<b>How It's Made, with 1-Page Guides</b>: getting down to the nitty-gritty of winemaking methods from around the world, including regional terms and classic examples. But wait, there's more! It will all be done with simple 1-Page explanations and diagrams.</li>
<li>
<b>Administration of a theory study-group</b>: make leaps and bounds in your theory knowledge with the power of friendship. Tips on what to study, effective frequency, and how to administer any size group.</li>
<li>
<b>Wine Business Nuts &amp; Bolts</b>: get your mind right, on all the business terms from margin to pour cost and beyond. Learn about the back-end side of wine sales, and discover how wine really gets from grape to glass.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Grape Personalities</b>: a unique visual-presentation of the 40 most-important grapes and wine styles, which can be considered 'classics'.</li>
<li>
<b>Deductive Method (aka 'blind tasting')</b>: Nick's Reverse-Pyramid approach for accurate and thorough analysis of a wine, leading to conclusions on grape variety, climate, winemaking style and age.</li>
<li>
<b>Ultra-Grid</b>: diving deep into deductive tasting using the 'ultra grid', which accounts for every important aspect of a wine, with cause and effect, from color-influence to structure to 'deliciousness', and more.

<p>""I reached out to Nick to ask for help in tasting and theory after I didn't pass the certified exam. He put me on a curriculum that focused on the areas that I needed to work on and assigned me homework each week that emphasized my weaknesses and turned them into strengths. </p>
<p>Nick has developed his own way of teaching that doesn't revolve around staring at a book and trying to memorize villages, regions, and terms, and it's incredibly helpful. He knows how to train your brain to really retain information and not just memorize for a test. He also has a great way of deductive tasting that expands on the CMS grids and breaks down how to get to a conclusion using clues that the wine is giving you.  </p>
<p>I highly recommend hiring Nick if you need help with anything in the beverage world, not just wine! He is full of knowledge and loves to help other people learn right along with him.""  </p>

<p>“Last year, Nick Davis and I spent hours together studying feverishly for the Advanced Sommelier exam. His awesome determination to learn the material was only bested by his insistence on investigating the process of learning itself. Passing the exam on his first attempt speaks to the effectiveness of his method, something I’ve seen him develop and evolve over the past year. If his success is any measure of the benefits his practice offers, this is a venture worth supporting. In addition, we both came to see tremendous value in the power of camaraderie and fraternity to promote our studies.

Medium Plus LLC is a company created and led by Nick Davis, a bartender and sommelier based in Seattle. Nick has a background in bars and restaurants, and decided to venture out on his own in May of 2015, powered by the spirit of entrepreneurship and challenge. 
The name Medium Plus comes from an ambiguous term in wine-tasting vernacular, in reference to an 'elevated' condition of wine, either in color, aroma or structure. In that tone, the mission of Medium Plus is a 'pursuit of elevated wine and cocktails'.
Medium Plus features a spectrum of offerings, including fine wine and cocktail service for private events, educational wine and food presentations, and specialized beverage education for individuals and groups.

Nick Davis, of Medium Plus
What is this Indiegogo product, in a few words?

This handbook will cover creative and unique strategies for how to learn about wine on an elevated level.
Nick was taught some of these strategies while working in bars and restaurants, and in study groups with other sommeliers. He also created some strategies by necessity, while intensely studying for the Advanced Sommelier exam. 

What will this handbook not cover?
This is not another exhaustive encyclopedia about the vast world of wine. Those awesome books have already been written! Rather, this is a working toolkit of learning-and-research strategies, intended to assist any enthusiastic student of wine. Select topics from around the world of wine will be referenced in-depth, for the purposes of illustrating these strategies.

Past Medium Plus Event: A French Wine Feature at Eden Hill
Who is this for? 

This handbook is written with the beverage professional or serious enthusiast in mind. Many of the topics covered will be very useful for those undertaking the ever-popular sommelier exams, although the subject matter will be applicable and relevant to anyone seeking to elevate their working knowledge of wine, in the areas of theory, tasting and service.  

Most importantly, by using these strategies to gain better knowledge and confidence with wine, readers will become even better enthusiasts and sommeliers, in the service of their guests, friends and colleagues.

How will readers use the handbook? 

Following an overview introduction to the world of wine from the sommelier's perspective, the guide will dive into specific study strategies (see a list of topics below).
One such strategy is memorization. The handbook will explain a memory technique in reference to a wine region, for example, ""Memorizing the 1855 Classification for Bordeaux"". Once learned, students can then independently apply that memory technique to any wine region of interest, perhaps the Crus of Burgundy, or islands of Greece. It's the old, ""teach a person to fish"" trick!
Another example would be pronunciations. The handbook will go into depth on strategies for learning Italian pronunciation. Those tools can then be used to explore any foreign language, in relation to wine.
When appropriate, written topics will be paired with a video accompaniment. From Champagne service to screen-captures of hyper-efficient internet research, these visual aides will cover the gaps that plain text leaves behind.

Why is this product unique and different?

Most wine books are filled to the brim with information, without a user's manual for how to unpack the information. This is that manual.
Many of the strategies and learning techniques listed in the handbook will be abstract, and off the beaten path. To achieve remarkable results, remarkable methods are often required!
Things like flashcards and rote-memory drills will be avoided, with a focus instead on 'deep-down learning tools', which foster knowledge-retention by using the creative areas of the brain. A succinct example would be: 'trying to intensely memorize a wine list', versus 'learning classic producers by creating a wine list from scratch'.


Past M+ Event: The Seattle Premier of Somm: Into The Bottle, with Madeline Puckette of WineFolly.com
Topics to be covered in the handbook:
- A mindset for the modern beverage professional: 

Humility: (anonymous) short stories of the best and worst personalities from the wine world.
Professionalism: notes on attire, attitude, candor and kindness.
Enthusiasm: thoughts on 'catching the bug', and getting ecstatic about wine.
Test Taking: removing fear and staying strong - from the workplace to the venue on exam day.

- Theory: 


Producers: the foundation of the wine-world itself, winemakers are at the heart and soul of every bottle! By learning about producers first, the rest of wine-theory falls into place with surprising ease. Effective study strategies for theory will reference and emphasize producers throughout.

Regions: starting with the sixteen essential countries for classic-wine, dive into each and discover the truly important aspects that set specific regions apart, and link others together.

Memory: learn Nick's 'Story-Palace' technique, based on the famed 'Memory Palace', to learn and retain unlimited points of raw wine-theory data along with relevant context. Add in 'spaced repetition', 'the Major System', and 'Visual Memory', and you'll be Rainman-level in no time. No flash-cards needed!!

How It's Made, with 1-Page Guides: getting down to the nitty-gritty of winemaking methods from around the world, including regional terms and classic examples. But wait, there's more! It will all be done with simple 1-Page explanations and diagrams.

Administration of a theory study-group: make leaps and bounds in your theory knowledge with the power of friendship. Tips on what to study, effective frequency, and how to administer any size group.

Wine Business Nuts & Bolts: get your mind right, on all the business terms from margin to pour cost and beyond. Learn about the back-end side of wine sales, and discover how wine really gets from grape to glass.


Past M+ Event: The Walla Walla Premier of Somm: Into The Bottle, at the Gesa Powerhouse Theatre
- Tasting: 


Grape Personalities: a unique visual-presentation of the 40 most-important grapes and wine styles, which can be considered 'classics'.

Deductive Method (aka 'blind tasting'): Nick's Reverse-Pyramid approach for accurate and thorough analysis of a wine, leading to conclusions on grape variety, climate, winemaking style and age.

Ultra-Grid: diving deep into deductive tasting using the 'ultra grid', which accounts for every important aspect of a wine, with cause and effect, from color-influence to structure to 'deliciousness', and more. Learn to work with the grid based on priorities, and eventually use it to describe a wine in four-minutes flat.

Administration of a tasting study-group: Notes on how to supercharge your tasting skills by working with friends. From tech tools used to effectively manage large groups to specific curricula for effective study, you will be able to have the best tasting group around!

- Service: 

Effective and gracious wine service, in the hospitality of guests and friends: how to converse about wine, so that everyone wins.
Service Situations: how to stay in the game, even when things go wrong.
Tools of the trade: a look a the essentials and extraneous items to have on hand for great service.
Still Wine, Champagne and Decanting service: in-depth videos, step-by-step, with multiple camera angles.
How to correctly (and safely) polish fine stemware.
How to correctly (and safely) carry a tray full of stemware.

<h3 style=""letter-spacing: normal;""><b>Research in C. elegans </b></h3>
</div><p>Our names are Andrew Lee and Kai Hin Lui. We are two young aspiring scientists at Stuyvesant High School, interested in the biology behind our memories. At our school, we experiment with a species of roundworms called <i>C. elegans</i>, and we study the effects of certain genetic mutations on memory retention. With the guide of two scientists, Dr Hemal Pathak and Dr Jun Liang, we have begun characterizing the behavior of <i>C. elegans</i>, but we are unable to perform tests at a deeper, molecular level due to a lack of funding. As two ambitious students, we need your help to experiment and further pursue our scientific endeavors.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463871170/worms-lo-res_hpdr1j.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 496px;""/></p><p>Image by Dustin Updike</p><p>Our goal through this campaign is to acquire and utilize the tools necessary for performing advanced molecular techniques. These techniques involve disrupting some of the signaling pathways important to healthy biological systems. Tweaking certain components in these pathways can create abnormalities in an otherwise healthy, normal organism, allowing us to better understand the roles these components normally play. Using the techniques provided by your funding, we can systematically screen for the molecular components underlying memory formation and retention.</p><p>Healthy, normally functioning molecular pathways are crucial to evade diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. However, the pathways that lead to many of the symptoms in these diseases are not fully understood. Much of our research is dedicated to finding the pathway in which a certain protein regulates memory retention. We hope our findings can shed light on these enigmatic pathways to provide a basis of knowledge for future research and, hopefully, development of treatments. <br/></p><p>Using a program called WormLab, we can track the memory retention of <i>C. elegans</i> over time. After performing an assay that conditions <i>C. elegans</i> to associate a scent with food, we record the <i>C. elegans</i>’ movement and use WormLab to translate their movement into data. If we quantify the movement of these worms over time, we can develop trends of their behavior to see the strength of their memories. From this, we can compare how well different worm mutants retain memories and discern the role of the gene that was mutated.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F42qOK6b_1pc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D42qOK6b_1pc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F42qOK6b_1pc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>We are so thankful for any contribution you make that will help us conduct research at a professional level!

</h3><p>We are trained, guided, and supported by<b> </b>two scientists, Dr. Hemal Pathak and Dr. Jun Liang. Dr. Pathak and Dr. Liang have both performed these molecular techniques many times in the past and are knowledgeable in <i>C. elegans</i>  maintenance and experimentation. Both are successful in their respective fields. Dr. Pathak is a neuroscientist who has been published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Dr. Liang has currently obtained a major grant from the National Institute of Health to study the effects of stress on the longevity of <i>C. elegans</i>. Both are experts at what they do and know how to lead us two growing scientists.</p><p>As students, we have also garnered experience in our years at Stuyvesant High School. In addition to basic biology and chemistry courses, we have taken an accelerated<b> </b>research class that taught us common laboratory techniques and allowed us to complete independent studies of our own. Kai Hin studied the effects of melatonin on <i>Brassica rapa</i> (mustard plant) growth and found that melatonin is sufficient for increased plant stem height. In a study using the planarian <i>Dugesia tigrina</i>, Andrew found that conditioning of <i>Ginkgo biloba</i> extract and egg yolk increases memory retention in the posterity of <i>Dugesia tigrina</i>.<br/></p><p>We have also taken two semesters of college-leveled biology, molecular biology, and chemistry; and a semester in neuroscience with a particular focus at the cellular and molecular level.</p><p></p><p><i>Relevant Links </i></p><p>Dr Jun Liang - <a href=""http://faculty.bmcc.cuny.edu/faculty/fp.jsp?f=jrice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://faculty.bmcc.cuny.edu/faculty/fp.jsp?f=jrice</a></p><p>Dr Hemal Pathak - <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211568/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211568/</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 30px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Community Impact</span></p><p>Funding two students probably doesn’t seem like it will have a big impact at first, but many other students in our school are involved as well.

Our names are Andrew Lee and Kai Hin Lui. We are two young aspiring scientists at Stuyvesant High School, interested in the biology behind our memories. At our school, we experiment with a species of roundworms called C. elegans, and we study the effects of certain genetic mutations on memory retention. With the guide of two scientists, Dr Hemal Pathak and Dr Jun Liang, we have begun characterizing the behavior of C. elegans, but we are unable to perform tests at a deeper, molecular level due to a lack of funding. As two ambitious students, we need your help to experiment and further pursue our scientific endeavors.Image by Dustin UpdikeOur goal through this campaign is to acquire and utilize the tools necessary for performing advanced molecular techniques. These techniques involve disrupting some of the signaling pathways important to healthy biological systems. Tweaking certain components in these pathways can create abnormalities in an otherwise healthy, normal organism, allowing us to better understand the roles these components normally play. Using the techniques provided by your funding, we can systematically screen for the molecular components underlying memory formation and retention.Healthy, normally functioning molecular pathways are crucial to evade diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's. However, the pathways that lead to many of the symptoms in these diseases are not fully understood. Much of our research is dedicated to finding the pathway in which a certain protein regulates memory retention. We hope our findings can shed light on these enigmatic pathways to provide a basis of knowledge for future research and, hopefully, development of treatments. Using a program called WormLab, we can track the memory retention of C. elegans over time. After performing an assay that conditions C. elegans to associate a scent with food, we record the C. elegans’ movement and use WormLab to translate their movement into data. If we quantify the movement of these worms over time, we can develop trends of their behavior to see the strength of their memories. From this, we can compare how well different worm mutants retain memories and discern the role of the gene that was mutated.We are so thankful for any contribution you make that will help us conduct research at a professional level! Really, it means a lot for providing us such memories.
Professional Guidance
We are trained, guided, and supported by two scientists, Dr. Hemal Pathak and Dr. Jun Liang. Dr. Pathak and Dr. Liang have both performed these molecular techniques many times in the past and are knowledgeable in C. elegans  maintenance and experimentation. Both are successful in their respective fields. Dr. Pathak is a neuroscientist who has been published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Dr. Liang has currently obtained a major grant from the National Institute of Health to study the effects of stress on the longevity of C. elegans. Both are experts at what they do and know how to lead us two growing scientists.As students, we have also garnered experience in our years at Stuyvesant High School. In addition to basic biology and chemistry courses, we have taken an accelerated research class that taught us common laboratory techniques and allowed us to complete independent studies of our own. Kai Hin studied the effects of melatonin on Brassica rapa (mustard plant) growth and found that melatonin is sufficient for increased plant stem height. In a study using the planarian Dugesia tigrina, Andrew found that conditioning of Ginkgo biloba extract and egg yolk increases memory retention in the posterity of Dugesia tigrina.We have also taken two semesters of college-leveled biology, molecular biology, and chemistry; and a semester in neuroscience with a particular focus at the cellular and molecular level.Relevant Links Dr Jun Liang - http://faculty.bmcc.cuny.edu/faculty/fp.jsp?f=jriceDr Hemal Pathak - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2211568/Community ImpactFunding two students probably doesn’t seem like it will have a big impact at first, but many other students in our school are involved as well. We run a club at Stuyvesant called the Neuroscience Club that meets weekly and is open to all students. We discuss current neuroscience literature, guide students toward independent research, find labs for students to work for, and provide them basic laboratory maintenance skills of C. elegans at our workspace. With the funding that you graciously provide, the strains that we purchase will be available for the use of any student as well as any materials or tools for students to use, learn, and experiment with. We believe hands-on learning is critical for building scientific literacy and thinking, and the money gathered here will be crucial underpinnings for the students in our club and at our school. This kind of unique experience is not something students can easily learn through the school curriculum. Please support us to help create a legacy for scientific research for years to come!The tools and materialsThe money from this campaign will mainly go towards building and purchasing plasmids and reagents for RNA interference, and transgenic C. elegans on which these techniques will be performed. Basic culturing tools such as petri dishes, Nematode Growth Media (agar), and a microscope will also be bought.The specifics:Nematode Growth Media stock - $1506 cm petri dish stock - $150E.coli OP50 bacteria (food source for C. elegans) - $30Various C. elegans transgenic strains - $1500RNAi transformation solutions - $95095% ethanol, 120mL - $2015mL conical tubes and rack - $25Amscope - LED Trinocular Zoom Stereo Microscope 3.5X-90X - $500

To describe me simply: I love to try everything! Curious by nature, I am fascinated by everything around me, and learning for me is bliss! ^^I am a designer and stylist but have always been interested in collaboration, the exchange of skills and knowledge, and the arts. Always keen to learn, I am self-taught in a number of areas such as nutrition and eco-living. I create jewellery and clothing but also enjoy expressing myself through music, drawing, photography, and other arts. I am passionate about life, creativity, people, and the world we live in, and want to find a way to share this passion with others and to encourage the development of potential.I created the Brainstorm Factory because many people, like me, do not have the space to practice their art. I wanted to create a place that would allow people to express themselves within a welcoming and conducive atmosphere. This is also a space to exchange ideas, techniques, to be inspired, make discoveries, or simply to enjoy!Equipment and materials are available free of charge enabling anyone to try their hand at something new. All are welcome, whether beginner or professional, and of any age.The Brainstorm Factory has three rooms: one for sewing, jewellery, seminars, meetings, and brainstorming sessions, another for music, relaxation, and therapy, with the main room dedicated to all aspects of visual art as well as extra space for seminars and other happenings.The goal is to learn, facilitate wonderful exchanges, and to express creativity while also respecting the environment.Seminars will focus on a variety of topics: artistic technique, food and nutrition, community building and support, the environment, the possibilities are endless! We will be open to ideas and will focus on the wants and needs of participants. Some seminars will also be transmitted online.Happenings are activities where people can gather to express themselves, learn something new, and have fun! Examples of this would be music jams, story circles, potluck meals, and community outreach events.For some events we might encourage a small fee (5 - 10$) or donation to cover special materials or circumstances, but the aim is always to remain as free and accessible to all as possible.The Brainstorm Factory needs you!I strongly believe that this project will have a positive impact on the community. Knowledge, learning, and the rights of creative expression should be accessible to all, not just those with money and resources (because as we know, art and learning can be expensive).A project like this can educate, help develop cultural and intellectual faculties, and encourage different perspectives about life and the world we live in. An educated and self-aware society is a healthy society. Ideally knowledge, learning, and the means to creative self-expression should be accessible to everyone. This is why it is my intent that access to the Brainstorm Factory and use of equipment and materials will be free wherever possible. To achieve this I need your help! If we give a little together we can gather a lot. With your donation you have the power to create a positive impact!(Picture of the Inverted Halloween event where we handed out candy and good vibes to people on the streets!)Let's talk about moneyThe Brainstorm Factory is a three room space in the heart of Old Quebec City.Rent is 574.88$ per month (6898.56$ per year).Commercial insurance is 574.88$ per yearI spent more than 2000$ on the basic equipment and materials that are currently in the space. This includes sewing machines, clothing materials, jewellery materials, furniture, easels, paint, canvasses, and other artistic supplies.In total I’ve spent 9420.56$ for a basic year. I have gladly funded this out of my own pocket because I truly believe in the positive impact of such a community space, but I need your help to keep it going!My goal here is to raise 6215$ to cover rent and materials for a few months. If we manage to exceed the amount that will be even better! ^^ because it would allow us to expand our range of equipment and materials, and to initiate more community outreach projects.Other ways to helpThe Brainstorm Factory is a place to nurture open minds - a space with no barriers - the goal simply to learn and create wonderful exchanges. It is very important for me to express my creativity with a minimum of harm and waste to the planet, and to encourage others to do so too. We want to avoid abusing resources for personal pleasure so will endeavour to do everything with respect for the environment and the local community. In this way too you can help!!We are called the Brainstorm Factory for a reason! This is a place of ideas and creation so if you have any ideas or expertise you'd like to share or exchange with us please do get in touch!The Brainstorm Factory is based on the principle of sharing <3 I am always on the lookout for second-hand equipment and materials, or ways to facilitate exchange. My own equipment is there and free to use, so why not yours also! If you have any material lying around at home why not come and share it with other artists?!! Maybe you have equipment that you do not use but that someone else could make great use of (or vice versa) !The desired material is myriad! It could be art materials, old clothing/material, sewing tools, music instruments... everything is accepted! So this is it! I appeal to you to become a part of this project for fulfilment and enjoyment whether you are local to Quebec or not!If you have things to give, share, or donate: email me!! Of course, even your time is precious! Besides, even if you are not an artist you can always come ''chill'' with us, no matter your age! :DWe are open at least five days a week, including weekends, with the possibility of premises rental on any day of the week for private events or functions.Hope to see you there: to share, exchange, and experience!Thank you all for your time and consideration.**See the perks at the botom of the pageMon nom est Émie Jacques, fondatrice de Brainstorm Factory et de la marque A girl and A pig.Un simple mot pour me décrire;Je suis une touche à tout (comme dirait un Québécois) ! Curieuse de nature, je me suis toujours intéressée à tout ce qu'il y a autour de moi. Apprendre est pour moi le bonheur absolu ! Je suis designer et styliste de formation, mais je me suis toujours intéressée à l'échange collectif et les arts. J’étudie plusieurs domaines de façon autodidacte telles la nutrition, l’écologie, et l’autosuffisance. De plus, je fais de la création de vêtements et de bijoux et je pratique la musique, le dessin et plusieurs autres arts. Bref, tout me fascine et je voulais trouver une façon de partager cette passion avec d’autres pour leur permettre de développer leur potentiel.J’ai créé ce local, car plusieurs personnes sont en appartement et n’ont pas nécessairement l'espace pour pratiquer leur art. Je voulais donc créer un endroit qui permettrait aux gens de faire tout cela dans une belle atmosphère. Ce lieu permettra, entre autre, d’échanger entre artistes et suscitera l’apprentissage, la création et le perfectionnement.Le matériel sera accessible GRATUITEMENT pour permettre aux gens d’essayer de nouvelles techniques de création. Que vous soyez débutant ou professionnel, tout le monde est la bienvenue.Peinture réalisée au Brainstorm factory par Francois Brisson Le local est séparé en trois espaces différents.Pièce #1 :  Couture par le biais de 5 machines à coudre, fils, aiguilles, tissus sur place ainsi que  la création de bijoux Pièce #2:  Musique avec différents instruments disponibles pour « jammer» en groupe.Pièce #3: Art visuel tels le dessin et la peinture. Table à dessin, 3 chevalets et pots de peinture accessibles à tous. Vous ne pratiquez pas d’art? Ce n’est pas grave, car ces pièces serviront aussi pour les conférences à prix modique ( 5$ ou 10$ par personne) avec possiblité de Webinar. Les conférences porteront sur divers sujets:art (comment créer sa propre peinture, technique de peinture à l’eau, l’acrylique, les ombres et lumières etc.),alimentation ( crudivorisme, végétarisme, déshydratation des aliments), la photographie, la mode, les green communities, le sport, le jeûne, les tiny-houses etc. Bref, les possibilités sont infinies. Tout dépendra du nombre de personnes qui seront intéressées à celles-ci. D’ailleurs, si vous avez un sujet sur lequel vous aimeriez apprendre ou même enseigner, soumettez-moi vos idées!Voilà pourquoi nous avons besoins de vous! Je crois qu’il est important de contribuer à un projet comme celui-ci,car il a un gros impact sur notre communauté. Le droit de savoir et le développement de compétences ne devrait pas être accessible seulement à ceux qui ont beaucoup d’argent (car oui tout le monde sait que l’art coûte cher).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>I am a small business owner and trained Accountant with over 20 years of experience and education in accounting and finance.  Prior to starting my consulting firm, the Anchor Group in 2009,  I worked as Senior Auditor at Pricewaterhousecoopers, Manager in Transaction Advisory Services Group at Ernst &amp; Young and Senior Director of Business Development at Broadridge Financial Solutions.  My first degree was in Accounting and Economics and my second degree is a  MBA in Finance and Accounting. <strong> I have included my LinkedIn Profile (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/kehowell"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/kehowell</a>)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Motivation to Write this Book</h3>
<p>I have had the privilege to train over 1,000 business owners in New York City over the past seven years in several areas of business management.  I observed that many of the business owners and entrepreneurs that attended my sessions were at first very apprehensive and fearful about the topic of financial management.   I also observed that by the middle of my sessions, I received more questions and participation and by the end of the sessions, I saw sparks of hope and excitement about accounting and financial management.   </p>
<p>These sparks of hope and excitement have motivated me to assist more businesses to grow.  However, I realized that I could not provide face-to-face training to most of the small and mid-sized business owners and in some cases, it was cost prohibitive for some business owners to have one-to-one sessions with me.  I figured that I could help more business owners if I replicated my voice, style and my excitement about financial management in a book.  I was very careful not to create another textbook, rather to provide a user friendly and easily followed guide using my years of experience working with large, medium and small businesses and now from running my own company.  </p>

The Author
I am a small business owner and trained Accountant with over 20 years of experience and education in accounting and finance.  Prior to starting my consulting firm, the Anchor Group in 2009,  I worked as Senior Auditor at Pricewaterhousecoopers, Manager in Transaction Advisory Services Group at Ernst & Young and Senior Director of Business Development at Broadridge Financial Solutions.  My first degree was in Accounting and Economics and my second degree is a  MBA in Finance and Accounting.  I have included my LinkedIn Profile (https://www.linkedin.com/in/kehowell)
 
Motivation to Write this Book
I have had the privilege to train over 1,000 business owners in New York City over the past seven years in several areas of business management.  I observed that many of the business owners and entrepreneurs that attended my sessions were at first very apprehensive and fearful about the topic of financial management.   I also observed that by the middle of my sessions, I received more questions and participation and by the end of the sessions, I saw sparks of hope and excitement about accounting and financial management.   
These sparks of hope and excitement have motivated me to assist more businesses to grow.  However, I realized that I could not provide face-to-face training to most of the small and mid-sized business owners and in some cases, it was cost prohibitive for some business owners to have one-to-one sessions with me.  I figured that I could help more business owners if I replicated my voice, style and my excitement about financial management in a book.  I was very careful not to create another textbook, rather to provide a user friendly and easily followed guide using my years of experience working with large, medium and small businesses and now from running my own company.  
All You Can Eat (AYCE), is a comprehensive financial guide that should be leveraged to strengthen your understanding of business financial management (See link to excerpt from first chapter https://www.slideshare.net/lead-campaigns/new?f...).  
All You Can Eat answers 10 of the most frequently asked questions by small businesses and entrepreneurs about business financial management.  This book should change how entrepreneurs and business managers measure and monitor the financial health of their businesses.   
Earlier this year, I was contracted as one of two NYC Instructor through Interise to facilitate the Small Business Administration Emerging  Leader Program.  During the national offsite training for the Instructors,  I mentioned to one of the instructors that I have been working on a manual for a while to assist SMEs with creating better financial culture throughout their organizations.  I was put on blast and I committed to finishing this book this year, my first book.  I am glad that I have lived up to this commitment, I have completed the book and now I am so excited about sharing it with the world of business managers, entrepreneurs, students and the curious.  I truly believe that this book will help millions of businesses to grow.
Purpose for this Campaign
I need your help.  I need you to collaborate with me in this pre-sale of ""All You Can Eat"" and help me  raise $35,000 to complete the editing of the manual and publishing and  promotion of the final book. I decided to self publish the book through the economic development and small business network that I have engaged with when I founded Anchor in 2009.   I am committed to this project and the change it will bring to the small business community.
What We Need & What You Get

With your help, I am hoping to raise $35,000 over the next 35 days.  The $35,000 will be used to finalize book edits and publishing and to manage the promotions from February to the end of the summer of  2017.   I  expect to host the first book signing at the end of February 2017,   Below, I have included a break-down of the budget for your review and edification.

I have come up with a number of cool perks for contributors to this campaign.  The lowest contribution level is $5 bucks and is called Stir It Up. 

 
I am committed to completing this project by February.  

Why Should You Contribute To Campaign
This book answers the top 10 financial management questions of entrepreneurs and small businesses in 10 chapters.  

What is financial management and why do I have to worry about it?
How do I set up my business financial management system?
How do I use financial management to grow my business?
What is the best way to manage my business cash flow?
Where can I find cash to grow my business?
The banks and investors are asking for financial projections, where do I start?
How do I protect my business against lawsuits, contingencies and disasters?
What steps do I have to take to build my personal and business credit?
What do I need to know about business taxes?
How much is my business worth?

Small Business Administration research shows that 34 percent of businesses do not make it to two years. One of the top 10 reasons why many businesses fail is due to lack of proper financial management.  


Small businesses need this help.  I have consulted with a lot of business owners and many do not know where to start when it comes on to financial management, this book will greatly help.

Good financial management increases the possibility of business success.  The Association of Certified Chartered Accountants (ACCA) states that “Financial management is at the heart of running a successful business. It affects every aspect, from managing cash flow and tracking business performance to developing plans that ensure that business owners can make the most of opportunities”.   


Content is accurate and organized systematically.  All You Can Eat is better than random googling or online searches as it brings all the fundamental and essential financial management information that a business needs to think about or better yet needs to know in one place.

One of its kind manual.  There is no book that is readily available on the market that has fused the theory of accounting and finance with the experiences and nuances of running a business and provided quickly digestible checklists after every chapter for reader friendliness.  

I show in this book that comprehensive financial management is more than timely recording and reporting of transactions in financial statement.  It is about building a culture of measurement that involves planning; forecasting and budgeting; accounting for non-financial business dealings; and resolving and adjusting for any deviations in all functional areas of a business (operations, marketing, sales, technology, strategy, finance). 
Risks & Challenges

The first draft of the complete manuscript has been completed.  I have identified copy editor, publishing coordinator and illustrator to complete the book the final version of the book.  Any delay from our February deadline, would only be due to unforeseen circumstances that might arise associate with pre-publishing steps.  All You Can Eat will be on the market by no later than the first quarter of 2017 with your assistance. 
Other Ways You Can Help

I know you might not be able to contribute financially at this time or might not have an need for this book personally.  However, passing the word on about the book and the campaign is also a great help.

Pre-purchase a copy for your friend or a business owner you might know that could use some financial management guidance

<p>Yuduyu is out to change the way the world finds jobs. To help the 40% of employers who can’t find the talent they need. To unlock the undiscovered potential of the billion people across the globe. How will we do that?  By focusing on their qualities, aptitudes, values and passions. By empowering people and communities to discover and exploit their talents to find the careers they deserve. And it will always be free for jobseekers.</p>
<p><strong>Yuduyu is inclusive:</strong> we care about jobseekers’ potential – potential they may not realize they have. That’s how we’ll bring the young, the inexperienced and the marginalised into the global jobs market.</p>
<p><strong>Yuduyu is effective: </strong>we’ll encourage jobseekers to learn more about themselves and then promote their natural talents – through gamified tests, online coaching, selfie videos. They’ll each get their own e-portfolio – a dynamic infographic showing who they are, and who they can become. And our unique career journey maps will them clarity about where they are now, where they want to be, and how to get there.</p>
<p><strong>Yuduyu is good for business:</strong> employers see a recruitment crisis – in sectors from tech to construction, healthcare to finance they can’t find the talent they need, so they take what they can find. The result: positions go unfilled, or teams are made up of what they can get.</p>
<p>We’ll help them discover an ocean of talent, building diverse and dynamic teams. Their ‘talent shortage’ will disappear. And countless studies have shown that teams work better where there’s a mix of life experiences and perspectives.</p>

Candidates start with a series of stimulating, gamified assessment tests to help them understand their natural aptitudes and character.
The results generate a personalised Yuduyu e-portfolio, a dynamic infographic of potential.
We then help them create Yuduyu career journey maps - giving them clarity about where they are now, where they want to be, and how to get there.
Yuduyu will also teach job seekers how to create great selfie videos to effectively showcase their unique style to employers.
Yuduyu e-coaching will teach them how to embrace their strengths and even their weaknesses - keeping them motivated but focused.

 

At Yuduyu, we’ve freed employers from the narrow focus on hard skills. They can now search and browse for soft skills too, things like:

personality types

<p>We are working on a project called “Ger Library” which is dedicated to the children who live in the ger district.</p>
<p>About 70% of the Ulaanbaatar city’s people live in a ger district. Therefore 90-95% of the children who live in a ger district go to schools that located in the ger district.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494310243/vnfcgugzppcim3wrvico.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In every corner of the ger district, there is no library except only for the local school’s library. Each school tends to have 1500-2000 students, its library’s capacity is 16-20 students with 16-25m2.  <strong>This is not sufficient enough standard.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494310270/amfligbgu6fxekywgiwj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>In Ulaanbaatar, there are only 5 or 6 public libraries for children. If secondary school children who live in ger district want to read books in a public library, they have to travel for 10 to 12km and spend lot of time. Public libraries are located in the downtown of the city.</p>

</div><p><strong>Children who live in the ger district don’t have enough time for studying and reading.</strong></p><ul>
<li>Because of the long distance between their home and school​, they get tired, cold, and hungry.</li>
<li>They cannot concentrate on studying at their ger homes</li>
<li>They don’t have room to study in</li>
</ul><p><strong>Children are having difficulties with their school library</strong></p><ul>
<li>Most public secondary and high school libraries have limited space</li>
<li>Book fund is insufficient</li>
<li>Inadequate desks and chairs</li>
<li>Book fund is not insufficient</li>
<li>Long distance between children’ home and school and to might happen any problems</li>
<li>They have to spend money, time and effort to travel to public libraries which are located in downtown</li>
</ul><p><u><strong>As a result from setting up a new ger library in the ger district</strong></u></p><ul>
<li>In ger district, there will be a number of libraries</li>
<li>Children who live in the ger district will have more opportunities to study and to read.</li>
<li>Children will have options to select the nearest library to their home</li>
<li>It will encourage them to study and expand their knowledge</li>
<li>They will spend their time properly</li>
<li>They will become patient</li>
<li>Gaining knowledge and studying, children will develop themselves and have higher self-confidence.</li>
<li>Academic performance will improve</li>

I graduated from university in 2015, majoring in International Business Management. When I was a student we were required to take a “volunteer learning” class in order to get familiar and help with poor level people. At that time I was involved in “Mongolia-Korea Center” which is dedicated to children who are unable to attend the normal classes and who missed school years. It took me one semester effort which made me really think about these kids and why they are living in a completely different than me and how can I help them. Therefore I have found my team members of the Ger Library project and we will work together. Through the project I am sure we could save at least a few children’s lives.</p><p> </p><p><strong>To give is more blessed than to receive.

We are working on a project called “Ger Library” which is dedicated to the children who live in the ger district.
About 70% of the Ulaanbaatar city’s people live in a ger district. Therefore 90-95% of the children who live in a ger district go to schools that located in the ger district.

In every corner of the ger district, there is no library except only for the local school’s library. Each school tends to have 1500-2000 students, its library’s capacity is 16-20 students with 16-25m2.  This is not sufficient enough standard.


In Ulaanbaatar, there are only 5 or 6 public libraries for children. If secondary school children who live in ger district want to read books in a public library, they have to travel for 10 to 12km and spend lot of time. Public libraries are located in the downtown of the city.


Children who live in the ger district don’t have enough time for studying and reading.
Because of the long distance between their home and school​, they get tired, cold, and hungry.
They cannot concentrate on studying at their ger homes
They don’t have room to study in
Children are having difficulties with their school library
Most public secondary and high school libraries have limited space
Book fund is insufficient
Inadequate desks and chairs
Book fund is not insufficient
Long distance between children’ home and school and to might happen any problems
They have to spend money, time and effort to travel to public libraries which are located in downtown
As a result from setting up a new ger library in the ger district
In ger district, there will be a number of libraries
Children who live in the ger district will have more opportunities to study and to read.
Children will have options to select the nearest library to their home
It will encourage them to study and expand their knowledge
They will spend their time properly
They will become patient
Gaining knowledge and studying, children will develop themselves and have higher self-confidence.
Academic performance will improve
              Therefore, in the ger district areas, libraries are much needed.This project aims to increase the education quality and to encourage children who cannot spend time in a library to study, because of poor and insufficient facilities to study.“The Ger Library” project implementation will be held in Ulaanbaatar city among its 6 districts.We have a 2 step plan. 1st step: First three district, one library for each district, 2017
We will launch first library October, 2017
Second library November, 2017
Third library December, 2017
2nd step:  Next three libraries in 2018.Locations of the libraries in Ulaanbaatar city's 6 districts.We are aiming to launch our first library in October 2017.Expecting results: During 3 years implementation of “Ger Library” project that enhance children’s education
Ulaanbaatar city’s ger district will have library
Students will have plenty of option to choose the nearest library with their home
The city’s children library will increase by six
We can serve for 60480 children in one year.
Children who live in poor district will have more opportunity to study and read books.

In 2017, we are planning to implement 3 library projects which means we will be able to serve 30240 children in following year.We budgeted $ 25,000 The following items will be included.

I graduated from university in 2015, majoring in International Business Management. When I was a student we were required to take a “volunteer learning” class in order to get familiar and help with poor level people. At that time I was involved in “Mongolia-Korea Center” which is dedicated to children who are unable to attend the normal classes and who missed school years. It took me one semester effort which made me really think about these kids and why they are living in a completely different than me and how can I help them. Therefore I have found my team members of the Ger Library project and we will work together. Through the project I am sure we could save at least a few children’s lives. To give is more blessed than to receive. Please support our project that encourages children’s education.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Гэр номын сан - Хүүхдийн боловсролыг дэмжих төсөлУлаанбаатар хотын гэр хороололын бүсэд шинэ гэр номын сан байгуулах төсөл маань нийгмийн болон гэр бүлийн олон асуудлаас болж  хотын төв руу номын санд суух боломжгүй байдаг. Гэр хороололын 100 мянга орчим сурагчдын амжилттай сурч боловсроход тулгамдаж буй асуудлыг багасгах нэг хэлбэр буюу бидний шийдэл юм. Улс орны хөгжлийн удаашралт, ядуурлаас шалтгаалж сурч боловсрох эрх нь бусдаас илүү ихээр зөрчигдсөөр байгаа гэр хороололын сурагчдын сурах хүсэл эрмэлзлийг нэмэгдүүлэх, боловсролын чанарыг дээшлүүлэхэд бидний зорилго оршино.Гэр хорооллолын 100 мянга орчим хүүхдэд зориулсан анхны номын сан байгуулах төслийг дэмжээрэй. Сайн байна уу? Намайг Болорхундага гэдэг.Бид Улаанбаатар хотын гэр хороололын бүсэд  хүүхдэд зориулсан гэр номын сан байгуулахаар зорьж байна.УБ хотын нийт хүн амын 70 орчим хувь  гэр хороололд амьдардаг. Гэр хороололд амьдардаг хүүхдүүдийн 90-95 хувь нь гэр хороололынхоо сургуульд суралцдаг.Гэр хороололын аль ч бүсэд тухайн гэр хороололд байгаа сургуулийн өөрийн дотоод номын сангаас өөр ямар ч нэмэлт номын сан байдаггүй. Сургуулийн номын сан нь 16-25 м.кв талбайтай 16-20 хүүхдийн багтаамжтай байдаг. 1500-2000 сурагчтай  гэр хороололын сургуулиудын сурагчдын хувьд энэ үнэхээр хангалтгүй байна.УБ хотын хэмжээнд 5-6 ширхэг хүүхдийн нийтийн номын сан байдаг нь  аль ч гэр хороололын хүүхэд очиж суухад нэг талдаа 10-12 км замыг автобусаар 2-3 удаа дамжин очдог. Нийтийн номын сангууд хотын төвд байрладаг.Гэр хороололд амьдардаг хүүхдүүд гэртээ гэрийн даалгавар хийх, ном унших боломжгүй байдаг.
Холоос хичээлдээ явдаг учраас даарч, өлсөж, ядардаг
Гэртээ олуулаа амьдардаг тул гэртээ хичээл хийхэд анхаарал төвлөрдөггүй
Хичээл хийх өөрийн гэсэн өрөө байхгүй
Сурагч өөрийн сургуулийн номын санд ном унших, сууж хичээл хийхэд гардаг бэрхшээл
Сургуулийн номын сангийн жижиг танхим дүүрэн байдаг
Номын хүрэлцээ хангалттгүй
Ширээ, сандал хүрэлцээгүй
Номын фонд сонирхолгүй, ядуу 
Холоос хичээлдээ явдаг учраас даарч, өлсөж, ядардаг
Асран хамгаалагчид нь байнга дууддаг яааруулдаг
Сургууль гэр нь зайтай учир замд ямар нэгэн аюул эрсдэлтэй учирч болзошгүй
Нийтийн номын санруу явахад автобусны мөнгө шаардлагатай
ТЭГВЭЛ-Гэр хороололд Гэр номын сан байгуулбал гарах үр дүн
Хүүхдийн номын сангийн тоо нэмэгдэнэ
Гэр хороололын сурагчид илүү ном унших, хичээл хийх боломж нэмэгдэнэ
Сурагч аль ойр номын сандаа суух сонголттой
Хүүхдийн ухаан тэлж, мэдлэгтэй болно
Чөлөөт цагаа зөв, үр дүнтэй өнгөрөөнө
Тэвчээртэй зөв сууж сурна
Номын санд сууж сурсанаар өөртөө илүү итгэлтэй болно
Сурлагын чанар сайжирна
Иймд Гэр хороололд  номын сангийн хэрэгцээ шаардлага зайлшгүй хэрэгтэй байна.Нийгмийн болон гэр бүлийн асуудлаас шалтгаалж номын санд суух боломжгүй гэр хороололын сурагчдын сурах хүсэл эрмэлзлийг нэмэгдүүлэх, боловсролын чанарыг дээшлүүлэх зорилгоор гэр номын санг байгуулах болно.Энэхүү хүүхдийн боловсролыг дэмжих “ Гэр номын сан ” төслийн хэрэгжилт УБ хотын  6 дүүрэг тус бүрт нэг, нэгийг байгуулахаар төлөвлөж байна.

My mom is single, working multiple part-time jobs, and caring for my sister and me.  I am hoping to help our family by finding the support to make this trip and to get a real camera (I only have an iPhone right now).  I will need about $1800 for living expenses and about $700 for a good digital camera.  That's where I came up with $2500.  Your contribution of any size will help me reach my dreams of experiencing a world very different from the streets of Mumbai and even the Pacific Northwest, and of one day working in the creative side of Internet technology.  If it feels right to help, I will be so grateful!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are positive that <b>we can obtain access to many game developers who will have lots to say and teach</b>. However it is possible that some developers turn us down for any number of reasons. Here are some solutions to those risks:</p>
<ul> <li> We have created a <b><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanGameDev/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reddit community</a></b> to keep you updated of what is going on while we are in Japan, as well as keeping our <b>twitter accounts</b> updated with the <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23japanGamedev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#JapanGameDev</a> hashtag. <b>You will always know what's going on!</b>
</li> <li>In those cases where we can not contact a specific developer, we will always make it up by interviewing a person as in their team if possible, or adding developers close to their team, style, and philosophy. <b>Our communities are there so that you can help decide who we approach next!</b>

News



Voting for developers and IPs is live. Make your voice heard!


Referral system is live. Get your free perks!

Secret perk added: Get your favorite game signed by its creator!
Added FREE Online Casts of Bitsummit, Comiket and Tokyo Game Show to all perks!

We have now interviewed some of our most important developers!-Hironobu Sakaguchi-Koji Igarashi-Goichi Suda-Takumi Naramura





The Problem

We are Giacomo and Luis, and our passion is game design. Over the last few years we have had the chance to meet many icons of game development like Hideo Kojima, Fumito Ueda, Hironobu Sakaguchi, and many others.



Yet we have noticed that our candid conversations with them about game creation are never reflected in mainstream media. 



Giacomo with Hideyuki Seino [Jukebeat], Yoji Shinkawa, Donna Burke, Hideo Kojima [Metal Gear Solid], and Koji Igarashi [Castlevania].


Our Solution




As game designers ourselves, chatting with these masters of game development was an incredible learning experience  to improve our craft, and we believe more people should have access to that knowledge. Likewise, we believe these masters of game design deserve to have an outlet to talk games, without business pressures. 



The only way for them to talk openly about game design is to not be part of the mainstream media, but independent.




Luis with Akihiro Hino [Ni no Kuni], Hironobu Sakaguchi [Final Fantasy] , Toshihiro Nagoshi [Yakuza], and Goichi Suda [Lollipop Chainsaw Massacre] .

We will be traveling Japan for 10 weeks and meeting with creators of amazing Japanese games, interviewing them about how they made their games from a game development standpoint, what it took in terms of personal and professional effort, and what their advice for new game developers is. 


We will also ask them your questions! We have rewards that allow you to create and vote for questions to be asked to specific developers, so make sure to check those perks out!





Developers

The process of selecting and contacting developers is very time consuming, and between the community and ourselves we have to be able to make choices on the fly; however we have a working list you can access to view the names we are working with and the progress on interviewing them!

Some of the awesome game developers we are looking to interview!



Access the full list of developers here (50+) 
This is a live document and it changes constantly with the community's input.

Why It Is Important


We will be conducting these interviews out of our passion for game design, and with your help we can do so much more than by ourselves. 

With your support we will be able to access more developers, travel to where they are, set up more interviews, and increase production quality. 


With your support we can create the first compendium of interviews from classic Japanese game developers fully focused on their game design philosophies - ever.




Funding


We are starting with our personal savings, but those are somewhat limited. With your support, we can expand the project to many more developers!Costs are mainly divided among the following percentages and categories:







Travel: Includes travel within Japan, i.e. Tokyo to Kyoto, Osaka...
Lodging: Although we will travel very inexpensively [Giacomo is a fan of capsule hotels!], lodging will definitely increase our costs when visiting developers outside Tokyo.
Technical: Cameras, video and audio editing, lights...
Misc. expenses: A safety net in case that any emergency should arise when setting up interviews, travelling, or editing.





A capsule hotel: The cheapest way to sleep in Japan!



Should we surpass our funding goal, we will invest all remaining funds in reaching out to more developers. We have calculated that is takes approximately 300$ to 450$ worth of time, travel expenses, and technical needs per developer interview. The more we can invest in this project, the more and better interviews we can make!



Should we not reach the funding goal, since this is a flexible campaign that is OK too! We will do as many interviews as we can and still fulfill our perks, mostly by cutting on interviews outside Tokyo.
We believe this project is bigger than ourselves, so we will keep making progress with it for as long as we can!







Featured Perks





Ask Your Own Questions! - 25$

Send your favorite developer your own questions! You will be granted access to our private forum where you can post questions to be asked in general or to specific developers.
Take this chance to learn specific details and techniques that you have been thinking about, or that you are fighting in your current project.
You will be credited with the question both on the video and printed releases of the interviews.
Questions will be voted by the community and selected according to votes. We do reserve the right to not ask questions which can be considered offensive.

Team





Giacomo Vaccari has worked on over a dozen games, is CEO of Lethal Games and founded the International Games Developer Association in Spain. He holds 40 game world records, and his greatest passions are arcade games, and 60s-80s music. He still believes the Sega Saturn is the ultimate arcade-at-home machine.

 Favorite games: Nights Into Dreams, FFVII, Panzer Dragoon Saga, Doom, MGS2 and Saturn Bomberman.






Luis García has worked on game localization in the UK, Spain, Germany, and for the last 8 years in Japan, where his dream of working in Final Fantasy games became true. He also runs his own indie game studio Shinyuden, has a game collection numbering the hundreds, and believes the only right way to eat paella is with a wooden spoon.

Favorite games: Ico, FFVI, Yakuza 0, MGS3, Space Invaders and Kuma Uta.






How to Help

 
The primary way of helping this project is by choosing a perk and backing it!

But hey, even if you can not back the project there are ways you can help! Maybe you are a student or are not employed at the moment. We have been there too! 

You can still support this project by sharing it with your friends in social media, or telling a friend who is passionate about game development! Every bit helps. You can follow us on twitter and share our posts holding the hashtag #JapanGameDev. Share this campaign through Indiegogo's sharing utilities! Every share counts.

Join our Reddit community!








Risks and Challenges




We are positive that we can obtain access to many game developers who will have lots to say and teach. However it is possible that some developers turn us down for any number of reasons. Here are some solutions to those risks:
  We have created a Reddit community to keep you updated of what is going on while we are in Japan, as well as keeping our twitter accounts updated with the #JapanGameDev hashtag. You will always know what's going on!
 In those cases where we can not contact a specific developer, we will always make it up by interviewing a person as in their team if possible, or adding developers close to their team, style, and philosophy. Our communities are there so that you can help decide who we approach next!

Ya hemos entrevistado algunos de nuestros desarrolladores mas importantes:-Hironobu Sakaguchi-Koji Igarashi-Goichi Suda-Takumi Naramura




El Problema

Somos Giacomo y Luis, y nuestra pasión es el diseño de juegos. En los últimos años hemos tenido la oportunidad de conocer a muchos iconos de la industria de los juegos como Hideo Kojima, Fumito Ueda, Hironobu Sakaguchi, y muchos otros.



Sin embargo notamos que nuestras conversaciones con ellos sobre creación de juegos nunca aparecen en los medios mainstream. 



Giacomo con Hideyuki Seino [Jukebeat], Yoji Shinkawa, Donna Burke, Hideo Kojima [Metal Gear Solid], y Koji Igarashi [Castlevania].


La Solución




Siendo nosotros mismos desarrolladores de juegos, hablar con estos maestros del desarrollo de juegos ha sido una experiencia de aprendizaje increíble para mejorar nuestros conocimientos, y creemos que más gente debe tener acceso a sus conocimientos. Así mismo, creemos que estos maestros del diseño de juegos se merecen tener un lugar para hablar sobre juegos, sin presiones comerciales. 



La única manera de que hablen abiertamente sobre diseño de juegos es no siendo parte de los medios mainstream, sino independientes.




Luis con Akihiro Hino [Ni no Kuni], Hironobu Sakaguchi [Final Fantasy] , Toshihiro Nagoshi [Yakuza], y Goichi Suda [Lollipop Chainsaw Massacre] .

Recorreremos Japón durante 10 semanas para reunirnos con estos creadores y entrevistarlos sobre cómo crean sus juegos, qué decisiones vitales y profesionales han tenido que tomar, y qué recomiendan a los que empiezan su carrera.


¡Además les haremos tus preguntas! Tenemos recompensas que te permiten crear y votar preguntas para que se las preguntemos a los desarrolladores, así que ¡asegúrate de echarles un vistazo!





Desarrolladores

El proceso de seleccionar y contactar a los desarrolladores lleva mucho tiempo, y entre la comunidad y el equipo tenemos que poder tomar decisiones rápidas; sin embargo tenemos una lista que puedes acceder para ver los nombres con los que estamos trabajando y cómo de cerca estamos de entrevistarlos.

Algunos de los desarrolladores a los que estamos contactando.



Accede a la lista de desarrolladores (50+) 
Este documento está ""vivo"" y cambia continuamente con la ayuda de la comunidad.

Por Qué es Importante


Vamos a realizar estas entrevistas por nuestra pasión al diseño de juegos, y con tu apoyo podemos hacer mucho más que nosotros solos.

Con tu apoyo seremos capaces de acceder a más desarrolladores, viajar a donde están, y producir mejores entrevistas.


Con tu apoyo podemos crear la primera biblioteca de entrevistas enfocadas a diseño de juegos por parte de diseñadores de juegos clásicos japoneses en Castellano de la historia.




Fondos


Empezamos el proyecto con nuestros ahorros personales, pero son limitados. ¡Con tu ayuda podemos expandir el proyecto para incluir mucho mas desarrolladores!Los costes para este proyecto se dividen mayormente en los siguientes porcentajes y categorías:




Viaje: Incluye viajes dentro de Japón, tales como de Tokio a Osaka, Kioto, etc...
Estancias: Aunque viajaremos ""a lo barato"" [a Giacomo le encantan los ""hoteles cápsula""], las estancias son una buena parte de los gastos fueran de Tokio.
Gastos técnicos: Cámaras, edición de video y audio, luces...
Otros gastos: Una red de seguridad por si surgen problemas durante las entrevistas, viajes, o edición.





Un ""hotel cápsula"": ¡La forma más barata de dormir en Japón!



Si sobrepasamos nuestro objetivo de fondos, invertiremos todo lo recaudado en conseguir más entrevistas. Hemos calculado que por cada entrevista los gastos son aproximadamente de unos 270€ a 370€ entre viajes, tiempo, y necesidades técnicas. Mientras más podamos invertir en el proyecto, más y mejores entrevistas podremos hacer.



Si no llegamos al objetivo de fondos, como esta campaña es ""flexible"", podremos continuar aunque con menos recursos. Haremos todas las entrevistas posibles y entregaremos todas las recompensas, mayormente eliminando viajes fuera de Tokio.
Creemos que este proyecto es de gran importancia, así que seguiremos haciendo entrevistas mientras tengamos fondos.






Recompensa Destacada





¡Haz tus propias preguntas! - 22€

¡Envía tus preguntas a tu desarrollador favorito! Tendrás acceso a nuestro foro privado donde podrás crear preguntas generales, o dirigidas a desarrolladores en concreto. Una gran oportunidad para aprender detalles o técnicas de los maestros y que te puedan ayudar en tu carrera.

Las preguntas se someterán a votación por parte de la comunidad y seleccionadas por mayoría. Nos reservamos el derecho de no hacer preguntas que creamos pueden ofender a los creadores.

When we think back just a few years to a time when no school would consider bringing us into their building, it is amazing how many schools are now contacting us to ask if we will work with them. Unfortunately, most do not have budgets to cover our expenses and repeatedly we are forced to say, “No.” We have to turn down 70-75% of the requests we receive. Your support will change that. 
How We Will Use the Money | For every $2,000 we raise, we can start a new partnership with a local school or community organization. Please help us reach five more schools next year! The money we raise here will be spent on materials, payment for teaching artists, and bus tickets for youth participants. The LGBTQA+ youth community is counting on you. Every donation, no matter what size, helps.
The Impact | In the two years since starting our sQool program, Dreams of Hope has grown from engaging dozens of young people and reaching hundreds, to engaging hundreds and reaching thousands. But our funding has not kept up with our growth. We have shown beyond any doubt, there is great need for what we do. Your support will:

Bring LGBTQA+ history, theory, and arts practice into classroom across the Pittsburgh region
Create out-of-school-time partnerships that engage LGBTQA+ youth in arts programming
Train educators to better support the LGBTQA+ students they work with

Your support can make it possible for more LGBTQA+ youth to feel at home at their own schools. 
Other Ways You Can Help | We also understand many people can't donate now, but that doesn't mean you can't help! We need your support in spreading the word about this campaign and the music video. Please share, tweet, and spread the word! #ImHomeWhen the community supports LGBTQA+ youth. Tell us when you feel at home! With your help, maybe folks like Laverne Cox and George Takei might even hear about us and support our work!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<li>Better social and emotional IQ</li>
<li>Even better jobs</li>

<h3><strong>Building a Community of Young Readers</strong></h3>
<p>When my son was 8 he was one of those kids who was always buried in an HP book. (that's Harry Potter for those of you not in the know.) But when he finished that series, he was stuck on what to read next.  I kept offering suggestions and was shocked to see how little my 3rd grader cared about my recommendations. Here’s where things got interesting. When a fellow 3rd grader suggested the same book I did, suddenly my kid couldn't wait to go to the library to get that book. What!? Oh yeah, kids care what friends think more than dear ol' Mom.</p>
<p>This inspired me to create an online community for young readers where kids’ choices and kids’ voices are center stage. In Bookopolis, students can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share book reviews with kids their age</li>
<li>Recommend books to friends</li>
<li>Explore curated book lists by grade level and genre</li>
<li>Track their reading through digital bookshelves and reading logs</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Impact for Students and Teachers </strong></h3>
<p>Since its launch, our platform has proven its basic mission, to get kids reading more. Teachers and librarians have adopted our platform as both a replacement for boring old paper logs and a way to build a community of engaged readers in their classroom.  We get messages every day from teachers, parents and students like:</p>
<p><i>“This website helps me find books I actually want to read. I love it!”</i>  (4<sup>th</sup> grade student)</p>
<p><i>""Bookopolis gives my 4th graders the opportunity to become 21st century learners in a safe and monitored way. They have opportunities that stretch beyond the text of the book by reading other students' book reviews.”</i> (4<sup>th</sup> grade teacher)</p>
<p><i>""I love to see the excitement of my students when they check the website to see what peers suggest as great reads."" </i>(5<sup>th</sup> grade teacher)</p>
<p><i> “Bookopolis has turned my kid into a total reader who loves books. Thank you!”</i> (6<sup>th</sup> grade parent)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Our Growth</strong></h3>
<p>With the help of grassroots marketing efforts and a few fancy awards, we have over 13,000 teachers, librarians and parents using our platform with over 200,000 kid readers adding thousands of reviews every week.  We were selected as “<strong>Best Teaching and Learning Website”</strong> by the American Association of School Librarians, a <strong>“Top 100 Educational Websites</strong>” by Homeschool.com and earned a <strong>“Cool Ed Tech Tools”</strong> award from EdTech Digest.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help Get Kids Reading with Bookopolis</strong></h3>
<p>Educators have embraced this free tool as a way to help build a community of engaged readers and writers in the classroom.  Working closely with teachers and librarians from all different types of schools – urban, rural, big, small, well funded, wildly underfunded, and everything in between – has given me a new appreciation of these superheroes. They must simultaneously be a motivational speaker, calm disciplinarian, expert in fractions, nurse, sympathetic shoulder, confidante, role model, planner, and tech guru.</p>
<p>Many educators spend hundreds of dollars of their own money to fill their classroom with basic supplies, new books, and a few tech tools.  <strong>We want to keep Bookopolis as a free resource that helps educators honor kid voice and choice as they inspire students to love reading.</strong></p>
<p>The good news is the cost for a classroom to use Bookopolis for the year is just $25.  Help fund a classroom (or two or three) this year and get all kids reading more and loving it.  </p>

<p>We are serious about Education and we are serious about Fun.  Our mission in the educational arena has always been to continuously foster children’s learning and to make teaching the most positive experience it can be. </p>
<p>Our games are for everyone and by “everyone” we mean even the most struggling students who get easily distracted or disengaged while learning - by balancing gameplay enjoyment with a challenge, our games are very motivating and, with this, are a powerful tool for addressing learning gaps making participants to pay attention and at the same time make bigger efforts to succeed. </p>
<p>A constant desire to unlock new ways of making complex or unfamiliar math material accessible, compelling and igniting curiosity in a classroom setting sparked the creation of the first math games back in 2008, hand-made using wood, home printing and hand painting. </p>
<p>Since then our games have been played by and helping many students to learn math and their increased popularity and recognition for effectiveness resulted in holding the first Math Olympics (""Olimpiadas de las Matematicas"") at the Pacific University in Colombia (“Universidad del Pacifico”) with over 300 students from different schools participating.</p>
<p>This year, our top two games have been polished in their design, functionality, and thematic execution as well as adopted new names, “Math Train” and “Math Knights”.  We built our own plastic injection molding tooling, we improved graphic package design, we developed a business plan that includes commercialization, which will allow us to be able to sustain our social effort and our growth.  Finally, we “wrapped” the whole concept and business as Ingithink.</p>
<p>And today, we feel ready to take our project to the next level and by formalizing it expand our reach to the public so our games are played by more children, students, adults and they become board games to bring the entire family together. </p>
<p>Considering the objectives above, what we need is some help from You to make our games available on the market by launching a full-scale production. </p>
<p>To ensure that we create an educational future where EVERY child is engaged and excited about learning “one game at a time” we have incorporated charitable giving into our business model and costing structure: by buying one of our games You are automatically creating an equal valuable opportunity to share benefits among your family members and/or friends, schools or organizations of your choice i.e. “Every sold Game Equals One Game as a Gift”.</p>
<p>In the long term we are hoping to become a networking educational platform (Ignithink) where Teachers, Mentors, Parents and critical thinkers alike can engage in the interactive discussions, dialogs and/or debates about hot educational topics, issues, participation/community service learning etc. sharing their educational ideas and insights, teaching tools and methods, games and validate them through voting and ranking by contributors and share same ideas, tools and games via uploads.</p>

<p>This original game is a single- and multiplayer (up to six participants) game that can be player both at home and/or in a classroom. Like in a fun dominoes game, one needs to link 67 tokens while practicing negative numbers additions and working with mathematical signs and absolute numbers. The winner is the first player to run out of tokens.</p>

<p>What can be better than building math through play!  The best part of Math Knights board game is that participants will engage in learning math without realizing it while experiencing a great adventure – enter into a realm of the two kingdom’s battle and help your King to advance and conquer the opponent’s kingdom by building math concepts (through addition and multiplication of negative and positive numbers).  In order to win one must find a solution while the sand timer runs out.  The game involves rolling dice and using tokens to challenge the opponent (Wizard casting the spell) and counter-attack (Math Knights faithfully serving his King). This game is for two players, play Math Knights in PVP mode or challenge mode, you choose.   </p>

<p>When we think about the impact one can create by participating in our campaign we inevitable associate this subject with an inspiring story about an anthropologist studying the habits and customs of an African tribe.  The man suggested a game where children had to run towards the basket with fruits.  The first to arrive was to be awarded with the whole basket without obligation to share with anyone else.  The anthropologist was stunned to notice that upon signaling “Now” the children grabbed each others hands and ran to the basket together all at the same time arriving and enjoying the prize all together as well.  When asked why they did it the children responded “Ubantu” or “I am what I am because of who we all are.” </p>
<p> By contributing no matter how big or small to our campaign, whether simply by spreading the word or investing you are presented an opportunity not only to recognize the benefits of games and game-based learning but also to support academic achievement of children around the globe and broaden access to educational opportunities for those who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>Sharing a passion for education, advancement, accomplishment and a vision of expanding outreach to underserved communities and children in need together we can do so much more:</p>
<p>- This starts from allowing us to make our dream come true</p>
<p>- Funds received will kick start the mass production; with this, more games to play, more children are engaged  - together we promote Math Literacy and Creativity</p>
<p>- The more we give, the more we get - more new ideas, new games, new projects like Ingithink platform and alike…</p>
<p>- By participating in the program You are also sponsoring games for anybody on the globe, pick from any school and/or organization on the map and we will give away an exact same game you purchased</p>
<p>- Last but not least, you will receive a great product at a very competitive and attractive price that can be enjoyed by the entire family.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>Based on a business plan we built in order to launch a successful mass production of our two games, Math Train and Math Knights, we need $34,331 USD.</p>
<p>Our budgeting includes the following:</p>
<p><strong>Legal:</strong></p>
<p>- Graphic designs rights and registrations (9%)</p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong></p>
<p>-Dominoes Injection molding tooling balance payoff (18%)</p>
<p><strong>Marketing &amp; Commercial:</strong></p>
<p>- Webpage (4%)</p>
<p>- Products bar codes (1%)</p>
<p>- Marketing fees (8%)</p>
<p><strong>Production:</strong></p>
<p>- First mass production and final assembly ((60%) the number is based on projected expectations of this campaign and the volume that will justify the target retail price and the absorption of the tooling, designs, fixed costs and logistics)  </p>
<p>* If our goal is not achieved, we will conduct a further assessment to determine what we can accomplish with the funds received and produce as much games as we can at a prototype-level cost.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ignithink is at a prototype to production stage. We have a very good product with the content and design already being validated. Our challenges have to do with resources availability and timelines as we are coordinating designs and supply from different parts of the world. Even though we have firm commitments and schedules, changes may occur, however, we will keep you informed at all stages as our production goes on and/or if the product availability is delayed, and we will take immediate actions to minimize impact to our plan in order to meet your expectations.</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>With a diploma in Child and Youth Work and a Bachelor's degree in Child and Youth Care, child development is a huge interest of mine. Throughout my career so far, I have had the opportunity to work with parents, caregivers, children and youth in various capacities, and supporting families has become a passion of mine. Although I grew up in Northumberland, I have spent the last decade studying and working in Toronto. Last year I became a mom for the first time, and recently relocated with my growing family to make our home in Port Hope.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479742514/vrmgskd4sihybn2yazjw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why This Project Matters</h3>
<p>Right away I fell in love with this community. I soon noticed how many young families live in this area who are seeking ways to connect with other families and engage with their little ones, yet there are so few quality programs available, like the ones that I enjoyed in the city. As a new mom myself, I understand how challenging early parenthood can be. Social isolation is a major hurdle that new parents, especially moms, face. The good news is that having access to relevant parenting knowledge, together with establishing a sense of connection to others in similar life stages, can be a huge asset to the well-being of both caregivers and children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recent research in the area of early child development has heightened awareness about the critical importance of children’s earliest experiences. It is becoming more widely understood that the prenatal period until about age 3 is a critical time when children are most profoundly influenced through interactions with their primary caregivers, underscoring the need for programs that empower families with knowledge and skills that could help them flourish.</p>

<p>Somos una familia con un sueño en movimiento, conformada por dos adultos enamorados, dos frutos de niños, una perra y un gato, que desde el año 2012 tiene como misión de vida  promover el libro y la lectura con los 5 sentidos, transformando realidades <strong>en comunidades rurales y de riesgo social, refugios y casas de abrigo, escuelas, centros de atención al adulto mayor, instituciones para personas con diversidad funcional, parques y hospitales en Venezuela y otras latitudes</strong>,</p>
<p>Por este esfuerzo sostenido tuvimos la oportunidad de recibir el galardón del Premio Nacional Del Libro de Venezuela 2014, en la categoría: experiencia en promoción del libro y la lectura.    </p>
<p>Casa Kuentonáutica es una pequeña biblioteca infantil y juvenil de tipo familiar, que se encuentra al servicio de toda la comunidad de Bella Vista, en las profundidades de las montañas andinas, en Venezuela. Una zona rural, habitada por familias de bajos recursos económicos, cuya principal actividad productiva es la agricultura.</p>
<p>El tema que nos conecta como familia con esta comunidad, de la cual somos parte desde hace 5 años, es el poder mantener viva su memoria, vista no solo como un almacén de los recuerdos, sino también como ventana del porvenir. Es por eso que nos planteamos el diseño de una colección de libros interactivos animados, a partir de la recreación de los dibujos hechos por los niños, acerca de las fiestas populares de mayor tradición en la localidad. Para esta ocasión iniciamos la aventura con la fiesta de San Isidro Labrador, patrón de los agricultores.

</div></div>","Somos una familia con un sueño en movimiento, conformada por dos adultos enamorados, dos frutos de niños, una perra y un gato, que desde el año 2012 tiene como misión de vida  promover el libro y la lectura con los 5 sentidos, transformando realidades en comunidades rurales y de riesgo social, refugios y casas de abrigo, escuelas, centros de atención al adulto mayor, instituciones para personas con diversidad funcional, parques y hospitales en Venezuela y otras latitudes,
Por este esfuerzo sostenido tuvimos la oportunidad de recibir el galardón del Premio Nacional Del Libro de Venezuela 2014, en la categoría: experiencia en promoción del libro y la lectura.    
Casa Kuentonáutica es una pequeña biblioteca infantil y juvenil de tipo familiar, que se encuentra al servicio de toda la comunidad de Bella Vista, en las profundidades de las montañas andinas, en Venezuela. Una zona rural, habitada por familias de bajos recursos económicos, cuya principal actividad productiva es la agricultura.
El tema que nos conecta como familia con esta comunidad, de la cual somos parte desde hace 5 años, es el poder mantener viva su memoria, vista no solo como un almacén de los recuerdos, sino también como ventana del porvenir. Es por eso que nos planteamos el diseño de una colección de libros interactivos animados, a partir de la recreación de los dibujos hechos por los niños, acerca de las fiestas populares de mayor tradición en la localidad. Para esta ocasión iniciamos la aventura con la fiesta de San Isidro Labrador, patrón de los agricultores. Celebración de agradecimiento a los buenos tiempos otorgados por la tierra para la siembra y la cosecha de los alimentos.
Esta historia de más de 100 años de edad, será contada por los niños y niñas de la aldea Bella Vista, luego de varias entrevistas con los abuelos de la comunidad, así como desde su experiencia de colaboradores en los preparativos de la fiesta, donde tendrán la oportunidad de dibujar los rostros, ocupaciones, altares, personajes tradicionales y actividades relevantes de los protagonistas y líderes de la celebración.

<p><strong>Coded by Kids, a free technology education program, reaches nearly 100 students a week in schools and rec centers across the city of Philadelphia. Currently in its third year, CBK has scaled up quickly to bring a robust coding curriculum to kids ages 5-18.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are ready to do more. We have a waiting list of 12 schools community groups that are excited to partner with us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With your help we can raise the funds to support 12 after school coding programs across Philadelphia, allowing us to to reach 300 students every week. </strong></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Teach</h3>
<p>Our dynamic, project-based curriculum teaches students skills used by adult software engineers and web developers every day on the job. The longer a student stays in one of our programs, the more skills they acquire, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning to advanced web application development</li>
<li>Beginning to advanced user interface and user experience design</li>
<li>Fundamentals of IT project management</li>
<li>Fundamentals of software engineering</li>
<li>Fundamentals of tech focused entrepreneurship</li>
</ul>
<p>Students as young as 5 years old have created websites about their favorite movies and cartoon characters,  know how to code in multiple languages, and use Git/Github for version control and project tracking. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our vision and plan</h3>
<p>Coded by Kids envisions a world where technology education is as accessible as youth sports.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 when CEO, Sylvester Mobley, volunteered at his neighborhood rec center teaching coding to just one student, the program has grown on a shoestring budget with the help of a dedicated group of volunteers and program partners.</p>
<p>We are strong believers in partnership and its power to help a program like ours quickly and effectively get its services to kids in their own communities.   The funds we raise from this campaign will be used to bring free, high quality after school coding programs directly to the students our partners serve.</p>

<h2>Campaign FAQ</h2>
<p><u>1. <i>Why are we crowdfunding?</i></u></p>
<p>Coded by Kids is in demand. <strong>We've been able to achieve a lot with a little, but we believe crowdfunding is the best way to raise the money we need funds needed to make an impact now. </strong>We’re not looking for easy money — we want to make sure Philadelphia students can keep up, and ultimately, lead the way</p>
<p><u>2. <i>What is our program budget? </i></u></p>

<p><u>4. <i>What happens if we don't raise the full amount of funding?</i></u></p>
<p>Our programs will be run in the order that partners signed on to participate in our campaign.

With the Willow College system, you can be in a full time career and fit the lessons in anywhere. You can be waiting at the Doctor's surgery, one lesson done, taking a coffee break, that’s another. Queuing up to pay for your groceries, another lesson.

Together we have built an online community with interiordezine.com where hundreds of thousands of people from around the world have gained new skills and the confidence to take their learning to another level through the ecourses we provided. We have been a positive influence in peoples lives and their future, and we have done it all for free for the last 15 years.So Why Change a Good Thing?Technology has changed, and we can now offer a far better way of learning and helping even more people with a mobile learning management system. We have called this Willow College. Short 3-minute bite sized interactive lessons, able to be undertaken, anywhere, anytime. Users can login and see their progress on a dashboard, talk in a community, compete against their friends, generally learn in a fun and interactive environment.Why Pay Now?Technology costs money, to provide this system we need to charge you, its as simple as that. Problems with Change - Why it Holds us BackPeople often procrastinate with further learning because they don’t think that they can fit it into their already busy lifestyles and are too afraid to fail if they try because they are too busy to make the class or do the homework and assignments. With the Willow College system, you can be in a full time career and fit the lessons in anywhere. You can be waiting at the Doctor's surgery, one lesson done, taking a coffee break, that’s another. Queuing up to pay for your groceries, another lesson. It’s as simple as that – we can help you learn interior design without having to change your current lifestyle, but it will make an enormous change to your future. You biggest fear is overcome, you will not fail because we will guide you all the way.Who Has Spare Time?It just means when you would normally use 3 minutes to check your Facebook or Instagram account, you are now learning something with Willow College instead.  The course is undertaken at your own pace, there is no time pressure, some weeks you have too many commitments and others you have more downtime. That’s the great thing about this, there is no one chasing you to hand in an assignment. You are in complete control.  So Why are We Crowd Funding?It's pretty simple, we have put everything we have into this project, time and money, but we don't quite have enough to get it finished. We have a family to support and a little bit more software to buy, and a couple more helping hands would be great. How Can You Help?Because we have so many fantastic students who have already completed our 3 free courses, we thought they could help us get the word out about what we are doing and in return we could offer them great Foundation Member pricing for the subscription. Anyone that supports us with this funding campaign will keep the same ""Perk"" subscription rates for life. These Perks - (look right),  are all listed there.Lee has written an ebook about Interior Designer Insights - you will receive this entertaining and insightful ebook as well as a Subscription to WillowCollege.com.

If you help us here by purchasing a ""perk"" you will receive that life changing Interior Design learning experience.
