<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>“Just as the ocean may be turbulent above, but is always still in its depths, so beneath the surface noise of our thoughts there is always available a deep reserve of calm and tranquillity.” Bodhipaksa</i></p>
<p>I'm Bodhipaksa, and I've been teaching meditation since the late 1980s. Since 2001 I've been running an online meditation center (<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481516228/utlibbydedge3pxtj95i.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:right;margin:0 0 15px 15px;width:400px;height:560px;""/><a href=""http://www.wildmind.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wildmind.org</a>) which offers free guidance on meditation. I've also published a bunch of books, audiobooks, and guided meditation albums.</p>
<p>I do this because nothing makes me happier than seeing other people become happier.</p>
<p>These four meditations, born from over 30 years of practice and exploration, offer highly effective techniques for slowing down the mind, creating calmness, and bringing into being a more authentic, calm, and positive approach to living. We plan to publish them as ""<strong>Guided Meditations for Inner Peace</strong>.""</p>
<p>Research shows that on average we’re caught up in distracted thinking 48 percent of the time, and often much more than that. Research also shows that our distracted thinking causes unhappiness. These distractions are often driven by anxiety, irritability, and self-doubt, which undermine our well-being and lead to stress and depression.</p>
<p>Mindful attention, on the other hand, brings freedom from the tyranny of compulsive thinking and allows us to have a deeper, richer, and more joyful experience of life.</p>
<p>What we're asking is simply that you purchase the album (plus or minus some enhancements!) in advance. You can also make a donation, if you wish.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $2,500 to cover the costs of editing four guided meditations I've already recorded (in the wonderful Mill Pond Music Studio, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire), for designing the cover art, and for publishing the CD.</p>
<p>Our perks include the CD or MP3 version of <strong>Guided Meditations for Inner Peace</strong>, plus enhanced versions of the meditations in different lengths (so that you can choose the one that fits the amount of time you want to meditate), as well as other benefits.</p>
<p>The four tracks are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>The “Eyemax” Experience</strong>: Simply changing the way we pay attention visually can create a cascade effect resulting in deep calm and relaxation.</li>
<li>
<strong>Just Listening</strong>: An awareness of sound, and of the space around us, creates a ""perceptual stretch"" that quiets the mind.</li>
<li>
<strong>Resting in the Present Moment</strong>: Our distracted thoughts are almost always about the past and future. Embrace the reality of the present moment (which is the <i>only</i> reality) and much of our thinking simply drops away.</li>
<li>
<strong>“Mind Full”-ness of Breathing</strong>: Mindfulness of the breathing is the key method for calming the mind. But often it fails because we pay attention to too few of the sensations of the breathing. Letting the mind become filled with the breathing leaves insufficient mental bandwidth for rumination to take place.</li>
</ol>
<p>The total running time is around 72 minutes.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, nothing changes. The funds will simply underwrite the costs of production. Publication of the CD may just take a bit longer! </p>
<p>For those of you who think, ""Why CDs? Why not just MP3s?"" the answer is that a surprising number of people still like to buy CDs, and we make more of our income from CDs than from digital downloads.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help relieve us of some of the financial stress of bringing out ""Guided Meditations for Inner Peace."" </p>
<p>This project will give you tools that you can employ anytime in your life to help you calm down your mind and feel more at peace. You'll also be supporting a small independent publisher, and helping us to bring the benefits of meditation to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Wildmind has already published nine albums of guided meditations, which have been very popular. One of our CDs was Amazon's best-selling meditation title for three straight years.</p>
<p>Bodhipaksa's guided meditations are highly regarded. He has a simple, direct, down-to-earth, and step-by-step approach to teaching. His teachings are delivered with gentleness, warmth, and humor.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's really no risk to this project. Although we've had to go into the red in order to do so, we've already recorded the material, and are working with our designer on the cover art. We're ready to go as soon as we have the funding to continue. (That bit's up to you!)</p>
<p>If we raise more than we're asking for, this will go toward covering our running costs and help us to bring the benefits of meditation to the world.</p>

</div><p><b>The following are </b><strong>excerpts from my story:</strong></p><p><u>The Corporation</u></p><p>The Owner built the Corporation and it was good. He diversified the business and gave power over it also to His Son, The Boss. Codes of conduct and ethics for conducting business were set forth. There were buildings, resources, tools and equipment. The Owner and the Boss had work for everyone, benefits and a retirement package. All the employees were given contracts and became the workforce of The Corporation. The Corporation was operated by the authority of Head Office.</p><p>Reports came from The Corporation that a manager was trying to take business in a new direction. The Boss went undercover as a regular employee to check up on the new business practices and manager's influence on the Corporation and workforce. The Owner had established proper Rules and Conduct for the Corporation to follow to do business in the right way. The Boss found that under the manager's misdirection, business was a mess, employees were misbehaving and The Corporation's business had become unethical and dirty.</p><p>The Boss stepped forward doing the work of The Owner by His rules; a few recognized The Boss' Authority, the Truth of His Words, and His flawless work. The manager terminated the undercover Boss under false allegations; many employees followed the manager's rules, some that they might also share in the power structure created by the manager and others for fear of that power structure. The Boss' Word came back, after He was terminated, that those who kept to the rules of the Owner would keep their retirement packages, but those that followed the manager would ultimately be fired.</p><p>...Okay, this parable continues on for another twenty six sentences, but you need to buy the whole story to get there. This parable is a contrived allusion/metaphor of God, Jesus, Satan and living here on earth. (Corporation=body) The sentence structure is built upon the meaning of numbers in the Bible. The first sentence is 1, the fifth sentence is 5, the tenth sentence is 10, etc. (six is <i>man</i>, ten is<i> the Law</i>, twelve is <i>divine government</i>, seventeen is <i>victory</i>, and thirty is <i>dedication to authority</i>)  When you receive my story, <u><i>Jason Bornagain: The Fess Up File</i></u>, you get the whole forty sentence parable and the meaning of each number. This story is not so much a work of bleeding out my life, in as much as it is a critical understanding that a major key to understanding the Bible is in it's numbers and the meaning of those numbers.<br/><br/><strong><u>The F.E.S.S.U.P.

No, and it wasn't the Christian but the enemy, Satan, that puts those words in some one's mouth. The real enemy is the influential force behind wicked words. We all struggle the same struggle. There are many different denominations and buildings and gatherings and they all claim divine patience, understanding and compassion... They all have their own rules. Lots the same, lots different. Agent Bornagain visits many different denominations. Good news is Jesus is everywhere. Bad news, so is the devil.Chapter 5The Holy Spirit effect and the inner workings of being a Bornagain agent of Jesus Division.Chapter 6The basic needs of Man and the Canadian Greenhouse Effect.Chapter 7So, the campaign is over and I was able to raise $???????. Here's whats happening now....(even I don't know how it is going to end, but I will soon and I'll tell you all about it.) You only have until November 27 to buy your copy!I look forward to sharing with you, dear reader, the amazing changes my soul has experienced with Jesus and the wonderful insights God has blessed me with,These are the last words in the Bible and the truest I wish to bless you with:May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.Love, Jason Claude Kerra.k.a. Jason BornagainP.S. Revelations 13 tells us that the Mark of the Beast will prevent any God fearing soul from buying and selling stuff. So how's a good Christian gonna eat when you can't buy food? The answer is the Canadian Greenhouse. What? You think you got time to build one later? And why don't churches already have one to feed the poor? Give a fish, eat for a day. Teach to fish, eat for a lifetime...until he can't buy a fishing license because the Mark of the Beast. Build a greenhouse and feed a community (Canadian Greenhouse all year round) and register that greenhouse as part of the church, separate from state, like now!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Dear Friends and Fans of Poetry,</strong></h3>
<p>This year, Spooky Girlfriend Press will be turning nine years old. Nine! We've published 14 titles to date, everything from a debut full-length poetry collection (<i>Getting Lucky</i> by Nicole Steinberg), an e-chapbook (<i>Libido</i> by Cathy de la Cruz), to a chapbook of non-fiction essays (<i>Stone Boats</i> by Elizabeth Taddonio). We believe that women continue to be underrepresented in the world of literature, poetry in particular, and our primary goal is to fight against this condition and attempt, in our own way, to make a dent in this situation. Given the political horror movie that we will all soon have parts in, we think this cause is more valuable than ever and we want to continue publishing poetry our way.</p>
<h3><strong>But we need your help.</strong></h3>
<p>Now a one person operation, our primary goal is to raise enough money to be able to produce two chapbooks this year, the first being <i>What Urge Will Save Us</i> by the immensely talented Alina Pleskova. (You can see some poems from her chapbook in this issue of<i> <a href=""http://www.poemmistress.com/home/alina-pleskova/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mistress</a></i>!)</p>
<h3>""Fierce like the history of poetry itself, Alina Pleskova gives us poetry that explores how relations, love, and even failed love are where the real answers await.  I would read anything she writes, a poet who gives the world back to us with her brilliant, assertive poems.  Say Thank You Alina and BUY THIS BOOK!""<br/>--CAConrad<br/> </h3>
<h3>""In Alina Pleskova's <i>What Urge Will Save Us</i> fever, competing economies of intimacies, work, and cultural expectation circulate together around a speaker who resists definition(s). Off-handed insight and candor brew an extremely subtle defiance here, allowing Pleskova to ask in subways, on sidewalks, of partners and friends all the gorgeous questions about how to resist and persist.""<br/>--Cynthia Arrieu-King<br/> </h3>
<h3><strong>“I thought it’d be more years of / men repeating my jokes louder /instead I swallowed / something electric” and I’m not exaggerating when I say Alina’s is the only poetry I read these days. <i>What Urge Will Save Us</i> is a potent little book, all summer thighs sticking to the bus seat and late-night existential crises tempered with tarot; the kind of thing you write “!!!” in the margins of and make your friends borrow like they could ever care the way you do. Forget mamochka with her zakuski and come drink up the sun tonight, it’s all-in out here, it is, excuse me, really fucking great. You’ll<br/>remember this one.""<br/>-- Sonya Vatomsky</strong></h3>
<p>We are hoping to reach a goal of $1,000, all of which will be used for Spooky Girlfriend projects. Here's some of the things we want to do with our fundraising goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Produce Alina's chapbook and a second chapbook this fall / winter.</li>
<li>Restock SG titles (and buttons!)</li>
<li>Have funds to be able to properly compensate the poets we publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more we raise, the more we can do! Some of the things we want to do include celebrating our 10th anniversary by publishing another full-length collection in 2018, as well as go to regional book festivals to get our name out there even more.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Please consider sharing our campaign via Facebook, Twitter, your blog/website, and wherever else poetry lovers in your life frequent using Indiegogo's helpful sharing tools above. We know there are a lot of good causes out there, a lot of small poetry presses who also need help to do what they love, but we sincerely hope that you'll help us making 2017 the spookiest year yet.</p>

Hello beautiful

</div></div>","Short Summary Movable is an independent art and culture magazine that started as an online blog and website. We feature artists from all over the world, covering everything from contemporary art, writing, music reviews, interviews, photography, and a bit of fashion. I design the magazine myself using Adobe InDesign with the help of a few technical editors.   What We Need & What You Get My goal is to raise $1,000 to pay for the cost of maintaining the website, promotional materials like business cards, and 100 copies of ISSUE02 printed in full color. It's really that simple. Once the money is raised copies will be accessible to the public for free!  

The Impact


Movable is one of the only independently printed art magazines coming out of the Northeast United States. I am moving across the country this month and hoping to do some marketing along the way. I will be settling in Northern California in December hoping to contintue the magazine from there. It certainly is Movable.  It is a collaborative effort and a great way to showcase up and coming as well as established artists. It's fascinating to see it come to life. This fundraising campaign is in effort to build it's momentum. The next step is to build a wide enough audience and generate advertisements to help pay for the cost of printing. 



Risks & Challenges

 The only major risk I can predict is my computer crashing or my Adobe programs like Photoshop and InDesign not working. If that occurs, I'm sure to find a way to get the magazine designed and printed if I have to borrow a computer and or buy new software. If we do not reach our goal, the money raised will still go to printing ISSUE02 and I will be fronting the rest of the money myself. In this scenario, it will take longer to get it printed, but we will find a way.

<p><strong></strong>It happens every year on Thanksgiving. Local TV and newspapers cover it. Friends post about it online and blogs promote it. Politicians and clergy, corporate executives and athletes jump in. Out of compassion, they come to help to feed the homeless and visit the poor. Clean crisp aprons, big smiles, handshakes. For one day, for one meal – and then they are gone.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/308346/pictures/full/20120630221641-D09a__SRGB.jpg?1341119867"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Just as surely as they show up in the morning, the holiday helpers vanish by dark. The next day only the deeply committed return. No turkey dished out under the glare of television lights, no scrum of reporters. Suddenly those in poverty have once again, become invisible.</p>
<p>ThanksGivingAmerica is committed to changing that.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Project</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>During the third week of November 2012, in celebration of our national day of Thanks, ThanksGivingAmerica will open an exhibit of 50 photographic and multimedia essays – one from each state – highlighting the struggles and dreams of impoverished Americans, as those with little join those with a little more to give Thanks.</p>
<p>Award-winning photographers in all 50 states will carry out the project during the late summer and fall. The result will be a powerful visual reckoning unseen since Dorothea Lange and the Dust Bowl photographers chronicled the Great Depression and created riveting images that helped mold the nation’s collective memory and conscience. We will photograph a broad array of those struggling economically showcasing how they embody the enduring American spirit. Since poverty knows no zip codes or city limits we will visit people in need in rural, urban and suburban communities, and in each of America’s states.</p>
<p>The exhibit will open at Columbia College Chicago in a beautiful street-front gallery at the corner of Congress and Wabash Streets in Chicago's Loop, and travel to schools, colleges, town halls, libraries, community centers, and houses of worship throughout the United States.</p>
<h2><strong>The Context and the Need</strong></h2>
<p>According to 2011 Census data 46.3 million Americans – nearly 1 in 6 of us – live in poverty. This is the largest increase in the fifty-two years that the government has measured poverty.</p>
<p>Twenty million Americans – more than the entire population of New York State – live on less than $11,000 a year for a family of four.</p>
<p>One in five American children lives in poverty, most in families where at least one parent has a job.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Organization</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>ThanksGivingAmerica is a project of the AmericanPoverty.org campaign (<a href=""http://americanpoverty.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://americanpoverty.org</a>), a 501(c)3 non-profit alliance of some of the most accomplished photographers in the United States. Joining us are renowned American writers, filmmakers and educators, all of whom seek to make alleviating poverty a national priority. Together we are working to dispel stereotypes and encourage actions that can create lasting impact on the lives of the disadvantaged. We believe that the stories of people struggling to overcome poverty deserve to be told - and that by sharing them we can inspire thousands and thousands of people to take action and create change.</p>
<p>Founded by Steve Liss, Columbia College Chicago teacher, Aspen Institute Ascend Fellow and thirty-year veteran <em>Time</em> Magazine photographer, AmericanPoverty.org and its parent organization, In Our Own Backyard, have mounted exhibits in galleries, town halls, libraries and schools from San Jose, CA to Washington, DC (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/channels/231864"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/channels/231864</a>.)</p>
<h2><strong>Beyond Thanksgiving</strong></h2>
<p>The result of this project will be published, exhibited and made available to those wanting to help reawaken the conversation, who want every day to be Thanksgiving, when our collective eyes – along with our hearts – are opened to those in poverty.</p>
<p>The exhibit will travel throughout the United State. Pending sponsorship, a book of photographs and essays would also be published as a permanent, tangible product that could be used as an ongoing reference and a record of the project. Moreover, the photographs and multimedia will become part of the AmericanPoverty.org Student Leadership Project (<a href=""https://vimeo.com/28254822"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/28254822</a>), which provides high school students opportunities to learn about poverty and encourage community involvement.</p>
<h2><strong>We can’t do this alone – we need your help!</strong></h2>
<p><strong></strong>IF this were easy, we wouldn’t be asking for your help. But even with photographers and editors donating their time, there are trememndous expenses: hotels, airfare and meals, the costs of making, mounting and shipping prints and the financial reality of launching a publicity campaign once the images are made.</p>
<p>And that's where you come in: your support <em>today</em> can help make this project a reality. Your support of both dollars and spirit will be present in every print, every exhibit and every step we collectively take towards making the invisible, visible.</p>
<p>The project is highly scalable, and the number and location of exhibits will dependent on the success of our Indiegogo campaign, as well as ongoing outreach to potential funders.</p>
<p>Our parent organization, In Our Own Backyard, NFP is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Accordingly <strong>all contributions to the ThanksGivingAmerica project are tax deductable under U.S. tax code.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Cool Perks</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>In addition to our boundless gratitude, we are offering some terrific rewards; a chance to own historic and beautiful photography, printed from original transparencies or files using archival pigment ink insuring they will last a lifetime and more.</p>

It happens every year on Thanksgiving. Local TV and newspapers cover it. Friends post about it online and blogs promote it. Politicians and clergy, corporate executives and athletes jump in. Out of compassion, they come to help to feed the homeless and visit the poor. Clean crisp aprons, big smiles, handshakes. For one day, for one meal – and then they are gone.

Just as surely as they show up in the morning, the holiday helpers vanish by dark. The next day only the deeply committed return. No turkey dished out under the glare of television lights, no scrum of reporters. Suddenly those in poverty have once again, become invisible.
ThanksGivingAmerica is committed to changing that.
Our Project
During the third week of November 2012, in celebration of our national day of Thanks, ThanksGivingAmerica will open an exhibit of 50 photographic and multimedia essays – one from each state – highlighting the struggles and dreams of impoverished Americans, as those with little join those with a little more to give Thanks.
Award-winning photographers in all 50 states will carry out the project during the late summer and fall. The result will be a powerful visual reckoning unseen since Dorothea Lange and the Dust Bowl photographers chronicled the Great Depression and created riveting images that helped mold the nation’s collective memory and conscience. We will photograph a broad array of those struggling economically showcasing how they embody the enduring American spirit. Since poverty knows no zip codes or city limits we will visit people in need in rural, urban and suburban communities, and in each of America’s states.
The exhibit will open at Columbia College Chicago in a beautiful street-front gallery at the corner of Congress and Wabash Streets in Chicago's Loop, and travel to schools, colleges, town halls, libraries, community centers, and houses of worship throughout the United States.
The Context and the Need
According to 2011 Census data 46.3 million Americans – nearly 1 in 6 of us – live in poverty. This is the largest increase in the fifty-two years that the government has measured poverty.
Twenty million Americans – more than the entire population of New York State – live on less than $11,000 a year for a family of four.
One in five American children lives in poverty, most in families where at least one parent has a job.
Our Organization
ThanksGivingAmerica is a project of the AmericanPoverty.org campaign (http://americanpoverty.org), a 501(c)3 non-profit alliance of some of the most accomplished photographers in the United States. Joining us are renowned American writers, filmmakers and educators, all of whom seek to make alleviating poverty a national priority. Together we are working to dispel stereotypes and encourage actions that can create lasting impact on the lives of the disadvantaged. We believe that the stories of people struggling to overcome poverty deserve to be told - and that by sharing them we can inspire thousands and thousands of people to take action and create change.
Founded by Steve Liss, Columbia College Chicago teacher, Aspen Institute Ascend Fellow and thirty-year veteran Time Magazine photographer, AmericanPoverty.org and its parent organization, In Our Own Backyard, have mounted exhibits in galleries, town halls, libraries and schools from San Jose, CA to Washington, DC (https://vimeo.com/channels/231864.)
Beyond Thanksgiving
The result of this project will be published, exhibited and made available to those wanting to help reawaken the conversation, who want every day to be Thanksgiving, when our collective eyes – along with our hearts – are opened to those in poverty.
The exhibit will travel throughout the United State. Pending sponsorship, a book of photographs and essays would also be published as a permanent, tangible product that could be used as an ongoing reference and a record of the project. Moreover, the photographs and multimedia will become part of the AmericanPoverty.org Student Leadership Project (https://vimeo.com/28254822), which provides high school students opportunities to learn about poverty and encourage community involvement.
We can’t do this alone – we need your help!
IF this were easy, we wouldn’t be asking for your help. But even with photographers and editors donating their time, there are trememndous expenses: hotels, airfare and meals, the costs of making, mounting and shipping prints and the financial reality of launching a publicity campaign once the images are made.
And that's where you come in: your support today can help make this project a reality. Your support of both dollars and spirit will be present in every print, every exhibit and every step we collectively take towards making the invisible, visible.
The project is highly scalable, and the number and location of exhibits will dependent on the success of our Indiegogo campaign, as well as ongoing outreach to potential funders.
Our parent organization, In Our Own Backyard, NFP is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Accordingly all contributions to the ThanksGivingAmerica project are tax deductable under U.S. tax code.
Cool Perks
 In addition to our boundless gratitude, we are offering some terrific rewards; a chance to own historic and beautiful photography, printed from original transparencies or files using archival pigment ink insuring they will last a lifetime and more.

A memoir about a little girl’s journey from a Shanghai brothel to Beijing society. 


My Memoir:

The remarkable story of an illiterate sing-song girl who ascends from poverty into the upper levels of Beijing society.  This book reminisces about my guardian Nainai, a beautiful woman who is neither my mother nor grandmother, but rather my grandfather’s concubine.

About the Author:

Growing up in Beijing during China's Cultural Revolution, after two children and comfortably settled in New York, I feel compelled to explore my roots in a memoir spanning more than eight decades of the last century, from the closing days of the Manchu Dynasty, through Mao's reign, to the China's modern era.

The Last Concubine:Qian RuoHua (NAINAI; 1924‐1986) is a pretty girl from Suzhou whose destitute parents sell her into the decadent world of Shanghai brothels at the age of 7. Her apprenticeship begins every morning when she cleans the mess made by the big girls the previous night. In the afternoons she studies music, poetry, calligraphy and chess, all the lessons needed to acquire the rudimentary qualities of a faux scholar. This potent combination of sexual charm and intellectual foreplay is an essential aspect of brothel culture.  The Shanghai sing-song girls are Page Six trend setters, even holding their own beauty pageant. Already a sought after virgin‐in‐waiting when she reaches puberty, Nainai's first night is auctioned off to the highest bidder.  Her prize money sets a record, much to the delight of her greedy madam. After a few more years of plying her trade, Nainai is sold once more to a Beijing playboy, Yeye, my grandfather.  Nainai is still only 16, while Yeye is 36 and living with his parents, his second wife, Popo - my grandmother, his three other concubines and four children, one of whom is my mother. After joining my family, Nainai soon relegates the head concubine, Little Willow, to the doghouse.  Much to the dismay of Popo and the other concubines, the glamorous new arrival seizes control of the household.

POPO (1901‐1980) is a haute monde heiress, a direct descendant of the Manchu rulers.  Her family’s dynasty is vast: banks, railways, mines, textile and cement factories and water works. At one point, the mining operation employed Herbert Hoover, future president of the United States, as its chief engineer. To accommodate her half-bound feet, Popo wears custom-made shoes that make her look ridiculous.  A stench of cigarettes repels, and her zigzagged yellow-tinted finger and nails scares me.  As warm and engaging as Nainai is, Popo is every bit as impersonal and cold. Upon meeting Nainai, Popo actually takes a liking to her because of the notion that the teenager has exacted revenge for her on Little Willow. But her satisfaction is short‐lived, as she finds herself sitting at the foot of her husband’s opium bed, watching in anguish as Yeye and the young Nainai smoke and frolic on silken sheets. Because of the ignominy inflicted by Nainai, Popo moves out of the family compound.  When Yeye falls on hard times, she continues to provide financial support to the household. She never stops loving Yeye.  On her deathbed she still thinks about his upcoming 80th birthday, even though she has never been invited to any of his parties over the years.  Popo dies alone in the hospital. Craving the love and attention she never received at home, my MOM (1934‐1968) heeds the call of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, becoming a firm proponent of the cause. To the bewilderment of everyone, Mom runs away and joins the army in 1950, where a down‐to‐earth love and admiration from her platoon comrades fills the void.  She transforms herself into a star of the new movement, and is an enthusiastic participant in all of Mao’s radical initiatives. Although hailed as the poster girl for the Party, she is ultimately betrayed by a jealous faction and winds up incarcerated where, completely forlorn and abandoned, she breaks down and commits suicide. Just before she hangs herself, she methodically writes two wills: the one to Chairman Mao is left on the desk. The other, a secret will, she hides in a pillow, hoping that my Dad will find it. The suicide instantly shatters my privileged and serene childhood. To make matters worse, the second will inadvertently sentences me to a virtual Gulag for five long years. Nothing will impact me as much as the suicide.  I bounce around among family members, where I suffer abuses and instability at the hands of uncaring aunts and an indifferent Dad. 

Aside from my three guardians, there are stories from the Beijing household.  Poor Little Willow falls from grace when she is unable to conceive children for her master.  Then there are the servants who provide the foundation for the household: butler, chauffeur, chef, tailor, wet nurse, nanny and personal maid ‐ stories that are many and entertaining. This memoir is told during my days spent in the bathhouse with Nainai.  When I finally reunite with her after a decade, I find that everything has changed, and any hopes to rekindle the former are gone. YEYE (1903‐1984) sums up his life, “I have no regrets” is his final conclusion.

<p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>See, there's this retreat I'm planning on attending in October called <a href=""http://www.gayromlit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GayRomLit</a> near Chicago.  This will be my second year attending this fantastic event, and this year is special because I will be attending as a supporting author (under the pen name <a href=""http://www.gayromlit.com/author/nicole-forcine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nicole Forcine</a>). It feels as if I have finally 'arrived'.  I have a pen name, and some fans, and people looking forward to meeting me.  Being a supporting author gives me a chance to really get out there with my peers and make connections that will really help me in this newly chosen lifepath.</p>
<p>I paid for my admission with my own money, My partner got me the plane ticket as a birthday prezzie...and now I had to worry about a hotel and eating/cab fare/etc.</p>
<p>Last year, I was employed, but since then I've been struggling with the hydra that is depression, anxiety and newly-diagnosed fibromyalgia and writing from home has become my 'job'. So far, I have one full length novel published, a few short freebies, one entry in an anthology, and one novella officially on the way early next year. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">I was planning on paying for that with an advance from my second full length novel, but I am still working on it. So that advance will not be in my hot little hands in time, so...yeah.  I'm going to need help or a lot of money is going down the drain.</span></p>

<li>I'm sharing a room with someone, so my half of the hotel (<a href=""http://indianlakesresort.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indian Lakes Resort</a>) is about $300.</li> <li>From what I understand, Chicago is a pretty pricey city, and for some reason the hotel is bloody far away from O'Hare airport to Bloomingdale, with fare averaging about $50 both ways (approx. $100).</li>
<li>...and of course, once I get there, I'll need to eat.  I have actually no idea how much meals are going to cost since the place is smack dab in the middle of the a golf course, so I might end up having to nosh at the hotel's restaurants (approx. $200-300).</li>

<br/><ul>Welcome to the RESIN RIVER Indiegogo campaign!<br/> <br/>        I am Sarah E. Cote, an artist from Orono, Maine. <br/>Growing up in Maine was, as any childhood is in a small university town, boring. Or so I thought. It was too small for me, the big fish. It was too plain, too conservative, too quiet. I knew everyone in high school because we had gone to kindergarten together. It was the quintessential, anywhere New England childhood. Old creaking cold wood floors, wool socks, my mom's coffee cake on the weekend, the sound of light rock easing out of the radio while my dad read the newspaper. It was jeans and sweatshirts, hockey games, town festivals...It was safe.<br/><br/>Then, suddenly it wasn't. <br/><br/>        Suddenly my family had a secret that I now know many families hold close to their chests. I grew up never talking about this secret, the event that changed my family's entire world. Suddenly it was us against everyone and everything. The trauma that utterly quaked our family apart would be the same one that has proved to be the biggest learning curve of my existence to date. <br/>        <br/>        I began writing RESIN RIVER, first as a journaling exercise to suss out a lot of pent up emotion and aggression that frankly, I never saw myself sharing with a therapist let alone the general public. It quickly took shape, becoming a timeline of the past and present and an imagined future- all the while these difficult things were continuing to pile up and just relentlessly hound me. I soon realized, this could be an outlet to say everything I never said but wanted to say, it could be an outlet to stick up for my family and be there for them in a way I never could in real life. I was fifteen when these vague difficulties I am eluding to started up, and I carried a guilt with me for years. One seeded in being useless, ineffective, in the way emotionally and physically. <br/>        In the process of writing and just living a life full of varied experiences, I came to believe that I am telling a global, relatable story that has the potential to provide reassurance in a sense. That people in similar situations (I know, so vague) can read the story and hear their own fears, excitements, traumas and joys reflected in the words and maybe not feel so isolated, like I did. And that is just one part of the book. The family story intertwines with our protagonist, Myra's story. She finds herself living in an abandoned hunting cabin in the Maine wilderness. There, she survives with a small group of dear friends. These stories weave in and out until they connect and yeild something entirely out of this world. <br/><br/><br/>       Contributors will help give me time. I am at the fifth editing process, I've even gathered a select group of people to read and give notes/edits. It has a lot of editing left to go, but it is a finished manuscript. Beginning, middle and end. It needs polishing, it needs smoothing out, just like any work of art in eternal process, does. Contributors will essentially let me finish my book and get it to the point where I can reach out to literary agents. I can't say that I have ever shared such a raw and personal piece of art. It's terrifying reaching for a dream! It is! But it is also exciting and powerful, and by contributing you'll be doing just that- helping me grab a dream. You'll be helping me tell a story that I have been telling myself for ten years. Only this time, you'll be giving me a pedestal to do so.<br/><br/>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Break it Down Now...</h3>
<p>        To make this project work, I need your help. To finish my edits, to be able to send out queries by July 1st I am asking for $4,000.</p>
<p>The expenses:</p>
<p>1.) Rent. I need $1,200 for March, April, May and June's rent.</p>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>         By finishing RESIN RIVER, getting it to a place where I am ready to reach out to literary agents and small presses, you, the contributor, will have played a major role in launching a life work into the world. A piece of work that I am personally passionate about, also a story that has the potential to touch so many people. Like so many families, so many individuals, the event that shook us was one of sexual violence. <br/>        It's taken years to speak about this event, especially since it was not mine to speak about. Instead I kept quiet because I felt like if it was not my trauma, I had no right to feel so traumatized about it. But there were ripples through us all, of varying speeds and sizes. We each dealt and are still dealing with the repercussions to this day. <br/>        With the recent blessing of my family member who's life experiences I do encorporate into the story, getting it finished will be of paramount meaning to the both of us and to our family. I don't claim to know her true experiences as, I would never claim to know anyone's, but I hope in some way I am giving her a voice, and giving others a voice. I certainly have claimed my voice in the process of writing RESIN RIVER.<br/> <br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I will complete my goal. That sounds presumptuous, but it's been a long journey into getting RESIN RIVER to where it is and I don't see the point in ever giving up on getting it published. But to be clear, this campaign is to let me finish editing it. Your perks do not rely on it being published. I would be so honored to have the support in the home stretch.   <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you are like me, and have a minimal amount of financial resources, you can still make a huge impact on this project by contributing with mere pocket change. I mean that is the amazing thing about crowd sourcing, a small amount goes a long way. If you cannot contribute monitarily, you can help by sharing the campaign with your friends and family members. You can make noise for me and RESIN RIVER and the issues it explores. Be my champions! Post it on facebook, on your blogs, tweet the link, shout it out! <br/><br/>There are also tools for sharing on Indiegogo for your ease. <br/><ul></ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Welcome to the RESIN RIVER Indiegogo campaign!         I am Sarah E. Cote, an artist from Orono, Maine. Growing up in Maine was, as any childhood is in a small university town, boring. Or so I thought. It was too small for me, the big fish. It was too plain, too conservative, too quiet. I knew everyone in high school because we had gone to kindergarten together. It was the quintessential, anywhere New England childhood. Old creaking cold wood floors, wool socks, my mom's coffee cake on the weekend, the sound of light rock easing out of the radio while my dad read the newspaper. It was jeans and sweatshirts, hockey games, town festivals...It was safe.Then, suddenly it wasn't.         Suddenly my family had a secret that I now know many families hold close to their chests. I grew up never talking about this secret, the event that changed my family's entire world. Suddenly it was us against everyone and everything. The trauma that utterly quaked our family apart would be the same one that has proved to be the biggest learning curve of my existence to date.                 I began writing RESIN RIVER, first as a journaling exercise to suss out a lot of pent up emotion and aggression that frankly, I never saw myself sharing with a therapist let alone the general public. It quickly took shape, becoming a timeline of the past and present and an imagined future- all the while these difficult things were continuing to pile up and just relentlessly hound me. I soon realized, this could be an outlet to say everything I never said but wanted to say, it could be an outlet to stick up for my family and be there for them in a way I never could in real life. I was fifteen when these vague difficulties I am eluding to started up, and I carried a guilt with me for years. One seeded in being useless, ineffective, in the way emotionally and physically.         In the process of writing and just living a life full of varied experiences, I came to believe that I am telling a global, relatable story that has the potential to provide reassurance in a sense. That people in similar situations (I know, so vague) can read the story and hear their own fears, excitements, traumas and joys reflected in the words and maybe not feel so isolated, like I did. And that is just one part of the book. The family story intertwines with our protagonist, Myra's story. She finds herself living in an abandoned hunting cabin in the Maine wilderness. There, she survives with a small group of dear friends. These stories weave in and out until they connect and yeild something entirely out of this world.        Contributors will help give me time. I am at the fifth editing process, I've even gathered a select group of people to read and give notes/edits. It has a lot of editing left to go, but it is a finished manuscript. Beginning, middle and end. It needs polishing, it needs smoothing out, just like any work of art in eternal process, does. Contributors will essentially let me finish my book and get it to the point where I can reach out to literary agents. I can't say that I have ever shared such a raw and personal piece of art. It's terrifying reaching for a dream! It is! But it is also exciting and powerful, and by contributing you'll be doing just that- helping me grab a dream. You'll be helping me tell a story that I have been telling myself for ten years. Only this time, you'll be giving me a pedestal to do so.

  Break it Down Now...
        To make this project work, I need your help. To finish my edits, to be able to send out queries by July 1st I am asking for $4,000.
The expenses:
1.) Rent. I need $1,200 for March, April, May and June's rent.
To not be out of housing, but to pursue this goal, I need to afford the place I live. 
2.) Living Expenses, minimal salary and saying thank you.
Not only will I be treating the next four months as if writing is my job, I need money to pay my living expenses ie; gas, insurance, groceries, water, electric, internet. In total $2,800 which breaks down to $700 per month or $175 per week. 
A portion of this money is also going to provide you with real live perks, it will cover printing and shipping, maybe to get to your very own door!

<h4>As April of 2010 came to a close, Jolene
Lavine wondered why her family’s typically packed schedule was suddenly empty. Her question was answered on April 29, when tragedy struck.</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>While preparing for a weekly horseback riding lesson, her ten-year-old daughter, Jessica, was kicked in the head by a horse. That day Jolene’s family began traveling a road they’d never imagined possible.</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<i>Guide Her Home: A Year of Hope After a Child’s Tragedy </i>follows the family through the first year of Jessica’s injury. From the accident itself to all that followed, readers share the intimate experience of a family’s fight for a child’s life and a mother’s search for the light that will help guide her daughter home again.</h4>

<p>Our goal is to self-publish this book in the summer of 2014. </p>
<p>Because our first campaign was not fully funded, we took the opportunity
to reevaluate both the costs for this project, as well as our personal budget to determine where we could save money along the way.  Both avenues brought savings to light, but at the end of the day not quite enough, so here we are.</p>
<p>Having received positive feedback regarding the incentives involved
in the prior campaign, we have kept many of them in place, with just a bit of tweaking. Once again, we hope the incentives will help make the support of this book more enticing.</p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will help to issue the final
payments to the editor, the graphic designer, the interior book designer, the printing of the books, as well as the processing and shipping fees. </p>
<p>This has been a truly humbling experience. Jolene is very excited and, honestly, scared to see this book go out into the world. We thank you all who are eager to read it and feel it is a story that must be told. </p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and any help you can lend to
making this dream a reality. </p>
<p>As always, peace and love, and Gratitude Rising for any
support you can give to Guide Her Home.</p><p></p>

Guide Her Home: A Year of Hope After a Child’s Tragedy follows the family through the first year of Jessica’s injury. From the accident itself to all that followed, readers share the intimate experience of a family’s fight for a child’s life and a mother’s search for the light that will help guide her daughter home again.


Part One of this campaign, including weekly updates on the
project’s progress can be found here.

Our goal is to self-publish this book in the summer of 2014. 
Because our first campaign was not fully funded, we took the opportunity
to reevaluate both the costs for this project, as well as our personal budget to determine where we could save money along the way.  Both avenues brought savings to light, but at the end of the day not quite enough, so here we are.
Having received positive feedback regarding the incentives involved
in the prior campaign, we have kept many of them in place, with just a bit of tweaking. Once again, we hope the incentives will help make the support of this book more enticing.
The funds raised in this campaign will help to issue the final
payments to the editor, the graphic designer, the interior book designer, the printing of the books, as well as the processing and shipping fees. 
This has been a truly humbling experience. Jolene is very excited and, honestly, scared to see this book go out into the world. We thank you all who are eager to read it and feel it is a story that must be told. 
Thank you for your consideration and any help you can lend to
making this dream a reality. 
As always, peace and love, and Gratitude Rising for any
support you can give to Guide Her Home.

Hello, my name is Rhonda Fazio, Environmental Alchemist. I am a graduate
of art history and textile design from the University of Massachusetts
Dartmouth. I maintain
an educational studio and gallery at the Narrows Center  in Fall
River, Massachusetts, where I teach and facilitate natural dye and historical

The Campaign
For
this campaign I will be doing a series of photo essays and primary source
documentation that will form the foundation for my research tour of Color
Across America: Southern Rim. This is the first installment to what is going to
be an ongoing series of campaigns. Upon their completion, there will be a published, catalogued collection of information and stories about the use of natural dyes and pigments
in American history. This also includes people in an historical context as well
as in the present. 

(Primary Materials: blue red and yellow color sources)

I love
telling stories about the dye sources I use in my studio. People who visit me
are so surprised by how far these resources date back into human history. It is
important for me as an artist to connect with my materials as well as my people,
not just in and around my studio and community but all around America.


For reasons of diversity
This campaign will enable me to reach out in a broader extent - personally and literally to research, educate and instruct on the importance of preserving the history and resources of natural color. There are people, plants and pigments everywhere but yet, they hardly know each other. This is my specialization of task: To bring it all together and make it concise, doable, responsible use of, and simplify enough of the knowledge to sustain the methods for coming generations. All of this will be done without further compromising our environment.  






The long road aheadThis is
the beginning of my research tour. I need funds to reach my destinations: particular cities along the east coast (research libraries and historical societies) into the southern rim of
America straight on through to the deserts of southern California (field work) and then back
again. follow my blog to see where I will be going(Fill 'er up!)

and Alaska may take me longer to reach, so I will have to publish those
separately when the time comes. 




Perks of being a benefactor
The perks in helping me achieve success with this campaign are the beautiful natural dyed textiles and pigments I make in my studio.  The real bonus is that all of my perks come gift wrapped just in time for the Holidays! Please visit my website to see the examples of the perks.

I have received grants for community projects from local cultural councils where I live. The grant process is long, limited and competitive.

My Resiliency

Since I believe in people and hope that they believe in me, I thought I would try the crowd-funding platform.
I decided to break the trip up in increments instead of doing one entire sweep of the nation. It makes it more affordable and reasonable not to mention realistic. 


  Challenges For me, the risk is giving up on your hopes and dreams--and that is never an option for me. I will see this through. 
I raised a son entirely on my own, an unanticipated turn of events that turned out to be a blessing for my family. I went back to school and earned two degrees in the arts: a BFA in Textile Design and a BA in Art History. Not very lucrative fields, but I found my passion and persevered.

<h2><strong>Campagna RDC 2018/2019</strong></h2>
<p>Ciao a tutti classicisti. Dato il successo della campagna dell’anno scorso siamo tornati con una nuova edizione dell’unico diario dedicato interamente agli studenti del classico. <br/>Siamo sempre i soliti 4 ragazzi con lo stesso obiettivo: creare un diario scolastico per alleggerire le ore infinite di greco, latino e compagnia bella. <br/>Questa campagna di raccolta fondi rappresenta la realizzazione di un nostro sogno e il vedere ripagate tutte le ore che abbiamo dedicato a questo progetto. <br/>Come l’anno scorso, la parte fondamentale siete voi, perché se riusciremo a pubblicare questo diario sarà solo grazie al vostro contributo.</p>
<h3><strong>Come utilizzeremo i soldi raccolti?</strong></h3>
<p>Come detto prima, siamo dei normali studenti del classico e di conseguenza non abbiamo la possibilità di stampare diari in larga scala senza sapere il numero preciso di copie. <br/>Per questo motivo abbiamo deciso di appoggiarci a Indiegogo per far partire il progetto. <br/>Per potervi fornire un diario di qualità abbiamo bisogno di raggiungere un obiettivo di circa 2500 euro con i quali potremmo stampare i diari e spedirli direttamente a casa vostra.</p>
<h3><strong>Cosa riceverete?</strong></h3>
<p>Con un ordine riceverete il nostro diario (stavolta col filino segna giorni!), all’apparenza un’agenda come tutte le altre, però pensata appositamente da classicisti per classicisti.<br/>Abbiamo pensato che tutti dovrebbero farsi due risate anche a scuola, magari durante l’ora di greco, e per questo motivo abbiamo concepito l’idea del diario.<br/>Il pacco contenente uno o più diari sarà spedito a casa vostra tramite il corriere Bartolini, che assicura tracciabilità e sicurezza, un notevole miglioramento rispetto all’anno scorso.</p>
<h3><strong>Altri modi per aiutare</strong></h3>
<p>Oltre a prendere il diario ci sono altri modi con i quali ci potete aiutare: parlandone con gli amici di classe, di scuola e perché no, magari anche con i professori, che forse riusciranno a capire quello che proviamo ogni giorno. In fondo ci troviamo tutti sulla stessa barca, no?<br/>Comunque vada la campagna, vi vogliamo ringraziare per l’affetto che ci fate sentire ogni giorno sulla nostra pagina, di cui voi siete parte integrante.</p>
<p>Grazie mille e vale, classicisti!</p>

<h3>
<strong>Story of My Book</strong><br/> </h3>
<p><strong><i>First-Gen, NextGen</i> is a book that explores the first-generation Latinx experience in the American workplace, focusing on the first five years of a young professional's career.</strong><br/><br/>My name is Victoria Banuelos and I am the author of <i>First-Gen, NextGen</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore what successful Latinx business leaders and entrepreneurs accomplished in the first five years of their careers to accelerate their leadership potential. I also wanted to examine the workplace through the lens of first-gen Latinx individuals and the cultural factors that shape our experiences. Latinx and Hispanic individuals are often grouped into a monolithic cohort when in reality, there are subsets of nationalities, generational influences, and cultural understandings that shape our approach to work. I believe the oversimplification of our identity limits the perceived contributions and value-add that we bring to our workplaces.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will see how Latinx business leaders have navigated the already complex work environment with resilience and integrity. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion in an authentic, proactive way. Ultimately, I see this book as a tool to help first-generation students accelerate their leadership potential in the first five years of their career and a way to helping corporate America understand how first-gen colleagues, employees, and peers perceive the workplace.</p>
<p>You'll get insights into why <i>echandole ganas</i> (working hard) is often not enough for first-gens to reach their career goals, how Latinx young professionals feel they fit into the workplace, and how the effects of these sentiments impact the overall leadership pipeline of corporate America.<br/><br/><strong>You'll learn from:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ingrid Otero-Smart, CEO of Casanova//McCann, about how she turned her first advertising job in Puerto Rico into an opportunity that led her to the top position of one of the most renowned ad agencies in the world.</li>
<li>Ryan Renteria, a Goldman Sachs alum who became a partner at a capital management firm at twenty-five years old, retired at 30 and made a career pivot into sports analysis for the Indiana Pacers.</li>
<li>Jocelyn Ramirez, author and owner of <i>Todo Verde</i>, a vegan Mexican food enterprise with a diehard social media following and a rapidly growing catering segment.</li>
<li>and many others!</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>​<strong><i>First-Gen, NextGen </i></strong>is a nonfiction book that speaks to first-gen Latinx students, early-career young professionals, and employers who want to enrich corporate culture, create more inclusive spaces, and embrace the business case for a diverse labor force.</p>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you are all about supporting a diverse environment in the workplace and changing the nature of work for the better. For me, hearing the ""lessons learned"" from first-generation Latinx professionals and entrepreneurs who have successfully created a path in the way they earn their living was an incredible opportunity. Each of them is excited to share their genuine teachings with you.</p>
<p>We want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of authenticity and the true faces of leadership in the workplace.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book: First-Gen, NextGen</strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 How We Got Here: Foreword + Introduction + Chapters 1-3.</strong><br/>We introduce the meaning of Latinx (instead of Latino/a), as defined by various first-generation voices. We will explore how our upbringing and cultural perspectives shape the way we approach work. Then we dive into the <i>echale ganas</i> fallacy and why 'hard work' is often not enough for first-gens to accelerate their leadership potential, especially in the first five years of their career. This section also features a foreword by Frank Carbajal, founder of the Silicon Valley Latino Leadership Summit and consulting firm, Es Tiempo.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 Principles of Accelerants: Chapters 4-9</strong><br/>Here we dig into specific examples of the accelerant principles and what this mindset looks like through a variety of stories from Latinx business leaders, such as the CEO of Casanova//McCann, the Executive Director of a global non-profit, a Global Head at Microsoft, a Goldman Sachs alum, culinary author, Hollywood actress, and more. We also look at the strategies used by Latinx employees in tech, advertising, finance, healthcare, and historically underrepresented industries. From code-switching at work to building social capital, you'll see how relatable the workplace challenges are for many first-generation folks and how to leverage proven strategies to engage with work successfully.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 How to Use Your Accelerants: Chapters 10-11</strong><br/>In the final section, we'll reveal how first-generation Latinx students and young professionals can develop their personal accelerants by breaking through mental hurdles and identifying the systemic ones. We'll see how Latinx wellness and therapy professionals have supported their Latinx patients with strategies to balance their authentic identity with corporate America's existing structure. Additionally, we'll take a look at how employers can support, enable, and empower their teams and organizations to create a more inclusive environment - not just for Latinx employees but for their workforce at large.<br/> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered why our world is speeding faster and faster toward anger, shame and polarization?  Or what’s the solution for church conflicts and increasing family skirmishes? At personal level, have you ever struggled with inferiority, or outburst of anger, where you say or do stupid things, because you are feeling anxious, insecure, attacked or hurt?   </p>
<p>What do you crave?  Is there a hunger for more relational connection?  More success?  More meaning?  We all have had to deal with these hunger pains before.  The question is how?</p>
<p>My name is David Braun, author of Are We All Cannibals?  I wrote this manuscript back in 2017…    and then life got busy, putting a pause on it's release.  Then the pandemic of 2020 hit us all, unveiling a train wreck of fear-fueled political unrest and racial tension.  In August of 2020, a good friend of mine asked me to seriously pursue publishing this book.  Days later my wife echoed the same encouragement.  We feel the time for this message is now.  We are planning on publishing this book on Amazon  in March.  </p>

<p>The global insecurity, polarization and anxiety, due to the pandemic, political uncertainty and economic hardship, reveals a visceral need for the light and hope and practical guidance my book offers.  Part of Are We All Cannibals  is  my story and how God met me in a new and fresh way.  Through writing this book, I’ve learned to be transparent as I share my personal weaknesses and insecurities.  For the past 7 years I have been sharing and teaching the truths in this book around the world ( North and South America, Asia and my home country, Canada)        I have been learning to grow in these truths myself, while seeing others touched and set free. </p>
<p><strong>Some of the Highlights in the Book:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong><u>Your Basic Motivators…   </u></strong></li></ul>
<p>God created everyone with the same core needs.  These core needs first revealed in the gospels, directs every decision, behavior, and attitude we have.  My book will explore how we can meet our needs to live to our fullest potential.</p>

<ul><li><strong><u>Orphan Shadow Types…   </u></strong></li></ul>
<p>There are several basic ways humans react, when trapped in insecurity or fear.  These types of behaviors limit us in our all decisions, our ability for personal growth and our ability to enjoy relationships.  My book will examine these basic survival strategies through scripture.  Through this study you will be able to identify the types hidden in your life.</p>

<p>Based on what Jesus did at the cross, we already carry a powerful impulse to live differently than a depraved world.  True fulfillment comes by letting our Father show us who we already are in Jesus.  My book will help you unpack your unique impact style.  Stories and examples will explain how simple and powerful it is to live with impact and meaning.</p>

<h3>Ways For More Impact Beyond the Book</h3>
<p>As a certified professional coach, mediator and consultant, with years of experience teaching this material, I've decided to offer 3 different tracks and resource you with tools to see the message of this book carry beyond the pages and into your day to day life.</p>
<p><strong>Track 1:  My Impact Growth Program (3 month)</strong></p>
<p>This 3-month personal development track is based on my book, Are We All Cannibals?  It will include monthly training on topics such as goal setting, communication, conflict, and your Personal Impact Style.  Group coaching and email Q &amp; A will give you an opportunity to realize meaningful transformation. </p>
<p><strong>Track 2:  My Leadership Impact Growth Program (3 month)</strong></p>
<p>This 3-month journey is based on my book, Are We All Cannibals?  It will include monthly training on topics such as decision-making, team building, conflict, and your Personal Impact Style.  Group coaching and email Q&amp;A will give you an opportunity to realize meaningful change. </p>
<p><strong>Track 3:  My Relationship Growth Program (3 month)  </strong></p>
<p>This 3-month adventure is based on my book, Are We All Cannibals?  It will include monthly training on topics such as communication, intimacy, conflict, and your Personal Impact Style.  Group coaching and email Q &amp; A will give you an opportunity to realize meaningful ways forward. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sharing a message that has been transformative to me and others is exciting.  Part of the reason I decided to fund raise on this platform is because there are challenges to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Money</u>:  The cost of this project was around $4000.  The price tag includes the editing process, cover design, layout, formatting and book launch website.  Whatever remainder amount we can raise will go directly toward marketing of this message to as many people as possible.  .</li>
<li>
<u>Marketing</u>:  I believe the whole world needs this message so I’m really believing we can raise much more than $5000.  Therefore, donations above $4000 will go directly toward advertising.  In fact, we have already recorded several video ads to use on Facebook to spread the word.</li>
<li>
<u>Pandemic</u>:  Because of a global pandemic, it is much harder to market books.  Opportunities such as book signings and conference speaking, and in person readings are not possible.   However, good news spreads the quickest by simple word of mouth.  As you all know, I am not a well known name...    but that doesn't matter.  I need people like you sharing and inviting others to buy the book on Amazon or check out the book webpage:  <a href=""http://areweallcannibals.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.areweallcannibals.com</a>.  </li>

<h3>What Makes the Book Special</h3>
<p>Are We All Cannibals, brings together a Biblically-based lens for understanding how our core needs, our toxic human reactions and our new identity in Christ affect us, our walk with God and our world. As an executive coach, pastor and consultant, I have looked to find a <i>Bible-based</i> psychometric test (think DiSC, MBTI or Enneagram) to use for my clients and congregants.  I came up empty.  This book lays out the foundations for the first Bible-based Psychometric Test I'm aware of connecting core needs, your walk with God &amp; your impact in the world…      </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Have you ever wondered why our world is speeding faster and faster toward anger, shame and polarization?  Or what’s the solution for church conflicts and increasing family skirmishes? At personal level, have you ever struggled with inferiority, or outburst of anger, where you say or do stupid things, because you are feeling anxious, insecure, attacked or hurt?   
What do you crave?  Is there a hunger for more relational connection?  More success?  More meaning?  We all have had to deal with these hunger pains before.  The question is how?
My name is David Braun, author of Are We All Cannibals?  I wrote this manuscript back in 2017…    and then life got busy, putting a pause on it's release.  Then the pandemic of 2020 hit us all, unveiling a train wreck of fear-fueled political unrest and racial tension.  In August of 2020, a good friend of mine asked me to seriously pursue publishing this book.  Days later my wife echoed the same encouragement.  We feel the time for this message is now.  We are planning on publishing this book on Amazon  in March.  
 

What We Need & What You Get
This book will be published with Kindle Direct Publishing.  I have set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.  Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor and I will work to revise and publish my manuscript on March 12, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mock-ups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, e-book formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The book website for promoting and giving online resources for my book.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book, when I ultimately publish this coming Spring.

I am also offering some exclusive treats for people who pre-order my book now:

You can receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
You can receive early access to my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You can have the opportunity to be entered in a draw for a chance to give direct input on the cover of my book.  (please refer to apple on front cover of my book mock-up).  All my children are gleefully proud their faces, in miniature, will be on the front cover…   LOL. * see FAQ for more details
You will be invited to join my private online Facebook community called Cannibals No More and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Fall is a coming-of-age narrative that follows the life of a college freshman learning to deal with loss, influence, and identity.<br/><br/>The title represents a fall from grace and the descent before hitting rock bottom. The fall is a period of uncertainty and adversity where it feels as if one “needs directions and manuals for this story mode."" <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover value in the experiences that influence your persona, both good and bad. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with self-doubt, mental health, and apprehension, as well as to discover the significance of contentment in your life. <br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in exploring the mindset of a first-generation college student and discovering themes of apprehension, self-doubt, and identity through poems like: </p>
<p>“The Fall” — This composition reflects on the fear of knowing hardship is knocking on your door, and portrays the mindset of somebody anticipating failure. </p>
<p>“Writer’s Block” — This composition details the struggle of a self-deprecating mentality when pursuing goals. Self sabotage can only hinder you from seeing your own greatness...</p>
<p>“Pulpit” — This poem details the importance of finding fulfillment in yourself and all of your success. In this composition, the narrator comes to terms that his own contentment is the key to wholeness.</p>You will love this book if you share a love for rap music, are a college bound student or are currently enrolled, or if you deal with the pressure of an uncertain future. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope this book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>Do I place enough value in every milestone?</p>
<p>Can one rise above the influence in a negative environment?</p>
<p>How can I confront fear in the face of the unknown?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing discontentment, negative influence, and apprehension will change us all for the better. </p>

<b><br/></b><p></p>
<p><i>Delight in Disorder:
Ministry, Madness, Mission</i>
is the story of my battle with bipolar disorder—how my faith has at times
fueled emotional distortion yet ultimately has fostered healing.</p>
<p>In 1995, I was a young, ambitious
pastor serving a small village church. 
One Sunday, I delivered a sermon on human illness and divine healing in
which I shared these words:</p>
<blockquote><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When
we become ill, it is important to listen to our bodies and pray that God help us make necessary changes. Our ailments may be blessings in disguise. We may be
expecting too much from ourselves, or avoiding things we need to face. As we
listen to our bodies, talk and reflect with others, and pray together, we can gain spiritual insight which will help us live healthier, more productive, more abundant lives.</i></blockquote>
<p>The next day, I
was in the seclusion room of a psychiatric hospital.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I was told I would never work as a pastor
again, that my marriage would likely end, and that I would spend the rest of my
life in and out of psychiatric hospitals.</p>
<p>By the grace of
God and with much help from others, I served another dozen years of fruitful
ministry, have been married “for better and for worse” for twenty three years
and have progressed in treatment to enjoy what my psychiatrist calls
“maintenance remission.”  </p>
<p>Having served in
ministry with madness, I now have a mission, and I could use your help.</p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b><i>The Mission</i></b></h2>
<p>Many people with mental illness
are angry at God, at believers and at faith communities.  People within churches struggle to
understand mental illness in light of Biblical teaching.  I have lived in both worlds and wrestle daily
with my dual identity as a Christian who has a serious mental illness.</p>
<p>My mission is to bridge the distance
between faith and mental illness-- fostering faith among those with disorders
and diagnoses and promoting compassion within the faith community.  Sharing my spiritual memoir is the first step
towards this mission.</p>
<h3>Mission Endorsement:</h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>Delight in Disorder <em>is a resource we have long needed. We all need to hear from people who have struggled with mental illness and have found, indeed, that nothing can separate us from God’s great and redeeming love. This book is honest about the experience of living with bipolar disorder, and it’s full of compassion toward the many people whose own moods betray them so treacherously. It’s also full of hope—not the cheap kind we use to varnish over the truth about ourselves and about this life we live. But the only kind of hope that can stand when everything else falls: hope in Christ and his grace.<br/></em> </blockquote>

<h2><i>From my Memoir</i></h2>
<p>Over the past several years now,
I’ve often wondered how I could be in a personal relationship with the LORD and
still have tried to take my life.  Attempting suicide, while often
prompted by disturbed minds (like mine), is an ultimate act of ingratitude for
the life God has given us.  Yet, after my attempt, I felt drawn closer to
God more than ever.  Perhaps out of desperation.  Perhaps out of
desire.</p>
<p>Some talk about the “assurance of
salvation” – once saved, always saved.  Others point to Bible passages
that show it is possible to “fall from grace.” I’ve thought hard and prayed
deep about the subject and have yet to come to any conclusions.  I can
only say that, in my life, while there have been plenty of times I’ve felt like
giving up on God, God has never given up on me.  </p>
<p>I don’t always <i>feel</i> secure in
my salvation, but I do <i>know </i>the power of Christ’s saving love first-hand
in my life.  </p>
<p>God has brought me back from the
dead.  In Christ, I have hope for abundant life with him now and forever.</p>
<p>The Psalmists show us that those who
look to the LORD for salvation experience how intimately God is connected to
us. God sees our troubles even before they are troubles. God knows our grief
and grieves with us. When we feel the most helpless, we can turn to the LORD
and be swept up in God’s warm embrace.</p>
<p>When I came to my senses in the
hospital bed after my suicide attempt, I had to face the reality that I had tried to
abandon God.  At the same time, I discovered God had not abandoned
me.  I say this not to brag about my standing with God – indeed I have no
standing with God. I say this instead with tremendous gratitude and wonder that
God would take notice of me—even me.

Message



Delight in Disorder:
Ministry, Madness, Mission
is the story of my battle with bipolar disorder—how my faith has at times
fueled emotional distortion yet ultimately has fostered healing.
In 1995, I was a young, ambitious
pastor serving a small village church. 
One Sunday, I delivered a sermon on human illness and divine healing in
which I shared these words:
When
we become ill, it is important to listen to our bodies and pray that God help us make necessary changes. Our ailments may be blessings in disguise. We may be
expecting too much from ourselves, or avoiding things we need to face. As we
listen to our bodies, talk and reflect with others, and pray together, we can gain spiritual insight which will help us live healthier, more productive, more abundant lives.
The next day, I
was in the seclusion room of a psychiatric hospital.  I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  I was told I would never work as a pastor
again, that my marriage would likely end, and that I would spend the rest of my
life in and out of psychiatric hospitals.
By the grace of
God and with much help from others, I served another dozen years of fruitful
ministry, have been married “for better and for worse” for twenty three years
and have progressed in treatment to enjoy what my psychiatrist calls
“maintenance remission.”  
Having served in
ministry with madness, I now have a mission, and I could use your help.

The Mission
Many people with mental illness
are angry at God, at believers and at faith communities.  People within churches struggle to
understand mental illness in light of Biblical teaching.  I have lived in both worlds and wrestle daily
with my dual identity as a Christian who has a serious mental illness.
My mission is to bridge the distance
between faith and mental illness-- fostering faith among those with disorders
and diagnoses and promoting compassion within the faith community.  Sharing my spiritual memoir is the first step
towards this mission.
Mission Endorsement:

Delight in Disorder is a resource we have long needed. We all need to hear from people who have struggled with mental illness and have found, indeed, that nothing can separate us from God’s great and redeeming love. This book is honest about the experience of living with bipolar disorder, and it’s full of compassion toward the many people whose own moods betray them so treacherously. It’s also full of hope—not the cheap kind we use to varnish over the truth about ourselves and about this life we live. But the only kind of hope that can stand when everything else falls: hope in Christ and his grace. 
~Amy Simpson -- Author, Troubled Minds: Mental Illness and the Church’s Mission



The Man Behind the Memoir 

                                
My name is Tony
Roberts.  I am a balding middle-aged
Midwesterner with an unquiet mind who has a way with words. 
I have been divinely blessed with
a devoted wife and four beautiful children. 
Yet, I continually struggle to be a supportive husband and stable father
and am currently separated from my family.
After serving nearly two decades
as a pastor, I now write, read, listen to John Prine, and eat peanut
M&Ms.  You can find my work at
awaywithwordsblog.com and reach me through my website awaywithwordsforyou.com. 
My dream is to share the divine
delight I’ve found in the midst of my human disorder.  My nightmare is talking in front of a group
of strangers wearing only a pair of Birkenstocks (but I can save that for
therapy).

My dear mother passed away one year ago this month. The cancer that took her life also put a hold on my work from the time of her diagnosis three years ago.

My mother, my sisters, and me, Salang Pass, 1977I left Afghanistan a year after the Soviet invasion of the country, on the day of my seventh birthday. Now 35 years later, I have the opportunity to return to the country of my birth. And what draws me back is that same voice—the storyteller’s voice. The fairy tales of my childhood were not all innocent. They told of magic and adventure, of love and conquest, but they also told of loss and heartache, of violence and death. After decades of war, the country has countless tales to tell.

My Project

My objectives while in Afghanistan are three-fold:-Interview family in order to gather as much of our history, recent and old, as I can. In a culture where everything is passed down orally (I don’t have a birth certificate, there are no physical records of our family’s history in Afghanistan or of their migrations across Central Asia), my only source is the direct interview. 
-Gather and record traditional Afghani fairy tales told by those whose love for and memory of them is intact.
-Photograph family, the land, and its people.
My objectives on my return:
-Transcribe and translate interviews and fairy tales.
-Incorporate what I’ve gathered into my ongoing projects, which fictionally combine family history and legends with fairy tales and the fantastical. My father's sister and her grandchildren on their farmFor the past five years or so, I have been collecting stories of my family’s personal history. I have spent countless hours interviewing my parents, and aunts and uncles living in the West. What I collect are often only pieces of story, only what those who left the country remember or dare remember. I’ve been collecting these bits in order to create longer and cohesive narratives. I’ve wanted to return to Afghanistan for many years now, and wanted very much to return with both of my parents, to visit their respective birthplaces, in Kabul and in the northern countryside, and to have them as guides into the culture and into their memories. My dear mother passed away one year ago this month. The cancer that took her life also put a hold on my work from the time of her diagnosis three years ago. But now, my father, my two younger sisters, and I want to return to Afghanistan to commemorate her passing and to remember her with her family who still reside in Afghanistan. My father and his friend, Tomb of Ahmad Shah Baba, 1963
With the Taliban trying to regroup under new leadership, and Islamic State gaining a foothold in parts of the country, it seems that the window for travel to the country may soon close again. And yet, the people of Afghanistan, among them my large and extended family, continue with their daily lives, with work, school, weddings and birthdays, outings and holidays. Life goes on for them, continues to unfold and flower. It is this life that I want to see and document. My mother and her mother-in-law, 1969

<p>About the Author:</p>
<p>Donovan graduated from high school in the top 1% of his class with a GPA above a 4.0. Throughout his high school journey, he was a leader within several different organizations, including the National Honor Society, Student Congress, and the Scholars Plus Program. Donovan is a recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship, the Buick Achiever Scholarship, the KFC Colonel’s Scholar Scholarship, among other scholarships. The amount earned in scholarships totaled to over $250,000 and has completely paid for Donovan’s education at the University of Michigan as he studies mechanical engineering. By achieving these scholarships, Donovan has been given the opportunity to appear on several news stations, newspaper articles, and radio shows along with being flown to Texas to see the Final Four and California to attend the UNCF Evening of the Stars. Donovan has always been passionate in helping others and hopes to motivate the youth to achieve their dreams. Donovan strongly believes that no matter where or what you've come from, the key to success is within your grasp, and is waiting to unlock a universe of opportunities.</p>
<p>About the Book:</p>
<p>The Scholar's Key is a teen-to-teen advice book aimed at motivating students to apply for scholarships. It was written shortly after the height of Donovan’s senior year of high school when he received several award letters from national scholarships such as the Gates Millennium Scholarship and the Buick Achiever Scholarship. In this book, Donovan shares how molding your future begins with self-reflection, and motivates you to act on your goals. The Scholar's Key isn't just limited to scholarship tips. This book includes a variety of elements such as poetry, personal stories, college advice for freshmen, and several stories from other fellow scholarship recipients from the class of 2011. On the road to achieving your dreams, The Scholar’s Key encourages you to be the first person to tell yourself to stand up to the challenge, focus on what you dream of doing, and have fun throughout your pursuit of happiness.  </p>

<p>Jusqu'ici toutefois, aucun ne s'était attaqué aux fausses nouvelles en science — et en français ! Le<b> Détecteur de rumeurs</b> comblera cette lacune. </p>
<p>Et à l'Agence Science-Presse — un média à but non lucratif — nous sommes bien placés pour le faire : depuis 37 ans, l'Agence décode l'actualité plutôt que de simplement la rapporter. </p>
<p>Mais pour offrir à nos lecteurs une rubrique de vérification des faits digne de ce nom, il faudra un effort soutenu et de longue haleine (les <i>Décodeurs</i> y consacrent 10 personnes !). De plus, en démarrant cette rubrique, nous ne voulons pas seulement réagir aux actualités douteuses : nous créerons des outils qui vous serviront à vous faire vous-mêmes critiques lorsque vous serez à votre tour confrontés à une nouvelle trop belle pour être vraie. Ces textes et outils pourront aussi être partagés, y compris par d'autres médias. </p>

Même des médias sérieux tombent parfois dans le piège. Résultat, il est difficile de départager le vrai du faux, surtout quand on n'est pas soi-même outillé pour le faire. 


Vous voulez lutter contre cette désinformation ? Embauchez un journaliste scientifique ! 



Un journaliste scientifique, pourquoi ? 



Chacun de ces dérapages aurait pu être évité grâce à un journaliste scientifique. Parce que les journalistes scientifiques savent :

 repérer les informations scientifiques solides ;
 remettre en contexte ;
 trouver des sources fiables.



Seulement voilà, le journalisme scientifique n'a jamais été une priorité dans les médias et à l'heure où ces derniers vivent une crise, il est encore plus fragile que jamais. 

Aidez-nous à renverser la tendance! Faisons du journalisme scientifique une priorité dans les salles de presse! Primordial, au moment où notre société fait de plus en plus face à des enjeux scientifiques... et où les fausses nouvelles deviennent virales sur Internet. 

Une rubrique de vérification des faits, pourquoi ?



Ces dernières années, plusieurs médias sur trois continents ont pris les choses en main en créant des rubriques de vérification des faits (fact-checking) : des Décodeurs du journal Le Monde jusqu'à Politifact aux États-Unis. Leur succès démontre l'appétit du public pour des textes qui remettent les pendules à l'heure et fournissent des outils contre la désinformation. Ces médias se sont attaqués avec brio aux déclarations politiques douteuses et aux rumeurs virales. 
Jusqu'ici toutefois, aucun ne s'était attaqué aux fausses nouvelles en science — et en français ! Le Détecteur de rumeurs comblera cette lacune. 
Et à l'Agence Science-Presse — un média à but non lucratif — nous sommes bien placés pour le faire : depuis 37 ans, l'Agence décode l'actualité plutôt que de simplement la rapporter. 
Mais pour offrir à nos lecteurs une rubrique de vérification des faits digne de ce nom, il faudra un effort soutenu et de longue haleine (les Décodeurs y consacrent 10 personnes !). De plus, en démarrant cette rubrique, nous ne voulons pas seulement réagir aux actualités douteuses : nous créerons des outils qui vous serviront à vous faire vous-mêmes critiques lorsque vous serez à votre tour confrontés à une nouvelle trop belle pour être vraie. Ces textes et outils pourront aussi être partagés, y compris par d'autres médias. 
Besoin de plus d'infos sur ce qu'est une rubrique de vérification de faits? Notre texte ici. 
À quoi servira votre contribution ?
En soutenant Le Détecteur de rumeurs, vous financez le journalisme scientifique : un journalisme qui prend le temps de vérifier, réfléchir, approfondir, analyser. 

Nos textes comporteront deux volets: une version ""courte"" pour ceux qui ont besoin d'une réponse rapide, facile à diffuser par les réseaux sociaux, et une version plus ""substantielle"", incluant un retour sur la nouvelle originale, l'explication, les faits connus et inconnus, des chiffres et des références, des trucs et astuces pour qui serait confronté à des nouvelles similaires, ainsi qu'une description de la démarche de vérification suivie par le journaliste pour en arriver à son verdict — vrai, faux, ou entre les deux. 
Votre contribution sera une première étape pour lancer cette rubrique et démontrer sa pertinence auprès des bailleurs de fonds. La somme recueillie servira exclusivement à la production de contenu (textes journalistiques et éventuellement infographies, vidéos et guide des bonnes pratiques) et sera versée en totalité à notre équipe de journalistes.
Nos objectifs



Créons ensemble une nouvelle habitude : au lieu de partager une nouvelle sur un ananas qui guérit le cancer, demandez à un journaliste  scientifique de la vérifier! 


Un effort participatif

Donnez, mais surtout participez avec nous ! Nous serons à l'écoute de vos suggestions de nouvelles à vérifier. Impliquez-vous : nous créerons lors de la prochaine assemblée annuelle de l'Agence Science-Presse, en juin, un comité de rédaction du Détecteur de rumeurs où tous les donateurs seront invités à élire un représentant qui se fera porteur de leurs idées.

<h3>About My Book</h3>
<p><i>Playing From The Rough</i> is about how a single mother, raised in Oakland, California single handedly takes on the golf industry and starts a movement to get more Black women on the golf course.</p>
<p>My name is Tiffany Mack Fitzgerald and I am the author of <i>Playing From The Rough</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted Black women and girls to see themselves succeeding in unlikely spaces. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how much power you have when you stop waiting to be invited into spaces you want to be in and create a space for yourself, like I did when I created the Black Girls Golf organization. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for golf and how I use my knowledge of golf to empower Black women through community building and sisterhood. Ultimately, I want readers to see this book as a tool to help them shed the stereotypes you’ve heard about golf being a White man’s sport and learn how you too can use golf as a tool to create opportunities, overcome obstacles, and build confidence.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the power of community, sisterhood, the rewards associated with adding golf to your lifestyle, and how learning to golf can help you navigate new territory and male dominated spaces.<br/>You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>My first time on the golf course and how I used it to build a relationship with my male colleagues</li>
<li>Being “The Black Girl in Marketing”</li>
<li>The “aha” moment I had about how the challenges I faced during my childhood, and how they helped me overcome the obstacles I faced building my business</li>
<li>Playing From The Rough is a nonfiction book that speaks to Black women and young professionals who want to learn about golf or how to leverage it to show up in White, male dominated spaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About The Author</h3>
<p>Tiffany Fitzgerald is a skilled entrepreneur who bootstrapped her way to becoming an industry influencer. She’s on a mission to get more African American women and girls on the golf course and working in the golf industry. Having spent more than 20 years in Corporate America, 10 of those years in Government Affairs and PR, Tiffany understood the role golf played in building successful, professional relationships. She also recognized the absence of African American women on the golf course.<br/><br/>In 2013 she founded Black Girls Golf, an organization that provides access to affordable golf instruction, golf information and community for women who are interested in learning, practicing, and playing golf. Tiffany has grown Black Girls Golf to a community of more than 4,000 members in almost all 50 states and 9 countries, the largest golf community in the United States for African American women and girls. She’s writing this book to help Black women understand the impact of their presence on a golf course and to encourage them to add golf to their lifestyle.<br/><br/>Tiffany is a native of Oakland, CA; an alumna of Grambling State University; the mother of three children; and currently resides in Atlanta, GA.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Tiffany at info@blackgirlsgolf.net and <a href=""http://facebook.com/groups/blackgirlsgolfclubhouse,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, Instagram: <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/blackgirlsgolf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@blackgirlsgolf</a>, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/blackgirlsgolf/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a><br/> </p>

I teach English at a few schools in Michigan and also at an undisclosed prison (no I won't tell you where). I am also a writer and I want to better offer it to the public.</p><p>For the past few years I have been working on a variety of short stories and projects revolving around superheroes. I'm no pretender to this style, as I have been a fan of comics my entire life. My first released short story “Christmas Ashcan” stars my character Kirk Loebs and has received many five star reviews on Amazon. I have plans to release one short story per month for the foreseeable future featuring Loebs and other characters. There will be no delays in between the stories, since there are always two or three ready to go as the next one is released.</p><p>Additionally, I am working on a play called <i>Deflection: A Superhero Drama</i>. It is a courtroom drama starring the previously mentioned Kirk Loebs. <i>Deflection</i> is a solid play that has already gotten many great reviews from theatrical producers I've shown it to. The play is gaining some traction and I am working toward producing it this summer. Should that not work out, I will release the play as part of the monthly range I am working on. Because I am so proud of the story, I would like to get a name artist to do the play's poster/cover.</p><p>I also released a short academic book, <i>Study Guide to the Lives of Harry Lime</i>, in 2017. <i>The Lives of Harry Lime</i> is a relatively little-known radio series starring Orson Welles as his character from <i>The Third Man</i>. My book is the first in-depth look into the radio series. The book is an early companion piece to my in progress book about Orson Welles' commercials. </p><p>For book on a niche topic, <i>Study Guide</i> has sold close to 100 copies. My short story, “Christmas Ashcan” has been downloaded nearly 200 times and continues to be read in full on Amazon's Kindle lending services well past the holiday season. </p><p>Finally, my next short story, ""Lake Drift,"" will be out by the end of January 2019.</p><p>These sales all come from a modest amount of promotion on my Facebook page and other sources. This isn't because I'm not interested in promoting my work! My work as a college instructor comes first, so that job is my priority. I am happy with my progress, but advertising online can cost a lot, and I don't make enough to constantly keep my name out there for people to recognize. I am happy to see the sales figures from my modest promotion, but I know the potential to go bigger is there.</p><p>I'd like to see what happens if I can fully concentrate on promoting and selling my work. Considering my topics of interest, I believe the best place to promote my work would be at the 30th annual Motor City Comic Con coming in May 2019.</p><p>The Motor City Comic Con grows bigger each and every year. Since it is the 30th annual edition of the convention, there are sure to be more people there than ever, and this seems like the best place to launch the next stage of my writing career.</p><p>Unfortunately, at the moment, I don't have the funds to immediately secure a table. I'm only a part-time instructor, and my funds are currently tied up with other living expenses. The guest list for the con is already shaping up to be big, and I think it goes without saying that tables will be in high demand. I earn enough money that I could get a table eventually, but I highly doubt I could raise enough on my own before space is gone.</p><p>This is where you come in.</p><p>Funds raised through this campaign will go toward reserving a table for me at Motor City Comic Con this year, along with stock for the table, promotional items, and a cover/poster for my play.</p><p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p><p>Contributions to the campaign will go to the following:</p><ul>
<li>A table reservation at Motor City Comic Con where I can sell some great stories </li>
<li>Stock at my table (Physical copies of <i>Study Guide to the Lives of Harry Lime</i>, physical samples of digital short stories, copies of a decoupage superhero story I am working on, and potentially copies <i>Deflection</i>, should production fall through)</li>
<li>A professionally illustrated cover/poster for<i> Deflection: A Superhero Drama</i>
</li>
<li>Indiegogo's commission</li>
<li>Perks</li>
</ul><p>Perks include the shorts and books I have written, special thanks in future stories/books, and  if there is enough interest, even a few autographed comics from my personal collection!</p><p>Should I fall short of the campaign goal, at very least the funds will go toward getting me a table at the show or bringing in promotional items to show to the right people.</p><p><strong>Impact</strong></p><ul>
<li>My works reach a wider audience than I normally can reach</li>
<li>I have the chance to pass along my stories to other writers attending the convention</li>
<li>Earn extra money to produce better illustrations, photos, or more stories more often than once a month</li>
<li>Professionally illustrated and/or photographed covers give credibility and visibility to my stories</li>
<li>I keep to my deadlines and promises, so there will be a short story once per month</li>
</ul><p>My works are already proven successes. “Christmas Ashcan” was downloaded nearly 200 times within the first five days of its release in December 2108. The Harry Lime book is also a success. I have sold nearly 100 copies of the book since July 2017, an impressive number for a radio series that only aired for a year in the early 1950's.  Both titles have sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. I'm no Geoff Johns or John Grisham, but I'm working on it.</p><p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p>Of course, I'm a relatively unknown commodity. I don't have the name recognition that other artists using this site may have. At the moment I only have one book and one short story available to the public.</p><p>However, I believe that this seeming lack of recognition is easy to overcome.</p><p>My two releases through Amazon both have five star ratings and have strong sales in spite of the lack of promotion. As mentioned, the Harry Lime book is as niche as it gets, but I'm closing in on 100 copies sold since its release in July 2017. “Christmas Ashcan” was downloaded nearly 200 times within five days of its release. If these modest numbers are any indicator, I will successfully be able to sell my works at comic con.</p><p>Of course, should I fall short of my goal, I will still use funds to get a table at comic con. Your contributions will help ensure that.</p><p>Should table space be unavailable by the time I get my funds together, I will use the contributions to still promote my works at comic con through promotional items and pieces that I can leave at tables or with writers and artists that I respect.</p><p>You can check out my Amazon reviews, plus an interview I did for the Harry Lime book at the following pages:</p><p>""Christmas Ashcan"" <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Ashcan-Jacob-Loebs-Adventure-ebook/dp/B07M97LVJJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Ashcan-Jacob-L...</a></p><p>Study Guide to the Lives of Harry Lime: <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Study-Guide-Lives-Harry-Lime/dp/1548358959"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/Study-Guide-Lives-Harry-...</a></p><p>Interview at Wellesnet: <a href=""http://www.wellesnet.com/study-guide-lives-harry-lime-sheds-light-radio-series/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wellesnet.com/study-guide-lives-harr...</a></p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Share this!

Since it is the 30th annual edition of the convention, there are sure to be more people there than ever, and this seems like the best place to launch the next stage of my writing career.Unfortunately, at the moment, I don't have the funds to immediately secure a table. I'm only a part-time instructor, and my funds are currently tied up with other living expenses. The guest list for the con is already shaping up to be big, and I think it goes without saying that tables will be in high demand. I earn enough money that I could get a table eventually, but I highly doubt I could raise enough on my own before space is gone.This is where you come in.Funds raised through this campaign will go toward reserving a table for me at Motor City Comic Con this year, along with stock for the table, promotional items, and a cover/poster for my play.What We Need and What You GetContributions to the campaign will go to the following:
A table reservation at Motor City Comic Con where I can sell some great stories 
Stock at my table (Physical copies of Study Guide to the Lives of Harry Lime, physical samples of digital short stories, copies of a decoupage superhero story I am working on, and potentially copies Deflection, should production fall through)
A professionally illustrated cover/poster for Deflection: A Superhero Drama

Indiegogo's commission
Perks
Perks include the shorts and books I have written, special thanks in future stories/books, and  if there is enough interest, even a few autographed comics from my personal collection!Should I fall short of the campaign goal, at very least the funds will go toward getting me a table at the show or bringing in promotional items to show to the right people.Impact
My works reach a wider audience than I normally can reach
I have the chance to pass along my stories to other writers attending the convention
Earn extra money to produce better illustrations, photos, or more stories more often than once a month
Professionally illustrated and/or photographed covers give credibility and visibility to my stories
I keep to my deadlines and promises, so there will be a short story once per month
My works are already proven successes. “Christmas Ashcan” was downloaded nearly 200 times within the first five days of its release in December 2108. The Harry Lime book is also a success. I have sold nearly 100 copies of the book since July 2017, an impressive number for a radio series that only aired for a year in the early 1950's.  Both titles have sold in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam. I'm no Geoff Johns or John Grisham, but I'm working on it.Risks and ChallengesOf course, I'm a relatively unknown commodity. I don't have the name recognition that other artists using this site may have. At the moment I only have one book and one short story available to the public.However, I believe that this seeming lack of recognition is easy to overcome.My two releases through Amazon both have five star ratings and have strong sales in spite of the lack of promotion. As mentioned, the Harry Lime book is as niche as it gets, but I'm closing in on 100 copies sold since its release in July 2017. “Christmas Ashcan” was downloaded nearly 200 times within five days of its release. If these modest numbers are any indicator, I will successfully be able to sell my works at comic con.Of course, should I fall short of my goal, I will still use funds to get a table at comic con. Your contributions will help ensure that.Should table space be unavailable by the time I get my funds together, I will use the contributions to still promote my works at comic con through promotional items and pieces that I can leave at tables or with writers and artists that I respect.You can check out my Amazon reviews, plus an interview I did for the Harry Lime book at the following pages:""Christmas Ashcan"" https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Ashcan-Jacob-L...Study Guide to the Lives of Harry Lime: https://www.amazon.com/Study-Guide-Lives-Harry-...Interview at Wellesnet: http://www.wellesnet.com/study-guide-lives-harr...Other Ways You Can HelpShare this!

<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">About Me And 'Left Behind' Project</span></h2>
<span style=""font-size: medium;"">My name is Carmine Flamminio and I'm a photo-reporter. Being always interested in immigration, I'd never thought of telling it from this angle, of the children left behind.</span>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">'Left Behind' is a long-term photo reportage within the Republic of Moldova. The first victims of migration are children. In Eastern Europe half of those who emigrate are women who, in most cases, leave their children at home, entrusting them, at best, to grandparents, or to elderly neighbors, or at worst, and too often, just abandoning them to fend for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The situation in Moldova makes me question what the real difference is between the developed and undeveloped worlds.

<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Why Moldova</span></h2>
<span style=""font-size: medium;"">I chose the Republic of Moldova because, other than it being one of the poorest nations in Europe, it has a shocking level of emigration, some illegally and without visas, so returning home is at best arduous. But if young Moldovans want any kind of future at all for their children they have to go abroad to work. Moldova is the poorest, the most destitute country in the European continent. Ever since the end of the Soviet Union, It's seen a truly immense exodus of young people. Desolate villages wait for their loved ones to return, they've left the countryside in the hands of children and the elderly. Many children live with their grandparents, but others live completely alone.</span>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The average monthly pay of a teacher in Moldova is about $150. In Italy, a good bricklayer will earn that sum in two days' work. A caregiver will send home over $1,000 a month. Sadly faced with such inequality, many choose to give up what we might consider a normal family life to give hope for a better life to their children. However, in the meantime, Moldova and its abandoned children seem to be caught in an inescapably downward spiral.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In economic terms, migrant remittance, or sending money home, helps to strengthen the financial inflow of a developing country, but it also increases the number of social orphans, children who might count themselves lucky to see their parents but once a year.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The plight of these children is difficult to imagine. Many will never overcome the psychological trauma caused by separation from their parents. Numerous cases of suicide do nothing but highlight how serious the situation is.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">According to the Information and Documentation Center on Child Rights in Moldova, the number of children without parental care is growing steadily. In 2006, there were 94,000 children who had at least one emigrant parent, while in 2009, the number had reached 135,000.</span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: medium;"">WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT</span></h2>
<span style=""font-size: medium;"">'Left Behind' intends to document and give voice to the suffering of these children. By long trips across different regions of Moldova, I will continue my photographic work to tell of the daily lives of both the children left behind and the parents who have emigrated abroad, mainly to Italy. I intend to follow these children in the future during their adolescence. But I have also met many young people who have already reached that age without their parents. They are a separate chapter; yet part of the same story, as are the elderly who often live in unimaginable conditions alone in villages.</span>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The project has only just started and may never end.

'Left Behind' is a long-term photo reportage within the Republic of Moldova. The first victims of migration are children.

<h3>Bringing <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Electric Jesus </span>to the World</h3>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I'm excited to share that my new book <a href=""http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781583943168-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Electric
Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic</span></a><i> </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">has just come out<sup></sup>.<span style="""">  </span>Since I’m working with a small, but
very cool independent publisher, the Evolver Editions imprint with North
Atlantic Books, there’s unfortunately no budget for a book tour.<span style="""">  </span>This memoir has been six years in the
making and I’m reaching out to all of you to help me get the word out through a
multi-city book tour early next year.</span><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The book tells how after experiencing a devastating loss as
a countercultural media activist during the 2004 election, I unwittingly
embarked on a mystical journey marked by underground ayahuasca ceremonies,
kundalini awakenings, prankster spirit guides, extraterrestrial encounters at
the Burning Man festival, and miraculous energy healings that reshaped my
skeptical worldview.<span style="""">  </span>The book
explores the mystical roots of Christianity, uncovers the secrets of alchemical
symbols found in cultures across the globe, and offers visionary insight on how
we can heal our ailing planet.</p>
</div><div style=""font-family: arial;"">
<h3>Healing Christian Wounds<br/>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One thing I’m most passionate about is sharing how early
Christianity was much more mystical, diverse, and different than today’s
dogmatic institutional structures that have been restricting, and often, I believe,
wounding us.<span style="""">  </span><i>The Electric Jesus
</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">shows how early Christianity utilized a
radical initiation process derived from the Mediterranean Mystery Schools to
harness energy in order to achieve gnosis, direct knowledge or
experience of the divine. The book is a healing work, to help those hurt by
current Christian paradigms see that there’s a much juicier, soul-inspiring
tradition available to them if you look past the messed up history and
resulting authoritarian doctrine.<span style=""""> 
</span>After hearing this information at events, people will often 
run up to me excitedly, saying things like, “I always knew my pastor wasn’t telling me
the whole story!”</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-style: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<h3>Visionary Ways to Heal Our Planet<br/>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I’d also like to help spread some of the memes and messages
of an incredible consciousness culture that’s been working hard to shift the
way our planet is headed, which is covered heavily in the book.<span style="""">  As one of the co-founders of the transformational web magazine Reality Sandwich and social network for conscious collaboration, Evolver.net, I've had some amazing front row seats in watching people turn on to new ways of thinking and being.  </span>I also took a big and difficult risk in the last
manuscript draft, finally “coming out of the galactic closet” to mention the
extraterrestrial encounters I’ve experienced as part of my spiritual awakening
process.<span style="""">  </span>I hope this book will
help open some folks up to the vast possibilities of what lies out there in our
universe.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<h3>What Your Contributions Go For:<br/>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As the community director of the Evolver Social Movement, I
coordinate 40+ regional Evolver “Spore” groups in the US and abroad who work to
transform their local communities in positive, sustainable ways.<span style="""">  I see our culture as energetically being a house divided and this is a way to bring people together to share their gifts, passions and resources for the greater good.  </span>Many Spores have hosted readings
in the past for authors like Daniel Pinchbeck, Graham Hancock, Chris Kilham, and Charles Eisenstein.<span style="""">  </span>The book tour will
give me a chance to visit their communities, share stories and information, and
connect with them firsthand about our growing “network of light.”<span style="""">  </span>I will also have couches to crash on to
keep down the cost of the tour.<span style="""">   <br/></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/><span style=""""></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""></span>I’m hoping to do at least an East and West Coast tour in coordination
with these regional groups, and if we raise enough funds, I’d love to hit places in Canada and the middle of America (especially the Bible Belt!).<span style="""">  </span>Since I’m a car-less New Yorker, your contributions will go directly to pay for the  busses, trains,
and airfare to move around (no meals, lodging, or lattes -- I'll take care of that).  If we raise $1,500, I can hit the East and West Coast, with $3,000 I can hit places like Boulder, Denver, SLC, the Southwest, and the South.  With $4,000, I figure I can visit all the Spores in the Continental US and Canada, and maybe some cities where we could jumpstart new Spores to activate local transformations.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>

</div></div>","Bringing The Electric Jesus to the World

I'm excited to share that my new book The Electric
Jesus: The Healing Journey of a Contemporary Gnostic has just come out.  Since I’m working with a small, but
very cool independent publisher, the Evolver Editions imprint with North
Atlantic Books, there’s unfortunately no budget for a book tour.  This memoir has been six years in the
making and I’m reaching out to all of you to help me get the word out through a
multi-city book tour early next year.

The book tells how after experiencing a devastating loss as
a countercultural media activist during the 2004 election, I unwittingly
embarked on a mystical journey marked by underground ayahuasca ceremonies,
kundalini awakenings, prankster spirit guides, extraterrestrial encounters at
the Burning Man festival, and miraculous energy healings that reshaped my
skeptical worldview.  The book
explores the mystical roots of Christianity, uncovers the secrets of alchemical
symbols found in cultures across the globe, and offers visionary insight on how
we can heal our ailing planet.

Healing Christian Wounds


One thing I’m most passionate about is sharing how early
Christianity was much more mystical, diverse, and different than today’s
dogmatic institutional structures that have been restricting, and often, I believe,
wounding us.  The Electric Jesus
shows how early Christianity utilized a
radical initiation process derived from the Mediterranean Mystery Schools to
harness energy in order to achieve gnosis, direct knowledge or
experience of the divine. The book is a healing work, to help those hurt by
current Christian paradigms see that there’s a much juicier, soul-inspiring
tradition available to them if you look past the messed up history and
resulting authoritarian doctrine. 
After hearing this information at events, people will often 
run up to me excitedly, saying things like, “I always knew my pastor wasn’t telling me
the whole story!”

Visionary Ways to Heal Our Planet



I’d also like to help spread some of the memes and messages
of an incredible consciousness culture that’s been working hard to shift the
way our planet is headed, which is covered heavily in the book.  As one of the co-founders of the transformational web magazine Reality Sandwich and social network for conscious collaboration, Evolver.net, I've had some amazing front row seats in watching people turn on to new ways of thinking and being.  I also took a big and difficult risk in the last
manuscript draft, finally “coming out of the galactic closet” to mention the
extraterrestrial encounters I’ve experienced as part of my spiritual awakening
process.  I hope this book will
help open some folks up to the vast possibilities of what lies out there in our
universe.

What Your Contributions Go For:




As the community director of the Evolver Social Movement, I
coordinate 40+ regional Evolver “Spore” groups in the US and abroad who work to
transform their local communities in positive, sustainable ways.  I see our culture as energetically being a house divided and this is a way to bring people together to share their gifts, passions and resources for the greater good.  Many Spores have hosted readings
in the past for authors like Daniel Pinchbeck, Graham Hancock, Chris Kilham, and Charles Eisenstein.  The book tour will
give me a chance to visit their communities, share stories and information, and
connect with them firsthand about our growing “network of light.”  I will also have couches to crash on to
keep down the cost of the tour.   

I’m hoping to do at least an East and West Coast tour in coordination
with these regional groups, and if we raise enough funds, I’d love to hit places in Canada and the middle of America (especially the Bible Belt!).  Since I’m a car-less New Yorker, your contributions will go directly to pay for the  busses, trains,
and airfare to move around (no meals, lodging, or lattes -- I'll take care of that).  If we raise $1,500, I can hit the East and West Coast, with $3,000 I can hit places like Boulder, Denver, SLC, the Southwest, and the South.  With $4,000, I figure I can visit all the Spores in the Continental US and Canada, and maybe some cities where we could jumpstart new Spores to activate local transformations.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you like the message of the book, please share this campaign with your friends and evolutionary allies on Facebook, Twitter, and other places.  Also, I welcome those who read the book to write reviews on Powell's onliine books, Amazon, etc, and share it with your friends.  

Praise for The Electric Jesus



“A modern Odyssey of
awakening, Jonathan Talat Phillips's journey into Gnosticism deeply resonates
with the eccentric moment. The
Electric Jesus, a
spiritual autobiography, reveals a life lived in the light of transformation,
searching for the mystic core of a planetary civilization.” —Alex Grey,
co-founder of the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, author of The Mission of Art

<p>AWAKENINGS Middle East magazine will be a guide to holistic and healthy living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and it’s aimed at people from all religions, cultures, and walks of life, who are searching for new ways of looking at our place in the universe and who believe there’s more to it than the 9 to 6 daily grind and mortgages. It will be the first-of-its-kind for this region… it will also be available globally via subscription, either print or digital formats.</p>
<p>Having lived in Dubai, UAE, for six years, I know there’s an army of people living here who are exploring a more holistic and spiritual approach to life – regardless of their religion or ethnicity. This army is getting bigger by the day. More holistic centres and alternative and complementary health clinics are popping up, more yoga and meditation classes are being offered, more and more people are into everything from acupuncture to angel therapy, Ayurveda, crystal therapy, Feng Shui, NLP, meditation, massage therapy, Pranic healing, reflexology, Reiki, tai chi and so much more.</p>
<p>I want AWAKENINGS to help support and grow this UAE mind, body and spirit community. So the magazine and website and Facebook page is about giving people in this region a focal point and forum for everything to do with holistic living. Whether someone is looking for a local yoga teacher, an organic coffee supplier or a vegan restaurant, they’ll find listings of all the local practitioners, healing and well-being centres, holistic clinics and so on. It’ll give great exposure for people offering alternative health services and be a convenient reference for people searching for these services.</p>
<p>In every issue I plan to features the latest concepts from the world’s thought leaders on spirituality, alternative health and well-being, as well as local interviews, real life stories, local information and listings on everything from finding a hypnotherapist in Abu Dhabi to buying organic produce online in Dubai.</p>

<h3>What I Need...</h3>
<p>How the money will be spent:</p>

<p>$700 ---- A VERY large portion of my budget will be put towards gasoline. I utilized AAA's ""Fuel Cost Calculator"" (<a href=""http://fuelcostcalculator.aaa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fuelcostcalculator.aaa.com/</a>), which utilizes each state's average gas price to give you a rough estimate on your trip. From Chicago to LA, I am looking to spend just under $700 in fuel alone.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$400 ---- My current car is not only a beater, it is a gas guzzler. Not only will I never make it past Kansas City with my car, but it will cost a left arm just to make it 1/4 of the way. I need to rent something sleek like a Honda Civic or a Dodge Charger from a nearby Enterprise. I shopped around, and I can get a rental car for 10 days at this price.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$400 ---- I need food. I also need shelter. Though I have MANY friends throughout the country, I may have to crash a night or two at a hotel/motel somewhere. Consequently, I suspect that I will eat about $200 worth of food and use about $200 in hotel fees.</p>

The Impact
My road trip will not only help me promote my book, but it will allow me to aid others in understanding that they are not alone with both their post-illness issues and/or with their current illnesses.


What I Need...
How the money will be spent:

$700 ---- A VERY large portion of my budget will be put towards gasoline. I utilized AAA's ""Fuel Cost Calculator"" (http://fuelcostcalculator.aaa.com/), which utilizes each state's average gas price to give you a rough estimate on your trip. From Chicago to LA, I am looking to spend just under $700 in fuel alone.

$400 ---- My current car is not only a beater, it is a gas guzzler. Not only will I never make it past Kansas City with my car, but it will cost a left arm just to make it 1/4 of the way. I need to rent something sleek like a Honda Civic or a Dodge Charger from a nearby Enterprise. I shopped around, and I can get a rental car for 10 days at this price.

$400 ---- I need food. I also need shelter. Though I have MANY friends throughout the country, I may have to crash a night or two at a hotel/motel somewhere. Consequently, I suspect that I will eat about $200 worth of food and use about $200 in hotel fees.


... What You Get.

As stated, I will e-mail you a promotional code for 50% off my book, SWIM: A Memoir of Survival. This applies to anybody who donates $10-1,000.

Also, if you pledge over $100, I will make a video announcing you as one of my sponsors and share it on my social networking pages.

If you pledge $200, I will give you two mentions in the videos. 1 post-trip. 1 during the trip (from the road).

If you pledge $300 or more, I will give you a daily plug (One plug each day 3.23.12 - 4.2.12) in either my tweets, touts, Facebook posts, or in my picture uploads.



Other Ways You Can Help
SHARE THIS TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW! 

Send e-mails with this link. Tweet about it, post it to your facebook. Encourage dollar donations! IT WILL ALL ADD UP! Keep in mind, even if I only make $400, I will still be able to use $400 to pay for my car rental.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>""The Reality Engineers"" is about more than just a gang of geeks and their wild adventures through space and time, though . . . it's also about the struggle of the mentally ill to cope with and live with their disabilities; it's about finding one's place in society, and about fitting in . . . or being ""Mutant and Proud"" as the X-Men might say.  I myself suffer from bipolar disorder, OCD, and ADHD symptom<i>s, </i>and as a result, I have been forced to live on Social Security Disability for the past ten years.  But — that doesn't mean I can't sit at my desk and write my little butt off, fully-engaged with my fantasies!  These challenges (and others) mean that the first book took me ten long years to finish, although its sequels have only taken (amazingly) a couple of months each to crank out.  It's been a long uphill battle against this illness, but after 27 failed attempts at having a regular job, dozens of medications, and about 10 different doctors, I finally feel that things have reached a turning point for me.  The publication of <i>Volume 1, </i>along with the almost-completion of Volumes 2 and 3, is a huge deal for me . . . and have given me something to take heart and pride in . . . I have found my place in this world at long, long last; I guess ""storyteller"" isn't such a bad avocation, is it? </p>
<p>Anyway.  Enough of all that depressing crap.</p>
<p><i>The Reality Engineers: Volume 1 </i>is a grand, epic tale of love, loss, adventure, geekery, and dealing with the crippling effects of mental instability . . . Believe it or not, I think this book could actually <i>help</i> people who're having trouble with that — as well as who're trouble with fitting in with the mainstream — if that's not too grand a goal for a weird, offbeat sci-fi series to have.  I also think it makes some important philosophical statements about love, God, the universe, and all that good stuff.  I can't guarantee you'll like all that it says, but I can <i>almost</i> guarantee that you'll enjoy the roller-coaster ride that the book takes getting there.  Plus, my beta-readers agree:  It's pretty damned funny — <i>especially</i> if you're a geek and can get all the cool nerdy in-jokes and references . . . of which there are about a <i>million.</i>  (Well, okay; maybe not that many).  Be sure to check out the video linked above for more info, as well as for a synopsis of the first two books and a list of projected expenses involved with promoting them.</p>
<p>The next five books — if I write that many — are projected to take at least four years to complete, edit, and publish, and <i>the entire series</i> — save Book 1 — will need cover art and promotional swag created  And, I will also need promotional materials — including a few videos, and even full-fledged epic musical scores — and a clever (but costly)  marketing campaign, which is laid out in the video linked above.  Of course, all of this will have to be commissioned, paid for, and then distributed, which is where this Indiegogo campaign comes in. </p>
<p>Writing and publishing a series of book is easy, these days, if the muse is on your side (and believe me, sometimes she isn't).  It's promotion  and exposure — or the lack thereof— that either kills you, or gives birth to the next blockbuster bestseller.  And that's why I'm raising money for this project . . . the project being the writing, publishing, promotion, and distribution of this series through various channels and venues, and the means to achieve that, including an advertising budget, some kick-ass cover-art, and merchandise to act as swag during the books' promotion!</p>
<p>Book 1 is, as I said, already written and has been self-published through <a href=""http://Smashwords.com;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Smashwords.com</a> and <a href=""http://amazon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> (the Smashwords edition is offered FREE to anyone who wants it! — go download it now; see the link below!  And, the print edition is just $10.69 through Amazon — so why not grab both?).  Book 2 is currently finished, but is in dire need of cover art, as is the currently-unfinished Book 3,  which is nearly complete and will be finished  —and hopefully ready to publish — by the end of February, 2014.  When all three books are done, I plan to use the money raised here to start a massive online advertising blitz, and well as use some of it to produce further promotional material — such as t-shirts, posters, and free author copies for those who want them.</p>
<p>Then, it's on to the next four books in the series.  I'll probably need to raise additonal money when the time comes in order to design, distribute, and promote <i>those</i>, though some of the money from <i>this</i> Indiegogo campaign will undoubtedly go toward that goal as well.</p>
<p>Please note:  The Perks listed below (i.e., the swag packs) will only be available<b> <i>if and only if</i> </b>I manage to meet my funding goal of $6,000 within 60 days. If I <b><i>don't</i></b> manage to crack $6,000 within that time but I <b><i>do</i> </b>manage to raise <b><i>at least $1000</i></b>, then every person who donates at least $25 will, at the very least, receive both a free eBook edition of the first book as well as a signed physical copy of it, as an expression of my thanks.  I wish I could be more generous, but living on a fixed income and being a self-published author does, unfortunately, place limits on my resources!</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for?  Pitch in today, and help a struggling novelist promote his awesome-sauce vision of a world gone mad and a world that might be all the better for it!  C'mon, gang — together, we can help make ""The Reality Engineers"" a worldwide phenomenon!  Don't forget to check out the kick-ass video presentation above for more details!</p>

While there are countless yoga books out there, 21st Century Yoga: Culture, Politics, and Practice is the first to critically examine yoga as it actually exists in North America today. Written by experienced practitioners who are also teachers, therapists, activists, scholars, studio owners, and/or interfaith ministers, this unique set of essays provides a fresh take on the promise and pitfalls of contemporary yoga, exploring its relevance for issues including feminism, body image, psychology, activism, ethics, and spirituality.
 
The purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to independently publish the book. In keeping with our DIY collaborative ethos, we’re keeping the costs as low as we can without sacrificing quality and professionalism. Specifically, the money raised will be used to produce cover art and design, and secure assistance with typesetting and graphics. We plan to run this campaign through April, and publish 21st Century Yoga in September 2012.

Our Campaign
 
We’re hoping to raise $2,000 to cover our initial publishing costs; the bare-bones minimum needed to produce a quality work. Given that everyone’s been putting in many, many hours for free, we’re hoping to not only cover our costs, but ideally provide a small honorarium to our hard-working writers and editors too.
 
Any amount you can give will be sincerely appreciated. In gratitude for your support, we’re offering the following incentives: 

For $10, we’ll thank you as a supporter on our website, 21centuryyoga.com;
For $20, you’ll get a “thank you” and a copy of 21st Century Yoga;
For $40, you’ll get a “thank you,” a copy of 21st Century Yoga and a copy of Carol Horton’s new book, Yoga Ph.D.;

For $250, you’ll get a “thank you” both on the website and in the “Acknowledgements” section the book, along with copies of 21st Century Yoga and Yoga Ph.D. 

 

Our Intent

It’s safe to say that writing about yoga (both for this particular project and more generally) is a labor of love for all involved. We’re not working to craft a commercial blockbuster, and cash in on the multi-million dollar “yoga industry.” Instead, we’re writing to communicate ideas and experiences that have mattered to us – and that we hope will prove interesting, inspiring, or in some way useful to others. While there’s no single method or mission that unifies our work, we do share a sense that yoga matters – not simply to us as individuals, but as a valuable resource for our deeply troubled society, and the world that we live in today. 


Please Join Us! We’d Love Your Help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Melissa Harris.  I’m on a mission to offer any guidance and/or inspiration I can to assist folks in tuning in to and utilizing their own creative and intuitive abilities.  I want each of you to live life to the fullest which I believe includes being ""awake"" and tuned into Spirit as well as integrating our creative abilities into our lives in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>SO HOW AM I QUALIFIED TO DO THIS YOU ASK ???</p>
<p><strong>Artistic  Background</strong>:  I’m an internationally published author and artist as well as a psychic.  I hold a BFA in Painting from Syracuse University and an MFA in Painting from Queens College in New York.  I attended the Brooklyn Museum Art School on a Max Beckman Scholarship and received a Fulbright grant to study Painting in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>CREATRIX</strong> is my publishing line of notecards,  prints, and other gift items. My work can be found on CD covers, book covers, magazines, and calendars  in shops worldwide.  My “Anything is Possible” activation card deck won best in show at the International New Age Trade show in 2008. </p>
<p><strong>Psychic Background</strong>:  After a profound spiritual awakening in my late 20’s I began offering readings, which transformed into hands on healing.  I studied formally with Barbara Brennan at her Hands-on-Healing school.  I’ve been doing readings since that time and in more recent years found that I enjoy doing what I call “Spirit Essence Portraits” which are a combination of an intuitive reading, followed by a narrative watercolor painting of what I discover after tuning in. </p>
<p><strong>Teaching</strong></p>
<p>I teach workshops and classes that combine artistic technique with spirituality called “Painting Outside the Lines”.   I also offer workshops on developing and using your psychic awareness.</p>
<p><strong>The Book-</strong></p>
<p><strong>The book  is autobiographical in nature and also contains what I believe to be truths about some general traits of artists, as well as common ingredients of an artist’s as well as a psychic’s life.  I've also addressed questions that folks have asked me time and time again:</strong></p>
<p> Does being psychic have an effect on my artwork?</p>
<p>What’s it like to be psychic?</p>
<p>How is my world different?</p>
<p>How does an artist deal with rejection?</p>
<p> Here is a look at the juicy table of contents:</p>

<p><em>A Few Other Favorite Paintings </em></p>
<p><em>Yes, it may seem like $21.95 is a lot to pay for a book. probably seems like it is. But Painting Outside the Lines isn't just any book.  It has many paintings of mine you won't see anywhere else and lots of them.  It may never be published by a larger publisher and I'm not printing a huge number of copies. </em></p>
<p>You'll get a book. But it's a really special book. Only a few hundred other people will have it. And you'll also be helping us change how books get into the hands of readers.</p>
<p>And by the way, if someone tells you that $21.95 is too much to pay for a book, ask them how much they spent for the last concert they went to. Was it worth it? Absolutely. But a book is more than a 2-hour experience. Also, you get to keep it to read again. And if you want to, you can lend it to a friend to experience as well. These things all have value, (And if you really value that live, in-person experience, I have a donation level for that.)</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING</strong><em><br/></em></p>
<p>It's going to cost me almost $25,000 to publish the book including production, editing, design, galleys, postage, book tour expense, marketing and publicity.  I'm asking you to help cover a portion of these expenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Editorial, design and consultation services                               $10,000                              </li>
<li>Galleys for review and postage                                                $600                                    </li>
<li>Book tour expenses, marketing, and publicity            approx $5,000</li>
<li>Production - printing, binding, packing, shipping etc.            $9,000               </li>
<li>Payment of Indiegogo fees, and fulfillment of perks            UNKNOWN      <strong> </strong>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm sure this book will be helpful for YOU in some way.  Most everyone wants to be able to access and develop both their creativity as well as their intuitive abilities.  Even if you are not interested in either of these you will surely enjoy browsing through the collection of my artwork- much of it never seen before.  People have been enjoying a certain body of my artwork for years and this is an opportunity to see more- a body of very personal work - dear to my heart. So take the leap and donate now to receive your copy.  </p>
<p><strong>I've taken this text from the body of another author's campaign and it is right on.</strong></p>
<p>Let's take a moment for a lesson on how the traditional publishing industry works, because this might help explain why I'm undertaking this experiment. As a writer, I give my book to a publisher. In exchange, they give me a little money (the advance) as a good faith gesture. But that money isn't really a payday. It's a loan. Before I get any more money from my book, I have to pay that loan back in the form of a royalty I'm credited with for each copy of my book that sells. Only after I've paid back the advance do I get any more money.</p>
<p>So let's say a publisher really loves my book and decides to give me an advance of 10K for it. (I'm using round numbers to make this easy on my math-impaired brain.) The publisher prints a paperback and assigns a price of $15. If I have a good deal with them, my royalty rate is 8% of that $15 sale price, so for every copy of Painting Outside the Lines sold, I'm credited with $1.20. If my math is correct, this means I have to sell 8,334 copies of my book to pay back that 10K I was given as an advance. Only after that's done does the publisher owe me anything else.</p>
<p>And here's the thing--most writers never earn back that advance. 8,334 copies is a lot to sell. Most books sell far fewer copies than that. FAR fewer. So most authors are never going to see any money beyond what they were given for an advance. And advances are getting smaller and smaller as publishers get more and more reluctant to take chances on anything other than books with broad commercial appeal.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, of course, is that 92% of a book's sale price (on the paperback in my example) goes to the publisher. Now, they've taken all the risk and put up the money for editing, designing, printing, marketing, and distribution, so maybe this is fair. I'm not here to argue that. I'm just trying to explain why it is that the authors of the books you love to read so often seem to be in financial distress. </p>
<p>This is why I love things like Indiegogo. It gives writers (and all artists) a chance to take our work directly to readers. A huge percentage of what you donate will still go to covering the costs of editing, designing, and printing a book, or recording a CD. But because more of what our work earns is going to us, the artists you support will have a fighting chance of going on to make the next record, or write the next book, or create the next show. By removing the obstacles created by outdated ways of operating, we're creating new opportunities. And that's exciting.</p>
<p>Please--share my campaign with friends you think might be into it. Put it on your Facebook page. Send out one of those awful ""My friend is doing this cool thing!"" emails. You'll get karma points. And if we meet in person, a hug. Possibly cookies.</p>

CREATRIX is my publishing line of notecards,  prints, and other gift items. My work can be found on CD covers, book covers, magazines, and calendars  in shops worldwide.  My “Anything is Possible” activation card deck won best in show at the International New Age Trade show in 2008. 
Psychic Background:  After a profound spiritual awakening in my late 20’s I began offering readings, which transformed into hands on healing.  I studied formally with Barbara Brennan at her Hands-on-Healing school.  I’ve been doing readings since that time and in more recent years found that I enjoy doing what I call “Spirit Essence Portraits” which are a combination of an intuitive reading, followed by a narrative watercolor painting of what I discover after tuning in. 
Teaching
I teach workshops and classes that combine artistic technique with spirituality called “Painting Outside the Lines”.   I also offer workshops on developing and using your psychic awareness.
The Book-
The book  is autobiographical in nature and also contains what I believe to be truths about some general traits of artists, as well as common ingredients of an artist’s as well as a psychic’s life.  I've also addressed questions that folks have asked me time and time again:
 Does being psychic have an effect on my artwork?
What’s it like to be psychic?
How is my world different?
How does an artist deal with rejection?

A Few Other Favorite Paintings 
Yes, it may seem like $21.95 is a lot to pay for a book. probably seems like it is. But Painting Outside the Lines isn't just any book.  It has many paintings of mine you won't see anywhere else and lots of them.  It may never be published by a larger publisher and I'm not printing a huge number of copies. 
You'll get a book. But it's a really special book. Only a few hundred other people will have it. And you'll also be helping us change how books get into the hands of readers.
And by the way, if someone tells you that $21.95 is too much to pay for a book, ask them how much they spent for the last concert they went to. Was it worth it? Absolutely. But a book is more than a 2-hour experience. Also, you get to keep it to read again. And if you want to, you can lend it to a friend to experience as well. These things all have value, (And if you really value that live, in-person experience, I have a donation level for that.)
 
WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING
It's going to cost me almost $25,000 to publish the book including production, editing, design, galleys, postage, book tour expense, marketing and publicity.  I'm asking you to help cover a portion of these expenses.

Editorial, design and consultation services                               $10,000                              
Galleys for review and postage                                                $600                                    
Book tour expenses, marketing, and publicity            approx $5,000
Production - printing, binding, packing, shipping etc.            $9,000               
Payment of Indiegogo fees, and fulfillment of perks            UNKNOWN       




The Impact
I'm sure this book will be helpful for YOU in some way.  Most everyone wants to be able to access and develop both their creativity as well as their intuitive abilities.  Even if you are not interested in either of these you will surely enjoy browsing through the collection of my artwork- much of it never seen before.  People have been enjoying a certain body of my artwork for years and this is an opportunity to see more- a body of very personal work - dear to my heart. So take the leap and donate now to receive your copy.  
I've taken this text from the body of another author's campaign and it is right on.
Let's take a moment for a lesson on how the traditional publishing industry works, because this might help explain why I'm undertaking this experiment. As a writer, I give my book to a publisher. In exchange, they give me a little money (the advance) as a good faith gesture. But that money isn't really a payday. It's a loan. Before I get any more money from my book, I have to pay that loan back in the form of a royalty I'm credited with for each copy of my book that sells. Only after I've paid back the advance do I get any more money.
So let's say a publisher really loves my book and decides to give me an advance of 10K for it. (I'm using round numbers to make this easy on my math-impaired brain.) The publisher prints a paperback and assigns a price of $15. If I have a good deal with them, my royalty rate is 8% of that $15 sale price, so for every copy of Painting Outside the Lines sold, I'm credited with $1.20. If my math is correct, this means I have to sell 8,334 copies of my book to pay back that 10K I was given as an advance. Only after that's done does the publisher owe me anything else.
And here's the thing--most writers never earn back that advance. 8,334 copies is a lot to sell. Most books sell far fewer copies than that. FAR fewer. So most authors are never going to see any money beyond what they were given for an advance. And advances are getting smaller and smaller as publishers get more and more reluctant to take chances on anything other than books with broad commercial appeal.
Part of the problem, of course, is that 92% of a book's sale price (on the paperback in my example) goes to the publisher. Now, they've taken all the risk and put up the money for editing, designing, printing, marketing, and distribution, so maybe this is fair. I'm not here to argue that. I'm just trying to explain why it is that the authors of the books you love to read so often seem to be in financial distress. 
This is why I love things like Indiegogo. It gives writers (and all artists) a chance to take our work directly to readers. A huge percentage of what you donate will still go to covering the costs of editing, designing, and printing a book, or recording a CD. But because more of what our work earns is going to us, the artists you support will have a fighting chance of going on to make the next record, or write the next book, or create the next show. By removing the obstacles created by outdated ways of operating, we're creating new opportunities. And that's exciting.
Please--share my campaign with friends you think might be into it. Put it on your Facebook page. Send out one of those awful ""My friend is doing this cool thing!"" emails. You'll get karma points. And if we meet in person, a hug. Possibly cookies.

<p><u><strong>Story of My Book</strong></u></p>
<i>Unaware</i> is about injustice and equality and how everyone has something in common. <br/><br/>My name is L.C. Reid and I am the author of <i>Unaware</i>. I wrote this book because I want to call attention to how the media portrays minorities and how people need to start looking at their similarities, not their differences.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why prejudices and biases, while common in human nature, are harmful and think about why they exist. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore forgiveness, move past obstacles, and examine a life worth living. <br/><br/>My book is for young people who want to escape this world and fall into another place beyond the mundane routine of lock-down. In <i>Unaware</i>, my characters get transported into a new world where each learns more about themselves and each other. As they navigate their new environment and understand the cultural similarities it has with their own society, they explore all that this new place has to offer. In the end, they learn about their inner strengths as they begin to help the people around them. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you like fantasy stories with a contemporary twist.<br/><br/><i>Unaware</i> speaks to young adults and fantasy fanatics who want to grapple with racism and inequality in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Unaware</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ol>
<li>How can I find and spread tolerance in an unfair world?</li>
<li>Where did prejudices come from?</li>
<li>How does the media influence and enforce these prejudices?</li>
</ol>

Unaware is about injustice and equality and how everyone has something in common. My name is L.C. Reid and I am the author of Unaware. I wrote this book because I want to call attention to how the media portrays minorities and how people need to start looking at their similarities, not their differences.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover why prejudices and biases, while common in human nature, are harmful and think about why they exist. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore forgiveness, move past obstacles, and examine a life worth living. My book is for young people who want to escape this world and fall into another place beyond the mundane routine of lock-down. In Unaware, my characters get transported into a new world where each learns more about themselves and each other. As they navigate their new environment and understand the cultural similarities it has with their own society, they explore all that this new place has to offer. In the end, they learn about their inner strengths as they begin to help the people around them. You will love this book if you like fantasy stories with a contemporary twist.Unaware speaks to young adults and fantasy fanatics who want to grapple with racism and inequality in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Unaware inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How can I find and spread tolerance in an unfair world?
Where did prejudices come from?
How does the media influence and enforce these prejudices?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing injustice and equality will change us all for the better.

<h2>The Legend of the Dragonskinner</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Christopher Goodrum.  I am an actor, writer, composer, and director.  I was born to entertain and I have tried my hands in just about everything from stand-up to theme parks, and from theater to short films.  What I have always been passionate about was writing, from the time I wrote my first talent show skit at 13 years of age.  I love creating characters and developing stories. </p>
<p>This campaign is created for a short story I wrote in 2009 entitled ""The Legend of the Dragonskinner"", which is the first of three short stories.  It is a comedic tale about a man and his quest to find Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster, and dragons.  Ryan Henderson is not the brigthest man in the world or the bravest.  He is hapless, frequently wrong about a great many things, and always a step behind on the coolest trends.  But he stays true to his beliefs in the existence of mythical and legendary creatures in the same way children believe in Santa Claus.  The tale is filled with humor borderline on existentialism, suitable for teen readers, and pop culture references adults may enjoy.</p>
<p>This project was originally a side project for a couple of friends to read and enjoy.  Positive responses had led to encouragement in publishing it.</p>
<p>I am hoping ""The Legend of the Dragonskinner"" will springboard future works into the publishing world, either by being picked up by a publishing company, or continued self-publication.</p>
<p>And I need your help to make it a reality. </p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<h3>Set Goal</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is set at $1800 which will cover the production of the book as well as necessary costs to acquire copyright registration, and if enough is raised, registration with the Library of Congress.  You may contribute as much as you like, as often as you like.  A $3 contribution is as equally appreciative as a $20 contribution.  Any and all contributions will be released to me 10 days after the conclusion of the campaign period whether I make my goal or not.  However, the fee for Indiegogo services is higher for not making the set goal, so every little bit counts.  Publication of the book should be within 180 days from the time the book is put into production.</p>
<h3>Campaign Period and the Perks</h3>
<p>The campaign period will run for 45 days.</p>
<p>So...what's in it for you?  I have created some perks for certain contribution amounts.</p>
<p>- A contribution of $10  will get you mentioned on the Acknowledgement page.</p>
<p>- A contribution of $20 will get you a free soft cover copy of the book.</p>
<p>- And the highest contributor of starting from $25 will receive an autographed soft cover copy of the book.  If the goal is met, the perk will be upgraded to a free autographed hard cover copy.</p>
<h2>Off to the Races</h2>
<p>It is my hope that the goal is met and this campaign paves the way for future publications of ""The Dragonskinner Saga"" and other works.  Please, spread the word and suggests to family and friends to check out this campaign.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>I have been reading fantasy since before I even knew the word, and I started writing novels of my own at the age of twelve. The wild creative process that produces brand new worlds, races and cultures has always fascinated me, and I adore studying the hidden methods which create beautiful, moving literature. There was never really any doubt that I would study English. 

</p></span></span></span><p>Having completed the more formal Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, I have finally reached the point where I can start researching something entirely new. I am campaigning to fund my research into the creation of fantasy languages, using linguistic techniques to develop a new set of guidelines for writers.

</p>
<p>For J.R.R. Tolkien, Middle Earth was a place to showcase languages he had spent many years developing. However, most of us are not Tolkien, and would rather pour our time into telling our stories than developing entire languages of which the reader might only see a few words. On the other hand, having a few words, names for people or places, or even a few sentences can be enormously helpful in establishing a foreign world or culture. If done well, fantasy languages help immerse the reader in the writer’s new world. Of course, that’s only if they are done well. Mismatched words and overly convoluted spellings can only disrupt reader immersion.

</p>
<p>So, how do we get the positive effect without the hundreds of hours of language work? I believe that by studying the phonetic and morphological techniques used by writers of literary nonsense (such as Roald Dahl and Edward Lear), and breaking down the structure of existing successful fantasy languages, I can develop guidelines for authors who are creating their own, making the process of inventing coherent words and phrases much faster. 

</p>
<p>This linguistic “tool box” would be hugely valuable to fantasy writers for many years to come, but three years of dedicated research do not happen for free, and I need your help to make this happen. Dr Cathy Butler and Dr Jeanette Sakel at the University of the West of England have agreed to supervise the research, but I have to find the funds. Fellow fantasy lovers, this research will benefit all of us. Please help!
</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get

</h3>
<p>I am attempting to raise £16,000.

</p>
<p>This will cover three years of university fees at £4935 per year and the fees for using indiegogo. If the campaign goal is reached the indiegogo fees will be lower, but the difference would allow funding for valuable research trips. I intend to visit Great Missenden to study the Roald Dahl archives, and travel to the Bodleian Library in Oxford if possible to see Tolkien's papers. 

</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes at least £15 will get a complete digital copy of my thesis when the research is complete, sharing all my findings and guidelines for writers creating languages. 

</p>
<p>More generous contributors of £50 or more will also receive a physical copy to add to their home library as a reference text, ideal for scribbling in the margins, bookmarking with sticky notes and grabbing for a quick check while writing.

</p>
<p>Amazing people who give £100 or more will also receive a personal invitation to a lecture on the creation of fantasy languages, which will be held in Bristol once my research is complete.

</p>
<p>Those who go beyond £150 will receive digital and physical copies of the research, as well as a lecture invite, and will also receive a signed, personalised copy of my next fantasy novel as an additional thank you.

</p>
<p>If there are any further perks you would like to see here, don't hesitate to let me know. For example, perhaps if someone made a particularly fantastic contribution I could dedicate a book to them.

</p>
<p>Even if the goal is not reached, any funds would still be enormously helpful in paying some of the university fees to allow the research to go ahead.
</p>
<h3>The Impact

</h3>
<p>Although it is my PhD project, this research is not about me. The linguistic toolbox which I hope to develop would allow every budding fantasy writer to create coherent, etymologically sound languages without dedicating years of their lives to their development. </p>
<p>The research would be especially useful for those attempting fantasy works during NaNoWriMo – given the extremely tight schedule of writing 50,000 words in a month, who could possibly have time to develop languages without these new linguistic tools? With this research, gone will be the dodgy Latin-clones, the sneaky borrowings from Tolkien, the unpronounceable words littered with strange punctuation!</p>
<p>For readers and lovers of fantasy, this can only be a blessing. After all, who doesn’t find it weird and distracting when names and words make no sense in the context? If cousins Bob and T’zaarleth grew up in the same city, surely we shouldn’t struggle to make their names match?

</p>
<p>This is not the first time I have completed a large academic research project. My undergraduate dissertation was on “Realism, Mimesis and Social Critique in Modern Fantasy Fiction”. My MA dissertation was “Three Plays and Three Princes: Textual Variation in Shakespeare’s Hamlet.”

</p>
<p>I am also no stranger to the process of writing fantasy and building new worlds. Two of my books, The Red Mage and Darkness Visible, are already available on Amazon, and I have written several others. I have three major series in entirely new worlds in progress, so I am intimately familiar with the problems of inventing cultures and languages.

<p>Thank you!</p></span></span></div>","Short SummaryI have been reading fantasy since before I even knew the word, and I started writing novels of my own at the age of twelve. The wild creative process that produces brand new worlds, races and cultures has always fascinated me, and I adore studying the hidden methods which create beautiful, moving literature. There was never really any doubt that I would study English. 

Having completed the more formal Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, I have finally reached the point where I can start researching something entirely new. I am campaigning to fund my research into the creation of fantasy languages, using linguistic techniques to develop a new set of guidelines for writers.


For J.R.R. Tolkien, Middle Earth was a place to showcase languages he had spent many years developing. However, most of us are not Tolkien, and would rather pour our time into telling our stories than developing entire languages of which the reader might only see a few words. On the other hand, having a few words, names for people or places, or even a few sentences can be enormously helpful in establishing a foreign world or culture. If done well, fantasy languages help immerse the reader in the writer’s new world. Of course, that’s only if they are done well. Mismatched words and overly convoluted spellings can only disrupt reader immersion.


So, how do we get the positive effect without the hundreds of hours of language work? I believe that by studying the phonetic and morphological techniques used by writers of literary nonsense (such as Roald Dahl and Edward Lear), and breaking down the structure of existing successful fantasy languages, I can develop guidelines for authors who are creating their own, making the process of inventing coherent words and phrases much faster. 


This linguistic “tool box” would be hugely valuable to fantasy writers for many years to come, but three years of dedicated research do not happen for free, and I need your help to make this happen. Dr Cathy Butler and Dr Jeanette Sakel at the University of the West of England have agreed to supervise the research, but I have to find the funds. Fellow fantasy lovers, this research will benefit all of us. Please help!

What I Need & What You Get


I am attempting to raise £16,000.


This will cover three years of university fees at £4935 per year and the fees for using indiegogo. If the campaign goal is reached the indiegogo fees will be lower, but the difference would allow funding for valuable research trips. I intend to visit Great Missenden to study the Roald Dahl archives, and travel to the Bodleian Library in Oxford if possible to see Tolkien's papers. 


Everyone who contributes at least £15 will get a complete digital copy of my thesis when the research is complete, sharing all my findings and guidelines for writers creating languages. 


More generous contributors of £50 or more will also receive a physical copy to add to their home library as a reference text, ideal for scribbling in the margins, bookmarking with sticky notes and grabbing for a quick check while writing.


Amazing people who give £100 or more will also receive a personal invitation to a lecture on the creation of fantasy languages, which will be held in Bristol once my research is complete.


Those who go beyond £150 will receive digital and physical copies of the research, as well as a lecture invite, and will also receive a signed, personalised copy of my next fantasy novel as an additional thank you.


If there are any further perks you would like to see here, don't hesitate to let me know. For example, perhaps if someone made a particularly fantastic contribution I could dedicate a book to them.


Even if the goal is not reached, any funds would still be enormously helpful in paying some of the university fees to allow the research to go ahead.

The Impact


Although it is my PhD project, this research is not about me. The linguistic toolbox which I hope to develop would allow every budding fantasy writer to create coherent, etymologically sound languages without dedicating years of their lives to their development. 
The research would be especially useful for those attempting fantasy works during NaNoWriMo – given the extremely tight schedule of writing 50,000 words in a month, who could possibly have time to develop languages without these new linguistic tools? With this research, gone will be the dodgy Latin-clones, the sneaky borrowings from Tolkien, the unpronounceable words littered with strange punctuation!
For readers and lovers of fantasy, this can only be a blessing. After all, who doesn’t find it weird and distracting when names and words make no sense in the context? If cousins Bob and T’zaarleth grew up in the same city, surely we shouldn’t struggle to make their names match?


This is not the first time I have completed a large academic research project. My undergraduate dissertation was on “Realism, Mimesis and Social Critique in Modern Fantasy Fiction”. My MA dissertation was “Three Plays and Three Princes: Textual Variation in Shakespeare’s Hamlet.”


I am also no stranger to the process of writing fantasy and building new worlds. Two of my books, The Red Mage and Darkness Visible, are already available on Amazon, and I have written several others. I have three major series in entirely new worlds in progress, so I am intimately familiar with the problems of inventing cultures and languages.

<p>With Muslim mainstream views that homosexual relations were forbidden, is it possible for Muslim gays who had accepted themselves to be gay to find their partners? Or will it be just another struggle one after the other?</p>
<p>In June this year I had the opportunity to travel to Washington DC and Seattle where I met two Muslims convert; Daiyee Abdullah and Fatima Thompson. They have some radicals ideas about being Muslims and gays. For Daiyee it is possible for Muslim gays to get married.

<p>Hello! I am Julia Barcalow, the proud author of <i>That's Not My Momma's Milk!  </i></p>
<p>When my daughter was born a little over a year ago, we embarked on two major journeys together: exclusively breastfeeding and becoming vegan. My husband and I agreed that this was the best path for our family, and the more I researched and experienced life with my little one, the more motivated I became to write a book for children her age that supported and normalized the beauty of breastfeeding and the compassion of living a vegan life. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484590386/d2ocjanlrzf6c2lt69jv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When my daughter was born, it strengthened my veganism because it helped affirm the connection that all animals have with their babies. It truly hit home more than ever how the animal use industries separate moms from their babies without any thought, for the consumption and use of animal products.   </p>

<p>As an educator for over 15 years, a mother, natural parenting blogger, and vegan, I know that teaching our children kindness towards all starts on day one. This book shows the life-giving bond between mother and child through simple phrases and beautiful illustrations, created by the amazing Kayleigh Castle, that introduce the reader to different animals who are nursing their young.  </p>

<p>For our non-human animal friends, many of them, especially cows on dairy farms, have their young taken away from them within hours after their birth. On dairy farms, milk from non-human animals is viewed as a commodity for human consumption, and their babies are often not permitted to do the most natural thing, nurse from their mothers. Non-human animals bond with their young just as humans do, and their bodies are made to feed and sustain their babies, just as humans are. This book is meant to show that bond and to remind us that when it comes to non-human animals, That's Not My Momma's Milk!</p>

<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that babies be exclusively breastfeed from birth to six months, if possible. WHO recommends that breastfeeding should continue until a child is two years or older, while AAP recommends breastfeeding until the age of one. Despite these recommendations, in the United States, for example, the average length of breastfeeding is only three months. There is a desperate need in our society to normalize and support breastfeeding so that children can benefit from the many health benefits that breast milk has to offer.  </p>

</div></div>","About the author and this project!
Hello! I am Julia Barcalow, the proud author of That's Not My Momma's Milk!  
When my daughter was born a little over a year ago, we embarked on two major journeys together: exclusively breastfeeding and becoming vegan. My husband and I agreed that this was the best path for our family, and the more I researched and experienced life with my little one, the more motivated I became to write a book for children her age that supported and normalized the beauty of breastfeeding and the compassion of living a vegan life. 

When my daughter was born, it strengthened my veganism because it helped affirm the connection that all animals have with their babies. It truly hit home more than ever how the animal use industries separate moms from their babies without any thought, for the consumption and use of animal products.   
 
As an educator for over 15 years, a mother, natural parenting blogger, and vegan, I know that teaching our children kindness towards all starts on day one. This book shows the life-giving bond between mother and child through simple phrases and beautiful illustrations, created by the amazing Kayleigh Castle, that introduce the reader to different animals who are nursing their young.  

Your contribution to this campaign will help make our book a reality, and bring another important learning tool into the hands of the next generation of vegan parents.

Where does my money go?
Our goal is to raise $6,000 to complete this project. Your contribution will go directly to completing, printing, and distributing this book. For your contribution, you will receive a gift from us ranging from a post card to a personalized illustration of you and your child. You will also receive our deepest thanks and appreciation for making the book happen! Without your support, this book won't make it into the hands of parents who can use it.
Campaign Perks
We have a variety of perks that you can purchase in order to support this campaign. You can purchase a signed copy of the book, an eBook, or an activity packet that includes stickers and a downloadable coloring book. Our perks also include a tee shirt and a matching onesie, or a limited addition illustration print from the book. Also, you can receive an original personalized print of you and your child created by the illustrator, Kayleigh Castle.

<h3>My Goal:</h3>
<p>I am on a mission to raise $5,000 to cover production/editing for my upcoming coffee table book <strong>One Million Strong: Photos from the Million Man, World Day of Atonement, Million Women, Million Youth, Million Youth Movement, Million Family, and Millions More Movement Marches</strong>.</p>
<p>Perks for this campaign include prints on artist-grade metal, 2014 calendars, a downloadable e-book, &amp; an autographed coffee table book featuring more than 300 images from the marches.</p>
<p>Both <a href=""http://debwillisphoto.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Deborah Willis""><strong>Deborah Willis</strong> </a>(renowned photo curator, Macarthur Fellow and Chair of the New York University Photography Department) and <a href=""http://www.jamelshabazz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Jamel Shabazz</strong></a> (internationally acclaimed documentary photographer) have agreed to mentor me re: the book and the touring exhibit (detailed below).</p>
<p>Later this year, I will hand-design and self-publish a special edition of the coffee table book and an e-book to accompany the touring exhibit.</p>
<p>Your donations will be used to cover design, editing, and production costs. Any money raised in excess of the funding goal will be used for copy editing and additional production days on creating the coffee table book and the e-book.</p>
<p><em>If you donated to the previous campaign for the exhibit launch and would like to donate again, please know that the featured images for all the perks in this campaign are different than the last, so even if you donate at the same level, you'll get 2 distinct gifts in return.</em></p>
<h3>About the One Million Strong Coffee Table Book:</h3>
<p>The One Million Strong Photo Book (Fall 2013) features more than 300 images from the seven marches. The book also offers essays from noteworthy thought leaders, organizers, clergy, and artists. The text explores African American roots in social protest and the ways in which our forms of resistence have evolved over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>From quilts that contained hidden messages about escape plans to coded language and spirituals that described paths to freedom,</li>
<li>From civil disobedience to policing the police,</li>
<li>From slave revolts to self-defense,</li>
<li>From massive social protest to local political organizing,</li>
<li>From using our churches and mosques as meeting places for civil rights organizing to megachurches that have actively abandoned social justice issues,</li>
<li>From being the objectified subjects of traditional media to becoming the content producers of our own digital meda campaigns that advance authentic images of Black life as well as our political concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>About the One Million Strong Exhibit:</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/onemillionstrong"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""One Million Strong Facebook Page"">One Million Strong Traveling Photo Exhibit</a> captures the essence of the Million Man March (Washington, D.C.) and the 10 years of subsequent political/cultural gatherings it inspired: The World Day of Atonement in New York City (1996); The Million Women March in Philadelphia (1997); The Million Youth March in Harlem (1998); The Million Youth Movement in Atlanta (1998); The Million Family March in Washington, DC. (2000); and the Millions More Movement March in Washington, DC (2005).</p>
<p>The One Million Strong Exhibit consists of one hundred 16"" x 20"" photos, as well as essay text and video, and caters to community and educational groups. This the first full-showing of the collected work and it will become a traveling exhibit, available to colleges, community centers, and museums.</p>
<p>Installations of this work have previously been shown at the North Carolina Museum of History (Raleigh, NC), the International Center &amp; Civil Rights Museum (Greensboro, NC), Delta Fine Arts Center (Winston-Salem, NC), and Lucy Florence Coffee House (Los Angeles, CA).</p>

<p>Living With the Dead is a zombie apocalypse tale by Joshua Guess (that's me!). The story itself is a blog (which can be found at Livingwiththedead.net) and is a fully-realized fictional world with a story told in real time. LWtD began in March of 2010 and continues today. </p>
<p>The blog itself is collected into eBooks and sold on the Kindle store. The format generates some love, some hate, but tells the bones of the story as I want to tell it; survival day-by-day in a world overrun with the undead. </p>
<p><em>Victim Zero </em>is to be the first in a series of actual novels set in the LWtD universe. This volume will explore the origin of the zombie plague and give background on the world itself. There will be no lack of action, betrayal, death and survival. </p>
<p>While the collected editions of the blog and this book (and its sequels) will each stand alone (that is, you won't need to read both series to understand what is happening in either one), they will be woven together in some key ways. Characters in one series will appear in the other, for example. While each series can be read and enjoyed alone, together they will create a complex tapestry depicting an entire world at war with the dead.</p>
<p>To make that happen I have to give this project the time it deserves. For that, I need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><img alt=""perks and project goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1135.photobucket.com/albums/m636/Joshua_Guess/perks_zps8763bffa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>This project is being run through flexible funding. That means that even if we don't hit the $5,000 goal, I will still get your contribution and you will still get your perk. The only difference is that if we don't reach the goal I'll have to pay a higher fee when processing the money. </p>
<p>As to where the money goes, well...</p>
<p>I will be making this novel into a print book. Some of the money will go to a cover artist, some to a layout person to arrange the book, some to an excellent editor or two, and a good chunk will go toward the costs of fulfilling the perks. Whatever is left over will help pay the bills while I write this thing. </p>
<p>Here is a list of the perks. This list may expand if there is call to do so, and it WILL expand if we manage to get past the goal. Then we I will add stuff to every level of perks, and if the system will allow I'll even add new perks. Once past the $5,000 point I will begin announcing stretch goals to give each backer more bang for their buck.</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>$5-eBook Version</p>
<p>This perk nets you the eBook version of <em>Victim Zero </em>and your name in the front matter of the book. Every backer (unless they choose not to) will be credited in the book itself. At least, the electronic version. If fifty thousand people back the project I would A) have a heart attack of joy and B) not be able to realistically put that many names in a printed form.</p>
<p>$10-eBook Plus Short Story</p>
<p>Exactly what it says. You'll get the eBook version as well as an original short story set in the LWtD universe that will be exclusive to this campaign. Each digital copy will be sent in a variety of electronic formats to fit whatever ereader or program you use. </p>
<p>$25-eBook, Short Story, Print edition</p>
<p>This perk is self-explanatory. You get all of the above plus a print copy of the book. It will cost me money to have the book printed, so please add $5 for shipping. However! You may select this perk and add additional amounts for extra copies of the book <em>without </em>paying additional shipping. Add $8 per extra copy you would like to order. Oh, and you'll also get a nifty LWtD bookmark and bumber sticker, design to be revealed.</p>
<p>$50-Personalized Autograph</p>
<p>With this perk you get the eBook, short story, 2 (TWO) copies of the print edition as well as two bumber stickers and bookmarks. Shipping is included with this perk unless you choose to order additional copies, in which case add $8 per copy above the first two. I will autograph and inscribe each book however you like (you can tell me how in the survey email at the end of the campaign). </p>
<p>$75-Beta Read</p>
<p>This perk is identical to the $50 perk in all ways but one: you get to be a beta reader for <em>Victim Zero</em>. This is a chance for you to become a part of the process, read the book before its release, and make your mark on my world and characters. </p>
<p>$100-Fictional You</p>
<p>Identical to the $75 beta read perk, but you also get to name a character in the final book. This one is limited, but the name can be yours or one you make up. You get to choose gender and characteristics. The names have to be realistic, so if you choose ""Donkey McGingersnack"" I will veto that for something more reasonable.</p>
<p>-$500-Your Own Story</p>
<p>For $500 I will write a novella about you in the LWtD universe. You get all the perks up to the beta read (and obviously a character you name will be in this story). This novella will be created between the two of us and when I'm finished it will be <em>your </em>story. You will own the rights to it and be able to do with it whatever you please. Want to publish it yourself under your name? Cool. Want me to publish it and give the proceeds to charity? Fine and dandy. Whatever you want to do, we'll do. </p>

<p>I've been broke and living paycheck to paycheck. Hell, I still work a full-time job to keep the lights on. I understand if you want to help but don't have five bucks to spare. If that's the case, don't start digging into the change jar on my account. Instead you can spread the word on your social networks and in real life. Point people to this campaign and share the links for all you can. I'm just happy you've read this far, to be honest. I wrote this whole thing and even <em>I'm </em>a little tired of it. You're a trooper, and your support means the world to me. </p>
<p>That being said, by all means back the project with money if you can afford it. If you're feeling super-generous you can actually back the project with a larger amount than your perk requires or even put money in the pot without requesting a perk. I do that sometimes for campaigns I really like, but I'm of course happy to have you get rewards for your hard-earned benjamins.</p>

PROJECT
 
An ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL & WORK DESIGN based on the Human Body's principles showing the Interactions to Best Performance in Organizations.The Book will also include a series of charts showing the different interactions based on the principles of Coordination, Connection, Collaboration in a Company Body Model. 
 
HOW COULD A COMPANY BODY BE IF IT REPLICATED A HUMAN BODY'S SYSTEMIC PRINCIPLES & COORDINATION?

LEVERAGE ON PARTS - VALUE TO THE WHOLE


What is one of the most complex organized systems in nature? We all know that: the Human Body! And its working principles?

Coordination: the process where a human body’s neurons and limbs work together to produce movement and also balance and reaction. It is a highly complicated process that most people do effortlessly, like tying their own shoes. On the contrary, it is a highly complicated process that most organizations do with a big effort. 
Connection: a human body is made of many cells, organized into sheets of tissue, then in structures called organs composing the organ systems. And each system in the Body serves to assist other systems for the good of the organism. Likewise organizations are formed by people, gathered in layers of expertise, organized in structures called units or divisions or whatsoever composing what we call a structured Company. And each department in the company should serve to assist other departments for the good of the organization.
Collaboration: how many hearts or livers does a human body need to work better? Or can you imagine the scenario if heart and lungs didn't collaborate?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a poet and writer. My poetry has appeared, or is forthcoming, in <em>Blackbird</em> and <em>The Innisfree Poetry Journal.</em> My fiction was anthologized in <em>Gumbo: An Anthology of African American Writing </em>and has appeared in several journals and magazines, including<em> Carve Magazine, African Voices, The Source, Bronx Biannual </em>and<em> 64 magazine. </em>In 2003, WBEZ 91.5 FM, Chicago’s NPR affiliate, broadcast a dramatic reading of one of my stories as part of its <em>Stories on Stage</em> series. I have also written articles for a wide array of publications, including <em>AlterNet, Guernica, </em><em>The Source</em> and <em>Black Issues Book Review.</em></p>
<p>Recently, I won the 2012-2013 Eva Jane Romaine Coombe Writer’s Residency at The Seven Hills School, a pre-K — 12 private school in Cincinnati, Ohio. The yearlong residency is a great opportunity — it will give me the time I need to complete my first book of poems. The residency comes with a stipend and free housing and utilities. However, the stipend is modest; while it will cover my living expenses, it <em>will not</em> cover my additional expenses. This is why I am asking for your donation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let me give you a detailed picture of what the residency stipend will not cover. It will not cover the <strong>$2400</strong> expense of having established poet and experienced teacher Matthew Lippman critique every poem that will go into the book (Lippman’s critique of my work in the last year or so helped me win the residency). Nor will the stipend cover relocation expenses. I will have to move from New York to Cincinnati before the 2012-2013 school year starts and will have to move again in July 2013, when the residency ends. Moving to Cincinnati will cost approximately <strong>$1750</strong>. Moving from Cincinnati in July 2013 will likely cost much more since — depending on employment, fellowship and graduate-school opportunities — I might not be able to return to New York. If I end up entering a PhD in Creative Writing program next fall, I might have to move as far away as Utah, LA or even Hawaii (Most of these programs are in the Midwest, West and Southwest). Moving to Utah would cost approximately <strong>$3000</strong>.</p>
<p>There are other expenses the stipend will not cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$2300: </strong>The cost of the four-week artist’s residency I won at the Vermont Studio Center. The residency will give me the time, space and inspiring environment I need to get a lot of writing done. The full cost of the residency is $3950, but the $1050 Artist’s Grant I won and the $600 Work Exchange Financial Aid Award I received brings the cost down to $2300. My residency will run from March 3 to March 29, 2013. (This month-long residency should not be confused with the yearlong Eva Jane Romaine Coombe Writer’s Residency I mentioned in paragraph 2.)</li>
<li>
<strong>$1000:</strong> The fee for taking the GRE and the fees involved in applying to PhD in Creative Writing programs (Because the most selective programs have a very low acceptance rate [from 2% to 6%], I’ll apply to 12 programs).</li>
<li>
<strong>$420:</strong> The cost of applying for fellowships, book awards (that grant book publication) and other writing awards.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1675:</strong> The cost of attending the Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs (AWP) conference in Boston in March 2013 (The cost includes the registration fee, airfare, hotel accommodations, ground transportation and food). AWP is one of America’s largest and most influential literary communities. Attending the conference is vital to my success as a poet and writer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expenses I just listed come to a total of <strong>$12,545</strong>. My campaign goal is <strong>$3000</strong>, not nearly enough to fully cover my expenses. If I were to raise only that amount, I would have to exhaust my savings and borrow money. And yet $3000 would help a great deal. That said, it would be ideal if I received much more.</p>

Local author, Dave Burns, brought life to the Ottawa Writer’s Guild when he began organizing a group in March of this year that met twice a month at the Ottawa Library. The group inspires each other, bounces ideas off one another and is led by Dave Burns in writing instruction. The group wanted to publish their work online so they formed a guild and created a website blog. We put up a sign up sheet during summer reading for library patrons interested in learning to write or attending specific writing instruction or workshops, almost immediately 10 patrons signed up and each month the number doubles in interest. The response was so strong that Burns started up a second group that meets on Wednesdays at the Carnegie Cultural Center in Ottawa.  The Saturday Library group continues to meet twice a week and has an average of 8-10 participants each time.<br/><br/>Dave Burns has plans to increase his writing workshops and lessons and spread the love of writing more in the community.

I decided to take it because I am interested in pursuing a career that involves writing when I grow up. His class was even better than I expected.  It taught me a lot; especially that it's okay to make mistakes when you write. That was very important for me and took me a little while to grasp. I am very thankful that I took this class.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most important thing that Dave's class allowed me to do was to be able to have someone look at my writing. Before it had all been very private because I didn't want anyone judging it. Dave helped me through that and for that I am very grateful. Dave's writing class was super helpful. It encouraged me to continue thinking about a career with writing. I would recommend it to anyone who just loves to write.<br/><br/>Caroline Webber, age 12<br/><br/><br/><em>*70% of class/workshop cost goes to pay the instructor (myself), and 30% goes to the Ottawa Community Arts Council.</em><br/><br/><br/><strong>c) Self-Publishing Consultant</strong><br/><br/>In addition to staring both The Ottawa Writers' Guild and The Creative Writing Program, I have assisted 2 local authors in getting their work published.  I feel very strongly that everyone has a story to tell and should have the right to tell it, and I'm very proud of my involvement in helping make their dreams come true.  <br/><br/><em>Testimonial</em><br/><br/>Dave Burns was tremendously helpful and patient with me as I explored the world of self-publishing.

<p><br/><br/></p></div>","A Brief Intro: The A, B, C'sHi, I'm Dave Burns.  I'm an Indie author located in Ottawa, KS (yeah - there's an Ottawa in Kansas).  I've always had a passion for writing, but have only been seriously writing since October of '09.  Since that time, I've got a few books under my belt (uncarvedbooks.com and amazon.com/author/daveburns).  a) The Ottawa Writers' GuildAfter I finished my first book (The Movement: A Children's Story for Grown-ups), I began looking around for creative writing groups that I could join to hone my craft.  Surprisingly, I really couldn't find any - not locally, anyway.  So I approached the Ottawa Library, and low and behold, several people had previously expressed interest.  There was even a file accumulated!  So I began contacting these individuals with the help of the Library Staff, and we began meeting March of '12.  To date, The Ottawa Writers' Guild has over 20 members and 2 active groups.  The original group meets on the 1st and 3rd Saturdays of each month at the Library from 9am-Noon.  We originally met for 2 hours, but we had to up the time due to the increase of participants who wanted to share their work.  A good problem to have!  Because of the large group size, another was created.  It meets at the Ottawa Community Arts Council (also called the Carnegie Cultural Center) twice a month, usually on Wednesday mornings (schedule varies due to availability).  In an attempt to help bring about exposure for this group and other local authors/artists, I founded/created Uncarved: The Literature and Arts Magazine.  It's a compilation magazine of artistic mediums (written word, visual art, music, etc).  To date, we have 1 publication, which contained 15 different contributors with a total of 24 entries.  We hope to add more volumes as time goes on.TestimonialThe Ottawa community has benefited greatly from the creation of the Ottawa Writers' Guild which a group of writers, poets and members who love literary works and the written word. Local author, Dave Burns, brought life to the Ottawa Writer’s Guild when he began organizing a group in March of this year that met twice a month at the Ottawa Library. The group inspires each other, bounces ideas off one another and is led by Dave Burns in writing instruction. The group wanted to publish their work online so they formed a guild and created a website blog. We put up a sign up sheet during summer reading for library patrons interested in learning to write or attending specific writing instruction or workshops, almost immediately 10 patrons signed up and each month the number doubles in interest. The response was so strong that Burns started up a second group that meets on Wednesdays at the Carnegie Cultural Center in Ottawa.  The Saturday Library group continues to meet twice a week and has an average of 8-10 participants each time.Dave Burns has plans to increase his writing workshops and lessons and spread the love of writing more in the community. He wishes to lead more classes based in the Carnegie Cultural Center building, because of a lack of available funding the Ottawa Library wasn’t able to accommodate Burns in comprehensive writing instruction even though we realize there is a need and a hunger for this type of workshop in our community. We feel strongly that Burns’ writing classes are beneficial and we know they are well attended. His program would be a good thing to invest in it reaches many individuals in the community that may not be able to afford college writing classes or to travel far to neighboring cities.Sincerely,Lisa Slavin, Adult Programming at the Ottawa Libraryb) The Creative Writing ProgramI began putting the call out for interest in Creative Writing Classes and Workshops in May of '12 with the help of the Ottawa Library.  To date, over 50 people have signed up expressing interest.  And thanks to our blog (www.theottawawritersguild.wordpress.com) and my website (www.uncarvedbooks.com), we even have some individuals from Ottawa, Canada interested in classes.  Yet, another advantage of living in Ottawa, Kansas edition!So far, we have had 4 different classes/workshops and 24 enrolled students.  Not bad for a start up, huh?  I have been researching and creating the curriculum, as well as taking suggestions for future classes from those enrolled.  As it stands, each 4-week class costs $40, and each 2-week workshop costs $30*. Each class runs approximately 2 hours, so a 4-week class has roughly 8 hours of instruction (as an example).  Here's a list of classes/workshops that have been offered:

""The Nuts and Bolts of Creative Writing"" - 4-week Class
""The Art of Creative Writing"" - 4-week Class
""The Ins and outs of Self-Publishing"" - 2-week Workshop

Thanks in large part to our Northern Canadian Friends, we have even begun to research online classes, and hope to get that started in the near future.  TestimonialsI took one of Dave's writing classes in November.

<p>We’re tired of hearing that literature is dead. We are so tired, in fact, we started a literary zine called We Still Like. Why would anyone start such an endeavor in this day and age? Simple: We Still Like Books!</p>
<p>We still believe in the power of language and the importance of sincerity. We still believe that literature is as vital as oxygen, that it keeps us human and lets us forge real connections. We are tired of cowering behind a shield of irony and taking ourselves oh-so-seriously because we’re told that’s what writers are supposed to do. Creation and connection shouldn’t have to be so hard. We need your help to save literature.</p>
<p>We still like saying something true, creating sincere work distinct from the tides of commerce. But when language has been cheapened and sentiment discredited, sincerity becomes a radical concept. Speaking in a bright, clear voice becomes an act of revolution.</p>
<p>We still see this as literature’s purpose. It’s been our mantra ever since we published the first issue of We Still Like in a handmade limited edition of 100 — not too fussed over, not too perfect, but printed, stacked, bound, loved and sent out into the tangible world. And the response has been overwhelming. We’ve already sold out of the first issue and begun to cultivate a community passionate about contributing to the cause by hosting readings and distributing We Still Like at local bookshops.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve proven it can be done, we want to keep doing it. We’re poised to release our second issue: We Still Like Gravity, a collection of investigations into all that is weighty and meaningful, all that is too big and too small to take, all that pulls us together and all that makes us light. It features a special screenprinted cover and work by some of our very favorite writers. You can see what we’ve been up to and read selections from We Still Like at <a href=""http://WeStillLike.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://WeStillLike.blogspot.com/</a>.</p>
<p>We see We Still Like as the bridge between our authors and an audience who is likewise tired of suffering the status quo, who wants more than hollow work overhyped, who wants access to the meaningful creations of hard-working artists who so often go undervalued.</p>
<p>Our donors are the trestles of this bridge. We Still Like has no external funding, but instead relies directly on you for its survival — you finding it interesting, inspiring and, most importantly, valuable enough to keep it alive and growing.

We’re tired of hearing that literature is dead. We are so tired, in fact, we started a literary zine called We Still Like. Why would anyone start such an endeavor in this day and age? Simple: We Still Like Books!
We still believe in the power of language and the importance of sincerity. We still believe that literature is as vital as oxygen, that it keeps us human and lets us forge real connections. We are tired of cowering behind a shield of irony and taking ourselves oh-so-seriously because we’re told that’s what writers are supposed to do. Creation and connection shouldn’t have to be so hard. We need your help to save literature.
We still like saying something true, creating sincere work distinct from the tides of commerce. But when language has been cheapened and sentiment discredited, sincerity becomes a radical concept. Speaking in a bright, clear voice becomes an act of revolution.
We still see this as literature’s purpose. It’s been our mantra ever since we published the first issue of We Still Like in a handmade limited edition of 100 — not too fussed over, not too perfect, but printed, stacked, bound, loved and sent out into the tangible world. And the response has been overwhelming. We’ve already sold out of the first issue and begun to cultivate a community passionate about contributing to the cause by hosting readings and distributing We Still Like at local bookshops.
Now that we’ve proven it can be done, we want to keep doing it. We’re poised to release our second issue: We Still Like Gravity, a collection of investigations into all that is weighty and meaningful, all that is too big and too small to take, all that pulls us together and all that makes us light. It features a special screenprinted cover and work by some of our very favorite writers. You can see what we’ve been up to and read selections from We Still Like at http://WeStillLike.blogspot.com/.
We see We Still Like as the bridge between our authors and an audience who is likewise tired of suffering the status quo, who wants more than hollow work overhyped, who wants access to the meaningful creations of hard-working artists who so often go undervalued.
Our donors are the trestles of this bridge. We Still Like has no external funding, but instead relies directly on you for its survival — you finding it interesting, inspiring and, most importantly, valuable enough to keep it alive and growing. Initial sales and donations defrayed some of the printing costs of the first issue. With the help of new readers and your continued support, we are excited to make each successive issue more ambitious and sustainable.

<h3>Help Free Sylvia Plath - We Want to Publish Her Debut Collection in Germany</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Sylvia Plath's work has been translated in many languages. In Germany - one of the biggest bookmarkets in Europe - the only poetry book available by her is ""Ariel"" and - oddly enough - a selection of ""Love Poems"". </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We want to publish the exceptional translation of her debut collection ""The Colossus and Other Poems"" translated by one of Germany's acclaimed young poets Judith Zander. We sincerely believe that the debut collection by one of the most influential American poets of her generation should be available to German readers in a bilingual edition. The German publisher of ""Ariel"" and ""The Bell Jar"" seems to be blocking all rights to the book by an option right they don't use - needless to say that they have never published an edition of ""The Colossus"" and it seems unclear what their plans for the future are. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are a small Independent Publisher called luxbooks focusing on American poetry in bilingual editions. Among our authors are John Ashbery, Rae Armantrout, Mary Jo Bang, Hart Crane, H.D., Timothy Donnelly, Forrest Gander, Peter Gizzi, Ben Lerner, Sarah Manguso, George Oppen, D. A. Powell and John Updike. The translations are normally done by acclaimed German poets. Our books are regularly reviewed in national newspapers, radio and television. The leading Swiss Newspaper NZZ called us the ""currently most influential Independent Poetry publisher in Germany"". We can't however compete with a big publishing house on our own. We figure that we have to raise at least 6.000$ to be able to make a competitive offer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Luxbooks is being run by us: Annette KÃ¼hn (*1981) &amp; Christian Lux (*1978), two poetry loving Independent publishers from Wiesbaden.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">20 years ago, a shy autistic man who had never written more then a shopping list and had failed English at school, met a literary agent. She was so impressed with his turn of phrase and beautiful storytelling style that she asked him to write her 8 chapters of a novel.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not realising it was ‘supposed’ to be hard to write a book, he did just that – handing those first chapters over to her only three weeks later…</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That man was Caiseal Mór. Within three weeks of publication his first novel ‘The Circle and the Cross’ was a best seller. Caiseal was the first Australian author to have their first book signed up to a deal on an unfinished manuscript.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the ensuing years Caiseal published another 16 books, and also 14 music CDs.<span style="""">  </span>He has travelled and had many adventures, but now on the eve of the 20th anniversary of his first book he has decided it's time to do something to honour those stories that have touched so many people over the years.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We are going to re-release the books as ebooks. But not only that, Caiseal plans to expand them, to re-introduce the more magical elements the editors of the conservative publishing houses made him take out in the original printed versions. For the first time you will get to see and read Caiseal’s novels as he intended them to be.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This campaign is to raise the funds to convert the books (which the original word documents have been lost) into digital form from hard copy. This indiegogo campaign is for the first three books (the Wanderers Trilogy) Being: The Circle and the Cross; The Song of the Earth; The Water of Life.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If this project proves successful we will be launching future campaigns with the vision of eventually having all 15 books of his (those which are not currently available as ebooks) to be also expanded and re-released as ebooks.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Getting excited with the potential of expanded versions of these three books, we have also decided to print a limited edition, signed box set of the trilogy for those bibliophiles out there who need to have beautiful hard copies of their most loved stories to fondle and admire. So the funds raised in this campaign will also pay for the printing of those books.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Caiseal often receives requests for digital versions of his novels, so we hope many people will be delighted to support this project - a project quite a lot of you have suggested is long overdue.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> Caiseal will also create all new artwork for the covers.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For those of you who have yet to read any of Caiseal’s novels, please scroll down to the bottom of this window to enjoy the prologue of ‘The Circle and the Cross’ and please help us by sharing this campaign whereever you can.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank-you,</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Circle and the Cross</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Caiseal Mór</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Prologue:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Hear the wind wailing down a chimney on the darkest night of winter. Sit at the fire warming flesh that has blued in icy air. Rest eyes that ache, feet that are weary. Listen to the homely sounds of neighbours preparing meals in cottages nearby.<span style="""">       </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Imagine, if you will, a dry-stone dwelling that is empty save for the silent long dead souls who keep watch over the house. Across a cobbled courtyard spring water struggles up through stone pipes into a granite trough worn smooth in the great passage of years once the first Gaels set in there.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Snow lies heavy on thatch. Ice hugs doorsteps. Golden lamplight escapes from cracks in wooden window shutters. Sweet peat smoke scents a chill breeze that enfolds the tiny settlement, gathering sounds and lifting them into the night.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">An old song-maker, chanting in the style of her ancestors, raises a keening cry lamenting the long absence of summer. The hills around hear the notes and pass them down the valley, adding the muffled tunes of their kind. They remember other winters and other races who have long since left this place to pass eternity in Tir-Nan-Og, the land of the everliving.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Here, amongst these folk who called themselves the Feni, was I born and there passed my first years on this Earth.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">A traveller chanced by that place some ten years ago. He told me what he saw. The houses are now ruined shells. The timber is rotted and the hearthstones lie cold. The people are all gone. They live only in my memory.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">I have not, in all this time since, returned to the valley of my ancestors. Now I am too old and the journey is too dangerous. I can only dream that I am home and hope that my yearning heart will be satisfied one day.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Oh, but when I dream it is not always of winter’s bite. I dream also of the clear air at summertime. I dream of the ordinary daily tasks that everyone in the clan hold had duty to share.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">And there is one scene that unfolds itself in sleep-travel time and again. A child is dutifully chasing the goats at sunset to bring them in to the safety of their enclosure. He has yellow hair and a soft, easy laugh. He is slender and his eyes are deep-set and dark-ringed. He knows each goat by name and one or two he addresses as equals. From them he has learned his first lessons in respect.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">His feet follow a hoof-beaten dirt track down the side of a small grass-covered knoll toward the round hillfort that his people call the dun. The goats march before him, breaking into a trot at the sight of their home, knowing the shelter and water await them there.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">The boy does not notice the farmers or labourers of even the people of his own clan working within the low walls. He does not smell the supper boiling at the cooking fire. He cannot hear the greetings of his friends or the gentle rebukes of his mother.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">His head is full of the words of the storytellers.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">In private delight, he brings to mind every expression, every gesture that he has witnessed, striving to recall all he can of the old tales. He is truly a dreamer. He would leave his home tomorrow now, if he could, to be a poet.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">That young dreamer still lives strong in me.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">But surely I am speaking to you of some things a little too soon. There will be time enough for that part of the story later.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">This tale really begins at the far end of the same valley where a trickling stream narrowed before pouring into a pool. At that place, a roughly-built rock ford reached the sand on the other side of the water. And there, almost smothered by blackthorn bushes, lay the beginnings of a road.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">This was no ordinary road. To me and my clan, this was <em style="""">the</em> Road.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">It was our link to the world beyond. It was our lifeline, our protector, our procurer of rare goods. We revered the Road for, you see, we lived at one of those rare places where it came to an end.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">In these times there are few people living who could tell you more than rumours whispered and half-truths of the origins and history of the Road. I alone remain of those who ever knew the larger part of the tale.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: 36.0pt;"">Beyond our valley, towns and cities and palaces and empires erupted like springtime seedlings from the edges of the Road. The taverns groaned full of travellers who wandered it; the markets hummed as its side just as the hives of worker bees buzzed in their all-consuming labour.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>This Road brought all together: the farmer, the soldier, the journeyman, the merchant, the priest, the kind, the lowly beggar. The Road served all, yet mastered each, for it drew travellers then as I imagine it draws folk still, spurring their curiosity to set out for the lands that lie beyond the well-worn comfort of familiarity.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>Would that you ever find yourself walking the Road, trudging without purpose, seeking some journey’s end, I give you this warning. The Road is a living being. She is an enchantress and She has a long reach.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>She may at her whim lead you to the edge of the world, into the lands of light. Aye, and She could as well set you on the paths that reach only into the darkest corners of this Earth.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>The Road holds within Her an unseen current that will drag you to Her holiest shrines. There She will reveal her mighty triumphs, each greater than the last, each a song of Her splendour. In that moment when you are caught up by the travel-trance, you will become lost to all your fellow beings, though you may well be surrounded by them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>For my part, there have been times, many times, when the will to continue on the long Road almost deserted me. There came a day, once, when my body lay battered, exhausted and near-dead and my soul yearned for the quiet respite of the lands beyond life. In all that suffering my only constant companion was the Road. It was She alone who could carry me forward to a safe-haven or to disaster, as was Her whim.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>These days I rest often and travel little. I have a room in a town, in a country far from my homeland. In this time I have no leisure to journey, but the spirit of the Road still returns to taunt me. She fills my mind with part-recollected, part-imagined scenes from my wanderings, dangling before me enticing visions of what might have been or what yet may be.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>Last night She came to me in my room as I sat strumming the harp before the fire.

She was so impressed with his turn of phrase and beautiful storytelling style that she asked him to write her 8 chapters of a novel.
Not realising it was ‘supposed’ to be hard to write a book, he did just that – handing those first chapters over to her only three weeks later…
 
That man was Caiseal Mór. Within three weeks of publication his first novel ‘The Circle and the Cross’ was a best seller. Caiseal was the first Australian author to have their first book signed up to a deal on an unfinished manuscript.
 
In the ensuing years Caiseal published another 16 books, and also 14 music CDs.  He has travelled and had many adventures, but now on the eve of the 20th anniversary of his first book he has decided it's time to do something to honour those stories that have touched so many people over the years.
We are going to re-release the books as ebooks. But not only that, Caiseal plans to expand them, to re-introduce the more magical elements the editors of the conservative publishing houses made him take out in the original printed versions. For the first time you will get to see and read Caiseal’s novels as he intended them to be.
This campaign is to raise the funds to convert the books (which the original word documents have been lost) into digital form from hard copy. This indiegogo campaign is for the first three books (the Wanderers Trilogy) Being: The Circle and the Cross; The Song of the Earth; The Water of Life.
If this project proves successful we will be launching future campaigns with the vision of eventually having all 15 books of his (those which are not currently available as ebooks) to be also expanded and re-released as ebooks.
Getting excited with the potential of expanded versions of these three books, we have also decided to print a limited edition, signed box set of the trilogy for those bibliophiles out there who need to have beautiful hard copies of their most loved stories to fondle and admire. So the funds raised in this campaign will also pay for the printing of those books.
 
Caiseal often receives requests for digital versions of his novels, so we hope many people will be delighted to support this project - a project quite a lot of you have suggested is long overdue.
 Caiseal will also create all new artwork for the covers.
For those of you who have yet to read any of Caiseal’s novels, please scroll down to the bottom of this window to enjoy the prologue of ‘The Circle and the Cross’ and please help us by sharing this campaign whereever you can.
Thank-you,
Helen Wells (Caiseal’s manager and life partner)

The Circle and the Cross
Caiseal Mór
Prologue:
 
 
Hear the wind wailing down a chimney on the darkest night of winter. Sit at the fire warming flesh that has blued in icy air. Rest eyes that ache, feet that are weary. Listen to the homely sounds of neighbours preparing meals in cottages nearby.       
Imagine, if you will, a dry-stone dwelling that is empty save for the silent long dead souls who keep watch over the house. Across a cobbled courtyard spring water struggles up through stone pipes into a granite trough worn smooth in the great passage of years once the first Gaels set in there.
Snow lies heavy on thatch. Ice hugs doorsteps. Golden lamplight escapes from cracks in wooden window shutters. Sweet peat smoke scents a chill breeze that enfolds the tiny settlement, gathering sounds and lifting them into the night.
An old song-maker, chanting in the style of her ancestors, raises a keening cry lamenting the long absence of summer. The hills around hear the notes and pass them down the valley, adding the muffled tunes of their kind. They remember other winters and other races who have long since left this place to pass eternity in Tir-Nan-Og, the land of the everliving.
Here, amongst these folk who called themselves the Feni, was I born and there passed my first years on this Earth.
A traveller chanced by that place some ten years ago. He told me what he saw. The houses are now ruined shells. The timber is rotted and the hearthstones lie cold. The people are all gone. They live only in my memory.
I have not, in all this time since, returned to the valley of my ancestors. Now I am too old and the journey is too dangerous. I can only dream that I am home and hope that my yearning heart will be satisfied one day.
Oh, but when I dream it is not always of winter’s bite. I dream also of the clear air at summertime. I dream of the ordinary daily tasks that everyone in the clan hold had duty to share.
And there is one scene that unfolds itself in sleep-travel time and again. A child is dutifully chasing the goats at sunset to bring them in to the safety of their enclosure. He has yellow hair and a soft, easy laugh. He is slender and his eyes are deep-set and dark-ringed. He knows each goat by name and one or two he addresses as equals. From them he has learned his first lessons in respect.
His feet follow a hoof-beaten dirt track down the side of a small grass-covered knoll toward the round hillfort that his people call the dun. The goats march before him, breaking into a trot at the sight of their home, knowing the shelter and water await them there.
The boy does not notice the farmers or labourers of even the people of his own clan working within the low walls. He does not smell the supper boiling at the cooking fire. He cannot hear the greetings of his friends or the gentle rebukes of his mother.
His head is full of the words of the storytellers.
In private delight, he brings to mind every expression, every gesture that he has witnessed, striving to recall all he can of the old tales. He is truly a dreamer. He would leave his home tomorrow now, if he could, to be a poet.
That young dreamer still lives strong in me.
But surely I am speaking to you of some things a little too soon. There will be time enough for that part of the story later.
This tale really begins at the far end of the same valley where a trickling stream narrowed before pouring into a pool. At that place, a roughly-built rock ford reached the sand on the other side of the water. And there, almost smothered by blackthorn bushes, lay the beginnings of a road.
This was no ordinary road. To me and my clan, this was the Road.
It was our link to the world beyond. It was our lifeline, our protector, our procurer of rare goods. We revered the Road for, you see, we lived at one of those rare places where it came to an end.
In these times there are few people living who could tell you more than rumours whispered and half-truths of the origins and history of the Road. I alone remain of those who ever knew the larger part of the tale.
Beyond our valley, towns and cities and palaces and empires erupted like springtime seedlings from the edges of the Road. The taverns groaned full of travellers who wandered it; the markets hummed as its side just as the hives of worker bees buzzed in their all-consuming labour.
            This Road brought all together: the farmer, the soldier, the journeyman, the merchant, the priest, the kind, the lowly beggar. The Road served all, yet mastered each, for it drew travellers then as I imagine it draws folk still, spurring their curiosity to set out for the lands that lie beyond the well-worn comfort of familiarity.
            Would that you ever find yourself walking the Road, trudging without purpose, seeking some journey’s end, I give you this warning. The Road is a living being. She is an enchantress and She has a long reach.
            She may at her whim lead you to the edge of the world, into the lands of light. Aye, and She could as well set you on the paths that reach only into the darkest corners of this Earth.
            The Road holds within Her an unseen current that will drag you to Her holiest shrines. There She will reveal her mighty triumphs, each greater than the last, each a song of Her splendour. In that moment when you are caught up by the travel-trance, you will become lost to all your fellow beings, though you may well be surrounded by them.
            For my part, there have been times, many times, when the will to continue on the long Road almost deserted me. There came a day, once, when my body lay battered, exhausted and near-dead and my soul yearned for the quiet respite of the lands beyond life. In all that suffering my only constant companion was the Road. It was She alone who could carry me forward to a safe-haven or to disaster, as was Her whim.
            These days I rest often and travel little. I have a room in a town, in a country far from my homeland. In this time I have no leisure to journey, but the spirit of the Road still returns to taunt me. She fills my mind with part-recollected, part-imagined scenes from my wanderings, dangling before me enticing visions of what might have been or what yet may be.
            Last night She came to me in my room as I sat strumming the harp before the fire. Yester’s eve marked the time of the Great Festival that my people called Beltinne or the Fires of Bel. The folk of this country celebrate that feast in a different manner from the tribes of Eirinn. Here the people mill around the market cross and sing and dance and when they are too tired or too drunk they return home to their beds.
            As the sounds of their merrymaking drifted in through my window, I wandered into the realm of soul-flight.  I lifted up, leaving my body behind, and sailed high up over the stone-tiled town only to float gently down again in the midst of the thronging crowds. There before me a small drama unfolded.
A child’s toy boat was swept along by the gutter-stream. Faster and faster it sailed until the heart-broken youngster could keep up no longer and was left crying in vain for his tiny craft. The cleverly carved treasure disappeared in the swirling whirlpool of a sewer grate, ever bobbing along toward the river, out of the sight and knowledge of mortals. My mind’s eye observed what happened after.
The building torrent of the flood carried the fragile ship out to meet the lapping waters of the blue depths. Far, far, ever seaward, sailed the toy. Through storms and calm it voyaged to be washed up by the tide one morning in another country where a child, not unlike the fellow who mourned its loss, found the boat, admired the workmanship, cherished the possession of it, but never guessed how long it had travelled nor whence it came.
In that vision rests the mystery of the true nature of the Road. Lost wanderers such as myself are like unto that toy boat lifted up on the wave crests of the Ocean of Being to glimpse at distant harbours from dizzy heights, only to be plunged down once more into the swell of the surging salt water before the eyes can fully focus on the horizon.
As the years continue to unfold, these trance-journeys come often to replace my clear memories of the old days. So many names and faces are lost now forever in the murky oblivion of forgetfulness. Yet I remember now, and will remember beyond this life, the dream-tales that first led me on my quests. I will remember the storytellers and their harps. I will remember the man who first spoke to me of the Road and I will remember our first meeting and our long friendship.
I will remember also the cherished gift he gave at my initiation. The gift of a name.

<p>“In life and life’s demands, we find that a woman can live with or without a man.  She can do all the things that a man does and more - working and taking care of the household. Today’s woman has two roles: she brings in money like a man, and makes decisions like a man.  The ‘soldier’ way of life is no longer lived inside the house.  There are only soldiers outside,"" says Noura (<em>27 year old who holds a Master's degree, works for a media company and lives with her husband and two kids in Ramallah).</em></p>
<p>“Religion is not the most important thing in life. It’s not about duty, it is what  calls you from within. Prayer can be a very personal thing, without showing that you’re doing it in front of the world.  But some people are afraid and they enforce <em>hijab</em>. If you don’t fear God then why fear people? If you are a good Muslim, then there is no reason to fear people”  <em>(Samira, 19 year old newlywed,</em><em> first year Birzeit University student).</em></p>
<p>“When I used to go to school in the ‘60s, you didn’t see a woman go to college.  I remember one girl who went to a private school. Women my mom’s age did not go to school.   They received zero education...more like ‘zero minus’. Marriage was more important and parents may not have been able to buy notebooks and books to send their kids to school. Villages only offered education to a certain level (4th, 5th, 6th grade) and if you wanted a higher education, you had to send your kids to a city like Ramallah or Al-Bireh. Back then transportation cost the equivalent of 5 cents  from Beitin to Ramallah.   Men could  not  afford  to  send  all  their  kids to  the  city every  day. Women did not traditionally leave the house so it was hard for them to let their daughters travel alone to  a  city.  There was also no point in sending girls to school because there were no  jobs that supported women in the marketplace.  It was shameful for women to work outside the house.  But that rendered women hopeless in trying to take care of themselves when their husbands divorced them or died..."" <em>(Yasmine, 71 year old mother of 8 children, completed 8th grade).</em></p>
<h3>Story &amp; Background</h3>
<p>This book is a reflection of 55 face-to-face interviews with Palestinian women ages 18-90, living in the West Bank.  It is my belief that, in the West, we normally do not hear about Palestinian women except in the context of religious oppression, domestic abuse or war.  I wanted to have a better understanding of how Palestinian women perceive themselves, the societies they live in, and the West.  This project is unique as it provides a first hand account of Palestinian women's thoughts, feelings and beliefs.  This book also serves as a platform to anyone interested in learning, ""Who is a Palestinian woman?""</p>
<p>This research was originally my Master's thesis, ""The Evolution of a Palestinian Woman, from 1940 until Now"" and it is in the process of being edited into a book.</p>
<p><strong>Interview questions include: </strong><br/>1.  What is the role of a Palestinian woman in society?</p>

<div><span> </span></div>
<div>I have been working with nonprofits on a wide range of technology issues for almost twenty years. I still remember helping an organization put in its first network by pulling cable in the ceiling (I think the pants I ruined doing that might still be in my rag pile). I've been on nonprofit boards (including the board of <a href=""http://nten.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NTEN</a>, the Nonprofit Technology Network, and <a href=""http://aspirationtech.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aspiration</a>.) I blogged on these topics for many years and I've seen software and hardware trends come and go, but ultimately, the same issues remain: <strong><em>Why use technology, anyway? How do we harness technology best to accomplish our mission? How do we navigate the bewildering set of options for everything from our network to social media to figure out what will work best?</em></strong>
</div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><strong>The book...</strong></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>This book, titled <strong>""Zen and the Art of Nonprofit Technolgy""</strong> aims to dig into these questions, bring out the most important factors, and provide concrete support and advice for decision-making,  but at a higher level than most resources. I won't tell you which CRM to pick, or even list the options, but I will tell you a lot about why you might or might not need one, what you can do with them, and how to go about making an informed choice based on your particular situation. I won't tell you whether to use Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest, or how make iOS or Android apps, but I will bring in resources to help you understand how to look at your constituents, and measure your impact. I will also place all of these new (and not so new) trends and technologies in context, so you can better understand the changing landscape, and when to commit resources, and when to wait. <strong><em>This book is not only about teaching you how to fish, but explaining why you should fish, and, further, when you should grow beans, or ranch cows, instead of fish.</em></strong></span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>

I have been working with nonprofits on a wide range of technology issues for almost twenty years. I still remember helping an organization put in its first network by pulling cable in the ceiling (I think the pants I ruined doing that might still be in my rag pile). I've been on nonprofit boards (including the board of NTEN, the Nonprofit Technology Network, and Aspiration.) I blogged on these topics for many years and I've seen software and hardware trends come and go, but ultimately, the same issues remain: Why use technology, anyway? How do we harness technology best to accomplish our mission? How do we navigate the bewildering set of options for everything from our network to social media to figure out what will work best?

 
The book...
 
This book, titled ""Zen and the Art of Nonprofit Technolgy"" aims to dig into these questions, bring out the most important factors, and provide concrete support and advice for decision-making,  but at a higher level than most resources. I won't tell you which CRM to pick, or even list the options, but I will tell you a lot about why you might or might not need one, what you can do with them, and how to go about making an informed choice based on your particular situation. I won't tell you whether to use Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest, or how make iOS or Android apps, but I will bring in resources to help you understand how to look at your constituents, and measure your impact. I will also place all of these new (and not so new) trends and technologies in context, so you can better understand the changing landscape, and when to commit resources, and when to wait. This book is not only about teaching you how to fish, but explaining why you should fish, and, further, when you should grow beans, or ranch cows, instead of fish.
 
I'll talk a bit about the history of technology, the use of hardware and software in nonprofits, the sometimes thorny relationships between vendors and organizations, and the political and philosophical conundrums inherent in this enterprise. The book will delve into the good old proprietary vs. open source debate, and will lay out some good, concrete answers to that debate that will help you make decisions. And, most importantly, I will explore sector-wide technology issues, and place much of this in a bigger picture context.

<p><strong>Black Nazi- A short drama film </strong></p>
<p>A young Black man who grew up in a life of privilege begins to question who he really is and the loyalty he has to the Aryan Brotherhood and his friends.</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>“Black Nazi” is a story about identity and hate. This film follows a young Black Man (Brandon) that through his loyalty to his friends and the Arian brother hood has lost a sense of who he really is. What happens when his friends get him into trouble and he starts to question everything he thinks is true, can he make the right choice before there is no going back.</p>
<p><strong>WHY HELP MAKE OUR FILM?</strong></p>
<p>""Black Nazi"" has a common theme that I feel will reach many people. Everyone has trouble with Identity &amp; Hate at some point in their lives. <span style=""font-size: medium;"">After serving in the Middle East for over a year I was discharged from the military and decided to finish my degree in theater arts. After witnessing the destruction of what hate caused, I was told I suffered from Post traumatic stress disorder from being in combat, through the grace of God and my family I checked into a PTSD combat stress program at the VA hospital, living in the hospital for a year. During my down time I decided to express myself through writing short stories. Some were about my experiences in Iraq others were about my experiences in LA. <br/><br/> When I graduated from the program and went back out to the real world I experienced the racial tension between blacks, Hispanics, and Middle Eastern people. As similar as we were I came to find out we were so divided. I found it more alarming that most of my confrontations were with fellow black people. There are more black-on-black crimes than there are hate crimes, but when someone brings that up most blacks immediately get defensive. I did more research and found out there are more same race crimes than hate crimes. What about self-hate? Everything has a beginning so I wanted to tell a story of one individuals beginning. I took a little bit of my story from being the only African American in a predominantly white school and feeling different but hating the fact that I was different. This story is very brutal and graphic but has a strong message and hopefully it will force us as a society to take a look at ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">I think this project effects everyone, hate doesn’t have a color, age, or gender it doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor. Serving in Iraq I’ve seen firsthand the devastation of hate and there’s only one thing stronger than hate it’s love but if you don’t love yourself it’s difficult to feel anything but the opposite. I hope this film can bring attention to this spreading epidemic.</span></p>

<p>Support the <strong>BESTSELLER OR BUST</strong> campaign and help <strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not </em></strong>become a self-published bestseller. Together, we can make publishing history by being the example that proves there’s a new publishing option available to self published authors that involves crowdfunding.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Campaign Goal</strong></p>
<p>To raise a $100K marketing budget to globally promote the self-published novel, <strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not,</em></strong> and take it to the bestseller list, proving that crowdfunding plus self-publishing can equal a bestseller. This will show authors everywhere that there is a viable option that exists between going the traditional publishing route and going it alone. This third option can make publishing history while demonstrating that crowdfunding not only works, it works in publishing.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Author’s Conundrum</strong></p>
<p>Those of us who write books want them to be read and enjoyed. Once a book is written, authors have two options for sharing their work - find a publisher or self publish. There are pros and cons to each, but the reality is that less than 5% of submitted manuscripts <strong>ever </strong>get published and that number is even less for<strong> new </strong>authors. </p>
<p>While most authors would love to get a publishing deal, in the rare case they do, it too often means sacrifice, compromise and inequitable royalty arrangements. So many authors are turning to self-publishing.</p>
<p>With self-publishing, the responsibility for writing, editing, cover, design and the financial burden of all publishing, marketing, and promotion for the book is the sole responsibility of the author. It can easily exceed $10K. While authors may earn more per unit on their books publishing this way, the total number of books sold rarely rivals that of their traditionally published counterparts. In fiction best-sellers are rarely self-published.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>I want to create another option that is achieves the best of both worlds. We need an alternative where it’s the market, and not a just a few big publishers, that decides what gets read and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>This third option combines self-published and crowd funded. Once a book is published, the author then turns to investors/supporters who believe in the book to provide the financial backing required to adequately launch and promote it.</p>
<p>Help me to set an example that I will then share with indie authors around the globe showing that success in fiction outside the traditional publishing industry is possible. It just requires new ways of thinking, new tools, and the support of people, like you, who see the possibilities.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How?  </strong></p>
<p>To do this requires a work of fiction to set the example and the funds to internationally promote it.  My new novel ‘<strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not’ </em></strong>is up for the challenge, are you?</p>
<p>I’m not asking you for the $5 - $10K to fund the writing, editing, cover design, web and social media development, launch, or distribution of the book. I’ve already done all that.</p>
<p>What’s I need now is a $100K marketing budget to promote the book globally.</p>
<p>If you support this campaign, you will help make publishing history by supporting the power of the indie author to achieve recognition that until now has been the bastion of the big publishers, you’ll help this author achieve a lifelong dream, and, you’ll also get some pretty awesome perks, like bookmarks, autographed copies of ‘eloves me, eloves me not’, author interviews, social media shout outs, the chance to name a character in an upcoming work or have the author write you an online dating profile. You’ll give singles and readers around the world some well-needed laughs ‘cause this book is funny! And, if I meet my target sales goal, I’ll refund your initial investment and keep your original perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why me?</strong></p>
<p>I traded a 20-year career in corporate marketing and communications career for the fresh challenge of indie author/publisher/entrepreneur so let’s just say I’m motivated to make this work!</p>
<p><strong> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l5J4UVHMW7s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFE/LvE2aYqguvk/s512-c/photo.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""LA Johannesson""/></strong></p>
<p>I’m an advocate for innovation, technology, the power of community, and I am a staunch supporter of the crowdsourcing movement. I successfully used crowdsourcing through a number of stages of the book’s development so, it makes sense to embrace crowd funding as well.</p>
<p>My dream is to have <strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not</em></strong> make the NYT Bestseller List, and to affect change in the publishing industry. I want to prove that we’ve finally reached a time when independent fiction authors can reach the pinnacle of publishing success and land themselves on the NYT bestseller list, without going the traditional publishing route. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why this book?</strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""Cover of eloves me, eloves me not of a women sitting on a red couch, laptop open on her lap, picking petals from a daisy On the floor is a glass of red wine and at the foot of the lounge is a big goofy looking golden retriever."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTOCOdLy8nqpQ3uomsoqGYOc4q1O5IYjihN9Y7Dwga6BqZzaCx_"" src="""" style="""" title=""eloves me, eloves me not cover""/></p>
<p><strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not</em></strong> is a contemporary romantic comedy about the modern quest for love. It follows singleton Kayte Wexford’s online and offline adventures, as she turns to online dating to find Mr Right. Does she find him? I can tell you this much, she certainly has fun trying!</p>
<p>Readers love ‘<strong><em>eloves me, eloves me not</em></strong>’ giving it four and five start reviews. They’re saying it’s a timely coming-of-age story, that it’s witty, relatable, detailed and well written. You can find reader reviews here: <a href=""http://lajohannesson.com/eloves-me-eloves-me-not/reader-reviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lajohannesson.com/eloves-me-eloves-me-not/reader-reviews/</a></p>
<p>This book has global resonance and needs to be promoted to a larger audience. When readers worldwide have the chance to enjoy it, it can then achieve the commercial success it deserves.</p>
<p>The market potential for a novel about online dating is mammoth. Statistics from the US alone indicate that 40 million people have visited online dating sites. 40 million! If just .25 per cent of them were to buy this book, this would meet this year’s target sales goal. That’s less than one per cent and that represents the US alone! Have I mentioned that the book is for sale in at least 10 countries?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>A marketing budget of $100K is required to fund this vital promotional stage.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a sizable amount of money, but it is also a sizable goal that is capable of realising sizable returns!</p>
<p>This money will be used to globally promote the independently authored and published novel, <em>‘eloves me, eloves me not’ </em>so that it can make it to The New York Times bestseller list, proving the commercial potential of the indie fiction author of today.</p>
<p>If you help, and I hope that you do, you will receive the perks as outlined here by investment level. They will be delivered to investors by <strong>01 July 2013</strong>, with the exception of the speaking and in-person appearances. These will need to be scheduled in advance and delivered throughout the balance of the 2013 calendar year.</p>
<p>Being a romance author, I’m expected to provide you the happily ever after.</p>
<p><strong>SO… HERE’S THE CLINCHER!</strong></p>
<p>If the funds raised lead to the realisation of a sales target of 100,000 copies buy the end of 2013,<strong> I WILL REFUND YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT AMOUNT AND YOU’LL GET TO KEEP YOUR ORIGINAL CAMPAIGN PERKS.</strong></p>
<p>Plus, I will make a $5,000 donation to my pet charity, Golden Retriever Rescue. </p>
<p>Plus, I will create a best practice case study based on my experiences and share it freely with the independent author community.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://lajohannesson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Dog-BG.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Dylan""/></p>
<p>How’s that for a happy ending?</p>
<p>In the event that I do not raise the whole $100K, (<strong><em>but that’s not going to happen, right?)</em></strong> I will divide whatever funds are raised in a similar ratio to what is outlned.  Here's a basic breakout as to how the funds will be spent.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We both know this project isn’t going to create world peace. But it can make a difference<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p>It can help to drive needed change within the publishing industry. It can provide hope, inspiration and a shining example for independent authors around the globe.</p>
<p>It can help raise the awareness of the ‘business of creativity’ and it gives you a chance to demonstrate that crowd funding offers a viable alternative to more traditional approaches.  And your support can help this dedicated indie author to earn a living doing what she loves and to realise a dream – one she is already so deeply vested in.</p>
<p>And you will have done your part to bring a great story to bibliophiles and singletons everywhere, by introducing them to <strong><em>‘eloves me, eloves me not’ </em></strong>– it’s sure to deliver a few hours of reading enjoyment, some insight into online dating and heaps of laughs! </p>
<p>And, if things work out as I hope they will (sales of 100,000 copies within 2013), not only will you get some fabulous perks, a great feeling from supporting a worthy initiative, but you will also get your initial investment back. How many campaigns offer you that?</p>
<p>And, a case study, with step by step actions, tips and suggestions will be shared with other indie authors to help them to achieve similar success. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help </strong></p>
<p>Some people want to help but can’t contribute financially, and that’s okay. There are other ways you can help. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>share the link for this campaign with your network – friends, families, co-workers</li>
<li>connect and share the links for the book through social media - follow us, friend us, link to us, blog us, like us, share us, circle us, tweet us, pin us… you get the idea (see all the links below)</li>
<li>tell anyone you know who’s online dating about the book – trust me, they’ll relate</li>
<li>say a prayer, if that’s your thing</li>
<li>send positive thoughts out into the universe</li>
<li>discuss the campaign, the crowd funding movement, the book, the changes in the publishing industry, the challenge of the indie author</li>
<li>consider an indie book, the next time you’re looking for a good read.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Thank You!</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering supporting my dream.</p>
<p>What are <em>your</em> dreams?</p>

Believing that no one should be treated as a criminal for using marijuana, I have been a tireless advocate for the medical marijuana program in our state, and in 2012 I helped lead the student movement to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana. Now my eyes are set on an even larger goal: ending marijuana prohibition in the Ocean State. Treating marijuana use, sale, and cultivation as crimes has proven to be one of the most destructive and wasteful government policies of the last century. Regulate Rhode Island represents a broad coalition of advocates who believe it's time for a new approach.

<h2><strong>From Tupperware Lady to CEO</strong></h2>
<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
Who's the ULTIMATE business partner?  The one who's always there by your side?  God, of course!  In this wonderful new book - <strong><em>Is God's Hand On Your Business?</em></strong> - CEO and author Kathy Hill describes her 20 years of ""watching God's hand hover over"" her business growth and development - guiding her from humble beginnings to great entrepreneurial success.  You'll be fascinated by her story - from her humble beginning selling Tupperware in her 20's - through her founding of the prominent tax representation company, Tax Tiger, which helps taxpayers resolve their liabilities to the IRS.</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Author Biography:</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Kathy Hill Image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.tax-tiger.com/sites/default/files/ceo-frame.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Kathy Hill grew up as a pastor's kid spending time in both, Colorado and California.  She worked her way through business as a successful home-based Tupperware lady, to the CEO and founder of a national tax representation company, <strong><a href=""http://www.tax-tiger.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tax Tiger</a></strong>, and along the way she inspired, motivated, and produced incredible results.  Her story is balanced with her unwavering faith in God, and what HIS place should be in your growing business and personal life.  Trial after trial, success after success, <strong>nothing seemed to stand in the way of a business backed by God</strong>, nor would it stop that train from moving forward.  After reading this book, you will most certainly envision a new outlook on your business today, and what the future should hold.  Kathy utilizes these same principles in leading church small groups and women's prison ministries.</p>
<p>Some of the most successful CEO's and companies alike, are headed by individuals with a strong and unwavering faith, morals, ethics, and care for others.  <strong>This book will take you on her journey and inspire you.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><em>""For I know the plans I have for you declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you; plans to give you hope and a future.""</em> - NIV Jeremiah 29:11</p>
<h3><strong>Message from the Author:</strong></h3>
<p>I titled the book - <strong><em>Is God's Hand On Your Business?</em></strong> - because I have had the incredible experience over the past 20 years of my life to watch how God's hand hovers over my business growth and development.</p>
<p>It started when I became a Tupperware lady in my early 20's to earn some extra income for my family, and I found that God had given me skills that I didn't know I had.  Over the years, He led me through many new, and sometimes difficult business arenas, but all of them were for a reason and part of the grand plan that He had for my life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I founded my own company <strong><a href=""http://www.tax-tiger.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tax Tiger</a></strong>, a tax representation company established to help aid taxpayers with difficult tax situations and liabilities, who are left with nowhere to turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is God's Hand On Your Business?</em></strong> - is not only my collection of stories  of God's favor and my unwavering faith, but also 15 key principles that I believe caused God's hand to hover over my endeavors.  These same principles can be applied to any business for greater financial and spiritual growth, and God has placed it on my heart to share them with both, successful and struggling business owners, so that they may soar like eagles.</p>
<p><em>""May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us; establish the work of our hands for us - yes, establish the work of our hands.""</em> - NIV Psalm 90:17</p>
<h3><strong>Why I wrote this book:</strong></h3>
<p>This book comes from the encouragement and prodding of so many people who have heard my amazing story and told me to put it down on paper.  I've never quite had the time to tackle such a large project until last year when I was encouraged once again by a dear friend, and it was in that moment that God clearly said to me, ""Yes, you need to do this.""  At that moment, writing the book became more about the people I could help by sharing my story, than about the time sacrifice it would take to develop it.</p>
<p>I reflected on the things that I do on a regular basis, day in and day out, which would cause God's hand to be on my business, and what I found were <strong>15 Essential Principles for Success and Prosperity</strong>.  I am 100% certain that God is going to use this book in a mighty and powerful way for struggling businesses to promote a turn around in today's tough economy, and for already successful businesses to prosper further.</p>
<p>This became another <strong>""burning bush""</strong> moment for me, and clearly outside of my comfort zone, but then again, God has been doing things with me for years that pushed me outside of my comfort zone, and because I was obedient, He has blessed me each and every time.</p>
<p>My company, <strong><a href=""http://www.tax-tiger.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tax Tiger</a></strong>, just celebrated its 11 year anniversary, and over those 11 years we have helped thousands of taxpayers resolve their tax liabilities with the IRS.  The financial burdens they carried were lifted off of their shoulders, erasing fear, stress, and sleepless nights.  We have even literally saved lives, giving back hope and peace of mind with exceptional results. </p>
<p><strong>Here are a few words from someone essential in helping me start my business:</strong></p>
<p>""I joined forces with Kathy in 2002 to aid her in starting Tax Tiger.  There were constant challenges and we had our share of bumps and bruises along the way, but we were determined, and <strong>you never have met a more tenacious person with unshakable faith than Kathy Hill</strong>.  On one particular occasion, Kathy had let me know of a specific direction she wanted to take the business.  I was thinking to myself how she was nuts to think we could make that plan work.  Doing my best to be supportive though, I shared with Kathy that I would be in the trenches with her, however challenging and far reaching it was.  She assured me that she has been praying on it that morning, and that it was the exact course to take.  I chuckled, knowing her strength and mind, and we went to work.  Not twenty minutes later, I received a phone call from a random company that had been referred to us about opening a dialogue towards an alliance and partnership, the exact goal we were speaking of earlier that morning.  I said to her, ""There you go praying again!"".  That phrase has turned out to be one of my most used phrases with Kathy.  She should be the poster child for ""Prayer Works""!  I have now had the pleasure of knowing this amazing woman for eleven years and am blessed to have her in my life.  Little does Kathy know what a huge influence she has been, and continues to be, for me.  Often times when I'm setting out to accomplish a specific goal and I'm feeling a little insecure, I think to myself, ""How would Kathy handle this?""  Undoubtedly, the answer always follows, ""Pray on it, and then give thanks knowing it IS done.""  Listen to this woman, you will learn a lot.<strong> - Past Director of Operations, Carla Giampapa</strong></p>

and if all goes as hoped, a couple years from now one or both projects could bloom out into the world as a new release
movie. In the theater, you could nudge the person next to you and tell them how you took part in making it
happen.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Despite the fact that 1 in 10 Canadians will suffer from PTSD in their lifetime (<a href=""http://www.chma.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chma.ca</a>), PTSD is still very much a misunderstood &amp; stigmatized condition.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> As Melinda Smith, M.A., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D. (2013) so kindly wrote:</span></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following a traumatic event that threatens your safety or makes you feel helpless. Most people associate PTSD with battle-scarred soldiers—and military combat is the most common cause in men—but any overwhelming life experience can trigger PTSD, especially if the event feels unpredictable and uncontrollable.</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can affect those who personally experience the catastrophe, those who witness it, and those who pick up the pieces afterwards, including emergency workers and law enforcement officers. It can even occur in the friends or family members of those who went through the actual trauma. PTSD develops differently from person to person. While the symptoms of PTSD most commonly develop in the hours or days following the traumatic event, it can sometimes take weeks, months, or even years before they appear. </i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Following a traumatic event, almost everyone experiences at least some of the symptoms of PTSD. When your sense of safety and trust are shattered, it’s normal to feel crazy, disconnected, or numb. It’s very common to have bad dreams, feel fearful, and find it difficult to stop thinking about what happened. These are normal reactions to abnormal events.</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">For most people, however, these symptoms are short-lived. They may last for several days or even weeks, but they gradually lift. But if you have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the symptoms don’t decrease. You don’t feel a little better each day. In fact, you may start to feel worse.</i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">A normal response to trauma becomes PTSD when you become stuck </i></p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">After a traumatic experience, the mind and the body are in shock. But as you make sense of what happened and process your emotions, you come out of it. With post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however, you remain in psychological shock. Your memory of what happened and your feelings about it are disconnected. In order to move on, it’s important to face and feel your memories and emotions.</i></p>

<p><i style=""font-weight: normal;""><i> Why should I seek help for PTSD?</i><br/></i></p>
<ul>
<li><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Early treatment is better. Symptoms of PTSD may get worse. Dealing with them now might help stop them from getting worse in the future.

<li><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">PTSD symptoms can change family life. PTSD symptoms can get in the way of your family life.

<li><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">PTSD can be related to other health problems. PTSD symptoms can make physical health problems worse. For example, studies have shown a relationship between PTSD and heart trouble. By getting help for your PTSD you could also improve your physical health.</i></li>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is VERY important to find a counselor who is Trauma trained or familiar with PTSD (but any counselor can help you through a tough time until you find one!).  I could easily have been misdiagnosed if mine was not.  It is sad and scary but a reality, so Trauma trained &amp; PTSD, remember to mention those!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">LIVING THE DARKNESS:MY LIFE WITH PTSD, is my personal account of PTSD and my understanding of it. </span></p>
<p><b>What caused my PTSD and inspired this project?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I was in a Motor Vehicle Accident and somehow got lost in the darkness of myself that I had no idea existed.  I went from listening to spiritual reggae music to gangsta rap.  My family doctor (who has saved me from a deep rooted depression in the past) looked at me almost in tears, shock apparent at the scared animal that had replaced the ever loving, humanitarian he has treated for almost 10 years now. The blankness in my eyes with the confident smile scared him as much as it did me the first time I noticed it. It is hard being in a room with people you love and them looking at you afraid of the stranger occupying the body that once belonged to someone they love. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I saw two soldiers on their lunch break; I went to them and huddled, ensuring they knew there was no shame in getting help for PTSD, breaking into tears and explaining I am suffering and getting the help I need. Then I left. The older, distant man came to my car after reached in hugging me and said thank you. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I knew then and there I need to tell my story, help the medical community and fighters/families of this dark, consuming illness understand the importance of continued research to fund better treatments for  PTSD. Within the hour someone had introduced me to crowdfunding and a light bulb went off. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As an avid reader, I KNOW my honest, real life story to be greater and stranger than fiction. LIVING THE DARKNESS:MY LIFE WITH PTSD is my contribution to DESTROYING the stigma attached to PTSD ( and mental illness in general). I also believe that when things are meant to be, the universe lines things up (like in my story).  But it is up to us to open our hearts and listen. There is no shame in getting the needed help.  Please help me spread this message.</span></p>

Knowledge is TRUE POWER so let us begin with the education portion:
What is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)?
Despite the fact that 1 in 10 Canadians will suffer from PTSD in their lifetime (www.chma.ca), PTSD is still very much a misunderstood & stigmatized condition.
I have tried writing based upon the research I have gathered for myself, but things did not seem very clear.  I came across a great article at a wonderful website from which I am going to share.  The website and article link is: 
http://www.helpguide.org/mental/post_traumatic_stress_disorder_symptoms_treatment.htm
Please visit it for further information to help you and your loved one!  I will be tweeting the link to this article regularly as a big thank you for them having created it and for their help in providing me with insight into my own disorder.
 As Melinda Smith, M.A., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D. (2013) so kindly wrote:

Most people associate PTSD with battle-scarred soldiers—and military combat is the most common cause in men—but any overwhelming life experience can trigger PTSD, especially if the event feels unpredictable and uncontrollable.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can affect those who personally experience the catastrophe, those who witness it, and those who pick up the pieces afterwards, including emergency workers and law enforcement officers. It can even occur in the friends or family members of those who went through the actual trauma. PTSD develops differently from person to person.

Following a traumatic event, almost everyone experiences at least some of the symptoms of PTSD. When your sense of safety and trust are shattered, it’s normal to feel crazy, disconnected, or numb. It’s very common to have bad dreams, feel fearful, and find it difficult to stop thinking about what happened. These are normal reactions to abnormal events.

After a traumatic experience, the mind and the body are in shock. But as you make sense of what happened and process your emotions, you come out of it. With post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), however, you remain in psychological shock. Your memory of what happened and your feelings about it are disconnected. In order to move on, it’s important to face and feel your memories and emotions.
Symptoms of PTSD: Re-experiencing the traumatic event

Intrusive, upsetting memories of the event
Flashbacks (acting or feeling like the event is happening again)
Nightmares (either of the event or of other frightening things)
Feelings of intense distress when reminded of the trauma
Intense physical reactions to reminders of the event (e.g. pounding heart, rapid breathing, nausea, muscle tension, sweating)

Symptoms of PTSD: Avoidance and numbing

Avoiding activities, places, thoughts, or feelings that remind you of the trauma
Inability to remember important aspects of the trauma
Loss of interest in activities and life in general
Feeling detached from others and emotionally numb
Sense of a limited future (you don’t expect to live a normal life span, get married, have a career)

Symtoms of PTSD: Increased anxiety and emotional arousal

Difficulty falling or staying asleep
Irritability or outbursts of anger
Difficulty concentrating
Hypervigilance (on constant “red alert”)
Feeling jumpy and easily startled

 Other common symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

Anger and irritability
Guilt, shame, or self-blame
Substance abuse
Feelings of mistrust and betrayal


Depression and hopelessness
Suicidal thoughts and feelings
Feeling alienated and alone
Physical aches and pains

Symptoms of PTSD in children and adolescents
In children—especially those who are very young—the symptoms of PTSD can be different than the symptoms in adults. Symptoms in children include:

Fear of being separated from parent
Losing previously-acquired skills (such as toilet training)
Sleep problems and nightmares without recognizable content
Somber, compulsive play in which themes or aspects of the trauma are repeated
New phobias and anxieties that seem unrelated to the trauma (such as a fear of monsters)
Acting out the trauma through play, stories, or drawings
Aches and pains with no apparent cause
Irritability and aggression

Early treatment is better. Symptoms of PTSD may get worse. Dealing with them now might help stop them from getting worse in the future. Finding out more about what treatments work, where to look for help, and what kind of questions to ask can make it easier to get help and lead to better outcomes.
PTSD symptoms can change family life. PTSD symptoms can get in the way of your family life. You may find that you pull away from loved ones, are not able to get along with people, or that you are angry or even violent. Getting help for your PTSD can help improve your family life.
PTSD can be related to other health problems. PTSD symptoms can make physical health problems worse. For example, studies have shown a relationship between PTSD and heart trouble. By getting help for your PTSD you could also improve your physical health.

Now the 'About Me' section.  Let's begin with my daily PSA:
Please help yourself and get the help you need, there is NO SHAME! Even though life might seem hopeless right now, there is hope because I have seen a glimpse of it and I'm gonna to at least fight to try to be my normal self again!
It is VERY important to find a counselor who is Trauma trained or familiar with PTSD (but any counselor can help you through a tough time until you find one!).  I could easily have been misdiagnosed if mine was not.  It is sad and scary but a reality, so Trauma trained & PTSD, remember to mention those!
LIVING THE DARKNESS:MY LIFE WITH PTSD, is my personal account of PTSD and my understanding of it. 
What caused my PTSD and inspired this project?
I was in a Motor Vehicle Accident and somehow got lost in the darkness of myself that I had no idea existed.  I went from listening to spiritual reggae music to gangsta rap.  My family doctor (who has saved me from a deep rooted depression in the past) looked at me almost in tears, shock apparent at the scared animal that had replaced the ever loving, humanitarian he has treated for almost 10 years now. The blankness in my eyes with the confident smile scared him as much as it did me the first time I noticed it. It is hard being in a room with people you love and them looking at you afraid of the stranger occupying the body that once belonged to someone they love. 
I saw two soldiers on their lunch break; I went to them and huddled, ensuring they knew there was no shame in getting help for PTSD, breaking into tears and explaining I am suffering and getting the help I need. Then I left. The older, distant man came to my car after reached in hugging me and said thank you. 
I knew then and there I need to tell my story, help the medical community and fighters/families of this dark, consuming illness understand the importance of continued research to fund better treatments for  PTSD. Within the hour someone had introduced me to crowdfunding and a light bulb went off. 
As an avid reader, I KNOW my honest, real life story to be greater and stranger than fiction. LIVING THE DARKNESS:MY LIFE WITH PTSD is my contribution to DESTROYING the stigma attached to PTSD ( and mental illness in general). I also believe that when things are meant to be, the universe lines things up (like in my story).  But it is up to us to open our hearts and listen. There is no shame in getting the needed help.  Please help me spread this message.
Stretch goals if my $7,500 goal is exceeded:
At $10,000 I will do the research for a local  PTSD Public education program.
At $15,000 I will locally implement PTSD Public education program (which is not currently available in my city).
At $20,000 I will create and run a community PTSD peer support group (which is not currently available in my city).
At $75,000 I will take a year off my job (when I get back there!)  to promote my book throughout North America in 2015.
At $100,000 or greater I will add as many international dates as possible to promote book and public education programs in 2015.
***Regardless of these stretch goals, I would like it to be clear these are projects my future hold regardless!  The time frame, as always, is dependent upon financial constraints.  It's the way of the world!
Blessings, Light & Love,
Smokes Torres@kwestladi (Twitter)
P.S I am also the artist of any visual art you see used in this project.
Please Note: This book deals with disturbing darkness and also sometimes uses explicit, classless language. After much consideration if this was necessary, I have decided it is to truly show what my monster looks like.  There will be no stretch of the facts because there is no need for it, I could not make up half of what I have had to live!  
Risks and Challenges
The biggest risk is that I am suffering with PTSD and have no idea where this journey will take me. If my illness gets even more severe, at worst my release date may be delayed. All the research I have read strongly suggests that helping others is one of the quickest ways to reconnect to emotions and begin reintegration back into one's previous community. Also I have always dreamed of writing a book, so in a sense telling readers how my dream life was taken away due to someone texting while driving, by fulfilling a different dream is empowering. 
Remember Most Importantly... 
I am COMMITTED to DESTROYING THE STIGMA of PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder)! There's no shame in asking for help because it is hard. I hope my book inspires people to adapt that world view.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Low Down Publishing is producing ultra-high-quality resources for music educators and self-guided learners. By donating to our campaign you will aid us in producing these five texts, written to fill gaps in music education literature. Starting with a $25 donation, we will gift you with the book of your choice! What do you want the low down on?</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Few things are more exciting than finding a book that really helps you learn something deeply. Whether it’s learning how to play guitar, or how to handle your first classroom as a teacher, nothing beats finding the right tool to help you succeed. We all know this tool, too—the one that enables the""<i>aha!</i>"" moment—and instantly connects with you, leaving you feeling empowered.</p>
<p>However, searching for the <i>right</i> book can often feel like a herculean task. We've been there, trying to find the right book to use with our students or just on our own. That’s why we created Low Down Publishing—<strong>to develop books specifically for music teachers and self-guided learners</strong>—and eliminate the stressful process of finding the right resource. We make the <i>""aha!"" </i>moment a core part of your learning experience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here’s the truth—books have a seemingly<i> impossible</i> job.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine having to create a resource that captures the interest of a diverse audience and teaches them a skill in detail, yet you don't know exactly who will be using it. You may never meet your reader face to face or understand what their individual needs are. Further, once it leaves your hands, you can’t control how they use or interpret it. No wonder it can be so hard to find the right book that <strong>connects with <i>you!</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It doesn’t have to be, though.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Look—we understand that no book is a catch-all and no book can ever replace a great teacher. However, we recognize that great teachers and students need great resources; books and tools that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up-to-date with current musical trends and issues</li>
<li>Targeted to produce specific learning outcomes</li>
<li>Broad enough to reach students with diverse interests, yet</li>
<li>Helpful to teachers with wide-ranging teaching experiences</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything we produce is built on research findings. Our resources provide expert opinions and leave room for teachers and students to draw their own conclusions and decide how to best apply them. Our resources help to eliminate the question, ""Will this resource work for me?""</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>The publishing bug hit Danny in 2013 while teaching at SUNY Oswego. After studying available bass resources, and unable to find the exact right book to fit his bass students’ needs, he wrote <i>The Low Down Vol. 1</i>—a teaching sequence for walking bass lines, targeted directly at his students. Inspired by the results in his students and positive feedback from the bass community, Danny continued in 2016 with <i>The Low Down Vol. 2</i>.</p>
<p><i>(Creating DIY books can feel like an insane task, especially without many author resources available to musicians. This was the major impetus for us offering author services—but more on that later).</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568199197/qkywqjt1ty4tdpircp4y.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Danny's first three publications</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Danny's curiosities led him back to the Eastman School of Music in 2016, where he also met Erik Piazza, John Mills, and Michael Sherman. Danny's research focus and master’s thesis was on jazz double bass pedagogy, which helped form the basis of <i>Topics in Jazz Bass</i> (2018). Numerous discussions amongst the founders about teaching, research, and the need for more resources ultimately formed the foundation of LDP.</p>

<p><i>Okay, so technically Danny’s first book was written when he was 7, not 24… but his mom and dad paid for the only available copy. It was a low budget production (&lt;$10) and he was forced to do his own illustrative work.</i></p>

<h2>Our 2020 Catalog</h2>
<p>These books represent research of their respective fields and are written by some of the best musicians and educators today.  <i>[Titles are subject to change; content will not change]</i></p>
<p><u><strong>The Art of Combining Chords and Melodies on Guitar </strong></u><i>by Bob Sneider (Guitarist, Professor at Eastman School of Music)</i>. Bob presents his innovative approach to playing chord melodies on guitar in solo and trio settings, complete with supplemental audio. </p>
<p><b><u>A Practical Rudimental Approach to Drumming Vol. 1</u> </b><i>By Carmen Intorre Jr (Drummer for the Pat Martino Trio)</i>. Carmen's book will help beginning percussion students learn the rudiments and how to musically apply them to the drumset.</p>
<p><b><u>Jazz Warmups for All Instrumentalists</u> </b><i>by Doug Stone (Saxophonist, Professor of Jazz at Louisiana State University)</i>. Doug's jazz warmup helps all instrumentalists, regardless of experience, develop vocabulary as a part of their daily practice routine.</p>
<p><u><strong>Topics in Jazz Bass Vol. 2: Soloing </strong></u><i>by Danny Ziemann</i>. This book will serve bassists looking to improve their soloing practice. Each chapter serves as a standalone topic, offering many practice techniques bassists can incorporate to develop soloing vocabulary. Many exercises include embedded ear training, perfect for bassists of all experience levels.</p>
<p><u><b>Practical Advice for Reflective Music Teachers </b></u><i>by John Mills, Erik Piazza, and Danny Ziemann. </i>This resource is targeted at pre-service and beginning music teachers, using scenarios and vignettes to examine some of the common beliefs or questions teachers might have in their careers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>In addition to our 2020 catalog, we're providing perks including: skype lessons, internet masterclasses, compositions named after you, special videos, and book dedications. These perks are <i>only </i>available through our campaign. <strong>If your reward includes one or more of our titles, please email <a href=""mailto:info@lowdownpublishing.com?subject=Indiegogo%20title%20choice"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@lowdownpublishing.com</a> with your choice!</strong></p>

<p>Making a book is expensive, let alone <i>five!</i>  The bulk of our operating costs are design-related.

Then, of course, there’s the cost of printing, print setup fees, ISBNs, copyrights, online hosting for our supplemental material, shipping costs, and revisions.</p>
<p>All books are currently being written and in various editing stages. We have our latest deadline as December 2020, though we aim to have everything done much earlier than that!</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Meeting deadlines while managing the production of multiple books can be difficult, and of course, presents the biggest risk. However, the founders' publishing experience helps to mitigate risk and keep a strict production deadline. Each author follows a schedule, in collaboration with the founders, to help meet projected deadlines.</p>

Everything we produce is built on research findings. Our resources provide expert opinions and leave room for teachers and students to draw their own conclusions and decide how to best apply them. Our resources help to eliminate the question, ""Will this resource work for me?""
 
Our Story
The publishing bug hit Danny in 2013 while teaching at SUNY Oswego. After studying available bass resources, and unable to find the exact right book to fit his bass students’ needs, he wrote The Low Down Vol. 1—a teaching sequence for walking bass lines, targeted directly at his students. Inspired by the results in his students and positive feedback from the bass community, Danny continued in 2016 with The Low Down Vol. 2.
(Creating DIY books can feel like an insane task, especially without many author resources available to musicians. This was the major impetus for us offering author services—but more on that later).

Danny's first three publications
 
Danny's curiosities led him back to the Eastman School of Music in 2016, where he also met Erik Piazza, John Mills, and Michael Sherman. Danny's research focus and master’s thesis was on jazz double bass pedagogy, which helped form the basis of Topics in Jazz Bass (2018). Numerous discussions amongst the founders about teaching, research, and the need for more resources ultimately formed the foundation of LDP.
 

Okay, so technically Danny’s first book was written when he was 7, not 24… but his mom and dad paid for the only available copy. It was a low budget production (<$10) and he was forced to do his own illustrative work.
 
Our 2020 Catalog
These books represent research of their respective fields and are written by some of the best musicians and educators today.  [Titles are subject to change; content will not change]
The Art of Combining Chords and Melodies on Guitar by Bob Sneider (Guitarist, Professor at Eastman School of Music). Bob presents his innovative approach to playing chord melodies on guitar in solo and trio settings, complete with supplemental audio. 
A Practical Rudimental Approach to Drumming Vol. 1 By Carmen Intorre Jr (Drummer for the Pat Martino Trio). Carmen's book will help beginning percussion students learn the rudiments and how to musically apply them to the drumset.
Jazz Warmups for All Instrumentalists by Doug Stone (Saxophonist, Professor of Jazz at Louisiana State University). Doug's jazz warmup helps all instrumentalists, regardless of experience, develop vocabulary as a part of their daily practice routine.
Topics in Jazz Bass Vol. 2: Soloing by Danny Ziemann. This book will serve bassists looking to improve their soloing practice. Each chapter serves as a standalone topic, offering many practice techniques bassists can incorporate to develop soloing vocabulary. Many exercises include embedded ear training, perfect for bassists of all experience levels.
Practical Advice for Reflective Music Teachers by John Mills, Erik Piazza, and Danny Ziemann. This resource is targeted at pre-service and beginning music teachers, using scenarios and vignettes to examine some of the common beliefs or questions teachers might have in their careers.
 
Rewards
In addition to our 2020 catalog, we're providing perks including: skype lessons, internet masterclasses, compositions named after you, special videos, and book dedications. These perks are only available through our campaign. If your reward includes one or more of our titles, please email info@lowdownpublishing.com with your choice!

Note: All rewards have an estimated delivery date of ""by December 2020"", though our projected timeline for the books is mid-2020. 
Budget & Timeline
Making a book is expensive, let alone five!  The bulk of our operating costs are design-related. Compelling artwork and proper typesetting ensure that you will have the best engagement with the book. Then, of course, there’s the cost of printing, print setup fees, ISBNs, copyrights, online hosting for our supplemental material, shipping costs, and revisions.
All books are currently being written and in various editing stages. We have our latest deadline as December 2020, though we aim to have everything done much earlier than that!
 

Who We Are
LDP is a four-person team, led by Danny Ziemann, with combined decades of teaching experience and professional performing experience, and mentorship by the NextCorps business incubator.

 
Risks & Challenges
Meeting deadlines while managing the production of multiple books can be difficult, and of course, presents the biggest risk. However, the founders' publishing experience helps to mitigate risk and keep a strict production deadline. Each author follows a schedule, in collaboration with the founders, to help meet projected deadlines.
