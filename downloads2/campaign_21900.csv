What many people do not think about is how those who have immigrated to this country now have given birth to second, third, and even fourth generations. A new culture has emerged!

From all over the republic they came together to dance with us. 2011 was the first setback: we wanted to arrange the meet with the permission of the government. The bureaucracy failed, the place we were looking for, was owned partly by the town itself and a land agency. But we didn't want to cancel the event, as hundreds have already submitted vacations for that day. I wrote a letter to the major, nevertheless we arranged the event at the next day. The people came to dance and listen to the music, so the police did and closed it. The letter to the major made an impact. The next year we sat together in the town hall, discussed and got a place to dance and play music! A committee for youth in public subsidized fruits, water and the equipment rental. You can see how it all passed off on our YouTube Channel.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>2014 – the next set back.</h3>Except a bar forced us to lower the music in 2012, till 2013 it all went great. But the place we switched to 2013 interferes now with a construction site. It's growing and growing and growing. So we changed the location to the other side of the place in 2014, closer to the power and more place – we thought it…<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The day started with police and ended the same. At the parking area, next to the place was mart - as every saturday (why didn't we recognized it last year? Anyway...). Our tends obstructed the approach from the pedestrian area to the parking area - so the head of the mart said (seems logic - a approach from a pedestrian area). After an hour of nonsense talking with him, he accepted, that every market stall can use the normal approaches - no one of them had a problem with it, reluctantly. We started half an hour later than planned. But the next problem wasn't far away. The buildings were all old, the windows too, so they didn't absorb any sound. A resident complained about the loudness, so we had to dramatically decrease it. Few minutes before the end a police car joined us – tired officers, just asking when the event will close as another complain reached them. We told them that there are just two more songs, they nodded, sat back into the car and snoozed till it was quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><h3>What's now?</h3>The place gets more and more unattractive, but the floor is still one of the best in that dimension in the city. We haven't got that much options left, so we need your help.<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is a nice place, covered by a big roof at and fast reachable from the main station at the fairgrounds, where 2000 the Expo took place. But it's owned by the fair agency, so we can't get it as cheap as places owned by the town itself. We will lose the electric power box - sponsored by a company which raises ""skate by night"", a skate through the whole city allover the roads - a</span>s well. We have sponsored the event the last years from our private money. It was already a three-digit amount, but now grows up to an amount with a digit more. But if we all invest small amounts, in sum it will be enough to do it once more!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Support is all we need</h3> <p>If you like our event, but can't donate, we'll be pleased if you spread the love by sharing! If you have some ideas that could help us, don't hesitate to text us! Just add a comment or write us at indiegogo@rvltn.net</p>

It's growing and growing and growing. So we changed the location to the other side of the place in 2014, closer to the power and more place – we thought it…
The day started with police and ended the same. At the parking area, next to the place was mart - as every saturday (why didn't we recognized it last year? Anyway...). Our tends obstructed the approach from the pedestrian area to the parking area - so the head of the mart said (seems logic - a approach from a pedestrian area). After an hour of nonsense talking with him, he accepted, that every market stall can use the normal approaches - no one of them had a problem with it, reluctantly. We started half an hour later than planned. But the next problem wasn't far away. The buildings were all old, the windows too, so they didn't absorb any sound. A resident complained about the loudness, so we had to dramatically decrease it. Few minutes before the end a police car joined us – tired officers, just asking when the event will close as another complain reached them. We told them that there are just two more songs, they nodded, sat back into the car and snoozed till it was quiet.
What's now?The place gets more and more unattractive, but the floor is still one of the best in that dimension in the city. We haven't got that much options left, so we need your help.
There is a nice place, covered by a big roof at and fast reachable from the main station at the fairgrounds, where 2000 the Expo took place. But it's owned by the fair agency, so we can't get it as cheap as places owned by the town itself. We will lose the electric power box - sponsored by a company which raises ""skate by night"", a skate through the whole city allover the roads - as well. We have sponsored the event the last years from our private money. It was already a three-digit amount, but now grows up to an amount with a digit more. But if we all invest small amounts, in sum it will be enough to do it once more!   Support is all we need If you like our event, but can't donate, we'll be pleased if you spread the love by sharing! If you have some ideas that could help us, don't hesitate to text us! Just add a comment or write us at indiegogo@rvltn.net",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We acknowledge that at present we are being spare on details. It doesn't mean we don't have them. We've been exploring options for creating a new theatrical performance venue on a few different scales. The most basic incarnation would be a black box theatre with a seating capacity of approx 60-100, and the ideas we have grow and expand from there. Let us be clear - we are not saying that our budget for the entire project is the $130,000 that we are fundraising - simply that it is what we hope to raise in addition to the capital we already have for the project. We want to create the best space that we can, and make the best investment we can, both for Workshop Theatre and the Calgary Theatre Community. The additional capital we are hoping to raise via crowd-sourcing is going to factor in to what we are able to achieve with regard to the overall project. </p>
<p>We will continue to update on where we are at with things in the next few weeks, but we felt that it was important to get the ball rolling!</p>
<p>So...for now...those of you who aren't familiar with our history, a little backstory...We are Calgary's Longest Running Community Theatre and will be celebrating our 49th year this season. </p>
<p>In the early 1940s a very talented and highly dedicated teacher taught drama in Room 14 at Western Canada High School. Her name was Betty Mitchell and her methods were avant-garde at the time. Her pupils were so inspired to continue in theatre after leaving high school that Miss Mitchell constituted an amateur theatre company. This was the birth of Workshop 14. From 1959 through 1965 Workshop 14 thrived. It later amalgamated with the Musicians and Actors Club, housed in the old Isis Movie House, across the railway tracks on First Street S.W., and became Mac 14. <br/>By the end of the 1960's Theatre Calgary emerged from Mac 14 and it was felt that a community theatre arm should continue in the footsteps of what had been a noble element in Calgary's theatre scene. Workshop Theatre was formed and mounted its first season in 1969-1970. <br/>Workshop Theatre is Calgary's longest running community theatre organization. This volunteer-operated organization performs four main stage productions during the year, all at Pumphouse Theatre. Workshop Theatre produces some of the best community theatre in Calgary with past and present hits from New York, London and Canadian stages, as well as new works by local playwrights using non-equity performers and backstage crews from the Calgary area. <br/>Workshop Theatre is committed to providing local theatre enthusiasts an opportunity to develop and master their performance and stagecraft skills.</p>

She's a promising poet without a muse, a single mother without lessons to pass along. Her dating life's a shambles, and her “helpful” friends are only helping make things more complicated. “This” by Vancouver born, “House of Cards” show runner, Melissa James Gibson is a bright, witty, un-romantic comedy that follows the uncertain steps of a circle of friends navigating the unfamiliar challenges of middle age.We expect most of you will laugh, some of you may cry, and all of you will be entertained.Who are we?Kindred Entertainment’s mandate is to bring professional, high quality, entertaining theatre to the people of Vancouver.

<h3>Welcoming who?</h3>
<p>My name is Alex Romania, I'm an interdisciplinary performing artist living and working in NYC. What does that mean? Well... I make strange things in a strange time. Right now I'm making a project called 'junkhead', which has come to be a reflection on a few years of being sick with something called Bartonella, an ugly bacteria you get from a tick bite which effects pretty much every part of your being (don't worry about my health, really, I'm in great health now and well on my way to even better health, but that experience has been a big influence on my art work ; ) I had Bartonella while I made my last work 'KLUTZ',  a massive piece in the historic Playhouse at Abrons Arts Center, involving 8 performers (my 75 year old father's performance debut) two musicians, a lighting designer, and a video designer. I didn't realize Bartonella flares up in stressful times - during that project I was experiencing symptoms I wasn't aware were due to this bacteria in my body. I'm now in good health, and I look back at that period feeling I was possessed by something strange. While sick I discovered a brilliant coping mechanism - horror / sci-fi cinema - some which I have come to appreciate as masterpieces, some which I thumb at as odd culture sores. I've been thinking a lot about what these horror films, contemporary media, my experience of being sick, and the suburban spaces I grew up in say in relation to one another. I've been in the studio collaborating with performers Maira Duarte and Malcolm-X Betts, composer Marc Mosteirin, interdisciplinary artist Max Abeles, and recently Hyung Seok Jeon who is helping me run a video installation for the performance. We've been creating in the messy terrain this project explores, and I'm raising money to pay these incredible artists for their time so that we can bring our work to life at Brooklyn Studios for Dance this May 1-4, 2019. </p>

<h3>Why welcome 'junkhead'?</h3>
<p>'junkhead' is a challenging work that looks at the pre-apocalyptic state of the 21st century, the behavior of governments, and the expression of capitalist/consumer economies as spaces of sickness. I'm also asking some personal questions in this work - like how an artistic work can hold up the maker, rather than press down on them? Seems sort of ironic to ask that question and create a 50lb silicone suit to dance inside of... but hey, that's art I guess. I could write the rest of my PR nonsense here like:</p>
<p><i>'Speech, video, sound, and action form a chaos meditation of thought memes contemplating the psychosis of governance as delusional capitalist suicidal ideation as egomaniacal death worship as parasitic zombie whiteness as the spacetime emoji continuum of mediareality loops of apocalypse nostalgia. junkhead is overload with hopes beyond the body (of)___________.'</i></p>
<p>You know, that kind of nonsense ; this work began as a reflection on my experiences of a mind altered space living with the effects this bacteria Bartonella, so, yeah, it's more than a little bit about that space where your grasp on reality starts to slide (again, I'm in good health now, so no need to worry ; ). I think this is a powerful work that has the potential to speak beyond my experience - I'm asking my collaborators to go on a challenging, vulnerable, and exhausting journey with me on stage and in the studio. Your contributions will go towards artist fees and material costs for bringing this project to it's full fruition, getting well deserved fees to well deserving artists. In my last project KLUTZ, I raised over $6,000 to meet the expenses of that project; I'm doing a smaller campaign this time as it's pretty soon after my last round of fundraising. A contribution of any size goes a long way and is deeply felt.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Stars of Tomorrow program was started in 2018 by Chandra Galloway. The show is completely student run, from the cast and crew, right up through the staff. She wanted to provide a space where students of all ages and all theatre backgrounds were able to learn and grow in their love of theatre. This program is not just for students who already have a background in theatre, it is also for those who want to learn more and explore that interest in their lives, whether they wish to be behind the scenes or onstage.</p>
<p>This campaign is not just so we can raise a little bit of money for our show, without this campaign our show may not be possible, and after watching the growth of all these students last year we just cannot let that happen.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting on a show is not cheap or easy. The money raised from this campaign will go directly towards paying for the royalties, scripts, and rehearsal fees. By donating you will receive a special gift from the cast, staff, and theatre company, starting with a thank you in our program and going up to you or your business/organization being recognized on all of our posters and other promotional items.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other ways to help:</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to donate money to our cause. We just ask that you spread the word and share this with your friends and family. </p>
<p>If you would like to donate an unspecified amount or want more information please contact Chandra Galloway at tctcstarsoftomorrow@gmail.com. </p>

She wanted to provide a space where students of all ages and all theatre backgrounds were able to learn and grow in their love of theatre. This program is not just for students who already have a background in theatre, it is also for those who want to learn more and explore that interest in their lives, whether they wish to be behind the scenes or onstage.
This campaign is not just so we can raise a little bit of money for our show, without this campaign our show may not be possible, and after watching the growth of all these students last year we just cannot let that happen.  

What We Need & What You Get
Putting on a show is not cheap or easy. The money raised from this campaign will go directly towards paying for the royalties, scripts, and rehearsal fees. By donating you will receive a special gift from the cast, staff, and theatre company, starting with a thank you in our program and going up to you or your business/organization being recognized on all of our posters and other promotional items.
 
Other ways to help:
We understand that not everyone is able to donate money to our cause. We just ask that you spread the word and share this with your friends and family. 
If you would like to donate an unspecified amount or want more information please contact Chandra Galloway at tctcstarsoftomorrow@gmail.com.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Master Sigh</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Shauna Sorensen and Dancers 2nd evening length performance </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Master Sigh</i> is a meeting of music, street art, and dance. The Top to Bottom mural, created by <a href=""http://www.artsorg.nyc/project/top-to-bottom/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arts Org</a>, is a public street art project located in the heart of Long Island City (LIC). Shauna Sorensen and Dancers have taken the first part of 2017 to research the murals and create 40 minutes of new movement inspired by several of the murals painted on the building. The company will perform this movement as well as present a site-specific dance video at our 2nd evening length performance on October 21st and 22nd at <a href=""http://thelocalny.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Local NY</a>.</p>
<p>The company was honored to receive the Queens Council on The Arts: New Works Grant for 2017. Master Sigh is made possible by the Queens Council on The Arts with public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council. Even with this generous grant, we still need to raise $798 to help us fund the filming process that Master Sigh requires. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To ensure we get the high quality filming we need for the site-specific dance video and to film the performance for archival purposes, the company needs to raise $798. <ul>
<li>$200 to pay filmmaker for filming at the murals </li>
<li>$82 to rent camera stabilizer equipment </li>
<li>$300 to pay filmmaker the day of the performance </li>

<li> Donate $50: free beer during after party at the Local NYC, personalized dance to be posted on social media, and Thank You email from all the dancers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will first go towards paying the filmmaker for filming at the murals and then to the camera stabilizing equipment; the remainder will go towards paying the dancers the day of the mural filming. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Projects such as the Top to Bottom mural bring together the diverse population of LIC, and educate all people - young and old, students and professionals - about the importance of urban art. By celebrating the Top to Bottom mural through dance, film, and sound, we will be drawing attention to this movement of public/private art right at our doorstep while bringing a bounty of beauty into the industrial, gritty streets of LIC.</p>
<p>Shauna Sorensen and Dancers premiered their first evening-length dance piece in the spring of 2015. This project was an amazing year and a half spent in the studio. The process of building movement, editing the piece after each performance, molding spatial patterns, and being involved in a long-term project was truly rewarding. We are honored to be given the opportunity to dive into that creation process again. Utilizing film will help push the company's creative limits and help create a thoughtful performance experience for the audience. With your donations to the campaign, the company will be able to make a quality dance video to show during our performance and will be given the opportunity to have excellent archival video to use for future submissions and performances. </p>

<p>Through the delicate intertwining of her memories, Lily explores the struggles that families face in moments of trauma and the fearless power of childhood innocence and imagination.</p>
<p>Following a well received twenty minute excerpt at Scene + Heard 2017, a full production was scheduled for May 1st-12th 2018. We have recently spent some time redeveloping the script based on the feedback we received after Scene + Heard and are ready to hit the stage!  </p>

</h3><p>Hello! My name is Francine
Odri and I am a Children’s Theatre Director at Mainstage’s Summer Stage program
in Blackwood, N.J. Summer Stage has been a Gloucester Township staple for 25
summers and we are very excited to celebrate our 26<sup>th</sup> year! Summer
Stage is truly a special and magical place. Here, we foster a safe and loving
environment that nurtures young performers to achieve their dreams. Many of our
staff members, myself included, have grown up through the program and love it
so much that we want to perpetuate that magic for further generations. </p>
<p>This summer, one of our
three shows is <i>Willy Wonka Jr.,</i> which
features a “Flying” scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe. In order to make this
production the best that it can be and the summer as magical as possible, we
are trying to bring Flying by Foy, the same company that flew Mary Martin in
the original <i>Peter Pan </i>musical, to
Summer Stage. Mainstage has worked with Flying by Foy in the past (most
recently in their production of <i>Peter Pan
</i>this past November), but money for the arts this summer is particularly
tight with three other shows to produce and we need your help!</p>
<p>We are in the process of
gaining sponsors to fund the bulk of Flying by Foy’s cost, but we are still a
bit below our goal. If we do not reach our entire goal, the funding will go to
enhancing the children’s experience in the show in whatever way possible,
including bubble machines and other additions to the set.</p>
<p>Last November, Mainstage
was successful in gaining funding to bring Flying by Foy to <i>Peter Pan</i> through a campaign similar to
this, so we are hopeful that we may reach our goal again! Please consider

<p>Capoeira Mestre Bimba Bay Area is excited to announce its first ever <i>batizado!</i>  We are raising funds to bring our Mestre
(teacher) from Brazil, along with other guest teachers from our worldwide<span> group. This fundraising effort will pay for travel
expenses, workshop fees, t-shirts, food and other costs that go into this significant
three-day event being held from June 4 to 6. </span></p><p><span>Our students have been working hard and they love capoeira. The batizado represents a recognition of their hard work and motivation to keep improving and moving forward in this art form. This event cannot happen without our teacher, Mestre Bamba: Mestre Bamba, who has been opening the door for hundreds of kids and adults in Bahia, Brazil, where social and economic disparity is tangible. Capoeira gives confidence, discipline, and self-value to these kids in need. It educates them about African Brazilian culture, about African Diaspora and provides a history lesson in every song and in every movement. Offering scholarships and teaching in poverish communities throughout the city of Salvador, Bahia, Mestre Bamba provides a hope for many and he is the reason we are here teaching today. </span></p>
<h1><strong>Our Story</strong></h1><p><strong>Capoeira Mestre Bimba Bay Area</strong> was started by Professor Caçador (Jadson Souza) and Estagiário Sereno (Helio
Conceição) in 2010. Both teachers trained under Mestre Bamba in
the historic neighborhood of Pelourinho, in Salvador, where Capoeira was born. After
teaching at the Associação de Capoeira Mestre Bimba, Jadson moved to the Bay
Area in 2010 where he started his local Capoeira practice giving lessons on a playground of a nearby elementary school. Next he joined the team at Destiny
Arts, a 25-year-old nonprofit that teaches violence-prevention through the arts to Bay Area<span> youth. Since working with Destiny Arts, Jadson has
taught in various elementary schools, dance studios and martial arts gyms. For
him, his most rewarding work was teaching Capoeira and music to developmentally
disabled adults at the Clausen House in Oakland. Jadson currently offers an
adult Capoeira program in Oakland, a children’s program in Alameda, and is part
of the city of San Pablo’s COPT (Childhood Obesity Prevention Task Force). In a
year, Jadson has taught over 50 kids in San Pablo, a city that has the 3rd highest rate of obesity in the state.  </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1355452/files/20150404144442-IMG_4827.jpg?1428183882"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Helio, who has been learning capoeira
since he was 5 years old—throwing kicks with his uncle beneath a mango tree—has
taken his training and brought it first to Traverse, Michigan, in 2007 where he
taught at Leelanau Center for Contemplative Arts. Beginning in 2010, Helio has
been teaching at various locations in the Bay Area. He now teaches weekly
classes at the Berkeley YMCA and was part of its outreach program to help keep
elementary school kids active. He also teaches at an alternative high school in
Oakland and has several adult classes throughout the Bay Area where he offers
scholarships for underprivileged teens and adults.<div>As African descendants, Jadson and Helio are aware that their work goes beyond teaching the movements of capoeira. Teaching in public schools and community centers in areas that are not so affluent, they represent leadership for minorities that don't normally see people like them in these roles. <br/><p></p>
<h1><b>What is Capoeira?</b></h1>
<p>Capoeira
is an African-Brazilian martial art with a foundation in dance, music, and
acrobatics. Developed around the 16<sup>th</sup> century, on the plantations
and <i>senzalas</i> (estates) of colonial
Brazil, Capoeira was born out of a desire of expression, a necessity of
freedom, and a means of survival for African-Brazilian men. Its roots stem from
the resistance of slavery and it has since evolved into an instrument of
social, educational, and cultural enrichment. Capoeira is a part of Brazil’s
identity and was recently declared a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of
Humanity. </p>

<h1>
<b>What is a Batizado?</b><br/>
</h1>
<p>A <i>batizado</i>
is a Capoeira ceremony where new students are symbolically introduced to the world-wide
Capoeira community and receive their first <i>cordos</i>
(belts). Other Capoeira Mestres, instructors and students are invited to the
ceremony, where they joyfully welcome new Capoeiristas (people that play
Capoeira) to the art form. As in many aspects of Capoeira, the <i>batizado</i> has its own symbolism and is a
very special event. It is not a competition but rather a weekend-long event filled
with community and activities where Capoeiristas share their knowledge and love
of this beautiful art form.</p>

I have an avid love of all things geek and pop-culture, and am especially a huge movie and music nerd. I thought a dance party would be a fitting tribute to a genius artist who was taken too soon.Since this is a last minute addition to the party rooms we are trying to raise the funds to help offset a majority of the costs associated with hosting a party at the convention.The more money we can raise the more amenities the room can offer. There's party room rental, sound equipment, decorating, and if we raise enough, possible drinks to offer.Rough budget breakdown (will be tweaked as we go)Cabana Room rental - $800Sound Equipment - $240Decorations - $100Additional funds past this will be used to add beverages, and other items we're considering.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

July 21-31, 2011 at The Drilling Co. Theatre, 236 West 78th Street, NY, NY

INTRODUCING Squeaky Bicycle Productions' premiere of two exciting new plays!

Reputation Control is an Equity Approved Showcase that asks the question: 
What truly defines us? How important is one's Reputation to who they are, and who they become? In the city that never sleeps, with millions of people vying to make their mark, we've all had to evaluate our place and position in this world. Reputation Control presents two plays that deal with this very question, a question that everyone struggles with, and a question that must be asked- Am I as I am perceived? 
THE PLAYS:
Feedback, by Jane Miller, is a play from our 2011 Winter Reading Lab now being presented as a full-production. Feedback is the story of Holly, a woman whose personal life and unrealized goals lead her to seek rebranding. What will Perceptions recommend so that Holly can reach her full market value?
AND
The Tragedie of Cardenio, by Ben Bartolone, award winner at the 2010 Midtown International Theater Festival.The Tragedie of Cardenio introduces us to Jeffrey Rome who has the life every aspiring celebrity writer dreams about: all of the fame and none of the respect. After finding Shakespeare's lost play, Jeffrey must choose between critical acclaim and something much bigger

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2011 7 Hills Improv sought to bring Chicago style Improv to Southwest Virginia. Using his Chicago Improv training Neal Tosi(Executive Director) held two workshops with Lynchburg College graduate Ashley Byrne to seek out company members. We found our ensemble and hit the road. Playing a bar here and there we rehearsed and perfected our team. As time went on we discovered that we had developed our own style that reflected our Virginia roots. A style influenced by the great Improv theaters of Chicago and Neal's training but with a look and feel all its own. As Neal went back to training in Chicago Beverly Owens stepped in as Director. Adding a style and flair all her own 7 Hills went on to start to play multiple venues and theater festivals. Continuing to break new ground 7 Hills has now expanded to cover in school workshops and performances.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>We impact Virginia in several ways. We draw in tourist, boost awareness of the arts in schools with no drama programs and elevate the learning experience of those with active drama departments, provide entertainment and education in the arts to our community and beyond, and give a theatrical outlet through Improv to Southwest Virginia. We see the possibilities of Improv as endless from flash mobs to our classic Improv shows. We hope to spread our unique style of comedy all over.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need MONEY! From costumes to rental fees keeping funny and current can be an expensive proposition. We are looking for a permanent space to rehearse, hold workshops, and perform. The money donated will go directly to helping to pay rent on a location, advertising materials for our Improv Education program, and basic set pieces and costumes.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>My Story</h3>
</div><div>        I'm a high school student. I worry about the same things other students of my age do, like turning in assignments on time, making friends, and getting along with my sibling. I also look forward to the same things other students do, such as time with friends and days off of school. However, everyone is unique, and has different interests. Mine is the circus.</div><div>         I was a gymnast for nine years, then discovered a circus camp where I lived. Through the camp, I gained a new passion, and later joined the youth troupe. Through performing with the troupe, I began to live and breathe circus. On average, I spend a total of 11-15 hours a week at the circus, whether it be rehearsing, training, performing, or teaching. Over the past couple of years, I have decided that I want to devote my life to it. It's gone beyond enjoyment, recreation, or even competition. I know that when I graduate high school in two years, I want to perform and teach- I would even love to earn a contract with Cirque du Soleil.</div><div>         Here's the problem: I've been chasing this dream for about four years now. Unfortunately, I don't have the resources around me to achieve my goal; There is no height in the ceilings, there are no tumble traks or harnesses, or spring floors. What I would really love to do is go to a school in Canada closely connected to Cirque Du Soleil, intensively train there for a couple of weeks, and gather the skills and knowledge I need to make my dream possible. However, a project like this is terribly expensive, and I need your help. </div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Simply put, if you donate to my cause, you help me to achieve my dreams. Everyone can be a dreamer, and if you are passionate enough about your dreams, they can come true. The circus is my passion, and I want to turn this into my life. Even if I don't make enough to cover the full cost of a trip to Montreal, I will be able to put whatever I make to good use. All of my proceeds will go towards training like this. If I don't reach my $1000 goal, and even if I only make under $100, I will be able to pay for one private session with an amazing instructor. And even that means the world to me. </div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p>My goal is to make $1000 by my sixteenth birthday on May 8th. The cost of the training in Montreal is $1530 in all, and I will try and supplement the rest of what I don't make on my own. The $1000 will get me:</p>
<p>- Housing in Montreal for two weeks</p>
<p>- Intensive training at an incredible circus school</p>
<p>- Food for two weeks</p>
<p>- A priceless experience, and the opportunity to chase my dreams</p>

<h3>Friends,</h3>
<p>Today, on my 29th birthday (June 30th!), the world gave to me:</p>
<p>1. Two flying waterbugs in my apartment.  Thank you New York.</p>
<p>2. An acceptance letter from the Middle East Youth Leadership Jam.  Thank you Middle East Jam screening committee!</p>
<p>3. An even-more-historic-than-Mubarak-times uprising in Egypt, which has restored my hope in the insistence of the Egyptian people to challenge fate, again and again, when it has been unkind.  Thank you, Egyptian people, for restoring my hope in what has otherwise been a bleak year, and for the birthday present!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Point number 3 has made me even more happy about point number 2.  It is now, more than ever, exciting to be meeting with other changemakers across the Middle East, and to have the opportunity to build bridges and communicate about the struggles and challenges facing our region.  I am thrilled to have applied and been accepted to this program, whose main purpose is to connect the dots of youth activism across the region. </p>
<p>The program takes place in Jordan, partly in Amman and partly in the Wadi Rum desert.</p>
<h3>How you can help.</h3>
<p>Alas, money does not grow on palm trees, though give the Egyptians enough time and they might figure that shit out.  Until then, I am in need of funds to make my participation in the program an actual reality, to cover the travel expenses and program fees.  Here is where, friends, your generosity and potential guilt for forgetting to call me on my birthday, if applicable, come in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Here is what I am hoping to fund:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Airfare to Jordan and back. (around $1,200)</li>
<li>Funds for the program itself. (up to $1,500)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am trying to raise $2,250 (after indiegogo fees, that actually comes out just over $2,000), which won't cover the entire cost of the program, but will BE AN ENORMOUS HELP.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Your contribution in any way is appreciated, whether it be fiscal or otherwise.  If you can't contribute by funding the campaign, feel free to share, get a rich uncle to donate in your stead, or to save up the amount you would have contributed and give it to me in hug-currency instead, the next time I see you.</p>

The scenes appear out of sequence and jump back and forth between one story and another. Sex and love. Some seek it, some need it, some spurn it and some pay for it, but we’re all involved in it.</p><p>There are two amazing stories on this play besides the one written. The first is how we actually got to make this play happen, and the second, how we got the venue where we are performing it.</p><p>First.</p><p>In 2010, I watched the movie “Scenes of a Sexual Nature.” I thought it would be a brilliant theater play, checked it out and found out it was an original script from Aschlin Ditta. I did my research and contacted his agent to ask for the rights of the play to adapt it to theater in Spanish, because my clout is stronger in Venezuela, which is my home country, Argentina, Colombia and Spain. That began almost two years of sending emails back and forth with no outcome. In 2012, very frustrated, I decided to look for Mr. Ditta himself via Twitter. I’ve been in the online marketing and social media industry for many years — that’s what I do. I found two Aschlin Dittas, one of whom happened to be the one, and within a day I had the development agreement in my hands. THANK YOU SOCIAL MEDIA! I adapted Ditta’s movie script into a play, and it was ready to be produced in 2013.</p><p>Last year my marketing agency, the Mini Agency, shifted to being a resource-based agency. That means we provide clients with our online marketing services, and they provide us with their resources. In some cases, money is another resource.</p><p>And here comes the second …</p><p>Second.</p><p>In June 2013, I started working with Teatro SEA as their marketing director, and the resource-based deal we worked out was for us to give them our services in exchange for two months a year in their theater. This new variable led me to readapt the play into English to produce it in New York City at SEA. Aschlin Ditta agreed, and voila!</p><p>Teatro SEA has an amazing three-year-old space in Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Pictures below!</p><h3>Why we are in Indiegogo?</h3><p>Producing this play has been a collaborative effort between actors, crew and production team. Because the theater is being paid with the Mini Agency’s services, we did not need money upfront to book the space, but like every production, we have expenses to cover.</p><p>As we strongly believe in the power of collaboration and the willingness of nice people, we believe there is nothing better than crowdfunding to go through this experience.</p><p>This play costs a lot more money than $6,000 to produce, but because of our deal, this is what we need to break even. This amount will be used to cover some of the production expenses, including scenery, salaries and marketing.</p><p>Our experiment is to show people that under the collaboration wing, we all win. When we started producing this play, we wanted to do an Equity Showcase — we found plenty of bureaucracy, money requirements and less-than-fair policies behind Equity’s protocol. So, because “life is about creating yourself,” we asked ourselves, “Can’t we do this by tapping into our networks? Is it possible to build a production supported by regular, everyday people and make our living out of it?” To all these questions, our answer was YES, and here we are. Every penny we make will be split among actors, crew and production team. We have created perks for every actor to encourage their friends and family to contribute to their craft.</p><h3>Expenses and Budget</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383500/files/20140220153031-piechart.jpg?1392939031"" src="""" style=""width: 422.35897435897436px; height: 261px;""/></p><p></p><h3>Cast</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383490/files/20140220151445-Cast.jpg?1392938085"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383492/files/20140220151517-cast__1_.jpg?1392938117"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3>The Stage</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383503/files/20140220153245-IMG_7049.JPG?1392939165"" src="""" style=""width: 404.64379947229554px; height: 270px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383505/files/20140220153345-IMG_7038.JPG?1392939225"" src="""" style=""width: 403.985559566787px; height: 269px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383507/files/20140220153407-IMG_7021.JPG?1392939247"" src="""" style=""width: 403.5px; height: 269px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383508/files/20140220153439-IMG_7013.JPG?1392939279"" src="""" style=""width: 406.1424802110818px; height: 271px;""/></p><br/><h3>Goals</h3><p>“Scenes of a Sexual Nature” has been a long and amazing process.

<p>The Wild Rumpus Theatre Development Group (TWR) is a not-for-profit New York based ensemble of professional artists and managers.

<p>In short: we don't seek to produce the plays we create. We do seek to take the necessary time (and often, it's a very long time) in the writer's room and rehearsal studio to incubate and build pieces from the ground-up through trial and a lot of errors. When, and only when, a piece has survived our rigorous development process will we present a ""blueprint"" version of the work to the public and our industry in the hopes that the product we have painstakingly developed will find a future life on the commercial or professional nonprofit stage.<br/></p>
<p>We obsess about our process so that, in time, the right people can obsess about our product. This is a very novel concept in the top-down, product-driven theater market that is NYC. It can work. It will work. In the short term, though, generosity is key.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are the fourteen of fourteen. We are—</p>
<p>Jared Allen, Tyler Alverson, Kate Conway, Colin Gardner, Emily Guernsey, Keith Hale, Katherine Jones, Caroline Klidonas, Winston Koone, Emily Merlin, Chet Norment, Emily Tryon, Victoria Webster, Kym Zlogar</p>
<p>...and we need your help. </p>
<h3>Why We Are Fundraising</h3>
<p>We work in a highly competitive industry. Come senior year, it is important for us to network with as many people in the professional performing arts world as possible. We are all in love with what we do, and passionate about our art. But to be able to continue to do what we love we must get the job first! We are raising money for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our public Senior Showcase on <b>November 15 and 16 </b>with invited industry professionals from the Southeast.</li>
<li>Our private sessions with invited professionals: A casting director and an agent from each coast: Los Angeles and New York City.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting up a show can be costly, but bringing in important people costs even more.  To bring in our four selected agents and casting directors, we will need $8,000. That's $2,000 a head, and well worth it. We will have face time with people that can help us begin a career in the big, scary real world. We will take classes and work intimately with these people, as well as perform our showcase material for them, providing us with an invaluable experience.</p>
<p>Please know that we are doing everything in our power to fundraise! We have been very lucky in our events so far, and have more events set up throughout the year. Here are some other ways we are fundraising:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit shares with local businesses</li>
<li>Car washes</li>
<li>Merchandise such as tumblers, t-shirts, and DRAMA sunglasses</li>
<li>Bakesales</li>
<li>Games such as Assassins</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">... and more!</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By raising enough money to reach our goal, we will be able to bring in two representatives in the performing arts business from each coast. This unique experience will allow us to have face time with, work with, and perform for industry professionals who can help us obtain jobs following graduation. In other words, are helping out the future Hollywood and Broadway stars of the next generation!</p>

<p>In June, a major flood devastated the city of Calgary. The Improv Guild, a not for profit theatre society, was caught in the middle of the disaster. Our home, the Impro Depot, was filled with river water for days leaving behind inches of thick, muddy sludge. Thanks to countless volunteers, we survived. But we sustained more than $20,000 in damages and losses. We are seeking financial support in the amount of $5,000. This amount will help cover the costs of rebuilding our studio and the replacement of assets essential to our programming. We’re not asking for the entirety of what we lost, just enough to get us back on our feet. Any help is truly appreciated.</p>
<p>This flood hit us at a really hard time. September marks our 10th anniversary as an organization. As a result we had been planning to significantly increase programming and celebrate the success of our small, hardworking arts organization. Because of this flood everything is up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking $5000 in support to help cover the costs of:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>Cleaning supplies, paint, drywall and building supplies</li>
<li>Ruined furniture such as couches, shelves and tables</li>
<li>The cost of 2 refrigerators that were lost</li>
<li>Ruined speakers and other electronic equipment</li>
<li>Replacement of props and costumes</li>
</ol><p>In return, we are offering the following perks depending on your level of support:</p>

<li>Invitation to volunteer and donor appreciation show</li>
<li>Free tickets to Boardwalk Calgary Improv Festival</li>
<li>A plaque on our studio wall with your name on it</li>
</ol><p>If we do not meet our fundraising goal any donations will still be used as outlined above.</p>
<p>Be a flood angel. Even $10 will go a long way to help.</p>
<p><strong>Why this Campaign is Important</strong></p>
<p>In 2003 the Improv Guild formed as a small grassroots artists cooperative. At the heart of the organisation are the ideals of support, creativity and community. Years later these ideals are still essential to our operation but our reach has grown. We produce the Boardwalk Calgary Improv Festival, which brings performers from all over the globe to Calgary. Hundreds of students have gone through our improv school. We also now have a strong youth component to our company, having produced an annual high school improv championship for the last two years as well. But all of this programming centres around our home, a humble studio at 2405 MacLeod Tr. S which was innondated by the water of the Elbow river.</p>

<h3 class=""p1"">WHY <em>THE PAVILION</em>?</h3>
<p class=""p1""><strong><em>The Pavilion</em></strong> is a contemporary play from renowned writer <strong>CRAIG</strong> <strong>WRIGHT</strong> (<em>Recent Tragic Events), </em>about <strong>TIME</strong>, from the beginning of the Universe all the way to the individual minutes of each persons life. <em>The Pavilion</em> is a play about maturation and regret, as two battle-weary individuals wonder if it's possible to erase their scars.</p>
<p><span class=""font_8""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The play tells the story of <strong>Peter</strong> (Wilson Murphy) and <strong>Kari</strong> (Kelsey Secules), former high school flames whose relationship ended sourly when Peter coldly walked out on Kari upon learning that she was pregnant. The two meet decades later at their high school reunion, and Peter has one night to confront his past.  The curious and powerful <strong>Narrator</strong> (Matthew Schott) leads the confused couple on an unforgettable evening.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p3"">We chose to present <em>The Pavilion</em> as our first show because Wright's simple storytelling conceit let us focus our attention on exploring the magnetic language of the script. We love this script. As young artists exploring our own maturity and growth over the last few years, we can relate to the driving force to right past wrongs (can't everybody?).  </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am sixteen and I have been dancing since I was ten years old. I got a late start (most dancers start when they're three) but I caught on quickly and became passionate about pursuing a career in dance. I worked extremely hard (you'd know if you saw my feet) and excelled greatly in a short amount of time. </p>
<p>The moment I knew I wanted to have a career in dance came when I was 15 years old. I injured my foot and was unable to dance for five months. It was torture. When I finally healed, I decided that I never wanted there to be a day in my life where I didn't dance. It is part of who I am and I never want to lose that.</p>
<h3>What I'm Asking</h3>
<p>I would appreciate your help in raising funds to help me attend the American Dance Festival. It is a six week summer dance intensive that I feel is valuable to my growth as a dancer. It is intensive enough to make up for the few years I lost before I started dancing, and the five months I lost while I was injured. It will also help me make connections in the dance world. This program will help my growth as a person, as an dancer, and as an artist.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The entire intensive, tuition and room/board, costs approx. $3200. I am only asking for $1600 here, half the cost, but I appreciate all I can get. I auditioned for a scholarship which I am hoping will help cover the rest. I need some help raising money to meet the expenses. I cannot afford it without your help. I appreciate any donation, however small. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without this $1600, I will not be able to attend this program and it will be difficult to find this training somewhere else; it is impossible to find such a high level program at a lower cost. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially to my campaign, please sprend the word. That will help me reach more potential donors. Thank you.</p>

This program will help my growth as a person, as an dancer, and as an artist.


What I Need
The entire intensive, tuition and room/board, costs approx. $3200. I am only asking for $1600 here, half the cost, but I appreciate all I can get. I auditioned for a scholarship which I am hoping will help cover the rest. I need some help raising money to meet the expenses. I cannot afford it without your help. I appreciate any donation, however small. 


The Impact
Without this $1600, I will not be able to attend this program and it will be difficult to find this training somewhere else; it is impossible to find such a high level program at a lower cost. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute financially to my campaign, please sprend the word. That will help me reach more potential donors. Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>WHY WE EXPERIENCED A FUNDING SHORTFALL AT THE LAST MINUTE</strong></p>
<p>The idea of bringing these shows to Ireland was first suggested by the late Gordon Campbell whose independent arts organization, The Academy of Everything is Possible had agreed to underwrite that visit in part.  Sadly, Mr. Campbell passed in early June, after the theatre, plane tickets etc had been booked.  With no clear provision left with his estate, Farrell now finds himself well short of the funds needed to realise this project.</p>
<p>Despite having already raised $4,000, we are still experiencing a shortfall critical shortfall - the gap created by the sudden death of our sponsor.  Raising this $1500 will go a long way towards closing that gap!</p>
<p><strong>HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT</strong></p>
<p>The  $1500 here would be used to cover related transport, printing and production costs, as well as a few meals for the crew (all of whom have agreed to pitch in pro bono in light of the immediate crisis.)  No one is expecting to make any money on this tour, so your assist here will go a long way to augmenting the Box Office and keeping the producers as out of the red as possible.</p>
<p><strong>THE PERKS</strong></p>
<p>Our perks are all reasonably priced and will allow each supporter to experience the show either alive on opening night or on video, after the fact.  The most modestly priced perk ($4) is like buying a coffee at the interval - a small one at that!</p>
<p><strong>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN MATTERS</strong></p>
<p> These two one acts (Walt Whitman in Ireland and 3 Lies About Brooklyn) need to be seen in Ireland.  The first because it affirms the unique inspiration Whitman’s poetry gave to the nationalist struggle:  that it was Ireland that fully embraced Whitman’s conviction that democracy was a moral necessity.  That contribution has been neglected due to the efforts of Lady Gregory and WB Yeats to corrupt the original ambitions of the Irish Literary Revival (which was a forward looking and revolutionary campaign) into one of dreamy nostalgia and fairy tales.</p>
<p>The second,  (3 Lies) because the continuing upheaval caused by the revelations of the Ryan Report have made the Magdalene Laundries the subject of theatre and film but never has the story been told from the POV of one of the children who was smuggled abroad and whose identity was erased.</p>

<p>Farrell is well known to his peers as a pro-active artist, forceful and committed to seeing the projects he starts followed through on and realized.  The original Walt Whitman project at Dixon Place last year (Amorous Wet) of which Walt Whitman in Ireland is built upon, was the result of a successful Kickstarter campaign.  His decision to use Indiegogo is because of its more flexible, user-friendly platform, it’s international reach and the fact that this event is not solely dependent on reaching the target sum (though it “would be sweet” if it did.)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Resurrection Theatre has been producing quality community theater on a shoestring budget for three years, and honestly, that's just the way we like it. Without big budget sets or technical effects we are able to focus on the heart of each show and the connection it can form for the audience communally.  And, to toot our own horn, we consistently produce 4- and 5-star shows like <em>An Adult Evening of Shel Silverstein,</em> <em>Gruesome Playground Injuries, </em>and <em>Next Fall</em>. But we're hungry for more. From our producers to our volunteer directors, designers, stage crews, and actors, Resurrection Theatre is here  for the love of the art, and we'd like to take our little Theatre Company That Can to a new level, and we need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Why are we asking for $5,500?</p>
<p>Facility Rental and Script Royalties -- No matter how big or small the production,  rent and royalties are always a concern. Meeting our funding goal will make a big dent in that department and allow us to focus more of our resources on bringing you wonderful productions.</p>
<p>Ticket Pricing -- Have you noticed the $5-10 jump in everybody's prices this season? Being able to cover those fixed costs mentioned above without having to worry about making it all up in ticket sales allows us to keep our ticket prices down. Really, donating $5 or $10 now is going to save you $50 in the long run! </p>
<p>501(c)(3) Non-Profit Registration --  We want your future donations to Resurrection Theatre to be tax deductible! Part of the money we raise during this campaign will be used to pay the filing fee for our 501 (c) (3) application.</p>
<p>Expanding Horizons -- While our vision as a company is that shoestring budgets can yield some amazingly creative and moving stories, sometimes our directors have grand visions which need a grander budget. You would be helping those visions come to life. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We’ve all done it. We have all stood back after seeing something wonderful produced. We have all observed, and pondered, and wished. We have uttered the phrase: “I wish I could do that.”</p>
<p class=""Body1"">It is the belief of this company, this family of creative explorers, that art, story, and the general wonder of theatre is not solely upon the shoulders of one person. The wonder of theatre is created by a band of artists. Some see the spotlight and receive accolades and glory. Others operate out of sight, appreciated by those close to the art, but rarely acknowledged by the general audience. All of these people, be they technician or designer or actor...they are all producers. Their efforts bring about the stories told, they produce the breathless moment that we all sit and share. Those people are listed in the programs you hold. You can read their names. Their names in that small booklet proclaim: “I helped to make this moment” </p>

<p class=""p1"">All the money we make from this campaign will go straight towards the development of our production in Edinburgh. As these shows are not cheap we need as much funding as possible to enable us to be successfull in our endevour to create a new genre of theatre.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>About Us</strong>:</p>
<p class=""p1"">BigMix are a Leicester based performance troupe that come from a wide range of backgrounds, with a range of skills that allows for a very unique theatrical experience. The core team consists of experts in performing arts and digital media, including designers, an animator, software programmers, a theatrical director, a lighting designer and teachers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The key principle for the troupe is the need to entertain, inspire and educate. We hope to achieve this in our work by combining traditional theatre with the emerging digital technologies that more and more form a part of our everyday lives.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As a company we class ourselves as amateur as no one is paid for the work they do on the production, but we are able to bring our own work experiences together to develop productions and innovative ideas we are all passionate about.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=""p1"">Following on from the success of our first performance in Edinburgh 2012, for our second group project we want to carry on the research and development of looking into ways to integrate digital art into an existing story. The focus will be on ways that use visual art, music and programming to draw out elements of the narrative, and support the director and actors in the delivery of the performance.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Our aim is to produce a performance that is as accessible as possible to a wide age range of audiences by introducing new opportunities and ideas to the world of theatre. By adapting the story of Red Riding Hood into a script for the stage we will have a strong story line that allows us to be flexible in what we visually create and in doing so be able to produce a great performance with the use of the technology and skills we find most exciting.</p>

Bellini and the Sultan is a unique, full-length adventure-comedy (non-musical) that explores how Muslims and non-Muslims can communicate and understand one another’s cultures, in the context of an exciting entertainment experience.The appealing and complex central character, Renaissance painter Gentile Bellini, is sent to paint a famous portrait of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He finds himself fighting to survive in exotic 15th Century Istanbul in the midst of eunuchs, concubines, romance, executions and an evil Vizier out to get him.A multi-ethnic, multi-racial cast brings the story to life using minimal set, costumes and technicalrequirements, employing age-old theater craft and vivid characterizations.Mario Fratti, author of NINE and reviewer for AmericaOggi, called the play an “Exciting interpretation of an unusual encounter between art and politics.”
Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?


What We Need & What You Get
In order to put this productions up on stage with a proper set and costumes we will need to raise $2500. 
It is a unique experience and you will meet East and West in Istanbul and experience that era with the set and the costumes. 
The funds will help pay for the set and the costumes and the actors stipends. 


The Impact
It is an unusual original project that everyone will want to see. We are planning on taking the show to tour in the USA and Turkey.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><em>Sometimes I Laugh Like My Sister</em> (SILLMS) is a solo piece of theatre about a BBC producer, Kate Peyton, who was based in Johannesburg when she was sent to report on the situation in Mogadishu, where she was killed. The play is performed by Kate's sister, the actress Rebecca Peyton who co-wrote the piece with director Martin Bartelt. It is a passionately political, sharply comical and painfully personal account of life after Kate as is a performance in which movement, gesture and voice are all equal in importance and merge together. </p>
<p>This is a story about politics, journalists and death, told through the eyes of Rebecca, whose sister was stolen from her by faceless gunmen with no compunction about shooting a non-combatant in the back. It’s about politics, racism, migration, women’s rights and censorship; it’s about drinking yourself silly so that you can dance with abandon even as grief consumes every element of your personality. It's about leaving the house looking like you've been run over by a tractor, deciding <em>not</em> to have a drink for breakfast, press freedom and human rights. </p>
<p>It is a one-woman show where Rebecca talks to the audience directly, with a stage design which is limited to a chair, a table and some water to drink during the performance. Out of 27 performances at the Edinburgh Fringe, only one left Rebecca free to leave straight after the show, after the other 26 one or more - often more - people wanted to spend time with Martin and Rebecca, asking questions, telling their stories, just being together. The show allows talk and sharing in a way which is beyond our wildest hopes but which is inspiring and important.</p>
<p>Vital Digression and Obviam Est are taking the show to South Africa, where Kate lived and worked for the last ten years of her life. We can take this show anywhere and everywhere including church halls, community centres, schools, universities, shebeens, anywhere and everywhere people might like to see the show, and where we can talk and be together afterwards.  We do not want to be restricted by the wealth of any given audience, but this means we need to find the money to make the tour work from other avenues, and in a short space of time. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking around $10,000 or £6,000 financial support to assist with accommodation, travel and food, as well as associated costs with taking the show to less conventional performance spaces. At present Rebecca, Martin and Jacques are donating their fees so all of the money will go towards the production.</p>
<p>The actual production costs are very minimal as the show has very simple staging and lighting. We have found a lot of interest from people in all regions in having the show, and there has already been some media interest. However many venues are unable to provide these costs mentioned above, and so the support we are looking for is really to enable the company to stay on in South Africa and do as many performances as we can. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Performing the show where Kate lived and worked has been a long-term aim. We want to share the story, and explore the issues it raises, with audiences in the country she loved so much.</p>

<p><em>Resurrection, or the Terrible Repercussions of Making Tangible the Intangible</em> is a new one-act play by Jonathan Fitts.</p>
<p>Two years after graduating from college, Juan shows up at the doorstep of his could-have-been soul mate Lisa, only to find her barely recognizable and involved with Neil, the fiercely territorial, corrosive frontman of a death metal band who's determined to run Juan out.  What begins as a friendly, weekend visit quickly spirals into a dark, twisted, life-changing series of events where each individual must ask at what point they can no longer affect change.</p>

<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong> to the more than 180 individuals who have already generously donated to our State Park renovation campaign enabling us to reach our stretch goal of $12,500! This should allow us to install badly needed air conditioning in our State Park. If we can manage to hit $15,000 before our campaign ends - we might even be able to talk about those <em>bathrooms</em>...</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>""Partner, lemme upgrade u."" *</strong></p>
<p>The Neo-Futurists create meaningful artistic programming for the Chicago community on a weekly basis. We are known for producing the longest running show in Chicago theater history: <em>Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind (30 Plays in 60 Minutes).</em> Since 1988, we’ve written and produced 8,400 World Premiere short plays for 500,000 audience members . . . and counting. On top of that, we’ve created over 60 World Premiere full-length plays, such as this summer’s <em>Miss Neo Pageant </em>and 2011’s <em>Burning Bluebeard.</em> And our education programs, exploring the aesthetic of Neo-Futurism, have served 1,000+ students. For the last 20 years all of that work has been created, rehearsed, taught and performed in our theater on the corner of Foster &amp; Ashland.</p>
<p>Our point? A lot of people walk in and out of our space. We love working here, you love spending time here, and we all want to be here for a long time. So we’ve decided on an upgrade. For our ensemble, our students, and our audience. We’ve all earned it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>“Lemme introduce you to some new things.” *</strong></p>
<p>We're raising money to make some facility upgrades to our space, which includes the Theater, State Park and bathrooms. These improvements will offer heightened comfort and functionality for anyone who experiences our theater and our work.</p>
<p>WISH LIST:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Refurbished floors </strong>for the State Park.</li>
<li>
<strong>Focusable lighting </strong>for the State Park.</li>
<li>
<strong>New furnace to heat both </strong>the State Park and the Theater.</li>
<li>
<strong>Clean drywall </strong>in the State Park, offering a system to hang visual art, production information and company history.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound dampening</strong> <strong>on the walls,</strong> ideal for when we have workshops and rehearsals going on at the same time.</li>
<li>
<strong>New speakers </strong>for the Theater, and refurbishing the current set to serve the State Park.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sparkly new tile and fixtures </strong>for the bathrooms.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pivoting projector </strong>that can be focused on any wall in the State Park.</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage space </strong>for sets &amp; props.</li>
<li>
<strong>New digital photobooth </strong>to entertain as you wait for the show to start.</li>
<li>
<strong>Room divider</strong> in the State Park, allowing two rehearsals or workshops simultaneously.</li>
<li>
<strong>New A/C system </strong>for the State Park.</li>
</ul><p>So what does all of this do?</p>
<p>Suddenly our space is activated, in useful and purposeful ways. New floors and walls offer a clean place to work, learn and experience. Track lighting provides ways to inform our audiences of upcoming productions, or to showcase visual art by our ensemble or artistic affiliates. Quality speakers let us turn it to “11,” and let you hear it at “11.” HVAC heats up our winters, and cools down our summers. Essentially, things get better.</p>

<p>We need your help to make this revitalization of our space a reality, and to make <em>a more functional and comfortable venue in which</em> <em>to create and experience our work.</em></p>
<p>Our base goal for this campaign is <strong>$10,000</strong>. This covers all our essential needs: new drywall, ceiling and lighting for the State Park. Also installation of the furnace to provide sufficient heat in the winter.</p>
<p>Our stretch goal is <strong>$15,000</strong>. In addition to our base goals, the State Park floors get a makeover, and we buy new speakers for the Theater.</p>
<p>Our dream goal is <strong>$20,000.</strong> This allows everything mentioned above and green-lights full A/C installation in the State Park and a comfortable venue for the next 500,000 audience members who participate with our work.</p>
<p>If we raise over $20,000 we can also give our bathrooms a full makeover with new tile and fixtures.</p>

<p>En résumé, pendant une heure et sept minutes, assistée d’objets qui bougent, Gabie vous raconte son histoire. L’histoire d’une petite fille différente, d’une mère sans yeux morte de tristesse, d’une grand-mère excentrique jardinière de mots-réconforts, d’un répondeur acharné et d’un invité en retard.</p>

Aujourd’hui c’est une journée très spéciale, elle a invité Martin du Club Vidéotron à souper. Ce soir ils vont se marier, faire l’amour pour la première fois, avoir des bébés et ensuite s’aimer toute leur vie. Tout ça en mangeant du Kraft Dinner. 
En résumé, pendant une heure et sept minutes, assistée d’objets qui bougent, Gabie vous raconte son histoire. L’histoire d’une petite fille différente, d’une mère sans yeux morte de tristesse, d’une grand-mère excentrique jardinière de mots-réconforts, d’un répondeur acharné et d’un invité en retard.

<p>So we sent it in to the Massachusetts Educational Theatre Guild's ""Sherwood Collins Playwriting Contest"" on a whim, mostly because the contest had sent us an email and we were really excited about what we had done.

<p>And yet somehow <b>it won first place</b>. When we received the call, we had honestly forgotten we'd sent it in, and it probably the best surprise either of us had ever received.

The performance went better than we had ever hoped, and for better or for worse (we hope for better), we got a taste for it. </p>
<p>We realized it wasn't enough. What we realized from that tiny taste of performance was that it was fun. It was a fun show. Really fun. Fun for the actors, for the director, for the writers, and most importantly, <b>fun for the audience</b>. Too fun to abandon where it was, before it had ever been produced in its entirety. </p>

<p><b>SILENT
VOICES: A Play and Advocacy for War Crimes Victims' Rights Project</b></p>
<p>Silent Voices is a play
and advocacy for justice project that reveals and witnesses the terror

including children, enhancing victims’ healing process and empowerment to take
action to improve current policies affecting their lives.  </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453611/files/20140323074857-SV6.jpg?1395586137"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>PROJECT
SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>Written by renowned Ugandan playwright, Judith Adong and partly
developed at the Sundance Theater Lab, the play is based on interviews with
victims of the 20-year conflict between the Ugandan Government and the Notorious
Joseph Kony and his LRA Rebel forces in Northern Uganda. It mirrors the views and emotions of actual victims of the
Northern Uganda war (which do relate in many ways to the victims of the Rwanda
genocide and the Kenyan’s post-election violence). The project explores how
victims have been ignored in the constant calls to “forgive” and “reconcile” at
the expense of justice. Through the protagonist, (Mother – a symbolic
representation of life and death) <em><span>Silent
Voices</span></em> examines what good citizens can be driven into by unhealthy
policies. Coupled in a two-frontier approach, play production and advocacy; the
project gives the victims a platform and voice to express themselves.</p>
<p><b>WHO IS JUDITH ADONG</b></p>
<p>Judith Adong is a renowned Ugandan playwright and filmmaker
currently on a Fulbright Fellowship at Temple University in Philadelphia. Prior
to her current study, she was a professor at Makerere University in Kampala,
where she taught writing and film studies. Judith was a writer in residence
with Sundance Institute, where she development “Silent Voices” and the Royal
Court Theater, where she developed her play “Just Me, You and THE SILENCE,”
which explores the impact of Uganda’s harsh anti-homosexuality laws on one
family. The play received a gala benefit reading in 2012 at the Old Vic Theatre
in London, thanks to Kevin Spacey generous invite to Judy to share her play
with an audience of over 1,000 Londoners. Judith’s plays have also featured in
New York at the National Black Theater, The Signature Theater, and The New
Black Fest among others.</p>
<p><b>SILENT VOICES INSPIRATIONAL JOURNEY</b></p>
<p><i>In the words of the playwright, Judith Adong, </i></p>
<p>As an Acholi woman born and raised in this
region, I was one of the young people who walked every evening to spend the
night at the infamous Gulu bus park referenced in the viral “KONY 2012” video.
I attended the high school from which 44 girls were abducted by Joseph Kony and
his LRA rebels. These horrifying events are deeply personal to me, and yet I
was fortunate: due to miracle of a chance, I was able to leave war-ravaged Gulu
for college and thereafter work in Kampala. As a result, I knew only the
feeling of terror, but was not aware of the bitterness, betrayal and injustice
that so many Acholi survivors feel towards local and national government
leaders.</p>
<p>Between 2007- 2010, I returned to Gulu and
began to interview the men, women and children who survived Kony’s reign of
terror. I visited rehabilitation centers for child soldiers in Gulu to study
how theater was being used in the psychosocial therapy of the children who
filled the ranks of Kony’s army, one of the largest child armies in human
history. I also listened to the anger and frustration expressed by victims
about the Amnesty Act, which they felt ‘rewarded’ perpetrators for confessing
to often heinous crimes. So rather than write a research thesis that would
gather dust on the shelves of Makerere University Library, I felt so strongly
that these stories – these war-weary yet defiant voices – needed to be heard
and witnessed by the world.</p>
<p>This is why I wrote <i>Silent Voices</i>. The title isn’t a reference to the people of
Northern Uganda, whose voices are powerful, raw and stunning. Rather, it speaks
to the repressive silencing these victims feel that their government is forcing
on them in the name of forgiveness.” </p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Developed at the Sundance Theater Lab, <i>Silent Voices</i> had its world premiere at
the National Theater of Uganda in 2012. This production brought victims,
political, religious and cultural leaders, members of the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leaders together for critical, transformative
conversations about the compensation of victims and the National Peace and
Reconciliation Bill.<span>  For many in the
Kampala audience, the atrocities in Gulu were unfamiliar and shocking. It was
stunning to realize that so many in southern Uganda were oblivious to the
horrors taking place in the north. While this performance was a huge critical
success, playing to sold-out audiences, few victims had the opportunity to view
the play or contribute to this discussion.</span></p>
<p>We would like to continue this discussions
and advocacy giving a platform to more voices from Northern Uganda!</p>
<p><b>OUR NEED</b></p>
<p><b>However,
the play has yet to reach the majority of victims of the atrocities.</b><span>  </span></p>

SILENT
VOICES: A Play and Advocacy for War Crimes Victims' Rights Project
Silent Voices is a play
and advocacy for justice project that reveals and witnesses the terror
experienced by countless victims of the 20-year conflict in Northern Uganda,
including children, enhancing victims’ healing process and empowerment to take
action to improve current policies affecting their lives.  

PROJECT
SUMMARY
Written by renowned Ugandan playwright, Judith Adong and partly
developed at the Sundance Theater Lab, the play is based on interviews with
victims of the 20-year conflict between the Ugandan Government and the Notorious
Joseph Kony and his LRA Rebel forces in Northern Uganda. It mirrors the views and emotions of actual victims of the
Northern Uganda war (which do relate in many ways to the victims of the Rwanda
genocide and the Kenyan’s post-election violence). The project explores how
victims have been ignored in the constant calls to “forgive” and “reconcile” at
the expense of justice. Through the protagonist, (Mother – a symbolic
representation of life and death) Silent
Voices examines what good citizens can be driven into by unhealthy
policies. Coupled in a two-frontier approach, play production and advocacy; the
project gives the victims a platform and voice to express themselves.
WHO IS JUDITH ADONG
Judith Adong is a renowned Ugandan playwright and filmmaker
currently on a Fulbright Fellowship at Temple University in Philadelphia. Prior
to her current study, she was a professor at Makerere University in Kampala,
where she taught writing and film studies. Judith was a writer in residence
with Sundance Institute, where she development “Silent Voices” and the Royal
Court Theater, where she developed her play “Just Me, You and THE SILENCE,”
which explores the impact of Uganda’s harsh anti-homosexuality laws on one
family. The play received a gala benefit reading in 2012 at the Old Vic Theatre
in London, thanks to Kevin Spacey generous invite to Judy to share her play
with an audience of over 1,000 Londoners. Judith’s plays have also featured in
New York at the National Black Theater, The Signature Theater, and The New
Black Fest among others.
SILENT VOICES INSPIRATIONAL JOURNEY
In the words of the playwright, Judith Adong, 
As an Acholi woman born and raised in this
region, I was one of the young people who walked every evening to spend the
night at the infamous Gulu bus park referenced in the viral “KONY 2012” video.
I attended the high school from which 44 girls were abducted by Joseph Kony and
his LRA rebels. These horrifying events are deeply personal to me, and yet I
was fortunate: due to miracle of a chance, I was able to leave war-ravaged Gulu
for college and thereafter work in Kampala. As a result, I knew only the
feeling of terror, but was not aware of the bitterness, betrayal and injustice
that so many Acholi survivors feel towards local and national government
leaders.
Between 2007- 2010, I returned to Gulu and
began to interview the men, women and children who survived Kony’s reign of
terror. I visited rehabilitation centers for child soldiers in Gulu to study
how theater was being used in the psychosocial therapy of the children who
filled the ranks of Kony’s army, one of the largest child armies in human
history. I also listened to the anger and frustration expressed by victims
about the Amnesty Act, which they felt ‘rewarded’ perpetrators for confessing
to often heinous crimes. So rather than write a research thesis that would
gather dust on the shelves of Makerere University Library, I felt so strongly
that these stories – these war-weary yet defiant voices – needed to be heard
and witnessed by the world.
This is why I wrote Silent Voices. The title isn’t a reference to the people of
Northern Uganda, whose voices are powerful, raw and stunning. Rather, it speaks
to the repressive silencing these victims feel that their government is forcing
on them in the name of forgiveness.” 
THE IMPACT
Developed at the Sundance Theater Lab, Silent Voices had its world premiere at
the National Theater of Uganda in 2012. This production brought victims,
political, religious and cultural leaders, members of the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leaders together for critical, transformative
conversations about the compensation of victims and the National Peace and
Reconciliation Bill.  For many in the
Kampala audience, the atrocities in Gulu were unfamiliar and shocking. It was
stunning to realize that so many in southern Uganda were oblivious to the
horrors taking place in the north. While this performance was a huge critical
success, playing to sold-out audiences, few victims had the opportunity to view
the play or contribute to this discussion.
We would like to continue this discussions
and advocacy giving a platform to more voices from Northern Uganda!
OUR NEED
However,
the play has yet to reach the majority of victims of the atrocities.  
We are calling on you to help us
take this production directly to the people of the Northern Uganda
communities in Gulu, Lira, and Kitgum – in the Luo
language of the area – and involve them in community discussions and other
programming.  
Your support will help us cover the costs of: live play
production and advocacy talk back sessions in four cities of Uganda, play book
publication of the play both in English and Luo language and a live video
recording of the production. Through these activities, we will be able to expand
the immediate impact of the play, empower more people to become advocates on
this issue, and provide them with confidence in their voice in speaking up for
their human rights.
We are looking to raise $50,000 that will
enable us to tour the production. These funds will help cover all production
costs, including nine touring performances in Gulu, Kitgum, and Lira, and six
performances in Kampala. All shows will include a structured, moderated
discussion in which audience members will engage their leaders and offer
feedback to in the National Peace and Reconciliation process.  This budget also includes a high quality
video recording of the performance, so that the story can be shared far and
wide through the popular DVD market in Uganda and other African nations.

There are many things that must not be forgotten, although, inevitably our memories gradually fade away year by year. We believe this story embraces many still-relevant  themes such as state of authority, war and mass media, racism, sexism; themes that should be revisited generation after generation.
<p>Stage is to regain the lost and labelled voices, a ritual of channeling through the devices of theater and the living flesh of human beings. Theatre can only recall voices to the limited spaces of the proscenium. However, the value of going to the land, the place where these voices once existed through this particular art form is immeasurable.</p>
<p>2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth as well as 10 years since the death of Iva Toguri D’Aquino, the source of inspiration for this story. Japanese-Americans who were subjected to internment camps lived in silence about their experiences in order to survive post-war life as Americans. We have learned the importance of redressing the past over time, even with its difficulties, from Iva Toguri D’Aquino and, most recently, from the devastation of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. And the time has come where we cannot turn a blind eye to the increasing tensions arising between neighboring countries on every continent, a disturbing echo of the past.  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1022395/files/20141117072440-ZHCF_arasuji.jpg?1416237880"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1022436/files/20141117074311-ZHCF_arasuji_image.jpg?1416238991"" src="""" style=""""/></p>“Zero Hour” is the name of the radio program that broadcasted propaganda by the Japanese government to the Americans during WWII. The alluring voices of female announcers, brought to the soldiers fighting in the South Pacific, were initially dubbed ‘oriental witch’,  eventually becoming “Tokyo Rose”.  After the war, American soldiers and journalists flooded the ruins of Tokyo to lay their eyes on her.
<p>These were women of Japanese descent who began as typists, dictating foreign short-wave before becoming announcers, broadcasting propaganda to American soldiers at sea; “Orphans in the Pacific.” They worked out of an isolated broadcasting studio, most of them far from their homeland. As such, they were also ‘orphans in the pacific’ themselves. The announcers were considered as enemies; whose own voices were sealed and before long, were accused as traitors by their own country, disappearing in the waves of history.</p>

In the world of set, costume and projection, voices of women are heard in various states, drifting between truth and falsehood, through the use of electronic amplification, radio technology, and in its natural state. Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tape was premiered in 2013 at KAAT(Kanagawa Arts Theatre) and AICHI TRIENNALE 2013 receiving rave reviews. Through invitation and support by Japan Society, we are now able to bring this story to North America, including California where this story takes place, with a new cast and script for an English-speaking audience.<p></p>

Her father, Jun, from Yamanashi, Japan, was manager of a general store that sold imported goods. Her mother, Fumi, originally from Tokyo, was a 2nd generation Japanese-American. In 1941, Iva travelled to her parents’ homeland of Japan to visit her sick aunt. Shortly after, WWII broke out and she lost her chance to go home. (Her mother died of illness en route to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans.)</p>
<p>Iva got a job at Radio Tokyo to contrive her living. She was selected to be an announcer, quickly becoming popular among American soldiers. While many female Japanese announcers revoked their American citizenship under pressure from Japanese authorities, Iva, with her strong patriotism, protected her American citizenship to the end. However, Japan’s defeat marked the beginning of Iva’s tragedy.  She was the first woman in American history to be found guilty of treason, charged and convicted of being an American supporting the propaganda broadcasting of enemies. She was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment with revocation of her American citizenship.</p>
<p>In 1970s, the validity of her verdict was brought under public scrutiny to be reconsidered.  Further inquiry revealed that the trial was beleaguered with systemic racism and the prejudice of the times, including an all-white jury, coupled with a conspiracy theory of Tom C. Clark, the attorney general under the Truman administration. In 1979, two witnesses from the trial, Iva’s former superior authorities, confessed; “The testimony was not based on facts but fabricated and forced by FBI.” In 1977, President Ford gave Iva a full pardon and reinstated her American citizenship.</p>

Noted former imprisoners include George Hasato Takei Altman and Isamu Noguchi. After the war, Japanese-Americans were denied their rightful citizenship, for the sole reason of having ancestral roots in America’s former enemy. It was not until June of 1952 that the Walter Emigrant Naturalization law was administered. In the beginning, German and Italian immigrants were also interned, but were soon released. Only Japanese immigrants were subjected to the forced renunciation of all private properties and long-term imprisonment in internment camps.
<p>In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford officially proclaimed that enforced relocation was “wrong”, and a “national mistake” which “shall never again be repeated.” In 1988, President Ronald Regan signed Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (Restitution for WWII internment of Japanese-Americans and Aleuts). Federal Parliament gave an official apology to Japanese-Americans for violating the civil rights and liberties promised by the Constitution, granting each surviving internee $20,000.</p>
<p>These internment camps also existed in Canada and other allied countries. 20,000 people of Japanese descent, among which more than 75% held Canadian citizenship, were stripped of their properties and sent to internment camps.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1022402/files/20141117072543-ZHCF_WHY.jpg?1416237943"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1022417/files/20141117073038-ZHCF_WHY_image.jpg?1416238238"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Because… we don’t have enough money!!!
<p>We are invited by Japan Society but they can only provide funding for costs incurred after arriving in the USA. Because of the difference in timing between the fiscal years in Japan and the USA, we were ineligible to apply for funding within Japan for this production.</p>
<p>In this production, we have freshly recreated many parts, including the script itself. We have a new cast for this tour and the rehearsal period is extensive. For this show to be effective in the North American context, we have included more English in the script, for which the actors are working on the language very hard. We also have new costumes. However, none of these are funded yet.  </p>
<p>We believe that being able to fund a theatre production by tickets sales are ideal, but in reality, this is extremely difficult to achieve…much more so with an international tour. You all know that Japan is far away from North America, right?</p>
<p>If this “financially difficult” production can be made into “not so financially difficult” production by your support through crowd funding, we will largely benefit this year and we will all benefit into the future!</p>
<p>With its historical and contemporary significance, we need your help to tell this important and true story of Tokyo Rose, and expand the potential of how art can be made!</p>

</div></div>","This is Miwa Yanagi’s first international tour throughout North America, where story takes place. This journey, blending history and fiction, begins now. 
There was once a Japanese-American woman who was arrested in Japan and subsequently found guilty of treason in her homeland of America, after WWII.
Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tape is a story of “the voices without voice”, created and based on the true story of a sad fate in a time of turbulence.  2015 is an important year, marking 70 years since the end of WWII. There are many things that must not be forgotten, although, inevitably our memories gradually fade away year by year. We believe this story embraces many still-relevant  themes such as state of authority, war and mass media, racism, sexism; themes that should be revisited generation after generation.
Stage is to regain the lost and labelled voices, a ritual of channeling through the devices of theater and the living flesh of human beings. Theatre can only recall voices to the limited spaces of the proscenium. However, the value of going to the land, the place where these voices once existed through this particular art form is immeasurable.
2016 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth as well as 10 years since the death of Iva Toguri D’Aquino, the source of inspiration for this story. Japanese-Americans who were subjected to internment camps lived in silence about their experiences in order to survive post-war life as Americans. We have learned the importance of redressing the past over time, even with its difficulties, from Iva Toguri D’Aquino and, most recently, from the devastation of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011. And the time has come where we cannot turn a blind eye to the increasing tensions arising between neighboring countries on every continent, a disturbing echo of the past.  “Zero Hour” is the name of the radio program that broadcasted propaganda by the Japanese government to the Americans during WWII. The alluring voices of female announcers, brought to the soldiers fighting in the South Pacific, were initially dubbed ‘oriental witch’,  eventually becoming “Tokyo Rose”.  After the war, American soldiers and journalists flooded the ruins of Tokyo to lay their eyes on her.
These were women of Japanese descent who began as typists, dictating foreign short-wave before becoming announcers, broadcasting propaganda to American soldiers at sea; “Orphans in the Pacific.” They worked out of an isolated broadcasting studio, most of them far from their homeland. As such, they were also ‘orphans in the pacific’ themselves. The announcers were considered as enemies; whose own voices were sealed and before long, were accused as traitors by their own country, disappearing in the waves of history.
Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tape is a story around “voices” blending truth and fiction. In the world of set, costume and projection, voices of women are heard in various states, drifting between truth and falsehood, through the use of electronic amplification, radio technology, and in its natural state. Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tape was premiered in 2013 at KAAT(Kanagawa Arts Theatre) and AICHI TRIENNALE 2013 receiving rave reviews. Through invitation and support by Japan Society, we are now able to bring this story to North America, including California where this story takes place, with a new cast and script for an English-speaking audience.
(This production is predominantly performed in English and occasionally in Japanese with English subtitles.)Iva Toguri D'Aquino was born on July 4th, 1916, in California, USA. Her father, Jun, from Yamanashi, Japan, was manager of a general store that sold imported goods. Her mother, Fumi, originally from Tokyo, was a 2nd generation Japanese-American. In 1941, Iva travelled to her parents’ homeland of Japan to visit her sick aunt. Shortly after, WWII broke out and she lost her chance to go home. (Her mother died of illness en route to an internment camp for Japanese-Americans.)
Iva got a job at Radio Tokyo to contrive her living. She was selected to be an announcer, quickly becoming popular among American soldiers. While many female Japanese announcers revoked their American citizenship under pressure from Japanese authorities, Iva, with her strong patriotism, protected her American citizenship to the end. However, Japan’s defeat marked the beginning of Iva’s tragedy.  She was the first woman in American history to be found guilty of treason, charged and convicted of being an American supporting the propaganda broadcasting of enemies. She was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment with revocation of her American citizenship.
In 1970s, the validity of her verdict was brought under public scrutiny to be reconsidered.  Further inquiry revealed that the trial was beleaguered with systemic racism and the prejudice of the times, including an all-white jury, coupled with a conspiracy theory of Tom C. Clark, the attorney general under the Truman administration. In 1979, two witnesses from the trial, Iva’s former superior authorities, confessed; “The testimony was not based on facts but fabricated and forced by FBI.” In 1977, President Ford gave Iva a full pardon and reinstated her American citizenship.
In 1942, late February, Presidential Decree 9066 was officially announced. 120,000 Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants residing on the west coast of the USA, such as California and Washington and the territory of Hawaii, were forcibly removed. Noted former imprisoners include George Hasato Takei Altman and Isamu Noguchi. After the war, Japanese-Americans were denied their rightful citizenship, for the sole reason of having ancestral roots in America’s former enemy. It was not until June of 1952 that the Walter Emigrant Naturalization law was administered. In the beginning, German and Italian immigrants were also interned, but were soon released. Only Japanese immigrants were subjected to the forced renunciation of all private properties and long-term imprisonment in internment camps.
In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford officially proclaimed that enforced relocation was “wrong”, and a “national mistake” which “shall never again be repeated.” In 1988, President Ronald Regan signed Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (Restitution for WWII internment of Japanese-Americans and Aleuts). Federal Parliament gave an official apology to Japanese-Americans for violating the civil rights and liberties promised by the Constitution, granting each surviving internee $20,000.
These internment camps also existed in Canada and other allied countries. 20,000 people of Japanese descent, among which more than 75% held Canadian citizenship, were stripped of their properties and sent to internment camps.Because… we don’t have enough money!!!
We are invited by Japan Society but they can only provide funding for costs incurred after arriving in the USA. Because of the difference in timing between the fiscal years in Japan and the USA, we were ineligible to apply for funding within Japan for this production.
In this production, we have freshly recreated many parts, including the script itself. We have a new cast for this tour and the rehearsal period is extensive. For this show to be effective in the North American context, we have included more English in the script, for which the actors are working on the language very hard. We also have new costumes. However, none of these are funded yet.  
We believe that being able to fund a theatre production by tickets sales are ideal, but in reality, this is extremely difficult to achieve…much more so with an international tour. You all know that Japan is far away from North America, right?
If this “financially difficult” production can be made into “not so financially difficult” production by your support through crowd funding, we will largely benefit this year and we will all benefit into the future!
With its historical and contemporary significance, we need your help to tell this important and true story of Tokyo Rose, and expand the potential of how art can be made!

Miwa Yanagi is a contemporary artist, playwright and director based in Kyoto, Japan. She received attention for her photographic work such as “Elevator Girl” series and “My Grandmother” series, where she uses CG and special makeup. She held solo exhibitions at Deutsche Guggenheim, Germany, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, and others.  
Recently she has been energetically engaged in the world of theatre as both playwright and director. Her work, such as “1984”, a trilogy of the cradle of Japanese avant-garde art movement, taking place in Taisho Era, caught  great attention. She is currently embarking on a unprecedented project of importing a traveling stage trailer, which she exhibit as an art piece in Yokohama Triennial 2014, to tour around Japan to host theater shows on it. She is one of the most followed artists from both the visual art and theater world.  This tour of Zero Hour: Tokyo Rose's Last Tapewill be her first international theatre production.

<p>Çağdaş dans &amp; tiyatro üzerine işler üreten, disiplinlerarası sanat topluluğu olan <i>berika</i>, 2011 senesinde, Can Bora tarafından İstanbul'da kuruldu. Topluluk özgün yazılmış türkçe metinleri ve ""yeni teknolojiler"" ismiyle anılan mültimedya araçlarını kullanır. </p>
<p>(Kampanyanın GALLERY bölümüne bir göz atın!) Sahnedeki oyuncunun ""canlı"" görüntüsünü bilgisayarda önceden kaydedilmiş görüntünün üzerine montajlayarak, tiyatro sahnesinde ""simultane bir film"" sunulmasına izin verilen Green Box tekniğiyle tasarlanmış trilojinin ilk gösterisi <i>DANTEL</i> (2011)'den sonra, <b>şu anda <i>KAM</i> için prova aşamasındayız.</b> Oyunda kullanacağımız videoların yarısının çekimini kasım-aralık ayında bitirdik. Ocak 2015'te CANON bize ihtiyacımız olan birkaç kamerayı bir haftalığına ödünç vererek, ocak ayında gösterinin tüm çekim ve ""video art""larını da bitirmiş olacağız. <i>KAM</i>, İstanbul'da yaşayan dört arkadaşın birkaç günlük doğaya kaçışlarını ve burada bir şamanla karşılaşmalarını anlatıyor.

<p><b>Evet, yeni teknolojiler kullanarak bir tiyatro oyunu gerçekleştirmek pahalı, ama isteğimiz bizi canlı tutuyor!</b></p>
<p>Oyunu oynayacağımız profesyonel tiyatro sahnesinin günlük kirası 1.500 TL. Buna ek olarak; ekip, provalar, kostüm ve ışık tasarımı, ses tasarımı, videografi ve canlı montaj için sahne modüllerini de ekleyelim.</p>

<h3>
<i>berika</i> and the SHAMAN - PREMIER IN FEBRUARY 2015.</h3>
<p><i>berika </i>is an interdisciplinary art collective based in Istanbul. The collective works both on the fields of contemporary dance and theatre. It uses original texts and new technologies tools. After the success of the first performance <i>The LACEWORK,</i> actually we are in the middle of the rehearsals for the new work using the Green Box Trilogy : <i>The SHAMAN</i>. The half part of all of video shooting is done but CANON will lead some cameras (first week of January 2015) we need for one week in order to achieve our video shootings and the VIDEO ARTS (inspired by Bill Viola's work) for the performance. The play tells about the journey of four friends to the nature for a few days where they meet (?) a Shaman. The work aims to turn the stage into a film studio where the simultaneous images of the actors and the pre-recorded images will permit to the audience to see in the same time the making and the result of a new movie. </p>
<p>Take a look for <i>THE LACEWORK </i>or<b> GALLERY</b> on this window.</p>

<div>For <i>THE SHAMAN</i>, the whole play and the stage will be surrounded by Green Box Technique.<br/><h3><i>Problems</i></h3>
<p>As we are living in Turkey where the cultural conditions are getting worse, we are in the middle of a stuck! But never give up! We only welcome the good vibes! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Yes, using multimedia in a theatre is expensive! but it keeps us alive! </h3>
<p>Theater rental alone will cost 500 $ per show. Add to this the cost of promotion, staff, rehearsal, lighting &amp; costume design, sound design, videography and the making  of the stage modules. </p>
<p>We need two big Green Box systems, two new Mac Pro (convenient with HD cameras), two LCD screens and professional lighting for the Green Box. It figures over 10.000$.</p>
<h3><b>THE CREW</b></h3>

<b>text and direction: </b>Can Bora <b>performers</b>: Goncagul Sunar, Yunus Gunce, Basak Kivilcim Ertanoglu, Halil Ibrahim Irkli, Can Bora <b>project assistant:</b> Fuat Ozsavas <b>videography:</b> Firat Gurgen <b>live stage module:</b> Utku Ogut <b>music:</b> Mabel Matiz, Selin Damar, Utku Ogut <b>costume:</b> Selim Baklaci <b>stylist:</b> Melis Erdogan <b>with the collaboration</b> of SALT Galata <b>sponsor:</b> CANON<p></p>
<h2>as <i>berika</i>, we have already 4 projects attending to be created!</h2>
<p>So, as your help is extremely important for us; you don't help us just for one production but for 4 PRODUCTIONS!</p>
<p><i>The Munevver Residence</i> - the third project of the Green Box trilogy and <i>The Interrogation</i> are already written by Can Bora and are waiting to be staged!</p>
<p><i>The Perpetual Movement</i> and <i>The Division </i>are the contemporary dance projects using multimedia. The dancers and the video sketches are ready!</p>
<p>The projects are ready but they don't get materialised without the elements we need!</p>
<p>To show our profound gratitude for your support we are offering special thank-you perks including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Priority Tickets to Any Performance</li>
<li>Signed Memorabilia</li>
<li>Specialized Coaching in Dance, Theater and Yoga !</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Why a strong desire for creating?</h3>
<p>Never give up! I don't even remember what was my deepest ambition to take drama classes when I was ten years old. Theatre, dance, yoga were important steps to live an introspection and to understand ""what we really are."" I think we are bigger than we think what we are. </p>
<p>An enthusiasm comes when you create and you can't stop what your soul wants to achieve. The journey is not easy but it has to be continued. You have to create, if not, your mind will never stop dreaming.</p>
<p>As a young artist, I care of the human body's sensorial system and its possibilities and boundaries. All of our projects are focused on the connection of the mind with the soul and the body. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The theater is booked and the show will go on! </p>
<p>Regardless of whether we meet our goal in this campaign, we are determined to make this ambitious performance run a reality.</p>
<p>Your generous tax-deductible donation will help ensure that every member of this cast and crew is compensated quickly and appropriately. </p>

berika ve KAM - Şubat 2015'te PRÖMİYER
Çağdaş dans & tiyatro üzerine işler üreten, disiplinlerarası sanat topluluğu olan berika, 2011 senesinde, Can Bora tarafından İstanbul'da kuruldu. Topluluk özgün yazılmış türkçe metinleri ve ""yeni teknolojiler"" ismiyle anılan mültimedya araçlarını kullanır. 
(Kampanyanın GALLERY bölümüne bir göz atın!) Sahnedeki oyuncunun ""canlı"" görüntüsünü bilgisayarda önceden kaydedilmiş görüntünün üzerine montajlayarak, tiyatro sahnesinde ""simultane bir film"" sunulmasına izin verilen Green Box tekniğiyle tasarlanmış trilojinin ilk gösterisi DANTEL (2011)'den sonra, şu anda KAM için prova aşamasındayız. Oyunda kullanacağımız videoların yarısının çekimini kasım-aralık ayında bitirdik. Ocak 2015'te CANON bize ihtiyacımız olan birkaç kamerayı bir haftalığına ödünç vererek, ocak ayında gösterinin tüm çekim ve ""video art""larını da bitirmiş olacağız. KAM, İstanbul'da yaşayan dört arkadaşın birkaç günlük doğaya kaçışlarını ve burada bir şamanla karşılaşmalarını anlatıyor. Tüm gösterinin sahne tasarımı Green Box üzerinden kurulmuş olup, oyun tiyatro sahnesini bir film stüdyosuna dönüştürmeyi hedefliyor.
DANTEL için lütfen aşağıdaki link'e göz atın: 
http://www.can-bora.com/#!dantel/c1mzk DETAYLI BİLGİ İÇİN: www.can-bora.com Green Box (ya da Blue Screen)'lı tiyatro nasıl oluyor? diye soruyorsanız, lütfen aşağıdaki link'ten videoya ulaşın. Şifre olarak dan20tel14 yazın. KAM'da bütün oyun ve sahne Green Box ile oluşturulmuş olacak.https://vimeo.com/100048032

Sorunlar
Türkiye'deki kültürel politika ve ekonomi eksiklerinden dolayı, maalesef herhangi bir kurumsal yardım ya da destek yokluğundan projelerimizi gerçekleştirmek için bu bağış fonunu açtık. Vazgeçmek yok! Sadece iyi titreşimlerden yanayız!
Evet, yeni teknolojiler kullanarak bir tiyatro oyunu gerçekleştirmek pahalı, ama isteğimiz bizi canlı tutuyor!
Oyunu oynayacağımız profesyonel tiyatro sahnesinin günlük kirası 1.500 TL. Buna ek olarak; ekip, provalar, kostüm ve ışık tasarımı, ses tasarımı, videografi ve canlı montaj için sahne modüllerini de ekleyelim.
İki tane Green Box sistemi, iki yeni Mac PRO (HD kameralarla uyumlu), iki büyük LCD ekran ve Green Box sistemi için profesyonel ışıklara ihtiyacımız var ki toplam bütçe 30.000 TL'yi buluyor. 
KÜNYE
yazan-yöneten: Can Bora oyuncular: Goncagül Sunar, Yunus Günçe, Başak Kıvılcım Ertanoğlu, Halil İbrahim Irklı, Can Bora proje asistanı: Fuat Özsavaş videografi: Fırat Gürgen canlı montaj sahne modülü: Utku Öğüt müzik: Mabel Matiz, Selin Damar, Utku Öğüt kostüm: Selim Baklacı stilist: Melis Erdoğan destekçiler: Salt Galata sponsor: CANON
berika olarak, 4 projemiz daha yaratılmayı bekliyor!
Hatırlatalım: evet, yapacağınız bağış bizim için çok çok önemli! Lakin, bağışınızla sadece KAM için değil, berika'nın 4 yeni projesine de destek veriyor olacaksınız! 
Münevver Rezidans: Green Box tekniği ile tasarlanan trilojinin son oyunu ve Sorgu. 
Devinimsel Hareket ve Bölünme : mültimedya kullanarak tasarlanmış çağdaş dans projeleri. Video taslakları ve dansçılarımız şimdiden hazır!
Projelerimizin, metinleri ve sahne taslakları şu anda ""tamamlanmış"" halde fakat hayata geçmek için bahsettiğimiz tüm teknik materyellere ihtiyacımız var!
Bağışlarınız için size samimi bir şekilde şöyle teşekkür etmek istedik : yapacağınız bağış (PERK) karşılığında - istediğiniz gösterime davetiye, sosyal medyalarımızda adınıza özel teşekkürler; bireysel tiyatro, dans ya da yoga dersi! ve sürpriz video ve fotoğraflar!
Neden yaratmak için bu kadar derin ve kararlı bir arzu?
10 yaşımda kafamın içinden ne geçti de tiyatro kursuna başladım, bilmiyorum. Lakin tiyatro, dans, yoga ""kendini tanıma ve keşfetme"" konusunda önemli adımlar oldular ve olmaya da devam ediyor. Sandığımızdan daha ""engin"" olduğumuzu düşünüyorum. 
Yaratma sürecine girdiğinizde içinizden bir coşku yükseliyor. Ve ruhunuzun sizden arzu ettiğini gerçekleştirene kadar da durmak yok! Yolculuk kolay değil ama devam etmek zorunda. Bizler yaratmak zorundayız, yoksa asla zihnimiz durmayacak!
Genç bir sanatçı olarak, özellikle ""insan bedeninin duyumsal (algı) sistemi ve bunun sınır ve yapabileceklerini"" önemsiyorum. Derin varlıklarız, ve kendimize dair, varoluşumuza dair keşfedilecek çooook şey var! berika'nın tüm projeleri zihin-beden ve ruh farkındalığı konusunu içeriyor. 
Riskler ve Fırsatlar
Tiyatro ile anlaşmamız imzalanmış durumda ve gösterimler ne şekilde olursa olsun devam etmek zorunda!
Total fon rakamımıza ulaşmış olalım olmayalım, bu hayalimizi gerçekleştirmekte kararlıyız!
Şimdiden teşekkürler ve KAM'ın size getireceği ""iyi titreşimler"" için hazırlanın!

berika and the SHAMAN - PREMIER IN FEBRUARY 2015.
berika is an interdisciplinary art collective based in Istanbul. The collective works both on the fields of contemporary dance and theatre. It uses original texts and new technologies tools. After the success of the first performance The LACEWORK, actually we are in the middle of the rehearsals for the new work using the Green Box Trilogy : The SHAMAN. The half part of all of video shooting is done but CANON will lead some cameras (first week of January 2015) we need for one week in order to achieve our video shootings and the VIDEO ARTS (inspired by Bill Viola's work) for the performance. The play tells about the journey of four friends to the nature for a few days where they meet (?) a Shaman. The work aims to turn the stage into a film studio where the simultaneous images of the actors and the pre-recorded images will permit to the audience to see in the same time the making and the result of a new movie. 
Take a look for THE LACEWORK or GALLERY on this window.

If you are asking ""what is like a theatre using Green Box (or Blue Screen technique), have a look on the video : https://vimeo.com/100048032 
The password is: dan20tel14
For THE SHAMAN, the whole play and the stage will be surrounded by Green Box Technique.Problems
As we are living in Turkey where the cultural conditions are getting worse, we are in the middle of a stuck! But never give up! We only welcome the good vibes! 

Yes, using multimedia in a theatre is expensive! but it keeps us alive! 
Theater rental alone will cost 500 $ per show. Add to this the cost of promotion, staff, rehearsal, lighting & costume design, sound design, videography and the making  of the stage modules. 
We need two big Green Box systems, two new Mac Pro (convenient with HD cameras), two LCD screens and professional lighting for the Green Box. It figures over 10.000$.
THE CREW

text and direction: Can Bora performers: Goncagul Sunar, Yunus Gunce, Basak Kivilcim Ertanoglu, Halil Ibrahim Irkli, Can Bora project assistant: Fuat Ozsavas videography: Firat Gurgen live stage module: Utku Ogut music: Mabel Matiz, Selin Damar, Utku Ogut costume: Selim Baklaci stylist: Melis Erdogan with the collaboration of SALT Galata sponsor: CANON
as berika, we have already 4 projects attending to be created!
So, as your help is extremely important for us; you don't help us just for one production but for 4 PRODUCTIONS!
The Munevver Residence - the third project of the Green Box trilogy and The Interrogation are already written by Can Bora and are waiting to be staged!
The Perpetual Movement and The Division are the contemporary dance projects using multimedia. The dancers and the video sketches are ready!
The projects are ready but they don't get materialised without the elements we need!
To show our profound gratitude for your support we are offering special thank-you perks including: 

Priority Tickets to Any Performance
Signed Memorabilia
Specialized Coaching in Dance, Theater and Yoga !



Why a strong desire for creating?
Never give up! I don't even remember what was my deepest ambition to take drama classes when I was ten years old. Theatre, dance, yoga were important steps to live an introspection and to understand ""what we really are."" I think we are bigger than we think what we are. 
An enthusiasm comes when you create and you can't stop what your soul wants to achieve. The journey is not easy but it has to be continued. You have to create, if not, your mind will never stop dreaming.
As a young artist, I care of the human body's sensorial system and its possibilities and boundaries. All of our projects are focused on the connection of the mind with the soul and the body. 
Risks & Challenges
The theater is booked and the show will go on! 
Regardless of whether we meet our goal in this campaign, we are determined to make this ambitious performance run a reality.
Your generous tax-deductible donation will help ensure that every member of this cast and crew is compensated quickly and appropriately. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute financially, there are many other ways to support The Shaman. You can:

</p><p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>Paola Escobar, a native of Colombia, has been part of the South Florida dance
community since 2006, performing and choreographing contemporary works within the
language of Flamenco and modern dance. Before relocating to South Florida, Paola
was a company member of L’explose Danza Contemporanea Company (2003 to 2005),
known for it’s work in Dance Theater, and has toured in Europe, Asia, and Latin
America. As a company member, Escobar gained a sense of awareness of the dramatic
thread, consciousness and raw emotion that has carried through in her own work as a
dancer and choreographer.
</p>
<p>From 2003 to 2005 Escobar was also part of the 34% Visibles , an Afro-contemporary
dance project directed by Rafael Palacios which participated in festivals in Canada,
Spain and Colombia. Working with Mr Palacios gave Paola the opportunity to explore
the expressive underlying load when taking the body beyond the limit of fatigue, which
she further explored in her 2007 solo work Viaje de Regreso which premiered in The
Colony Theatre, and then presented in south Florida in University Center for the
Performing Arts, and in Bogota in different scenarios.
</p>
<p>Through her interest in the process of how to create and/or find emotion through art,
Escobar continues to incorporate and blend different dance and theater ideologies to
achieve her creative purpose. Flamenco 24 Horas was a trio created in Columbia and re
staged as part of Flamenco in the Sun 2009 at the Broward Center for the Performing
Arts, which blended dance and theater with live music, and to create a story of three
women that out of context made of Flamenco their lifestyle.
</p>
<p>Through experimentation and improvisation, Paola has been able to constantly expand
her movement vocabulary to express her current journey. Flamenco has provided
Escobar with a completely different approach to movement (compare with traditional
western dance techniques), training Paola in the field of improvisation within the
parameters of musical structures. From 2000 to 2005 while living in Bogota, Escobar
directed her own Flamenco project which was awarded the National Dance Award in
2005 granted by the Colombian Ministry of Culture for her work Flamenco 24 Hours,
among others. In 2006 Escobar moved to Florida where she has worked as a dancer
and choreographer for the local Flamenco Companies as Bailes Ferrer, Siempre
Flamenco, and Ballet Flamenco La Rosa performing in Jackie Gleason Theater,
Broward Center for the Performing Arts, Parker Playhouse, Arsht Center Black Box,
South Miami Dade Cultural Arts Center, among others. In recent years Escobar has
ventured outside the boundaries of dance by becoming a member of the theater group
Antiheroes; and by collaborating with filmmakers and video directors Claudio Marcotulli,
Roberto Garrido, and Cristobal Valencillos, as actress and choreographer.
</p>
<p>Escobar holds a BFA from New World School of the Arts obtained in 2012, and in 2015
has joined the MFA choreography program at California Institute of the Arts <br/></p>

Paola Escobar, La Flamenca



Paola Escobar, a native of Colombia, has been part of the South Florida dance
community since 2006, performing and choreographing contemporary works within the
language of Flamenco and modern dance. Before relocating to South Florida, Paola
was a company member of L’explose Danza Contemporanea Company (2003 to 2005),
known for it’s work in Dance Theater, and has toured in Europe, Asia, and Latin
America. As a company member, Escobar gained a sense of awareness of the dramatic
thread, consciousness and raw emotion that has carried through in her own work as a
dancer and choreographer.

From 2003 to 2005 Escobar was also part of the 34% Visibles , an Afro-contemporary
dance project directed by Rafael Palacios which participated in festivals in Canada,
Spain and Colombia. Working with Mr Palacios gave Paola the opportunity to explore
the expressive underlying load when taking the body beyond the limit of fatigue, which
she further explored in her 2007 solo work Viaje de Regreso which premiered in The
Colony Theatre, and then presented in south Florida in University Center for the
Performing Arts, and in Bogota in different scenarios.

Through her interest in the process of how to create and/or find emotion through art,
Escobar continues to incorporate and blend different dance and theater ideologies to
achieve her creative purpose. Flamenco 24 Horas was a trio created in Columbia and re
staged as part of Flamenco in the Sun 2009 at the Broward Center for the Performing
Arts, which blended dance and theater with live music, and to create a story of three
women that out of context made of Flamenco their lifestyle.

Through experimentation and improvisation, Paola has been able to constantly expand
her movement vocabulary to express her current journey. Flamenco has provided
Escobar with a completely different approach to movement (compare with traditional
western dance techniques), training Paola in the field of improvisation within the
parameters of musical structures. From 2000 to 2005 while living in Bogota, Escobar
directed her own Flamenco project which was awarded the National Dance Award in
2005 granted by the Colombian Ministry of Culture for her work Flamenco 24 Hours,
among others. In 2006 Escobar moved to Florida where she has worked as a dancer
and choreographer for the local Flamenco Companies as Bailes Ferrer, Siempre
Flamenco, and Ballet Flamenco La Rosa performing in Jackie Gleason Theater,
Broward Center for the Performing Arts, Parker Playhouse, Arsht Center Black Box,
South Miami Dade Cultural Arts Center, among others. In recent years Escobar has
ventured outside the boundaries of dance by becoming a member of the theater group
Antiheroes; and by collaborating with filmmakers and video directors Claudio Marcotulli,
Roberto Garrido, and Cristobal Valencillos, as actress and choreographer.

Escobar holds a BFA from New World School of the Arts obtained in 2012, and in 2015
has joined the MFA choreography program at California Institute of the Arts

<h3>So, what's the story?</h3>
<p>Farewell Chris Yee spins a tale in which the best and the brightest of California’s tech progeny are left reeling from spates of school suicides as a result of their frantic race to the top. At the start of the show, the discovery that another student has gone missing leads to the search for the body, the search for reason, and the revelation of the true cause and ultimate downfall of the school’s up-and-coming students. The contemplation of what it means to be present and what it means to be missing bring the show to its conclusion, as we witness the unexpected winners and losers in the race to nowhere, and the pursuit of perfection.</p>
<p>Recognizing that episodes of clustered suicides among highly-pressured, high-achieving public school students are a reality, this work of pure fiction uses the concepts of the quest for unattainable goals and the normalization of cut-throat competition as a springboard for exploration of an environment where any rule is free to be broken.</p> <h3>Meet the Team!</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Sierra Blanco, and I am the playwright/composer/lyricist. I am of the current generation of students who have experienced the strange world of high-pressure, high-stakes academics.  News outlets report the unfortunate results of these academic experiments on youth, but a voice of and by the young people is currently silenced in this arena. This new musical Farewell Chris Yee gives voice to and insight into the lives and current pressures of the up and coming generation. I am working on this project with an amazingly talented group of young performers, as well as the Director Beth Milles, Musical Director Matt Russell, and Dramaturg Morgan Jenness. Each and every one of those people are astounding and accomplished and I am honored to be colleagues with them. </p>
<p>Every contribution, be it $1, $5, or $100, is meaningful in getting this work to a developmental reading stage. Truly, every little bit will add up to our being able to pay for rehearsal space for the actors to explore and develop the world, for us to be able to print out scores and scripts, for there to be stipends for the performers,  and on and on. Our goal is to get this project to production, but it takes long bouts of development before it can be polished to that level, This is an exciting step for the project, and we need your help to keep it moving along the path!</p> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $2,500 for this week-long developmental stage of the project.  Every penny of this will go directly to the development of the project, securing rehearsal space, creating the necessary rehearsal materials, reworking the scores and polishing the music with Musical Director Matt Russell and exploring the world of the script with Director Beth Milles. </p>
<p>I am asking all of my friends and colleagues - if you would ever consider buying me a Chai latte (you know how I love those!) please make a contribution to the fund instead!</p>
<p>Every contribution is meaningful and will help to make this developmental reading stage a success. I have worked on this script and score for two years, and I have a great deal of belief in the project's voice and story. I feel it is a timely story, coming from a unique perspective and that people will ultimately be moved by seeing and hearing it. You can be a part of this project's story - you can be a part of its development and trajectory. Please consider making a donation, small or large to help me get this off the ground. We are going to do this project one way or another, so hopefully we can gather all of the necessary funds before the developmental reading. If we don't reach our goal, we will do the project and continue to fundraise to cover the deficit.</p>
<p>Perks of donating to develop a new musical? Well, I will personally write and thank everyone who donates any amount of course! </p>

<p>With a $500 donation, I will write a song specifically for you (unrelated to the show.)

<h3>Our Story</h3>Beautiful Soup has spent the last two years creating theatre for the community, donating our box offices to charities who are connected to the piece we are presenting, and building a repertory collective of creativity. <br/><br/>But with the economic climate, it is growing harder and harder for us to do so. We don't need a lot of help, but we do need some from our loyal patrons. <br/><br/>Jump into the Soup with us and donate $1, $5, $100, whatever moves you. Every penny raised will go towards paying for a theatre for our New York premiere production of Steven Carl McCasland's ""neat &amp; tidy"". The funds raised at the box office of this exciting play will all go to Beautiful Soup's upcoming third season. We want to continue to give to the community, but can't do so without your continued support. <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we're unable to raise the funds, not only will ""neat &amp; tidy"" not happen, but Beautiful Soup will find itself struggling to produce another show. We can't continue to give to the community without being able to support ourselves by renting space, buying props and/or costumes, and bringing theater to all of you. With ""neat &amp; tidy"", we hope to raise enough funds to support another year of charitable theatre for all of our friends at BC/EFA, The Fortune Society, A-STEP and other wonderful organizations!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We've been generously donated rehearsal space, and the costumes and props for this play are very minimal and very contemporary. What we need is help paying for the theater rental -- in fact, we need just our first down payment! Once tickets to go on sale, we'll have funds coming in to lay out. But we need your help to get us there. <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Skip Starbucks today and send that $5.00 to Beautiful Soup! But if you can't (and even if you can, and do), SHARE the word! Tell your friends. Encourage them to donate as well. Every penny earned helps. If just 150 people donated $10, we'd reach our goal. And if just 75 people donate $20? We'd be there before you could say ""Beautiful Soup""!<br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>I started Young Actors Theater Company thinking it would be a small after school drama club with about 30 kids. In less than one week of the program I had over 80 kids signed up and 40 more on a waiting list. In the last 1 1/2 years we have added 4 schools, put on 4 productions and have had over 300 kids go through our program! Because this was an after school program, we practiced at the schools and rented a theater for our final performances.<br/><br/>With our program was growing so quickly and the costs to rent the schools and theaters being so excessive, we wanted to find our own space.

</div></div>","Our StoryI started Young Actors Theater Company thinking it would be a small after school drama club with about 30 kids. In less than one week of the program I had over 80 kids signed up and 40 more on a waiting list. In the last 1 1/2 years we have added 4 schools, put on 4 productions and have had over 300 kids go through our program! Because this was an after school program, we practiced at the schools and rented a theater for our final performances.With our program was growing so quickly and the costs to rent the schools and theaters being so excessive, we wanted to find our own space. This spring we found a building that is nearly perfect. It has several large practice rooms, a 500 seat theater with a sound and light system, storage and some office space. We can now expand the program to all the elementary schools in the area and finally be able to offer a summer camp. This fall weare expanding our program to 10 elementary schools and adding a 6-8th grade evening class.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Ballarat. When you think of this town in Victoria, Australia, you think of Gold, the Eureka Rebellion and some of the worst child sexual abuse in the world. It has been estimated that between 5000 and 8000 children were sexually abused from 1965 to 1985 in a town that had a population of around 80,000 at the time. There were so many perpetrators that most victims were abused by multiple men. In recent years Ballarat has once again made the news because of the numbers of premature deaths and suicides of the survivors of the abuses. Now its time for the solution to rise from the abuses of the past. We need to help the survivors and stop the deaths.
Here are four victims giving evidence to the Royal Commission in Ballarat.  The stories are horrendous, and show the level of abuse and suffering in Ballarat.

This project seeks to remember the lives of female artists, valuing their work and lives for what they were; without compartmentalizing them into the idealized Western suicidal facade. The works of the “characters” in our piece are important because of their brilliance, and not because of the nature of the artist’s death. As women, and as artists, we feel responsible for making a space for both the female artist and her art; striving to liberate her from mere “posthumous fame.”</p><h3>What Our Show Will Be:</h3><p>In our piece will be focusing on the works and lives of the following five female artists:</p><p>                                                     <b>      Diane Arbus</b></p><p><b>                                                            Sylvia Plath</b></p><p><b>                                                              Kay Sage</b></p><p><b>                                                           Anne Sexton</b></p><b>                                                   Francesca Woodman</b><p>We're using a process called devising for this show, which means that we are creating all the material, as an ensemble from scratch. This method is different from traditional theater making because all of us act as collaborators, creating together the words we say, the movements we make and the vision of the piece. As an ensemble, we have begun the process of getting to know who these women are, of familiarizing ourselves with not only their lives and deaths, but with the totality of these women: their nuances, behavior, philosophy, and physicality. Sourcing imagery, text and biography from and concerning these women, we've began creating material that we'll be part of our immersive piece of theater.</p><p><br/></p><div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p>As a group of current and recently graduated college students, the production, creation, and performance of an original piece of theatre is quite daunting. We need the help of contributors like <i><b>you</b></i> to make this piece a reality. The money raised during this campaign will help to cover the cost of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Costume</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Insurance </li>
<li>The Services of a Stage Manager</li>
<li>Advertising Materials &amp; Web Marketing</li>
<li>Packaging for our Donor Incentives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>If we do not reach our entire fundraising goal, our vision for this piece will be compromised but our passion will not! No matter what we receive, we will complete this project. But your donations we help to realize this project to it's fullest potential. We are a professional, knowledgeable and resilient group of young theatre artists hoping to fill the space that we’ve found in our world with our work. We feel a responsibility to all of our fellow female artists (of past, present, and future) to make a piece of theatre about them, for them. Contributions from donors like you will help to guarantee that our vivid dream can become a most brilliant reality.</p>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<div>
<p>The <b>She Is A Problem</b> is made up of a company of entirely women who are dedicated to the creation of new and challenging works of theatre that question the meaning of what it means to be a woman and an artist. The ensemble is made up of the following members:</p>

<p><b>Emily Alexander ||</b> aspires to be more problematic in the future; this piece is just the beginning of her journey to finding her voice. She makes theater because when you move others, you create waves. She wants to create theatrical experiences that push boundaries—of what we think bodies can do, of what we think narrative can do, of what we think theater can do. She is so grateful for working with this amazing ensemble of women and can’t wait to see where life takes her next.</p>
<p><b>Nia Benjamin ||</b> is an emerging Philadelphia theatre artist currently pursuing her BFA Acting degree from the University of the Arts. She devotes her spare time to things that make her happy, especially crushing the patriarchy. She is honored to be among this innovative group of lady theatre warriors. </p>
<p><b>Kahla Brown ||</b> is an artist struggling with the place and value of art in a world torn up by ignorance and oppression. She believes the greatest hope for women lies in the formation of communities and disinterest in competition. She believes the greatest way to solve problems is to ask questions. She hopes you arrive at She Is A Problem with a lot of questions, and leave with even more.</p>
<p><b>Rebecca Buckley |</b>| is a problem because she puts her whole body as a medium into her work as an artist, movement based performer, and model.  She is a problem because she is versed in eight stage combat weapons, and because she continues to create characters that upset the patriarchy with their femininity and feminism. She currently produces the Philadelphia-based YouTube sketch comedy series Second State with co producer and best friend Andrew Schiffrin. She is a Problem is Rebecca’s fourth devised show she has had the special privilege to be part of creating.</p>
<p><b>Gracie Martin ||</b> is an actor, singer, writer and explorative artist. Devised theatre came into her life in a big way when trying to wrap her mind around the fraught and frustrating progression of human rights in Russia. Gracie believes not only in revolt against forces that harm women, but in positive, creative endeavors that celebrate what feminists throughout history have fought for, while also asking audiences explore and discover their own path to a more equal society.</p>
<p><b>Amy Harper ||</b> is a designer, writer, illustrator, and seamstress. She uses art as a medium to question accepted societal norms and eradicate defective institutions. She hopes to incite change by spreading excitement and fervor to her community. Amy is a compulsive creator and believes in spreading ideas like dandelion seeds in the hopes that if a hundred and one are thrown at least a few will bloom. She believes in seeking out and recording both the whimsical magic of our world along with its dysfunctional cruelty. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Check out our first promotional video, featuring a quote from Ariana Reines in her essay on Francesca Woodman here. What We're About:Why is the death of the female artist seductiveromantic                 problematic                                        and why                                                       or how                                                                     do we propagate it?Why are we more comfortable with dead female artists than living female artists?She Is A Problem, as a piece of theatre and movement, yearns to abandon the romantic element of suicide. This project seeks to remember the lives of female artists, valuing their work and lives for what they were; without compartmentalizing them into the idealized Western suicidal facade. The works of the “characters” in our piece are important because of their brilliance, and not because of the nature of the artist’s death. As women, and as artists, we feel responsible for making a space for both the female artist and her art; striving to liberate her from mere “posthumous fame.”What Our Show Will Be:In our piece will be focusing on the works and lives of the following five female artists:                                                           Diane Arbus                                                            Sylvia Plath                                                              Kay Sage                                                           Anne Sexton                                                   Francesca WoodmanWe're using a process called devising for this show, which means that we are creating all the material, as an ensemble from scratch. This method is different from traditional theater making because all of us act as collaborators, creating together the words we say, the movements we make and the vision of the piece. As an ensemble, we have begun the process of getting to know who these women are, of familiarizing ourselves with not only their lives and deaths, but with the totality of these women: their nuances, behavior, philosophy, and physicality. Sourcing imagery, text and biography from and concerning these women, we've began creating material that we'll be part of our immersive piece of theater.
How You Can Help:
As a group of current and recently graduated college students, the production, creation, and performance of an original piece of theatre is quite daunting. We need the help of contributors like you to make this piece a reality. The money raised during this campaign will help to cover the cost of: 

Costume
Props
Insurance 
The Services of a Stage Manager
Advertising Materials & Web Marketing
Packaging for our Donor Incentives

Risks & Challenges:
If we do not reach our entire fundraising goal, our vision for this piece will be compromised but our passion will not! No matter what we receive, we will complete this project. But your donations we help to realize this project to it's fullest potential. We are a professional, knowledgeable and resilient group of young theatre artists hoping to fill the space that we’ve found in our world with our work. We feel a responsibility to all of our fellow female artists (of past, present, and future) to make a piece of theatre about them, for them. Contributions from donors like you will help to guarantee that our vivid dream can become a most brilliant reality.
Who We Are:

The She Is A Problem is made up of a company of entirely women who are dedicated to the creation of new and challenging works of theatre that question the meaning of what it means to be a woman and an artist. The ensemble is made up of the following members:

<h3>About The Project</h3> <p>It's always difficult to imagine a relevant conversation about war, or<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> about how much loss we're even able to endure, whether our battles are on the ground, or in the mind. </span></p>

<p><i>Bengal Tiger At The Baghdad Zoo</i> is the story of an unusual group of characters, bound together in the chaos that becomes Baghdad in 2003. A story that hits you in the gut, punches you in face, and pushes you down the stairs (going a bit overboard, but hopefully you'll come to see why this play has made us so passionate). <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">You hear that? That call to prayer? A constellation of minarets surrounds this garden, each one singing at a different key. They come in like a fog, five times a day. Different mosques, all over the city, calling out to God, voices intermingling in the air. </span></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When an atheist suddenly finds himself walking around after death, he's got some serious </span>re-evaluating<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to do - Tiger </span></span></i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tom and Kev have been in the city for a few months, connected by a somewhat forced friendship. While trying to endure the intense military invasion, the two American soldiers end up on watch duty at the city zoo, guarding a particularly </span>rowdy<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Bengal tiger. Provoking an attack by the animal, Kev kills the tiger to save his friend, unleashing a chain of events that lead to the </span>unraveling<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of all the </span>characters<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Able to walk and talk like a human being, the tiger becomes one of the many ghosts to haunt the city, looking for meaning, and redemption, in a seemingly endless mess. Confined by their experiences, and unable to find their way 'home', the soldiers face a relentless </span>merging<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of </span>reality<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and aberration, intertwined with their Iraqi translator, who fights a past that tears away at his humanity, and future. </span></span></p>

<p>Giving a human voice to the constructed paradigms of war, this story not only tells of the choices that these characters have to make, but also of the relationships forged between them. A connection so powerful that it transcends to the metaphysical plain, echoing the traces and consequences of their existence, as well as their individual battles. </p>
<p>Harsh, and at times ridiculously funny, the play has not only given us an exciting and inspired piece to tackle, but also the opportunity to work with a talented and diverse group of 15 different theatre and design artists in Montreal. With your help, we'll be able to share this project and perform for three nights, between the 26 and the 28th of February 2015, at Geordie's <i>Espace 4001. </i></p>

Does it still itch? It's a phantom limb, Tommy. Just because it's gone doesn't mean it's not there - Kev </i><br/></i></p> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<div>By raising money to cover part of our budget, you would allow a cast of students to split the revenue from the box-office, basically helping to keep them alive. </div>
<div>The amount we're hoping for will be used for two crucial elements:</div>
<div>We had our hearts set on a small and intimate<b> venue</b>, which we found in <i>Espace 4001</i>, a black-box theatre along Berri St. For three performances, along with the use of the space before-hand for set-up and run through, th<span style=""background-color: initial;"">e sum of rental fees would come to around $1200. </span>
</div>
<div>In addition, the <b>copyrights</b> to the play, payed to Dramatists Play Service, Inc. would cost $300 ($100 for every showing). </div>
<div>Now, the fact that you've made it this far down the page and that you're still reading clearly states how awesome and wonderful you are, and because of this, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">we would like to encourage you or your friends by offering some perks as a humble ""thank you"" for all your support and generosity. </span>

<p>Laurent has always had a passion for make-believe, theatre, film, television, literature and all other forms of artistic expression. An Honours graduate of Dawson College's Professional Theatre program (receiving an award per year for his work), Laurent had the chance to play many memorable characters and develop his craft as a performer. He is currently studying Playwriting at Concordia University. Despite a majority of experience in English, Laurent seeks to forge himself a unique and bilingual career as an actor, writer, director and artist.</p>

<p>Vishesh is a young emerging theatre artist and intellectual idiot currently based in his hometown of Montreal, Quebec. Throughout his life, he has harboured a passionate, almost militant belief in the power of words and of storytelling. When he is not acting on the stage, he can be found writing for it with a particular focus on social satire—arising from a natural tendency to take people’s follies and vices seriously—as well as comedy, which he slid into upon realizing that he could look forward to a lifetime of nobody ever fully taking him seriously.</p>
<p>Even during his time as a Playwriting student at Concordia University, Vishesh has staged several productions of his work and made substantial contributions to Montreal’s theatre scene. In his first year alone he mounted an award-winning production of his short absurdist play <i>Fourth Wall Syndrome</i> at the Mainline Theatre as part of the 1st Annual Gala for Student Drama (Best Writing, 2011).

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>TELL THE WORLD!</p>
</div></div>","About The Project It's always difficult to imagine a relevant conversation about war, or about how much loss we're even able to endure, whether our battles are on the ground, or in the mind. 
That is until author Rajiv Joseph gives us a sharp, and haunting voice with which to speak. 
Bengal Tiger At The Baghdad Zoo is the story of an unusual group of characters, bound together in the chaos that becomes Baghdad in 2003. A story that hits you in the gut, punches you in face, and pushes you down the stairs (going a bit overboard, but hopefully you'll come to see why this play has made us so passionate).   
You hear that? That call to prayer? A constellation of minarets surrounds this garden, each one singing at a different key. They come in like a fog, five times a day. Different mosques, all over the city, calling out to God, voices intermingling in the air. When an atheist suddenly finds himself walking around after death, he's got some serious re-evaluating to do - Tiger 
Tom and Kev have been in the city for a few months, connected by a somewhat forced friendship. While trying to endure the intense military invasion, the two American soldiers end up on watch duty at the city zoo, guarding a particularly rowdy Bengal tiger. Provoking an attack by the animal, Kev kills the tiger to save his friend, unleashing a chain of events that lead to the unraveling of all the characters. Able to walk and talk like a human being, the tiger becomes one of the many ghosts to haunt the city, looking for meaning, and redemption, in a seemingly endless mess. Confined by their experiences, and unable to find their way 'home', the soldiers face a relentless merging of reality and aberration, intertwined with their Iraqi translator, who fights a past that tears away at his humanity, and future. 
I'm a gardener! Do you understand? I'm not a terrorist! I'm not an arms dealer! I'm not a translator, or a ""terp""! I am a gardener! I am an artist! - Musa
Giving a human voice to the constructed paradigms of war, this story not only tells of the choices that these characters have to make, but also of the relationships forged between them. A connection so powerful that it transcends to the metaphysical plain, echoing the traces and consequences of their existence, as well as their individual battles. 
Harsh, and at times ridiculously funny, the play has not only given us an exciting and inspired piece to tackle, but also the opportunity to work with a talented and diverse group of 15 different theatre and design artists in Montreal. With your help, we'll be able to share this project and perform for three nights, between the 26 and the 28th of February 2015, at Geordie's Espace 4001. 
We're broken, man. You, me, Tiger. It's like we fell through a prism that night at the zoo and each part of ourselves just started to separate. Does your hand still tickle? Does it still itch? It's a phantom limb, Tommy. Just because it's gone doesn't mean it's not there - Kev    How You Can Help
By raising money to cover part of our budget, you would allow a cast of students to split the revenue from the box-office, basically helping to keep them alive. 
The amount we're hoping for will be used for two crucial elements:
We had our hearts set on a small and intimate venue, which we found in Espace 4001, a black-box theatre along Berri St. For three performances, along with the use of the space before-hand for set-up and run through, the sum of rental fees would come to around $1200. 

In addition, the copyrights to the play, payed to Dramatists Play Service, Inc. would cost $300 ($100 for every showing). 
Now, the fact that you've made it this far down the page and that you're still reading clearly states how awesome and wonderful you are, and because of this, we would like to encourage you or your friends by offering some perks as a humble ""thank you"" for all your support and generosity. 

 
  The Team




Laurent McCuaig-Pitre Kev




Laurent has always had a passion for make-believe, theatre, film, television, literature and all other forms of artistic expression. An Honours graduate of Dawson College's Professional Theatre program (receiving an award per year for his work), Laurent had the chance to play many memorable characters and develop his craft as a performer. He is currently studying Playwriting at Concordia University. Despite a majority of experience in English, Laurent seeks to forge himself a unique and bilingual career as an actor, writer, director and artist.
Watch out! This young man is already making some big waves. With LAB 87, Laurent jumped onto the francophone scene by taking on the role of Evan in the bilingual production Les Flâneurs Célestes, translated from the American playThe Aliens by Annie Barker. Critics, newspapers, and the general public agree that this young man is definitely on the right track. Laurent is also an independent artist. His new theatre company, 32-Hour Theatre Company, experienced a phenomenal début in the 4th Gala for Student Drama at the Mainline Theatre in Montreal, with his play If Only. This past summer, 32-HTC also produced another play of his creation, This Is Not A Play, as part of the Montreal Saint-Ambroise FRINGE Festival, also at the Mainline Theatre. Just recently, in the event of the SIPA (Short Works) Festival at Concordia, he took on the role of an epileptic lost soul of a man, Noah, in 32-HTC's production of Cockroaches.

Laurent is blessed to be working with such an amazing group of artists and to be entrusted to tell this heartbreaking story of war through a soldier's eyes. 
Ryan Doherty Tom




Ryan is a recent graduate of Dawson's Professional Theatre
Program. He is ecstatic to be part of this production, playing alongside
a group of such talented actors. Ryan has been honing his craft with roles like Master Ford in
Merry Wives of Windsor, Michael Lind in Lion in the Streets and Timms in The
History Boys, all showcased
at Dawson College. 


Vishesh Abeyratne Tiger 



Vishesh is a young emerging theatre artist and intellectual idiot currently based in his hometown of Montreal, Quebec. Throughout his life, he has harboured a passionate, almost militant belief in the power of words and of storytelling. When he is not acting on the stage, he can be found writing for it with a particular focus on social satire—arising from a natural tendency to take people’s follies and vices seriously—as well as comedy, which he slid into upon realizing that he could look forward to a lifetime of nobody ever fully taking him seriously.
Even during his time as a Playwriting student at Concordia University, Vishesh has staged several productions of his work and made substantial contributions to Montreal’s theatre scene. In his first year alone he mounted an award-winning production of his short absurdist play Fourth Wall Syndrome at the Mainline Theatre as part of the 1st Annual Gala for Student Drama (Best Writing, 2011). The following year, his one-act drama Exposure toured to several high schools across the island of Montreal before being published and licensed by YouthPLAYS, Inc. 
In his final year, his comedy Racial Roulette premiered as a workshop production at the 2013 St. Ambroise Montreal Fringe Festival, where it was nominated for the Chapters Best English Text Award. And just last winter, in his first year out of school, Vishesh was commissioned by actor/dancer/choreographer Deepali Lindblom to write another drama called Wake, Butterfly, which was staged at the Bain St. Michel in a co-production with Infinitheatre. Vishesh also enjoys performing for the stage almost as much as he enjoys creating new work for it. Throughout the better part of last year he had a ball travelling with the Montreal Shakespeare Theatre Company in their 2014 school tour production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, in which he played Demetrius and Francis Flute. Favourite past roles of Vishesh’s include Sanjeet in his own Racial Roulette, Ishaan in Jocasta’s Noose (Montreal Fringe Festival, 2012), and Jean in Rhinoceros (Dawson Theatre Collective, 2009).
Plays like this only come around every so often, and Vishesh is absolutely thrilled at the opportunity to sink his teeth into one as rich, as funny, as uncomfortable and as tragic as Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo. He would like to thank each and every single one of his talented and wonderful fellow artists on this show that have helped him to grow and stretch as an actor, and he hopes you will all do your part to support local theatre by coming out to see us bring this haunting tale to life.

She's looking forward to sharing this story with you, because she believes it's one worth telling, and would like to thank everyone (including you, dear reader) for all their love and support. Whoever made it this far down the page: You're a special kind of unicorn, my friend. 





Öykü
Önder Designer


Öykü can be recognized by her curly hair and strong Turkish
accent. Apart from being a theatre person, she happens to be interested in
different branches of design, architecture, literature, visual arts, and
various forms of expression. She really enjoys interacting with different
cultures and working with people from different backgrounds. She tries to
combine her own experiences, both good and bad, with other people’s, and tries
to reflect that in her work. Her main interest in theatre is to communicate these
different experiences and create an understanding between people. 
Before moving to Montreal, Öykü worked in a few shows, both
on stage and as part of a crew. She graduated from the International
Baccalaureate Program in Istanbul, Turkey, and received the literature award of
her graduating class. Through Concordia’s Design for the Theatre Program, she
worked several plays put on stage by the theatre department. Most recently,
Öykü was the assistant lighting designer for Concordia’s Angels in America: A Gay
Fantasia on National Themes. Currently, she is working on Concordia’s
adaptation of Antigone as assistant
costume designer, and she’s designing a production of Partners in Crime, which will be staged in Farsi at the Espace
4001.
Mishelle Lam Designer




Mishelle is an artist based in Montreal and Toronto. As a visual artist for most her life, her interest naturally developed towards theatre. She is currently in her third year as a student specializing in Theatre Design at Concordia University in Montreal. She enjoys set and lighting design, and she would love to pursue that further in her career. Mishelle has worked on a few small productions as the key designer for set, costume, and props. Now in the New Year, she is currently designing two shows, both being held in Montreal.
When she is not designing, Mishelle spends her time in the theatre as a technician. She has volunteered as one on many productions, and was employed as a Rover technician for the Montreal Fringe Festival. She would like to invite you to come see Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, as it is a rich and haunting story that is relevant to our time. Please come and support local theatre, and join us as we experience this story together.


Vanessa Zaurrini Sound Designer 




Vanessa likes making sounds, recording sounds, and unintentionally waking her neighbours up with said sounds in a charming unending serenade at 3 in the morning. Far from a hobby, Vanessa’s sound design and music composition has appeared in many interdisciplinary projects ranging from live design for dance at LeCollab’Art, to Concordia’s Angels in America and 60x60. She also composes for indie video games, films and animations. As a member of The Concordia Laptop Orchestra (CLOrk), she enjoys collaborating with other musicians in eclectic performances, and can additionally be found singing and playing bass with her band. She is currently completing a BFA in Electroacoustics at Concordia.

Ulayu Sequaluk Make Up Artist

Based in Montreal, Ulayu has a passion for the business and a knack for special-effect transformations. She's been gaining experience by working steadily in Theatre, and honing her skills at Collège Inter-De.

<p>Close your eyes. Imagine a moment in your life when you had

<p>Feline Entertainment with head kitten Tiger RoxXx (Sky

successful shows since 2008. In the history of the scores of projects that
have graced stages up and down the east coast the three main principles that have
kept the community, artists, and these productions going strong together have
been:</p>
<p>1) FUN ~ have fun, be fun, share fun</p>
<p>2) CARE ~ care about what you do, who you do it with, and
the audience you do it for</p>
<p>3) GIVE ~ give it all on stage, give back to the entertainment
community and to the community that supports you!</p>
<p>These
principles allow amazing shows full of amazing performers year after year! We
have been saving the '<b><i><u>princesses self

ready to put on the show of our lifetimes! That means we need some Fairie Good
Parents to help us out!</p>
<p>We
have been accepted to the 2015 Greensboro Fringe Festival. (this will be our

International Fringe festival (<a href=""http://www.greensborofringefestival.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.greensborofringefestival.org</a> ) is a
showcase of the cities best ‘fringe’ arts, bringing a variety of styles of
artist interpretations to the city during a two week period of time~ in 2015 it
will be held in January and February. We are always proud to be a part of such
an amazing showcase of talent and are ready to bring it! This year our
offerings are not only artistically intense, but their message is emotionally
amazing… when you add the fact that we would like to couple with Girls Rock NC
(<a href=""http://www.girlsrocknc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.girlsrocknc.org</a>) by giving our tickets proceeds to support their
cause makes the moral of these stories and your heart sing! If you don’t know about Girls Rock NC… well, they ROCK. They are an organization that that empowers girls and women -- through creative expression -- to become confident and engaged members of our communities. They accomplish this by focusing on the “three Cs”: creativity, confidence and collaboration. </p><p>That’s why we need
your help. If we can crowdfund our overhead costs, then all the money and
awareness we raise goes straight to our charity. In the past we have beat the
streets going door to door asking for support to be able to raise enough to
cover our overhead costs, but let’s face it, it’s 2014 and with the internet crowdfunding is the way to go! This method is more efficient and better for
everyone involved. We still draw a great deal of awareness to the Girls Rock NC through our crowdfunding, while raising money to do what we love in our
performance, so we can in turn give the money we earn back to them! </p>
<p>Where will this money go?</p>
<p>Well, as we said before we want to give all
the tickets sales to our charity, plus keep our ticket prices affordable so
that everyone that wants to see the show can! That means we are crowdfunding
for our overhead costs… they break down pretty easy.</p><p>We also will be doing a benefit burlesque show on December 19th at Club Orion 4618 W Market St, Greensboro, NC 27407! All proceeds of this show will go towards the overhead costs of the Fringe show as well!

<p>This year 
<b><i><u>Not
your mother's fairie tales~ a princesses self love story! </u></i></b> will be performed at the
beautiful Carolina Theatre upstairs in the Crown. The rental there for two
nights fully staffed will take about a little over a third of what we are
asking in crowdfunding. Then we will be building a moderate set, nothing to
cheap… but not too fancy and some bang up costuming, which will take another
third. To run a production like this there are always costs people don’t think
about from the cost of creating the incentives down to running ads and printing
posters, so the last third will go into a lot of miscellaneous production
overhead costs. I once spent $64 on glow sticks because an out of town
performer lost all her luggage and her debit card was frozen from her bank due
to out of town charges… the glow sticks were the fastest and easiest solution
for the show to go on! In that overhead cost I would also like to give this
hard working team of mine a little scratch if there is anything left, even if
it only breaks down to $50 a performer. A little appreciation goes a long way!
ALSO Any overage we receive will surely go to performer appreciation and enhanced costuming as well!</p>
<p>We are very proud to pour our hearts out on
the stage with every performance, we are even more grateful to do it for such
an amazing cause, the fact that a great community like you is willing to
support our dreams and that a circular effect can be made through out our
Universe really is astounding! Thanks! Even for just taking time to read this!
Some times thank you just doesn’t seem to say enough… so hopefully we can show
you just how we grateful we feel by putting on the most amazing show we know
how! </p>

<h3>Why Improvisation?</h3>
<p>In my recent practice as a dance artist, I’ve moved passed an identity as a dancer and begun to consider what it means to be a human with a body who dances. In my recent training at the San Francisco Conservatory of Dance, my perspective as a dancer shifted to that of a storyteller, sensitive to the diverging details that shape every story, ones I gained access to in and through the body and in collaboration with others. These details include the struggle for power and vulnerability and the emotional reality of the human being. My role as a researcher built upon my role as a storyteller, of the body, its function, and as a surveyor of my habits and personality traits in my assessment of the former to track my progress.</p>
<p>In my recent experiences as an art teacher, I have learned useful lessons in the dance studio that apply to teaching students in a classroom. I have a deeper understanding of the individuality of my student's learning needs, and cultivate an environment where experimentation and risk taking is rewarded. I am consciously working to observe my student's habits and patterns in their modes of thinking, ways they begin a project, ways they talk about and perceive creative work, and ways of communicating with me and one another. I am interested in understanding the ways dance can serve as a useful tool in other art forms and modes of learning. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Little More on Contact Improvisation!</h3>
<p>Contact Improvisation is an evolving system of movement initiated in 1972 by American choreographer Steve Paxton. The improvised dance form is based on the communication between two moving bodies that are in physical contact and their combined relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion—gravity, momentum, inertia. The body, in order to open to these sensations, learns to release excess muscular tension and abandon a certain quality of willfulness to experience the natural flow of movement. Practice includes rolling, falling, being upside down, following a physical point of contact, supporting and giving weight to a partner</p>
<p>(defined by Steve Paxton and others, from Contact Quarterly website)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A Video of Contact Improvisation!</h3>
<p>Chris Aiken, Ray Chung and Mike Vargas perform at Judson Church in NYC.</p>
<p>Click <a href=""https://youtu.be/PWR8qwxwUU4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a>!!!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>A Little More on Nancy!</strong></h3>
<p>Nancy Stark Smith’s training as an athlete and gymnast led her to study and perform modern and postmodern dance in the early 1970s, greatly influenced by the dance/theater improvisation group the Grand Union and the Judson Dance Theater breakthroughs of the 1960s in NYC. She graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in dance and writing. In 1972, she danced in the first performances of Contact Improvisation in NYC and has since been central to its development as a dancer, teacher, performer, organizer, and writer/publisher, working extensively over the years with Steve Paxton and others. She travels throughout the world teaching and performing contact and other improvised dance work at festivals, schools, and art centers, working with many favorite dance partners and performance makers including Ray Chung, Karen Nelson, Andrew Harwood, Julyen Hamilton, and musician Mike Vargas.</p>
<p>In 1975 she cofounded <i>Contact Quarterly, a vehicle for moving ideas</i>, an international dance and improvisational journal. To continue reading her bio click <a href=""http://nancystarksmith.com/biography"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p><strong>The entire cost of the intensive is around $1,705.</strong></p>
<p>$1,575 of that goes to Nancy Stark Smith and the individuals hosting the intensive, and to EARTHDANCE for room and board, who’s vision is to create a vibrant, curious, and equitable society grounded in social justice, healthy community living, embodied movement, and ecological stewardship.</p>
<p>The other $130 is for transportation to and from EARTHDANCE, a special dinner after the workshop in North Hampton at the end of the intensive, and for laundry.  The extra $295 is to help cover part of my rent back in Brooklyn for the month of February. I’ve discovered a way to survive in New York City as an artist, but it means living paycheck to paycheck. I will be away from both my jobs for three weeks, unable to earn enough money in the month of January to pay for February’s rent. I am doing what I can to make as much money before hand, but am factoring in this safety net just in case things get tight.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my entire goal, I risk missing the opportunity to participate in the intensive. If I don’t reach at least 50% of my goal, I will use the funds I raise to get myself to EARTHDANCE to take class, where I can stay for as many days as I can afford.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My training forced me to consider what remains overlooked in a dancer’s practice that informs our humanity and shapes the scope of our influence on the world; <i>the rigor of work in the face of exhaustion, perseverance in the face of judgment, the value of treating practice as performance, embracing failure as essential to growth, and confrontation of the unknown. </i></p>
<p>The San Francisco Conservatory of Dance introduced me to improvisation as a form that allows constant discovery and a changing landscape in which to work. One of my teachers, Christian Burns exemplifies these attributes.  He invites his students into the space to work alongside him. He is a patient and considerate teacher, which is visible in his study and practice of improvisation. His teachings on improvisation helped dis-indoctrinate me from a right or wrong mentality—a mentality that substantially limits my ability to progress, my willingness to take risks in service of a greater vision, and my belief in myself, which affects the work I am able to do.</p>
<p>This ongoing discovery clarifies the nature of my craft and strengthens my voice, which is articulated by my body, outside of the realm of language. It gives me the tools to deepen my understanding of embodied knowledge and allows greater insight into other art forms such as drawing, printmaking, and conceptual studies.

<p>Contact Improvisation bridged communities through the building and strengthening of trust, through the cultivation of self-reliance as a product of deep listening, and encourages fearlessness through a creative endeavor.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenges will be the physical and emotional demands of the intensive. Dancing 40+ hours a week in a highly physical form will be challenging for my mental and physical stamina. I will also be challenged by the collaboration the form requires, a prolonged focus that will require deep listening and attentiveness. I will be challenged by the physical limitations of the body and the intensity of the three week practice of the form.</p>
<p>I believe I am fit to take on these challenges because they are the same reasons I want to attend the intensive. I want to experience a nine hour day in which I focus on the continuity of channeling fearlessness, and selflessness. I aim to become more intuitive, more patient and a better listener within my improvisation practice. I am driven to break habitual movement patterns in search for a more organic flow that is at the center of Contact Improvisation. The circumstances defined by the structure, environment and participants of this intensive will present a unique set of challenges that allow me to work on these goals, . </p>
<p>And I am ready for the challenges! One of the most valuable things Summer Lee Rhatigan taught me at the San Francisco Conservatory is how to work. She taught me that dancing often requires more mental preparation than physical. She taught me the importance of pushing past what you believe is your limit, because you are very often surprised by what you will find when you do. She taught me the body is resilient and stubborn, able to take over control when the mind falters, and to trust it when it does. She taught me how to rely on it. She taught me how to learn new things about myself and discover . She taught me the value of falling and failing. </p>
<p>The training I received at the San Francisco Conservatory of Dance has allowed me to develop a new kind of relationship to challenges. It has taught me to expect and welcome them, for they are part of all meaningful work.</p>

</div><p>THANK YOU!!! </p></div>","Why Improvisation?
In my recent practice as a dance artist, I’ve moved passed an identity as a dancer and begun to consider what it means to be a human with a body who dances. In my recent training at the San Francisco Conservatory of Dance, my perspective as a dancer shifted to that of a storyteller, sensitive to the diverging details that shape every story, ones I gained access to in and through the body and in collaboration with others. These details include the struggle for power and vulnerability and the emotional reality of the human being. My role as a researcher built upon my role as a storyteller, of the body, its function, and as a surveyor of my habits and personality traits in my assessment of the former to track my progress.
In my recent experiences as an art teacher, I have learned useful lessons in the dance studio that apply to teaching students in a classroom. I have a deeper understanding of the individuality of my student's learning needs, and cultivate an environment where experimentation and risk taking is rewarded. I am consciously working to observe my student's habits and patterns in their modes of thinking, ways they begin a project, ways they talk about and perceive creative work, and ways of communicating with me and one another. I am interested in understanding the ways dance can serve as a useful tool in other art forms and modes of learning. 
 
A Little More on Contact Improvisation!
Contact Improvisation is an evolving system of movement initiated in 1972 by American choreographer Steve Paxton. The improvised dance form is based on the communication between two moving bodies that are in physical contact and their combined relationship to the physical laws that govern their motion—gravity, momentum, inertia. The body, in order to open to these sensations, learns to release excess muscular tension and abandon a certain quality of willfulness to experience the natural flow of movement. Practice includes rolling, falling, being upside down, following a physical point of contact, supporting and giving weight to a partner
(defined by Steve Paxton and others, from Contact Quarterly website)

A Little More on Nancy!
Nancy Stark Smith’s training as an athlete and gymnast led her to study and perform modern and postmodern dance in the early 1970s, greatly influenced by the dance/theater improvisation group the Grand Union and the Judson Dance Theater breakthroughs of the 1960s in NYC. She graduated from Oberlin College with a degree in dance and writing. In 1972, she danced in the first performances of Contact Improvisation in NYC and has since been central to its development as a dancer, teacher, performer, organizer, and writer/publisher, working extensively over the years with Steve Paxton and others. She travels throughout the world teaching and performing contact and other improvised dance work at festivals, schools, and art centers, working with many favorite dance partners and performance makers including Ray Chung, Karen Nelson, Andrew Harwood, Julyen Hamilton, and musician Mike Vargas.
In 1975 she cofounded Contact Quarterly, a vehicle for moving ideas, an international dance and improvisational journal. To continue reading her bio click here!
 

What I Need & What You Get!
The entire cost of the intensive is around $1,705.
$1,575 of that goes to Nancy Stark Smith and the individuals hosting the intensive, and to EARTHDANCE for room and board, who’s vision is to create a vibrant, curious, and equitable society grounded in social justice, healthy community living, embodied movement, and ecological stewardship.
The other $130 is for transportation to and from EARTHDANCE, a special dinner after the workshop in North Hampton at the end of the intensive, and for laundry.  The extra $295 is to help cover part of my rent back in Brooklyn for the month of February. I’ve discovered a way to survive in New York City as an artist, but it means living paycheck to paycheck. I will be away from both my jobs for three weeks, unable to earn enough money in the month of January to pay for February’s rent. I am doing what I can to make as much money before hand, but am factoring in this safety net just in case things get tight.
If I don’t reach my entire goal, I risk missing the opportunity to participate in the intensive. If I don’t reach at least 50% of my goal, I will use the funds I raise to get myself to EARTHDANCE to take class, where I can stay for as many days as I can afford. However, this means I will not be able to work with Nancy Stark Smith or the other 22 participants attending.
I will thank everyone who contributes to this campaign, and send a personal thank you to anyone who donates over $25 dollars! Other perks include detailed notes taken throughout the intensive, photos take and creative writing written during the intensive, personalized improvisational scores, written AND performed for backers, a film in which three of the scores will be featured, and an ORIGINAL limited edition print created for this occasion!

</div></div>","What is THE MAGNUS EFFECT?

The Magnus Effect is a gutsy new theatre piece, written by Hannah Van Sciver and produced by The Greenfield Collective, premiering in Philadelphia this July. It tells the story of five unlikely strangers who come together with a common goal: overcoming their fear of flying. ​One part play, one part dance and one part airline jingle, The Magnus Effect is an exploration of how and why we've come to dread the world around us. 


Why you can feel especially AWESOME about this play:

It features a diverse cast and production team of some of the finest emerging talent in Philadelphia.

We are providing free tickets for student theatre makers through Philadelphia Young Playwrights.

The Magnus Effect deals with mental health in an unconventional and nuanced way. We are reaching out to great organizations like HealthyMinds Philly, in order to make resources available to folks who might want to get involved with mental health in Philly, post-show.

Each performance will have a pre-show act, featuring a local artist sharing original work centering on the theme of anxiety.

We are very grateful for your support and belief in us and our persistence to figure out how to make new work, make it well, and make it with an impact.

Each of the eight performers on stage has to act, play music, and perform movement just about the entire time.

Put any remaining money towards touring (we think ahead!) We want to make this work accessible, and a part of that is offering a sliding scale ticket and not depending on show income to compensate our team.  We know your time is valuable, and with your help we hope to start a sustainable model of funding future tours of the work using net profits from ticket sales, so that it can reach more communities without new crowdfunding campaigns each time. RISKS/CHALLENGESPutting Ourselves Out ThereWe have paid the down payment for the theatre. This show can’t happen without you.We’ve put a lot of our own personal money, health, intellect, creative drive, and intense emotions into developing this work, and we need your help for the last step. We are very grateful for your support and belief in us and our persistence to figure out how to make new work, make it well, and make it with an impact. Making art is scary, and asking for support and faith is even scarier...But, we can’t do it alone.  How Hard the Show IsThis show, even though it is only an hour, is an absolute marathon for the performers. Each of the eight performers on stage has to act, play music, and perform movement just about the entire time. That, coupled with the intensity of a tennis-court style seating arrangement and a strong artistic vision make the work extremely detailed and difficult to perform. With the real challenges of time and expense of New York City, we are sweating our way through the summer to make this work incendiary for the audience.  The Conversation Thoughts &Prayers is important, not only because it is being delivered by a team of first-rate artists, but because it is theatre for a cause. We are offering youth workshops. We are devoting a percentage of ticket sales to an organization (chosen with the help of our supporters) dedicated to proactive disaster support.We are also putting money earned from the show straight towards touring, so we can commit to engaging with more communities. This is more than an art piece, it is an ongoing conversation. It’s important, but it’s a terrifying amount of work to undertake, and important to do so with thoughtfulness.  The FutureWe are a very small non-profit determined to make a difference, but we are working on very little money and the (wo)man-hours add up. With your help, we will be able to take the right steps to secure a future for this work and for future workshop programming dedicated to activist art paired with top-notch professional artists. Thank you for supporting us, it means the world to our team.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>ABOUT THE PLAY: </p>
<p><i>Relationships are hard. Mouse infestations are even harder.</i></p>
<p><i>Join Claire and Hugh as they balance both: expertly avoiding emotional baggage, navigating painful interactions with over-the-top exes, and concealing small furry corpses in strategic hiding places. But as the body count rises, Clare and Hugh struggle to ignore the secrets between them (that and the overpowering stench of rotting flesh). Is romance the greatest exterminator of them all? Or is this one infestation that won't be contained...</i></p>
<p>Emily and Lauren have been developing this play over the past two years with support from Exquisite Corpse Company and The Drama League. The LPAC Rough Draft Festival is the first time this play is receiving a fully designed workshop production. </p>
<p><strong><u>Our LPAC Rough Draft team:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Featuring</strong>: Gabby Beans, Tim Nicolai*, Lowell Byers*, &amp; Lauren LaRocca* </p>
<p><strong>Designed by</strong>: Isabelle Coler, Kate Marvin, Carolina Ortiz, Christopher M. Thompson, &amp; Michaela Whiting.</p>
<p><strong>Production team: </strong>Brittany Crowell, Gabriela Gowdie.</p>
<p>(*indicates AEA)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We just need 1,000 more dollars to reach our budget goal. These funds will directly support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist fees for our 4 actors, scenic designer, lighting designer, sound designer, costume designer, properties designer, stage manager and production manager.</li>
<li>Additional material costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we are only able to offer a small stipend to our creative team for this process, we believe that every little bit counts in showing our appreciation and respect for their time and craft.</p>
<p>Any additional funding that does not go directly to the artists will be used to supplement our scenic, properties, and costume materials budget. </p>

<h3>Who are CellarDoor Theatre?</h3>
<p>CellarDoor Theatre is a company run by Theatre Makers Teja Boocock, Akshay Khanna and Hiranya Griffith-Unny - along with our board of associate artists! A band of keen theatre devotees and enthusiasts, the CDT team have individually strived to create lively and entertaining theatre, and, having banded our creative minds together, we hope to create even better shows on a larger scale than anything we’ve done before.</p>
<p><strong>TEJA BOOCOCK:</strong></p>
<p>Teja Boocock is a meticulous young director. Her passion came early on in life, when she was tasked with directing her primary school production and put on Sarah Kane’s ‘Crave’ to an audience of bewildered parents. Critics called it ‘no comment’ and ‘what the f*ck?’, and it received a three-star review from Epigram. Since then, she has directed countless shows, including an international tour of ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ at the age of 18 (a fact she is loath to let anyone forget).</p>
<p><strong>AKSHAY KHANNA:</strong></p>
<p>Akshay Khanna spends most of his time (as his father so eloquently puts it) ‘twatting about on stage’ rather than living in the real world. Having recently been accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, he is provided the prospect of theatre being a legitimate career, which is exciting for him and mildly terrifying for his family and friends. He could have been a doctor, or a lawyer, or an engineer, or a CEO, if he wasn’t so blatantly terrified of success or achieving the living wage.</p>
<p><strong>HIRANYA GRIFFITH-UNNY:</strong></p>
<p>Hiranya Griffith-Unny is the most boring and least edgy person we have had the misfortune of drearily sitting through a production meeting with, if we even manage to register that she’s in the room in the first place, the tedious sod. Describing Hiranya as milquetoast is singularly apt, since milk and toast are the only forms of nourishment she partakes of.  Indeed, the only thing remotely remarkable about Hiranya Griffith-Unny is her name, and it’s not like she chose it herself.  No, that would have been interesting. Wait... why do we let her design our shows again?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can see from our portfolio, if we are one thing - it is ambitious. And, much to our eternal regret, ambition costs - and so we reach out to the public to help us make the shows we have floating around in our heads a reality.</p>
<p>Whether you believe in the people behind this project, really want to see the show itself, or have a vested interest in backing something wondeful - then don’t hesitate to contribute!</p>
<p>The majority of donations from this platform will go towards renting the venue for the performance dates, which is a fairly large portion of the budget.  The rest will be raised independently.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions are most graciously accepted (though larger contributions will be accepted with EVEN MORE grace than that) and we are extremely grateful for any support we receive.</p>
<p>Whilst we have already raised £3000, we need to raise an additional £1000 in order to ensure that we can afford a venue for the run of the show. The money raised from your kind donations will be spent exclusively on this, giving us the remaining funds to ensure that the finished production is to the highest possible artistic standard.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In this time of great economic uncertainty for the arts, the only way for young theatre companies to develop, grow and expand their artistic capabilities is with the support of an equally dedicated base of theatre lovers. CellarDoor's artists do not take a salary from their work with the group; every penny raised is invested into our productions! With your support, we can help develop the next generation of theatre makers and their work, giving people the chance to see and experience new and innovative theatre at a reasonable price. </p>
<p>Bristol is a city known for its vibrant and rapidly growing artistic community. As part of this community, CellarDoor has built up a successful track record of previous sell-out productions including 2018's 'Edwards Gant's Amazing Feats of Loneliness', and 2017's productions of 'Frankenstein' and 'The Corpse Bride'. We always endeavor to bring something new to our audiences and have forged artistic partnerships with the University of Bristol, Screenology, Bristol Old Vic and more!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with all theatre, there is a risk that turnout may be lower than we'd like. However, unlike other campaigns, we can assure that there is no risk of your money going to waste. We will be performing 'The Tragical Tale of Doctor Faustus' in early 2019, and your money will be spent on making sure that we can free the funds we need to refine and develop other aspects of the show by ensuring that we secure a suitable venue. We've never lost money on a show, and have consistently sold out nearly all of our performances.</p>
