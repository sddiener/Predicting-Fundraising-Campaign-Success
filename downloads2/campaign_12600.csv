<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>* Some of the earliest comics I remember are the stack of DELL comics my maternal grandmother and great-grandmother had kept. (Mom's super-hero and horror comics apparently sold fast at a rummage sale.) Those scattered issues of Four Color really helped build up the love of comics I have to this day and the inspiration for me to enter the industry, focusing on genres beyond capes and tights.  As I got older, I learned more of the industry's history and what became of DELL after they parted ways with Western Publishing. It was there I learned about the crew that would become <strong>SECTION: M</strong>. <br/>    DELL still chugged along doing TV and movie tie-ins, but when Batman became the surprise hit of 1966, their lack of super-heroes became a liability at the newsstand. Having produced one-shots of Frankenstein and Dracula, loosely based on the Universal films, the editors reasoned that if kids liked monsters and they liked super-heroes, why not combine the two? The results were... <i>interesting</i>. But they also had a certain charm.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540913477/knkh1zglnzoiw2bexqgb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>  FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA, WEREWOLF... Plus more traditional hero types like NUKLA and the FAB 4 may not have been as slick as DC, as ""in your face"" as Marvel or have the mix of nostalgia and camp the Archie hero revival had, but they had <i>something</i>. These characters had POTENTIAL. They stayed with you and you would think, ""Maybe if they had..."" But as time went on and DELL was broken up and sold off, the characters were abandoned. </p>
<p><strong>SECTION: M</strong>  is the result of my adopting these orphaned characters and trying to help them reach that potential. Picking them up as if their books had made it beyond the 4-6 issue runs in the mid-60s and bringing them into the 21st Century. With art by the team of Federico Zumel and Stuart Berryhill and a standard cover by Ron Joseph (<i>GI Joe</i> and <i>ROM</i> from IDW), we hope to bring you a mix of old school storytelling with a modern flair with some of the WILDEST characters to ever grace the pages. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540913521/n0jwsjhdjbcgcxeoitpb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As for why Indiegogo after two successful Kickstarters? Kickstarter is great, but as I looked at recent trends, it seems the super hero-style projects have struggled there of late. We're on a mission to make this book happen and feel IndieGoGo is the best place to do it. </p>
<h3>Who's Involved?</h3>
<p>Sean Dulaney is the writer and instigator of the project. Breaking in as an artist in Mike Hoffman's TIGRESS TALES PIN-UP BOOK, he transitioned to writing, launching <i>Dreah, Queen of Thieves</i>, <i>F. Stein: Consulting Detective</i> and <i>Kendar the Jungle Lord</i> in DIGITAL WEBBING PRESENTS. His involvement in Platinum Studios' ""<i>Comic Book Challenge</i>"" led to creation of the 51 DELTA graphic novel for Arcana. Recent projects include SUPERSONIC for Arcana, MISS VICKY and her CUTIE COMMANDOS with his Bimor Comics imprint and THE ""IT"" GIRL MURDERS coming in 2019 from Markosia.    </p>

<p>Penciler Federico Zumel is an Argentinean comic book artist who has been working for the US market for 17 years, working for companies like Penny Farthing Press, Approbation Comics, Forcewerks,PicklePress, Bughouse Comics, Advent Comics and Big City Comics; as well for many independent writers and creators. His influences go from Marc Silvestri, Greg Capullo and Claudio Castelllini to Milton Caniff, Alex Raymond and Stan Drake.</p>

<p>Stuart Berryhill is inking a second project with Sean, having worked on THE ""IT"" GIRL MURDERS over pencils by Kurt Belcher. He's no stranger to the Monster Heroes, having penciled and inked the first meeting of Frankenstein and Dracula in CELEBRATION COMICS #2</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Plain and simple, our initial goal covers the cost of production. That's the pencils, inks, letters and colors. The printing cost will be dictated by the final number of physical copies needed and a portion of an initial print run has been built in to our starting goal as well. Rather than overload you with variants, we're starting with one by Ryan Sergeant (<i>Dreah</i>, 51 DELTA) and a blank cover for sketches. We also are breaking into the vault for some of the early appearances we've done with the characters</p>
<p>""But what if you get the goal early on?""   </p>
<p>We have a few stretch goals planned. The initial stretch goal will be at $3500, where we will add a back-up story featuring the first meeting of Dracula '66 and Frankenstein (originally presented in CELEBRATION COMICS #2) presented in color for the first time. </p>
<ul>
<li>At $4000, we will unlock a second series of action stickers of the characters.</li>
<li>At $4500, the DRACULA '66 collector pin is unlocked. </li>
<li>Beyond that... Well, we've got to have a few surprises.  </li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Summary
* Some of the earliest comics I remember are the stack of DELL comics my maternal grandmother and great-grandmother had kept. (Mom's super-hero and horror comics apparently sold fast at a rummage sale.) Those scattered issues of Four Color really helped build up the love of comics I have to this day and the inspiration for me to enter the industry, focusing on genres beyond capes and tights.  As I got older, I learned more of the industry's history and what became of DELL after they parted ways with Western Publishing. It was there I learned about the crew that would become SECTION: M.     DELL still chugged along doing TV and movie tie-ins, but when Batman became the surprise hit of 1966, their lack of super-heroes became a liability at the newsstand. Having produced one-shots of Frankenstein and Dracula, loosely based on the Universal films, the editors reasoned that if kids liked monsters and they liked super-heroes, why not combine the two? The results were... interesting. But they also had a certain charm.  

  FRANKENSTEIN, DRACULA, WEREWOLF... Plus more traditional hero types like NUKLA and the FAB 4 may not have been as slick as DC, as ""in your face"" as Marvel or have the mix of nostalgia and camp the Archie hero revival had, but they had something. These characters had POTENTIAL. They stayed with you and you would think, ""Maybe if they had..."" But as time went on and DELL was broken up and sold off, the characters were abandoned. 
SECTION: M  is the result of my adopting these orphaned characters and trying to help them reach that potential. Picking them up as if their books had made it beyond the 4-6 issue runs in the mid-60s and bringing them into the 21st Century. With art by the team of Federico Zumel and Stuart Berryhill and a standard cover by Ron Joseph (GI Joe and ROM from IDW), we hope to bring you a mix of old school storytelling with a modern flair with some of the WILDEST characters to ever grace the pages. 

As for why Indiegogo after two successful Kickstarters? Kickstarter is great, but as I looked at recent trends, it seems the super hero-style projects have struggled there of late. We're on a mission to make this book happen and feel IndieGoGo is the best place to do it. 
Who's Involved?
Sean Dulaney is the writer and instigator of the project. Breaking in as an artist in Mike Hoffman's TIGRESS TALES PIN-UP BOOK, he transitioned to writing, launching Dreah, Queen of Thieves, F. Stein: Consulting Detective and Kendar the Jungle Lord in DIGITAL WEBBING PRESENTS. His involvement in Platinum Studios' ""Comic Book Challenge"" led to creation of the 51 DELTA graphic novel for Arcana. Recent projects include SUPERSONIC for Arcana, MISS VICKY and her CUTIE COMMANDOS with his Bimor Comics imprint and THE ""IT"" GIRL MURDERS coming in 2019 from Markosia.    

Penciler Federico Zumel is an Argentinean comic book artist who has been working for the US market for 17 years, working for companies like Penny Farthing Press, Approbation Comics, Forcewerks,PicklePress, Bughouse Comics, Advent Comics and Big City Comics; as well for many independent writers and creators. His influences go from Marc Silvestri, Greg Capullo and Claudio Castelllini to Milton Caniff, Alex Raymond and Stan Drake.

Stuart Berryhill is inking a second project with Sean, having worked on THE ""IT"" GIRL MURDERS over pencils by Kurt Belcher. He's no stranger to the Monster Heroes, having penciled and inked the first meeting of Frankenstein and Dracula in CELEBRATION COMICS #2

What We Need & What You Get
Plain and simple, our initial goal covers the cost of production. That's the pencils, inks, letters and colors. The printing cost will be dictated by the final number of physical copies needed and a portion of an initial print run has been built in to our starting goal as well. Rather than overload you with variants, we're starting with one by Ryan Sergeant (Dreah, 51 DELTA) and a blank cover for sketches. We also are breaking into the vault for some of the early appearances we've done with the characters
""But what if you get the goal early on?""   
We have a few stretch goals planned. The initial stretch goal will be at $3500, where we will add a back-up story featuring the first meeting of Dracula '66 and Frankenstein (originally presented in CELEBRATION COMICS #2) presented in color for the first time. 

At $4000, we will unlock a second series of action stickers of the characters.
At $4500, the DRACULA '66 collector pin is unlocked. 
Beyond that... Well, we've got to have a few surprises.

<p>Star of Destiny is a <b>serial fantasy/action comic</b> about Star, a teenage sorceress-in-training from the tiny village of Taloz. <i>Having grown up in a remote village, Star has seen her home as a cage. She dreams of seeing the outside world and has trained to be a sorceress for that day, even seeking out to become an apprentice to one of the greatest sorceress of the land. The day she turns of age, Star's hope becomes reality when she's invited to be tested for apprenticeship. However, everything goes wrong when the King of Narovia - a crazed man who brings destruction where he goes for seemingly no reason - decides to trap her within his plans and to target the home she left behind.</i></p>
<p>Done in a Japanese comic style, typically known as manga, Star of Destiny was the first story I ever created. It's changed a lot from my early days of story writing and has always remained my favourite story to write. This is actually a reboot for Star of Destiny as the first version made comic form was not the best. Now Star of Destiny is arguably one of my best stories, which is good since the story has so much meaning to me. Not only was it the first one I ever made, but a lot of its early development and ideas (many of which are still being used) came at a rather important period in my life. I wouldn't be on this course to be a writer if I didn't meet the people I did at that time, make the decisions I made and ultimately created this story.</p>
<p>If you want to see what it's all about, you can read the first chapter (aka the very thing we're printing here) for free on Tapastic:</p>

<div>Campaigns like this often come with risks and challenges to them. After all, this is a fairly new comic that's running here. While this is the first print run for Star of Destiny, it's not my first produced comic nor my first print run. During a previous campaign for another story, I learned a great deal on producing and printing graphic novels. We had a few hiccups that delayed things during production and even a few in printing. However, the experience taught me how to work to keep production going and get printing done faster. While the chapter is done, the comic strips being done as a bonus are still to be made. As such, these lessons will play a big part in keeping things on track.</div>
<div>Beyond this, the biggest challenge comes not from the production of chapter/issue, posters and buttons, since our printers are, for the most part, ready to go. Our real challenge is if we can produce a story that you enjoy. This is our ultimate goal and is an ongoing challenge. However, this is something we can accomplish. Everyone involved in Star of Destiny's comic has experience writing, making comics or both, giving us a lot of feedback on what does and doesn't work. We're going to be constantly looking at what makes things interesting and entertaining to readers, while also ensuring the story being told is one we like. As for you, you can find out right now if you're interested by reading what we've released of the first chapter over on Tapastic!</div>
<div><a href=""https://tapastic.com/series/starofdestiny"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://tapastic.com/series/starofdestiny</a></div> <p>So let's say you like what you see so far. You might be wondering what you can do to help and how much it can impact this project. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Well for starters, you can back us here! Financial backing is the biggest and clearest sign that people are interested in Star of Destiny and want to see more. The more we raise, the more we can do. While our goal only gets us to print, going beyond it lets us continue to make more of Star of Destiny at a much faster rate than we'd otherwise be able to (we'll be listing what we need to produce and print each chapter up to the production of a full volume as stretch goals once we've worked out the numbers, so you can personally see how much we need to keep going).</span></p>
<p>If you're unable to contribute, what you can also do is spread the word: tell your friends and family about us, share our campaign online using the Indiegogo share tools, and overall help us get known. The more people who come through this campaign while it's active, the more likely we are to find new readers. New readers also means we're more likely to hit our goal and beyond. In short, most of the power  of this campaign resides with you!</p>
<p>So if you want to see Star of Destiny be a thing, back our campaign, share us with everyone you know and let your voices be heard!</p>

He's worked on several independent comics and in 2013 won an award with Silent Manga Audition, an open competition held by Coamix for Japanese style comics with no spoken dialogue. I also had my friend Christine Chong, otherwise known as Mayshing and the character artist for Snowbound from its second chapter and on, handle drafting of Star of Destiny. The resulting style is an odd mix of Erwin's and Christine's works. I'm also working with another friend and the creator of the webcomic Moonlight Apparition, Janaka Davis. Janaka is acting as editor for Star of Destiny and will also be making a couple of short comics that will be exclusive to backers of this campaign!



   


For this campaign, we're looking to raise $1200 USD. Here's where the money goes:




$630 (52.5%) goes to printing the first chapter/issue in book form and covering the extra comics being made by Janaka Davis.


$200 (16.7%) goes towards rewards fulfillment, getting any required art made and printing physical rewards (except the issue/book, which is covered above)

$120 (10%) goes to Indiegogo and Paypal for processing fees. Indiegogo takes 5% while Paypal takes 3-5% collectively, meaning it can be up to $120.


$250 (20.8%) goes to shipping for physical rewards. If we go over our goal, the amount used for shipping will go up to cover shipping more issues/books. If this amount seems high, that's because I live in Canada and Canada is ridiculous for shipping.



For perks, we have a variety of things we're offering to backers, with more to be added if we hit stretch goals! Here's a list of what you can currently get (more will be added if we hit stretch goals):


A high-quality digital wallpaper of Star of Skye at three difference sizes to fit the three most common resolution ratios - 4:3, 16:9 and 16:10

A pair of 1.25"" buttons, featuring miniaturized-styled artwork of Star and Skye respectively.

An 11x17"" poster print of Star and Skye!

A printed copy of the first chapter of Star of Destiny, complete with bonus comic strips written and drawn by Janaka Davis. Most of these strips will be exclusive to backers and not appear in other prints.

A cameo in our next chapter as a citizen of Star's village, Taloz!


So what are our tiers? Well, the tiers look something like this:

Rewards Guide:


Any bonuses we get thanks to stretch goals will be placed at a specific spot, but if you're going for a smaller goal and want a specific stretch goal bonus, you can donate a specific amount for it.









    

Campaigns like this often come with risks and challenges to them. After all, this is a fairly new comic that's running here. While this is the first print run for Star of Destiny, it's not my first produced comic nor my first print run. During a previous campaign for another story, I learned a great deal on producing and printing graphic novels. We had a few hiccups that delayed things during production and even a few in printing. However, the experience taught me how to work to keep production going and get printing done faster. While the chapter is done, the comic strips being done as a bonus are still to be made. As such, these lessons will play a big part in keeping things on track.
Beyond this, the biggest challenge comes not from the production of chapter/issue, posters and buttons, since our printers are, for the most part, ready to go. Our real challenge is if we can produce a story that you enjoy. This is our ultimate goal and is an ongoing challenge. However, this is something we can accomplish. Everyone involved in Star of Destiny's comic has experience writing, making comics or both, giving us a lot of feedback on what does and doesn't work. We're going to be constantly looking at what makes things interesting and entertaining to readers, while also ensuring the story being told is one we like. As for you, you can find out right now if you're interested by reading what we've released of the first chapter over on Tapastic!
https://tapastic.com/series/starofdestiny So let's say you like what you see so far. You might be wondering what you can do to help and how much it can impact this project. Well for starters, you can back us here! Financial backing is the biggest and clearest sign that people are interested in Star of Destiny and want to see more. The more we raise, the more we can do. While our goal only gets us to print, going beyond it lets us continue to make more of Star of Destiny at a much faster rate than we'd otherwise be able to (we'll be listing what we need to produce and print each chapter up to the production of a full volume as stretch goals once we've worked out the numbers, so you can personally see how much we need to keep going).
If you're unable to contribute, what you can also do is spread the word: tell your friends and family about us, share our campaign online using the Indiegogo share tools, and overall help us get known. The more people who come through this campaign while it's active, the more likely we are to find new readers. New readers also means we're more likely to hit our goal and beyond. In short, most of the power  of this campaign resides with you!
So if you want to see Star of Destiny be a thing, back our campaign, share us with everyone you know and let your voices be heard!",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Brad Barber, and I'm a creative story writer. Since the age of eight, I've always thought of creating or producing a comic book/manga, but I soon realized that I was better at writing creative stories than creating art so I put more time into reading literature and books instead of watching the old shows like Avatar the last air bender, and DRAGON BALL Z. I soon learned that I could not put the story I had in my mind into someone else's without the visual part of the story, so I've come up with a plan:</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I'm hiring full-time artists and illustrators to start drawing for me, and I need to pay them what they deserve. </p>
<p>I've got a whole marketing plan for when the first volume is finished, but I need the funding to be able to accomplish this.</p>
<p>You will get a story-rich, professionally-written book with beautiful drawings.  </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Your funding will provide us with the ability to dedicate more time and hire artists to release Manga on a regular basis with a set schedule. We want to get more manga out more quickly! With six previously released chapters before starting this campaign we have examples of the quality of work you will receive from Manga Impact.  We want to grow and create more stories, more importantly ensure the completion of Monkie!</p>

Of course stories should be meaningful however remain in the realm of fun entertainment. Not propaganda, nor dogma that forces consumers to accept bad elements mixed in with some good. The end goal of any product of Manga Impact is to serve as entertainment through good story telling, and nothing more.</li>

If this is successful we will be able to release chapter 7 by December, as well as be able to release multiple chapters a year moving forward! Any one who loves manga or is interested in Manga Impacts work please help by funding this campaign and allowing us to take this small manga company to the next level.

Manga impact is a small American manga company.
Funding will allow us to start collecting more artists to do more work.
This would allow us to release manga on a set schedule starting with chapter 7 this December.
We would begin announcing books regularly for release, each containing stories you will never forget!

 

What We Need & What You Get
Currently only Christian Michaelis produces all aspects of the Manga released by Manga impact. The art, story, covers, and publishing. Your funding will provide us with the ability to dedicate more time and hire artists to release Manga on a regular basis with a set schedule. We want to get more manga out more quickly! With six previously released chapters before starting this campaign we have examples of the quality of work you will receive from Manga Impact.  We want to grow and create more stories, more importantly ensure the completion of Monkie!
The goal is 50,000. This will allow us to completely focus on manga exclusively. If reached we will send all backers of perk 1 (6 chapters) the chapter 7 release in December.
If you are a backer interested in our perks!

Perk 1: receive all 6 previously released chapters!
Perk 2: own a T-shirt with original art of Monkie created for this campaign!

details:

The first issue and chapters 5 + 6 are a combined 146 pages of panels conveying a story, with some extra content included as well.
All extra funds will go to future manga projects, this is a new manga company after all with many more stories to tell.

 

Your Impact on Manga Impact!
we want to start producing Manga chapters full time!

we want to make real stories that mean something to people with characters that grow, adventures that inspire, and entertainment that entertains! At Manga Impact we feel that American entertainment has largely failed in this regard. Of course stories should be meaningful however remain in the realm of fun entertainment. Not propaganda, nor dogma that forces consumers to accept bad elements mixed in with some good. The end goal of any product of Manga Impact is to serve as entertainment through good story telling, and nothing more.
If you like our previous work we will continue to do our best to impress. We love creating manga as much as you love reading it! If you are new here we hope you like what you see. Please read the excerpt below! check to find if you're interested.


Story synopsis:
MONKIE ""a name given to her when she was kidnapped as a child"" is the irreplaceable member of a notorious bandit group, gifted/cursed with extraordinary strength after eating the forbidden fruit. Which grants great powers to those that feast upon it. One day Monkie is lead to use her abilities to turn herself and fellow bandits from thieves into conquerors. With only memory of her life as a bandit and little understanding of the world beyond it, Monkie must come to terms with the result of her sometimes villainous actions...






 
We want to show the world our stories and art, and your support is highly appreciated!
 

Risks & Challenges

Even without the full minimum amount we will provide backers with all perks ordered. Chapter 7 will not be provided in this campaign unless the full minimum amount is reached. We will still strive to complete future chapters as quickly as possible but can't guarantee any specific release date. Monkie will also remain the only manga on the Manga impact's line up until further notice.
The next chapter will be produced regardless of the result of this campaign but it will take more time. The goal is to create as many stories as possible. if we can not reach the goals of this campaign it will take much longer, but we will do all that we can.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is DS Williams I am the creator of Kayn Kourageous. I was an art teacher and I currently have a YouTube channel that was used to help motivate my students. And although it was sometimes a fulfilling experience, being an art teacher was never my calling or goal. My goal has always been to become an Illustrator and create a graphic novel.</p>
<p>I hope to get help with the completion of a story I have been working on for many years, and with your assistance, I can finish the remaining half of the story arc.</p>
<p>Kayn Kourageous is more than just a story to me it’s my life just twisted into sci-fi fantasy. It’s a story I think for anyone who likes adventure and new experiences may enjoy and with your help, I will finally get the story off the ground because there is more to come.</p>
<p>they be ready to make a contribution?</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is to raise 75000 for this project. I produce art at a large scale with a lot of detail so it takes a long time to produce panels and I have over a hundred pages to produce to finish the book. So I figured that it would take over a year to finish the book. 75000 would take care of all my essential needs expenses and materials for a year along with printing costs once everything is completed. With that amount for the project, I can work nonstop and have this book done by 2021 and release a complete volume one of Kayn Kourageous finishing the story arc.</p>

In the midst of this tumultuous time, Cyrus Lawson seeks to carve out his own quiet life, away from the chaos, on a small, out of the way settlement known as Terez. His plans are short lived, as he is caught up in the machinations of the crew of Hazard, notorious pirates in pursuit of an ultimate prize! This prize has the potential to shake the foundations of the future. Will Cyrus survive this rat race? Will he be able to win the peace he so desires?....there's one factor missing.....YOU! Modern mainstream comics are suffering from a distinct lack of action and excitement; coming layered with heavy doses of on-the-nose propaganda. Outlaw Nights is the inverse. A future based on the past, with a new landscape of threats; blended together to spark your imagination. You don't want to miss this! (Note: mature themes; not recommended for children). We are going to need to raise 10000 dollars to complete the book. It is an uphill battle, but this story is well worth it. Rest assured, if this campaign does not meet goal, all proceeds will be invested into more artwork and promotion for relaunch. This book WILL come out, one way or another!To reserve a copy, click on one of the perks and fill out your information. If you do not wish to read, but like the idea, feel free to contribute! If you like the project, but cannot afford to support, please share and spread the word to friends and family!   The design and gorgeous line work you have been witnessing is courtesy of the great Render Contender! Render is an up and coming independent artist who has been receiving a steady, and well deserved, stream of work: including Jon Malin's Graveyard Shift Volume 2!

I'm a Canadian artist who specializes in Comics and Children's illustration. I love making comics and telling life stories.  In 2008 I started a company making personalized comics called <a href=""https://www.thisisyourlifestories.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This is Your Life Stories.</a>  I witnessed the great joy they brought to my clients. The success I achieved with this venture combined with the passing of my father led me to decide to start making stories to honour the dead and to help the bereaved through their difficult time. The result was<a href=""http://lacajacomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> La Caja Comics</a>. </p><p> La Caja is Spanish for ""The Box"" and  is pronounced ""LA KA HA"" La Caja Comics are custom made celebration of Life Comics housed in a bespoke decorative box .</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506619507/mkylz9nmepewhk9vxg47.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>What's inside La CaJa?</strong></p><p>La Caja Comics is a treasure chest where you'll find items created to tell and share the story of the deceased. The contents of La Caja include a hardcover volume with a thirty page graphic novel that tells the life story of the deceased. This hardcover volume also contains a photo scrapbook and transcription of the eulogy. La Caja also contains copies of an anecdote<strong> </strong>card that features a comic vignette which captures the spirit of the protagonist, Along side these items are illustrated wallet sized portraits, soft cover copies of the graphic novel and a 16 GB dual micro/standard USB keychain with the digital files for re-printing sharing and social media. All rights to the story belong to the patron which means it can be reprinted and sold to raise funds for the deceased's favourite cause. </p><p><strong>Why La Caja?</strong></p><p>After losing a loved one we seek a way to honour the cherished person we've lost and we seek a way to find solace<strong>. </strong>Storytelling through a comic is an excellent but practically unheard of way to do this.</p><p>The comic I created for my father brought me the solace I craved. After it was printed I slept with it in my hand and read it over and over until the emotion subsided and I was able to function again. </p><p>The comic also helped me pay tribute to him through others. It allowed me to honour him by sharing his legacy.

What's inside.My name is Janine Carrington. I'm a Canadian artist who specializes in Comics and Children's illustration. I love making comics and telling life stories.  In 2008 I started a company making personalized comics called This is Your Life Stories.  I witnessed the great joy they brought to my clients. The success I achieved with this venture combined with the passing of my father led me to decide to start making stories to honour the dead and to help the bereaved through their difficult time. The result was La Caja Comics.  La Caja is Spanish for ""The Box"" and  is pronounced ""LA KA HA"" La Caja Comics are custom made celebration of Life Comics housed in a bespoke decorative box .What's inside La CaJa?La Caja Comics is a treasure chest where you'll find items created to tell and share the story of the deceased. The contents of La Caja include a hardcover volume with a thirty page graphic novel that tells the life story of the deceased. This hardcover volume also contains a photo scrapbook and transcription of the eulogy. La Caja also contains copies of an anecdote card that features a comic vignette which captures the spirit of the protagonist, Along side these items are illustrated wallet sized portraits, soft cover copies of the graphic novel and a 16 GB dual micro/standard USB keychain with the digital files for re-printing sharing and social media. All rights to the story belong to the patron which means it can be reprinted and sold to raise funds for the deceased's favourite cause. Why La Caja?After losing a loved one we seek a way to honour the cherished person we've lost and we seek a way to find solace. Storytelling through a comic is an excellent but practically unheard of way to do this.The comic I created for my father brought me the solace I craved. After it was printed I slept with it in my hand and read it over and over until the emotion subsided and I was able to function again. The comic also helped me pay tribute to him through others. It allowed me to honour him by sharing his legacy. I created a story that accentuated his positive traits and talents. Gifting this cute story that would  be read, shared and cherished actually brought a bit of joy to one of the saddest times of my life. Joy in the real belief that every time someone read it for a few glorious minutes he came back to life again.  My hope in creating these stories is that not only the people who grieve will read them, but that they in turn will share them and remember the deceased as the years go by. With this campaign we will bring La Caja Comics into the places where grieving families go to plan their final goodbye. Families dealing with devastating grief may find great comfort in creating such a meaningful tribute.  But because the creation of a comic is such an unusual service most people don't know that such an option is available and in such a heavy time most will not be in a frame of mind to research something new.  Through this campaign we will bring La Caja comics to the trusted places where families go to say their final goodbye i.e. funeral homes, crematories, funeral directors, morticians, funeral planners. As well this campaign will help to increase La Caja Comics' visibility online in order to gently and respectfully reach out to families who do find themselves researching new options for tributes. Why will the departed by missed?  But it's more important than just us. Comics have a special power in that they are easily consumed. Everyone has a time for beautiful images and a little bit of text. And the combination of words and pictures is a great way to get a message across. We can use this power for something very good (not evil).  Because La Caja Comics are about real people and because the stories are very easily consumed La Caja comics shape the future by providing us and the generations that come after us examples of the good every member of the human race is capable of. With every positive inspirational true story that comes into existence by way of La Caja Comics the world receives the gift of the truth.I see a world with a La Caja comic in every home and on every device. A world where children are as familiar with their phenomenal ancestors story as they are with their favourite YouTube character. The more La Caja comics there are, the more positive our societies become. We will provide our descendants with documentation of the greatness of their ancestors. We give them a sense of pride in their heritage through the true story of the greatness that came before them.  A story they will enjoy reading. Which brings me to the reason for this campaign. No matter how little or much is contributed, every dollar raised by this campaign puts us one step further towards this future.Ideally I'm looking to raise $65 000 USD.

<h3>What do you mean you don't know who we are!?!</h3>
<p>We're kidding, of course! We're new to Indiegogo! So who are we &amp; who are The Secret Protectors?</p>
<p>This is a joint work between writer and creator Adam Wheeler and artist and co-creator Ben Nunn. Our story is probably a bit different to the norm. We met back in 2017 and through our joint love of all things comics, anime, manga, story and film we began working on an epic story of our own! Part of the inspiration for our story is the way, historically, comics have not always focused on fully developing Black, Asian and female characters. Don't get us wrong here, we're not trying to make any statement, we just wanted to tell an inclusive story with a diverse cast of characters that everyone can get behind. For reference, think old-school Chris Claremont X-Men.</p>
<p><strong>So, That's Us! But What About The Comic?</strong></p>
<p>Let us set the scene!</p>
<p>The year is 1982, on the surface, this Earth shares many similarities to our own. However, here, a single man's actions have altered the world forever. Unbeknownst to all but a few, humanity is in perilous danger. The Secret Protectors must put their differences aside, join forces and put an end to this looming menace.

<p><strong>So, it's a superhero comic then?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no! Our story contains science-fiction &amp; fantasy elements but also a good deal of world building and intrigue. In this series we look to delve beneath the simple themes of Good vs. Evil, examining the grey areas between them. These characters are not perfect, they are not Gods nor are they genius millionaires. They are simply people attempting to make the right call when it counts. These are human characters with flaws and complex histories that put them into conflict with each other when deciding how to act. The one thing they absolutely do know however, is that their world's fate is in their hands!</p>
<p><strong>From Adam - Writer &amp; Creator</strong></p>
<p>""I love the medium of comics; the ability to build and showcase amazing worlds and characters through not only words and narrative but also imagery has always sparked my imagination. For as long as I can remember I have had this story playing out in mind. Over the years it's developed and evolved into the basis of what would become our story - The Secret Protectors.""</p>
<p><strong>From Ben - Artist &amp; Co-Creator</strong></p>
<p>""Adam contacted me via a website sometime around mid-2017, with the idea for a comic book he was looking to develop. He thought my art style would suit the world he envisaged. Turns out Adam and I only lived like 10 minutes down the road from one another. As we discussed and debated the idea it kind of grew into this sprawling new world full with rich story-telling potential. It's a project I knew I had to be part of! Although this is our second campaign, with the completion of Volume 1 I feel like this is the culmination of this years long journey.""</p>

<p>Fans of Superheroes and fans of Sci-fi &amp; fantasy, however, with that said we haven't necessarily written this story with any particular demographic in mind.

We wanted to tell an archetypal story, something wholesome yet still entertaining and thought-provoking. Hopefully we've struck that chord and got that balance. Don't just take our word for it though, check out some of this praise we've received!</p>

Fresh Off The Back Of Our Successful Kickstarter Campaign!
Here's the opportunity for those who missed out to pick themselves up a copy of The Secret Protectors - Volume 1!

What do you mean you don't know who we are!?!
We're kidding, of course! We're new to Indiegogo! So who are we & who are The Secret Protectors?
This is a joint work between writer and creator Adam Wheeler and artist and co-creator Ben Nunn. Our story is probably a bit different to the norm. We met back in 2017 and through our joint love of all things comics, anime, manga, story and film we began working on an epic story of our own! Part of the inspiration for our story is the way, historically, comics have not always focused on fully developing Black, Asian and female characters. Don't get us wrong here, we're not trying to make any statement, we just wanted to tell an inclusive story with a diverse cast of characters that everyone can get behind. For reference, think old-school Chris Claremont X-Men.
So, That's Us! But What About The Comic?
Let us set the scene!
The year is 1982, on the surface, this Earth shares many similarities to our own. However, here, a single man's actions have altered the world forever. Unbeknownst to all but a few, humanity is in perilous danger. The Secret Protectors must put their differences aside, join forces and put an end to this looming menace. A conflict thousands of years in the making is coming to a head.
Following the loss of his father in a believed freak accident, Benjamin Banks, a twenty-year-old Kansas-native who is unaware of this secret war, finds himself imbued with incredible powers and thrust into this global conflict. Aligned with The Secret Protectors and working outside of the law for a single purpose; to stop the U.S. based clandestine organisation S.C.I.M.I.T.A.R or The Supreme Command for Incident Management & Initial Tactical Armed Response!
The pressure on both sides to succeed is unimaginable and the plot weaves between all the major players from both The Secret Protectors and The Forces of S.C.I.M.I.T.A.R

So, it's a superhero comic then?
Yes and no! Our story contains science-fiction & fantasy elements but also a good deal of world building and intrigue. In this series we look to delve beneath the simple themes of Good vs. Evil, examining the grey areas between them. These characters are not perfect, they are not Gods nor are they genius millionaires. They are simply people attempting to make the right call when it counts.

is The Barrow Hill?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Barrow Hill is an original
graphic novel following the life of a young girl and the unusual events that
surround her.</p>
<p>The story follows the fate of Erika,
her fears and dreams, her desire for happiness and her effort to find out more
about curious disappearances around her. The more she discovers, the more she
feels like the past is just repeating itself.</p>
<p>Join Erika in overcoming the
obstacles of life and experience her road to happiness and love.</p><h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432466679/mh30eo9chjpl07ipdzcm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Who
am I?</b></h2>
<p>A freelancing artist as well as a
classical archeologist. So far I have been able to (successfully, I believe)
combine my love of comics and history both in my own works and in professional
cooperation, for example in the form of educational comics.</p><h1></h1><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432467670/eyjrbldy3zair8fsbkih.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h2><b>What
is the purpose?</b></h2>
<p>The Barrow Hill has been coming out
for two years and so far a half of the story is done. The purpose of this
campaign is to collect money which will allow me to finish the story and the
art, and publish the work as a book much faster. The final story, which is also
being simultaneously released on the web, will be 216 pages long. The book
version of the story will include redone page, two new short stories and other
bonuses (see rewards).</p>
<h2><b>What
do I offer?</b></h2>
<p>An original story of 216 pages, final
print including bonus stories, totally comprising 250 pages.</p>
<p>A warm feeling of helping a project
that is worth it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432467775/xva4oxowsdkvxdutkyt3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<h2><b>What
is needed?</b></h2>
<p>Many things. Firstly, money needs to
be collected for the print and distribution of the novel. Some will go towards the
drawing and painting, so I can give The Barrow Hill more time. If I don´t need
to worry about finances, I will be able to commit myself fully to writing and
drawing. At the moment, I am only able to set aside a maximum of two days a
week, but more often than not just one.</p>
<p>Complete list of expenses:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>1300 USD – Fees and taxes
(IndieGoGo, PayPal, business tax)</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>2000 USD – Printing expenses</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>1000 USD – Shipping and
packaging fees</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>1700 USD – Money for
approximately 25 pages of art. These finances will allow me commit at least one
more day a week to making the Barrow Hill</p>
<h2><b>Why
pay for a webcomic?</b></h2>
<p>Let´s be frank, paper is paper. It
can be used for many things besides reading. I can also offer the warm feeling
of supporting someone´s dream. For those more materialistic: the paid version
will be different from the web version. It will include at least two short
comic stories. Some pages will be changed, redone, in short improved.</p>

<h3><b>Do
you have any questions? Don´t hesitate to contact us</b></h3><p></p></div>","What
is The Barrow Hill?
The Barrow Hill is an original
graphic novel following the life of a young girl and the unusual events that
surround her.
The story follows the fate of Erika,
her fears and dreams, her desire for happiness and her effort to find out more
about curious disappearances around her. The more she discovers, the more she
feels like the past is just repeating itself.
Join Erika in overcoming the
obstacles of life and experience her road to happiness and love.
Who
am I?
A freelancing artist as well as a
classical archeologist. So far I have been able to (successfully, I believe)
combine my love of comics and history both in my own works and in professional
cooperation, for example in the form of educational comics.
What
is the purpose?
The Barrow Hill has been coming out
for two years and so far a half of the story is done. The purpose of this
campaign is to collect money which will allow me to finish the story and the
art, and publish the work as a book much faster. The final story, which is also
being simultaneously released on the web, will be 216 pages long. The book
version of the story will include redone page, two new short stories and other
bonuses (see rewards).
What
do I offer?
An original story of 216 pages, final
print including bonus stories, totally comprising 250 pages.
A warm feeling of helping a project
that is worth it.
What
is needed?
Many things. Firstly, money needs to
be collected for the print and distribution of the novel. Some will go towards the
drawing and painting, so I can give The Barrow Hill more time. If I don´t need
to worry about finances, I will be able to commit myself fully to writing and
drawing. At the moment, I am only able to set aside a maximum of two days a
week, but more often than not just one.
Complete list of expenses:
- 
1300 USD – Fees and taxes
(IndieGoGo, PayPal, business tax)
- 
2000 USD – Printing expenses
- 
1000 USD – Shipping and
packaging fees
- 
1700 USD – Money for
approximately 25 pages of art. These finances will allow me commit at least one
more day a week to making the Barrow Hill
Why
pay for a webcomic?
Let´s be frank, paper is paper. It
can be used for many things besides reading. I can also offer the warm feeling
of supporting someone´s dream. For those more materialistic: the paid version
will be different from the web version. It will include at least two short
comic stories. Some pages will be changed, redone, in short improved.
And who knows, maybe I will be famous
one day and my early works will be worth their weight in gold!

<p><strong>Team-D is an adventure comic book following the adventures of Dee, a super-smart, young girl, and her grumpy, old teddy bear named Duo, and their little big adventure across the multi-dimensions of the Teddy Bear Universe to save dreams from the Monsters under the bed.</strong></p>
<p>Our story begins as Dee dreams of riding a dinosaur and chasing monsters under the bed, while her grumpy, old teddy bear, Duo, holds on tight to her, only to wake to see her teddy bear jump through a portal, and pausing only to grab her backpack, she follows... Stumbling into an adventure that will take these heroes across the dimensions to save our dreams from the Monsters under the Bed, and their leader, the nefarious Boogeyman.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Heroes</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567730917/qdizbojjfupsmi1yvgak.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Meet our heroes - Dee, our super-smart, young girl and her grumpy, old teddy bear, Duo.</p>
<h3><strong>About The Team-D Project:</strong></h3>
<p>Team-D is a comic book project that has been bubbling along in the background of the Teddy Bear Tales universe for a long time. Our hero, Dee, is based on my neighbor's super-smart kids, who it has been my honor and privilege to watch grow into amazing, young ladies. Duo, well, he is what I imagine what all old teddy bears become... A little thread worn and grumpy. </p>
<p>One thing is for sure, these two characters are going to completely shake up the Teddy Bear Tales universe and I hope you all help me start the ride.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo comic book project covers the production of the first run of this story as a comic book, and as backers you will be the first to own and read Team-D!</p>
<ul>
<li>22 pages of full color action</li>
<li>Drawn by Ace Artist Veronica Smith</li>
<li>Written by Nick Davis </li>
<li>American comic book format</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Cuddly Toy Perk:</strong></h3>
<p>Our Indiegogo features a custom teddy bear build of Duo, Dee's grumpy old teddy bear. This perk is unique to the Team-D campaign and would make an awesome addition and reading companion to the comic book.</p>

<p>Each Duo Teddy Bear is handmade to order by custom teddy bear artist, Dot of Dot's Bears. Each one is unique, with hypo-allergenic soft stuffing, safety clasp eyes/nose and hard wearing five points of articulation, for you to enact all your action poses, and of course to keep you and your loved ones safe at night from the monsters under the bed.</p>

</div></div>","Team-D is an adventure comic book following the adventures of Dee, a super-smart, young girl, and her grumpy, old teddy bear named Duo, and their little big adventure across the multi-dimensions of the Teddy Bear Universe to save dreams from the Monsters under the bed.
Our story begins as Dee dreams of riding a dinosaur and chasing monsters under the bed, while her grumpy, old teddy bear, Duo, holds on tight to her, only to wake to see her teddy bear jump through a portal, and pausing only to grab her backpack, she follows... Stumbling into an adventure that will take these heroes across the dimensions to save our dreams from the Monsters under the Bed, and their leader, the nefarious Boogeyman.
Our Heroes

Meet our heroes - Dee, our super-smart, young girl and her grumpy, old teddy bear, Duo.
About The Team-D Project:
Team-D is a comic book project that has been bubbling along in the background of the Teddy Bear Tales universe for a long time. Our hero, Dee, is based on my neighbor's super-smart kids, who it has been my honor and privilege to watch grow into amazing, young ladies. Duo, well, he is what I imagine what all old teddy bears become... A little thread worn and grumpy. 
One thing is for sure, these two characters are going to completely shake up the Teddy Bear Tales universe and I hope you all help me start the ride.
This Indiegogo comic book project covers the production of the first run of this story as a comic book, and as backers you will be the first to own and read Team-D!

22 pages of full color action
Drawn by Ace Artist Veronica Smith
Written by Nick Davis 
American comic book format

The Cuddly Toy Perk:
Our Indiegogo features a custom teddy bear build of Duo, Dee's grumpy old teddy bear. This perk is unique to the Team-D campaign and would make an awesome addition and reading companion to the comic book.

Each Duo Teddy Bear is handmade to order by custom teddy bear artist, Dot of Dot's Bears. Each one is unique, with hypo-allergenic soft stuffing, safety clasp eyes/nose and hard wearing five points of articulation, for you to enact all your action poses, and of course to keep you and your loved ones safe at night from the monsters under the bed.

Meet The Team:
This comic book project is a lean labor of love. Here is the talent rundown:

Nick Davis -  Writer and creator of Team-D and the Teddy Bear Tales universe it is set in. Also serves as production editor, letterer, tea and coffee boy, dogsbody, and Englishman.
Kat Roets - Wordy (The editor who will get all our words right.)
Veronica Smith -  The book artist of this story and the primary Team-D artist. See her work in Mr.Button, Spooky Abigail, and the Awakenings comic books.

Our Indiegogo Promise:
'This is not a padded Indiegogo project. Every cent... Every cent!!! goes to the production and printing of this comic book.'
All funding for this project will go to the art, production, and printing of this book. The Indiegogo funding goes to paying the artist and editor, printing of this comic book, and any stretch goals. Production work, layout, lettering, and formatting will be handled at no cost by Project Runner Nick Davis.
Sample Pages:
The words of the book's writer, Nick Davis, turned into English by editor Kat Roets, are brought to life by the artistic talents of Veronica Smith (Awakenings, The Long Tall Tail & Mr Button) as Team-D uncovers a world of wonder and adventure with dark dangers lurking in the shadows. Enjoy the pages below drawn by Veronica Smith: 

Stretch Goals:
Our Project Goal is set to cover the costs of producing this comic book. Anything we do past this will be a bonus and we will be ready to rock those stretch goals as we hit them. 

$1050 - All physical reward backers get a poster of the cover - Locked
$2000 - Tales From The Teddyverse - anthology comic book - Locked
$3000 - Locked

<p><strong>“Monster girls on tour”</strong> is a webcomic about the journeys and adventures of different monster girls. The protagonist, K’sara, is a salamander warrior who wants to face the strongest people in the fantasy land of Robukan, and in particular, her winged companion, Europa (whom she probably also wants to fuck). The comic has a wide cast of monster girls like lamias, centaurs, harpies, succubus, kitsunes, ants, lizards, dragons, Anubis, moths, onis, and a long etc, including some spanish creatures, and it’s full of absurd humor, geek references, ecchi, manga battles and a lot of trope breaking jokes. If you have a favourite monster, it's either in the comic, or it will be.</p>
<p>  I’ve been doing stories about Robukan for about 8 years, so you’ll find a story with a lot of setting and world building behind. “Monster girls on tour” is my second long comic on this setting, and has been running for more than 2 years already, with a physical version in Spanish (Yes i'm spanish, i make comics in between my bullfighting job and cooking tortilas). If you’re interested in reading the online material, or my other comic Guild adventure (they’re not continuation of each other and can be read independently), you can <a href=""http://kukuruyo.com/comic/0-monster-girls-on-tour-cover/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">do it in my website. </a>But if you want to find additional material and exclusive content, you may consider making a pledge for this physical version in English language.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514667750/psbdegxltpuhfmxjzwl7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you find in the physical version? </strong>(a.k.a. why the hell should i buy a physical version when the comic is online?). Well first of all is nice to have the comic on paper and support one of the few monster girl comic artists in the west, right? RIGHT?</p>
<p>But also, the physical version will include some exclusive stuff. With the comic you'll get:</p>
<p>-A total of 200 pages, containing chapters prologue, 1, 2, interlude and 3 from the online comic.</p>
<p> -18 extra pages with situations that happened during the Monster festival of the comic. These pages can usually only be read either buying the special pdf adventure “The festival” in my website, or in the physical comic.  </p>
<p>-3 extra pages for the physical version only  </p>
<p>-Several illustrations, including some nude.  </p>
<p>-Chibi “monster shaming” images</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the extras I can pledge to?  </strong></p>
<p>You can take the chance and ask for an original paper chibi drawing. This is a one in a lifetime chance because since I live in Spain, you’ll not see me at other countries conventions to ask for a drawing, so you can use the excuse of the comic shipping to have one. If you don’t take this chance you’ll regret it for the rest of your life. You, and your children, and your children’s children. For 3 months.  </p>
<p>Here’s an image of what more or less you can expect, although it will obviously be done with physical inks. You can ask me for any character of any of my comics, including Monster girls on tour, Guild adventure, GG Triggerhappy, My little Eve, Team talon blasts off again, and Silica. You can send me a note or message when paying, but I’ll contact you anyways when the crowdfunding ends.</p>

<p> You can also take the chance to pledge for one of my keychains with my drawings. I only have 10 of each design (except Astolfo, i knew that bastard would sell a lot) so i'll have to limit that pledge to 10 to avoid the chance that everyone ask for the same keychain and i run out of it. Same as before, you can send a note, or i'll contact you afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>How will the money be used?  </strong></p>
<p>The 700$ goal is the minimum quantity I have calculated to print 100 copies (around 340$), get them sent to my house, since I don’t live near any place that would print comics (around 60$), buy 100 book boxes to safely send the comic (around 85$) and still have at least a minimal benefit after indiegogo takes its part. If more than a 100 people pledge (haha, yeah, right), I’ll use that money to make a bigger printing and hope I don’t lose money in the process. <br/><br/>The end product will be like this, the spanish version, but obviously, in english.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Donald Wright is The Sire, a superhero forced by his own <i>costume</i> to fight evil.</p>
<p>When the world is thrust into chaos by an alien energy transforming normal people into crazed superhumans, The Sire has no choice but to save the day. Which makes having things like a social life or a day-job practically impossible.</p>
<p>Donald Wright is The Sire ... and he really, <i>really</i> doesn’t want to be.</p>
<p><strong>On Thursday October 17th</strong>, The Sire was featured on episode four of the hit <strong>CBS Show 'EVIL'</strong>. It featured a pin up from our most recent trade, 'Sire Volume 2: Lost in Time' by Andrew Mangum and Gene Jiminez. I've gotta tell you it was one of the coolest things to see my work featured on TV even if it was just in the background.</p>

<p>So to celebrate, I thought, why not create a new campaign featuring Andrew and Gene's work as a VARIANT cover to the original Trade it was featured in. It would also be a great way to introduce The Sire to the <strong>Indiegogo Community,</strong> something I've been wanting to do for a long time now.</p>
<p>So if you like 90's superhero action about a guy who has no control over being a superhero and praise from Newsarama, Comic Buyers Guide and more then you've come to the right place.</p>

Why Back Mizuki Saga
 

We’ll use the funds for the campaign to fund the cost of the book production and cost to make the content for the series.
We’ll update free pages to the public weekly via our main website and other respective sites.
Several exclusive pages will be bundled with Megami Saga: Resurrection and will include new and extended stories.
Our goal is to release the physical releases quarterly when we get enough support.
We’ll need your support to help this series off the ground.

Fino alla morte... Vabbe basta cambiamo storia, questa è un po’ troppo cupa… Cosa abbiamo qui? Ah sì, il mare, mi piace! Mh, peccato, c’è un po’ di nebbia, non si vede bene… Mh, sempre più nebbia… Anche troppa ... Siamo ancora in un horror, vero?<strong> </strong>La nebbia continua ad alzarsi, la chiamano la ""<strong>Lupa di Mare</strong>""… lenta ma inesorabile inghiotte tutto: i pescatori, le navi, il porto...tutta la città. La vista al suo diradarsi ti gela le vene: non c’è più nulla.</i></p>

<p><strong>L'OPERA - GRAPHIC NOVEL </strong></p>
<p>A prima vista <strong>Emma</strong> può sembrare una ragazza come tutte le altre: ha 21 anni, va all’università, ha un sogno nel cassetto, problemi in famiglia. Eppure è tormentata dagli incubi. Incubi che si fanno sempre più reali, al punto da iniziare a interferire con la sua quotidianità. Cosa significano quei sogni? Cosa rappresenta quell’ombra che continua a inseguirla?</p>
<p>Accompagna Emma alla ricerca di se stessa, in un viaggio ai confini fra sogno e realtà che la porterà a fare i conti con un passato che non comprende a pieno ma da cui non riesce a liberarsi. Dicono che i sogni nascondano qualcosa della realtà: riuscirà Emma ad accettare se stessa e l’ombra che la perseguita?</p>

<p><strong>L'OPERA - STORIA SERIALIZZATA</strong></p>
<p>Il misterioso <strong>Lusien Cain</strong> gestisce  un bar anonimo senza mai invecchiare in una Praga cupa e decadente, infestata da mostri e fantasmi. I suoi primi ricordi risalgono a 115 anni prima, dopo essersi risvegliato in una villa completamente distrutta con due soli indizi: uno strano simbolo cicatrizzato sul polso e un taglio  sulla pancia che non guarisce mai.</p>
<p>Segui Lusien nella sua ricerca di chi o cosa egli sia in un mondo folle e surreale, costantemente funestato da creature dell’incubo e dalle sue stesse inquietanti allucinazioni.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>L'OPERA - STORIA SERIALIZZATA</strong></p>
<p>Essere una bambina prodigio non è facile ed entusiasmante come ci si potrebbe aspettare, e questo <strong>Ashley </strong>lo sa bene. Soprattutto se ci si ritrova a 10 anni alle medie, sola e tormentata dai bulli. A casa la situazione non è di certo migliore, ha un rapporto terribile con i genitori. Tutta questa pressione è insopportabile per lei. Come si fa a vivere così, in piena crisi, tutta sola nella spettrale cittadina di Grimville? Morirete dalla voglia di scoprirlo.</p>
<p> </p>

<ul></ul>
</div><div>

<li><p><strong>Le barriere sono enormi</strong> - Siamo solo un gruppo di ragazzi: la passione c'è, ovviamente anche il talento &gt;:) ma mandare avanti un progetto come questo richiede tantissimo supporto. Se pensi di poterci dare una mano non esitare mai a contattarci!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Un ambiente di mostri </b>- Sì, è vero che l'industria non se la passa affatto bene da un punto di vista economico, ma ci troviamo comunque a fronteggiare dei veri e propri titani che hanno fondi infiniti a disposizione. Siamo Jundavide contro Golia. Ma non per questo ci fermeremo: sappiamo di poter competere per qualità e non siamo disposti ad arrenderci.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Logistica </b>- Il progetto è davvero complesso: ci sono duemila variabili da tenere in considerazione, dobbiamo occuparci di stampe, magazzini, spedizioni, tenere d'occhio tempistiche varie, un casino... Per fortuna abbiamo un super team in grado di tenere tutto sotto controllo!</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Ok, quale sarebbe il piano?</strong></p>
<p>Il piano è rimboccarsi le maniche, far crescere sempre di più la nostra community e dimostrare che al di là delle barriere c'è un nuovo mondo del Fumetto da creare!</p>

<p><strong>THE COMIC - ""FIABE NERE""</strong></p>
<p>Imagine... it's pitch black... you're all alone in a gloomy wood and you feel something touching your ankle. You shiver thinking of an animal but no, it’s even worse. A head! You start running, your lungs on fire, you turn around in panic to check what’s happening and... the head is still there, chasing you, rolling relentlessly. Until your death... Well, let's just change story, this is getting a bit too dark... What do we have here? Oh yes, the sea, I like it! Mh, what a pity, it's a bit misty, you can't see well... Mh, more and more mist... Way too much mist... We're still in a horror, aren't we? The mist keeps rising, they call it the ""<strong>Sea She-wolf</strong>""... slow but inexorable it swallows everything: the fishermen, the ships, the port... the whole city. The sight as it thins out freezes your wrists: there is nothing left.</p>
<p>Experience the infinite faces of fear with “Fiabe Nere”, a collection of stories that draw inspiration from popular traditions from all over the world, revisited in a horror key. </p>

<p><strong>THE COMIC - GRAPHIC NOVEL </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma</strong> may look like a normal girl at first glance : she's 21 years old, goes to university, has a secret wish, family problems. Yet, she is tormented by nightmares. Nightmares that are becoming more and more real, to the point interfering with her daily life. What do those dreams mean? What does that shadow that keeps chasing her represent?</p>
<p>Help Emma in the search for herself, on a journey on the edge between dream and reality that will force her to come to terms with a past she does not fully understand but cannot free herself from. They say that dreams hide something of reality: will Emma be able to accept herself and her shadow?</p>

<p><strong>THE COMIC - SERIALIZED STORY</strong></p>
<p>The mysterious <strong>Lusien Cain</strong> runs an anonymous bar without ever growing old in a dark and decadent Prague haunted by ghosts and monsters. His first memories go back 115 years, after waking up in a completely destroyed mansion with just two clues: a strange scarred symbol on his wrist and a gash on his belly that never heals.</p>
<p>Follow Lusien in his search for who or what he truly is in a crazy and surreal world, constantly plagued by nightmare creatures and his own disturbing hallucinations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE AUTHORS - EMANUELE SCRASCIA (Artist) + MICHELE MJ PLANTAMURA (Writer)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emanuele Scrascia </strong></p>
<p>Born in Termoli, he's a cartoonist and illustrator. He attends the International School of Comics when he's not drunk. SYZYGY was born from his first idea of Lusien Cain, a character he created several years ago and that he never wanted to give up on.</p>
<p><strong>Michele “MJ” Plantamura </strong></p>
<p>An hungry devourer of books and comics, he writes and draws, getting inspiration from his great love for travels and adventures. SYZYGY is his first publication, in which he writes the script and dialogues and colours the illustrations.</p>

<p><strong>THE COMIC - A SERIALIZED STORY</strong></p>
<p>Being a wunderkind is not as easy and exciting as one might expect, and <strong>Ashley</strong> knows this pretty well. She’s 10 years old, in middle school, alone and tormented by bullies. The situation at home is certainly not better, her relationship with her parents is terrible. All this pressure is unbearable. How can she live like this, in the middle of a crisis, all alone in the spectral town of Grimville? You must be dying to find out. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE AUTHORS - MERCY SARA (Artist) + MICHELE MJ PLANTAMURA (Writer)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mercy Sara</strong></p>
<p>Born in 1996 in the Salerno, Sara lives half of her life in a remote and godforsaken village in the Alburni mountains. She's been passionate about art, comics and videogames since she was a kid. In 2013 she moved to Naples and divided her time between high school and the Italian School of Comics. In 2016 she discovered her love for illustration and digital painting, studying at the ""Genius Academy"" in Rome. In the meantime, trying to finish university, because is obviously better to do a lot of things badly than doing one well :)</p>
<p><strong>Michele MJ Plantamura</strong></p>
<p>See above. We know, it's everywhere. After SYZYGY he's also working on Ashley is Still Alive. Unstoppable.</p>

If one of those damn monsters attacks you and rips your arm away? THEY'LL KICK MY ASS! We're not even insured..."" </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, we are not living in a dream. We are well aware a project like ours is very ambitious and that ahead of us there’s a road full of obstacles. But we are confident that, with your support, we can do it!</p>
<p>Jundo bases its strength on its community: creating a community with a common vision on the comic-world will be the key to our success! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Here the main challenges we will face:</p>
<ul><li> <strong>Enormous Barriers</strong> - We are just a group of young people: we have passion, of course we have talent &gt;:) but running a project like this requires a lot of support. If you think you can help us, don't hesitate to contact us!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>A world full of Monsters</strong> - Yeah, it's true that the comic industry is not doing that well from an economic point of view, but we are still facing real titans, with infinite funds at their disposal. It's Jundavid versus Goliath. But that won’t stop us: we know we can compete for quality and we're not willing to give up.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Logistics </strong>- The project is really complex: there are two thousand variables to take into account; we have to deal with printing, stocking, shipping, keeping an eye on various timescales, it’s a huge mess... Luckily, we have a super team that can keep everything under control! </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 align=""center"">Yeah, but why are you doing it if it's so hard?</h3>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Because it is necessary!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Ok, what’s the plan?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">The plan is to get busy, make our community grow more and more and show that beyond the barriers there is a new comics-world to create!</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Who’s behind Jundo?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Jundo community is made up of you, our growing number of comics and manga Artists and our Team. In the meantime we’ll spoil you who we are but in the next months we’ll get to know each other more and more! </p>

“Ehi tu! Perchè invece di startene lì impalato al freddo non prendi un piccone e inizi a scavare? Forza! Pensi che queste barriere si butteranno giù da sole? COSA? Che vuol dire che non sai nemmeno come sei arrivato qui? Ah... odio fare il training alle reclute.”
 

 
Noi siamo Jundo, la nuova onda del fumetto nata per supportare i giovani artisti! In questo mondo ci sono un sacco di ragazze e ragazzi pieni di talento, ma superare le barriere del mercato del fumetto è veramente difficile. Sì certo, uno ogni tanto ce la fa e passa dall'altro lato, ma bisogna pensare in grande: LA BARRIERA VA DISTRUTTA!
 
“Come quale barriera? COSA TI SEMBRA QUESTA ROBA ENORME QUA DIETRO? Apri bene le orecchie: qua fuori per questi ragazzi è un inferno! Nessuno ti pubblica, stipendi da fame, l'auto-produzione è un casino. Ma ti sei guardato intorno? Aspe' ma hai almeno letto il volantino? CHE VUOL DIRE QUALE VOLANTINO? Lo sapevo, dovevo restarmene a casa. Dai su, leggi qua!""
 

 
“EHI! QUA FUORI SI GELA, NON ABBIAMO MICA TUTTO IL GIORN- ah, hai finito? Bene, allora seguimi. Ti porto dalla PRIMA SQUADRA ANTI BARRIERE!”
 
LA PRIMA SQUADRA
 
“Ehi voi, tutti al lavoro! Vi ho portato una nuova recluta! CHE VUOL DIRE CHE FUORI FA TROPPO FREDDO? Che figura ci fate con i nuovi... Prendete il cappotto e andate a scavare! E TU METTI GIÙ QUELLA TESTA!”
 

 
Lo scopo di questa campagna non è solo promuovere la piattaforma: il nostro obiettivo primario è portare attenzione sulle nostre opere e sui nostri artisti!
Ecco i primi 5 fumetti Jundo, che potrai pre-acquistare, in edizione limitata, tramite questa campagna. Comprando una di queste opere andrai a supportare direttamente l'artista, dandogli modo di concentrarsi a tempo pieno sul suo lavoro (e non sulle bollette).
 
ARS Nona: Carnival Chaos
 

 
L'OPERA - SPIN-OFF/STAND ALONE
Uuuh che figata, una storia sulle maschere di carnevale! Ci sono proprio tutti! Arlecchino, Pulcinella, Pantalone, Burlamacco, Acros, Romeo... Saru…  ehi aspetta, e questi mo' chi sono? MA CHE SUCCEDE?
Immergiti nel festoso e colorato mondo di Lucky Town insieme ad Acros, Romeo e Saru. Ma stai attento, non è tutto carnevale quello che luccica: una cupa realtà si annida dietro le quinte. Cosa si nasconde dietro quelle ridenti maschere?
 
L'AUTORE - ACROS
Creatore e creatura a volte sono la stessa cosa. Acros nasce come nome d’arte ma prende vita come avatar, per poi diventare il personaggio che ha in pugno la vita stessa del creatore. Non è ancora chiaro chi abbia disegnato per primo l’altro.
Membro e cofondatore del collettivo ""ARS Nona"" insieme ad Andrea Milana e Gabriele Mareri, insieme creano la serie omonima ARS Nona, di cui Carnival Chaos è uno spin-off.

Fiabe Nere
 

 
L'OPERA - RACCOLTA DI RACCONTI
Immagina… è buio pesto... sei da solo in un bosco tetro e senti qualcosa che ti tocca la caviglia. Rabbrividisci pensando a un animale ma no, pure peggio. Una testa! Inizi a correre, i polmoni ti vanno a fuoco, ti giri in preda al panico per controllare e... la testa è ancora lì, che ti insegue rotolando inesorabile. Fino alla morte... Vabbe basta cambiamo storia, questa è un po’ troppo cupa… Cosa abbiamo qui? Ah sì, il mare, mi piace! Mh, peccato, c’è un po’ di nebbia, non si vede bene… Mh, sempre più nebbia… Anche troppa ... Siamo ancora in un horror, vero? La nebbia continua ad alzarsi, la chiamano la ""Lupa di Mare""… lenta ma inesorabile inghiotte tutto: i pescatori, le navi, il porto...tutta la città. La vista al suo diradarsi ti gela le vene: non c’è più nulla.
Scopri gli infiniti volti della paura con i racconti delle Fiabe Nere, una raccolta che trae ispirazione dalle tradizioni popolari di tutto il mondo rivisitate in chiave horror. 
 
L'AUTORE - ANDREA MILANA

L'OPERA - GRAPHIC NOVEL 
A prima vista Emma può sembrare una ragazza come tutte le altre: ha 21 anni, va all’università, ha un sogno nel cassetto, problemi in famiglia. Eppure è tormentata dagli incubi. Incubi che si fanno sempre più reali, al punto da iniziare a interferire con la sua quotidianità. Cosa significano quei sogni? Cosa rappresenta quell’ombra che continua a inseguirla?
Accompagna Emma alla ricerca di se stessa, in un viaggio ai confini fra sogno e realtà che la porterà a fare i conti con un passato che non comprende a pieno ma da cui non riesce a liberarsi. Dicono che i sogni nascondano qualcosa della realtà: riuscirà Emma ad accettare se stessa e l’ombra che la perseguita?

SYZYGY
 

 
L'OPERA - STORIA SERIALIZZATA
Il misterioso Lusien Cain gestisce  un bar anonimo senza mai invecchiare in una Praga cupa e decadente, infestata da mostri e fantasmi. I suoi primi ricordi risalgono a 115 anni prima, dopo essersi risvegliato in una villa completamente distrutta con due soli indizi: uno strano simbolo cicatrizzato sul polso e un taglio  sulla pancia che non guarisce mai.
Segui Lusien nella sua ricerca di chi o cosa egli sia in un mondo folle e surreale, costantemente funestato da creature dell’incubo e dalle sue stesse inquietanti allucinazioni.

Ashley is Still Alive
 

 
L'OPERA - STORIA SERIALIZZATA
Essere una bambina prodigio non è facile ed entusiasmante come ci si potrebbe aspettare, e questo Ashley lo sa bene. Soprattutto se ci si ritrova a 10 anni alle medie, sola e tormentata dai bulli. A casa la situazione non è di certo migliore, ha un rapporto terribile con i genitori. Tutta questa pressione è insopportabile per lei. Come si fa a vivere così, in piena crisi, tutta sola nella spettrale cittadina di Grimville? Morirete dalla voglia di scoprirlo.
 
GLI AUTORI - MERCY SARA (Disegni) + MICHELE MJ PLANTAMURA (Sceneggiatura)
Mercy Sara
Nasce nel '96 nel Salernitano. Vive metà della sua vita in un paesino sperduto e dimenticato da Dio sui monti Alburni e fin da piccola si appassiona all'arte, ai fumetti e ai videogiochi. Nel 2013 si trasferisce a Napoli e si divide tra liceo classico e Scuola Italiana di Comix, mentre nel 2016 scopre il suo amore per l'illustrazione e la pittura digitale studiando alla genius Academy di Roma. Tutto questo, nel frattempo, cercando di finire l'università, perchè ovviamente meglio fare tante cose fatte male che una sola fatta bene :)
Michele MJ Plantamura
Vedi sopra. Lo sappiamo, è ovunque. Dopo il suo lavoro su SYZYGY si è lanciato anche all'avventura con Ashley is Still Alive. Inarrestabile.

LA NOSTRA APP - JUNDO
 
“...quello scheletro non lo sopporto proprio, sempre a fare danni! No, no, non la Morte, lei è una tipa apposto. Parlavo di quello vestito da marinaretto. Vabbè, comunque, ora che ti ho spiegato tutto è tempo di iniziare a lavor- CHE VUOL DIRE CHE NON HAI ANCORA CAPITO COSA FACCIAMO QUI? E pensare che iniziavi a essermi simpatico...”
 
Jundo è una piattaforma web/app (iOS/Android) per leggere fumetti online.
No, non abbiamo le scan di Onepiece; pubblichiamo opere originali disegnate da artisti giovani e fortissimi. Non pubblichiamo però tutto quello che ci arriva: prima di poter caricare un'opera su Jundo passa un lungo periodo di valutazione in cui ci confrontiamo con l'artista per affinarla al massimo!
Sì, sì, vabbe, arriva al punto. Come funziona? Per spiegarvelo abbiamo preparato delle card!
 

 
 
I NOSTRI REWARD

IL NOSTRO OBIETTIVO
 
""Allora, bella la roba in magazzino, ve'? Ma ora le cose importanti: ti ho già detto della barriera, ora va buttata giù! Seguimi nella tenda di controllo... i nostri ricercatori Jundo hanno già un piano!""

 

 

RISCHI E SFIDE
 
""Ehi, ehi frena, dove credi di andare senza casco? Lo sai che succede se entri là dentro, ti cade un ghiacciolo in testa e ci resti scemo? Se uno di quei maledetti mostri ti attacca e ti porta via un braccio? QUELLI MI FANNO IL CULO! Non siamo nemmeno assicurati...""

 
Ovviamente non viviamo in un sogno. Sappiamo bene che un'iniziativa di questo tipo è molto ambiziosa e che la strada davanti a noi è piena di ostacoli. Ma siamo convinti che con il vostro supporto potremo farcela!
Jundo è un progetto che basa la sua forza sulla community: creare una community con una visione comune sul mondo del fumetto sarà la chiave per il nostro successo!
 

 
Ecco le sfide principali che ci troveremo ad affrontare: 



Le barriere sono enormi - Siamo solo un gruppo di ragazzi: la passione c'è, ovviamente anche il talento >:) ma mandare avanti un progetto come questo richiede tantissimo supporto. Se pensi di poterci dare una mano non esitare mai a contattarci!
Un ambiente di mostri - Sì, è vero che l'industria non se la passa affatto bene da un punto di vista economico, ma ci troviamo comunque a fronteggiare dei veri e propri titani che hanno fondi infiniti a disposizione. Siamo Jundavide contro Golia. Ma non per questo ci fermeremo: sappiamo di poter competere per qualità e non siamo disposti ad arrenderci.
Logistica - Il progetto è davvero complesso: ci sono duemila variabili da tenere in considerazione, dobbiamo occuparci di stampe, magazzini, spedizioni, tenere d'occhio tempistiche varie, un casino... Per fortuna abbiamo un super team in grado di tenere tutto sotto controllo!

 
Ok, quale sarebbe il piano?
Il piano è rimboccarsi le maniche, far crescere sempre di più la nostra community e dimostrare che al di là delle barriere c'è un nuovo mondo del Fumetto da creare!
Chi c'è dietro Jundo, I POTERI FORTI?!
La community Jundo è composta da voi, dai nostri Artisti in continuo aumento e dal nostro Team. Vi spoileriamo intanto chi siamo; nei prossimi mesi ci conosceremo sempre di più!

JUNDO, LET'S DESTROY THE COMIC-WORLD BARRIERS! 
 
""Hey you! Why don't you get a pickaxe and start digging instead of standing out there in the snow? Come on! Do you think these barriers are going to break down by themselves? WHAT? What do you mean you don't even know how you got here? Ah... I hate training recruits.""
 


We are Jundo, the new comics wave born to support young artists! There are a lot of talented girls and boys in this world, but overcoming the barriers of the comics market is really hard. Yes of course, every now and then someone manages to go on the other side, but we must dream big: THE BARRIER MUST BE DESTROYED! 
 
""Which barrier? WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS HUGE THING IS? Listen carefully: it's hell out here for these guys! Nobody's publishing you, wages are super low, self-publishing is a mess. Have you looked around? Wait, did you read the flyer atleast? WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT FLYER? I knew it, I should’ve stayed home. Come on, read this!"" 
 

 
""HEY! I'M FREEZING HERE, I HAVEN’T GOT ALL DAY! Oh, you’ve already done? Well then, follow me. I'm bringing you to meet the FIRST ANTI-BARRIER PLATOON!"" 
 
THE FIRST PLATOON
 
""Hey everybody, back to work! Here’s a new recruit! WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S TOO COLD OUTSIDE? We’ll look like fools... Come on, get your coats and go digging! AND YOU - PUT THAT HEAD DOWN!"" 
 

 
The mission of this campaign is not just to promote our platform: our primary goal is to put our comics and our artists under the spotlight!
Here are the first 5 Jundo comics, available for pre-purchase, in limited edition! By buying one of these comics you will directly support the artist, giving him/her the opportunity to focus full time on his/her job (and not the bills).
 
ARS Nona: Carnival Chaos
(Available in English!)
 

 
THE COMIC - SPIN-OFF/STAND ALONE
Oooh how cool, a story about carnival masks! Everybody's here! Harlequin, Pulcinella, Pantalone, Burlamacco, Acros, Romeo... Saru... hey wait a second, who are these guys? WHAT'S GOING ON?
Dive in the happy and colourful world of Lucky Town together with Acros, Romeo and Saru. But be careful, not all that glitters is Carnival: a dark reality lurks behind the scenes. What’s hiding behind those laughing masks?
 
THE AUTHOR - ACROS
Sometimes creator and creature are the same thing. Acros was born as a stage name but came to life as an avatar, only to become the character who holds the creator's life in his hands. It is not yet clear who drew the other first.
Member and co-founder of the ""ARS Nona"" collective, together with Andrea Milana and Gabriele Mareri, they created the ARS Nona series, of which Carnival Chaos is a spin-off.

THE COMIC - ""FIABE NERE""
Imagine... it's pitch black... you're all alone in a gloomy wood and you feel something touching your ankle. You shiver thinking of an animal but no, it’s even worse. A head! You start running, your lungs on fire, you turn around in panic to check what’s happening and... the head is still there, chasing you, rolling relentlessly. Until your death... Well, let's just change story, this is getting a bit too dark... What do we have here? Oh yes, the sea, I like it! Mh, what a pity, it's a bit misty, you can't see well... Mh, more and more mist... Way too much mist... We're still in a horror, aren't we? The mist keeps rising, they call it the ""Sea She-wolf""... slow but inexorable it swallows everything: the fishermen, the ships, the port... the whole city. The sight as it thins out freezes your wrists: there is nothing left.
Experience the infinite faces of fear with “Fiabe Nere”, a collection of stories that draw inspiration from popular traditions from all over the world, revisited in a horror key. 
 
THE AUTHOR - ANDREA MILANA

(Available in English!)
 

 
THE COMIC - GRAPHIC NOVEL 
Emma may look like a normal girl at first glance : she's 21 years old, goes to university, has a secret wish, family problems. Yet, she is tormented by nightmares. Nightmares that are becoming more and more real, to the point interfering with her daily life. What do those dreams mean? What does that shadow that keeps chasing her represent?
Help Emma in the search for herself, on a journey on the edge between dream and reality that will force her to come to terms with a past she does not fully understand but cannot free herself from. They say that dreams hide something of reality: will Emma be able to accept herself and her shadow?

THE COMIC - A SERIALIZED STORY
Being a wunderkind is not as easy and exciting as one might expect, and Ashley knows this pretty well. She’s 10 years old, in middle school, alone and tormented by bullies. The situation at home is certainly not better, her relationship with her parents is terrible. All this pressure is unbearable. How can she live like this, in the middle of a crisis, all alone in the spectral town of Grimville? You must be dying to find out.

Jundo is a web/app platform (iOS/Android) where you’ll be able to read comics.
No, we don't have Onepiece scans; we publish original comics created by young and talented artists. We don't publish everything we are offered though: before uploading a comic on Jundo we spend a lot of time evaluating it and talking with the artist to refine it to the maximum!
Yeah, sure, whatever, get to the point. How does it work? We’ve prepared some cards to explain it to you!

OUR GOAL
 
""So, the stuff in the warehouse is cool, huh? But! The important things now: I've already told you about the barrier, now it has to be knocked down! Follow me to the control tent... our Jundo researchers already have a plan!""
 


 
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
 
""Hey, hey hold on, where do you think you're going without a helmet? Do you know what’ll happen if you go in there, an icicle hits you on the head and you become stupid? If one of those damn monsters attacks you and rips your arm away? THEY'LL KICK MY ASS! We're not even insured..."" 
 
Obviously, we are not living in a dream. We are well aware a project like ours is very ambitious and that ahead of us there’s a road full of obstacles. But we are confident that, with your support, we can do it!
Jundo bases its strength on its community: creating a community with a common vision on the comic-world will be the key to our success! 
 

 
Here the main challenges we will face:
 Enormous Barriers - We are just a group of young people: we have passion, of course we have talent >:) but running a project like this requires a lot of support. If you think you can help us, don't hesitate to contact us!
 

A world full of Monsters - Yeah, it's true that the comic industry is not doing that well from an economic point of view, but we are still facing real titans, with infinite funds at their disposal. It's Jundavid versus Goliath. But that won’t stop us: we know we can compete for quality and we're not willing to give up.
 

Logistics - The project is really complex: there are two thousand variables to take into account; we have to deal with printing, stocking, shipping, keeping an eye on various timescales, it’s a huge mess... Luckily, we have a super team that can keep everything under control! 
 
Yeah, but why are you doing it if it's so hard?
Because it is necessary!
 
Ok, what’s the plan?
 
The plan is to get busy, make our community grow more and more and show that beyond the barriers there is a new comics-world to create!
 
Who’s behind Jundo?
 
The Jundo community is made up of you, our growing number of comics and manga Artists and our Team. In the meantime we’ll spoil you who we are but in the next months we’ll get to know each other more and more!

We will be serious for 2 seconds: thank you for reading so far and THANK YOU if you’ll support us however you can! We are trying really hard with this project and we want to thank you for believing in us <3

Is your daily unsatisfied soul urging, no, pleading, strike that! Dripping with a yearning for a hard and musky deep dose of the 80s and 90s nostalgia? If presented with vulgar imagery of pre-post-apocalyptic and post-post-apocalyptic disporia would your body tense up with tingles that inch from your hypothalamus down to your naughty bits? Does the thought of fight scenes laced with almost pornographic rage and lustful hero power moves make your inner being erect? Do your legs quiver for a bad touch of robots, death races, lesbian bounty hunters with big ass fucking guns looking to decapitate a mother fucker for a small payout? Do you have an affection for metal, heavy metal, grit, and dirt? What about a psychopathic coo-coo half-robot, half-human sexually disturbed villain that is hellbent on slaughtering the universe while carrying a stillborn baby within their translucent breadbasket? Don’t you dare tell me this isn’t enough for your body to turn on its secretion factory! Oh, it isn’t? You sadistic fuck, I like you! Well, do your animalistic compulsions make demands for sexy hot heroes with sexual tension so thick and husky it’ll make your past relationships look like flaccid Thanksgiving turkeys grinding into each other relentlessly while in oncoming traffic? Then trust me when I said that we are about to leave your undergarments humid with excitement with our story of Airith. A badass former childhood pop star slash sex assassin who goes on betraying her mother with one mission and one mission alone, to kill the bitch. Oh let’s not forget about the absolutely large fucking swords.</p><p>But Airith is more than just an action-packed orgy of hazardous adventures, it is also an educational and multi-cultural experience. Have you ever wanted to learn expressive bi-lingual phrases? Some amazing and exotic specimens of this carnal vocabulary that your ears will be tantalized with are;</p><p><i>'Que te folle un pez'</i></p><p><i>'Me cago en todo lo que se menea!'</i></p><p><i>'Te voy a romper la cara a trompadas'</i></p><p><i>'Guacamole cum tits'</i></p><p><i>'Me cago en la leche!'</i></p><p>If that alone doesn’t make your fingers throb for a page-turning comic, I can only criticize your mother for not raising you right! I bet she raised you not to drop four tabs of acid given to you by a homeless scoundrel from the bad part of downtown. Then before that shit dropkicks its peak take a lethargic longspun labyrinth stride into the desert and converse with the time architects about how the fundamental constituents of the universe are one-dimensional “strings” rather than point-like particles and require six or seven extra dimensions of space, and it contains ways of relating large extra dimensions to small ones, only to find out you’ve been dry humping a cactus for 16 hours straight. If you didn’t then not only is this project NOT for you, you also just proved to us you’re a poon and you will not be allowed to sit at our table during lunchtime today. Make sure Karen from accounting knows of this as well.</p><p>But back to this prodigious and unbelievable pitch. Actually, I’m tired of writing so I will hastily summarize Airith for you.</p><p>Hot women. Hot dudes. Hot battles. Hot villains. Hot sexual tension.

Bryan has managed to create a world that is both shockingly new and yet has the familiar sensation of a fun acid flashback. This is a show I would happily binge.”
- Simon Oré, President, Starburns Industries PressLet’s be realistic, the bulk of entertainment content in our world today is essentially that petite piece of watered-down murky turd in the toilet that just won’t flush. No matter how many times you try to sink that dinky fucker down that porcelain tunnel banishing it to the sewers along with the other filth, that bastard’s fortitude to counter spin is unwinnable, you must admit defeat and hope the next sap can piss it into more dainty pieces or drop a douce that forms to it, dragging it down along with it. That my compatriots are the moist poo pellets of content you are shoving down your pre-shit hole, flustering your stomach with disappointment.But don’t fret mi gente, we have a solution for your desensitized pleasure towards high-quality mother fucking badassness!May I ask a few simple questions? Is your daily unsatisfied soul urging, no, pleading, strike that! Dripping with a yearning for a hard and musky deep dose of the 80s and 90s nostalgia? If presented with vulgar imagery of pre-post-apocalyptic and post-post-apocalyptic disporia would your body tense up with tingles that inch from your hypothalamus down to your naughty bits? Does the thought of fight scenes laced with almost pornographic rage and lustful hero power moves make your inner being erect? Do your legs quiver for a bad touch of robots, death races, lesbian bounty hunters with big ass fucking guns looking to decapitate a mother fucker for a small payout? Do you have an affection for metal, heavy metal, grit, and dirt? What about a psychopathic coo-coo half-robot, half-human sexually disturbed villain that is hellbent on slaughtering the universe while carrying a stillborn baby within their translucent breadbasket? Don’t you dare tell me this isn’t enough for your body to turn on its secretion factory! Oh, it isn’t? You sadistic fuck, I like you! Well, do your animalistic compulsions make demands for sexy hot heroes with sexual tension so thick and husky it’ll make your past relationships look like flaccid Thanksgiving turkeys grinding into each other relentlessly while in oncoming traffic? Then trust me when I said that we are about to leave your undergarments humid with excitement with our story of Airith. A badass former childhood pop star slash sex assassin who goes on betraying her mother with one mission and one mission alone, to kill the bitch. Oh let’s not forget about the absolutely large fucking swords.But Airith is more than just an action-packed orgy of hazardous adventures, it is also an educational and multi-cultural experience. Have you ever wanted to learn expressive bi-lingual phrases? Some amazing and exotic specimens of this carnal vocabulary that your ears will be tantalized with are;'Que te folle un pez''Me cago en todo lo que se menea!''Te voy a romper la cara a trompadas''Guacamole cum tits''Me cago en la leche!'If that alone doesn’t make your fingers throb for a page-turning comic, I can only criticize your mother for not raising you right! I bet she raised you not to drop four tabs of acid given to you by a homeless scoundrel from the bad part of downtown. Then before that shit dropkicks its peak take a lethargic longspun labyrinth stride into the desert and converse with the time architects about how the fundamental constituents of the universe are one-dimensional “strings” rather than point-like particles and require six or seven extra dimensions of space, and it contains ways of relating large extra dimensions to small ones, only to find out you’ve been dry humping a cactus for 16 hours straight. If you didn’t then not only is this project NOT for you, you also just proved to us you’re a poon and you will not be allowed to sit at our table during lunchtime today. Make sure Karen from accounting knows of this as well.But back to this prodigious and unbelievable pitch. Actually, I’m tired of writing so I will hastily summarize Airith for you.Hot women. Hot dudes. Hot battles. Hot villains. Hot sexual tension. A hot musical soundtrack that comes with each comic issue. Hot hotness and hotter than hot nostalgia. Maybe even some hot creators behind the project, but you’ll just have to see for yourselves, but that will require a contract offer.With bought love and sloppy kissesP.S. Let’s quit making pieces of shit that won’t flush.<TL;DR>If you like 80s nostalgia mixed with some post-apocalyptic mayhem, twisted with pure awesomeness laced with some lasers, lesbian bounty hunters, murderous robotic mothers, Spanish, rock stars, space operas, dance moves, and amazing artwork, you've come to the right place!</TL:DR>Sneak PeekCheck out the first 8 pages of our 28-page first issue.

<h3>Rövid összefoglaló / Short summary</h3>
<p> Gyáni Levente vagyok és készülő dolgozatommal megpróbálom megalapozni az Ereklyék Ligája sorozatot. Bárki, aki úgy érzi csatlakozhat a ligához egy saját történettel, újabb feltámadt ereklyékkel. Az alapötlet szerint az ereklyék különféle kalandokba keveredve spirituális erejükkel segítik az emberi fajt visszatérni a létezés egyetemes értékeihez, hogy ezzel megakadályozzák bolygónk kipusztulását. Ahogy a kezdő videóban látható, A Szent Jobb az, aki interspirituális körülmények között elsőként életre kel, majd egyből nyoma is vész, és a bonyodalmak persze itt még nem érnek véget.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p> My name is Levente Gyáni and my comic will be the first chapter of The League of Relics series. Anybody can take part in the series, who create a story wich hangs together with the idea of the first chapter. It means that the relics help the human race return to universal values, to stop the extinction of our planet. As it can be seen in the starter video the Holy right is the first waked relic, who disappeared immediately, but the complications are not over yet.</p>

<h3>Céljaink és amit kínálunk/What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> Fő célkitűzésünk, hogy képregényünk a lehető legtöbb emberhez eljusson, kiegészülve a különféle csomagokban elérhető kiegészítőkkel, a lehető legjobb minőségben kivitelezve. Ez azt jelenti, hogy a célösszeg elérésétől függetlenül a projektet megvalósítjuk. A célösszeg elérésén túl viszont 1000 dolláronként újabb és újabb nyelvekre fordítjuk le a történetet aszerint, hogy a Coffeetime csomagban leadott szavazatok szerint melyik nyelv áll az élen. És most lássuk, hogy mit kínálunk a képregényen kívűl : plakátot, pólókat és kézzel öntött Szent Jobb kulcstartót ! </p>

<p> I need five months to finish the first 50 pages chapter in hungarian and in english languages. The first goal is for preparing the comic, posters, t-shirts, hand-crafted keyholders at the proper time. If we will not reach the first goal, don""t panic ! The project will be done ! But if we reach the first goal , the next goals is for translate the story to other languages voted in the coffeetime package. It means when we reach the next 1000 dollars we will translate the story to the next language.</p>

</div></div>","Rövid összefoglaló / Short summary
 Gyáni Levente vagyok és készülő dolgozatommal megpróbálom megalapozni az Ereklyék Ligája sorozatot. Bárki, aki úgy érzi csatlakozhat a ligához egy saját történettel, újabb feltámadt ereklyékkel. Az alapötlet szerint az ereklyék különféle kalandokba keveredve spirituális erejükkel segítik az emberi fajt visszatérni a létezés egyetemes értékeihez, hogy ezzel megakadályozzák bolygónk kipusztulását. Ahogy a kezdő videóban látható, A Szent Jobb az, aki interspirituális körülmények között elsőként életre kel, majd egyből nyoma is vész, és a bonyodalmak persze itt még nem érnek véget.

Hi!
 My name is Levente Gyáni and my comic will be the first chapter of The League of Relics series. Anybody can take part in the series, who create a story wich hangs together with the idea of the first chapter. It means that the relics help the human race return to universal values, to stop the extinction of our planet. As it can be seen in the starter video the Holy right is the first waked relic, who disappeared immediately, but the complications are not over yet.
 
  
 

Céljaink és amit kínálunk/What We Need & What You Get
 Fő célkitűzésünk, hogy képregényünk a lehető legtöbb emberhez eljusson, kiegészülve a különféle csomagokban elérhető kiegészítőkkel, a lehető legjobb minőségben kivitelezve. Ez azt jelenti, hogy a célösszeg elérésétől függetlenül a projektet megvalósítjuk. A célösszeg elérésén túl viszont 1000 dolláronként újabb és újabb nyelvekre fordítjuk le a történetet aszerint, hogy a Coffeetime csomagban leadott szavazatok szerint melyik nyelv áll az élen. És most lássuk, hogy mit kínálunk a képregényen kívűl : plakátot, pólókat és kézzel öntött Szent Jobb kulcstartót ! 

 I need five months to finish the first 50 pages chapter in hungarian and in english languages. The first goal is for preparing the comic, posters, t-shirts, hand-crafted keyholders at the proper time. If we will not reach the first goal, don""t panic ! The project will be done ! But if we reach the first goal , the next goals is for translate the story to other languages voted in the coffeetime package. It means when we reach the next 1000 dollars we will translate the story to the next language.

Köszönjük! / Thank you !
 Köszönünk minden támogatást, megosztást és hogy végigböngészed terveinket, reméljük találsz benne számodra értékes dolgokat, gondolatokat !

<li>
<strong>L’ispirazione</strong>: noi donne siamo abituate a non proseguire i propri sogni. Noi vogliamo parlare di donne che, nonostante le mille difficoltà, sono andate dritte per la loro strada e hanno realizzato il loro sogno: <strong>diventare artiste</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>La memoria.</strong> Solo da pochi anni si stanno riscoprendo artiste che, nella loro epoca, erano assolutamente conosciute e apprezzate (vedi Sofonisba Anguissola, Lavinia Fontana, Elisabetta Sirani). Parlare di loro e del loro lavoro non solo<strong> restituisce dignità al ruolo della donna nella Storia dell’Arte ma anche alle artiste che vorranno percorrere la loro strada.</strong>
</li>
<li>Il terzo motivo è dedicato a chi è appassionato di <strong>fumetto e illustrazione</strong>: abbiamo coinvolto <strong>27 illustratrici e fumettiste piene di talento</strong> che sicuramente realizzeranno un lavoro magnifico!</li>

Sono donne sognatrici, tenaci, eroiche. Artiste è un libro disegnato da 27 illustratrici e fumettiste che racconta le vite e le opere delle donne nella storia dell'arte3 Motivi per sostenere il nostro progetto

L’ispirazione: noi donne siamo abituate a non proseguire i propri sogni. Noi vogliamo parlare di donne che, nonostante le mille difficoltà, sono andate dritte per la loro strada e hanno realizzato il loro sogno: diventare artiste.

La memoria. Solo da pochi anni si stanno riscoprendo artiste che, nella loro epoca, erano assolutamente conosciute e apprezzate (vedi Sofonisba Anguissola, Lavinia Fontana, Elisabetta Sirani). Parlare di loro e del loro lavoro non solo restituisce dignità al ruolo della donna nella Storia dell’Arte ma anche alle artiste che vorranno percorrere la loro strada.

Il terzo motivo è dedicato a chi è appassionato di fumetto e illustrazione: abbiamo coinvolto 27 illustratrici e fumettiste piene di talento che sicuramente realizzeranno un lavoro magnifico!
 [ENG]The Women Artists are unconventional, rebellious, often stubborn and always inspired. They are dreamers, tenacious, heroic.Artiste is a book drawn by 27 illustrators and cartoonists about the lives and works of women in Art History3 Reasons to support our project

The inspiration: women are not accustomed to pursue their dreams. We want to talk about women who, despite the many difficulties, went straight on their way, and have realized their dream of becoming artists.


The memory. Only a few years they are rediscovering artists who, in their time, were absolutely known and appreciated (Sofonisba Anguissola, Lavinia Fontana, Elisabetta Sirani). Talk about them and their work not only restores dignity to the role of women in art history but also to artists who want to go their way.
The third reason is for those who is passionate about comics and illustration: we involved 27 talented illustrators and cartoonist that will definitely make a magnificent work!
  Quando parliamo delle artiste la figura che ci viene in mente è Frida Kahlo, diventata icona del femminismo e dell'arte al femminile, dimenticando chi l'ha preceduta. Questa autoproduzione non vuole essere un catalogo di storia dell'arte ma un libro per far conoscere le opere delle artiste nel corso dei secoli attraverso il ritratto personale delle illustratrici e fumettiste. Le biografie saranno realizzate da autrici italiane con stili e linguaggi diversi tra loro Il libro racconta le vite di artiste realmente vissute dall'era preistorica fino a metà del 1800 come Claricia, Artemisia Gentileschi, Lavinia Fontana, Sofonisba Anguissola, Judith Leyster e Camille Claudel.Artiste è un libro di 100+ pagine con fumetti e illustrazioni di:[ENG]When we talk about women artists, we usually think about Frida Kahlo -who became an icon of feminism and women in art- and we tend to forget about those who preceeded her.This self production doesn't  want to be a catalogue of art history, but a book to know the works of the women  artists over the centuries through personal portrait of illustrators and cartoonists.  The biographies will be illustrated by Italian authors with different styles and languages.The book is about  the lives of women artists really lived from prehistoric times until the middle of 1800 as Claricia, Artemisia Gentileschi, Lavinia Fontana, Sofonisba Anguissola, Judith Leyster and Camille Claudel.Artiste is a book of 100+ pages with comics and illustrations by:Erika Lerma / Arte preistorica (comics), Anna Ferrari / Grecia- Pittore di Leningrado (illustrations) ,Camilla Garofano / Claricia (illustrations) Alessia Feraciti / S.Caterina Vigri (illustrations ), Serena Ferrero  / Properzia de'Rossi (illustrations),  Alice Girlanda  / Sofonisba Anguissola (comics)Ambra Garlaschelli / Lavinia Fontana (illustrations) ,Chiara Fazi / Artemisia Gentileschi (comics) ,Sara Olmos / Judith Leyster  (illustrations),Luana Vecchio / Elisabetta Sirani (illustrations),Sumiti Collina  / Maria Sybilla Merian (comics) ,Ilaria Guarducci  / Rosalba Carriera (illustrations),Alessandra Centi / Anna Morandi Manzolini (illustrations), Silvia Beneforti / Angelika Kauffmann (illustrations), Martina F.Naldi / Maria Luigia Raggi (illustrations),Laura Proietti /  Élisabeth Vigée-Le Brun e Adélaïde Labille-Guiard (illustrations) ,Silvia Ballardini  Marie-Guillemine Benoist (comics) ,Elena Bia  / Sarah Goodridge (comics),Rosaria Battiloro / Julia Margaret Cameron (illustrations) ,Enrica Trevisan / Henriëtte Ronner-Knip (illustrations) ,Jessica Palumbo / Rosa Bonheur (comics),Flavia Luglioli  / Elizabeth Siddal (comics), Alma Federico /  Berthe Morisot (illustrations) ,Esther Alba Cristofori / Edmonia Lewis (comics),Cristina Sestilli / Mary Cassatt (illustrations) ,Elena Guidolin / Camille Claudel (comics),Silvia Rocchi / Suzanne Valadon (comics)Artiste è nato da Flavia e Irene Luglioli con il fondamentale supporto di Irene Barnes. Flavia è un illustratrice, insieme a sua sorella Irene ha creato La Mandragola, uno studio di legatoria artistica e illustrazione. L'idea per questo libro è nata da Flavia che da tempo voleva realizzare una piccola autoproduzione sull'artista vittoriana Elizabeth Siddal, poi, parlandone con altre illustratrici e fumettiste ha pensato di realizzare un libro sulle vite di Artiste spesso dimenticate dalla Storia dell'Arte. Insieme a Irene ha selezionato 27 biografie e le ha affidate ad altrettante illustratrici e fumettiste e infine ha coinvolto nel progetto Irene Barnes che ha realizzato tutta la grafica.  Laura Proietti -  Adélaïde Labille-Guiard [ENG]Artiste was born from Flavia and Irene Luglioli with the fundamental support of Irene Barnes.Flavia is an illustrator, along with her sister Irene has created La Mandragola, a study of artistic bookbinding and illustration. The idea for this book came from Flavia who wanted to make a small self production about Victorian artist Elizabeth Siddal, then, speaking with other illustrators and cartoonists she decided to develop a book on the Women Artist lives often forgotten by History . Along with Irene has selected 27 biographies and has assigned to  illustrators and cartoonist  and has involved  Irene Barnes that has created all the graphics of this project. >>> ATTENZIONE!Per i Perks Early Bird Book, ARTISTE Book Pack, ARTISTE Complete Book, ARTISTE Graphic Pack,  ARTISTE Graphic BIG Pack, ARTISTE Graphic BIGGER Pack ci sono due tipi di spedizioni:

<p>Long ago the mythical martial art known as Black phoenix ninjitsu was created by King Njongo to defend Kemet from physical and spiritual aggressors with their Falcon priest (J’Siris)  His disciples were Yaku, J’Siris, and Nzinga (Njongo’s daughter) known as the legendary Black phoenix trinity. To gain power Yaku betrayed the black phoenix destroying Njongo, and J’siris and sought Nzinga. However this ancient love triangle’s quarrell has greatly affected the world of the spirits and the living. Kamia Sugar Rush follows Jsiris’ reincarnate; Kamia as she attempts to survive the assaults from the spirit world. Journeying the world in search of a way to end the malice and maybe find her family.</p>
<h3>The world</h3>
<p>Aaru (or the field of reeds) is the heaven of Egyptian spirituality. The realm was very family-focused in ancient egypt as many egyptians typically only wanted to be with their loved ones in the after-life. Many depictions seen it as an endless field of reeds while our depiction of it is altered into a social mecca. Taking the image and embracing it to modern times and qualities.  The image of aaru is still a field of reeds on the surface but islands float in the sky connected by bridges of stars based on actual astrology. A river flows arcing across the sky for those who dare traverse its waters and explore the spiritual realm. A truly fascinating visual as the technology of the heavens combines astrology, and qi to provide energy through ancient structures like pyramids.</p>

<h3>Kamia</h3>
<p>The exploding protagonist you can’t help but love. Kamia is a fun active young girl that is way too energetic but tries to awkwardly fit in. A young orphan girl with no records of her parents. Kamia never felt as if anything was special about her. Talented but seemingly never rewarded for anything she accomplishes as all she wants is a family in a world that refuses to love her. Her only friend is the polar opposite of her, a wild child with a boy problem that somehow always manages to get Kamia to tag along into her chaos. Kamia is on a rough path personally taking chances because there seems to be nothing that matters. Once introduced to the spirit world Kamia finds that she is the reincarnation of the falcon priest who is supposed to bring balance to the spirit world. And Nzinga drags her into even crazier circumstances with monsters corrupted by the energy of Set,</p> <h3> </h3>
<h3>Nzinga</h3>
<p>Nzinga is a multi thousand year old black phoenix princess. Nzinga was a princess in her tribe in Kush. Though she was a princess she was always a bit out there. Outspoken, had a crazy love of action, gluttony an ugly laugh and ego as well as a habit to make a joke out of a everything but overall she was good hearted with a sense of humor. She was more renown for her beauty than her crazy ways. She fell in love with the then falcon priest J’siris.  But that ignited jealousy in her brother Yaku. Her father king Njongo gave her a mission to uncover the slave trade in Kemet to see the loyalty in J’Siris for his daughter. When she returned Yaku had dismembered J’siris into 14 pieces that she spent her life trying to piece together. She pieced him together but Yaku received a curse from Set that denied J’siris access to Aaru. Nzinga would give her life to bring the birth of the next Falcon Priestess; Kamia</p>
<p>Nzinga just so happened to suck at the blessing she died for and she cast it for a thousand years.</p>
<p>In the story She is a renowned trouble maker and terrible adventurer. Nzinga spends her time in the spirit world combating the corrupted but she really loves combat. And having fun, often preferring to dance in combat rather than win. She makes it over dramatic especially when the situation doesn’t need to be. She'll take attacks she could dodge with ease give a dramatic speech then drop a city wide cataclysm on an easy enemy. Is her ego a weakness? Duh but she also bares a soft spot for her husband J'siris' body, mind and soul. And she always has a way OP move up her sleeve and really thinks on her toes to defeat her enemies.</p>
<h3>Ankhy</h3>
<p>An Ankh soldier from Aaru’s forces. She was let go for unspecified reasons… (She sucked at her job) but landing in the spirit realm she chose to help Nzinga for the last century. This spirit is incredibly overconfident. Incredibly boisterous, egotistical and she has no problem talking down on others. She is actually very lazy, a bit of a hoarder and really a coward and a drunk.</p>
<p>When times are at their hardest you can basically expect her to do a pep-talk and jump into battle then do a very safe u-turn.</p>
<p>She really gets along well with Nzinga for some reason. She hypes Nzinga up and encourages the drama. She has her back but would quit paying attention to anyone completely if someone does something she doesen’t like.</p>
<h3>J’siris</h3>
<p>J'siris was the legendary Falcon priest. A soul set to be reincarnated and basically perform exorcisms throughout the land of Alkebulan. He sought out the black phoenix to learn how to control his energy and held a very close relationship with N’jongo.<br/>However he was also destined to provide peace to the spirits in our realm. Unlike anyone else his ka could manifest in the physical world. His flame was amazing but he only used it in the true world to combat evil spirits and djinn. The black phoenix  trains them cycle after cycle and he chose to align with black phoenix on his own.

Using his intel she pieced together the slave trade and began dismantling the invaders. The invaders were the kinsmen of the other half of his blood. His father's people. Once tempted with power, riches and money by his sister he was easily swayed. Not by the money or what could be given. But what could be taken. He felt that N'shaka, and J'siris were the only things hindering him N'shaka, and J'siris were the only things hindering him from taking the world with Black Phoenix Ninjitsu.

</div></div>","What is Kamia Sugar Rush?

a fantasy comic book. Featuring high-quality painting created with a combination of cgi software, and very detailed traditional and digital painting methods. Designed to create a sense of wonder and depth to better immerse users in this grand-universe. 

Long ago the mythical martial art known as Black phoenix ninjitsu was created by King Njongo to defend Kemet from physical and spiritual aggressors with their Falcon priest (J’Siris)  His disciples were Yaku, J’Siris, and Nzinga (Njongo’s daughter) known as the legendary Black phoenix trinity. To gain power Yaku betrayed the black phoenix destroying Njongo, and J’siris and sought Nzinga. However this ancient love triangle’s quarrell has greatly affected the world of the spirits and the living. Kamia Sugar Rush follows Jsiris’ reincarnate; Kamia as she attempts to survive the assaults from the spirit world. Journeying the world in search of a way to end the malice and maybe find her family.
The world
Aaru (or the field of reeds) is the heaven of Egyptian spirituality. The realm was very family-focused in ancient egypt as many egyptians typically only wanted to be with their loved ones in the after-life. Many depictions seen it as an endless field of reeds while our depiction of it is altered into a social mecca. Taking the image and embracing it to modern times and qualities.  The image of aaru is still a field of reeds on the surface but islands float in the sky connected by bridges of stars based on actual astrology. A river flows arcing across the sky for those who dare traverse its waters and explore the spiritual realm. A truly fascinating visual as the technology of the heavens combines astrology, and qi to provide energy through ancient structures like pyramids.

Kamia
The exploding protagonist you can’t help but love. Kamia is a fun active young girl that is way too energetic but tries to awkwardly fit in. A young orphan girl with no records of her parents. Kamia never felt as if anything was special about her. Talented but seemingly never rewarded for anything she accomplishes as all she wants is a family in a world that refuses to love her. Her only friend is the polar opposite of her, a wild child with a boy problem that somehow always manages to get Kamia to tag along into her chaos. Kamia is on a rough path personally taking chances because there seems to be nothing that matters. Once introduced to the spirit world Kamia finds that she is the reincarnation of the falcon priest who is supposed to bring balance to the spirit world. And Nzinga drags her into even crazier circumstances with monsters corrupted by the energy of Set,  
Nzinga
Nzinga is a multi thousand year old black phoenix princess. Nzinga was a princess in her tribe in Kush. Though she was a princess she was always a bit out there. Outspoken, had a crazy love of action, gluttony an ugly laugh and ego as well as a habit to make a joke out of a everything but overall she was good hearted with a sense of humor. She was more renown for her beauty than her crazy ways. She fell in love with the then falcon priest J’siris.  But that ignited jealousy in her brother Yaku. Her father king Njongo gave her a mission to uncover the slave trade in Kemet to see the loyalty in J’Siris for his daughter. When she returned Yaku had dismembered J’siris into 14 pieces that she spent her life trying to piece together. She pieced him together but Yaku received a curse from Set that denied J’siris access to Aaru. Nzinga would give her life to bring the birth of the next Falcon Priestess; Kamia
Nzinga just so happened to suck at the blessing she died for and she cast it for a thousand years.
In the story She is a renowned trouble maker and terrible adventurer. Nzinga spends her time in the spirit world combating the corrupted but she really loves combat. And having fun, often preferring to dance in combat rather than win. She makes it over dramatic especially when the situation doesn’t need to be. She'll take attacks she could dodge with ease give a dramatic speech then drop a city wide cataclysm on an easy enemy. Is her ego a weakness? Duh but she also bares a soft spot for her husband J'siris' body, mind and soul. And she always has a way OP move up her sleeve and really thinks on her toes to defeat her enemies.
Ankhy
An Ankh soldier from Aaru’s forces. She was let go for unspecified reasons… (She sucked at her job) but landing in the spirit realm she chose to help Nzinga for the last century. This spirit is incredibly overconfident. Incredibly boisterous, egotistical and she has no problem talking down on others. She is actually very lazy, a bit of a hoarder and really a coward and a drunk.
When times are at their hardest you can basically expect her to do a pep-talk and jump into battle then do a very safe u-turn.
She really gets along well with Nzinga for some reason. She hypes Nzinga up and encourages the drama. She has her back but would quit paying attention to anyone completely if someone does something she doesen’t like.
J’siris
J'siris was the legendary Falcon priest. A soul set to be reincarnated and basically perform exorcisms throughout the land of Alkebulan. He sought out the black phoenix to learn how to control his energy and held a very close relationship with N’jongo.However he was also destined to provide peace to the spirits in our realm. Unlike anyone else his ka could manifest in the physical world. His flame was amazing but he only used it in the true world to combat evil spirits and djinn. The black phoenix  trains them cycle after cycle and he chose to align with black phoenix on his own. The deepest mankind had ever gone was to spirit chi and it was nothing compared to his use of ka.
Yaku
He was a general underneath Njongo's army. Half blood and accepted in the land of his mother; Kush who recieved the same mission to investigiate Syria for information about the slave trade. Half syrian it was easy for him to infiltrate and find his father’s men. A master of black phoenix ninjitsu embued by Set with his own ka abilities nothing there could stop him. During this mission he grew lustful of Nzinga and he wanted Nzinga to himself. He tried with her while she was in captivity and she never returned his advances until she needed something from him. Using his intel she pieced together the slave trade and began dismantling the invaders. The invaders were the kinsmen of the other half of his blood. His father's people. Once tempted with power, riches and money by his sister he was easily swayed. Not by the money or what could be given. But what could be taken. He felt that N'shaka, and J'siris were the only things hindering him N'shaka, and J'siris were the only things hindering him from taking the world with Black Phoenix Ninjitsu. And with Nzinga by his side. To do so he gave the lives of those that accepted him to destroy the one she loved.

Deep below the ocean ice is an unexplored alien world unlike anywhere else on the planet. It's a place so incredible no scientist could resist...until a research team goes missing and a trio of elite divers are sent in to rescue them. Their mission is dangerous. Down right impossible. And will uncover a mystery that could unravel the Earth as we know it.Fans of sci-fi adventure comics like Fantastic Four and shows like Lost in Space and movies like The Abyss will enjoy this 2-part story. As part of the campaign you can grab:
Standard editions with connecting covers by Antonio Mastria
Deluxe print edition containing parts 1 and 2 in a wraparound cover
Polar Paradox theme song by Layne Thomas
Story and art commissions by the creative team
In addition to just being AWESOME, the standard covers for parts 1 and 2 by co-creator Antonio Mastria connect and the full undressed art is used as a wraparound cover the deluxe edition.  I read National Geographic religiously, and one of my favorite articles was about life under Antarctica’s sea ice. The story and its images detailed an alien world completely untouched by man, filled with bizarre creatures and natural phenomenon straight out of a science fiction tale. That’s how The Polar Paradox was born.As much as 95% of the world’s oceans remain unexplored. We like to think of it as a familiar place because of the way it’s depicted in media, but the truth is we have no idea what’s lurking down there. These are some of the most isolated places on earth, but they’re filled with life! It’s this secluded, unknown environment that serves as a prime setting for combining fans of survival adventure and sci-fi mystery. Over the years the comic community has exploded with a wide assortment of books. There have been amazing stories of horror, fantasy, noir, and more! Of course, sci-fi and adventure have been a staple of that group. Doesn't matter if it's superhero action or space epics, comic readers love a tale that stretches the imagination. The Polar Paradox will fit nicely as it fuses a little bit of everything, while grounding this sci-fi adventure mystery in a very real world that is still all too alien to us.The bulk of the funds raised by the campaign will go towards printing a small run. The books will be used for fulfilling the campaign as well as selling online, at conventions, and store signings. Leftover funds after printing will go towards other rewards and production expenses.Enjoy this preview of The Polar Paradox Part 1:We've been working on The Polar Paradox for a long time and we really appreciate you stopping by to visit our campaign.

The Devil explains that Alec's soul belongs to him but an angel pulls Alec out of Hell, away from the Devil and into Heaven where Alec meets God. God explains that the Devil arranged demons disguised as men to kill him before he could be saved, as the Devil knew that Julia's bible Alec read daily was starting to move him away from the Devil, closer to God and his wife (Julia) in Heaven. </p>

<p>In a world where powers can be bought for the right price, companies can control the heroes who protect the world. But not all are cut out for the job. Sometimes on rare occasion people are born with incredible powers too rich to be bought!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551319763/szwoxh79maotlo1xwz1e.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h2>Stafani Anders</h2>
<p>The main heroine of Fishtown Volume 1, Stafani is a late bloomer to the hero game. Discovering her powers accidently decides it's her duty to use them for the betterment of the world or at least Fishtown! Her powers are like nothing you've seen in comics. She has animal-like reflexes, laser boobs! When her hand is in the shape of a gun and only a gun she can refill any beverage, thats why shes the best person to bring to a party!! Now if that doesn't sound interesting enough  and need to know more, no problem.</p>
<h3><strong>A New World</strong></h3>
<p>In this universe a company created a viable solution to humans next step in evolution. That company; International Power Plant Industries formed 34 years ago. Providing a service to the world through injections that would give powered abilities to the buyer. Level of injection determines the level of power(s). With this new market, corporations and the wealthy jumped on the Hero Boat. But only the true will prevail! Fishtown takes you a rollercoaster with crazy characters and even crazier villains!</p>

<h2>Greetings!</h2>
<p>I'm David Deforne! Thanks so much for taking the time to check out my project, Fishtown Volume 1! This story has been in the works for the last 6 years! I have always loved comics and dreamed of making it my living. The time to make it reality is now. I promise to dedicate and produce the best product I can for fans and supporters.</p>
<p>Fishtown is a comic for anyone in love with comics, saturday morning cartoons, movies so bad they're good, and toys lines from the 90's. This series will offer clever satire, combined with fast and dismembering super-powered fights, action packed with a sprinkle of  pop culture references  thrown in for good measure! You'll be introduced to a colorful and odd cast of characters and exposed to a world that's so familiar yet so fresh!</p>
<p>This book is intended for young adult readers ages 13+ as it contains partial nudity, cats, violence, body dismemberment, cronenberg mutations, sexy women, suggestive themes and strong language. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Campaign Goal</h2>
<p>This campaign has a fixed goal of $5,000 to produce the first  print run of Fishtown Volume #1! The digital and retail versions of this comic will become available after the printed comics have made their way to their respective backers.</p>
<h2>PERKS</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551392033/oyepu8pdg5rsuxdrlsad.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>During your time in Fishtown, you and the team will encounter these ""HULKED CATS"" that our heroes will have to do battle with. There are two perks that allow your pet become hulked out!</p>
<h3><strong>$150 Your Pet Hulked out</strong></h3>
<p>This Perk Level will have your pet hulked out in the back of the book in the ""Hulked Gallery"". This perk is available for any and all animals such as cat, dog, bird, lizard, insect, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>$200 Cat Hulked in the Comic</strong></h3>

</ul></div>","In a world where powers can be bought for the right price, companies can control the heroes who protect the world. But not all are cut out for the job. Sometimes on rare occasion people are born with incredible powers too rich to be bought!

Stafani Anders
The main heroine of Fishtown Volume 1, Stafani is a late bloomer to the hero game. Discovering her powers accidently decides it's her duty to use them for the betterment of the world or at least Fishtown! Her powers are like nothing you've seen in comics. She has animal-like reflexes, laser boobs! When her hand is in the shape of a gun and only a gun she can refill any beverage, thats why shes the best person to bring to a party!! Now if that doesn't sound interesting enough  and need to know more, no problem.
A New World
In this universe a company created a viable solution to humans next step in evolution. That company; International Power Plant Industries formed 34 years ago. Providing a service to the world through injections that would give powered abilities to the buyer. Level of injection determines the level of power(s). With this new market, corporations and the wealthy jumped on the Hero Boat. But only the true will prevail! Fishtown takes you a rollercoaster with crazy characters and even crazier villains!

Sample Pages 



 

Greetings!
I'm David Deforne! Thanks so much for taking the time to check out my project, Fishtown Volume 1! This story has been in the works for the last 6 years! I have always loved comics and dreamed of making it my living. The time to make it reality is now. I promise to dedicate and produce the best product I can for fans and supporters.
Fishtown is a comic for anyone in love with comics, saturday morning cartoons, movies so bad they're good, and toys lines from the 90's. This series will offer clever satire, combined with fast and dismembering super-powered fights, action packed with a sprinkle of  pop culture references  thrown in for good measure! You'll be introduced to a colorful and odd cast of characters and exposed to a world that's so familiar yet so fresh!
This book is intended for young adult readers ages 13+ as it contains partial nudity, cats, violence, body dismemberment, cronenberg mutations, sexy women, suggestive themes and strong language. 
 

Campaign Goal
This campaign has a fixed goal of $5,000 to produce the first  print run of Fishtown Volume #1! The digital and retail versions of this comic will become available after the printed comics have made their way to their respective backers.
PERKS

During your time in Fishtown, you and the team will encounter these ""HULKED CATS"" that our heroes will have to do battle with. There are two perks that allow your pet become hulked out!
$150 Your Pet Hulked out
This Perk Level will have your pet hulked out in the back of the book in the ""Hulked Gallery"". This perk is available for any and all animals such as cat, dog, bird, lizard, insect, etc.
$200 Cat Hulked in the Comic
This Perk Level will have our heroes battle your very own four legged friend in the pages of the story! This is a VERY limited perk, and unfortunately only available to cats.
*IMPORTANT*

<p>Rome, 1967: a Vatican exorcist turns on, tunes in, and drops out to fight monsters with Future Chick, time traveling super-hippie from a heavy tomorrow, and Major Bitch, far out freedom fighting yeti-slayer. <strong>Murder Vibes From The Monster Dimension</strong> delivers 100 throbbing pages of psychedelic horror carved from the sexy imagination of Phil Mucci, conjured by the black arts of Mike Dubisch!</p>
<p>The first <strong>Professor Dario Bava</strong> graphic novel, <strong>Murder Vibes From The Monster Dimension </strong>contains three complete tales: ""Blood Puppets of the Fiendish Manitou"", in which Father Bava conducts his last and deadliest exorcism for the Vatican, ""The Future Blows, Dude!"" in which Future Chick discovers her powers in a world of ravenous horrors, and ""The Bastard Birthright of Major Bitch"" in which an American army brat runs away in post-war Europe to fight for justice against men and monsters.

Inspired by the work of Frank Frazetta and Averado Ciriello, he created striking art for Zora the Vampire, Belzeba, Cimiteria, Sukia, Stregoneria (“Witchcraft”), Gli Spettri (“The Spectres”), Il Sanguinari (“The Blood”), Lo Schelectro (“The Skeleton”), Ulula (“Howls”), Vampirissimo and Wallestein. His worldwide reputation continues to grow to this day, culminating in 2015 with the gorgeous Sex and Horror: The Art of Emanuele Taglietti, a book by Mark Alfrey, celebrating Taglietti’s work.
Suspiria (Susana Vilchez) - Guest Artist, ""Camila""
Born in Barcelona, multimedia artist Suspiria is inspired by female anatomy, 70’s and 80's horror flicks, dark comics, and the holiest of holies, Halloween! A student of art, fashion, and graphic design in Barcelona and the Canary Islands, she's had many solo and group art shows in Europe, Canada, and the United States. Her spooky handmade Terror Tots, created for cuddling, are all uniquely hand-painted on a variety of supple fabrics. Suspiria currently has a studio in Toronto, where she's a custom tattoo artist while working on multimedia projects and shows.
Jill Janus - Huntress, Heshette
One of Diabolik's longtime collaborators, Jill Janus of Huntress  is as rad as they come! To celebrate Professor Dario Bava's first appearance in ""Sorrow"", Jill Janus crafted a special witch box just for you! We're also adding 3 Huntress ""Sorrow"" posters to the package, including a limited edition of the painting of Jill and the Baroness Karnstein that appeared in the video! Check out the update for more details, and see more of Jill's witchy delights at Heshette!
NOTE: Since the launch of this campaign, Jill has sadly passed away. In honor of her memory, creativity, and support, we'll be dedicating the graphic novel to her. Rest in Power, Mighty Jill!
Rob Israel - Guest Artist, ""Professor Dario Bava vs. The Thing""
Dallas based illustrator/designer Rob Israel spent 13 years in the licensed apparel business before branching out on his own. He's designed t-shirts and posters for established musical acts from the world of edm, punk, and metal. His style ranges from low-brow, psychedelic work to more traditional comic art. He's inspired by everything - from pop culture, to comics, horror art, and politics, and has built a strong social media following where he features new work every day. 
Nick ""The Hat"" Gucker - Guest Artist, ""Dario Bava vs. Legions""
We're proud to announce our third collaboration with Nick The Hat! Diabolik fans might remember Nick's work from Das Muerte ""All Those Delicate Cuts"", and Monster Magnet ""The Duke"", but he's most well known for his creepy, psychedelic posters, book covers, and HP Lovecraft illustrations. Winner of the Pickman’s Apprentice Iron Artist challenge, Nick had the honor of creating artwork for the 2013 HP Lovecraft Film Festival posters and merchandise. His work has appeared in group shows from Alaska to Rhode Island, and his first solo show, “A Compendium of Curious Creeps” ran for two months in 2014 at Spectrum House in Seattle. 
Carolina Rodriguez Fuenmayor - Guest Artist, ""Miranda""
Based in Bogotá, Colombia, Carolina's unique visual style combines line drawing illustration with digital art and graphic design. ""I would like my work to be able to show universes in which the human figure, galaxies, and nature become one... subverting everyday life and boredom, providing them with fantasy, surrealism, and science fiction."" We first discovered her work on Brut Magazine's Instagram feed, and we were thrilled when she agreed to do her own interpretation of the graphic novel's villainess, Miranda Korday.

<h3>Now it’s time to talk seriously, lets talk about money. </h3>
<p>So what do I need? well any money raised will go on 2 things:</p>

<p>As my daughter is the inspiration for my comic, I want to write a story that she can proud of, and I hope the reader can feel the love, care and attention that I’ve put into the story.  And besides this world can always do with another fun story to warm people’s hearts, as its way too serious already.</p>
<p>So that’s what you’re gonna get if you back this comic, a fun exciting read for all ages, well I think so anyway and I hope you do too.</p>

<br/>What this IndieGoGo campaign WILL be:</h3><p>My goal with this campaign is to finance time to work on ODDLY NORMAL BOOK 4 by pre-selling signed copies of my 200 comps, the copies of the finished book that Image Comics gives me with each printing. I usually sell these comp copies at comic conventions and other personal appearances after the book is released. By pre-selling them via this IndieGoGo campaign, I hope to raise a small amount of money that will allow me to take on less freelance work for a few months and focus solely on finishing ODDLY NORMAL BOOK 4.</p><h3>What this IndieGoGo campaign will NOT be:</h3><p>Unlike most comic book-based IndieGoGo campaigns, I am not a self-publisher and it is not my intention to sell as many books as possible with the goal of raising a large amount of money. ODDLY NORMAL has been and will continue to be published by Image Comics. I am not in the business of printing and publishing books. I love having a publisher and I’m thrilled that Image Comics continues to support the series. For that reason, I am only selling a limited amount of copies of ODDLY NORMAL BOOK 4 (the aforementioned 200 comp copies) and I will not be offering a digital version of the book as a reward, as all digital sales are done through Image Comics and their partnership with ComiXology. I am only pre-selling my own personal comp copies of ODDLY NORMAL books, as well as prints and drawings. These are the only rewards that I have to offer, and this will determine the limited goal of this campaign. And that goal is all about taking time off from freelance work for a few months to finish ODDLY NORMAL BOOK 4.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559322657/kdb2sjzpnfzsbzc3dc5s.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Here is a detailed breakdown of the IndieGoGo Perks Tiers...</h3><p><u><strong>Tier 1:</strong></u></p><p><strong>ODDLY NORMAL TIP JAR!</strong></p><p>-Help me make ODDLY NORMAL BOOK 4 a reality and get exclusive updates on the production of the book here on IndieGoGo!

<h3>THE SKETCHBOOK IS HEADING TO THE PRINTER</h3>
<p>We've received the rough of the sketchbook and Steve has approved it!  The digital version is available once funds clear around July 19th.  Books expected to ship early August!  Steve gives a sneak peek of both the 2021 sketchbook and his new masterpiece: Nexus: The Coming of Gourmando, also shipping in August.</p>

<h3>HISTORY OF STEVE RUDE SKETCHBOOKS</h3>
<p>Steve Rude started producing sketchbooks in 2003.  Back then everyone was doing cheap Kinko's copies.  Even back then Steve knew that quality came first, and we put together an 8½x11"" professionally printed black and white book.  That book was entirely made up of pages from Steve's private sketchbook that he would show around at comic conventions.  Over the years the book has grown, and is now full color, includes many of the popular comic characters that Steve does during the year, but, true to the beginnings, it contains many pages direct from Steve' private sketchbooks.</p>

<h3>NEXUS: THE COMING OF GOURMANDO</h3>
<p>Due to COVID 19 shipping delays, the Hardcover version of the Gourmando book will not ship until August.  Because this is the same time as our 2021 Sketchbook should be shipped we are offering some packages including the book!  <a href=""http://www.SteveRude.com/Gourmando"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SteveRude.com/Gourmando</a> for details on the book or watch the videos!</p>
<h3>UPGRADES / CHECKOKUT</h3>
<p>While we do collect most payments and addresses via Indiegogo, we do have a final checkout via BackerKit.  Backerkit is how we finalize and organize the campaign to ensure your order is correct and doesn't get lost or misplaced.</p>
<p>When you checkout via Backerkit, if you ordered an unsigned copy you will have the opportunity to upgrade to a signed copy for only $5.  You may also upgrade the cover from the Wonder Woman cover to the White Queen alternative cover for only $10 (+$15 w/signature).  You will also be able to customize a package ordering extra copies, past books, prints, etc.</p>
<p>CHECK OUT RIGHT AWAY when funds clear around July 19th and you can add a FREE bonus gift via Add-Ons.</p>
<h3>FREE SHIPPING ON INTERNATIONAL ORDERS </h3>
<p>If you order $200, contact us and we will arrange free shipping.  See the FAQs for details.</p>
<h3>TURN AROUND</h3>
<p>This book is already nearing the end of production.  We are expecting the hardcopy proof in house around June 10th and barring tons of changes from Steve we should have final files to the printer by June 14th which puts shipping around the 1st part of August.</p>
<p>No Deadline for the Deals</p>
<p>Because this is a quick turn around project and we plan to use funds to help with shipping costs, the actual campaign will be short, however, we will continue to offer packages via IndieGoGo InDemand until our next Kickstarter is launched in a few months.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been self publishing books since 2003 with our first ""Steve Rude Sketchbook"".  We pride ourselves on quality and communication.  Things don't always go as planned, especially with COVID shipping delays and other factors.  If errors are caught before printing Steve has been known to stop the presses to get it fixed.  Quality over</p>

All presale books will come with immediate access (upon funding) to the digital flipbook version of the sketchbook. 


NEXUS: THE COMING OF GOURMANDO
Due to COVID 19 shipping delays, the Hardcover version of the Gourmando book will not ship until August.  Because this is the same time as our 2021 Sketchbook should be shipped we are offering some packages including the book!  SteveRude.com/Gourmando for details on the book or watch the videos!
UPGRADES / CHECKOKUT
While we do collect most payments and addresses via Indiegogo, we do have a final checkout via BackerKit.  Backerkit is how we finalize and organize the campaign to ensure your order is correct and doesn't get lost or misplaced.
When you checkout via Backerkit, if you ordered an unsigned copy you will have the opportunity to upgrade to a signed copy for only $5.  You may also upgrade the cover from the Wonder Woman cover to the White Queen alternative cover for only $10 (+$15 w/signature).  You will also be able to customize a package ordering extra copies, past books, prints, etc.
CHECK OUT RIGHT AWAY when funds clear around July 19th and you can add a FREE bonus gift via Add-Ons.
FREE SHIPPING ON INTERNATIONAL ORDERS 
If you order $200, contact us and we will arrange free shipping.  See the FAQs for details.
TURN AROUND
This book is already nearing the end of production.  We are expecting the hardcopy proof in house around June 10th and barring tons of changes from Steve we should have final files to the printer by June 14th which puts shipping around the 1st part of August.
No Deadline for the Deals
Because this is a quick turn around project and we plan to use funds to help with shipping costs, the actual campaign will be short, however, we will continue to offer packages via IndieGoGo InDemand until our next Kickstarter is launched in a few months.

Risks & Challenges
We have been self publishing books since 2003 with our first ""Steve Rude Sketchbook"".  We pride ourselves on quality and communication.  Things don't always go as planned, especially with COVID shipping delays and other factors.  If errors are caught before printing Steve has been known to stop the presses to get it fixed.  Quality over

<h3>To the Exceptional People who continue to support NEXUS</h3>
<p>How many of you miss the simple excitement from these bygone years, and wished it would return? As two creators that entered the comic field in 1981, publisher and artist Steve Rude, along with partner and Nexus creator Mike Baron, wanted to move our industry forward by returning to something that made the popularity of comics what it was. It was time for someone to revive the excitement of the Adventure strips, and we’d begin by adapting it to our longtime creation Nexus. </p>
<p>Five years ago, Rude Dude Productions reintroduced something that the world of publishing had thought virtually extinct; the full-page Sunday newspaper adventure strip.   For a while, I’ve been asking, “What happened to the American comic strip?” Reduced almost microscopically by the 1970’s, I’ve wondered the same. So, with no one limiting us but ourselves, in 2015, we began adapting the award-winning Nexus comic book into a Sunday newspaper strip.  we’re happy to finally announce that the entirety of these Nexus strips will now be published in one massive collection.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever ordered from us knows we care about the quality.  This is not a ""kinkos"" handmade book.  All our books (and everything we do) is top quality, professionally printed, thick stock, archival safe, and we spend thousands on sturdy shipping containers, mailers, tubes, and packaging to get those items to you safely.  If something is damaged we will replace it on request.  Back us and support quality and high standards.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>There are many of writers, artists, and storytellers in the world.  But truthfully, there are not a lot of people that can do it all.  I'm talking about creators that can combine art and words into a cohesive package.  I'm talking about visual storytellers.</p>
<p>Visual Storytellers Comic Showcase Issue #1 highlights a few of the elite visual storytellers Kool, Lue Sang, and Scott.</p>
<p>Brad Scott Studios (BSS) has decided to step into the publishing realm to give independent comic creators opportunities they may not be able to get with the big companies.  There is talent out there that needs to be highlighted and BSS wants to be the place to deliver that talent to you.  So for our inaugural issue, we wanted to showcase a few of the total package creators.</p>
<p>The Artist known as Kool as Heck, Brian Lue Sang, and Brad Scott have created independent comics, beautiful illustrations, stunning stories, and graced the show floor at numerous comic conventions throughout the southeast United States.  Each creator brings a unique style to the Visual Storytellers Comic Showcase to enchant you with 5 short stories (<u>Mature Content</u>): </p>
<p><strong><i>Icarus</i></strong> - A school essay reveals a teenager's hopes and goals. (Kool)</p>
<p><i><strong>Tatter</strong></i> - A down on his luck former hero gets a serious wake up call. (Kool)</p>
<p><i><strong>Movie Night</strong></i> - Love is in the air when a simple mugging goes wrong. (Scott)</p>
<p><i><strong>Head Hunters</strong></i> - Man versus beast versus woman in the land of the minotaur. (Scott)</p>
<p><i><strong>The Deep</strong></i> - Using antiquated equipment, a diver embarks on a journey that turns out to be far more than it initially seems. (Lue Sang)</p>
<p>Each story written and drawn by the creator themselves.  The Comic Showcase is over 50-pages of creator-owned storytelling.</p>
<p>Being and independent artist is hard, but the work is extremely satisfying.  Taking a blank piece of paper from a twinkle of a thought in your mind to a graphic story enjoyed by others is quite a breathtaking accomplishment.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering supporting us on our journey as independent comic creators.  We are so proud to share these 5 short stories as we delve into the fantasy realm.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
There are many of writers, artists, and storytellers in the world.  But truthfully, there are not a lot of people that can do it all.  I'm talking about creators that can combine art and words into a cohesive package.  I'm talking about visual storytellers.
Visual Storytellers Comic Showcase Issue #1 highlights a few of the elite visual storytellers Kool, Lue Sang, and Scott.
Brad Scott Studios (BSS) has decided to step into the publishing realm to give independent comic creators opportunities they may not be able to get with the big companies.  There is talent out there that needs to be highlighted and BSS wants to be the place to deliver that talent to you.  So for our inaugural issue, we wanted to showcase a few of the total package creators.
The Artist known as Kool as Heck, Brian Lue Sang, and Brad Scott have created independent comics, beautiful illustrations, stunning stories, and graced the show floor at numerous comic conventions throughout the southeast United States.  Each creator brings a unique style to the Visual Storytellers Comic Showcase to enchant you with 5 short stories (Mature Content): 
Icarus - A school essay reveals a teenager's hopes and goals. (Kool)
Tatter - A down on his luck former hero gets a serious wake up call. (Kool)
Movie Night - Love is in the air when a simple mugging goes wrong. (Scott)
Head Hunters - Man versus beast versus woman in the land of the minotaur. (Scott)
The Deep - Using antiquated equipment, a diver embarks on a journey that turns out to be far more than it initially seems. (Lue Sang)
Each story written and drawn by the creator themselves.  The Comic Showcase is over 50-pages of creator-owned storytelling.
Being and independent artist is hard, but the work is extremely satisfying.  Taking a blank piece of paper from a twinkle of a thought in your mind to a graphic story enjoyed by others is quite a breathtaking accomplishment.
Thank you for considering supporting us on our journey as independent comic creators.  We are so proud to share these 5 short stories as we delve into the fantasy realm.

The Creators
Kool as Heck 
Kool has been an independent and freelance artist for over 3 decades.  His keystone comics Evenfall and Brisingamen has graced comic store shelves throughout the country.  He creates trading cards for Marvel/Upper Deck/ and Fleer.

Brian Lue Sang

Brad Scott
Brad is an art practioner in traditional and digital media.  His table top role playing game Lords of the Labyrinth allows him to share his art and storytelling in unique ways.

Our Goals
We are raising money to pay for color printing.  These days it's pretty easy to create a product and distribute it digitally to the masses.  But the truth is, nothing beast holding a physical comic book in your hands.  Kool, Brian, and Brad all create art traditionally and digitally, but original artwork on paper boards is just stunning.   We are also comic lovers and spend untold hours in comic book stores.  Every comic creator dreams of having their work on the shelves of their favorite comic store.
We don't want to make this complicated, we just want to print and sell our comic book.

To say Thank You for supporting our creation, we are offering some great perks including:

Multiple Covers
Signed and Graded Comic Books
Original Sketch Cover Art
Comic Shop Bundles

The Big Deal
This is the first published comic from Brad Scott Studios.  Success on Issue #1 also means the chance to give a shot to more creators on Issue #2 and beyond.  We want to continually support independent creators and give them a chance to ""get on the shelf"".

Stretch Goals

Challenges

Our biggest challenge is printing the comic book in color.  Before this funding campaign launched we spent several months brainstorming, writing, and drawing.  We wanted to make sure we had a great product to promote.  The stories are complete, the drawings are complete, and we are in the coloring phase.  By the time this campaign is over we should be reviewing the proofs and approving the final comic Book.

These fees may include taxes, duties, processing fees, brokerage fees, etc. We have no control over the amount or assessment of these fees. We will not mark items as a ""gift."" If you are not familiar with the customs laws and fees in your country, please check with your local customs office for more information.
It is possible that the delivery of your order could be delayed due to customs processing. If your order does not arrive in a reasonable amount of time, you should check with your local customs office to see if they are holding the package for payment of fees.
We know that international shipping has gotten very expensive, but unfortunately that is out of our control. We make no money from the shipping fees and actually end up subsidizing some of the shipping costs due to campaign fees, credit card processing fees, packaging costs, etc.",17.0,0,"12 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hello I am Samuel Vera. I am an indie Comic Creator and podcaster for ""Catch Da Craze"" . I have been creating my own comics since 2000. In fact, I first created and wrote Forbidden© in May of 2000. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">I self produced Forbidden© in 2005 with interior art by Artist Anibal Arroyo. With only two issues released and a dozen amazing Critic reviews, I found myself walking away from comics for 10 years. Several friends of mine persuaded me to finish the series and produce it independently. If You are a fan of Epic Fantasy stories, you will enjoy the journey I am about to take you on.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE PREMISE</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>For centuries they've hidden, lost forever to the world. Buried beneath the confines of a curse cast upon the sins of their fathers. Now, one will challenge that very curse which has enslaved a people. Standing in opposition of a mighty ruler, a revered King, defying all that has been built to protect them. One man... one vision... one chance to escape the evil or risk destroying everything. Walk with me as I take you on a Journey into the Forbidden©. </i></strong></p>

20 YEARS IN THE MAKING
WOW! I can't believe we are here...
Hello I am Samuel Vera. I am an indie Comic Creator and podcaster for ""Catch Da Craze"" . I have been creating my own comics since 2000. In fact, I first created and wrote Forbidden© in May of 2000. 

Cover by Artist Anibal Arroyo
""An Epic Masterpiece that is a MUST READ""! – Paul Dale Roberts 
I self produced Forbidden© in 2005 with interior art by Artist Anibal Arroyo. With only two issues released and a dozen amazing Critic reviews, I found myself walking away from comics for 10 years. Several friends of mine persuaded me to finish the series and produce it independently. If You are a fan of Epic Fantasy stories, you will enjoy the journey I am about to take you on.
THE PREMISE
For centuries they've hidden, lost forever to the world. Buried beneath the confines of a curse cast upon the sins of their fathers. Now, one will challenge that very curse which has enslaved a people. Standing in opposition of a mighty ruler, a revered King, defying all that has been built to protect them. One man... one vision... one chance to escape the evil or risk destroying everything. Walk with me as I take you on a Journey into the Forbidden©. 
""An intriguing Fantasy setting with good strong dialogue"". – Silverbulletcomicbooks.com

Cover by Artist David Quiles
You will Learn about the Nocturnals and how they were cursed for centuries to remain underground. 
You will learn about the legend that calls for the destruction of Nocron at the hands of the son of Voxe.
You will learn about Nocron and his quest for Global Dominance in the form of Billionaire David Hunter. 

STOP! NO SPOILERS! 
WHAT DO YOU GET
This is the first introduction issue we numbered ""0"" for several reasons.
This is a 16 Page intro story with 8 Bonus pages of World Maps, character bios and history + 4 Pages of Guest Art for a Total of 32 Pages

Your support will help me get Forbidden© colored and produced to get in your hands and comic shops. The eventual goal will be to collect all 6 issues into one book. All books are penciled, inked and lettered. While they look great in black and white, they would look so much better in full color. 
There are so many perks available from

Standard covers
Holofoil Covers
Gold Covers
Sketch Cards
Pin-Ups
Sketchbooks
Tee-Shirts
Sketch Covers
And more is we unlock Stretch Goals

Each of our Zagor books is a complete story. and this is our first Zagor book on Indiegogo! </p><p>When created back in 1961 In Italy and published by Sergio Bonelli Editore,<strong> Zagor</strong> was a series quite ahead of its time, as it mixes various genre: western, adventure, sci-fi, fantasy, and even horror. Now if you are counting the years then you may notice that this year marks Zagor’s 60th year anniversary that the very first Zagor story was published in Italy. Rest assured, for such a big year as this, we have a few surprises up our sleeve. Although over the years Zagor has been published in Italy, France, Croatia, Serbia, Brazil, Turkey, Greece etc., and has millions of fans across the globe, we (Epicenter Comics) were the first company to bring this international hero in English language. It's a fact that we have always held as a special honor!</p><p> </p><h3>This book</h3><p><i><strong>Zagor: The Great Conspiracy</strong></i>, was created by the duo you haven’t met yet on pages of Zagor by Epicenter Comics, by the writer <strong>Alfredo Castelli</strong> (the creator of Martin Mystery) and the artist <strong>Francesco Donatelli.</strong>  This particular story has always been in my Zagor top five comics of all-time! As you can imagine from the title alone, it is a story about diabolical grand schemes by a mastermind, and one of the most compelling villains in Zagor series ever: <strong>The Weaver. </strong>And to face this mastermind, Zagor, who is also known as The Spirit with the Hatchet and also The King of Darkwood, will have to let himself be completely entangled in The Weaver’s web of intrigue. Needles to say there will be countless moments of sheer exhilaration and one of the most thrilling moments in the whole series, but you will have to see it for yourself!</p><p> </p><p>This book will be <strong>6” x 9”, 420 full-color pages printed on glossy 128 gsm paper, softcover.</strong> It will be offered in two versions, with new, main cover by Michele Rubini and colored by Well-Bee and also the classic cover by Gallieno Ferri, for which we also used the raw scan of the original, to which Well-Bee then added his coloring magic.</p><p><strong>Whatever you do, please make sure you scroll to the end and check out bellow the awesome Super Stretch Goal that we are preparing! </strong></p><p>Here are the few spoiler-free inside pages from this gripping adventure:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654798/b0zk3gvj4q1k00pu0p4s.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654830/lnl9g7uol1ibtnoupzig.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654863/goeua6luasm1gb4khkbz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654891/fdnwpoy5ublfvzu0aroo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654925/jwrojbhomerllp7a1qht.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616654959/lnxjbncjrxdyr589nucl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Perks</h3><p><strong>Two book versions</strong></p><p><strong>Rubini's ninja cover version:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616655226/rtbkaz301xwahqckpxnz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Ferri's classic cover version:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616655291/twfpofyzptcpswhh5cny.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Other Perks:</h2><p>If you look into Perks section you will find that we are offering all sorts of perk bundles with various combinations of our Zagor books, as well as interesting combo bundles such as <strong>Editor's Favorites Bundle</strong> which along with the new book, features four of my favorite books that we have published so far.  Also, there are couple of bundles that will help people who are trying to catch up with our Zagor books, such as <strong>Zagor Big Sampler Bundle</strong>, <strong>Zagor Deluxe Bundle</strong>, and the mother of all bundles: <strong>Our Whole Zagor Collection </strong>(which contains ALL of our Zagor books, and Michele Rubini covers), and is limited to only 5 bundles and includes the sold out first edition of Terror from the Sea (that just few months ago I have found the last few remaining copies of, when I was organizing the storage!).

Now it is time for our 11th Zagor graphic novel! Each of our Zagor books is a complete story. and this is our first Zagor book on Indiegogo! When created back in 1961 In Italy and published by Sergio Bonelli Editore, Zagor was a series quite ahead of its time, as it mixes various genre: western, adventure, sci-fi, fantasy, and even horror. Now if you are counting the years then you may notice that this year marks Zagor’s 60th year anniversary that the very first Zagor story was published in Italy. Rest assured, for such a big year as this, we have a few surprises up our sleeve. Although over the years Zagor has been published in Italy, France, Croatia, Serbia, Brazil, Turkey, Greece etc., and has millions of fans across the globe, we (Epicenter Comics) were the first company to bring this international hero in English language. It's a fact that we have always held as a special honor! This bookZagor: The Great Conspiracy, was created by the duo you haven’t met yet on pages of Zagor by Epicenter Comics, by the writer Alfredo Castelli (the creator of Martin Mystery) and the artist Francesco Donatelli.  This particular story has always been in my Zagor top five comics of all-time! As you can imagine from the title alone, it is a story about diabolical grand schemes by a mastermind, and one of the most compelling villains in Zagor series ever: The Weaver. And to face this mastermind, Zagor, who is also known as The Spirit with the Hatchet and also The King of Darkwood, will have to let himself be completely entangled in The Weaver’s web of intrigue. Needles to say there will be countless moments of sheer exhilaration and one of the most thrilling moments in the whole series, but you will have to see it for yourself! This book will be 6” x 9”, 420 full-color pages printed on glossy 128 gsm paper, softcover. It will be offered in two versions, with new, main cover by Michele Rubini and colored by Well-Bee and also the classic cover by Gallieno Ferri, for which we also used the raw scan of the original, to which Well-Bee then added his coloring magic.Whatever you do, please make sure you scroll to the end and check out bellow the awesome Super Stretch Goal that we are preparing! Here are the few spoiler-free inside pages from this gripping adventure:  PerksTwo book versionsRubini's ninja cover version: Ferri's classic cover version: Other Perks:If you look into Perks section you will find that we are offering all sorts of perk bundles with various combinations of our Zagor books, as well as interesting combo bundles such as Editor's Favorites Bundle which along with the new book, features four of my favorite books that we have published so far.  Also, there are couple of bundles that will help people who are trying to catch up with our Zagor books, such as Zagor Big Sampler Bundle, Zagor Deluxe Bundle, and the mother of all bundles: Our Whole Zagor Collection (which contains ALL of our Zagor books, and Michele Rubini covers), and is limited to only 5 bundles and includes the sold out first edition of Terror from the Sea (that just few months ago I have found the last few remaining copies of, when I was organizing the storage!). Also, there are many add-on books to help you with filling your collection and they can simply be added to your pledge at the check out! And now...The stretch goals and the big surprise!For this Zagor book, we have two stretch goalsSmall Stretch Goal of reaching $7000, which would unlock the special gifts for all the book pledgers:
two sided 8"" x 12"" Zagor glossy poster 
two sided Zagor bookmark
 And then, there is a Super Stretch Goal of $11000, for which I am just too excited, and that is: Michele Rubini’s oversized hardcover artbook!!One of the really cool things about this Artbook that I wish we create, besides the fact that it will contain all the amazing Michele’s covers that he has made for us over the years, in both, full color and black and white, and all of his other greatest illustrations, is that this Artbook will not be sold anywhere, and if we reach that Super Stretch Goal then, read this slowly:EACH person who pledges on ANY of the rewards with EVEN a single book, gets this deluxe Artbook absolutely FREE, with no added extra shipping fee!!! Basically we need to meet the critical mass, and then we all celebrate!And here are the technical specifications of the Michele Rubini Artbook:
oversized, 8.5” x 11” 
hardcover
64 pages 
printed on heavy 157 gsm paper
each book numbered 
This is a special treat for you and for us at Epicenter Comics!If sold this Artbook alone would cost $15-20 plus shipping, but it will not be for sale, as it can only be obtained through Indiegogo by the pledgers!Here is the Artbook cover and some sample pages: Thank you for your support and for being an essential part of this project!Sincerely, Igor MaricicPublisher, Epicenter Comics",15.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Xarde Synopsis</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Xarde is a fantasy adventure comic book about a young, feckless woman living in the modern world who realizes she has innate, nascent dragon-like powers.  She inherits the Sword of the Dragon Warden and must come to terms with her thrice-cursed existence.</p>
<p>Xarde has been trapped in the modern world not realizing she is from another, medieval, world where Dragons and Devils are real.  She must overcome the challenge of her past while figuring out her place in the strange new reality she finds herself in.</p>
<p>Xarde #1: The Dragoness is Act I of a 4-part series that tells the story of Xarde’s discovery of her powers, the legend of her father’s sword, and the inevitable collision between our world and the Hellscape from which she comes.</p>

<p><br/><i>Note from the creator:</i></p>
<p>Xarde #1: The Dragoness is 80% complete and this Indiegogo campaign looks only to raise the funds to send her to print!  I would very much love to have you join me and the team of very talented artists on this project to help with it's launch. This will ensure that Xarde's story can be told and the epic of her life can continue not only in these first 4 parts, but beyond as well.  Thank you very much for your interest in this project and I cannot wait to see Xarde come forth into the real world in her 24 page First Act!<br/><br/>L.

<p>Once we have the Mike Krome coaster in our rear view mirror, we'd like to make a set of collectible trade/sketch cards of the Xarde concept art!

'Well hello, Xarde' I would say to it. Half expecting an answer.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The budget for pencils, inks, colors and letters for 24 interior comic book pages and multiple cover/splash images has already been financed and completed.</p>
<p>Your campaign dollars will go to printing, shipping and the production of more Xarde comic books!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book has been funded and is 80% complete as the campaign begun. All Inks for all pages have been received, colors for 25% of the book are completed, and the first 6 pages have been lettered.  We expect the colors and lettering to be complete by the end of the campaign (August 4 or earlier).<br/>This leaves only the printing and fulfillment to be planned and executed in August for shipping targeted in September 2021.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can also greatly help the campaign by:</p>
<p>Sharing the Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and any other social media site you are a part of helps us ensure a successful campaign as more people hear about our project! </p>
<p>Tell friends, family, everyone you know and everybody you meet!</p>
<p>Like and repost our Instagram posts, like and share our Facebook posts and Indiegogo updates. We want to own the #dragon and #xarde hashtags, so use these hashtags liberally and help Xarde dominate social media!</p>

Xarde is a fantasy adventure comic book about a young, feckless woman living in the modern world who realizes she has innate, nascent dragon-like powers.  She inherits the Sword of the Dragon Warden and must come to terms with her thrice-cursed existence.
Xarde has been trapped in the modern world not realizing she is from another, medieval, world where Dragons and Devils are real.  She must overcome the challenge of her past while figuring out her place in the strange new reality she finds herself in.

This will ensure that Xarde's story can be told and the epic of her life can continue not only in these first 4 parts, but beyond as well.  Thank you very much for your interest in this project and I cannot wait to see Xarde come forth into the real world in her 24 page First Act!L. Dean Gibson II

Stretch Goals
When Xarde reaches its funding target, we have some stretch goals in mind for the community to reach for as the campaign goes on.Just Added:

Mike Krome Coaster Backer Goal Unlocked! 
Collectible Card Set Stretch Goal Unlocked!
Shikarii Bookmark Stretch Goal Unlocked!
Hedwin Zaldivar's ""The Trooper"" Metal Trading Card unlocked!
Xarde Logo Vinyl Sticker added at $5,000!


We have a beautiful Mike Krome illustration that we will use for Xarde #2 campaign. But while we wait for that, we have designed it into a coaster for a stretch goal on Xarde #1: The Dragoness!

Once we have the Mike Krome coaster in our rear view mirror, we'd like to make a set of collectible trade/sketch cards of the Xarde concept art! This idea will put 3x of a single design in every backer's mailer and then the gamification is on! Backers will need to find other backers to buy, sell, or trade from to fill in their collection and get a full set.  Show off your full set in the Sandig Renegade Fanatics Facebook Group!More stretch goals to come as the campign progresses through the targeted goals!

11x17 Prints
Take Xarde home with one of our 11x17 Art Print Bundles

Fine art Xarde pencils on giclée canvas print. 8x10 by Alina ZakarovaLimited to 50 Prints
From the author, Dean Gibson: ""This fine art pencil sketch was the first time Xarde felt 'real' to me. When I saw it I was stopped in my tracks and just stared at it. 'Well hello, Xarde' I would say to it. Half expecting an answer. The face shows the telltales of Xarde's dragon half, and betrays a kind of pensive mood in the asymmetric mouth that she may know of her troubled future. The quiet calm of the expression hints of her inner strength to deal with anything that may come.""2021 Xarde/Mercy Challenge Coin
We are thrilled to offer a 1.75"" Challenge coin to the campaign!  This beautiful, embossed, 3D silver plated coin commemorates the launch of Xarde #1: The Dragoness.Heads is Xarde and the latin phrase ""Vita Flammae"" or ""Life of Flame.""  This phrase reminds you to do what Xarde would do... ""Live on Fire!""Tails is Mercy, Xarde's nemesis with the latin phrase ""Memento Mori."" This stoic phrase reminds us all that death will one day come, reinforcing the need to ""Live on Fire"" today, and every day, because life is preciously short.

Xarde #1: The Dragoness is such a beautiful book that we thought the key, historical moments within the book should be extracted and honored with their own 6x9 mini prints!  The three scenes you'll get with this mini-print add-on are:

Xarde's flashback - pg 6 where Xarde starts to remember the epochs of her past unwinds back millennia.
Tiamat's Wrath - pg 7 where Tiamat commands the devil's mercenary, Mercy, to seek and destroy Ebora, Queen of the Red Dragon Flight and her mate, Xarde's father, the Dragon Warden.
Rex Dracos' last stand - pg 8 where Xarde's father battles Mercy in the doomed last stand of the Dragon Warden.



The Impact
The budget for pencils, inks, colors and letters for 24 interior comic book pages and multiple cover/splash images has already been financed and completed.
Your campaign dollars will go to printing, shipping and the production of more Xarde comic books!

Risks & Challenges
The book has been funded and is 80% complete as the campaign begun. All Inks for all pages have been received, colors for 25% of the book are completed, and the first 6 pages have been lettered.  We expect the colors and lettering to be complete by the end of the campaign (August 4 or earlier).This leaves only the printing and fulfillment to be planned and executed in August for shipping targeted in September 2021.

<p>This is a break-even campaign for us. In these uncertain times, the goal is to help sustain the artists Diabolik relies on, and to ensure more PDB adventures for everyone in the future. That's what our <strong>Double or Nothing </strong>stretch goal is all about - doubling your fun while doubling the rates for our artists! So much WIN you'll get sick of winning! (too soon?)</p>
<p>The coloring book is nearly finished, with only a handful of coloring pages and puzzles to go. As soon as it's done, it'll be printed at lightning speed in the USA (Montana to be exact), and ship out within weeks of the campaign ending. But don't worry - you won't have to wait until then to get your color on. Every contribution of $ 25 or more immediately gets a ten page PDF preview of pages to color! Print them out as many times as you like and color them a zillion different ways. There's no wrong way to kiss the sky, beautiful star-child! </p>

<p><strong>GROKEN</strong> is a graphic novel of more than forty-two full color pages in the genre of sci-fi and fantasy.  Within this graphic novel conspiracies are explored through the travels of this peculiar character named GROKEN.</p>
<p>This Odyssey is set in a rotten era where myths were sadly forgotten and science corrupted the hopes of a good tomorrow.  A singular theory makes the regiment shudder and the system now fears that the secret will be revealed and that the right to the crown will be claimed by the myth, a creature that bears the name of GROKEN.</p>

Created by Kenneth Rocafort also written, drawn and colored by himself.
 

 
GROKEN is a graphic novel of more than forty-two full color pages in the genre of sci-fi and fantasy.  Within this graphic novel conspiracies are explored through the travels of this peculiar character named GROKEN.
This Odyssey is set in a rotten era where myths were sadly forgotten and science corrupted the hopes of a good tomorrow.  A singular theory makes the regiment shudder and the system now fears that the secret will be revealed and that the right to the crown will be claimed by the myth, a creature that bears the name of GROKEN.
GROKEN.
Born as a beast and forge as a man.
 

 

GROKEN is a project by the creative mind of Kenneth Rocafort, who has worked on visual designs and illustrating stories together with writers such as: Paul Dini, Scott Lobdell, Jonathan Hickman, Al Elwin, Geoff Johns, Ron Marz, Mark Waid, Paul Cornell, Dan Abnett, Will Pfeifer, Andi Ewington, Nathan Edmondson, Charles Soule, Dave Wielgosz, C.B. Cebulski, Peter J. Tomasi and Dan DiDio... during his career in DC Comics, Marvel and Top Cow among other companies in the comic industry.
Now Kenneth Rocafort takes the reigns as a writer to expose this series and invites you to be part of this event in his career.

<p><i>The planet, Fej Farok, brother and sister Miriam e

through the veil that separates all parallel dimensions, and keeps

Today.</i><br/>Miriam and Kite are two lively kids, like many of their
age, divinding their time between school and friends. They’re
orphans. Miriam looks after her little brother, who’s not really
the easy kind, though. Miriam is a very nice young girl and careful
sister but at times she can be a little bit too harsh with herself
and the people around her. Kite is a real force of nature, lazy at
school and in everyday tasks and a real daredevil on the streets
while practicing his favorite hobby, Parkour: he’s a young, flashy
energy mix.<br/><span><span><span>At
the beginning of the story the two were worried about a strange
hallucination they shared: they saw themselves unmoving, hand in
hand, suspended into a mesmerized state, staring at a strange
geometric flame containing a bright light tearing off the strange
polygon from its center. Kite and Miriam have never given too much
credit to these visions, untill the day they got suddenly surrounded
by very menacing mysterious black creatures. Frightened to the bones,
they tried to run away, but they were dragged into a strange place:
the same they saw into those visions.<br/><br/>When they woke up, they
found themselves in the middle of a bloody battle between the Black
Creatures and a powerful warrior. Meanwhile, above them, a black
titan  materialized, destroying everything around him: the two
stunned kids were misteriously turned into two growling red
creatures; then saved and turned back into humans by a new charming
character named Lu-Ay. <br/><br/>At the end of a puzzling and upsetting
conversation with Lu-Ay, Miriam and Kite are unfortunately parted
from each other: while Miriam is taken by a Black Creature, Kite
stays behind, now alone, confused but very determined to find his
sister. He will face a long and hard journey, alongside extraordinary
creatures. His aim is to find Miriam and get out of the wide and
dazzling planet of Lumina, as the fearsome warrior Oleg and the
abyssal Nohea call it.</span><br/><br/>(<i>A

The book's genre is inbetween sci-fi and fantasy,
mainly inspired by Miyazaki, whose influence you'll certainly

and charismatic characters will be involved in one of the most

The plot unveils around the story of two children, Kite
and Miriam, brother and sister, who find themselves thrown in a
parallel world called Lumina.
This will be one of the first comic books in the world
to be colored with the hyperflat technique (link) and printed using hexachrome, a six-color printing process (link).
We decided to bring this project to life through the
crowdfunding community, as we believe that the straight connection
between the authors and the readers is the strongest factor during
the publishing process.
Plus, we are sure that the only way the comics world
can be brought to a higher level is through the support of its
ultimate investors - the readers.

they tried to run away, but they were dragged into a strange place:
the same they saw into those visions.When they woke up, they
found themselves in the middle of a bloody battle between the Black
Creatures and a powerful warrior. Meanwhile, above them, a black
titan  materialized, destroying everything around him: the two
stunned kids were misteriously turned into two growling red
creatures; then saved and turned back into humans by a new charming
character named Lu-Ay. At the end of a puzzling and upsetting
conversation with Lu-Ay, Miriam and Kite are unfortunately parted
from each other: while Miriam is taken by a Black Creature, Kite
stays behind, now alone, confused but very determined to find his
sister. He will face a long and hard journey, alongside extraordinary
creatures. His aim is to find Miriam and get out of the wide and
dazzling planet of Lumina, as the fearsome warrior Oleg and the
abyssal Nohea call it.(A
little spoiler) The first volume
ends on this panel...

Help us reach the goals!

This is what we need to print the book, but we do not want to stop here!
With the previous campaign we were able to record the Lumina soundtrack and now our goal is to have enough funds to create the new soundtrack by Remo Baldi.Moreover we would like to publish two spin-off called ""World of Lumina"" dedicated to Oleg and Kite and drawn by two young Italian artists under the supervision of Emanuele and Linda.
If we reach the stretch goals all the contributors will receive the soundtrack and the spinoff for free.

Frequently Asked Questions

You can buy the first volume here or just contact us. We will send you the first volume together with second one to reduce the shipping costs.

We'll make sure your patience will be rewarded with a nice surprise in your pack.


In what language is Lumina printed? 
For this campaign all the materials will be available in Italian or English.We will contact you when the book will be ready to select your preferred language.

<li>
<strong>Marius Longinus</strong>, a Roman centurion working under the provisional governor of Jerusalem. He’s our main character.

<li>
<strong>Aeliana Romilius</strong>, the daughter of a general and a member of a powerful patrician family back in Rome. She’s been sheltered a lot, but she’s also seen the corruption of Rome up close in ways Marius hasn’t. She and Marius go back a long way. </li>
<li>
<strong>Nasrin of Parthia</strong>. She’s a visiting Princess from the Parthian Empire (now modern day Iran) who’s been sent to Jerusalem. She’s proud, headstrong, and knows much more than she’s telling. </li>
<li>
<strong>Khabash of Meroe</strong>. He’s a former gladiator from North Africa who turned to banditry after he gained his freedom. He hates Rome with a burning passion for what was done to him. </li>
<li>
<strong>Raanan</strong>, a petty thief living off the streets in Jerusalem. Mostly enjoys stealing from the Romans, and he eventually falls in with the wrong crowd. </li>
<li>
<strong>Rivka</strong>, Raanan’s sister and a local healer. She’s the one member of the team who’s a true believer in what they’re doing. </li>
<li>
<strong>Cyrus of Alexandria</strong>, a Greek merchant and a former sailor. When we meet him, he seems more interested in looking out for himself and getting ahead… but is there more to him than that? </li>
</ul><p>All these people come from very different backgrounds, walks of life, and they have very different views of the world. They’d probably never meet if it was up to them, much less work together. But they have to become a team if they’re going to fix the damage they’ve done to time. Worse, they face eternal damnation if they fail. The first issue sets all this up and tells the story of how they first meet.

<h2>The Pitch</h2>
<p>The Plot Holes are a squad of fictional warriors who transport themselves into the pages of other books, using their unique skills to save the plots in order to stop them from being destroyed. And Cliff is their newest recruit, a comic creator who's just realized his world isn't real—in fact, it's a complete fiction that literally exists inside a novel. The other members are misfits like him, pulled from unpublished books that couldn't be saved: a manga samurai, a barbarian tiger, a kid from a comic strip, and a vampire assassin. Outclassed by the other members, Cliff sets out to prove his worth to The Plot Holes as they fight to save as many books as possible. The only thing stopping them is Surge, an ex-member who's gone rogue—not only is he threatening to destroy the digital matrix containing them, he threatens to destroy the database of digital libraries all over the world!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What makes this different?</h3>
<p>On its surface, The Plot Holes is an adventure story that treks through dozens of different genres with a wide range of characters, offering something for every kind of reader. But on a deeper level, The Plot Holes asks meta-textual questions like no comic ever has: if Cliff knows he's not real, then why does he want to survive? Is the team really “alive” if they only exist in our imaginations? And what happens to them if they die?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Still not convinced?</h3>
<p>This comic takes Philip K. Dick, gives him a blaster, and shoves him into an adventure he's not ready for!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who the heck is Sean Murphy?</h3>
<p>I am the writer/artist of the blockbuster comic BATMAN: White Knight and it's sequel BATMAN: Curse of the White Knight from DC Comics. I've also worked on tons of independent titles like Chrononauts (being adapted at Netflix) and Tokyo Ghost (may be adapted at some point, but I'm not sure if I can talk about it). I've also worked on titles like Hellblazer, Star Trek, Star Wars, The Wake, and created the cult classic Punk Rock Jesus. You might have seen my work in print with me listed as Sean Gordon Murphy. That's me!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Yeah...but can I trust you to finish this project? How do I know you won't just steal my money, jerk?</h3>
<p>Believe me, I got this! I'm a professional who's been doing this for 17 years, and I work hard so I don't let any of my readers down (and I don't need my 70k twitter followers attacking me for dropping the ball).

Yeah, coronavirus has thrown a wrench into the system, but we've tracked down printers and distributors who are ready to get to work! Sure, there might be logistical delays, but rest assured Sean and his team will bust their ass, work late hours, and find workarounds if they're needed. We set a generous deadline and we plan on sticking to it.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to backing the campaign, please share a link to the campaign on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or whatever social media platforms you use! You can even use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>The more backers and funding we get, the more special the final product will be (more art, more extras, better printing quality, more types of books, etc).</p>

Yeah, coronavirus has thrown a wrench into the system, but we've tracked down printers and distributors who are ready to get to work! Sure, there might be logistical delays, but rest assured Sean and his team will bust their ass, work late hours, and find workarounds if they're needed. We set a generous deadline and we plan on sticking to it.

I've worked for Heroes of the North the comic,  a award winning web-series of Canadian Superheroes.  BLOODHUNT is My latest book and My first Indiegogo project, fully completed and fulfilled &amp; I've colors for CYBERSHOCK, Pages &amp; Design of Vaine from THE LOST PAGES bonus book, Pages from OUTLAW NIGHTS, plus many covers, Prints, sketch Cards for many campaigns. </p><p>HUGE fan of S.Bisley, F.Miller, M.Silvertri, Jim Lee, G.Capullo, Dale Keown, Arthur Adams, Mike Mignola.

This 20 page collection contains four stories: Charlie Finds a Friend, There's Nothing to Be Scared Of, Don't Open the Box, and A Knife in Darkness. This comic will terrify even the most seasoned horror fans.    In Charlie Finds a Friend, a lonely boy becomes friends with a voice in his radio and uncovers an old secret.In There's Nothing to Be Scared Of, Vicky confronts her biggest fears--but they just might get her first.In Don't Open the Box, a man is gifted a small wooden box by his wife, and is instructed not to open it. But when odd things keep occurring, the urge to open it grows stronger.And in A Knife in Darkness, sometimes horror stories do have happy endings. They thought it was dead and buried for good……but it.. came… back!!!Everything had stopped dead save for the beating of his heart. The dense black horizon was jagged with trees and hills. Clouds passed over the face of the moon, and Jason was eclipsed in raven darkness. His hands gripped the shovel tight, then he began to dig.The coins, he thought, they’re buried here—they must be!His hands were slick with sweat; he was nervous, but the reward buried in the stony soil would be worth it. The collection of silver coins.Close, Jason thought, I’m so close.But he did not find the legendary pieces of silver—what he found was much worse!The zombie’s eyes dangled from its sockets and its coarse tongue limped between its lips. The hideous being reached for Jason; Jason lifted the shovel and brought it down on the creature’s head repeatedly until it fell back into the grave.With his dying breath, the zombie said, “Jason,” then lifted a paper, “will you draw my comic?”If this funds well we have the potential to make this an ongoing book.Every tier except the lowest tier and digital tier come with a trading card.With your help, Nasser Rabadi, Shawn Langley, and Joey Turnage were able to produce the HIT indiegogo comics STARDUST and TRIXIE CAIN: BLOOD REAPER. Now, Nasser and artist/collaborator Jason Robinson are ready to launch SECRET COMICS PRESENTS, a horror anthology with the potential to expand into a series IF we have your support.Our initial goal is to cover production costs of paying Jason for his time, printing the book, having it shipped to me, then shipping it to our wonderful backers. We each have a track record of completing projects, so we WILL deliver the book on time. IF anything does arise that delays the shipping of the book, we will be transparent the entire time with weekly updates on progress.We pride ourselves in acting professionally and delivering, so you can rest assured that you'll get what you pay for.If at any time you have a question about the project, my email is NasserRabadi13@yahoo.com, and my Twitter DMs are always open, @NasserRabadi13We have several pages drawn, and Jason is livestreaming the creation of future pages several times a week.STRETCH GOALS!$10,000: The book is extended an extra 4 pages of behind the scenes extras to bring it to 24 total.$15,000: Jason will paint the cover.$20,000: Every backer gets a SECRET COMICS 2x2 patch.$30,000: Nasser shaves his head.If you'd like to support us outside of the campaign, you can support Nasser here:Books: https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author...YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuSaSkq8R3_0o3...Twitter: https://twitter.com/nasserrabadi13Newsletter: https://mailchi.mp/3b31e29016d9/nasserPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/NasserRabadi13And Jason here: YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/IllustrationByDesignFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/IllustrationByDesign/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/robinzson13/Personal website: www.illustration-by-design.comPREVIOUS WORKS/ABOUT THE CREATORSJason Robinson has been an illustrator since the 1990s, working on a Spawn comic for Todd McFarlane, and working on covers and designs for several other companies.

<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p>In the wake of a catastrophic event that has left the planet in shambles and decimated the hero community, the survivors now work towards putting the world back together. As Earth still licks its wounds from its greatest threat to date, there are those who would take advantage of this situation for power and gain. New heroes must rise in order to give the people hope, and one girl has the power to be the beacon. Will she continue to walk away from her destiny?</p>

In the wake of a catastrophic event that has left the planet in shambles and decimated the hero community, the survivors now work towards putting the world back together. As Earth still licks its wounds from its greatest threat to date, there are those who would take advantage of this situation for power and gain. New heroes must rise in order to give the people hope, and one girl has the power to be the beacon. Will she continue to walk away from her destiny?

<h3><u><strong>THE STORY</strong></u></h3>
<p>“My mother was a witch, she was burned alive.”</p>
<p>Whether it’s Metallica’s iconic cover, or Diamond Head’s groundbreaking original, “Am I Evil?” is the perfect Heavy Metal song, a thrilling 8-minute journey into a world of violence, bloodshed, dark magic, beauty, and vengeance.</p>
<p>“Am I Evil? The Graphic Novel” takes us deep into the story of the lyrics, from the fiery execution of the young avenger’s mother, on through his madness, his training, his connection to the mysterious “sweet and timely whore,” and ultimately, his bloody quest for retribution. Join us in visualizing this story that’s been performed on the largest stages in the world. </p>

<p>How does Vandr carry out his revenge? Who are the twenty-seven who killed his mother? Was she really a witch? Find the meaning of the “bodies on the ice” and the “sweet and timely whore” in the pages of the “Am I Evil?” Graphic Novel.</p>

<p>We’ve streamlined our budget for this one, but added several reward tiers and backer options. The IndieGoGo campaign is not ""all-or-nothing,"" so there will be a guaranteed project foundation when it completes. The more we raise, we more ""Am I Evil?"" you get! Our most ambitious outline tells the story in 6 chapters/issues, but we can do it in 1, if we have to. <strong>You will get the complete one-shot story.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll start with a digital hybrid prose/comic story, but stretch goals will include print and audio versions. That’s right - - new podcast fiction from Jack Mangan! (stretch goals listed below)</p>
