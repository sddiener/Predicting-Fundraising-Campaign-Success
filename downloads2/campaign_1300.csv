<h3>Why The Five Minute Dream?</h3>
<p>There are moments in time when we could all use a little encouragement. Whether it's been a tough day, a tough week or a tough year!</p>
<p>Maybe you just landed your biggest client yet and now you're about to hit the panic button because you don't know how you're going to get the job done!</p>
<p>Maybe you've lost sight of what it is you REALLY want? Or are you just too busy to stop and think about things? Is everything piling in on top of you or someone you know?</p>
<p>My mum gave me a card years ago that said 'Follow Your Dreams'. That card has lived on the pin board in my office and I've looked at it every day for over ten years.</p>
<p>I'm launching The Five Minute Dream to encourage people to just reflect for a few minutes each day on what their dreams are, what they really want, and to help them stay inspired and work towards it.</p>
<p>I thought greeting cards and bookmarks were a great place to start. They are nice to use yourself, or give as gifts, send to a loved one, a client, final year students, everyone with a dream, inspiration or aspiration!</p>
<p>I've added some images below of some of the artwork (not all!) There are seven sayings, and each saying is available across all designs, so 42 designs in all.</p>
<p>Retail pricing will be as follows:</p>
<p>Cards $5.95<br/>Bookmarks $2.95<br/>12"" x 12"" Printed Canvas $34.95<br/>Coffee mugs, tote bags and journals to follow next!</p>
<p>Of course, wholesale pricing for businesses will also be available.</p>
<h3>The Nitty Gritty!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I'm raising funds to get my first print run done of greeting cards and bookmarks. The funding is for printing the cards, getting envelopes, and plastic sleeves to put them in.</p>
<p>Regardless of the amount I raise, it will all be going towards the first print run. The amount of funding will determine the size of the run. It will cover sample stock, stock to fulfill any orders placed here, plus some stock to start fulfilling orders.</p>
<p>In other words, it will get me up and running!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>People need inspiration and dreams. We all need to look ahead and keep ourselves moving forward. What better gift to give than something people can look at every day to help them remember their dreams, to help keep them inspired, to help them keep moving forward? A message to tell them that they CAN do whatever it is they think they can? A message to encourage them through tough times?</p>
</div><div><h3>And Please...</h3></div><div>
<p>I would really appreciate your help getting the word out!</p>
<p>Please use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word to help get the world inspired again!</p>

There might be a few big ideas in it, but primarily the book is for entertainment. In case you don't know me, I'm a TV writer, having written for some great shows like '<b>MadTV</b>', '<b>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</b>', '<b>Corner Gas</b>' and '<b>That's So Weird</b>'. My biggest deal was likely co-creating the sketch/sitcom hybrid TV show <b>Sunnyside</b>, with Dan Redican. I've also worked as an actor, a director and an animator. This is my third novel, the others, '<b>Slapshot of Love</b>' and '<b>Me and the Crack Mayor</b>' were also self published. You can get them at Amazon all over the world. </p>
<p>Do you like awards? I've won some and been nominated for a bunch more. They are very shiny, and I enjoyed winning them, but I've found they don't convert to cash the way I'd like.  </p>
<p>Here's a good question... Why don't I just get a publisher? ...the answer is...I tried and found no interest. Damn! I have lots of rejection letters which I keep for inspiration. I've read that J.K Rowling and Stephen King have kept all their rejections. So, we have that much in common. However, the cool thing about today's culture, whether it's Youtube or Funny or Die or self publishing, the old gate keepers can't keep you from making your art. You can do it yourself. In this case, I'll be doing it myself, with some help, hopefully from you! </p>
<p>What about government or arts grants? No luck there, either. To be honest, I don't think I write the kind of thing that gets grants. It's just too dumb.<br/></p>
<p> So this campaign takes this book, which right now is just a bunch of words and drawings on my hard drive and makes it into an actual book which you'll be able read in paperback or digital version. It will be sold all around the world on Amazon.  </p>
<p>What is the dream? That people read and enjoy the book. Beyond that, there is the knowledge that 50 Shades of Grey and The Martian both started as self published books. It is highly unlikely that my book would have a lightning strike like those two, but I might as well dream big, right? </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need The Money For...</h3>
<div>Five thousand bucks is a lot of money. So what will it be used for? Let me tell you where the expenses come in. Maybe you want to self publish your own book- here's what you're up against. </div>
<div>1. You need an editor and you need to pay that editor. I had an excellent one, Carly Jones. She is not getting anywhere near what she deserves for her work. </div>
<div>2. The cover design needs to look good and professional. Jodi Boyer did that for me and I love her stuff. Again, Jodi is underpaid. </div>
<div>3. The original file that I wrote the book in...good old Microsoft Word...has to be converted for both the Kindle edition and a print version. This costs money from an outside company. Hard cash comes in here as there are no friendly favours from those guys. </div>
<div>4. While I have a front cover, Amazon does the back cover and spine. This is another hard cost I can't get around.</div>
<div>5. Publicity. I need to tell the world the book is out. That will cost some money.  </div>
<div>6. Pay for writing. No, I will not be paid for writing the book through this fundraiser. I only make money if anyone buys the book once it is out. The novel will be priced around five dollars for a digital version, and around sixteen dollars for the paperback. In either case, on each sale, I'll pocket three or four dollars before expenses. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What your money really does</h3>
<div>It encourages me to keep writing! It tells me my work has some value. If you do contribute, you'll be small part of literature history. Okay, tiny part. Minuscule. Barely noticeable, but it will mean a lot to me.  </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other things you could do with your money</h3> <p>Oh, so many things, really. Food. Shelter. Fun. You could give to charities that could save the world. You could buy yourself something you always wanted. You could purchase some great gift for a loved one. Now I'm really regretting including this part. I have no idea why I put this in. It's totally counter productive to what I'm trying to do here. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Money is tight. I get it. I know a lot of actors, writers, directors and other artists who have a similar up and down trajectory to their careers as I do. And if you read the paragraph above, you know there are a lot of uses for whatever money you have. You can still help me by spreading this page to your friends through Facebook and Twitter. Use the Indiegogo share tools. That would be really nice of you. And just tell people about it in person out in the Real-O-Sphere. </p>
<p>The other thing I'd like, if you're low on cash, is if, when the book comes out in a couple of months, you buy one. I promise I will keep the digital copy about the same as a Starbucks coffee and not even as much as the fancy ones. It's going to be about five bucks for digital, about sixteen for paperback.  And if you like the book, you can post a review on Amazon or bookish websites. And if you don't like the book, you can help me by not telling anyone about it. </p>

To inspire, help and give direction to African creatives and talents.  We plan on hosting an exhibition in all aspects of Africa (North, East, West, Central and Southern Africa) with photography from African Lens publication. We begin with phase one in Cape Town, South Africa in December 2016, then Morocco (North Africa) Ghana, (West Africa) and finally Kenya (East Africa).Besides exhibitions, we will have talk sessions to connect and interact with the people. Our aim is to be hands on with the people, share ideas and knowledge, learn from each other, inspire and empower each other. In every country we visit, we will work on original editorial projects that will put a spotlight and attention on important and untapped aspects of Africa. We will collaborate with the native photographers, document the experience and build more material for future publications. As photographers and creatives, we believe in the power of visual storytelling thus, using photography as a voice and platform to tell a true, diverse and balanced story of the motherland.COUNTRIES WE WILL EXHIBIT (PHASE 1) :South AfricaGhanaMoroccoKenya Select PhotographersTJ Letsa - Ghana Fundiswa Ntoyi- South Africa Zakaria Wakrim - MoroccoYannis - Gabon Hisaham A.

<p>La Factrie, c’est un mélange du patrimoine culturel de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield et de l’histoire de l’art. En effet, le nom fait référence à la fameuse Factory d’Andy Warhol (on parle ici du côté effervescent du fameux lieu culte !) qui a permis à des centaines d’artistes de tous les styles d’arts de s’émanciper. De plus, le mot Factrie était très utilisé dans les années 60 pour faire référence aux manufactures, telles que notre fameuse Montreal Cotton. </p>
<p>Le projet est né à la suite d’une étude de marché sous forme d'entrevues et de sondages qui ont été menés auprès de 150 personnes de la communauté. Cette initiative est née sous l’impulsion d’un comité d’orientation composé, entre autres, de représentants du Café Agora, du Collège de Valleyfield et de la Ville de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. Les 25 et 26 septembre 2015 a eu lieu la première fin de semaine d'activités. Elle a permis de valider l’intérêt des Campivallensiens en vue de l'implantation permanente d'un café culturel au centre-ville de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield. Ce sont Cyndi Trudel et Émilie Fortier, deux anciennes du Collège de Valleyfield, qui travaillent d'arrache-pied depuis maintenant près d'un an pour faire naître ce beau projet!</p>

<p><strong>La programmation </strong></p>
<p>Ce ne sera pas des shows, mais des événements! Des bibittes qu’on aime voir, entendre, goûter… Des bibittes idéalement conçues dans le Suroît, pas parce qu’on est né pour un petit pain, mais parce qu’on est fier de notre coin de pays. On souhaite aussi que les activités pour la famille soient au cœur de la programmation et qu’en soirée cette atmosphère familiale laisse place à une ambiance plus festive. Pour le reste, on est à la recherche de propositions qui sortent des sentiers battus et qui contribueront à créer une expérience mémorable chez les gens qui viendront fréquenter le café.</p>

<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<p>Notre objectif est de recueillir la somme de 15 000 $. Nous avons à l'heure actuelle réussi à récolter 40 000 des 65 000 $ nécessaires à l'ouverture d'un café ayant pignon sur rue au centre-ville de Salaberry-de-Valleyfield.

<h2><strong>Risques et défis</strong></h2>
<p>À la lumière du verdict de la communauté, il a été possible de conclure qu’il y a un besoin dans la communauté pour un café culturel faisant office de lieu culturel multidisciplinaire convivial, abordable et vivant. Toutefois, l'offre en matière de culture et de restauration reste à Salaberry-de-Valleyfield somme toute importante. Il sera important de ne pas diluer l'offre culturelle. La Fatrie ne veut pas devenir une concurrente pour les acteurs déjà en place, mais bien une offre complémentaire qui attire une nouvelle clientèle. Elle devra s'appuyer sur les efforts d’un maximum d’acteurs travaillant en concertation. Dans tous les cas, il paraît essentiel que l’une des missions de La Factrie soit le développement de public culturel et la création de synergies entre l’ensemble des organismes culturels sur le territoire de la ville. La mise en place de ce lieu doit se faire de manière à impliquer le plus possible ses futurs utilisateurs pour créer dès le départ un sentiment fort pour l’institution et contribuer à créer un café leur ressemblant.</p>
<p>Pour minimiser les coûts d’exploitation du café culturel, il est clair que l’engagement bénévole de plusieurs utilisateurs du café sera nécessaire au sein du conseil d’administration, de comités de programmation et pour l’accomplissement de tâches courantes simples à effectuer.</p>
<p>Le fait de se baser sur le bénévolat est une formule gagnante qui a fait ses preuves à plusieurs reprises dans d’autres cafés culturels à travers le Québec. Cependant, on peut noter dans la région une baisse de l'implication bénévole au cours des dernières années, ainsi qu'un épuisement des bénévoles eux-mêmes. Il sera primordial de développer un sentiment d’appartenance des utilisateurs envers leur café culturel. Ce qui a déjà été solidement enclenché au cours des 2 dernières années, notamment avec les rencontres individuelles qui ont eu lieu lors de l'étude de marché. Aussi, la première fin de semaine d'activité a déjà permis aux organisateurs de créer un bassin de personne impliquée qui a à coeur le projet. Finalement, plusieurs organismes sont vivement actifs au sein du projet dont le Café Agora qui a déjà offert une somme de 15 000$ pour mener à terme ce projet. L’idée sera également de faire en sorte que le café reste connecté sur les besoins de la population campivallensienne en étant un lieu pour et par les citoyens.</p>

<h3>For the last 12 years I have been working on creating a life-size version of the iconic TIME MACHINE </h3>
<div>I first saw the movie, The Time Machine,  when I was 7 years old and it inspired me  to follow a career in film making. I started making 8mm films at the age of 9 and went on to work in nearly every field of film and video production from writing, producing, directing to cinematography  and  stop-motion animation. </div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I began construction of a replica of The Time Machine in 2003 thinking it would be a  3-month project. But as I made parts for the model I became interested in the artisan crafts necessary to produce each piece faithfully.  I decided to make my Machine with ""noble"" materials such as brass, marble, mahogany, ceramics, etc.. This required that I learn such craft disciplines as metal spinning , stone turning, woodworking, mold making and more. That 3-month project is now in its 12th year. </span></div>
<div>
<p>My Time Machine is, at last, ready to unveil. The event will be filmed as part of an upcoming documentary exploring the obsession with time travel.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here is the trailer for the film...</span></p>

I started making 8mm films at the age of 9 and went on to work in nearly every field of film and video production from writing, producing, directing to cinematography  and  stop-motion animation. 
I began construction of a replica of The Time Machine in 2003 thinking it would be a  3-month project. But as I made parts for the model I became interested in the artisan crafts necessary to produce each piece faithfully.  I decided to make my Machine with ""noble"" materials such as brass, marble, mahogany, ceramics, etc.. This required that I learn such craft disciplines as metal spinning , stone turning, woodworking, mold making and more. That 3-month project is now in its 12th year. 

My Time Machine is, at last, ready to unveil. The event will be filmed as part of an upcoming documentary exploring the obsession with time travel.Here is the trailer for the film...




Recently, I have been creating unique lighting fixtures using vintage items. This is a Zoetrope made with a cast iron lamp and parts from an antique hand drill...


Many of the ""perks"" offered, are my hand made objects.
For $100 

36"" X 24"" Poster Of The Time Machine

36""x 24"" print of Chris Perrotta's black and white Time Machine drawings. These drawings represent a dimensionally accurate version of the M.G.M. movie prop and have been use to produce scale model recreations. See the photo below.




For $250 
Resin Casting of Brass Flourish (numbered and signed) 
One of the decorative elements on the Time Machine which makes it the ornate Victorian beauty it is. I have had the privilege of visiting and studying the original Machine in the  Los Angeles ""museum"" owned by Bob Burns. You receive a resin casting from my original mold mounted on a wooden base. Its signed and numbered. Watch the video below to see where on the Time Machine this part is located.

One Of A Kind 

Vintage Iconic Flat Iron Table Light
While traveling through time, I found this classic flat iron from the 1950's. I could not resist shining some new light on this vintage iconic object. I also created the base to resemble a vintage ironing board complete with muslin fabric. This is a one of a kind piece. 


For $285
Figurative Bookend 
Cast from the 1898 antique Berninghaus Barber Chair used in the Time Machine. Faux finished and mounted on oak.  Watch the video below to see its location on the Machine.

Vintage Oil Can - Flashlight Lamp

Two iconic objects from the passed get joined and function as a very cool lighting fixture. Great as a desk lamp or to spotlight a photo or painting on a wall. These are all hand made and vary a bit in color.





For $350 
20"" Tall Vintage Oil Can - Flashlight Lamp
The on/off switch is the oil pump lever!

For $480 
1948 Polaroid Camera Light
In 1948  Polaroid introduced the Land Camera, which produced prints in about 1 minute. I have taken this classic instant film camera and transformed it into a beautiful one of-a-kind lighting fixture. There are TWO lights. Both the lens and the flash unit can be lit together or separately. The on/off switch for the lens light is the actual shutter release button. The Camera sits on an all metal vintage tripod with extending legs so it can be used as a table lamp or a floor lamp! 



For $600
The Time Machine Crystal Control Lever
This beauty was hand crafted by Hollywood prop builder, Don Coleman. For many years, Don has been creating wonderful art for major productions  including StarTrek. Its constructed using solid brass. The  crystal, the source of the Machine's power, is 30%+ lead crystal.The handle is a urethane casting meticulously painted to resemble green marble.",13.0,4,"1 Campaign

I made my gallery debut as a painter in 2014 at Alexander Salazar Fine Art in San Diego, CA. (<a href=""http://alexandersalazarfineart.com/artists/adam-disbrow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://alexandersalazarfineart.com/artists/adam...</a>) Since my debut I have been invited to different venues to exhibit and sell my work such as the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, MD, and Javits Center in New York City, NY. I have experienced great support and appreciation from collectors and appreciators throughout the country and the world. Most recently, I won the Tom Tom Founder Festival Lamppost Banner Competition, winning a lamppost display on the outdoor walking mall of Charlottesville, VA.</p>
<p>My devotion is to the Arts and enhancing the world culture. I was blessed to have a private investor in the year of 2014. With his help I was able to obtain the supplies I needed to frame 14 large works and drive them from Virginia to California (I framed the works and transported them myself in July of 2014). The opening night of the exhibition was July 25th, 2014. I had the honor of sharing the opening with international phenom-Clive Barker. It was a lot of work but with the support of friends and family I met the deadline, and the dream became a reality. </p>
<p>My investor's support ended December 31st, 2014. He helped me get off the ground and I am supremely grateful to him. I have received extremely positive feedback on my work from collectors in many demographics, selling over $5,000 in artwork last year. However, without your help, maintaining my current momentum will not be manageable. Please help me continue creating art that, I hope, the entire world will appreciate for centuries to come. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The money raised in this campaign will go to studio space, art supplies (canvas, paint, and brushes), gas to get to and from my studio (it is 50 miles from my home), wood to build frames (as aforementioned I build my own - wood shop also 50 miles from my home). If I make the goal, I will  also purchase a new GoPro camera to create another time-lapse video like the one featured above. I no longer have the use of the camera we used to film the above video. With your help, we will make art history.<br/></p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you will be actively enhancing the culture of the world, you will be playing a role in art history, and you will be supporting the passion of a soul devoted to the arts. ... But that is not all...</p>
<p>If you donate to this campaign I will send you a signed print of original art. Also, all contributors will receive a Special Thanks credit on future time-lapse videos (if we reach our goal). </p>
<p>Whatever funds I receive from this campaign, be it the goal or far from it, will directly go into creating art! </p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>I understand that not everybody can contribute money. Please, take a moment to share this with your friends and family using the share tools provided. Art and culture are what make life unique and beautiful! Thank you for your time, support, and above all your appreciation of the arts.</div> <p>Sincerely,</p>

However, without your help, maintaining my current momentum will not be manageable. Please help me continue creating art that, I hope, the entire world will appreciate for centuries to come. 
   What I Need & What You Get The money raised in this campaign will go to studio space, art supplies (canvas, paint, and brushes), gas to get to and from my studio (it is 50 miles from my home), wood to build frames (as aforementioned I build my own - wood shop also 50 miles from my home). If I make the goal, I will  also purchase a new GoPro camera to create another time-lapse video like the one featured above. I no longer have the use of the camera we used to film the above video. With your help, we will make art history.
By supporting this campaign you will be actively enhancing the culture of the world, you will be playing a role in art history, and you will be supporting the passion of a soul devoted to the arts. ... But that is not all...
If you donate to this campaign I will send you a signed print of original art. Also, all contributors will receive a Special Thanks credit on future time-lapse videos (if we reach our goal). 
Whatever funds I receive from this campaign, be it the goal or far from it, will directly go into creating art! 
    

    Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everybody can contribute money. Please, take a moment to share this with your friends and family using the share tools provided. Art and culture are what make life unique and beautiful! Thank you for your time, support, and above all your appreciation of the arts. Sincerely,
Adam 'AD' Disbrow

Macon arts community was along the lines of, <i>“I wish there was a place where I
could just hang out and work on my projects and meet more of the other artists
around here.”</i>  Most people don’t have
easy access to the space or environment where they can work on their
craft.  Our homes are crowded and full of
the distractions of obligation and habitual living.  Once we’re out of college, where can we go for
daily studio access or an environment where script read-throughs and music
composition are welcome instead of out-of-place?
</p><p>Monthly meetings of art clubs are definitely helpful for
maintaining some focus and connecting with fellow artists and crafters, but
they do not meet often enough or long enough for the advancement of serious
projects.  Not all media are supported by
local clubs, either.  What if we had a
club for everyone?  What if that club was
open six days a week and for 10-12 hours each day?  What if you had the space to work
comfortably, enjoy refreshments and build an arts community?  </p>

and network?  What about a place where we
can go for workshops and collaboration?  What

at a space for our retail store, we kept coming back to the constant questions
about community and opportunity.  </p>
<p>We decided a few months ago that we would shift our
efforts from a small network of artists to a home for all artists.  The plan changed from a small storefront, to
a 5000 sq. ft. space on the corner of 5<sup>th</sup> and Poplar.  Our dream has always been to approach the art
market as a collaborative and invest what we can in the overall community.  Our 5-year plan started with visual arts,

the start-up support we need for the guild members and the full diversity of
arts media.  The success of this project
will be helped tremendously by not having to wait on a year’s capital savings,
in order to finally get the better equipment. 
We need a much larger pool of micro-grant funds, to support a wide

doing a membership drive, to help start out of the gate with a level of

<p><b>Beyond the
Known Territory</b></p>
<p>I've long
been fascinated by the unconscious and how it appears in art. Years ago while I
was living in the island city of Alameda CA, a mysterious figure started
appearing in my paintings. Then one day on the way to work, in a flash, words
came to me connected with that figure. It was the beginning of an ongoing
graphic narrative: Indigo Animal. </p>
<p>The strips
piled up and became one book, then a second—both self-published. The first
spent some time on the San Francisco Bay Area Best Seller list. From the
beginning, <i>Indigo Animal</i> has also serialized in the arts
journal <i>works &amp; conversations</i>. And now, after a journey of
over 20 years, I’m publishing the complete story from its beginning to its
concluding third book.</p>
<p><i>Indigo
Animal: The Complete Trilogy </i>is a book
difficult to categorize. Is it a graphic novel? Is it a book for children? Is
it a book for Jungian psychotherapists? Is it a book for artists who struggle
with the contemporary art world and its reliance on spectacle and conceptual
conceits? Yes, it’s all of that. But none of those categories really capture
its essence. </p>
<p><b>Why Support Us</b></p>
<p>I hope my project will inspire people to find and follow their own “inner
animals.” It’s a kind of alchemical process. The unfolding of
Indigo Animal's passionate pursuit of self-knowledge (and lawn statuary) has
been a life-enhancing journey. Sharing the story is a new step along the way.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>Having Indigo Animal's entire story under one cover has long been our dream. It’s now a reality and ready to send out. With this campaign we're hoping
to share indigo Animal's message with more people and get help covering some of
the costs. The book is beautiful—full color, 320-pages, hardcover. We're also
working to arrange events and related workshops. Please check

<h3>The Research</h3>
<p>At this time we have over 250+ images, two dozen brochures, letters and advertising materials and over 50 hours of taped interviews with past guests, employees and friends of the owners. The scanning, transcribing and conversions are almost complete.</p>
<p>We'd like to travel to the Poconos to visit the county archives and interview more people that are in the area and have more to share. 10% of the campaign funding goal is to make those arrangements and cover the cost for the final research for the book.</p>

<p>Printing a book is a costly venture, especially when the book is full color, on heavy paper and bound in a hard cover. 90% of the campaign funds we are seeking is to do a 1,500 book print run of the book.</p>

Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge is a fascinating look at the history of America’s favorite vacation spot in the Poconos.
The book is illustrated with hundreds of full color photographs, archival brochures, and historic news clippings. It features exclusive information collected from interviews with past guests and employees and full color photographs of the historic Mount Airy Lodge.
Mount Airy Lodge promised a dazzling, fun-filled vacation with outstanding nonstop entertainment. ''All you need to bring is your love for everything,'' went the voice-over, ending with the mellifluous ''Your Host With the Most in the Poconos. Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.''
Why We Want To Make This Book
We want to create this book to capture the fascinating history of the Mount Airy Lodge and to celebrate it’s many years as America’s premier honeymoon resort. 

As it changed and grew over the years, people marvelled at Czech born owner and hostess, Suzanne Martens, who transformed the little eight-room inn into the Poconos' largest resort which comprised several resorts sprawling over thousands of acres.

Many will remember the dining filled with epicurean delights and entertainment which included names such as Bob Hope, Milton Berle, Rodney Dangerfield, Tony Bennett, Alan King, Connie Francis, Nipsey Russell, Vic Damone, Joey Bishop, Phyllis Diller, Pat Boone,Lionel Hampton, Eddie Fisher, Wayne Newton, Vikki Carr, Red Skelton, and Don Rickles.
Parties were hosted for the who's who at the time - Wayne Newton, Rudy Vallee and Frank Sinatra Jr. just to name a few.

The Mount Airy Lodge also sponsored many Czech and Slovak immigrants. Our grandparents and mother were among the Czechs that arrived to live and work at the Mount Airy Lodge and owner/host Emil Wagner received several medals for his humanitarian efforts.

Few people know how Mount Airy Lodge began and what an impossible undertaking such a project would be today.

""In its heyday in the 1960's and 70's, Mount Airy Lodge, only a 90-minute drive from Manhattan, was unofficially known as the gentile version of the Catskills' Concord Hotel, a place that featured polka festivals, all-Irish weekends and all-you-can-eat smorgasbords.""
-Andrew Jacobs
The Story that Needs To Be Told

Not just for the nostalgic value but for all of the following:

Advertising and Marketing to make it the #1 honeymoon resort in its heyday.
A lesson in hard work, vision and the entrepreneurial spirit.
What lessons can be learned from a rise and decline, and changing times.


The Research
At this time we have over 250+ images, two dozen brochures, letters and advertising materials and over 50 hours of taped interviews with past guests, employees and friends of the owners. The scanning, transcribing and conversions are almost complete.
We'd like to travel to the Poconos to visit the county archives and interview more people that are in the area and have more to share. 10% of the campaign funding goal is to make those arrangements and cover the cost for the final research for the book.


The Printing
Printing a book is a costly venture, especially when the book is full color, on heavy paper and bound in a hard cover. 90% of the campaign funds we are seeking is to do a 1,500 book print run of the book.
The Perks & Rewards
We've created perks and rewards (to the right) where you can be a part of the story! No matter what your budget, we're sure you can contribute and you may even be in the book! 

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

Ask folks to get the word out.
Make some noise about our campaign.
Use the convenient Indiegogo share tools.
Tell all of your friends.

We look forward to bringing the story of the beautiful Mount Airy Lodge to the world, so THANK YOU in advance for all of your support!",6.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</h1>
</div>
<div>
<b>RAISE $7500 - </b><b>New Computer!</b>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>The Sensatron is running at capacity on a tiny computer. With more computing power we can animate the lights more smoothly, and add additional strands to the workload. A computer is relatively cheap at about $350, let's make it happen!</div>
<div>
<b>RAISE $8000 - </b><b>New Sensors!</b>
</div>
<div>The Sensatron is a portmanteau of ""sensation and ""electronic"". It was designed to take in the stimulus it experiences wherever it is and report it back with light to its home star, P-Cygni, which is about  5000 lightyears away in the constellation of Cygnus. For $500 more we can add a microphone, accelerometer, or other sensors to provide data for the array of lights to shine and have some money to pay for that coding. Help us reach that goal, the fate of the Cygnans rests on all of us!</div>
<div><b>RAISE $10,500 - New RAD Lights!</b></div>
<div>
<p>The Sensatron uses beautiful ""Total Control Lighting"" pixel strands. We want to up the ante and add more lights, and maybe at more frequencies (like 395nm) so that the Sensatron can shine deeper. $2,500 would be a rad budget for the lights, cabling, and coding.</p>
<p><b>RAISE $15,500 - Sensatron Festival Travel Budget!</b></p>
</div>
<div>Let's set the Sensatron loose on the Earth and see where it goes! With a budget of $5,000 we can afford a trailer and make the necessary mutations and travel fees to allow the Sensatron to participate in local Art Car shows across the country.</div>
<h2><b>The Road Ahead...</b></h2>
<div>If we raise more than $15,500 we will be rolling on the ""HOLY WOW!"" highway, where we can reinvent the Sensatron with resources that can pull off things like:</div>
<ul>
<li>RAD New Skin With Interior Lights: $2,500<br/>
</li>
<li>Newer Larger Chassis: $10,000<br/>
</li>
<li>New Larger Steel Pyramid: $5,000</li>
<li>A Real Work Budget: $10,000 or more<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>This is where the world gets to see what I can do with my amazing friends. The Sensatron is only possible with volunteer help, but I want to pay anyone who needs to make sacrifices to help make the Sensatron incredible.</div>

8th Voyage of the Sensatron

I'm Jason Siadek, designer of the Sensatron art car. I've been going to Burning Man since 1998, and 2016 will be my 18th burn (I skipped '99). I met my wife Julianne on the Sensatron's first ride on the playa in 2009. The car and our relationship have been evolving ever since. 
The Sensatron is my 3rd art car. My first two were the Lunar Rover and The Oasis. I've been creating art on a shoestring my whole life, now I'm reaching out to our community to build on this beautiful chassis.
I want to share the experience of the Sensatron with you, let's go on this journey together. 


What We Would Love

The Sensatron was made on a low budget of whatever I could afford and whatever people were willing to donate. Every year we've made incremental improvements. With your support we can take our art to the next level, and the people that are involved deeply can be compensated. That includes me, our coder, and whoever else who steps up to help in a big way. This is still a labor of love, and as an art piece I consider myself lucky just to express this into the world, but I can't afford to do it without your help. The Department of Mutant Vehicles raises the bar on what vehicles are allowed on the playa every year and I want to  rise above the challenge.

What We Need

The Sensatron has made it to the playa for seven amazing years. Now for its 8th year we are ready to go into >>HYPERSPACE<<
Here's what we need to achieve liftoff, roughly in order of importance:



Repair the radiator fan: $100

Decorate the front of the vehicle: $200
Yearly Storage: $600
Gasoline for the Playa: $150
Tune-Up: $100
Spare Tire: $100
New Flags: $600
Repair Tail Lights: $100
New Fur: $500
2 New Strands of LEDs: $200
4th of Juplaya Work/Play Adventure: $1,000

Playa Exit Plan: $1,000

Unforeseen Costs and Fees: $500
Work Budget: $2,000+


Total: $7,150

Other than that final hope of a work budget, these items are all priced close to their cost. At the bare minimum the Sensatron can be funded to pay for its maintenance and some key changes the Burning Man organization needs us to make. As the producer of this project I want to pay anyone that needs to put in serious hours to make the Sensatron awesome incarnate. If you can help with some money or time then we can do this together.

RAISE $8000 - New Sensors!

The Sensatron is a portmanteau of ""sensation and ""electronic"". It was designed to take in the stimulus it experiences wherever it is and report it back with light to its home star, P-Cygni, which is about  5000 lightyears away in the constellation of Cygnus. For $500 more we can add a microphone, accelerometer, or other sensors to provide data for the array of lights to shine and have some money to pay for that coding. Help us reach that goal, the fate of the Cygnans rests on all of us!
RAISE $10,500 - New RAD Lights!

The Sensatron uses beautiful ""Total Control Lighting"" pixel strands. We want to up the ante and add more lights, and maybe at more frequencies (like 395nm) so that the Sensatron can shine deeper. $2,500 would be a rad budget for the lights, cabling, and coding.
RAISE $15,500 - Sensatron Festival Travel Budget!

Let's set the Sensatron loose on the Earth and see where it goes! With a budget of $5,000 we can afford a trailer and make the necessary mutations and travel fees to allow the Sensatron to participate in local Art Car shows across the country.
The Road Ahead...
If we raise more than $15,500 we will be rolling on the ""HOLY WOW!"" highway, where we can reinvent the Sensatron with resources that can pull off things like:

RAD New Skin With Interior Lights: $2,500

Newer Larger Chassis: $10,000

New Larger Steel Pyramid: $5,000
A Real Work Budget: $10,000 or more



This is where the world gets to see what I can do with my amazing friends. The Sensatron is only possible with volunteer help, but I want to pay anyone who needs to make sacrifices to help make the Sensatron incredible.


Our >History and Our Future>

The Sensatron has been inspiring artists and transporting adventurers to the far reaches of the playa since 2009. We want to take you with us!
We have been featured in articles about what it's like to be inspired. We made new friends that fell in love on the Sensatron as they watched the sunrise, and then got married the next year using the Sensatron is the bridal chariot. 
The Sensatron has been photographed by many talented artists, such as Scott London, Trey Ratcliff, and Patrick Roddie. Let's make the Sensatron more beautiful so that those pictures blow more minds.



Risks & Challenges

If we don't raise enough money to handle all the costs then I will have to make hard decisions about what must be funded. At the bare minimum, this money will go into the gas tank!


Before being allowed onto the playa, the Sensatron must be accepted with a provisional license from the Department of Mutant Vehicles, which is flooded with requests for licenses every year. I'm reaching out to the community to see how ✨AWESOME!✨ we can make this veteran burner be. We want to sail through the playa DMV's long lines to the sound of cheers.

----------------------------------------------
What We Can Do Together
 The Sensatron has been the touch point for a lot of beautiful friendships and the vehicle for at least five weddings. It's more than a mutated vehicle, it's a rolling philosophy based on love and adventure. Your contribution will launch amazing people into amazing places.

</h3>
<p>OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE:</p><p></p>
<p><b>Trenton, New Jersey-</b> <b>March 3, 2016</b>: Emerging American
artist Anthony Fearron will debut his abstract works on canvas as part of Art
Expo NYC’s SOLO Exhibition from April 14–17 at Pier 94. Entitled <b>The
Birth Of Urban Futurizm</b>, the exhibit at Art Expo will feature nearly 30
works by Fearron, including his works on canvas, paper, capiz shell and wood,
as well as his notable <i>Blue Series</i> of
pen and ink drawings.</p>
<p>Born in 1955 on Long Island, Mr.
Fearron began seriously painting in 2003, applying color and textural elements to
canvas using twigs, leaves, metal scraps, toothpicks, hairpins and writing
implements in lieu of brushes. The works in this series combine acrylic paint,
pen and ink, spray paint and marker applied as layers of language and
mathematical symbols.<span>  He was the
featured artist at <b>The Abstract Room</b>
Gallery in Jim Thorpe, PA from 2012-2015. 
</span></p>
<p><b>The Birth of Urban Futurizm</b> highlights works that offer glimpses of man in a
world diminished by the digital age and the decline of ethics, struggling along
with nature to be seen against the chaos. ""I am moved by what I see as the
contemporary decay of our love and appreciation for the essence of what makes
us human, in spite of who we believe we are and what we do. These works try to reveal
the unseen; the web that binds raw and edgy mankind to nature and spirit, as
integral parts of the universe outside of and within us.""  </p>
<p>As a child,
Mr. Fearron was first exposed to abstract art on a museum trip where he first
saw the works of Jackson Pollack. "" I remember having a vivid sense of
vision and a wild imagination.</p>
<p>I loved
cartoons and used to make up crazy stories, but I'd not seen or conceived
anything like those huge works of abstract art.<span> 
It opened up a new door in terms of how I was thinking at the time.  After that, I drew a lot in notebooks –
experimenting with various styles and techniques by sketching in margins and doodling.  I was horrible at grammar and often fiddled
in notebooks with streams of equations and cursive loopy alphabetic symbols I'd
made up.  During a particularly difficult
time in high school, one art teacher (Mr. Houston) took serious interest in my
notebook and my creative use of letters and symbols, and encouraged me to
express it on paper and canvas.  I still use
this technique as a foundation for each piece - language and symbols as the
base layer, and building upwards with colors, gesso or pen and ink elements.""</span></p>
<p>This exhibition is organized in
collaboration with The Abstract Room and The Euphemia Gallery, Hightstown, New
Jersey.<span>  Installation and framing of
artworks in this series has been made possible by the generous support of Doug Elkins and LuAnn Mizzoni and collector Jim Gordon. </span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Delta Ujamaa Festival, May 22-25, 2020 is a 3-Day Black Thought, Art, Music, Dinner-Theatre, Food, Fun and Love gathering of the Black Community!</p>
<p>The festival is being held in historic Glendora, Mississippi which has the unfortunate distinction of being the location of Emmett Till's murder.  Mississippi is a microcosm of Black Life in the U.S. and how we are perceived.  Glendora, in particular, needs the collective work and cooperative economics of the Black community to provide the uplift it needs.  The town is 99% African-American and many live well below the poverty level.  <u><i><strong>Our goal is to build affordable housing for the residents from a percentage of the festival events proceeds (This is a public-private business venture).  Your support will help us make a collective statement to the world that the Black community can and does work together!</strong></i></u></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking support to raise $25,000 in 45 days that will allow us to secure 3-national speakers/artists, prepare the venue and market the festival.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support we have put together a few perks that we hope you'll love!</p>
<p>In the event that we are unable to reach our goal, we will use the funds raised for the purpose as stated above, securing our speakers/artists, venue preparation and marketing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are working with the elected officials of Glendora and their community leaders to generate revenue for their residents and affordable housing.  We anticipate having 100+ Black-owned vendors and we will produce 3- Dinner/Play and 3-Brunch/Play events.  This is truly a ""For Us, By Us"" project where EVERYBODY is economically empowered!</p>
<p>As the Organizer (Dr. Deborah D. Jenkins), I have a successful track record in creating revenue opportunities and managing a $250M Housing Corporation as the CFO.  I have been in business since 2000 and have been able to assist many others in creating generational wealth.  This is the blueprint for the New Black Wall Street, join us!</p>Because I value all contributions and understand that some may be skeptical I will provide progress reports privately for any who request via email.</div><div>

<h3>Mon parcours</h3>
<p>Je suis fille et petite fille d'artiste, ma mère Micheline Prézeau, est l'une des premières femme peintre d'Haïti. Grâce à elle, j'ai eu la chance de grandir dans un environnement à la fois artistique et international.<br/><br/>C'est en Haïti, au Musée d'art Haitien du Collège Saint -Pierre et à l'Institut Français, en 2007, que j'ai réalisé ma plus grande exposition, une rétrospective rassemblait plus d'une centaine d'oeuvres, sur une période de vingt ans (1987 à 2007). J'y ai aussi rencontré mon plus grand défi, la réalisation d'une murale de 70 mètres de long: ""Le mur du temps"", immédiatement approprié par la jeune génération de musiciens qui l'intègre désormais,  comme arrière-plan, dans leurs vidéos clip.<br/><br/>Parallèlement, ma participation en 2015, à la Biennale de Venise, fut une expérience extrêmement gratifiante, m'apportant une certaine reconnaissance, ainsi qu'une  visibilité auprès des Musées et Institutions internationales. <br/><br/>Ainsi, ma récente participation à l'exposition itinérante ""Relationrelational Undercurrents-Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago, a été présentée du 1er avril au 5 mai 2019 au Portland Museum of Art, aux USA.</p>
<p>Pour cette année 2019, je souhaite commémorer mes trente années de création artistique par la production d'une oeuvre que j'ai intitulé: ""Le cercle Atlantique"", ce livre d’art bilingue (français, anglais) de 200 pages, rassemblera des textes critiques d’académiciens spécialistes de l’Histoire de l’art Caribéen, reconnus internationalement, ainsi que des articles et entrevues rédigés par des journalistes prestigieux de France et du Sénégal.</p>
<p>Plus d’une cinquantaine de reproductions hautes définition, contribueront à vulgariser une partie de mes archives visuelles, constituées d’oeuvres réalisées au Canada de 1987 à 1989 ; à Paris de 1989 à 1993 ; au Sénégal de 1993 à 1995 ; en Haïti de 1995 à 2015. Celles-ci seront complétées par des images de trente années de réalisations in situ, à travers le monde.</p>
<p>L’ouvrage sera enrichi d’extraits d’articles de presse, d’une bibliographie exhaustive et d’une compilation de liens URL.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtiendrez</h3>
<p>En ce moment, j'ai pu finaliser la 1ère partie du plan de production de l'édition numérique de mon livre: ""Le cercle Atlantique"" grâce entre autre à l'obtention de la subvention Fokal.</p>
<p>Toutefois, Maintenant que je finalise la préparation de mon plan de production, je vous sollicite tous, familles, amis, contacts professionnels ou tout autre personne passionnée par mes oeuvres et/ou démarche artistique à vous impliquer dans ce projet passionnant.</p>
<p>Avec votre aide, je pourrai assurément aller de l'avant et franchir les étapes nécessaires à la production du livre physique dont l'investissement est assez conséquent. Les fonds que je tente d'obtenir permettront de couvrir:</p>
<ul>
<li>Le coût de production du livre (impression);</li>
<li>Les coûts d'édition (graphisme, révision, traduction);</li>
<li>Le cachet des auteurs et photographes;</li>
<li>Les coûts logistiques (transport);</li>
<li>Les coûts de promotion (relations publiques, marketing Web et graphisme)</li>
</ul>

<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>Je vous invite chaleureusement à faire partie de mon nouveau projet!</p>
<p>Ma démarche artistique et philosophique résultent d’un processus de transformation constante, le mouvement, le déplacement conduisent à remettre en question les préjugés, tout en invitant à  la réflexion sur la mémoire, le passé, mais aussi sur les enjeux sociétaux actuels.</p>

<p>Je souhaite mettre gratuitement à la disposition des étudiants et des chercheurs des filières Histoire de l’art, Caribbean Studies, Black Studies, Women Studies, Haitian Studies, le contenu de 30 années de d’innovation créatrices, dont l’œuvre plastique résulte de l’élaboration d’un langage neuf, original et personnel puisant aux sources des héritages, taino, africains et intemporels.</p>

<h3>Risques et challenges</h3>

<h2>My journey</h2>
<p>I am a daughter and granddaughter of an artist, my mother Micheline Prézeau, is one of the first woman painter of Haiti. Thanks to her, I had the chance to grow in an environment that is both artistic and international.</p>
<p>It is in Haiti, at the Museum of Haitian Arts in College Saint-Pierre and the French Institute, in 2007, that I realized my biggest exhibition, a retrospective that compiled more than a hundred works of art, produced over a period of twenty years (1987 to 2007). I also met my biggest challenge, the realization of a mural spreading 70 meters long: ""The wall of time"", immediately appropriated by the younger generation of musicians who now integrates it, as a background, in their clip videos.</p>
<p>At the same time, my participation in 2015 at the Venice Biennale was an extremely gratifying experience, bringing me a certain recognition, as well as a visibility with Museums and International Institutions.</p>
<p>So, my recent participation in the traveling exhibition «Relation Undercurrents. The Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago was presented from April 1 to May 5, 2019 at the Portland Museum of Art, USA.</p>
<p>For this year 2019, I wish to commemorate my thirty years of artistic creation by the production of a work that I entitled: ""The Atlantic Circle"", is a 200-pages bilingual (French, English) art book, that will bring together Critical texts by internationally recognized academics of the history of Caribbean art, as well as articles and interviews written by prestigious journalists from France and Senegal.</p>
<p>More than fifty high-definition reproductions will help to popularize a part of my visual archives, made up of works made in Canada from 1987 to 1989; in Paris from 1989 to 1993; in Senegal from 1993 to 1995;  In Haiti from 1995 to 2015. That will also be complemented by images of thirty years of achievements in situ, around the world.</p>
<p>The book will be enriched with excerpts from press articles, a comprehensive bibliography and a compilation of URL links.</p>
<p>What I need and what you will get</p>
<p>Currently, I was able to finalize the first part of the production plan of the digital edition of my book: ""The Atlantic Circle"" thanks among other things to obtaining a grant from the FOKAL Foundation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless in order to finalize the preparation of my production plan, I ask you all, families, friends, business contacts or others that are passionate by my work and / or artistic approach to get involved in this exciting project.</p>
<p>With your help, I will certainly be able to go ahead and take the necessary steps to produce the physical book, which is quite a substantial investment. The funds that I attempted get will cover:</p>
<p>●        The cost of producing the book (printing );</p>
<p>●        Publishing costs (graphic design, revision, translation );</p>
<p>●        The stamp of authors and photographers;</p>
<p>●        the costs logistics (transport);</p>
<p>●        Promotion costs (public relations, web marketing and graphics)</p>

<h2>The impact</h2>
<p>I warmly invite you to be part of my new project!</p>
<p>My artistic and philosophical approach go through a process of constant transformation, the motion, and the movement lead to challenge prejudices while inviting reflection on memory, the past, but also on current social issues.</p>
<p>My ambition is to contribute to the transmission and preservation of the knowledge of an exceptional body of works, belonging to the current heritage, shared between Haiti and Canada, by the valorization and the popularization of the contribution of an artist of the Haitian community, to worldwide contemporary visual creation.</p>
<p>I wish to make it available free of charge for students and researchers of Art History, Caribbean Studies , Black Studies , Women Studies , Haitian Studies , the content of 30 years of creative innovation, whose plastic work results from the development of a new, original and personal language drawing from the sources of heritage, taino, African and timeless.</p>
<p>To carry out this fabulous project, renowned artists have decided to support me in this adventure including:</p>

Mon parcours
Je suis fille et petite fille d'artiste, ma mère Micheline Prézeau, est l'une des premières femme peintre d'Haïti. Grâce à elle, j'ai eu la chance de grandir dans un environnement à la fois artistique et international.C'est en Haïti, au Musée d'art Haitien du Collège Saint -Pierre et à l'Institut Français, en 2007, que j'ai réalisé ma plus grande exposition, une rétrospective rassemblait plus d'une centaine d'oeuvres, sur une période de vingt ans (1987 à 2007). J'y ai aussi rencontré mon plus grand défi, la réalisation d'une murale de 70 mètres de long: ""Le mur du temps"", immédiatement approprié par la jeune génération de musiciens qui l'intègre désormais,  comme arrière-plan, dans leurs vidéos clip.Parallèlement, ma participation en 2015, à la Biennale de Venise, fut une expérience extrêmement gratifiante, m'apportant une certaine reconnaissance, ainsi qu'une  visibilité auprès des Musées et Institutions internationales. Ainsi, ma récente participation à l'exposition itinérante ""Relationrelational Undercurrents-Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago, a été présentée du 1er avril au 5 mai 2019 au Portland Museum of Art, aux USA.
Pour cette année 2019, je souhaite commémorer mes trente années de création artistique par la production d'une oeuvre que j'ai intitulé: ""Le cercle Atlantique"", ce livre d’art bilingue (français, anglais) de 200 pages, rassemblera des textes critiques d’académiciens spécialistes de l’Histoire de l’art Caribéen, reconnus internationalement, ainsi que des articles et entrevues rédigés par des journalistes prestigieux de France et du Sénégal.
Plus d’une cinquantaine de reproductions hautes définition, contribueront à vulgariser une partie de mes archives visuelles, constituées d’oeuvres réalisées au Canada de 1987 à 1989 ; à Paris de 1989 à 1993 ; au Sénégal de 1993 à 1995 ; en Haïti de 1995 à 2015. Celles-ci seront complétées par des images de trente années de réalisations in situ, à travers le monde.
L’ouvrage sera enrichi d’extraits d’articles de presse, d’une bibliographie exhaustive et d’une compilation de liens URL.

Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtiendrez
En ce moment, j'ai pu finaliser la 1ère partie du plan de production de l'édition numérique de mon livre: ""Le cercle Atlantique"" grâce entre autre à l'obtention de la subvention Fokal.
Toutefois, Maintenant que je finalise la préparation de mon plan de production, je vous sollicite tous, familles, amis, contacts professionnels ou tout autre personne passionnée par mes oeuvres et/ou démarche artistique à vous impliquer dans ce projet passionnant.

Je vous invite chaleureusement à faire partie de mon nouveau projet!
Ma démarche artistique et philosophique résultent d’un processus de transformation constante, le mouvement, le déplacement conduisent à remettre en question les préjugés, tout en invitant à  la réflexion sur la mémoire, le passé, mais aussi sur les enjeux sociétaux actuels.
Mon ambition est de contribuer à la transmission et la préservation de la connaissance d’un corpus d’œuvres exceptionnel, appartenant au patrimoine actuel, partagé entre Haïti et le Canada, par la valorisation et la vulgarisation de l’apport d’une artiste de la communauté haïtienne, à la création visuelle contemporaine mondiale.
Je souhaite mettre gratuitement à la disposition des étudiants et des chercheurs des filières Histoire de l’art, Caribbean Studies, Black Studies, Women Studies, Haitian Studies, le contenu de 30 années de d’innovation créatrices, dont l’œuvre plastique résulte de l’élaboration d’un langage neuf, original et personnel puisant aux sources des héritages, taino, africains et intemporels.
Pour mener à bien ce fabuleux projet, des artistes de renom ont décidé de me soutenir dans cette aventure dont:

Risques et challenges
Tel que mentionné précédemment, bien que nous avons quasiment couvert les coûts de production de l'édition numérique, ceux liés à la production du livre vont au-delà de mes ressources financières.
Cette entreprise est un grand défi, car j’y ai déjà investi et confronté les frais de conception graphique, la numérisation de mes archives pour m'assurer que ce projet soit de grande qualité.
En dehors du défi des ressources financières exigées par un tel projet, l'autre challenge concerne la coordination logistique des livraison estimées. j'ai monté une équipe autour de moi ainsi qui me permettra de vous assurer une expérience d'achat des plus limpides: chaque récompense sera remise en temps et en heure.
Je ne manquerai pas de vous tenir informé tout au long du processus des updates concernant la livraison des récompenses!

English version
My journey
I am a daughter and granddaughter of an artist, my mother Micheline Prézeau, is one of the first woman painter of Haiti. Thanks to her, I had the chance to grow in an environment that is both artistic and international.
It is in Haiti, at the Museum of Haitian Arts in College Saint-Pierre and the French Institute, in 2007, that I realized my biggest exhibition, a retrospective that compiled more than a hundred works of art, produced over a period of twenty years (1987 to 2007). I also met my biggest challenge, the realization of a mural spreading 70 meters long: ""The wall of time"", immediately appropriated by the younger generation of musicians who now integrates it, as a background, in their clip videos.
At the same time, my participation in 2015 at the Venice Biennale was an extremely gratifying experience, bringing me a certain recognition, as well as a visibility with Museums and International Institutions.
So, my recent participation in the traveling exhibition «Relation Undercurrents. The Contemporary Art of the Caribbean Archipelago was presented from April 1 to May 5, 2019 at the Portland Museum of Art, USA.
For this year 2019, I wish to commemorate my thirty years of artistic creation by the production of a work that I entitled: ""The Atlantic Circle"", is a 200-pages bilingual (French, English) art book, that will bring together Critical texts by internationally recognized academics of the history of Caribbean art, as well as articles and interviews written by prestigious journalists from France and Senegal.
More than fifty high-definition reproductions will help to popularize a part of my visual archives, made up of works made in Canada from 1987 to 1989; in Paris from 1989 to 1993; in Senegal from 1993 to 1995;  In Haiti from 1995 to 2015. That will also be complemented by images of thirty years of achievements in situ, around the world.
The book will be enriched with excerpts from press articles, a comprehensive bibliography and a compilation of URL links.
What I need and what you will get
Currently, I was able to finalize the first part of the production plan of the digital edition of my book: ""The Atlantic Circle"" thanks among other things to obtaining a grant from the FOKAL Foundation.
Nevertheless in order to finalize the preparation of my production plan, I ask you all, families, friends, business contacts or others that are passionate by my work and / or artistic approach to get involved in this exciting project.
With your help, I will certainly be able to go ahead and take the necessary steps to produce the physical book, which is quite a substantial investment. The funds that I attempted get will cover:
●        The cost of producing the book (printing );
●        Publishing costs (graphic design, revision, translation );
●        The stamp of authors and photographers;
●        the costs logistics (transport);
●        Promotion costs (public relations, web marketing and graphics)

The impact
I warmly invite you to be part of my new project!
My artistic and philosophical approach go through a process of constant transformation, the motion, and the movement lead to challenge prejudices while inviting reflection on memory, the past, but also on current social issues.
My ambition is to contribute to the transmission and preservation of the knowledge of an exceptional body of works, belonging to the current heritage, shared between Haiti and Canada, by the valorization and the popularization of the contribution of an artist of the Haitian community, to worldwide contemporary visual creation.
I wish to make it available free of charge for students and researchers of Art History, Caribbean Studies , Black Studies , Women Studies , Haitian Studies , the content of 30 years of creative innovation, whose plastic work results from the development of a new, original and personal language drawing from the sources of heritage, taino, African and timeless.

Risks and challenges
As mentioned earlier, although we have almost fully covered the production costs of digital publishing, those related to the production of books go beyond my financial resources.
This is a big challenge, because I have already invested and confronted the cost of graphic design, the digitization of my archives to ensure the quality of this project.
Apart from the challenge of the financial resources required for such a project, the other challenge concerns the logistics coordination of the estimated deliveries. I have built a team around me that will allow me to ensure you get the most limpid shopping experience: each reward will be delivered on time.
I will be sure to keep you informed throughout the update process regarding the delivery of awards!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been teaching Mythology for nearly a decade and I now have enough to say on the subject to fill a book. Or two or three.  But we're starting with one: <i><strong>Myth Education</strong></i>. </p>
<p>There are a lot of books on the subject, so what makes <strong><i>Myth Education</i></strong> unique?</p>
<p>A lot of books on mythology suffer from one of two problems, either (1) being too dry and esoteric or (2) being sanitized to appeal to a younger audience.  <i><strong>Myth Education</strong></i> takes the middle path and is accessible to anyone (whether they've studied mythology for years or have only seen a <i>Thor<i> </i></i>movie) but remains honest about the original stories and characters -- warts and all.  Sex and violence are necessary components to many myths and I don't believe in sanitizing them away. <i><strong>Myth Education</strong></i> is for adults, not for kindergartners. But, anyone who can handle a PG13 movie should be able to handle this book just fine.</p>
<p>The other element that will make this book stand out and the reason for this campaign is the art. <strong><i>Myth Education</i></strong> presents a unique approach to these stories and characters that is both entertaining and informative, but the words are only part of it. With help from your donations I will be able to commission work from a bevy of artists to create original art that will make this book truly stand out from the crowd.  I teach at an art school and have seen the kind of work these stories and characters inspire and more importantly, I've learned that <u>artists need to be paid.</u>  I refuse to ask other people to work for the sake of ""exposure"" or the promise of payment later on.  Artists need to be paid.  And if we can pay them we'll get some tremendous work to accompany the text.  </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>We have secured a publisher</i>. It's a small press publisher, but <strong><i>Myth Education</i></strong> will be available on at least three continents and in several digital formats. But, in order to make it as exciting to look at as it is to read I need help raising money to hire artists.  The more money we raise the more art we'll be able to commission -- any additional money not spent on art will be put toward marketing so your donations will have a very real effect on both the quality and success of this book.  And if this book does well I have several others in the works.</p>
<p>Perks for donors include getting your name listed in the special thanks and free copies of the final product as well as the opportunity to select a mythic figure you'd like to see featured in the book and to have that piece dedicated to you (or someone else of your choosing), and you can get yourself a printed copy of some of the original artwork created for the book.  And, most importantly (and most improbably) for one donation of $10,000 I will personally worship you as my personal god for one year, making sacrifices of animal crackers on an altar.  I mean, who wouldn't want that?</p>
<p>If we meet our goal of $2,000 the book will feature some spectacular art.  If we exceed the goal it'll mean more and more art, some additional marketing and (depending on how much we raise) it'll lay the ground work for the publication of more books by me.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I love mythology. I love writing about it, I love studying it, I love teaching it. It is beautiful and upsetting and hilarious.  And I think there is tremendous value in knowing the stories and characters that have helped shape both our culture and our minds. We better understand the past and the present through looking at the mythologies of the world. This is the shared cultural history of humanity. And making it not just accessible but vibrant for a modern audience is how we can best celebrate that. With your help, <i><strong>Myth Education</strong></i> can be that celebration. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>For those of you who are interested in this book or mythology or creative endeavors in general but are not able to make a donation there is still plenty of ways you can help.  </p>
<p>Share the links. Share them again and again.  Indiegogo makes it very easy. Just click on one of many links and share it on Facebook, Twitter or whatever social media you have.  Donations are great, but the only way to get people to make donations is to make sure they know about the campaign. So share it. Pass it on. Put this campaign on your wedding registry (congratulations!) or in your obituary (condolences!) or anything else you can think of. The more people know about it the more we'll be able to raise and the better the final product will be.</p>

<h3>Brief history of the project</h3>
<p>My name is Pietro Fedele, 26, from Pescara, Italy. </p>
<p>After attending the Art School, I got a degree in industrial design that allowed me to delve into modelling studies and a master's degree in multimedia design thanks to which I have been involved in the study of Exhibit Design. My studies led me to become a drawer, a multimedia and industrial designer, and they have done nothing but suggesting me the means to tell the stories that I deem are worth telling. Today’s story is on the refugees.</p>
<h3>It is urgent to tell this story!</h3>
<p>Nowadays we hear about them every day, everywhere, but the image that flashed continually in my head and asked to be expressed, was that of a mass of people without identity. They are just the refugees, the nameless, the rescued, the migrants, the invaders… and I said to myself: I must tell their story!</p>
<p>Interviews? Reportage? Photographs? None of that. What I wanted to realize was instead an itinerant art installation, in motion, as are refugees.</p>
<p>The subject I wanted to deal was that of identity and of political, social and geographical barriers.</p>
<p><strong>The Art Installations</strong></p>
<p>The first installation will be held in the streets of the city center, where small groups of mannequins without a body, but just ""floating"" clothes standing in significant poses will be exposed without specific description.</p>
<p> «Who are they?» I hope, passers-by will wonder this when looking at these tragic and quiet figures that, perhaps only by their clothing, will recall the refugees.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483982189/uofq2ghccftmqvnjnqy4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>I removed the vowels from the title, just as I removed the identity from the figures.</i></p>
<p>Subsequent installations  will take place inside the covered market of piazza Muzii in Pescara, at the charity event organized by AVSI. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484052034/ni3p6szculxytj6zjknv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>In the second installation figures ""hanging from a fence with barbed"" appear. They recall the anguished “climbings” on border barriers. When we see the pictures taken on site, these figures - that I will purposely call the hung - seem still, impotent, crucified, dramatic. A ragged semi-transparent tarp stands between the visitors and the work: another barrier, a translucent curtain full of meanings. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484052054/r6ts3r4xkuaqeyd9wqep.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the third installation  a sole figure, there is a migrant with his hands tied behind his back. He is wearing a life belt which is, in turn, surrounded by a ring of barbed wire. His feet are in the Mediterranean Sea, represented on a map of Europe on the ground. The life belt gives only the illusion of saving but its tied arms, giving a sense of helplessness, the barbed wire and the geographic barriers are real constraints that make these crossings: “the crossings of death”.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484052073/ez4rh0yo1tlifgojdwlh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the fourth, a group of refugees is covered, harnessed, cold, seated, surrendered on a mattress, oars in hand, as if they were on a raft. Around them there are barbed barriers with slogans inciting to shutting and rejection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484052093/w7awjplrt1uz3vivcdbj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The event in Pescara will just be the springboard for an exhibition that will travel to other cities, whose municipalities or non-profit and cultural associations will decide to host the installations and continue sharing with us the project.</p>
<p><strong>WHY TAKING PART TO THE FUND RAISING</strong> </p>
<p>I think making this project is worth especially for a reason: there is a need for awareness-raising and art is the best way to do that because a work of art never holds a single shareable or not shareable message, but opens to a deeper reading, raises questions, remains engraved in the mind, thus generating a reflection.</p>
<p>For this reason, I ask you to help me in carrying out this work by participating in the crowdfunding. Actually becoming partakers and authors of this project, together with me!</p>
<h2>What I Need </h2>
<p>My budjet is 2500€ </p>
<p>The Goal of 2500 € will allow me to carry out one or two installations, video material and photos. </p>
<p>The expenses I will face are the following:</p>

</div></div>","Brief history of the project
My name is Pietro Fedele, 26, from Pescara, Italy. 
After attending the Art School, I got a degree in industrial design that allowed me to delve into modelling studies and a master's degree in multimedia design thanks to which I have been involved in the study of Exhibit Design. My studies led me to become a drawer, a multimedia and industrial designer, and they have done nothing but suggesting me the means to tell the stories that I deem are worth telling. Today’s story is on the refugees.
It is urgent to tell this story!
Nowadays we hear about them every day, everywhere, but the image that flashed continually in my head and asked to be expressed, was that of a mass of people without identity. They are just the refugees, the nameless, the rescued, the migrants, the invaders… and I said to myself: I must tell their story!
Interviews? Reportage? Photographs? None of that. What I wanted to realize was instead an itinerant art installation, in motion, as are refugees.
The subject I wanted to deal was that of identity and of political, social and geographical barriers.
The Art Installations
The first installation will be held in the streets of the city center, where small groups of mannequins without a body, but just ""floating"" clothes standing in significant poses will be exposed without specific description.
 «Who are they?» I hope, passers-by will wonder this when looking at these tragic and quiet figures that, perhaps only by their clothing, will recall the refugees.

I removed the vowels from the title, just as I removed the identity from the figures.
Subsequent installations  will take place inside the covered market of piazza Muzii in Pescara, at the charity event organized by AVSI. 


In the second installation figures ""hanging from a fence with barbed"" appear. They recall the anguished “climbings” on border barriers. When we see the pictures taken on site, these figures - that I will purposely call the hung - seem still, impotent, crucified, dramatic. A ragged semi-transparent tarp stands between the visitors and the work: another barrier, a translucent curtain full of meanings. 

In the third installation  a sole figure, there is a migrant with his hands tied behind his back. He is wearing a life belt which is, in turn, surrounded by a ring of barbed wire. His feet are in the Mediterranean Sea, represented on a map of Europe on the ground. The life belt gives only the illusion of saving but its tied arms, giving a sense of helplessness, the barbed wire and the geographic barriers are real constraints that make these crossings: “the crossings of death”.

In the fourth, a group of refugees is covered, harnessed, cold, seated, surrendered on a mattress, oars in hand, as if they were on a raft. Around them there are barbed barriers with slogans inciting to shutting and rejection.

The event in Pescara will just be the springboard for an exhibition that will travel to other cities, whose municipalities or non-profit and cultural associations will decide to host the installations and continue sharing with us the project.
WHY TAKING PART TO THE FUND RAISING 
I think making this project is worth especially for a reason: there is a need for awareness-raising and art is the best way to do that because a work of art never holds a single shareable or not shareable message, but opens to a deeper reading, raises questions, remains engraved in the mind, thus generating a reflection.
For this reason, I ask you to help me in carrying out this work by participating in the crowdfunding. Actually becoming partakers and authors of this project, together with me!
What I Need 
My budjet is 2500€ 
The Goal of 2500 € will allow me to carry out one or two installations, video material and photos. 
The expenses I will face are the following:
-Purchase of 5 or 6 metres of iron tube for each mannequin plus joints and pedestals (about 90-100 € per figure),.
-Transportation costs (about 150€);
-Costs of the lighting system for the installations (about 200€);
-Rent of a working space with suitable equipment for the assembling of the installations (approximately 500€);
-Purchase of additional materials to metal tubular skeletons (barbed wire, metal wire netting, fabrics, clothing, cables, plastic etc.), variable cost from € 200 to € 500;
-Costs of graphic works (flyers, prints for the installations, catalogue etc.) and video production 400€.
The real goal is this: more money we can collect and the work that I will to create will be more effective and complete.
I have fixed intermediate budgets. With 3500 € I will be able to make one of three installations in addition to the initial event. With 5000 € I will make the first part and two installations. As mentioned above, the budget that would allow me the complete realisation of the project is 7000€.
If I do not will reach the goal
If I do not will reach the goal of 2500 € the money collected will be used for the same project. More money will be collected by other benefactors. The progress of the project can be followed on facebook page.

<h3>Hello.</h3>
<p><br/>My campaign funds will allow me to purchase the equipment and supplies needed to start a cottage studio where plastic bags are the main working material. Plastic bags and cotton twine.</p>
<p>We produce a LOT of TRASH and as an artist, making it into something else seems a good way to deal with it. Think about the glut of plastic bags you get with every purchase. I can weave those bags into sleeping mats or into artful wall hangings.</p>
<p>I can DONATE sleeping mats to my homeless neighbors and SELL artful wall hangings.</p>
<p>I know people crochet plastic bags into tote bags, but weaving is so much faster and mats are so much softer and water resistant, too! I also want to get away from wool because industrial sheep shearing is not a pretty thing.</p>
<p>The only cost is the tapestry/rug loom. (Leclerc Gobelin High-Warp Tapestry Loom) Which comes in at about $4500.00 (shipping and handling included. Shipping weight: 160 lbs (72 kg.)  For a 60” loom). The remaining $1500.00 will be for twine (the twine is the vertical thread while the bags, processed, become the horizontal thread) and accessories for the loom.</p>
<p>There are no risks. It's a one-time thing. When I raise the money, I'll make the mats and other things. What do you get out of all of this? Well, a sleeping mat, a rug or a waIl hanging.</p>
<p>PLEASE tell you friends about my idea ... as they say ... 'Get the word out!'</p>

<p>My name is Andrea Rodríguez and I am a chilean artist, working with ceramics. Part of my work reflects my love and admiration for the animal world. With my sculptures and installations I’m constantly tackling the ever-fragile animal v/s human relationship, exploring concepts such animal threats, extinction, and domestication.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’ve also been exploring the abstract world, giving to my artwork different visual possibilities, and therefore, different meanings.</p>
<p>As an artist, i'm interested in expressing mi concerns about the preservation of endangered chilean animals, exploring and tackling the complicated relationship between human beings, nature and the vast amount of species that constitute it: </p>
<p><u><a href=""http://www.andrearodriguezvial.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.andrearodriguezvial.com</a></u></p>
<p><strong>Why the Crowdfunding?</strong></p>
<p>The reason why I’m doing this Crowdfunding is because I’ve been selected to do a 12 weeks, residency period at the European Ceramic Work Center (EKWC), in The Netherlands, from April 19th until July 11 2018.</p>
<p>In my country there are very few, if any, schools or workshops to deepen this technique. so i’m raising funds to cover the costs involved to be able to participate in this amazing place.</p>
<p>This center is known around the world as a center of excellence, because of its facilities and the best technical equipment. For me it will be an exceptional and unique opportunity to develop my artistic project and work on a completely different scale. I’ll be working 50 hours a week, being able to use all of its facilities, and learning from their highly qualified staff:</p>
<p><a href=""https://sundaymorning.ekwc.nl/en/over-ons/mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://sundaymorning.ekwc.nl/en/over-ons/mission/</a></p>
<p>Well-known artists such as Tony Cragg, Akio Takamori and David Zink Yi have been also working in this center, giving to this place an unique and qualified status.</p>
<p>With your support I’ll be able to work in one of the best places in the world specialized in ceramics, which will help me to improve my professional development  and to promote, in an artistic way, my concerns regarding endangered species, a worldwide problem in which nowadays is important to care about.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The project:</strong></p>
<p>The specific project regarding this Residency, consists out of continuing a project i started within I was working in Berlín and that concerns a specific endangered South American native animal called Pudú.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515514040/esykidy2blfmsmvg42af.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Pudú is the world’ smallest deer, that habits in some South American countries like in Chile and Argentina. This animal is nowadays classified as endangered species, mainly because of overhunting and habitat loss. So their biggest threat for their proper conservation are men. In Chile, Pudús are protected in various national parks and zoos. Efforts to preserve the pudú species are being taken in order to prevent extinction.</p>
<p>While I was in Berlín i created a natural size Pudú, in clay, and then took the mold of it.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515514485/vh3l4tvnvqc47asreoi9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>While i'm at EKWC i want to make the mold of each part of the mold of the Pudú (""The mold of the mold one could say"") and then, reproduce in ceramic each part of the mold of the Pudú, for then be glazed and fired. I need to do work at this place because I'll learn and have all the equipment and facilities to do a good job.</p>
<p>The final work will consist out of an installation conformed by each part of the mold of the Pudú, made with ceramic and displayed in a way such, that the audience will be challenged, through the negative, to recognize each part of the figure. Like a puzzle that they have to reconstruct to obtain the main figure again. Concepts such as absence, memory, and frailty will be represented by this, alluding to what is not longer present (or will not be in the future if this species finally extinct)</p>
<p><i>As an example, here are some reproductions of molds made in ceramic and glazed with bronze pigment:</i></p>

<h3>Hello World!</h3>
<p>For those of you who don't know me, my name is Emily Dumas. I was born and raised in Vermont, and currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. I am an artist who uses creative outlets as mediums to best interact with the world around me. As I discover who I am and what I want to be in this life, it becomes plain to me that my truest happiness and sense of meaning comes when creating.</p>
<p>I plan to go on residency to realize a concept I have been developing for some time. As a young artist who is still unmasking the ways of a professional art career, this focused period of time is invaluable. Not only will I be in environments teeming with international artistic professionals, but the space is cultivated entirely for the discipline and focus required to produce art of meaning. </p>
<p>I envision a large body of work that encompasses many mediums; all of the pieces tied by the motifs, topics and narrative surrounding:</p>
<p><i>Ancestral Inheritance, Elements of Self, Conception, Time</i> </p>
<p>All of this work culminating with an exhibition.</p>

</div></div>","Hello World!
For those of you who don't know me, my name is Emily Dumas. I was born and raised in Vermont, and currently reside in Brooklyn, NY. I am an artist who uses creative outlets as mediums to best interact with the world around me. As I discover who I am and what I want to be in this life, it becomes plain to me that my truest happiness and sense of meaning comes when creating.
I plan to go on residency to realize a concept I have been developing for some time. As a young artist who is still unmasking the ways of a professional art career, this focused period of time is invaluable. Not only will I be in environments teeming with international artistic professionals, but the space is cultivated entirely for the discipline and focus required to produce art of meaning. 
I envision a large body of work that encompasses many mediums; all of the pieces tied by the motifs, topics and narrative surrounding:
Ancestral Inheritance, Elements of Self, Conception, Time 
All of this work culminating with an exhibition.

Prototypes and concepts for 'Arm Guys' textile sculptures 


The Plan
(December 1st- 25th) Art See Ocean Gallery is run by couple Theresa and Stefan Lekberg. Both are working artists, supporting themselves as well as the international artist community through their residency program in Sweden, just south of Stockholm. https://www.stefanlekberg.com/
(January 1st- 31st) Gæsteatelier Hollufgård is an art center in Odense, Denmark, offering education, workshops and housing to both Danish and international artists and community. http://gah.dk/?lang=e
I began research  and applications for residency programs in August this year. I have been open to all residencies and options, as some of the places I really wanted to go didn't fit in with the timing of my trip, although I got positive feedback from my applications. Each program asks for 'tuition' which covers the studios space & accommodation, food, the community and resources affixed with the art centers. 
Tuition Fees: $2,000
Travel: $1,000
.05% Indiegogo: $150
Any additional funding over my goal of $3000, will go towards materials, museum admissions in the cities I visit, the shipping costs associated with sending the installation from residency to residency and back to New York. 
Every single dollar will be acknowledged and appreciated! I will be keeping an online journal to share my process, experiments, thoughts and finished work with my supporters (you!). I've also thought up some fun gifts to send from along my journey, and some pieces of art in 'thanks.'
My last installation took about 2 months of production work, which is where I am basing my timeline and ideas of production for this body. Fellow artist Julie Kenniston and I completed Introspection in September of 2017.

The Impact
Your support is simultaneously supporting international art institutions and all they stand for: International community, appreciation and validation of creativity, alternative entrepreneurship, global compassion, education and empathy.

I understand that not everyone can help with funding, but if you could spread the word and get others excited, that would mean so much! Art is important, and now more than ever; it is the key to our human experience and the history we leave behind.

It is the best method we have to understand and connect with the beautiful universe we find ourselves in. Leaps forward in the subject, such as the detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO team, are incredibly exciting and deserve to be celebrated.The Institute of Physics has teamed up with London-based entrepreneur Joshua Summers and Paris-based designer Louise Métvier to produce a commemorative poster to mark the first anniversary of this event. The poster will help raise funds for Physics for Development, a program run by the Institute of Physics, a London-based charity dedicated to ensuring that physics delivers on its exceptional potential to benefit society.The PosterThe gravitational waves detected by LIGO were caused when two black holes spiralled into each other. As they drew closer together they orbited ever faster, and the strength of the gravitational waves they created increased, reaching its peak when the black holes collided and merged. The poster depicts these spiralling black holes and the waves they created.The design was inspired by the imagery used by NASA on their official press release announcing the detection, seen below on the left.The poster is available in four formats:
A digital download of the black & white image
A black & white print
A Tribute to the Collision of Black Holes black & black print
100 posters signed by three members of the LIGO team

The detection of gravitational waves was only possible due to the collision of two black holes. We wanted to pay tribute to their lack of light by offering a completely black version of the poster.This effect was achieved using the lithographic printing technique where black ink is injected into high quality 170gsm black Forest Stewardship Council certified paper.The difference between the texture of the printed areas and the unprinted areas of the paper means that the image changes according to the lighting in the room and the angle you view it from.The poster comes with an A5 card explaining the significance and scientific method behind the discovery.

Il mio lavoro è un omaggio alla mia terra e a quei riti che scandiscono il tempo sacro e profano di una socialità popolare, tra sagre, processioni, prospetti barocchi, giostre, lustrini, edicole votive, insegne strobo ed altarini accesi.La mia attenzione quando produco o penso un’opera, parte da quella che è la tradizione. La terra in cui vivo. Io vivo in Sicilia, a Palermo una città che ti da molto, ma che allo stesso tempo ti chiede molto. In questa città prendo ispirazione per tutto quello che penso e produco, per le mie installazioni, per le mie sculture, che coniugano artigianato e tradizione. Cioè, cerco di rendere un linguaggio tradizionale in un linguaggio internazionale.Una Sicilia, mare di luce per LampedusaLa Sicilia, la cui forma richiama proprio la mia isola che si illumina, l’ho ripensata per Lampedusa perché andando a Lampedusa ho fatto un viaggio al contrario. Ho percorso la rotta che fanno i viaggiatori, ma anche gli immigrati dal mare. I migranti che arrivano dal mare vedono con speranza la luce della costa siciliana, il mare è per loro un mezzo di salvezza e nel mare molti perdono la vita.Ho pensato a una luce da raggiungere, ma ad una luce che non ha una forma ben precisa. È una via di salvezza nel buio totale della navigazione. Ho come immaginato chi non è riuscito ad arrivare a questa luce, ma se l’è portata dietro. È come se fosse rimasta nella retina dell’occhio l’ultima immagine: la luce della mia terra, la luce della Sicilia.La mia Sicilia è un atto d’amore alla terra, al cielo, al mare, alla sua gente. Immersa, l’opera diventa un segreto, celato agli occhi, incastonato nel pensiero.Ho come immaginato chi non è riuscito ad arrivare a questa luce, ma se l’è portata dietro, un simbolo dal forte impatto emotivo che confonde l'arte e la cronaca.Cosmogonia Mediterranea, siamo tutti migrantiCosmogoniaMediterranea è il viaggio dell’isola mare di luce, come se l’opera fosse un viaggiatore che si ricarica da luoghi, da persone che incontra, immagazzinando sapere e culture.L’energia dalla quale viene contaminata le consente di ricaricarsi e di completare il suo viaggio ritornando a Lampedusa. Il viaggio è iniziato a Lampedusa, nel luglio 2016, nei fondali di Cala Francese è stata adagiata l’opera, questa installazione temporanea ha consentito la realizzazione del video-racconto dal titolo #cosmogoniamediterranea.Le tappe del suo viaggio, prima di ritornare nelle acque di Lampedusa, sono stati i luoghi d’arte, gli spazi propulsori di vita e innovazione artistica.

Con il vostro aiutoCon il vostro aiuto realizzerò l’ultima tappa di quest’anno, riportare l’isola sul fondo del mare di Lampedusa per due mesi dal 29 luglio al 30 settembre, renderla visibile e visitabile. Sarà sistemata a Cala Francese in un fondo sabbioso tra la poseidonia, sto organizzando un bagno purificatore che vorrebbe vedere coinvolti tutti i residenti dell’isola, insieme ai turisti e ai migranti in transito, ospiti temporanei del centro accoglienza.I'm a lighthouseAlla fine della sua esposizione sollevarla dal fondo ed esporla in modo permanente al porto di Lampedusa, nel punto dove attraccano le imbarcazioni dei soccorritori.Le vostre donazioni serviranno a coprire le spese di questa parte finale del viaggio della mia Sicilia e se supereremo il budget i fondi saranno impiegati nella progettazione e realizzazione delle prossime tappe : Grecia e Spagna.Si tratta di una operazione complessa che combina arte e tecnologia, luci a led, 4 metri di metallo zincato, piena di piccole luci (luminarie) che brillano sotto il mare.Ho bisogno del tuo aiuto per proseguire il mio viaggio.RingraziamentiHo pensato di ringraziarvi inviando a ciascuno di voi un dono, un simbolo, un oggetto che diventa anch’esso testimone della mia denuncia.Le frasi stampate nelle t-shirt gridano accoglienza, amore, speranza.Adottando una lampadina contribuirete ad accendere la mia Sicilia, mare di luce e riceverete una copia della lampadina con una base in legno dipinta a mano.Edizione limitataNel mio percorso artistico la Sicilia di luminarie è nata prima del mio viaggio migrante ed è realizzata in legno, con la tecnica della pittura del carretto siciliano unendo la tecnica delle luminarie delle feste patronali.Questa opera viene ripensata in edizione limitata, una Sicilia per Lampedusa con il cuore blu, disponibile in due dimensioni:larghezza 150 cmlarghezza 200 cm Grazia al tuo supportoRiuscirò a coprire i costi stimati per la realizzazione di questa ultima fase, a sistemare l'opera sotto l'acqua per due mesi e a donare l'opera all'isola di Lampedusa.

<li>I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B. of Architecture in 2015 and will be starting my master's degree in architecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the fall.

To create the full-fledged vision of our piece we would like to use dichroic film, which is quite costly, but very powerful in creating multi-colored shadows, and very dynamic diffraction patterns which we are seeking.
We would also like to incorporate responsive sensors and components which would be run off of an Arduino to create a more intimate and personal experience for users.

<h3>The Meatstick</h3>
<p>We've all said to ourselves at one point or another, ""Dildos are great, but what could make them better?""  Well, this is a question that has echoed throughout the annals of time, but finally, after centuries of innovation, we have come up with the ultimate answer: Put donut shapes on the dildo!</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Brentcat.  I'm an artist and designer based out of Denver, Colorado, and I am so incredibly proud to introduce to you the pinnacle of my life work: The Meatstick!  </p>
<p>This has been a labor of love for me.  Years of extensive research and development have gone into this.  Designs were carefully worked over, each perfected to the most minute detail, and then discarded without a second thought.  Model after model was meticulously tested in laboratory environments, searching for that perfect combination of width and girth, and dildo and donut. Today, I am proud to share with you the fruits of my labor.</p>
<p>The Mona Lisa.  The Taj Mahal.  The Sistine Chapel.  The Meatstick.  It is such a great honor for me to be able to share with you my gift to the world.  Masterpieces come around once an era.  This is that masterpiece.<br/><br/>These are professionally made dildos, crafted out of high end medical silicone.  They are soft to the touch, and wobble in the breeze.  These are, quite literally, the finest dildo materials available.  You are paying for quality.  They are 7.9"" by 1.4"", and weigh about 3/4 of a pound.  They are sturdy, and could seriously injure someone if you were to smack them in the face with it.  They'll leave a hell of a mushroom stamp.  And, of course, they are decorated with a donut pattern, which has been dyed into the silicone.  These are FDA approved, and perfectly safe for human insertion.  These are a novelty item, but rest assured, they are quality dildos, meant to be used.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first manufacturing order has already been placed.  But The Meatstick will sell out.  What we need is some cash flow to keep those dildos flopping in our happy customers hands, and have enough ready for Dicks in September! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first order is already in production!  The second has already been placed!  The biggest issue will be communicating with the Chinese manufacturers, and keeping merchandise in stock.</p>
<p>Like life, nothing is perfect.  While we will try and get the pattern as close to perfect as possible, these are done by hand, in bulk.  Some variations will occur.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is some silly shit.  There's no denying that.  If it made you laugh, but you don't want to purchase the Meatstick, or any of the other penis inspired rewards, please just share this campaign!  Every share helps make the dream become a reality!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i></h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Thea Wirsching and I have a PhD in American literature.  I'm also an astrologer, ordained priestess, and general practitioner of the Hermetic arts, and I've combined my two loves (literature and magic) into a Tarot deck about nineteenth-century American writers.   </p>
<p>I was so lucky to find the amazingly talented artist Celeste Pille to illustrate my vision, and since contracting with her she has completed thirty Tarot card images, almost forty percent of the project!  But a standard Tarot deck contains seventy-eight unique images, and so we have a long road ahead in terms of compensating the artist for her time, skill, and care in attending to the rich detail that goes into each image.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where the money will go</h3>
<p>Our goal of $3,900 reflects Celeste's fee per image and the forty-eight cards that remain to be illustrated (plus the percentage of the campaign that goes to Indiegogo, and our cost for prints and postage).  Even if we do not reach our goal, any money we receive will contribute directly to the completion of the project.  Once Celeste has completed all seventy-eight images for <i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i>, we will seek representation by a publisher or begin the process of self-publishing the deck.  <i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i> will ultimately become a physical deck of cards with accompanying book (already written by me) about the thirty-six writers included in the project.      </p>
</div><h3> </h3><h3>Why this project is important</h3><p>Believe it or not, no Tarot deck about American history has ever been attempted before.  <i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i> yokes the compelling history of the Civil War and slavery's abolition with the intricacies of America's first literary renaissance.  By telling these interrelated stories of mid-nineteenth century America with striking images and potent symbolism, I believe we can introduce a wide audience to America's deep traditions of political activism, social consciousness-raising, philosophical inquiry, and metaphysical experimentation.  As a culturally inclusive deck celebrating particularly American forms of syncretism, <i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i> aims to reflect the liberal values that have always been a feature of our shared history.   </p><p> </p><h3>Other ways you can help</h3><p>If you are intrigued by the project but are unable to make a contribution today, we ask that you please support us by liking our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/The-American-Renaissance-Tarot-1741999706090989/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> page and sharing our content widely.  You can view additional images from <i>The American Renaissance Tarot</i> on Facebook and also at our website, <a href=""https://www.americanrenaissancetarot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.americanrenaissancetarot.com</a>.  We will keep you up to date on our progress with regular blog postings, and we will continue to share select Tarot images as they are created.  Your support is a key factor in showing publishers that there is a demand for a culturally informed and visually exciting project such as this.</p><p>Thanks for reading.  We're so happy you're here.</p><p>Thea and Celeste</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491191604/dskomi3zz9no25deiqjh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","The American Renaissance Tarot

 Why this project is importantBelieve it or not, no Tarot deck about American history has ever been attempted before.  The American Renaissance Tarot yokes the compelling history of the Civil War and slavery's abolition with the intricacies of America's first literary renaissance.  By telling these interrelated stories of mid-nineteenth century America with striking images and potent symbolism, I believe we can introduce a wide audience to America's deep traditions of political activism, social consciousness-raising, philosophical inquiry, and metaphysical experimentation.  As a culturally inclusive deck celebrating particularly American forms of syncretism, The American Renaissance Tarot aims to reflect the liberal values that have always been a feature of our shared history.    Other ways you can helpIf you are intrigued by the project but are unable to make a contribution today, we ask that you please support us by liking our Facebook page and sharing our content widely.  You can view additional images from The American Renaissance Tarot on Facebook and also at our website, www.americanrenaissancetarot.com.  We will keep you up to date on our progress with regular blog postings, and we will continue to share select Tarot images as they are created.  Your support is a key factor in showing publishers that there is a demand for a culturally informed and visually exciting project such as this.Thanks for reading.  We're so happy you're here.Thea and Celeste",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Word to Image - Musings on the Hebrew Alphabet</h3>
<p>We live in a time when spiritual awareness is more important than it has ever been. </p>
<p>""A bit of mystery, a bit of magic, a lot of mystical power melded to produce the Hebrew alphabet.""</p>
<p>While learning the Hebrew alphabet, Woodstock Artist and Writer Renee Englander came to see the unique relationship between each Hebrew letter and their deeper kabbalistic meanings.</p>
<p>She created <strong>Word to Image</strong>'s  gallery-quality paintings and then added her inspired haiku, to illustrate and inspire a deep understanding of their messages for us, and this beautiful book was born. We could not be more proud to share this project with the world.</p>
<p>Renee has decided to self-publish, so this pre-sale is designed help raise the funds needed for printing, production and distribution, while offering supporters the chance to purchase copies of Word to Image and  and at a discount. Additionally, this is the first ever opportunity for our supporters to directly purchase fine art prints, merchandise, and original paintings.</p>
<p>Support us, and be a part of the <strong>Word to Image</strong> project -- we would love to have you with us as we cross the finish line!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will we do with the funds raised?</h3>
<p>Publishing a book is an epic journey! For Word to Image, it began with an idea and then a very small printing of 25 prototypes. Renee immediately had to print more, just to meet local demand. The book has been created, and now we need help, to share its wisdom with the world.</p>
<p>The funding through this campaign covers the high-quality production of this book in paper and hardbound editions as well as complimentary art projects, but your involvement with our campaign will produce more than a book or art prints. The Hebrew alphabet's timeless wisdom is something you will absorb, treasure, and share with others. It is our goal to get this book into the hands of Jewish women and Hebrew students who might not otherwise find it, and to aid and enhance their lessons and learning of the materials.</p>

<h3>Short Summary<br/> </h3>
<p>My name is Annalee Beer. I am an artist and designer living in Brisbane, Australia. I began my creative career in a serious way in 2015 after a period of cripping PTSD led me to a place where I couldn't work in a traditional format. Ever since then I have been working very seriously to turn my creative endeavours into an income. </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign you are supporting a disabled artist to live an independant creative life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It will cost me a good amount of money to host a solid exhibition. $1300 is planned for renting an exhibition space. $600 is required to get prints made of my work. A further $800 is for physical supplies and tools for art creation. The additional funds will help me to pay for catering, printing invitations and marketing. The exhibition will take place in November 2020.</p>
<p>Everybody who supports this campaign will receive some art - in one form or another. Every donation above $5 is eligible to receive a unique piece of art from my Brisbane City Postcard series. To be clear, the pictures attached to the backer rewards are samples of past postcards. Each postcard sent for this campaign will be a new and unique image.</p>
<p>It is my plan to go ahead with the exhibition, whether or not I make all of the money in this campaign. It would just require a very slow process of saving my income.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It would mean an awful lot to me to receive help to reach this goal. Creating a career as a fine artist is such a hard thing to do, and moving towards a place where I can develop a meaningful career creating fine art would change my life in a major way. <br/><br/>It will also contribute to the art scene in Brisbane, Australia.</p>

<h3>Political Stencil</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are “Political Stencil”, a team of artists and activists, active in the urban landscapes of Athens and abroad.</p>
<p>Commentating is our force of action. We keep our focus on sociopolitical issues and actively engage in bashing fascist, sexist and racist views. We stand against austerity policies and any form of state repression.</p>
<p>It is the political and social momentum that moves us. Each case and incident we choose to act upon is individual and in some form mirrors issues deeply rooted in our society.</p>
<p>Our revenues come solely from our work. Our first, self-published edition brought us up to here. Now we are trying to collect the funds for our second, enhanced edition which will contain five years of our work.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/>We need the funding in order to print our five-year,  limited edition publication.<br/>We are planning to sell this publication so we can keep financing our project and remain independent from the need of receiving funds that will put our freedom of expression into risk.</p>
<p>Selling our books is our only means of financing and we ask for your help to keep going.</p>
<p>In order to support our campaign, you can either preorder our catalogue or purchase a handmade T-shirt, stenciled with one of our works.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Humor, sarcasm, exaggeration and linguistic distortion are our tools against mass media propaganda. Officially we are vandals, since unauthorized graffiti is characterized as such. We accept the term and insist with what we do but we retain the notion that we are vandals with a certain air and an opinion that is worth to be heard.</p>

<h3>About the Artists</h3>
<p><strong>Morag Myersough &amp; Luke Morgan X Ilukuluku. </strong></p>
<p>Created exclusively for Afrika Burn 2019 by UK based Morag Myerscough and Luke Morgan who are known around the world for their distinct approach to making large scaffold structures adorned with neon geometric patterns and shapes, often incorporating positive messaging hand painted onto plywood. Their recent work includes ""Embrace the Unknown"" 2018 Cape Town, the Temple of Agape London 2014 and the Movement Café London 2012.</p>
<p>Morag’s mantra is ‘make happy those who are near and those who are far will come’. Morag has always been fascinated by how words, colour, pattern and structures can change environments and people’s perceptions of spaces into places. Luke is a non-conformist maverick inventor. His kinetic sculptures stem from a fascination with the way machines work and a deep love for rock n roll music and devotee of 50s aesthetic.</p>
<h3>About the Ilukuluku Tribe</h3>
<ul><li>In its fourth year, the 40 strong tribe crew has formed a collective of talented creative individuals who are all working together to see this vision come to life. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">ILUKULUKU is registered collective, endorsed by AfrikaBurn. They are supported by a great number of tribe, friends and proud default world sponsors. Each and every one of them has committed to realising the vision of enhancing the effectiveness of Tankwa Town. Guided by the organisation’s 11 guiding principles, they uphold the ethos of the ‘Burner’ community and culture.</span>
</li></ul>

</div><div>
<h3>About the Ilukuluku Temple of Curiosity:</h3>
<p>“The ILUKULUKU Temple of Curiosity aims to stimulate your curiosity and will offer an array of activities, interactions, performances and curious happenings” says Myerscough. “The Temple is a place of belonging. It is bold and proud and will max out your senses, generating specific responses in each individual who experiences the work, creating a community and building identity.”</p>
<h3>What we are raising funds for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are raising funds to cover the material and transportation costs of the art structure including: 8 ton scaffolding, 330 X plywood panels, 550l paint, paint materials and basic operational fees. </li>
<li>We have created unique rewards with our patterns to engage our participants to help us raise the temple off the ground.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are not going to burn our art structure, we will repurpose all the hand painted plywood panels and refurbish a local community school that burnt down in 2019 and reuse the panels for educational purposes.</p>

Each and every one of them has committed to realising the vision of enhancing the effectiveness of Tankwa Town. Guided by the organisation’s 11 guiding principles, they uphold the ethos of the ‘Burner’ community and culture.

About the Perks
Morag Myerscough & Luke Morgan X Ilukuluku
All our perks features Morag Myerscough and Luke Morgan's custom patterns designed for Ilukuluku.

About the Ilukuluku Temple of Curiosity:
“The ILUKULUKU Temple of Curiosity aims to stimulate your curiosity and will offer an array of activities, interactions, performances and curious happenings” says Myerscough. “The Temple is a place of belonging. It is bold and proud and will max out your senses, generating specific responses in each individual who experiences the work, creating a community and building identity.”
What we are raising funds for:

We are raising funds to cover the material and transportation costs of the art structure including: 8 ton scaffolding, 330 X plywood panels, 550l paint, paint materials and basic operational fees. 
We have created unique rewards with our patterns to engage our participants to help us raise the temple off the ground.


The Impact
We are not going to burn our art structure, we will repurpose all the hand painted plywood panels and refurbish a local community school that burnt down in 2019 and reuse the panels for educational purposes.

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p>Hey there! My name is Alec Vaughan, and I have been wood crafting for a few months now. I have always had a knack for the creative, and have many years experience as a 3D artist. When quarantine happened I was furloughed from my job, and with nothing to do I decided to take on a hobby. I would have never guessed that this little hobby of mine would take off like it has. I bought a small lathe and already had some tools at my disposal and just started to carve, cut, sand, and turn out some wood. </p>
<p>My campaign has a simple idea in mind. Getting <i><strong>exposure </strong></i>as a small business and in turn providing a product that you will own that is unique and true to you. I want to create a large order through the Indiegogo platform to help boost my small business. This is super important to me because my passion is to get this business started and you will be helping me achieve that goal!</p>
<p>As a contributor to my campaign, not only will you be helping me upgrade my tools and help my business grow, but you'll be able to take home one of my products for yourself depending on what perk you decide to go for!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get:</h3>
<p>Where does the money go?</p>
<ul>
<li>Wood Supply (Exotic and Natural Woods)</li>

<li>Dust Collector (For my health)</li>

</ul>
<p>What are you going to get in return?</p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact You'll Make on My Life</h3>
<p>Every product I design is hand made. I do not mass produce anything so you will know that time and dedication will be going into each piece of work. My product is something that will last for years to come.</p>
<p>I have already made dozens of products for people and so far, everyone has loved my work. I'm confident that my product will make you happy in the end!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk I'm taking here is potentially getting a very large business order that may look overwhelming at first since I normally have only one or two projects moving at one time. Luckily I'm detail oriented and will provide a very accurate time frame to deliver my products to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I realize that right now during these challenging and difficult times, it might be hard to contribute financially to my campaign. Do not fret! There are ways to help out without pledging money to me. You can help by sharing this campaign to friends and family and getting the word out for me. I greatly appreciate anyone that will help me with this campaign!</p>

<p><strong>We perceive the world in terms of solid, tangible objects, but as the physicist Carlo Rovelli eloquently writes, “even the things that are most “thinglike” are nothing more than long events.”</strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with Joseph White</p>
<p><strong><i>YOUR SUPPORT</i></strong></p>
<p>I'm fundraising to sponsor my video / sculpture <i>Everyone Has an Interior Landscape, Except Me</i> to be installed in the Spatial Relations Show at the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition (BWAC)! The piece is opening on September 21  and runs through October 21, 2019.</p>

<ul><li>With your generous contributions, these funds will help me cover the <strong>costs</strong> of the projectors, media players, support structures, paper, <strong>the </strong><strong>installation</strong> as well as <strong>pay my collaborators</strong> who will help transport and install the piece and lend technical assistance.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>A Bit About Me</i></strong></p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I'm a dancer (Juilliard, Bill T. Jones and Arnie Zane, the Jose Limon Company) who went on to choreograph (The Downtown Whitey, MOMA PS/1, The Kitchen, The Cunningham Studio, Dance Theater Workshop).</p>
<p>When my pieces began to incorporate film and photography, I went on to work as a photographer’s assistant (Horst P. Horst, Sheila Metzner) before doing my own photography (Takashimaya, Forbes, Martha Stewart, Cartier).</p>

<ul>
<li>Large sheets of glassine paper, suspended in the space, are loosely attached to guide wires. These sheets form what appear to be two 3-dimensional objects, floating in space.

<p><i><strong>THE VIDEOS</strong></i></p>
<p>The videos were shot in the Great Basin, Utah and Istanbul, Turkey in 2018 and were influenced by Virginia Woolf’s writings about wandering: going out into the world, without a plan, getting lost, gaining a sense of freedom, and seeing what is found- an internal and external landscape. </p>
<p>When I put the video stills up on a wall, and observed them as a collection, I was struck by an underlying, recurrent way I looked at the world around me. It was distinctly a body feminine (tunnels, water, undulating jellies). Even though these videos/ still images were a product of pure happenstance: randomly turning off onto a dirt road in the middle of the desert, the timing of jellyfish collectively mating coinciding with my walking down a dock just outside of Istanbul: what I consistently chose to record had a pattern. When I picked up a camera to document a moment or event, it was the body feminine. My external representation of an internal dialogue. The more I went out into the world, the more I turned the world into me. </p>

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Transforming Totems</strong> stand to make multiple marvelous movements with twists and twinkles. <strong>Transforming Totems’</strong> aim is to create community culture. Stand between them for immediacy, immersion and illumination. The vibrant 11' tall each, triple towers radiate inclusion. They pose as symbols of understated awe, unity of all, and more understanding on the impact of interactive movement art. The Gardens of Xanadu artists are collectively creating these pieces and the art may be seen at Burning Man 2020, as well as permanently placed in beautiful Boise, Idaho.</p>
<p>These pieces are so very important to us because they are community created, allowing anyone who wants to participate, to be a part of them. The pieces are truly dynamic and communal since the creation of them will also allow for changes and additions that individuals might think up and incorporate. As these 3 totem pillars are to be built first, as part of a whole larger project,<strong> Marveling Marvin the Vortexagon</strong>, they will invite people who see them to join in on the creation of the entire project, taking part in learning aspects of building, fundraising, project management, lighting, and interactivity.</p>
<p>The art is a daytime and nighttime display. The 3 <strong>Transforming Totems</strong> and <strong>Marveling Marvin</strong> are to be made of weather proofed &amp; epoxy coated wood squares in repeated and intriguing twists of patterns like vortexes with thousands of LED lights. </p>
<p>The included LED lighting, over time, permits people all over the <i><strong>WORLD</strong></i> to code shows on them and play with the lights.  </p>
<p>Lighting can be made to be sound reactive, as well as reactive to external components, that can be added (fun little gadgets that do things with the lights).  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>Gardens of Xanadu Artists desire your help in raising at least <strong>$9K</strong> to make the initial <strong>TOTEMS</strong> project and then another <strong>$35K</strong> for complete rebuilding of the rest of <strong>MARVELING MARVIN 2.0 </strong>project. The original <strong>MARVIN</strong> was built for and burned as an effigy at <strong>Burning Man</strong> in 2013, but we're ready to bring it back to stay!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;color:#F3461A !important;"">The Impact</h3> <p align=""center""><span>Living in the Bay Area during the ""tech boom"", we've noticed that emerging artists are increasingly finding it harder to support themselves and engage the public. They too are moving out of San Francisco which we believe has a negative effect on the surrounding culture. There's data suggesting that this is happening in other major metro areas across the nation. We discovered that <b>66% of Millennials </b>rely on digital platforms to find events and engage with the arts. ArtSlooth can help. We believe it's our duty to engage the public and
 provide more compelling and intelligent ways to exhibit and support artists. </span></p>

The ArtSlooth team is a small and passionate group. We are a non-profit 501(c)(3) that's focused on working with local artists, galleries, small business owners and curators. 
 
 MissionOur mission is to widen access to local artists by bringing interested parties closer together through our mobile application and live events, We offer an engaging bidding and event experience that motivates both artists and buyers. We do not take a commission on sales which significantly helps reduce pricing barriers.


The Impact Living in the Bay Area during the ""tech boom"", we've noticed that emerging artists are increasingly finding it harder to support themselves and engage the public. They too are moving out of San Francisco which we believe has a negative effect on the surrounding culture. There's data suggesting that this is happening in other major metro areas across the nation. We discovered that 66% of Millennials rely on digital platforms to find events and engage with the arts. ArtSlooth can help. We believe it's our duty to engage the public and
 provide more compelling and intelligent ways to exhibit and support artists. 
KQED and the SF Chronicle have written 
specifically about this topic. See below.Priced Out: San Francisco’s Changing Values and Artist Exodus


Testimonial
“I sold a record number of pieces, and more than 65% sold were above my reserve price. The exposure and event turnout were beyond my expectations.“
-- Jared Leake, Artist
(ArtSlooth event 1.22.2016 @ HeartZilla in San Francisco)

What We NeedWe are seeking initial funding of $5000. These initial funds will go to the following:




 Improving and updating our mobile application and artist web console


 The hosting and marketing of future ArtSlooth shows and events


 Community and Artist outreach

Why these Workshops



*** Sustainability *** 



When we first visited the refugees in Reyhanli, Turkey this past September, our main mission was to film a documentary to shed light on their stories, how and when they fled their hometowns, what happened to them and how they are spending their days now in Turkey. But after running these workshops with them we realized that it could not be a one-time event and that it has to continue for these kids to learn and grow, and to be able to impact them positively we needed to come back and continue working with them. 
*** Creativity,Confidence,Imagination *** 
We  realized that most of the children were keen on learning, curious to explore new things, and there was so much hidden potential waiting to thrive. Fares, from Hama, told us that it's been more than two years since he's held a pen or a paper. Diab, from Idleb, said that he quit school as he needed to work to provide for his family.Diab is eleven years old.These kids, despite all odds were thirsting to partake in our creative workshops and produced beautiful art pieces and compelling stories. They were playful and full of life.  We want to provide for them the tools and resources that will continue fostering their imagination and inspire them to create and learn.
*** Well-Being ***

One thing was clear and that was the kids'  happy state of mind. Though for a little while, the kids were happy to carry out these activities whether it was painting, playing music, puzzles, tug of war, reading poetry or even telling us their stories. At one point, we put Ahmed on the spot and asked him what he was feeling in that moment. He replied I am imagining my wedding in this hall. That is how happy he was to be in that place. And we want to create that effect again; that is why we decided to launch this campaign.

On the 21st of November 2014, a group of filmmakers and cultural workers entered this legendary cinema and began screening films for free for the citizens of Belgrade.<p>The building is in need of completely new electrical installations and new water supply pipes. The roof needs repairing and the heating system needs to be enabled. This is essential in order to resume the original function of Zvezda Cinema. We are looking forward to open a new chapter in the artistic expression of young Serbia. We would like to expand the potential of cinemas as a mediator between creation and audience, by developing them into authentic cultural centers that provide essential cultural information and a profound experience for the ever-inspired individuals.</p><h1><i>History</i></h1><p>Zvezda Cinema is a historical monument and by that is under the protection of The Council of Conservation of Monuments. It was the atelier of the early Serbian photographer Milan Jovanovic. The building was erected in 1890 and in 1911 it became the ""Koloseum Cinema"". Upon the end of World War II in 1945, and the arrival of socialism, it became a state-owned cinema and its name was changed to “Zvezda” (Star).</p><h1><b><i>Recent History</i></b></h1><p>Up until 2004, Belgrade had 19 active cinemas with an annual visit of 4.200.00 people. The company ""Beograd Film"" and its network of 14 cinemas in the city had a 78% of the overall visits. In 2007 ""Beograd Film"" was privatized under suspicious circumstances for the mere sum of 9.2 million EUR. Previous to that, its market value was estimated to 60 million EUR. Despite being bound by law to maintain the cinema's main activity for the next two years, the new owner sold five of the cinema venues to a supermarket chain for 19.7 million EUR the next year.</p><p>By doing this, the government, the privatization agency and the new owner had damaged the cultural infrastructure of Serbia. Irreparable damage has been done to Serbian filmmaking through the process of privatization of “Beograd Film”. This also carries harmful consequences for the economy and culture of the city and the country. For the first time ever in its 80-year-long tradition, the survival of Serbian cinema was endangered. Without culture, the identity of a country ceases to exist.</p><p>On the 21st of November, a group of students, film and cultural workers, occupied the Zvezda Cinema. The occupation has been active for a month and a half so far. The event has been reported by the majority of local media, as well as world media, and has been embraced by the public opinion.</p><h1><i>Who are we?</i></h1><p>We are a group of citizens - professional and amateur filmmakers, actresses and actors, photographers, producers, architects, film critics, designers, art directors, curators, veterinarians, moviegoers. Some already established, others still students. Mostly in our twenties, but not exclusively - certainly all young at heart and enthusiastic, and that's what counts. We are a mixture of people of different ages, interests and professions, all united as film lovers and cultural activists. We call to all those who don't want to live in a city without cinemas to join us.</p><h1><i>What will the money be spent on?</i></h1><p>The funding collected from the campaign will be invested in the essential construction work that needs to be done so that the New Zvezda Cinema can function without major obstacles. Several rooftop elements still need to be replaced in order to stop all water leaks. The heating and air vent systems need to be cleaned and revitalized. New electrical installations are required, among with major plumbing work regarding the water-supply system. Those are our priorities.</p><p>If we are able to collect funds that enable us to successfully do all the reparations the building needs, we will invest the remaining money in fixing doors and windows, and/or buying new equipment for the cinema.</p><h1><i><b>Hope and Aim</b></i></h1><p>The vital act of the occupation of Zvezda Cinema has started a humble revolution of independent cinema in Serbia. The lack of cinemas that aren't purely profit driven caused a lack of diversity in Belgrade's cultural and film environment. The audience was seriously deprived by this absence of meaningful content. They may not be aware of what caused this, but they are starving for fresh, new and different cinematic and cultural perspectives.</p><p>As the saying goes - ""Where there's a will, there's a way"". We are looking forward to create a cultural center inside of the Zvezda Cinema, a center for the already ripe intellectuals and the upcoming youth that have so much to give. We do not want to blame anyone or anything, or stay forever without taking matters into our own hands and doing the best we can. We want to shine a light on the current situation. November 21st marks the beginning of a very bright future and the New Zvezda Cinema has a shimmery, wonderful artistic one!</p><p>We hope to bring the building to its full function and more. Slowly but steadily, we want to create a base that will support the bright future of the art of cinema in Serbia and this part of Europe.</p><p>Please, support this project. <br/>You can be a part of a positive approach to culture.</p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Zvezda Cinema will be renovated without the guarantee of it working as a cinema, as there's a parallel legal battle going on - however, it will most likely last for years. The desired outcome is for Zvezda to become a publicly owned center. We want to save cinema and this particular cinema from ruin.</p><br/></div>","New Zvezda CinemaThe building of Zvezda Cinema is in need of repairs to resume its essential function and develop into an authentic cultural center.The building of Zvezda Cinema, one of the oldest European cinemas, has been abandoned and destroyed.

The lack of cinemas that aren't purely profit driven caused a lack of diversity in Belgrade's cultural and film environment. The audience was seriously deprived by this absence of meaningful content. They may not be aware of what caused this, but they are starving for fresh, new and different cinematic and cultural perspectives.As the saying goes - ""Where there's a will, there's a way"". We are looking forward to create a cultural center inside of the Zvezda Cinema, a center for the already ripe intellectuals and the upcoming youth that have so much to give. We do not want to blame anyone or anything, or stay forever without taking matters into our own hands and doing the best we can. We want to shine a light on the current situation. November 21st marks the beginning of a very bright future and the New Zvezda Cinema has a shimmery, wonderful artistic one!We hope to bring the building to its full function and more. Slowly but steadily, we want to create a base that will support the bright future of the art of cinema in Serbia and this part of Europe.Please, support this project. You can be a part of a positive approach to culture.Risks and challengesZvezda Cinema will be renovated without the guarantee of it working as a cinema, as there's a parallel legal battle going on - however, it will most likely last for years. The desired outcome is for Zvezda to become a publicly owned center. We want to save cinema and this particular cinema from ruin.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Association, it has just received a zoning overlay designation as an

artist you may have never heard of.  Before Katrina in 2005, he employed over 25 artists in his New Orleans studio
designing and building restaurant interiors.   Today, his designs and craftsmanship can be seen in many upscale Crescent City venues such as Emeril's,
Nola's, K. Paul's, Red Fish and others.  Quite a bit of Luis's art appears in movies starring Sylvester Stallone, Seth Rogan and others.  Then, in the blink of an eye New Orleans was flooded
 after Hurricane Katrina .  When the water receded, Luis metal art studio was destroyed, his equipment missing and his artists
scattered.  Then a mere 5-years later a BP Oil platform exploded and burned in the Gulf of Mexico.  With these back to back catastrophes, the economy of southern Louisiana was destroyed causing the demand for art to dry up overnight.  </span></p>

<strong>THAT BANDAGED LEFT ARM  </strong>Less than a year after the hand accident, misfortune struck Luis again for the second time.  While stopped at a red light of Claiborne Avenue, Luis' truck was struck from behind by a car traveling at high speed.  The impact thrust him forward, causing his seatbelt to exert great pressure against Luis' left shoulder.  After enduring several months of excruciating pain, he went in for surgery to repair his damaged rotator cup.  After the repair of a 12-inch tear, Luis was left with 26 stiches and his arm in a sling.  Again, d<span style=""background-color: initial;"">espite the severity of his wound, Luis forged ahead with completing his obligation, commissioned by the St. Bernard Parish ""CY  PRES Committee"".  Compare the photo above to the one below and you will discover that up top, Luis has his right arm in a white sling versus below, where his left arm is in a sling of a different color.</span><div>

<p><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">The commission to sculp PASO FINO was one of the most amusing observations I've had of my client, Luis Colmenares.  A well known Chalmette attorney has a passionate love for the Paso Fino breed and wanted a sculpture created.  I happened to have over-heard the attorney's inquiries about Luis's ability to take on the task.  He asked Luis, ""have you ever sculpted a horse before?"".  Luis's answered ""No! But I bought a book on horses, and I've visited a friends farm to see his horses!  It was all that I could do to keep from laughing as he reminded me of a popular television commercial.  In the end, the sculpting of Paso Fino was a true work of art which enabled Luis to stand out among his peers. </strong></p>

<div>The only time I was ever indoubt about Luis's ability to deliver a project on time was in the sculpting of this mascot for <a href=""https://youtu.be/PiR3K6tJO1E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Christian Brothers School""</a>.  Each and every feather had to be cut with a plasma torch, shaped, bent, chisled, welded and buffed. Then, on the night before it was to be delivered, the commissioner of the falcon said that she wanted to cancel the project.  Its beek did not look anything like she was anticipating.  Luis reassured the client that he'd rework the beek.  Undetered, Luis removed, reworked and completed a new beek for the falcon by 8:AM the next morning .  Even as the bird was being loaded into the van for transporting, he was still sculpting, bending and tweeking to get it perfect.  This project more than any other taught me that Luis Colmenares produces at his very best when he is under the extreme stress of an approaching deadline.   </div>

<p><b>SCULPTURE OF FOAM</b><br/></p>
<p>A client commissioned a wearable costume inspired by the late artist Georgia O'Keeffe. There is no denying that Georgia’s flower paintings helped to perpetuated the belief about women artists as flower painters.  Though it is easy to view a suggestions of the female sex organ among her paintings, Georgia vehemently denied an association of the female anatomy with her beautiful flowers paintings. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> None the less, Georgia exploited long-standing gender associations with flowers and helped to recast the genre. In the process, Georgia O'Keeffe enabled herself to be seen as an uninhibited “modern” woman and vanguard artist.   Luis Colmenares's Foam art was worn at a recent ball in New Orleans and was said to have been the center of attention.</span></p>

artist you may have never heard of.  Before Katrina in 2005, he employed over 25 artists in his New Orleans studio
designing and building restaurant interiors.   Today, his designs and craftsmanship can be seen in many upscale Crescent City venues such as Emeril's,
Nola's, K. Paul's, Red Fish and others.  Quite a bit of Luis's art appears in movies starring Sylvester Stallone, Seth Rogan and others.  Then, in the blink of an eye New Orleans was flooded
 after Hurricane Katrina .  When the water receded, Luis metal art studio was destroyed, his equipment missing and his artists
scattered.  Then a mere 5-years later a BP Oil platform exploded and burned in the Gulf of Mexico.  With these back to back catastrophes, the economy of southern Louisiana was destroyed causing the demand for art to dry up overnight.  
                       Luis' TV Documentary with George Mason University
Over ten years have now passed and there are still thousands of businesses throughout the region who are still left un-whole.  Though they may have survived, the unbearable wounds inflicted upon them by the flood has prevented them from coming anywhere close to their former selves. 

Every year Luis Colmenares contributes many thousands of dollars worth of art to causes such as the annual WHITNEY ZOO-TO-DO fundraiser for Audubon Zoo . This year will be 29th year that Luis has donated as many as 50 pieces per annual event.
The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to help undo the damage inflicted upon Luis Colmenares by returning him to his own ""metal art studio"". 
You can help by selecting one or more gifts in exchange for your contribution.   Even more importantly, help spread the word about this funding campaign to encourage others to come and contribute as well.  


After so many years of contributing art to worthy causes, it's time  to give back to Luis.  Help make this campaign the great success it can be.  Contribute to this campaign and together we can return Luis to his very own Metal Art Studio.

WHAT IS NEEDED  This campaign is set with the goal of raising two hundred thousand dollars, which is an amount adequate to buy the facility we want to acquire.  Our ultimate wish is to raise twice that amount to enable the purchase of the building and to perform a complete structural
upgrade of the facility.  That amount would also allow the complete outfitting of the building with all new equipment and supplies as well.  This is very necessary because, like his Miller 185 welding machines (which was submerged by Katrina flood waters), every piece of equipment was wetted.  They all are far beyond their serviceable lifespans.  


MASTERS ART RETREAT SCHOOL Should this campaign go viral and become
wildly successful, we'll use funds to create a resident Art Masters Retreat School. Seasoned artists will spend up to five days learning under the direction of Luis Colmenares. These students will receive hands-on training in all aspect of unconventional art creation in the use of stainless-steel, canvas, foam and other esoteric materials.  They will use the Plasma torch and Welding tips as paint brushs upon various metals as their canvas.  We will establish a scholarship award so that every class will include one student who, otherwise, might not be able to afford to participate. CLICK HERE TO VISIT ART METAL STUDIO



GIFTS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS We have an amazing collection of unique gifts to choose from in exchange for your contributions.  You simply choose one or more items from Luis' wide selection of art inspired gifts.  For the serious art collector, there is even a couple of original Bleudreaux prototype paintings that are signed and dated.  They will one day become very valuable because, 2016 is going to be remembered as the year that Bleudreaux, the blue Crawfish, made his debut.

LUIS COLMENARES


ABOUT THE ARTIST, LUIS COLMENARES  
If
you have ever had an opportunity to chat with Luis, you will quickly discovered that
few artists anywhere in the world can match his eclecticism and artistic output.  A good example would be the 2015 Whitney ""Zoo-To-do"" at Audubon Zoo--for which he designed, fabricated, delivered
and set up over 50 unique pieces of Art.  The zoo's four
signature art pieces were each 15 feet tall above the water, and three feet below in the elephant pool. 
BIOGRAPHY  The success
of this crowd funding campaign will also enable the research and writing of his biography as a coffee
tabletop picture book chronicling the amazing Life and Art of Luis Colmenares. 

                                                               *******

THE BIRTH OF A BLEUDREAUX The typical image of an artist while painting is perhaps the one featuring him or her standing, or sometimes seated before an easel.  Of Luis however, you'll almost always find him seated comfortably on his overstuffed sofa with two large pillows for back support.  Invariably, the television will be tuned in to some abstract program.  Peeking over Luis' shoulder while he is working is an exciting opportunity to witness the birth of some of the most incredible art projects ever.  Here we find him Luis putting the finishing touches on ""Mardi Gras 2016"", the largest Bleudreaux ever at over six feet tall.                                                                     


MARDI GRAS 2016

BLEUDEAUX'S ""Bayou All-Stars"" Band

THAT BANDAGED HAND                                                                In the closing day of completing the Challmette Hurricane Katrina Sculpture, Luis experienced the first of two potentially career-ending accidents.  He walked a bit too closely to the razor sharp edge of a piece of stainless steel and cut tendons in his right hand.  Despite the severity of his wound, he pressed ahead with completing the ""Will Power Park"" Memorial Sculpture in time for the August 29th dedication.  



Annually, Luis makes trophies for the ""New Orleans Track Club's"" Thanksgiving Day Marathon.  Here we see him out lining the shape of a roadrunner upon rolled sheet metal to be cut with a plasma torch.  As you can see, after his accident, Luis had little time for healing because everyone knows, ""Great Art Waits For No One!"". 


SCULPTURE Will Power Park Memorial in Challmette





THAT BANDAGED LEFT ARM  Less than a year after the hand accident, misfortune struck Luis again for the second time.  While stopped at a red light of Claiborne Avenue, Luis' truck was struck from behind by a car traveling at high speed.  The impact thrust him forward, causing his seatbelt to exert great pressure against Luis' left shoulder.  After enduring several months of excruciating pain, he went in for surgery to repair his damaged rotator cup.  After the repair of a 12-inch tear, Luis was left with 26 stiches and his arm in a sling.  Again, despite the severity of his wound, Luis forged ahead with completing his obligation, commissioned by the St. Bernard Parish ""CY  PRES Committee"".  Compare the photo above to the one below and you will discover that up top, Luis has his right arm in a white sling versus below, where his left arm is in a sling of a different color.
  





Two weeks following Luis' rotator-cup surgery, he was commissioned to create this piece for Kim Bullock as a gift for celebrity businessman Paul Michell.  Despite excruciating pain from the operation, Luis delivered the Bleudreaux on time.  If you look closely, you might see a hint of a smile that I coaxed out of Luis for this photo. 
PAUL MITCHELL




Luis first commission immediately after his rotatorcup sugery, was to create a piece of art for Kim, a former intern of Luis and family friend.  The art piece was to be a gift for a celebrity businessman, Paul Mitchell, whose prominence arises from the womens beauty industry.  Though the piece lived up to Luis' high standards, it was very obvious that throughout the design and creation of it, he was experiencing a great deal of physical pain and discomfort.  Nonetheless, we were told that Paul Mitchell was ecstatic about his Bleudreaux.

SCULPTURE ""Paso Fino"" 
The commission to sculp PASO FINO was one of the most amusing observations I've had of my client, Luis Colmenares.  A well known Chalmette attorney has a passionate love for the Paso Fino breed and wanted a sculpture created.  I happened to have over-heard the attorney's inquiries about Luis's ability to take on the task.  He asked Luis, ""have you ever sculpted a horse before?"".  Luis's answered ""No! But I bought a book on horses, and I've visited a friends farm to see his horses!  It was all that I could do to keep from laughing as he reminded me of a popular television commercial.  In the end, the sculpting of Paso Fino was a true work of art which enabled Luis to stand out among his peers. 






SCULPTURE Christian Brothers School Falcon


The only time I was ever indoubt about Luis's ability to deliver a project on time was in the sculpting of this mascot for ""Christian Brothers School"".  Each and every feather had to be cut with a plasma torch, shaped, bent, chisled, welded and buffed. Then, on the night before it was to be delivered, the commissioner of the falcon said that she wanted to cancel the project.  Its beek did not look anything like she was anticipating.  Luis reassured the client that he'd rework the beek.  Undetered, Luis removed, reworked and completed a new beek for the falcon by 8:AM the next morning .  Even as the bird was being loaded into the van for transporting, he was still sculpting, bending and tweeking to get it perfect.  This project more than any other taught me that Luis Colmenares produces at his very best when he is under the extreme stress of an approaching deadline.   








SCULPTURE OF FOAM
A client commissioned a wearable costume inspired by the late artist Georgia O'Keeffe. There is no denying that Georgia’s flower paintings helped to perpetuated the belief about women artists as flower painters.  Though it is easy to view a suggestions of the female sex organ among her paintings, Georgia vehemently denied an association of the female anatomy with her beautiful flowers paintings.  None the less, Georgia exploited long-standing gender associations with flowers and helped to recast the genre. In the process, Georgia O'Keeffe enabled herself to be seen as an uninhibited “modern” woman and vanguard artist.   Luis Colmenares's Foam art was worn at a recent ball in New Orleans and was said to have been the center of attention.

INTUIT'S 2015 TURBO-TAX television commercial featured the art work of Luis Colmenares.  ""Carl Mack Presents"" commissioned Luis to furnish two colonial era costumes for an Intuit Turbo-Tax TV commercial. The backdrop for the shoot setting was a typical Mardi Gras scene. The filming was completed in time for the broadcasting in the latter part of January 2015.  To view Intuit's commercial, visit this link:  CLICK HERE TO VIEW COMMERCIAL!

Four or five days following the accident.                                                                    A little less than two months ago, Emma, Luis' younger of two daughters was injured in an accident.  Though it could had been far more serious, she was blessed and she is recovering very well.  However, Emma has some very high hurdles to climb on the road to complete recovery.  Luis and the Colmenares family would like to thank you for your prayers, well wishes and support.

                      A METAL ART FACILITY FOR LUIS COLMENARES  

The goal of this campaign is to buy, rehabilitate and equip an industrial grade building  for Luis Colmenares.  It will serve as his art metal construction facility and art studio. The upgrade of the facility includes residential area to temporarily house students who visit to participate in Luis' Art Retreats and Boot Camps.

MIKHALA IVERSEN  We owe so much to ""Team Bleudreaux"" member Mikhala Iversen.  It is her voice that is heard singing background on his videos.  I especially enjoy listening to Mikhala sing Bleudreaux's theme songs, ""Squeeze Me"" & ""Nature Boy"".  To you Mikhala, we owe a debt of gratutude.  Thank you, Allen Kimble     



Mikhala as an infant upon the arm of the late, great LOUIS ARMSTRONG.  Her mother was a profession jazz singer from Minneapolis, and father, a Danish lover of the jazz.  Mikhala's home in her native Copenhagen was a favored stop-over for many of the Jazz greats who were touring Europe.  
Inspired by her up close and personal association with so many jazz greats, Mikhala was destined to come to New Orleans to sing Jazz.  We are very happy to have her Iversen as the voice ""Team Bleudreaux"".  To hear hear Mikhala Iversen sing Bleudreaux's theme song ""Squeeze Me"", CLICK HERE!


 Thanks Mikhala!

<h1><b>Why does the Fruit Belt Mural Project need your
help?</b></h1>
<p>Your financial support will
allow us to complete the project. In order to finish the work we have begun in
the Jay Street area we would like to extend the opportunity to more youth from
the neighborhood to join our creative team. We need to cover the cost of their labor,
paint for the large-scale murals, as well as tools and building supplies for the
fruit based garden. We also need to rent construction lifts to safely paint the
murals. The youth will also work to create a website and a volg where they
share their experiences in their own words to keep you connected with their day
to day progress.</p>
<p>It is also our hope to
send the group of young artists to North Philadelphia, PA to experience the
Philly Painting Project where artists Haas and Hahn began the first phase of
the project that has inspired ours. These artists believed in a similar
neighborhood, living and painting side by side with the residents.</p>

<h3>
</h3>
<p>Looking
at a young entrepreneur and artist from the Limpopo province in South Africa,
you may wonder if PitsiRa Ragophala has found a few more hours in a
day. PitsiRa is a BUSY man.  He is creating waves of change
and progress in his home of Johannesburg where he has resided for 7 years. An
inspiration to everyone who comes in contact with him, this young, dynamic,
afrocentric artist proves that nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur he recently started his
own travel company, True Routes Travel and has hosted tours in September 2015
for people traveling to from Brooklyn, New York to South Africa. The next group
from Brooklyn is coming in October 2015. True Routes Travel gives people an
opportunity to choose a route exploring culture that best fits their needs. </p>
<p>PitsiRa teaches yoga, to the community in
Yeoville, as well as judges in Johannesburg High Court and currently a Kemetic Yoga Trainee. He runs a coffee business called Kahawa Club. He hosts monthly
showcases featuring upcoming South African performers, called Spooky Sundays.
He hosts community empowerment programs with
Eboukosini Solutions, called Shabaka Men of Afrika and Afrikan Lunch.  As PitsiRa develops his career, he continues
to nurture young people coming up behind him through a monthly African-
centered entrepreneurship program called Street Academy.</p>
<p>“My life is so fascinating, thanks to God
and angels. True Routes Travel is a company that lops and exposes stories about our heritage and offer people of the world more new knowledge and information about our country  I am so inspired by all musicians. In my style I
merge world rhythms mixing African and Western melodies.  I
have been a yoga practitioner for 7 years and have taught throughout Johannesburg
for 4 years. My style is influenced by African, Indian and Western styles  I call it Rama yoga which focuses on
balancing masculine and feminine energy(yin and yang). .   <br/></p>
<p>While some people may wonder how he is
accomplishing so much, in such a short time, PitsiRa keeps propelling forward.

I studied Digital Illustration and Animation, unfortunately i stopped schooling due to financial crisis.  I already released my own self published comics and exhibited mixed media art works in galleries. </p>
<p>There are millions of memes in the internet but there are few significant memes that are worth collecting. My book project ""Memoir of memes"" is a collection of dissident memes in the internet. Civil unrest, demonstration, revolution, graffiti, revolts are some topics of the book, i think it is important to have an archive of memes thru a book. Since ""meme"" is an idea, behaviour, style or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture, meme is the mirror of our generation, it reflects the situation of our culture, politics, art and everyday life.</p>
<p>I hope you can help me promote my book project to other people and raise the publishing expenses. The goal fund of the project is $1000 or 46,535 in Philippine Peso. The amount will be used for production costs for publishing, printing and promotion.

I studied Digital Illustration and Animation, unfortunately i stopped schooling due to financial crisis.  I already released my own self published comics and exhibited mixed media art works in galleries. 
There are millions of memes in the internet but there are few significant memes that are worth collecting. My book project ""Memoir of memes"" is a collection of dissident memes in the internet. Civil unrest, demonstration, revolution, graffiti, revolts are some topics of the book, i think it is important to have an archive of memes thru a book. Since ""meme"" is an idea, behaviour, style or usage that spreads from person to person within a culture, meme is the mirror of our generation, it reflects the situation of our culture, politics, art and everyday life.
I hope you can help me promote my book project to other people and raise the publishing expenses. The goal fund of the project is $1000 or 46,535 in Philippine Peso. The amount will be used for production costs for publishing, printing and promotion. I will also send some PDF format of the book for anyone who will donate, if had an opportunity i can also send you a physical copy of the book. If i didn't meet the goal of fund, ill try to self publish it like a fanzine.

<p>I want to pursue my passion. I want to take the time to do the studies of people, in the park and other places. I want to focus my attention on developing my craft as a portrait artist. For now, because of my busy work schedule for clients, I’ve been limited to doing digital portraits for my friend and family and sometimes for my cat. Which means that the opportunity to really grow in this area has been limited which is why I’m asking for your support. By funding my project you can help me buy the time to focus on just doing portraits and bringing people, and their pets, the joy of a personal portrait! And it’s YOU, you’re friends, family and loved ones who will be the first to benefit from my work! To get an idea of my commercial work here are some of my illustrations for my commercial clients: <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I was so disappointed and frustrated that I putted things into my own hands. First lamp that I have created led to another, after that to one more and so on... I was hooked-up. This is the job I waited whole my life, this is something I love, I dream about every single day, this is something that motivates me to go even further and beyond my limits. This is something that makes me happy from the moment I open my eyes till the end of the day when I close them.

The best gift you can give to the loved ones (or yourself).Hi Indiegogos! My name is Dominik, I am from Croatia and I am the founder of GEA Workshops - Unique Ambient Lamps.                            I came to the idea of creating wooden unique ambient lamps by being disappointed into the choice I didnt have in the local ""Lamp stores"". I was so disappointed and frustrated that I putted things into my own hands. First lamp that I have created led to another, after that to one more and so on... I was hooked-up. This is the job I waited whole my life, this is something I love, I dream about every single day, this is something that motivates me to go even further and beyond my limits. This is something that makes me happy from the moment I open my eyes till the end of the day when I close them.



 The First GEA Lamp                             My guidance is that every single lamp has to be unique on it own way, there could be similar lamps, but never the same. It is the same when you want from an artist to paint the same picture one more time, he will use the same brushes, the same colors, the same paper, the same brush-moves, but the end result will never be the same again. This is art, and i strongly believe it should stay that way.                              My ideas for lamps comes from everywhere, I see something in the newspapers, on the street, in public transportation, in my home, on the family vacation... it really doesn't matter, the idea comes when I least expect it. To be clear, I'm not trying to copy anything, for every design I create, I do my best to bring something new and original to life.                             I work with all kinds of materials, from wood, metal, paper, plastic to glass, fabric and so on. But the most positive reactions I got from the wooden square shaped lamps, and that is something I want to share with you guys here on INDIEGOGO.There are 3 sizes of square shaped GEA Unique Ambient Lamps that I want to introduce you with:
STANDARD (250×250×1200 mm / 9.8×9.8×47.2 inch)
MIDI (250×250×1000 mm / 9.8×9.8×39,3 inch)
MINI (250×250×800 mm / 9.8×9.8×31.4 inch)
Names, sizes and dimensions                             We currently have a nice variety of colors prepared for the fabric we use to cover the lamps with. From the basic colors to some complex ones. Of course we strive to expand the color palette in the future also as quality that we think it should went on a higher level. Don't get me wrong, the quality of current fabrics we use is on really high level at the moment, but we always think we can do better.Currently available colors                             There are six (6) editions of wooden square shaped GEA Unique Ambient Lamps:GEA MINI EDITION Example of GEA Mini Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×800 mm / 9.8×9.8×31.4 inch) with black wooden structure, one color fabric, E14 bulb holder, 2m black wire installation with switchGEA MIDI EDITION Example of GEA Midi Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×1000 mm / 9.8×9.8×39,3 inch) with black wooden structure, one color fabric, E14 bulb holder, 2m black wire installation with switchGEA STANDARD EDITION Example of GEA Standard Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×1200 mm / 9.8×9.8×47.2 inch) with black wooden structure, one color fabric, E14 bulb holder, 2m black wire installation with switchGEA LIMITED EDITION Example of GEA Limited Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×1200 mm / 9.8×9.8×47.2 inch) with black or white wooden structure, one to two colored fabric with limited edition decals, E14 bulb holder, 2m black or white wire installation with switchGEA DESIGNER EDITION Example of GEA Designer Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×1200 mm / 9.8×9.8×47.2 inch) with black or white wooden structure, two to three colored fabric with special decals and decor, E14 bulb holder, 2m black or white wire installation with switchGEA INDIEGOGO EDITION​Example of GEA Indiegogo Edition - Dimensions: (250×250×1200 mm / 9.8×9.8×47.2 inch) with special colored wooden structure, two to three colored fabric with special decals, decor and art, E14 bulb holder, 2 to 10m black or white wire installation with switchWarning: The images are solely for information purposes and does not represent the fully polished lamp like the one you will get.Warning(2): Lightning bulbs are not included with GEA Unique Ambient Lamps.                            Till the few days ago, I have worked and operated all alone on this project from the morning to evening.

<p>Immerse yourself into a world you might not have visited for some time – a <b>colourful</b>, <i>mindful</i>, <b>deeply personal place</b> where you can <i>relax</i>, <b>find peace for a few moments from todays often busy life</b> and <i>discover extraordinary things about yourself.</i></p>
<p>Filled with a wide variety of pictures and exercises, <b>The Big Mindful, Colourful Book </b>is yours to complete at your leisure. Whether you want to zone out or focus inwards, explore or connect with yourself, this is your opportunity to be whisked away into a world of daydreams, doodles, drawings and the corners of imagination often unvisited.</p>
<p>This book brings <b>Adult Colouring to another dimension</b> and gives you the opportunity to <b>share a deeply personal journey of self discovery and peace.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Why We Created It</b></h3>
<p></p>Towards the end of 2014, my Mom had to have an operation. According to the doctors, things went well. They were wrong. On 24th November 2014, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer - less than a week later, she was gone. <p></p>
<p>As a recovering Addict and someone who deals with a few Mental Health Challenges, finding ways to deal with the situation were difficult but ""doodling"" came to the rescue. </p>
<p>We've taken these doodles and turned them into something we believe is truly special and not just your ordinary, everyday adult colouring books.</p>
<p>This will be our way of paying tribute to a truly special lady. </p>

</div><div> <p>As a new and young business, we need to raise the funds to bring this to life. Whilst it is our dream to help as many people as possible, we know that to start off with, we need to be realistic and have decided for a first print run of either 500 or 1000 copies - obviously, the more we print, the lower our retail price can be.</p>
<p>As this is a bespoke project that needs to be put together on page at a time, start up costs for the first print run were higher than we had hoped.</p>
<p>We've taken the images we have created and turned them into 3 products that we would like to bring to life:-</p>
<p>1)<b> The Big Mindful, Colourful Book</b> - our Adult Colouring Book with a difference containing images and exercises for you to complete at your leisure.</p>

What makes this part of the project <b>the most exciting</b> is that this promises to be a <b>never-ending journey</b> once you have purchased the book.

Immerse yourself into a world you might not have visited for some time – a colourful, mindful, deeply personal place where you can relax, find peace for a few moments from todays often busy life and discover extraordinary things about yourself.
Filled with a wide variety of pictures and exercises, The Big Mindful, Colourful Book is yours to complete at your leisure. Whether you want to zone out or focus inwards, explore or connect with yourself, this is your opportunity to be whisked away into a world of daydreams, doodles, drawings and the corners of imagination often unvisited.
This book brings Adult Colouring to another dimension and gives you the opportunity to share a deeply personal journey of self discovery and peace.

Why We Created It
Towards the end of 2014, my Mom had to have an operation. According to the doctors, things went well. They were wrong. On 24th November 2014, she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer - less than a week later, she was gone. 
As a recovering Addict and someone who deals with a few Mental Health Challenges, finding ways to deal with the situation were difficult but ""doodling"" came to the rescue. 
We've taken these doodles and turned them into something we believe is truly special and not just your ordinary, everyday adult colouring books.
This will be our way of paying tribute to a truly special lady. 


What We Need & What You Get

 As a new and young business, we need to raise the funds to bring this to life. Whilst it is our dream to help as many people as possible, we know that to start off with, we need to be realistic and have decided for a first print run of either 500 or 1000 copies - obviously, the more we print, the lower our retail price can be.
As this is a bespoke project that needs to be put together on page at a time, start up costs for the first print run were higher than we had hoped.
We've taken the images we have created and turned them into 3 products that we would like to bring to life:-
1) The Big Mindful, Colourful Book - our Adult Colouring Book with a difference containing images and exercises for you to complete at your leisure.


What makes this part of the project the most exciting is that this promises to be a never-ending journey once you have purchased the book. At the back, we have details on how you will be able to get a new image every fortnight to download, print and colour at your leisure, as well as an opportunity for something else that is really exciting - an Adult Colouring Book where YOU get to be a contributor.
2) My Big Mindful, Colourful Year - 
an interactive, living, ""personal diary"" and colouring book for the
year that can be started at any time you choose.

3) The Colourful Life Cards - a deck of 64 cards to be used as a guide to uncovering your true potential.

This first round of Fund Raising will support us in bring Project 1 and 2 to life which will then, in turn, fund brining the third part of it all to life. We have already started production of The Big Mindful, Colourful Book and this should be ready for release in the next few weeks.

When you make a contribution towards this project today, you'll receive a ""taster"" booklet that we have put together containing 5 images (not included in The Big Mindful, Colourful Book) as well as 1 exercise to get you started.
The Impact
 We (my sister and ""brother"") never expected things to go the way that they
did and, in fact, I was planning to spend Christmas and New Year with my Mom and Sister in
Zimbabwe anyway – something I had not done for many years since leaving the
country in 2006. So as things progressed, and especially when they went down
hill very fast, I needed a way to deal with everything that was going on and so
began my collection of “doodles.”



The ""doodles"" were (and are) my continuing way of expressing and capturing feelings and
emotions that I can’t put into words on paper. They were (and are) a symbol
of things that my Mom loved and enjoyed in her life, but most of all, they are my
journey and something that has helped me to find peace and calm during the most
turbulent and challenging time of my life.


Over
the last 8 months, I have spent time every single day “doodling” and it has now
become time that I spend with myself. Time that I have to reflect on the day
gone by, or the day ahead. Time that I have to allow myself to heal and find
comfort during a personally painful time. 
As
someone who has always had problems switching off at night and sleeping (in the
past, my addiction to drugs and alcohol dealt with that) I now find that this
helps me to sleep better and be more productive and focused during the day. It
has helped me think clearly and positively deal with my emotions and feelings. 
In 2014, we (my Business Partner and ""brother"") opened a Health Retreat in Spain - something we have worked our whole lives towards and sharing our experience with people has always been the most important thing that we do. Showing them the ""doodles"" have also brought them peace and understanding and thanks to them, we decided to bring this to life in our own special way.
In fact, just a few days ago we received an email from our Publisher who's Mother-In-Law passed away over the weekend before - this was what she had to say about the project: -
""I’ve still a few pages to proof read but done a good batch today, in between organising the funeral and all the other ‘stuff’ like cancelling hospital appointments for Mum etc. Grief is a really debilitating thing and reading your book I took strength from your experiences and your pictures took on a depth that I had not noticed before – they really are extraordinary you know?""

If there is one important message that we like to share for people then it would be to face your fears and follow your dreams and this is our commitment to living the message that we share.

We know that what we have created is unlike any Adult Colouring Book currently on the market and this is what makes us a little bit excited about the whole project too.
Here is what our Proof Reader had to say about her experience with it all: -


""This doesn't often happen to me

incredibly moving, powerful and extraordinarily magnificent thing you have
created - I am just blown away, not just by the words, but also the exquisite

This will be held at the end of October and we need your help.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
The
ELSC promotes the self-organisation of strippers in the UK, works to change
negative societal attitudes to the industry and improve working conditions. The aim of this event is to counteract the stigma around striptease and celebrate the art of the dancers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are a group of striptease dancers based in East London who have come together due to a shared grievance we have about the poor working conditions and exploitative business practises within our industry. We also lament the stigma surrounding our job; the lack of wider public understanding about what we do, compounded by negative connotations created by poor representations in mainstream media, combined with “feminist” campaigns that seek to erase our industry and destroy their livelihoods. </span></p>
<p>In order to achieve this, we are planning an art event to celebrate the culture, art and aesthetic of our private universe. As multifaceted women, we are also visual artists and view what we do as an art from like any other, which takes time to develop, cultivate and practise. <br/></p>
<p>The event will take place over the course of ten days, combining an art exhibition, pole dance and movement workshops, a fashion show, life drawing, film screenings, an academic symposium, all culminating with a final closing party with live stage performances from the members of the collective. Hosted at the Red Gallery, Shoreditch, a mere stone’s throw from the longest running strip-pubs in Hackney.<br/></p>
<p>The objective of the entire event is to celebrate, educate, and generally revel in a unique and endangered part of London’s culture – the strip pub. The ELSC wish to generate a culture of respect around their jobs, and to start by publicly recognising the value and worth of their creative energy. <br/></p>
<p>

<p>With your help, ‘The Art of

<b>Closing party</b> - a Tarantino themed Halloween party, <span>based on the film  From Dusk 'Til Dawn, featuring performances from members of the ELSC. </span>
</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The Red Gallery supports our aims so have given us the space for free, which is wonderful. However we need money up front for things such as; insurance, chair hire, covering the costs of security, cleaning and waste at the venue, printing, framing, paying the gallery technician and sound engineer. The costs of such an ambitious undertaking quickly mount up, as anyone who has produced an exhibition or event will know!<br/>
</div>
<div>We hope certain events will pay for themselves in ticket sales - and in some cases ticket sales will subsidise free places to events - for example a proportion of seats at the academic symposium will be set aside to offer free student places. However it is the upfront costs of producing our exhibition and essential costs like insurance and technical support, that we need to cover in order to go ahead.  </div>
<div>You will get to support a ground breaking event whilst enjoying some amusingly titled perks! You can put a traditional pound in the tip jug if you want to keep it simple or be more extravagant with the VIP perks. </div>
<div><br/></div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>The Art of Stripping is shaping up to be a truly unique event, and we very much hope it inspires dancers in other places to get together and self-organise. As with many industries, workers have become more exploited and have less rights and representation. We'd love to cause a ripple effect. </div>
<div>Empowerment is an overused word however this event 'empowers' in two ways. Firstly, it makes an impact by showing the other artistic skills of dancers, and how we combine them to create artistic narratives about our experience. A perfect example of this is the recent short film, <a href=""https://www.nowness.com/story/pole-dancing-strip-clubs-and-fan-mail-dear-delicious"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dear Delicious</a>. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Secondly, the ELSC have now run successful events for a year and a half and members have developed their business skills and become event producers in the process. We are building a very wide audience that is no way limited to the traditional 'male punter' as we have a huge age range and  gender diversity. </div>
<div>As well as using art to challenge stigma and inform the debate, we are also politically engaged and have a wide understanding of feminist arguments, prohibitive legislation and good and bad business practises within the industry. Co-Founder Stacey Clare recently gave a TEDx talk covering these issues and the Art of Stripping event will add further to the wider conversation. </div>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>This is a big but exciting undertaking that challenges us all on a personal and professional level. The biggest risk we face is financial and we do not want to be left with debts at the end. Believe us when we tell you, stripping doesn't pay what it used to. Many of us are working full time to simply cover living costs, and are working every spare unpaid hour to make sure the East London Strippers Collective is a success. And while we can give freely of our time to a project we believe in, we simply do not have the capital to pay other people for their time and help. We want to be able to pay other people for their time and services, instead of relying on favours and freebies. <br/>
</div>
<div>We have experience in producing one off events, and have been incredibly successful so far. This is the first time we have organised something quite so ambitious. Curating an exhibition, with an opening event including a fashion show and cabaret, dance workshops, costume fair, academic symposium, film screening and huge closing party - all within 2 weeks, is no easy task. However we have learnt a lot and feel really confident that what we are doing is tapping into a zeitgeist, that many, many people can relate and connect to, in one way or another.<br/>

Believe us when we tell you, stripping doesn't pay what it used to. Many of us are working full time to simply cover living costs, and are working every spare unpaid hour to make sure the East London Strippers Collective is a success. And while we can give freely of our time to a project we believe in, we simply do not have the capital to pay other people for their time and help. We want to be able to pay other people for their time and services, instead of relying on favours and freebies. 

We have experience in producing one off events, and have been incredibly successful so far. This is the first time we have organised something quite so ambitious. Curating an exhibition, with an opening event including a fashion show and cabaret, dance workshops, costume fair, academic symposium, film screening and huge closing party - all within 2 weeks, is no easy task. However we have learnt a lot and feel really confident that what we are doing is tapping into a zeitgeist, that many, many people can relate and connect to, in one way or another.


    Other Ways You Can Help You can also help by sharing this campaign amongst your networks and spreading the word. If you want to put us in contact with press or anyone else you think could help, or if you are interested in the events, please contact us at ethicalstripper@gmail.com",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

<b>Flyers?</b> Have done hundreds, and there's a small gallery of them under Graphics on my site. You've seen them all over town. Have designed all but two for Fleur de Tease since September 2008. Most of the NOLA Vintage &amp; Lifestyle Expo posters. Half of the Slow Burn images, and about half of the Freaksheaux to Geaux flyers. Also have done flyers for Bella Blue, Storyville Rising, Dr. Sketchy's, Dance Quarter, NOLA Spaces, Les Rebelles, NOLitas, Sun Ray Grill, Aloha Sushi, Abby Travis, SWANS, and many other clients, with the entirety of design for the Snake Oil Festival, from stickers, to posters, shirts, to coffee mugs, even the video and original music.

<p>We teeter on moments of change, brought by forces that reach in and push out. Memories checker our thoughts; we wonder what decisions will be carved into the borders that frame our histories, and futures. What hangs in the balance, what will reach its limit, and where? And afterwards, what tokens will we be left with: a hesitant embrace, a scar, a burst of light? Our stories weave in and out of these visions.</p>
<p>With the rise of factories, investors, and development, the landscape of Bangladesh is changing. The spotlight has been turned on, and the people are trying to figure out what it means for them. This exhibition will feature nine Bangladeshi photographers whose work reflects a diverse group of people, shifting economies, and changing lands. Its aim is to not only to collect and exhibit photography as art; but also as ideas about the country of Bangladesh. </p>
<p>These photos navigate the stories of its people, landscapes, and its position in the world. Most importantly, the works provide viewers with perspectives of artists that are connected to the places they are capturing. We are proud to be collaborating with a cultural institution that is exploring the documentation of its own changing home, the borough of the Bronx, which is home to a growing generation of new Bangladeshi Americans. We hope to open important discussions around the meaning of changes, shifts, and transitions across generations and communities.</p>

The Impact 
Transitions hopes to represent and reach a community that is largely glossed over and stereotyped in mainstream media. As Bangladeshi Americans who grew up in the US, we observe a stark asymmetry in the relations of our two homelands. Bangladesh provides the US with a significant portion of its readymade garments, yet among Americans, it remains one of the least understood countries in South Asia. Despite the increasing number of Bangladeshis in all five boroughs, especially in neighborhoods of the Bronx, they are sorely underrepresented. As quoted in Art Info and the New York Times, global interest in Bangladeshi art is growing, yet we want to add more to the conversation.
This exhibition takes off from the vibrant energy of Eyes On Bangladesh (Queens, NY, March 26-30, 2014), which featured the work of nine prominent Bengali photographers, including World Press Photo winner Taslima Akhter.
                                "" I don't want to be an icon of poverty
                                          or a sponge for your guilt.
                                    My identity is for me to build,
                                               In my own Image.""
                       - Shahidul Alam, founder of Drik Picture Library


Transitions will provide Bangladeshis with greater exposure in, and access to, New York's cultural & artistic landscape, and provide a way for all generations to recognize the diversity of their roots through the lens of the photographers. This in turn will open space for new inter-/intra-generational conversation, and perhaps even inspire the creation of new art.

  Risks & Challenges We are aware of long-held stereotypes about the art world: its reputation for attracting only certain demographics, or only those well-versed in art. We wish to combat these conceptions. Transitions is not a typical, largely hands-off exhibition; it is a show designed to create dialogue in the community through primary source materials. This is why your contributions are so needed, and so appreciated.

Other Ways You Can Help  It is essential to raise the money as fast as we can, so that we can begin covering costs as soon as the pre-installation process begins. So please help by spreading the word. We will also need volunteers for the show, so just keep a look out for calls on social media! 

Join the CommunityKeep in touch! By liking us on Facebook and following on Twitter, you make us stronger! Whether you talk, tweet, or blog, you can help us by getting out the word. Each time someone who believes in our mission shares our campaign, we will be one step closer to meeting our goal.

</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p><b>The short version first:</b></p>
<p>Original printmaking in modern media, the images of statues from the past brought to life again.  I marvel that nobody else seems to have conceived of this - it's a simple, simple idea but then it's all in the execution of the work, from the sculpture chosen as model, to the photograph of it, to the printmaking skill and the gleeful, wild joy of creation that makes her live again.<br/></p>
<p><b>Who's this artist and what happened?</b></p>
<p>I've been making original art prints since the early 1970s and good at it since the early 80s (nobody needs to see my middle school or high school work!). I've shown up and down the west coast and at a few exhibitions as far apart as the University of Florida, Gainesville and the University of Hawaii, Hilo, mostly from about 1985 through 1998 and won a few prizes.  Seventeen years ago I injured both wrists in a bicycling mishap and finally - finally! - in the past couple of years technology has caught up such that I can print again.  Where I once used silkscreens to print in fine detail now I'm using a large format Epson printer and a Mac to make prints ranging from 8 x 10 inches to 27 x 39 inches.  They're originals, not reproductions, and the editions are limited to 50.  The way you limit a digital edition is delete the file once number 50 is printed, that's it, no turning back.<br/></p>
<p>Making art has been crucial to my life, and having had to stop printing for these years (I kept going until the injury's effects progressed to stage I/II osteoarthritis) didn't mean I stopped seeing.  I stored up ideas and energy to make them happen.</p>
<p>I had been blessed in the 1980s and 1990s with a series of women willing to model for the photographs from which I made silkscreen prints, combining various or many images in each piece (that older work can be seen at the website, URL below).  Last year, after moving to the South from California, I found that there are marble statues in cemeteries, mostly from the early 1800s to mid 1900s with a few earlier, some more recent.  Many are generic, no particular person (a slim body of literature on burial customs and funereal statuary, much of it in French, goes into why that was), but some are emotional, thoughtful, expressive women of their times.  Many are beautiful in a way we'd recognize early in the 21st century, while others don't match well the current ideals of beauty.  My task has become to inquire of the image who these women were, how they felt, and present them and their emotions so that we the living can recognize those feelings, those gazes across time, and find our own feelings echoing a response.  You've met some who resemble them in appearance, in feeling.<br/></p>
<p>The curator in charge at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco (it's an art museum) once told me, ""There's nothing new under the sun.""  In my mid 20s that was a challenge, in my late 50s it's permission to use the past five centuries of art and thinking about it to make these beautiful prints.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A note on the video</b></p>
<p>Originally the video had my voice narrating that there are 60 images showing something of the states this piece went through to completion, that each state had sometimes dozens of exacting changes, and that this piece was wrought over the course of two months.  That version of the video is to be seen at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMvk0aqfMRc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMvk0aqfMRc</a> .  After a couple of days it dawned on me that I'd  seen this cellist and a beautiful voice perform a song that would work better with the images.  So, that song is on the video and the explanation is here.  Thank you Sam and Robin.  Their music ( as Loop!Station) is on iTunes.</p>
<p><b>Why Italy?</b><br/></p>
<p>I reached a turning point with a piece titled ""Ice Queen"" - the subject may have been a great friend and loyal to her family, her close confidantes, and on the other hand that same camaraderie and loyalty may not have been let shine on persons outside her acquaintance.  The statue was sculpted in the mid 2000s, and on investigation I found the face is indeed the face of the deceased - at that time, last year, there were still photographs of her on the internet - but the rest of the statue was copied from one sculpted in the 1880s and is in the Staglieno monumental cemetery in Genoa, Italy.  Oh! <br/></p>
<p>I realized that it would be a very good idea to get to Genoa for a week to take hundreds of photographs.  I've found since the days of using film (I started making photographs in 1974 as an undergraduate) that one or two of every thirty images really capture what I need.  Cloudy days are best for photographing marble....<br/></p>
<p>The piece in the video took two months to complete, a few have taken less time and one or two took longer.  This journey will end up producing two dozen or so new works which will take over a year to complete.  I am of course courting  galleries in Asheville, NC, Charleston SC, and Atlanta where this work could be shown to the broader public.  It's not avant garde, though the past five centuries of composition, use of light and shadow, and continuity of emotional realities in each person's life are of no time, and all times; composition, form, gesture, sfumato, geometry, color and light all have their parts to play.<br/></p>
<p><b>Cost breakdown</b><br/></p>
<p>While my daily living expenses are pretty well taken care of, they don't include this journey nor the amount of ink and paper that will be required to make the prints.  Ink cartridges are $125 each, there are seven of them at a time, and with test printing various portions of each piece, I'll run through about $3,600 of ink; paper made to last five centuries costs $7 per sheet and if this succeeds and my funders want prints as I expect, I'll be paying $250 to $300 for paper.  Airfare runs about $900 to $1000 roundtrip, a room to stay in via airbnb costs as little as $50 a night, meals I'm hoping to do for less than $50 a day.  So travel would cost about $1700, the remainder of the objective is paper and ink and the fees Indiegogo will deduct.  If the objective is more than met, I'll have more prints to make and deliver.  <br/></p>
I propose that funders may elect to have a print of those seen at carsonbarnesart.com or the one in the video, or they may wait for the new work, or see perks; all the perks are shown on the gallery tab here, it's up to the reader to match up the perk title with the gallery piece's title (or inquire, I'd be happy to make it more clear).  I found out today that on the iPhone at least one cannot view the gallery, those viewers will have to either look at the website or get themselves to a real computer.  I'm sorry, IndieGoGo has a lot of good points but I think their app has a couple of faults yet  All prints are signed, titled, dated and numbered.  Of course, anyone who wishes to contribute but does not wish to own print(s) may do so. These ARE made to be seen and to give pleasure.<br/><br/>
<p>If I don't reach the goal, well, I'll try a test run to Pere la Chaise cemetery in Paris, and use what is contributed for materials to satisfy requests for prints.  If it goes way over, I'll also visit Staglieno in Genoa and try to get to Vienna as well.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Thank you</b><br/></p>
<p>Never having done a crowdfund before, I hope I'll be able to notify all my Facebook friends, and that they or you will notify theirs in turn.  This work is beautiful.  Thank you for your support.  <br/></p>

supporting art, culture, artists and the beauty itself. It includes several art
domains </a>as music,
theatre, plastic arts and dance. Seven artists are implied in this project: 4
musicians, an actor, a painter and a dancer. </p>
<p>The event will take place in the downtown area, next
to the main and most crowded station, in a rush-hour (The bus station next to
McDonald’s, center of Chisinau, a working day, between 5 and 7 o’clock p.m.).
The event will not last for more than 40 minutes, being a mixture of an
ordinary concert and a flash mob.</p>
<p>The artists will present at once art – pieces from the
classical period of their own art – domain:</p>
<p>- The 4 musicians will perform a piece of classical
music;</p>
<p>- The actor will recite several poems and quotes from
the classical theatre period;</p>
<p>- The painter will reproduce a classical masterpiece;</p>
<p>- The dancer will present a piece of classical dance-
ballet.</p>
<p>Other 2 persons will be sharing leaflets to people
going by. The information included there is about: </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>The
benefits people gain from art ( based on scientific reports); </p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>The
most important cultural events that will take place the following week (month);</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Some
general information about all places of cultural interest from Chisinau
(concert halls, theatres, galleries, museums, etc).</p><p></p><p>In addition, a professional photographer and a
professional camera operator will record the whole event.</p>
<p>In order to be well organized, the project also needs
a web-designer, an accountant, a sound director, and an introducer. Also there
is the initiative group, formed by 3 people (the authors of the idea and of the
concept). There are 18 people implied per total.</p>
<br/><p><b>                                                            ART! Why?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>Education and art are subjects our society is
constantly interested in. Most of the developed countries appreciate and
promote art in its various forms, from singular events to big festivals. Although the ticket prices are high, the concert halls of the modern cities are
always full. It proves a high interest in art. This countries have to serve as
an example for the Republic of Moldova, where art is still disconsidered.</p>
<p>Moldova suffers a deep motivational crisis. If we want
to change this aspect, we need to change the way people think. For this reason,
we need to support, invest and develop education and culture! This project is
innovative for Moldovan society.</p>
<p> Another problem
is the fact that many open-minded and young people do not visit very often the
cultural institutions of our city. So, the audience is limited and the
development and maintenance of the concert halls is put at risk.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this project, we will see how youngsters
become more interested in diversing their social and civic life through art.
Many children will discover a predilection for practicing and discovering
themselves in culture.</p>
<p>The importance of art will be perceived more deeply by
humans. The stereotype of considering art only a hobby will be eliminated and
art will be understood as a destiny.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>                                                              Who wins?!</b></p><p>This project has no age/gender limitations. Initiated
or not in art, everyone will benefit from this project:</p>
<p>- Civil society;</p>
<p>- People who will simply pass by; </p>
<p>- People who will get in/out of the public transport
in the bus station;</p>
<p>- Students and pupils who study in the educational
institutions next to the bus station;</p>
<p>- People who will learn about the event; </p>
<p>Per total, around 3000 people.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>                                                  What do we want to do?!</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>1.<span>

<p>The representative of the initiative
group,</p>
<p>Nicolae Leontiev.</p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>","The main goal of this project is promoting and
supporting art, culture, artists and the beauty itself. It includes several art
domains as music,
theatre, plastic arts and dance. Seven artists are implied in this project: 4
musicians, an actor, a painter and a dancer. 
The event will take place in the downtown area, next
to the main and most crowded station, in a rush-hour (The bus station next to
McDonald’s, center of Chisinau, a working day, between 5 and 7 o’clock p.m.).
The event will not last for more than 40 minutes, being a mixture of an
ordinary concert and a flash mob.
The artists will present at once art – pieces from the
classical period of their own art – domain:
- The 4 musicians will perform a piece of classical
music;
- The actor will recite several poems and quotes from
the classical theatre period;
- The painter will reproduce a classical masterpiece;
- The dancer will present a piece of classical dance-
ballet.
Other 2 persons will be sharing leaflets to people
going by. The information included there is about: 
- 
The
benefits people gain from art ( based on scientific reports); 
- 
The
most important cultural events that will take place the following week (month);
- 
Some
general information about all places of cultural interest from Chisinau
(concert halls, theatres, galleries, museums, etc).In addition, a professional photographer and a
professional camera operator will record the whole event.
In order to be well organized, the project also needs
a web-designer, an accountant, a sound director, and an introducer. Also there
is the initiative group, formed by 3 people (the authors of the idea and of the
concept). There are 18 people implied per total.
                                                            ART! Why?Education and art are subjects our society is
constantly interested in. Most of the developed countries appreciate and
promote art in its various forms, from singular events to big festivals. Although the ticket prices are high, the concert halls of the modern cities are
always full. It proves a high interest in art. This countries have to serve as
an example for the Republic of Moldova, where art is still disconsidered.
Moldova suffers a deep motivational crisis. If we want
to change this aspect, we need to change the way people think. For this reason,
we need to support, invest and develop education and culture! This project is
innovative for Moldovan society.
 Another problem
is the fact that many open-minded and young people do not visit very often the
cultural institutions of our city. So, the audience is limited and the
development and maintenance of the concert halls is put at risk.
As a consequence of this project, we will see how youngsters
become more interested in diversing their social and civic life through art.
Many children will discover a predilection for practicing and discovering
themselves in culture.
The importance of art will be perceived more deeply by
humans. The stereotype of considering art only a hobby will be eliminated and
art will be understood as a destiny.                                                              Who wins?!This project has no age/gender limitations. Initiated
or not in art, everyone will benefit from this project:
- Civil society;
- People who will simply pass by; 
- People who will get in/out of the public transport
in the bus station;
- Students and pupils who study in the educational
institutions next to the bus station;
- People who will learn about the event; 
Per total, around 3000 people.                                                  What do we want to do?!1. 
To
promote music, theatre, plastic arts and dance.
2. 
To
promote our artists.
3. 
To
create a connection between the artists.
4. 
To
let the society know about the scientific reports on the benefits of art for
the human body.
5. 
To
inform the society about the cultural events which will take place the
following week (month).
6. 
To
inform people about the cultural institutions we have in Chisinau.
7. 
To

8.

<p></p>
<p>If you have not already heard, <a href=""http://winterstations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winter Stations</a> is an annual public art competition that challenges designers worldwide to reimagine Toronto's lifeguard stations as a basis for winter art. Take a look at the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/winterstations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1000+ photos</a> tagged at last year's event!<br/></p>
<p>In its inaugural year, Winter
Stations received nearly 200 submissions from 36 countries around the world.
Four winning stations and a student-contribution from Ryerson University
debuted on Family Day turning The Beach into a wintertime destination for design
enthusiasts and families alike. The response was astounding. Media coverage
stretched around the world, including stories in Dwell, Financial Times, Design
Boom, Dezeen, Arch Daily and inclusion in Nanotecture (Phaidon Press). </p>
<p>Now in its second year, Winter
Stations has once again called on the world’s designers and they have answered
in spades. The second annual Winter Stations competition almost doubled last
year’s participation amount, with 372 submissions coming from 49 countries. With
the jury selection already taking place, the Winter Stations team is busy
planning the design concepts that will become fully-realized installations in
February 2016.</p>

<h3>Notre histoire</h3>
<p>Il y a quelque mois, nous nous rencontrions devant la station de métro Préfontaine, où Michel venait me parler d'accessibilité universelle, dans le cadre du projet <a href=""http://alaporte.orb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">À LA PORTE</a>. Au cours de notre conversation, Michel me présente alors l'idée qui lui trotte dans la tête depuis plusieurs années : réaliser une exposition associant des photos de son quotidien à des poèmes de sa composition. Sans y réfléchir à deux fois, je saute sur l'occasion de réaliser ce projet dont la simple évocation m'émeut profondément.</p>
<p>Quelques jours plus tard, je m'imisce donc dans l'intimité de Michel Pepin, que je photographie dans les différentes étapes de sa routine matinale : notre aventure commence. Je découvre alors que comme tout un chacun, il se réveille nu dans son lit, fait sa toilette, déjeune, s'habille, se prépare à sortir. Mais aucune de ces étapes ne peut être complétée sans l'aide d'un(e) préposé(e), à qui Michel doit chaque jour dévoiler sa plus profonde intimité.</p>
<p>Après plusieurs rencontres, nous nous retrouvons avec plus de 1000 photographies. Un difficile travail de sélection commence alors, et ce sont finalement 25 photos et poèmes qui sont retenus pour l'exposition finale. Ce sont ces 25 associations d'images et de mots que nous souhaitons vous présenter, et présenter au reste du monde. Un film exclusif de 10 minutes avec Michel fera également partie de l'exposition, afin de permettre à chacun de faire la connaissance de l'homme qui se met à nu sur les murs.</p>
<p>C'est pour exposer les gens à la réalité trop peu connue des personnes ayant de lourds problèmes de santé que Michel souhaite réaliser cette exposition. Comme il le dit si bien, son intimité aujourd'hui n'est qu'intérieure, car son corps ne lui appartient plus. Dans l'espoir de retrouver sa dignité perdue, Michel souhaite utiliser sa différence pour faire une différence : au moyen des images et des mots qui les accompagnent, <i>Vous l'avez sans doute remarqué... Je suis poète</i> est une véritable ode à la vie, à la force de l'humain et à l'importance de toujours se dépasser.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez d'ores et déjà découvrir quelques unes des oeuvres de l'exposition sur <a href=""http://vouslavezsansdouteremarque.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.<b>vous</b>lavez<b>sans</b>doute<b>remarque</b>.com</a> ou en allant visiter l'exposition Salonesque au MAI (3680 Jeanne-Mance) du 21 au 30 mai. <br/></p>

<h3>Quelques mots de Michel Pepin</h3>
<p>""Inlassablement, ma tête dépasse mes capacités. Ce projet tente de démontrer tous les efforts, tant psychologiques que physiques, nécessaires pour transcender un quotidien parsemé de défis. Je caresse l'ambition de réaliser ce projet depuis plusieurs années. En effet, l'idée de sensibiliser les gens par le moyen de l'art, à une réalité laissée trop souvent derrière des portes closes, est revenue périodiquement me visiter au cours des saisons. Fortement amoindri physiquement, il me fallait cependant trouver quelqu'un de confiance pour m'épauler dans cette aventure. C'est lors d'une rencontre dû au hasard que j'ai rencontré cette personne. Lorsque Mikaël Theimer m'a entendu lui esquisser les grandes lignes de ce rêve un peu fou, il a immédiatement été conquis. Deux semaines plus tard, il débarquait chez moi avec son appareil photo pour marquer le départ de <i>Vous l'avez sans doute remarquez... Je suis poète</i>. Plusieurs autres rencontres ont suivies et à chacune d'elle, comme une ombre, il m'a silencieusement suivi avec respect dans mes routines journalières, afin de dépeindre le plus fidèlement possible cette réalité contraignante liée à mes incapacités. Près de 1000 photos sont nées de ces rencontres !  Seulement 25 font maintenant parties de l'exposition. Un travail très minutieux a permis une association parfaite avec les mots. La poésie est omniprésente dans ma vie, elle m'aide à sublimer la lourdeur de la maladie. Ainsi jumelé à des images tout aussi poétique, la réunion de deux artistes aux médiums complémentaires , forme un bijou humaniste de créativité. Aidez nous à aller de l'avant avec ce merveilleux projet !""</p>

<h3>Pourquoi nous soutenir ?</h3>
<p>Contribuer au succès de cette campagne Indiegogo, c'est aider à réaliser le rêve de deux artistes en leur permettant d'organiser leur première exposition officielle. Depuis des années Michel rêve de faire de grandes choses afin de se prouver et de prouver au monde qu'il est plus fort, plus grand que la maladie qui a pris le contrôle de son corps. Quant à moi, je rêve depuis ma jeune adolescence de faire vivre des émotions à travers l'art. Michel m'a donné cette opportunité, et je lui en serai à jamais reconnaissant. Mais sans vous, nous ne pourrons nous rendre au bout du chemin. Nous avons tous les deux besoin de votre aide, et nous vous serons éternellement reconnaissants de nous offrir votre confiance.</p>
<p>Par ailleurs, les personnes qui reçoivent de l'aide à domicile comme Michel Pepin voient actuellement leur autonomie, leur confort, et leur dignité dramatiquement affectés par des coupes budgétaires. Plus les budgets se resserrent, et plus la qualité des services reçus par Michel Pepin diminue. Il n'est pas rare que les préposés qui viennent l'aider ne soient pas qualifiés pour manipuler son corps fragile. Il n'est pas rare non plus que, sous-payés, ils ne prennent pas leur travail à coeur et traitent Michel Pepin avec peu de tact, voire même de respect.</p>
<p>Peu comprennent la réalité des gens gravement malade, et dans le contexte actuel il nous apparaît important de donner aux citoyens un moyen de mieux comprendre ces situations.</p>
<p>Cette exposition est aussi un message d'espoir ; un cri haut et fort de Michel Pepin pour exprimer qu'il est fier de ce qu'il est, et que personne ne devrait avoir honte de sa propre personne, quelque soit sa condition.</p>

devrais-je plutôt dire, que tu es entrée dans mon corps. Avant cette lettre je
t'ai déjà écrit plusieurs poèmes mais force m'est de l'admettre, j'étais loin
de l'état d'esprit qui m'habite présentement. Mes mots étaient alors teintés du
nuage noir qui rôdait au fond de ma tête. Bon Dieu que tu m'en as fait baver! À
notre première rencontre, tu t'es jetée sur moi comme la misère sur le pauvre
monde, sans pitié, tu as complètement chamboulé mon univers. Pour arriver où
j'en suis aujourd'hui, ce ne fut pas de tout repos. Je t'ai tellement haïe,
tellement trouvé pesante! Quelquefois encore j'ai peine à te supporter. C'est
que, tu es assez envahissante, tu sais ? Il ne se passe pas une seule seconde de
mon quotidien où ta présence ne se fasse sentir. Partout, tout le temps, même
dans les moindres petits coins de mon intimité, tu dois te montrer le bout
du nez. Tu es incapable de me laisser seul pour reprendre mon souffle. Sois
cependant sans crainte, car je ne t'en veux pas. Non. En fait, si je t'écris ce
soir, c'est pour te remercier, te remercier pour tout ce que tu m'as appris.
Même si parfois, souvent, mes paroles t'ont adressé tous les blasphèmes du
monde, avec le recul, en aucun moment, je ne souhaiterais t'avoir jamais
rencontrée. Je le sais maintenant, les épreuves héritées de toi, m'ont
indéniablement fait avancer vers le bonheur, vers la connaissance intrinsèque
de qui je suis.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Bien sûr, j'ai perdu beaucoup de plumes avant de me rendre
compte de ce que tu avais réellement fait de moi. Les chutes ont été nombreuses
au cours des années et je ne parle pas ici que de façon métaphorique. J'ai très
souvent senti, par ta faute, les caresses du ciment, de l'asphalte, du
bois-franc, ou du tapis sur ma peau. Tu as su me mettre en déséquilibre plus
d'une fois, mais toujours, je me suis relevé, toujours. C'est d'ailleurs une
des choses dont je suis le plus fier, la résilience qui, maintenant, tout comme
toi, fait partie intégrante de mon être. Et c'est une alliée de taille à avoir
de son côté, puisque tu as plus d'un tour dans ton sac. Loin de te contenter de
ces multiples chutes, tu m'as aussi emmené dans le profond ventre du dragon des
deuils. Inlassablement, je t'ai vue arracher, peu à peu, des morceaux de mes
acquis, et ce, encore une fois, sans pitié. Ça a commencé avec mon pied droit,
ensuite tu es montée jusqu'à la jambe, puis, ce fut le même manège du côté
gauche, et tu as continué à me mordre l'intérieur de la chair. Presque toutes
les parties de mon corps y sont passées. Il faut dire qu'en 48 saisons, tu as
eu amplement le temps de te glisser sournoisement un peu partout en moi.</p>
<p>Depuis le début de cette missive, de ce déferlement
salvateur,  je ne te parle que des sévices corporels m'ayant été infligés
de ta main. Il y a bien plus cependant, beaucoup, beaucoup plus. Les pertes
dues à ma rencontre avec toi sont innommables. Je ne peux toutes te les nommer.
Je ne crois pas avoir assez d'encre ou de mots dans mon stylo, pour te les
énumérer dans une liste. D'ailleurs, ce n'est pas le but de ces lignes t'étant
adressées aujourd'hui. Aussi paradoxal que cela puisse paraître, aussi chiante
puis-je t'avoir trouvée, je dois te l'avouer. Sans savoir comment tu as pu
réussir ce gigantesque tour de force, tu as su tranquillement me mener vers un
meilleur ailleurs. Un monde qui auparavant ne m'effleurait pas même l'épiderme
de l'esprit.</p>
<p>Je ne peux plus mettre un pied devant l'autre ou me tenir
debout. Je suis devenu un marcheur immobile. Les forces de mon corps m'ont peu
à peu quitté mais, à mon grand étonnement, les forces de mon esprit ont, avec
une vigueur exponentielle, prit la relève. C'est Nietzsche je crois qui disait
""ce qui ne nous tue pas, rend plus fort"". Tu ne m'as pas tué! Tes
symptômes maladifs m'ont fait craindre le pire. Ils m'ont fait souhaiter la
mort. Ils ont fait saigner mes larmes. Ils m'ont séparé de mes enfants. Ils ont
saccagé ma dignité et mon intimité. Ils ont fabriqué ce que je suis
aujourd'hui. </p>
<p>Un homme heureux, qui observe les illusions d'un autre œil. </p>
<p>Quiconque me regarde aura comme premier réflexe, vu les
déficiences de mon physique, d'associer mon état à la présence de la maladie.
Le fauteuil roulant motorisé sur lequel je m'assoie à tous les jours, passe lui
aussi très rarement inaperçu. C'est difficile de te cacher Madame la sclérose,
car même sans rien dire, tes attributs parlent haut et fort!  Si cependant, de ce quiconque me regarde, une
personne s'attarde à me voir plus loin que les apparences, il verra. Il verra
tout le chemin parcouru main dans la main à tes côtés. En voyant cela il saura,
pareil à moi, ne plus avoir le choix. Il te prendra avec tous tes défauts. Tous.
Parce qu'une vie sans histoire est un long fleuve tranquille, dans lequel les
poissons se meurent dans la complaisance et l'ignorance. Et c'est pourquoi je
t'aime. Tu fais complètement partie de moi, de mon histoire, de mes revers, de
mes victoires. De mon appétit pour les richesses du monde : une parole, un
regard, un sourire, un geste, mes enfants, ma femme, mes amis, la lune, la
douche, mon présent, ma conscience et mon bonheur. </p>
Parce que je sais, je sais
que tout est fragile. Rien ne m'est dû. Et moi, je te dois l'urgence de vivre.</div><div>

Nous sommes deux derrière ce projet : un artiste des mots, et un artiste de l'image. Un poète, Michel Pepin, et moi-même, Mikaël Theimer, photographe. Michel Pepin est aussi connu comme le poète de la rue Fleury, sur le trottoir de laquelle il a offert ses poèmes aux passants pendant sept ans. Quant à moi, je suis l'un des deux photographes de Portraits de Montréal, le populaire blogue adapté de Humans of New York.

Si nous parvenons à collecter plus de 7 000 $ avec cette campagne, nous pourrons également éditer et imprimer un livre Vous l'avez sans doute remarqué... Je suis poète. Le livre incluera plus d'une centaine de photos, ainsi que plusieurs poèmes de Michel Pepin non présentés dans l'exposition.

rencontrée. Je le sais maintenant, les épreuves héritées de toi, m'ont
indéniablement fait avancer vers le bonheur, vers la connaissance intrinsèque
de qui je suis.



Bien sûr, j'ai perdu beaucoup de plumes avant de me rendre
compte de ce que tu avais réellement fait de moi. Les chutes ont été nombreuses
au cours des années et je ne parle pas ici que de façon métaphorique. J'ai très
souvent senti, par ta faute, les caresses du ciment, de l'asphalte, du
bois-franc, ou du tapis sur ma peau. Tu as su me mettre en déséquilibre plus
d'une fois, mais toujours, je me suis relevé, toujours. C'est d'ailleurs une
des choses dont je suis le plus fier, la résilience qui, maintenant, tout comme
toi, fait partie intégrante de mon être. Et c'est une alliée de taille à avoir
de son côté, puisque tu as plus d'un tour dans ton sac. Loin de te contenter de
ces multiples chutes, tu m'as aussi emmené dans le profond ventre du dragon des
deuils. Inlassablement, je t'ai vue arracher, peu à peu, des morceaux de mes
acquis, et ce, encore une fois, sans pitié. Ça a commencé avec mon pied droit,
ensuite tu es montée jusqu'à la jambe, puis, ce fut le même manège du côté
gauche, et tu as continué à me mordre l'intérieur de la chair. Presque toutes
les parties de mon corps y sont passées. Il faut dire qu'en 48 saisons, tu as
eu amplement le temps de te glisser sournoisement un peu partout en moi.
Depuis le début de cette missive, de ce déferlement
salvateur,  je ne te parle que des sévices corporels m'ayant été infligés
de ta main. Il y a bien plus cependant, beaucoup, beaucoup plus. Les pertes
dues à ma rencontre avec toi sont innommables. Je ne peux toutes te les nommer.
Je ne crois pas avoir assez d'encre ou de mots dans mon stylo, pour te les
énumérer dans une liste. D'ailleurs, ce n'est pas le but de ces lignes t'étant
adressées aujourd'hui. Aussi paradoxal que cela puisse paraître, aussi chiante
puis-je t'avoir trouvée, je dois te l'avouer. Sans savoir comment tu as pu
réussir ce gigantesque tour de force, tu as su tranquillement me mener vers un
meilleur ailleurs. Un monde qui auparavant ne m'effleurait pas même l'épiderme
de l'esprit.
Je ne peux plus mettre un pied devant l'autre ou me tenir
debout. Je suis devenu un marcheur immobile. Les forces de mon corps m'ont peu
à peu quitté mais, à mon grand étonnement, les forces de mon esprit ont, avec
une vigueur exponentielle, prit la relève. C'est Nietzsche je crois qui disait
""ce qui ne nous tue pas, rend plus fort"". Tu ne m'as pas tué! Tes
symptômes maladifs m'ont fait craindre le pire. Ils m'ont fait souhaiter la
mort. Ils ont fait saigner mes larmes. Ils m'ont séparé de mes enfants. Ils ont
saccagé ma dignité et mon intimité. Ils ont fabriqué ce que je suis
aujourd'hui. 
Un homme heureux, qui observe les illusions d'un autre œil. 
Quiconque me regarde aura comme premier réflexe, vu les
déficiences de mon physique, d'associer mon état à la présence de la maladie.
Le fauteuil roulant motorisé sur lequel je m'assoie à tous les jours, passe lui
aussi très rarement inaperçu. C'est difficile de te cacher Madame la sclérose,
car même sans rien dire, tes attributs parlent haut et fort!  Si cependant, de ce quiconque me regarde, une
personne s'attarde à me voir plus loin que les apparences, il verra. Il verra
tout le chemin parcouru main dans la main à tes côtés. En voyant cela il saura,
pareil à moi, ne plus avoir le choix. Il te prendra avec tous tes défauts. Tous.
Parce qu'une vie sans histoire est un long fleuve tranquille, dans lequel les
poissons se meurent dans la complaisance et l'ignorance. Et c'est pourquoi je
t'aime. Tu fais complètement partie de moi, de mon histoire, de mes revers, de
mes victoires. De mon appétit pour les richesses du monde : une parole, un
regard, un sourire, un geste, mes enfants, ma femme, mes amis, la lune, la
douche, mon présent, ma conscience et mon bonheur. 
Parce que je sais, je sais
que tout est fragile. Rien ne m'est dû. Et moi, je te dois l'urgence de vivre.

</p>
<p><b>Thank you for visiting my campaign. I am Luis Sanchez, a
painter and sculptor</b> <b>residing in Los Angeles,
CA</b>. For the past twenty years, I have made a living as a professional
artist focused primarily on mixed media painting. Following a vision of my
mother’s, I began sculpting, and realized my destiny and dreams with the
creation of my first bronze sculpture series last year.</p>
<p>Gathering momentum and
a team of collaborators, I successfully completed the first seven pieces by
December 2014. We launched to critical acclaim in Art Basel, Miami and the LA
Art Show in January, with high hopes of exhibiting the new series
internationally. However, in February of 2015 I was unexpectedly diagnosed with
an acute rejection to my second kidney transplant. My life and work were halted
as I was hospitalized for weeks, and had to undergo several painful and
aggressive treatments to return my kidney back to normal function. As of this
month I am finally considered “stable,” and have been looking forward to
getting back to work. But even as my energy, drive and inspiration are returning
to full steam, I find myself facing another obstacle – lack of capital -
following 7 months of being unable to work.</p>
<p>With a personal
investment of more than $40,000 to get this collection started, I have been
able to produce only half of this 14 piece sculpture series, (each planned as
an edition of 6). This campaign is the bridge, the infusion, the financial
injection needed to complete the series. Every single person that contributes
is a patron and part of this awesome project.  The capital from the
campaign will enable me to get back on my feet following this near deadly
experience, and also allow me to finish this series.</p>
<p>I have the sketches
complete, models photographed, two armatures and new clay ready to go. I
am a vessel waiting to deliver something new, to evoke and provoke a message of
the connection between us, technology and nature (the concept behind “The New
Alchemy” series.) Now I just need the finances to get them to the next step. So
please, come aboard ""Team Sanchez"" and contribute to this incredible
undertaking, knowing you have helped create some amazing and unique artwork and
helped forge  “The New Alchemy.” </p>
<p>We have assembled an
amazing selection of my art perks for all contributors - some exclusive to this
campaign only, including the first two images available from my brand new
T-shirt line.  Fine art prints, commissioned
work and more await the blessed contributors! ( Please visit the gallery for
images and descriptions of all perks. ) </p>

<h3><b>
About The Art </b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p> The work represents two kinds of machines; the powerful
machines that are human beings,  and the ones we create. There is a juxtaposition and
a question raised with this collection – by looking at the amazing things
created during the Industrial Revolution – and still today – that do not always
benefit society, the environment or humanity as a whole.  I see our world
today, polluted, the excessive consumption, waste, ignorance, and denial,
especially by our world leaders. The masses are not paying attention to the
signs of devastation. Oil and machines have propelled humanity to magnificent
endeavors, discoveries, advances in medicine and science, but in other ways
have a created a real threat to our very existence.   </p>
<p> Is technology ultimately helping us, or taking us further away from what’s
really important? How will it all impact our future?</p>
<p>This is the inspiration for this sculpture series, which reflects my love, respect and awareness of nature and the world around us today. My desire it that it bring beauty, hope and faith in our humanity to all who see this work. </p>

<p> Where does your money go? Why $11,000? </p>
<p>Bronze is an
incredibly expensive process, time-consuming, very challenging, and requiring
great attention to detail throughout each of the many<span>steps it requires to complete each artwork. There are
also other craftsmen involved, including the mold maker, the foundry wax experts,
welders and steel artists.All of these people
are artists in their own right – working seamlessly to create one work of art -
my vision - which typically takes 2-3 months to complete. Patinas, brushes, clay, wax, foundry costs, steel
materials, welder materials, additional artisans and laborers equals one very expensive process – and one that takes a very
long time to complete. </span></p>
<p>The fact that I
completed seven pieces last year is quite an achievement. But the medical
issues have now caused the process to come to a grinding halt. Now with only
half the series completed I need your investment in me to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Once multiple
sculptures are created and the editions completed I will be able to exhibit in
multiple galleries and cities, enabling me to regain momentum on my own two
feet. But without you - this campaign, this bridge – will not carry me to the
end of my undertaking. </p>
<p>Now is the time to
act, to believe in me. To get behind me and say, “Yes he can do this. I had a
part in that!”  Every dollar, every contribution does matter. It moves us
up in ranking, enabling me to move forward, to complete my dream, and my
mothers vision,  to reach my ultimate
destiny! </p>

<h3>The Impact YOU will have beyond this campaign</h3>
<p>Art is a great
educator in the way it can evoke dialogue, and effect change in the
world. Our world has lost touch with what is important in this life -
namely nature and humanity - through our segregated, technological,
consumer-based lives.  We are faced daily with plastic pollution that is
destroying our planet, mass deforestation in critical rain forests, and mass
wildlife extinction due to loss of habitat. We need to protect our planet for
future generations – and spread this message across the globe. For this reason
we will be donating a portion of all sculpture sales from this final collection
to the <b>Sierra Club,</b> to support the
amazing work they are doing to bring awareness and remedies to these important
issues. Our hope is that together we can help spread this message and
start a global dialogue for change.  <a href=""http://www.sierraclub.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sierraclub.org</a></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We see no risks in our
ability to achieve our goal of producing the rest of this collection. The
number of sculptures we create is directly correlated to the level of funding
we reach. Every dollar received helps us get a step a head. We have chosen
Flexible-Funding with the In-Demand option, which means that we keep all of the
funds raised, regardless of whether we reach our goal. If we do reach our goal,
the campaign will continue to live on to support the project! Every little bit
helps!!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not
everyone is in a financial position to be able to help, but don't let that stop

About The Art 


 The work represents two kinds of machines; the powerful
machines that are human beings,  and the ones we create. There is a juxtaposition and
a question raised with this collection – by looking at the amazing things
created during the Industrial Revolution – and still today – that do not always
benefit society, the environment or humanity as a whole.  I see our world
today, polluted, the excessive consumption, waste, ignorance, and denial,
especially by our world leaders. The masses are not paying attention to the
signs of devastation. Oil and machines have propelled humanity to magnificent
endeavors, discoveries, advances in medicine and science, but in other ways
have a created a real threat to our very existence.   
 Is technology ultimately helping us, or taking us further away from what’s
really important? How will it all impact our future?
This is the inspiration for this sculpture series, which reflects my love, respect and awareness of nature and the world around us today. My desire it that it bring beauty, hope and faith in our humanity to all who see this work.

We have gathered together some of the most in-demand images from Luis' painting career spanning 11 years.  The perk price includes shipping within the US, contact us for International shipping fees. 































The Impact YOU will have beyond this campaign
Art is a great
educator in the way it can evoke dialogue, and effect change in the
world. Our world has lost touch with what is important in this life -
namely nature and humanity - through our segregated, technological,
consumer-based lives.  We are faced daily with plastic pollution that is
destroying our planet, mass deforestation in critical rain forests, and mass
wildlife extinction due to loss of habitat. We need to protect our planet for
future generations – and spread this message across the globe. For this reason
we will be donating a portion of all sculpture sales from this final collection
to the Sierra Club, to support the
amazing work they are doing to bring awareness and remedies to these important
issues. Our hope is that together we can help spread this message and
start a global dialogue for change.  http://www.sierraclub.org

Risks & Challenges
We see no risks in our
ability to achieve our goal of producing the rest of this collection. The
number of sculptures we create is directly correlated to the level of funding
we reach. Every dollar received helps us get a step a head. We have chosen
Flexible-Funding with the In-Demand option, which means that we keep all of the
funds raised, regardless of whether we reach our goal. If we do reach our goal,
the campaign will continue to live on to support the project! Every little bit
helps!!


Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not
everyone is in a financial position to be able to help, but don't let that stop
you from helping us get the word out. Please share this campaign with your
friends and family, and your social networks. A simple share on social media
can go a long way to helping us achieve our goal.

<p>Casa Memoria Felicia e Peppino Impastato nasce nella primavera
del 2005 a partire dal bisogno di diffondere la verità e chiedere giustizia
contro la violenza mafiosa.Peppino Impastato, figura per molti versi unica fra
quanti hanno combattuto le mafie, fu tra i primi a intuire l’opportunità di
utilizzare il potere aggregante dell'arte, della musica e della cultura per la
formazione di una diffusa coscienza anti-mafiosa. Peppino insieme a un nutrito
gruppo di ragazzi di Cinisi, paese del palermitano che negli anni ’70 era ad
altissima densità mafiosa e dominato dal potente boss Tano Badalamenti,
fondarono un circolo culturale, il “circolo musica e cultura”, che organizzava
concerti, cineforum e mostre di fotografia. La mostra fotografica, che
denunciava l’abusivismo edilizio e l’aggressione selvaggia del territorio in
funzione di logiche affaristiche mafiose, è rimasta nella storia del movimento
antimafia: l’esposizione dei cartelli non fu autorizzata dal sindaco, e Peppino
e i suoi compagni la portarono in giro per il paese, sollevata da terra, vista
la mancata autorizzazione a occupare suolo pubblico. Per questo motivo la
famiglia, i compagni di Peppino e il centro di documentazione Impastato, da
oltre trent’anni, sostengono e incoraggiano quanti intendono sviluppare
progetti e iniziative artistiche per proseguire l'attività di divulgazione, di

of the land. When Cinisi’s mayor did not give permission to use public space to
display the exhibit, Peppino and his companions created a mobile exhibit,
carrying it themselves around town. The project is still remembered as “La Mostra

to be an important part of the anti-Mafia movement’s history. For over thiry

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>The health of both the Missouri and Hudson Rivers - their tributaries and the vast watersheds and populations they support - are threatened by oil and gas pipelines - those currently operational, and those currently in proposal or incomplete - to transport highly volatile and toxic fracked crude oil and gasses from such places as the Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota. Myriad oil and gas pipelines in various stages of operation and development, represent an expanding threat of great magnitude both nationwide and internationally to our global fresh water supply.  <strong>As our country faces critical choices about the energy infrastructures we invest in and support, it is imperative to have public, open, informed, and creative dialogue about pressing dangers, available options, and viable pathways for actions to help realize greater social-environmental justice. <i>I hold that these conversations can be deepened, enriched, and motivated in part by direct experiences in acts of ritual and participatory art.</i></strong></p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Phelps Meyer. I am an interdisciplinary artist and art educator who lives and works in Poughkeepsie, NY. I work in ceramic installation, sculpture, and experimental animation, and also with interactive projects that explore community.</p>
<h3>This project,<i> Each Day, Water</i> has been my heart's response to three interwoven crises: the water crisis of industrial pollution and waste from fossil-fuel extraction practices and pipelines; climate change due to global fossil fuel economies; and the persistent, ongoing forms of violence that indigenous people face. <i>This project aims to celebrate indigenous resistance to these forms of violence; the indigenous </i><i>sovereignty</i><i> and leadership so necessary for restoring balance in this world; and to foster constructive ally-consciousness among non-native people.</i>
</h3>
<p><strong>Community events, offered for free or with a modest suggested donation, will take place at the gallery during the exhibition. These events will include:</strong></p>
<p>*A slide lecture called ""River People"" by acclaimed historian, author, poet, musician and professor <a href=""http://www.wilkesweb.us/algonquin/evan.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Evan Pritchard</a>. Evan will present a slide show and talk about the river people (Munsee Delaware, Wappingers, Tappan, Mohican) of the mid-Hudson Valley</p>
<p>*Concert of traditional songs by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kontiwennenhawi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kontiwennahawi</a>: the Mohawk Women Singers of Akwesasne</p>
<p>*Storytelling and song with <a href=""http://earthsinger.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joan Henry</a>, Earthsinger</p>

<p>*Screenings of documentaries: <i>Black Snake Killaz</i> and <i>Awake: A Dream from Standing Rock</i>, with guests TBD</p>
<p>* A closing ceremony and 1-mile walk from the gallery to the river with Standing Rock Water Protector Chas Jewett, who has been long-practicing traditional water ceremonies with Ojibwe elder Sharon Day, leader of <a href=""http://www.nibiwalk.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nibi Walk</a>s</p>
<p>*Other possible events TBA</p>
<p><strong>Contributors to this campaign will help me realize a project that, at the time of exhibition, will have been two years in-the-making.</strong> This project will feature a gallery installation of 365 wood-fired ceramic vessels, the best among those that I have made on a regular basis since October, 2016. Each vessel in the exhibition will symbolize one day of the solar year. These cup-like forms remind people of the necessity for clean water, <i>each day</i>.</p>
<p>In the exhibition, 328 cups will contain water from Standing Rock, the Missouri/ Mni Sose and Cannonball/ Inyanwakagapi Wakpa Rivers. This quantity reflects the number of days the camps at Standing Rock were active, from April 1, 2016 to February 22, 2017.  In the gallery, the slowly evaporating water will evoke impermanence and suffuse the intimate space with the energies and smells of these rivers. The remaining 37 vessels will contain water from other significant sites of indigenous and allied struggles against perilous fossil fuel pipeline infrastructure: the ""Black Snake.""</p>
<p>Woven into the exhibition will be approximately twenty-five oral statements of powerful indigenous Water Protectors and several of their non-native allies, who wished to participate in sharing messages with the audience for this exhibit. <strong><i>If the water is the life-blood, then these spoken statements form the heart of the exhibition, and participants will be able to hear them using headphone sets provided in the gallery.</i></strong></p>
<p>There will be centrally-placed cups in the gallery into which <strong><i>participants can bring water from their own homes or from aquatic environments they cherish</i></strong>. These diverse water offerings will blend with water from the sources in this exhibition.</p>
<p>During the closing event, on Saturday, October 27, 2018, participants will be invited to choose a vessel from the exhibit to keep  and at this time, participants will also have the opportunity to make a donation to the development of the Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižin (Defenders of the Water School) for children at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which started at the Oceti Sakowin Prayer Camp. We will then make a one-mile ceremonial walk with Standing Rock Water Protector, Chas Jewett, who has been long-practicing traditional water walks and ceremonies with Ojibwe elder Sharon Day.* Chas will lead the group from Art Centro to Waryas Park on the Hudson waterfront in the City of Poughkeepsie. In this walk and closing ceremony, participants will join the water from the exhibition with that of the flowing Hudson/Muhheakantuc.</p>
<p>Water in the exhibit will carry the energy and prayers from the following sites:</p>
<p>- Standing Rock Sioux Reservation:  the Missouri/ Mni Sose and Cannonball/ Inyanwakagapi Wakpa Rivers (#nodapl)</p>
<p>- Headwaters* of the Hudson/ Muhheakantuc at Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondacks (#nopilgrimpipelines #stopspectra)</p>
<p>- Ramapo River, site of the Ramapough Lenape Split Rock Sweet Water Prayer Camp (#nopilgrimpipelines #stopspectra)</p>
<p>- Headwaters* of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca, MN (#nobayoubridge #nodapl #noline3)</p>
<p>- The Cheyenne River (#nokxl)</p>
<p>- Lake Superior (#noline3)</p>
<p>* Note: This teaching is courtesy of Sharon Day: The headwaters are clean, fresh, pure. So taking this clean water and giving it back to the river at either the mouth of the river (as we do in the <a href=""http://www.nibiwalk.org/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nibi walks</a>) or to a point of pollution along the course of a river (as we will on October 27 in Poughkeepsie) is ""“Giving her a taste of herself.” The mouth of a river (zaageeng in Ojibwe): translates as “Place where all life comes for nurturing."" Today the mouths of rivers are polluted “dead zones.” Water flows only in a sacred direction, we are the ones who pollute it, we must detoxify it. We wish to give the river a taste of herself – from the beginning to now. These walks show the water spirits that there are still people who love. When the headwater spirits come to the mouth-of-the-river spirits they confer, they let them know there are still people who love. Love is a healing grace.""</p>
<p><u><strong>Project Background:</strong></u></p>
<p>As news from the Prayer Camps of Standing Rock intensified in October, 2016, it became imperative I demonstrate solidarity with Water Protectors, who persisted in prayer, ceremony, and non-violent forms of resistance to the DAPL despite ongoing abuse by militarized police. I began to make porcelain water cups. I formed each vessel precisely on the potter’s wheel then transformed it with spontaneous visceral gestures: grief, defiance, peaceful resolve.... Some of these cups are thus poised while others embody the distortions and ruptures of violence directed both at the environment and at Water Protectors. This ritual practice became my way of Standing with Standing Rock. Their circles strained to varying degrees, each vessel embodies some of the pressures exerted on the ""sacred hoop of life;"" not only on our ecosystems, but on our social fabric. Each vessel stands in homage to the Water Protectors' resilience and ongoing dedication. In the words of one Siouxan Water Protector ""The entire event - from beginning to end - is a ceremony.""</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What I Need </h2>
<p>This project is made possible with funds from the Decentralization Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature and administered by Arts Mid-Hudson. I have also received some professional development funding from the awesome school where I teach, Oakwood Friends School. As all artists do, I've put in many, many hundreds of dollars of my own to create this work and to travel to the Dakotas. However, the expenses to fully realize this project far exceed the funding I have and have gratefully received. I need to raise about $4,000 to close my budget gap. Any less, and I will personally cover the difference. Any more funding raised than this will go to the Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižiŋ Owáyawa (Defenders of Water School) for children of Standing Rock, which started at the Oceti Sakowin Prayer Camp. While I am (truly) embarrassed to have to fundraise to do this work, especially in light of the fact that Water Protectors face so many expenses for meeting their basic needs, I can not realize this project fully on my own. I received the support of Water Protectors to fundraise, saying, ""With the blessing of Water Protectors I am going to raise funding to empower amplify their voices and share their medicine.""</p>
<p>Your help would be so deeply appreciated. Even if I realize only two-thirds of my goal, this would be an enormous help that would prevent me from going into significant debt to bring this work and event programming to the community.</p>
<h3>Funding from this drive will cover these remaining costs:</h3>
<p>$2000 - Funding toward hosting events (travel stipends, honoraria, and artist fees) with indigenous artists, activists, and scholars in Poughkeepsie during October.</p>
<p>$500 - Funding toward exhibition display shelving and furniture costs.</p>
<p>$150 - Essay commission by Standing Rock Water Protector for exhibition pamphlet.</p>
<p>$550 - Printing costs for postcards, posters, and exhibition pamphlet.</p>
<p>$400 - to assist with a fraction of travel expenses from artist's 2-week travel to visit Oceti Sakowin (Sioux) land in the Dakotas this past July to collect water and record spoken messages from Water Protectors.</p>
<p>$400 - to assist with a fraction of firing fees for wood-firings this summer in NY State, necessary for the artist to bring this body of ceramic work to completion.</p>
<h3>You Receive</h3>
<p>A donation of any amount helps hugely. You get the reward of knowing that you helped an artist realize their vision and passion. You get to know that you are helping to raise a compassionate and critical awareness of a deeply significant issue of both environmental and social justice.

<li>This art project and these community events shine light back on a yet-unresolved issue, to remind us of the ongoing, urgent concerns of the people of Standing Rock and other indigenous communities who face the threat of fossil fuel infrastructure and pipeline expansion projects into regions that impact their <i>sovereign</i> <i>territories</i> and the health and well-being of their communities. Indigenous communities already face many intense challenges, and the unjust threat of industrial pollution compounds these. Their struggle provides a focal point through which citizens of conscience must urgently examine, interrogate, and protest the wide-reaching prevalence of environmental racism.

Many tribal members face ongoing legal prosecution and disproportionately unjust consequences for their peaceful Water Protector activities at the Prayer Camps. The stand against the DAPL and Keystone XL Pipeline continues too - though with a lower profile - at the L'Eau Est La Vie Camp in Louisiana and the (currently dormant) Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's Wakpa Was'te Prayer Camp, which will re-form as necessary to resist the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline project.</li>
<li>Without awareness, and the sharpened sense of urgency brought on by the impact of direct experience, citizens remain silent on these issues.

</div><p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your interest and support.</p></div>","Project Background
The health of both the Missouri and Hudson Rivers - their tributaries and the vast watersheds and populations they support - are threatened by oil and gas pipelines - those currently operational, and those currently in proposal or incomplete - to transport highly volatile and toxic fracked crude oil and gasses from such places as the Bakken Shale Formation in North Dakota. Myriad oil and gas pipelines in various stages of operation and development, represent an expanding threat of great magnitude both nationwide and internationally to our global fresh water supply.  As our country faces critical choices about the energy infrastructures we invest in and support, it is imperative to have public, open, informed, and creative dialogue about pressing dangers, available options, and viable pathways for actions to help realize greater social-environmental justice. I hold that these conversations can be deepened, enriched, and motivated in part by direct experiences in acts of ritual and participatory art.
My name is Elizabeth Phelps Meyer. I am an interdisciplinary artist and art educator who lives and works in Poughkeepsie, NY. I work in ceramic installation, sculpture, and experimental animation, and also with interactive projects that explore community.
This project, Each Day, Water has been my heart's response to three interwoven crises: the water crisis of industrial pollution and waste from fossil-fuel extraction practices and pipelines; climate change due to global fossil fuel economies; and the persistent, ongoing forms of violence that indigenous people face. This project aims to celebrate indigenous resistance to these forms of violence; the indigenous sovereignty and leadership so necessary for restoring balance in this world; and to foster constructive ally-consciousness among non-native people.

Community events, offered for free or with a modest suggested donation, will take place at the gallery during the exhibition. These events will include:
*A slide lecture called ""River People"" by acclaimed historian, author, poet, musician and professor Evan Pritchard. Evan will present a slide show and talk about the river people (Munsee Delaware, Wappingers, Tappan, Mohican) of the mid-Hudson Valley
*Concert of traditional songs by Kontiwennahawi: the Mohawk Women Singers of Akwesasne
*Storytelling and song with Joan Henry, Earthsinger
* A Roundtable Discussion on Decolonization, with indigenous scholars, art historian, artist/s, educators, and activists: Molly McGlennan (moderator), Crystal Migwans, Joan Henry, Two Clouds, Jennifer Weston, and others TBC
*Screenings of documentaries: Black Snake Killaz and Awake: A Dream from Standing Rock, with guests TBD
* A closing ceremony and 1-mile walk from the gallery to the river with Standing Rock Water Protector Chas Jewett, who has been long-practicing traditional water ceremonies with Ojibwe elder Sharon Day, leader of Nibi Walks
*Other possible events TBA
Contributors to this campaign will help me realize a project that, at the time of exhibition, will have been two years in-the-making. This project will feature a gallery installation of 365 wood-fired ceramic vessels, the best among those that I have made on a regular basis since October, 2016. Each vessel in the exhibition will symbolize one day of the solar year. These cup-like forms remind people of the necessity for clean water, each day.
In the exhibition, 328 cups will contain water from Standing Rock, the Missouri/ Mni Sose and Cannonball/ Inyanwakagapi Wakpa Rivers. This quantity reflects the number of days the camps at Standing Rock were active, from April 1, 2016 to February 22, 2017.  In the gallery, the slowly evaporating water will evoke impermanence and suffuse the intimate space with the energies and smells of these rivers. The remaining 37 vessels will contain water from other significant sites of indigenous and allied struggles against perilous fossil fuel pipeline infrastructure: the ""Black Snake.""
Woven into the exhibition will be approximately twenty-five oral statements of powerful indigenous Water Protectors and several of their non-native allies, who wished to participate in sharing messages with the audience for this exhibit. If the water is the life-blood, then these spoken statements form the heart of the exhibition, and participants will be able to hear them using headphone sets provided in the gallery.
There will be centrally-placed cups in the gallery into which participants can bring water from their own homes or from aquatic environments they cherish. These diverse water offerings will blend with water from the sources in this exhibition.
During the closing event, on Saturday, October 27, 2018, participants will be invited to choose a vessel from the exhibit to keep  and at this time, participants will also have the opportunity to make a donation to the development of the Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižin (Defenders of the Water School) for children at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which started at the Oceti Sakowin Prayer Camp. We will then make a one-mile ceremonial walk with Standing Rock Water Protector, Chas Jewett, who has been long-practicing traditional water walks and ceremonies with Ojibwe elder Sharon Day.* Chas will lead the group from Art Centro to Waryas Park on the Hudson waterfront in the City of Poughkeepsie. In this walk and closing ceremony, participants will join the water from the exhibition with that of the flowing Hudson/Muhheakantuc.
Water in the exhibit will carry the energy and prayers from the following sites:
- Standing Rock Sioux Reservation:  the Missouri/ Mni Sose and Cannonball/ Inyanwakagapi Wakpa Rivers (#nodapl)
- Headwaters* of the Hudson/ Muhheakantuc at Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondacks (#nopilgrimpipelines #stopspectra)
- Ramapo River, site of the Ramapough Lenape Split Rock Sweet Water Prayer Camp (#nopilgrimpipelines #stopspectra)
- Headwaters* of the Mississippi from Lake Itasca, MN (#nobayoubridge #nodapl #noline3)
- The Cheyenne River (#nokxl)
- Lake Superior (#noline3)
* Note: This teaching is courtesy of Sharon Day: The headwaters are clean, fresh, pure. So taking this clean water and giving it back to the river at either the mouth of the river (as we do in the nibi walks) or to a point of pollution along the course of a river (as we will on October 27 in Poughkeepsie) is ""“Giving her a taste of herself.” The mouth of a river (zaageeng in Ojibwe): translates as “Place where all life comes for nurturing."" Today the mouths of rivers are polluted “dead zones.” Water flows only in a sacred direction, we are the ones who pollute it, we must detoxify it. We wish to give the river a taste of herself – from the beginning to now. These walks show the water spirits that there are still people who love. When the headwater spirits come to the mouth-of-the-river spirits they confer, they let them know there are still people who love. Love is a healing grace.""
Project Background:
As news from the Prayer Camps of Standing Rock intensified in October, 2016, it became imperative I demonstrate solidarity with Water Protectors, who persisted in prayer, ceremony, and non-violent forms of resistance to the DAPL despite ongoing abuse by militarized police. I began to make porcelain water cups. I formed each vessel precisely on the potter’s wheel then transformed it with spontaneous visceral gestures: grief, defiance, peaceful resolve.... Some of these cups are thus poised while others embody the distortions and ruptures of violence directed both at the environment and at Water Protectors. This ritual practice became my way of Standing with Standing Rock. Their circles strained to varying degrees, each vessel embodies some of the pressures exerted on the ""sacred hoop of life;"" not only on our ecosystems, but on our social fabric. Each vessel stands in homage to the Water Protectors' resilience and ongoing dedication. In the words of one Siouxan Water Protector ""The entire event - from beginning to end - is a ceremony.""

What I Need 
This project is made possible with funds from the Decentralization Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature and administered by Arts Mid-Hudson. I have also received some professional development funding from the awesome school where I teach, Oakwood Friends School. As all artists do, I've put in many, many hundreds of dollars of my own to create this work and to travel to the Dakotas. However, the expenses to fully realize this project far exceed the funding I have and have gratefully received. I need to raise about $4,000 to close my budget gap. Any less, and I will personally cover the difference. Any more funding raised than this will go to the Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižiŋ Owáyawa (Defenders of Water School) for children of Standing Rock, which started at the Oceti Sakowin Prayer Camp. While I am (truly) embarrassed to have to fundraise to do this work, especially in light of the fact that Water Protectors face so many expenses for meeting their basic needs, I can not realize this project fully on my own. I received the support of Water Protectors to fundraise, saying, ""With the blessing of Water Protectors I am going to raise funding to empower amplify their voices and share their medicine.""
Your help would be so deeply appreciated. Even if I realize only two-thirds of my goal, this would be an enormous help that would prevent me from going into significant debt to bring this work and event programming to the community.
Funding from this drive will cover these remaining costs:
$2000 - Funding toward hosting events (travel stipends, honoraria, and artist fees) with indigenous artists, activists, and scholars in Poughkeepsie during October.
$500 - Funding toward exhibition display shelving and furniture costs.
$150 - Essay commission by Standing Rock Water Protector for exhibition pamphlet.
$550 - Printing costs for postcards, posters, and exhibition pamphlet.
$400 - to assist with a fraction of travel expenses from artist's 2-week travel to visit Oceti Sakowin (Sioux) land in the Dakotas this past July to collect water and record spoken messages from Water Protectors.
$400 - to assist with a fraction of firing fees for wood-firings this summer in NY State, necessary for the artist to bring this body of ceramic work to completion.

The Impact
Your contribution will make a difference:

This art project and these community events shine light back on a yet-unresolved issue, to remind us of the ongoing, urgent concerns of the people of Standing Rock and other indigenous communities who face the threat of fossil fuel infrastructure and pipeline expansion projects into regions that impact their sovereign territories and the health and well-being of their communities. Indigenous communities already face many intense challenges, and the unjust threat of industrial pollution compounds these.

The last time I created an interactive ceramic installation, through the generosity of participants, I was able to gather a significant sum to contribute toward the rebuilding of a monastery and nunnery in Kathmandu, after the devastating Nepal earthquakes of April, 2015. I am seeking to raise critical awareness of an issue that has largely left the public eye since the media blackout on the #noDAPL struggle after the Standing Rock Prayer Camps closed in late February, 2017. Participants will also have the opportunity to make a contribution to the development of the Mní Wičhóni Nakíčižiŋ Owáyawa (Defenders of Water School) for children of Standing Rock, which started at the Oceti Sakowin Prayer Camp.
Despite the fact that a US District Court in Washington DC found it illegal (last June) that the US Army Corps of Engineers approved Energy Transfer Partners to complete the pipeline construction and begin its operations, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil still course, EACH DAY, through the Dakota Access Pipeline, threatening water and life. Leaks have already occurred along this pipeline route.
The sovereign Sioux Nations (Oceti Sakowin) have been directly and immediately imperiled by this and other pipeline projects (such as the current Keystone XL). The outrage and public outcry must continue as ""Standing with Standing Rock"" and all the Sioux People (Oyate) is just as urgent now as it was during the time of the Prayer Camps. Many tribal members face ongoing legal prosecution and disproportionately unjust consequences for their peaceful Water Protector activities at the Prayer Camps. The stand against the DAPL and Keystone XL Pipeline continues too - though with a lower profile - at the L'Eau Est La Vie Camp in Louisiana and the (currently dormant) Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe's Wakpa Was'te Prayer Camp, which will re-form as necessary to resist the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline project.
Without awareness, and the sharpened sense of urgency brought on by the impact of direct experience, citizens remain silent on these issues. This exhibition and these events push back against this silence and urge each person to reflect on what meaningful action they might take, each in their own way. There will be resources, references, and recommended pathways for action - both locally and nationally - made available at the exhibition and community events.

</h3><h3>  Hello my name is Kevin. I have a passion for working with wood. I have been doing this for many years now,  it has been a hobby of mine for a long time. I love to create new designs with wood and on wood. As you can see with the picture above, I like to create unique designs, each one is exclusive, hard to duplicate, one of a kind. Its like getting a painting from a famous painter, its an original one, nothing the same. It is like a Van-go or Rembrandt one of a kind.</h3><h3> I take all coloured woods cut them in to different lengths and shapes then laminate them together, in unique patterns to make the table tops, as you can see in the one picture I have, unfortunately I lost the flash drive the others were on, not to happy about that, their where a lot of tables on that flash drive, that I could have showed every one. But think you will still get the idea of what I can do with a table tops.</h3><h3>  My dream is to make this my soul business, and it's very important at this time in my life. I have a lot of new ideas in my head and I am always thinking of new ones. All I want from this business, is to make a decent living, I don't need to make a million a year, just enough to live comfortably. This is a passion of mine. Building these tables, makes me feel good about my self, makes me happy. I love creating new designs, on the table tops, for people to injoy and show off to there friends, to look at, and have them say wow, that is remarkable. That's why I want this to happen for me, that's why its important, to me. It makes me feel good.   You as contributors can make my dream come true and goal come true for me. You as contributors will help me buy the equipment needed, such as a big drum sander, cnc router, table saws, chop saws, band saws, office equipment, and much, much, more equipment needed and possibly, if enough raised, to buy or build a building big enough to hold the equipment, needed to build these tables. You as contributors can realy make this dream happen for me. Here are pictures of some equipment needed plus there will be much, much, more needed. </h3><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415496/oqe1moijeahcjewcyfve.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415543/g1idbkawdfcxj5hufnpx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415674/vz5vms0abht1zqwbwcp0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415746/puouquykrtoodxxkvufk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415788/nznxxg8vcvqaeatqumh9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455415838/uekarmmcoge9cijiokdw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455470339/uugsgamp39mvf1kecft3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>    Please read and look further in to my campaign you will see some different ideas, that I'd like to convey on the table tops, for people to enjoy, for many years. The table tops I do are more exclusive, unique, rare and one of a kind, like the table you see next.</h3><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455416568/vi96jcibs297dqjisrsx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455416607/hlrp2r0fqhwik6p7kjbg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455416662/kdjc01ywdmjrvlywk9sb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455416700/bbgdutg0p7dewd8ilnpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h3> Thank you from the bottom of my heart for contributing to my campaign.</h3><h3>   This is a new start up business.

  Hello my name is Kevin. I have a passion for working with wood. I have been doing this for many years now,  it has been a hobby of mine for a long time. I love to create new designs with wood and on wood. As you can see with the picture above, I like to create unique designs, each one is exclusive, hard to duplicate, one of a kind. Its like getting a painting from a famous painter, its an original one, nothing the same. It is like a Van-go or Rembrandt one of a kind. I take all coloured woods cut them in to different lengths and shapes then laminate them together, in unique patterns to make the table tops, as you can see in the one picture I have, unfortunately I lost the flash drive the others were on, not to happy about that, their where a lot of tables on that flash drive, that I could have showed every one. But think you will still get the idea of what I can do with a table tops.  My dream is to make this my soul business, and it's very important at this time in my life. I have a lot of new ideas in my head and I am always thinking of new ones. All I want from this business, is to make a decent living, I don't need to make a million a year, just enough to live comfortably. This is a passion of mine. Building these tables, makes me feel good about my self, makes me happy. I love creating new designs, on the table tops, for people to injoy and show off to there friends, to look at, and have them say wow, that is remarkable. That's why I want this to happen for me, that's why its important, to me. It makes me feel good.   You as contributors can make my dream come true and goal come true for me. You as contributors will help me buy the equipment needed, such as a big drum sander, cnc router, table saws, chop saws, band saws, office equipment, and much, much, more equipment needed and possibly, if enough raised, to buy or build a building big enough to hold the equipment, needed to build these tables. You as contributors can realy make this dream happen for me. Here are pictures of some equipment needed plus there will be much, much, more needed.     Please read and look further in to my campaign you will see some different ideas, that I'd like to convey on the table tops, for people to enjoy, for many years. The table tops I do are more exclusive, unique, rare and one of a kind, like the table you see next. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for contributing to my campaign.   This is a new start up business. It is manufacturing unique tables  of  designs made up of different coloured hard and soft woods. The tables could also be inlaid  with different pictures on top of your choice, such as wild life, and family , etc. as you will see at the end of the campaign.   I also do conventional tables as well. They come in sizes from 3 feet wide, to 8 feet long, I am looking to advertise via web site and news paper, across Canada and the USA. etc.. to reach out to a broader scope of costumers, once up and running.      I am looking to raise $225,000.00 dollars, to start this company up for all the equipment needed and advertising needed for the first year.                      The ultimate goal would be to raise enough money to get a building that would be big enough for this business, all though the equipment comes first, that is the most inportent right now.       Please send all emails to this email address regarding any questions or for a pre order of a table of your choice.  kekasauniquetables@gmail.com
     To pre order a table in advance please feel free to email that to my email address above.Prices will vary. For instance, say you want one 8 foot long abstract table, which is like the first table you just seen up above; it is normally $3400.00. If you pre order now you can get an abstract table that size for $2700.00, that is a $700.00 dollar savings. Now if you got a 6 foot abstract table it would be $2400.00 regular $2900.00, and if you got a 4 foot abstract one, thats an apartment size table it would be $2100.00, regular $2500.00, and a abstract coffee table for $1500.00 regular $2100.00. And conventional tables start at $1800.00 and work there way down as well.  I will even throw in some unique  coasters and a cutting board with any pre order. I will save the emails and you will be contacted when up and running for more info. Thank you for funding kekasa unique tables manufacturing.    May many new things happen in the very near future with this business venture. Thank you and god bless you all for helping me with my dream.   Here are some sample pictures of some tables, that  I do. I am more exclusive to the table that you see at the top, and the one on the front cover. I would have had more pictures like the abstract  ones  I have done, like the top table, but I seem to have lost my flash drive I had them on, not to happy about that.   There are many ideas that I come up with and these are just some of them, please scoll down look through them all. 







here are some other things ill be doing on the table tops. these are just some ideas im throwing out there , just used what i had to work with on a very low budget.
you will see some curl on the pictures that i didnt notice, but the real ones will be inlaid on real wood, and only stains or paints used if requested, the pictures once up and running can be the same size as the tables, to look like a big picture or mural, 
can also put quotes on the table a little bigger of course


can also do wild life pictures  and they can also be bigger and up to the same size as the table






can also do up your family or wedding pics as well these pictures you see have some curl, the way i do them on a table top they are inlaid on top not like these, these are just exsamples what else you could do on a table top.






now this one I wasnt sure if i should put in , but was thinking that if any of these sold i would donnate $500 dollars to the fondation looking after the victoms families.


now here are some more ideas, i thought they looked realy cool





now just remember i have many ideas for the tables.
Thank you for looking over my campaign and contributeing to it , may this indever take off with flying colours and be a successful one, thank you and god bless you all for helping me with my dream come true.",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me...</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Liz and I'm an <a href=""http://lizcalvi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">artist</a> based between NYC and London. I received my BFA in Photography in 2012 from the Hartford Art School. Since then I've exhibited internationally, received various press and given artist talks about my work because it's important that my art creates a dialogue. </p>
<p>This year I decided that it was time to push myself to the next level, so I applied and was accepted into the prestigious <a href=""https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/mfa-fine-art/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goldsmiths College</a> in London to pursue their Masters in Fine Art program. I couldn't be more excited about this achievement but need financial support to fully realize my goal. Your support not only will help me to pursue my Masters degree but will enable me to strengthen and expand my voice while spreading my message to a wider audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have been saving up funds for my Masters degree for the past two years and was able to secure a student loan for $20,000 to cover my first year of studies. (The MFA program is 2 years) However I need an additional $40,000 to fund my second year. Here's a breakdown of my costs:</p>
<p><strong>Year 2 Expenses</strong></p>
<p>$28,630 <a href=""https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/study-section/fees/PG-Fees-1819.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tuition</a> (MFA 2YR)</p>
<p>$10,000 Living</p>
<p>$3,000 Projected Art Supplies</p>
<p>I'm asking for <strong>$27,650</strong> to cover half my total tuition and help with art supplies for next year, however I still have expenses for living, supplies and tuition I'm funding myself.</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised over my goal will be used towards my student loans, art supplies and a donation to a local LGBTQ advocacy organization.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards for you!</strong></p>
<p>I've designed reward levels ranging from limited edition prints to commissioned portraits and a  personal studio visit.</p>
<p>The print pieces are a great way to invest in my art early on and the commissioned work can be a portrait of you or a gift to a loved one! </p>

</p>
<p>When you purchase a brick, you'll be helping us improve Ginger Rogers' birthplace - and turn it into a museum so that everyone
can visit the site. Don't worry if our initial campaign does not meet its goal - the project WILL go on, and will continue after that. We have additional assistance coming in from other sources. </p>
<p><b>The house is was listed as an Historic Landmark in 2003 by the City of Independence,
Missouri.</b></p>
<p>The house was built in 1906, and Virginia Katherine McMath (later
to become Ginger Rogers) was born here in July 16, 1911. She lived in
Independence in this house for about two years with her mother, Lela, who was a writer for a local newspaper, then a film screenwriter in Hollywood. Ginger lived with her grandparents in Kansas City until age 9 when her mother, Lela, took her to Fort
Worth, Texas where Ginger was ""discovered."" </p>
<p>Rogers was well known for her dance films with Fred Astaire, and
was a talented singer, dancer, and actress. Her films are still loved by generations of fans.
Rogers revisited this home in 1994 for her birthday celebration put on by the city of Independence and Mayor Ron Stewart for ""Ginger Rogers Day"". She died on April 25, 1995 at the age of 83.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We
think that tourists and residents of Independence, Missouri, will enjoy seeing this
site while visiting other local historic landmarks such as the Truman Presidential Library,
Truman Home, Vaile Mansion, 1859 Jail, and the historic Independence Square. This site is
located not far from all of these important places. Tour buses often drive by the home now-- imagine the response when people can get out and go through the house!</p>
<p>Since
this is an historic property with Landmark status, any major or cosmetic change must be approved by the Heritage Commission. This includes zoning changes through the city, getting approval for cosmetic and structural changes, hiring an architect for an addition to be built, paying for plans, and getting approval
from the neighbors for the planned improvements. All of this costs money and we'll need to hire an attorney, architect, designer, and subcontractors. This is the first
step in making this all happen so the public can enjoy visiting this historic
home and museum. </p>
<p>If we get approval to move forward with the project we may return to request more funds to do exterior
landscaping, parking, and site improvements. If we don't get approval for plan A, we
will request rezoning to turn the site into a vacation rental or open house museum so people can
still visit, and for a marker to be placed on the corner of the lot. All of the money received will be put to good use. We are keeping this project open for continued donations since we'll need operating capital on an ongoing basis. </p>
<p><b>UPDATE 2/26/2016:</b> Our initial visit with the City planning department and Heritage Commission went very well and so far there are no objections!</p>

2015. Now in it’s second year THAT ART FAIR has geared up to present a very
exciting 19 day line up of work by artists from across the African
continent and the diaspora. 
THAT ART FAIR is an initiative of ART AFRICA magazine. Founded in
re-action to the fact that many countries in Africa lack the formal structures
of commercial art galleries where artists can exhibit their work and/ or be
represented by galleries or dealers, THAT ART FAIR offers them such
a platform. Emerging and established can showcase their work in a relaxed but
professional environment, here they can be meet directly with collectors,
galleries and new audiences alike! The burgeoning contemporary African market
is ripe for the picking and growing a young and invested collector base is our
aim.
Our call
for participation elicited over 165 applications from artsists and galleries
from 20 African countries, including Ghana; Mali; Senegal; Brazil; Ethiopia; Egypt;
Cote d'Ivoire; Kenya; South Africa; Namibia; Angola; Mauritius and then as far
afield as China; Canada; Dubai and Brazil!
THAT
ART FAIR presents :
· 
Visual art and photography; 
· 
a Comic art focus curated by Su
Opperman and presented by ComicArtAfrica;

· 
THAT FILM FOCUS a curated film screening
week; an African film collaboration with Shnit
· 
Performance art
· 
Video art
· 
Fashion and Culture curated by
SKATTIE
· 
Urban art and live painting
· 
ARTSUPERMART
· 
Workshops and talks- a series
of interesting and topical discussions
· 
THAT ART PARTY! Set to take place on 19th
February 2016 from 20h00 this is the “do not miss out” event of the year. Last
year’s (much talked about) party saw a line up that featured
luminaries of the art and music world. Keep a watchful eye on our website your
for the release of our edgy and eclectic line-up for THAT ART PARTY 2016!
THAT ART PARTY, the official fair celebration is set to take place on the 19th February. Last year’s much talked about party (you can watch a video here)

saw a line up of such luminaries of the art and music world as The Brother Moves On, Spoek Mathambo, Thor Rixon, Champions of the Sonarverse, Skattie DJ Athi Patra Ruga & the Shield and Spear documentary screening.

<h4>The Fox Darkroom is a passionate community of film photography &amp; darkroom enthusiasts based in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. </h4>
<h4>Our dream is to expand our space into a gallery, artist studios &amp; creative precinct. With your help, we can create the perfect space to celebrate great photography and inspire others to make art by hand. </h4>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story...</span></p> <p>I'll never forget the first time I saw an image appear in the darkroom. The first blacks creeping into whites of the paper, the anticipation to see if it worked, the glow of the red lights, &amp; above all the pride of producing something by hand. I was instantly addicted. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It was that feeling all those years ago that made me fall in love with photography.   </span></p>

<p>The name pays homage to one of the pioneers to of the photographic process - Henry Fox Talbot. </p>
<p>Although it's still early days, The Fox Darkroom has grown heaps in the last year and a half.  We run regular workshops teaching the art of film photography and darkroom printing.  We also ran our first international photography workshop in Cambodia and have more planned for the future.  There is no room for egos within these walls, everybody has the right to learn. A<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">t the heart of The Fox Darkroom are our members.

<p>The quality of the work being produced at Fox is on the rise too. We can develop and print all formats of film from 35mm, 120, 4x5"" right up to 8x10"". Together with my members we hosted our first group exhibition in 2015 and a few of us (myself included) are working toward solo exhibitions. </p>

</div><p></p></div>","The Fox Darkroom is a passionate community of film photography & darkroom enthusiasts based in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. 
Our dream is to expand our space into a gallery, artist studios & creative precinct. With your help, we can create the perfect space to celebrate great photography and inspire others to make art by hand. 

Our Story... I'll never forget the first time I saw an image appear in the darkroom. The first blacks creeping into whites of the paper, the anticipation to see if it worked, the glow of the red lights, & above all the pride of producing something by hand. I was instantly addicted. It was that feeling all those years ago that made me fall in love with photography.   
Since then, the digital age has changed the way we produce photography in ways we couldn't have possibly imagined. There is no doubt some things have changed for the better, however, I couldn't help feeling some of the magic had disappeared.
In 2013, I felt the need to pick up my old film camera and start developing & printing in the darkroom again.  The first step was finding a suitable space to construct a small darkroom. At what can only be described as fate, I chanced upon the most amazing location in a beautiful old wool store in the heart of the industrial suburb of Kensington.  
Overnight my idea for building a personal darkroom grew into the dream of building a community darkroom where others could learn and share in my passion. 
I invested everything into constructing my dream. I was adamant that I not only wanted a darkroom with excellent facilities but also a space where people felt comfortable and inspired to create and share with others. 


This is how the space looked back in 2013..

We turned it into this!


The Fox Darkroom

In May 2014, I launched what may be Melbourne's most unique business, The Fox Darkroom. 
The name pays homage to one of the pioneers to of the photographic process - Henry Fox Talbot. 
Although it's still early days, The Fox Darkroom has grown heaps in the last year and a half.  We run regular workshops teaching the art of film photography and darkroom printing.  We also ran our first international photography workshop in Cambodia and have more planned for the future.  There is no room for egos within these walls, everybody has the right to learn. At the heart of The Fox Darkroom are our members. Currently, we have a small army of 63 darkroom enthusiasts from all walks of life.  I would never have predicted there were so many people out there who shared my love for film in Melbourne and around the world. Best of all, I get to watch the joy of others when they experience their first print appearing in the darkroom.
The quality of the work being produced at Fox is on the rise too. We can develop and print all formats of film from 35mm, 120, 4x5"" right up to 8x10"". Together with my members we hosted our first group exhibition in 2015 and a few of us (myself included) are working toward solo exhibitions. 

The Fox Darkroom & Gallery!
With your help, we're ready to take Fox to the next level. A beautiful space has become available adjoining The Fox Darkroom via the cobblestone laneway outside our door.  With 177 square meters of potential, we plan on transforming this space into the photographic home of Melbourne. 

The front of the space will be transformed into a cosy gallery full of industrial charm.  We envision this gallery having a strong focus on photographic art and traditional process.  With a little love, this space will be so warm and inviting. A great place to have a coffee, look at some quality art, & engage in conversation.   
The gallery would be available for group and solo exhibitions. We don't just see this space as a way to show great art but, more importantly, to bring our community together through photography.
The rear half of the space would be transformed into 6 artists studios and a communal workshop space/photographic studio.  We want to generate a hive of creative activity here. The in-house artists would help finance the day to day costs to maintaining the gallery. The workshop space/studio space will also be used as a way for us to give something back to the community.

<p><b>9E<sup>2</sup> in Seattle, October 2016</b><br/></p><p>In 1966, Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Klüver, a Bell Labs
engineer, created an event in New York City, “9 Evenings: Theatre &amp;
Engineering.” They paired ten engineers with ten artists and performers. The
artists and performers included Rauschenberg and John Cage and choreographers
Lucinda Childs and Deborah Hay, among others, and produced pioneering work that
brought together art, science, and technology in compelling new ways. </p>
<p>In October 2016, we will commemorate the half-century
anniversary of 9 Evenings with 9E<sup>2</sup>, a festival of art and technology
to be held in Seattle. We’ll bring together artists, scientists, and engineers
to both honor the traditions of 9 Evenings and investigate the artistic
potentials of 21st century science and technology.</p>
<p>In 2016 we will draw together artists and scientists from
across the globe, pairing them with artists, scientists and engineers from

pay the artists and scientists, to produce the October event, to cover the many
costs associated with a project of this scope.</p>
<p>We’re doing this initial campaign to raise the seed funding

events. </p>

<p></p></div>","9E2 in Seattle, October 2016In 1966, Robert Rauschenberg and Billy Klüver, a Bell Labs
engineer, created an event in New York City, “9 Evenings: Theatre &
Engineering.” They paired ten engineers with ten artists and performers. The
artists and performers included Rauschenberg and John Cage and choreographers
Lucinda Childs and Deborah Hay, among others, and produced pioneering work that
brought together art, science, and technology in compelling new ways. 
In October 2016, we will commemorate the half-century
anniversary of 9 Evenings with 9E2, a festival of art and technology
to be held in Seattle. We’ll bring together artists, scientists, and engineers
to both honor the traditions of 9 Evenings and investigate the artistic
potentials of 21st century science and technology.
In 2016 we will draw together artists and scientists from
across the globe, pairing them with artists, scientists and engineers from
Seattle's vibrant art community and technology companies and schools. And we
will create a deeply powerful celebration across Seattle.
Over the next year, we will be raising the funds needed to

<h3>Thanks for viewing my IndieGoGo campaign! I’m Classy Bish Kate, creator of Sassfirmations!</h3>
<p>Sassfirmations came to me one rough day when I was saying affirmations for my sanity but all I could think was “I really wish these had a cuss word or more of my sass.” I crafted a list for myself and started to feel my mood boosting. I started to post from my list and realized that many of my friends enjoyed my sayings and saved them for later. I started creating weekly free Sassfirmations for my community newsletter- The Classy Bish Collective.</p>
<p>I started to see my friends happier and spreading the sass and encouraging their friends to have better mindsets and to believe in themselves! It is such a cool self love movement to watch!</p>
<p>A year after creating Sassfirmations, I ordered in my first set of 100 decks and they quickly sold out. I was asked for more and to order in expansion packs but didn’t have anyone interested in crowdfunding. I tried to crowdfund myself and it fell flat without a platform that didn’t help me promote and share. Here we are!</p>
<p>Not only am I trying to order more of the OG Sassfirmations you see, but also decks focused on Parenting, Body Love, and Financial Abundance!<br/> </p>
<h3>Want to know more?</h3>
<p>To order in the next level of Sassfirmations, I need to raise $2000! This will cover all four decks, packaging, and gifts for early orders!</p>
<p>People who order by Sept 25th will receive a free Sassfirmation gift and free shipping when all four decks are ordered!</p>
<p>Receive bulk pricing discounts on orders over 5 of each deck! These cards are great to slip into customer orders or as gifts to your bish friends this holiday season!</p>
<p>if you order over 20 decks, I will mention you on my website with a big thank you! If you have a business, I will also link you!</p>
<p>If the goal isn’t reached, I will continue raising the funds but ordering decks in may take longer. Share this campaign with friends to help us get the decks in sooner!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is my hearts work: empowering individuals to be their best and happiest selves.</p>
<p>I love the self love and confidence that has spread from thinking “this sentence could really use an f bomb”.</p>
<p>I am so happy the first 100 decks sold so quick and I can’t wait to get more Sassfirmations out in the world!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While people have been asking for more, people have been wary too put money down as they want the product NOW. What they have failed to realize if they all put in, we could get the decks in FAST.</p>
<p>You can help with that by contributing and sharing the word!</p>
<p>I know with  my marketing degree combined with my sass, personal network, and your network this will be a walk in the park!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I get being in a financial place you can’t contribute but sharing this campaign means THE WORLD TO ME! Share this link, my YouTube video, IGTV, and more to bring attention is SO HELPFUL,</p>
<p>I believe in Sassfirmations so much I even have free ones available! That’s how much I believe these can help change our self love routine and negative thoughts to positive ones. </p>

<h3>Peace &amp; Love</h3>
<p>La mia vita negli ultimi anni è cambiata, ora è basata solamente sul desiderio di conoscere, di farmi emozionare dal mondo e dall'umanità, anche per questo motivo ho iniziato il mio progetto One Hundred Portraits, prima ancora che per scattare fotografie per vivere l'amore e la pace che scaturiscono da un rapporto breve ma intenso come una sessione di fotografie di ritratto. Fotografia consapevole. <strong>Mindful Portrait Photograpahy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sono un artista ed un fotografo che ama il mondo, la vita, le persone.</li>
<li>Voglio realizzare un libro d'arte ed una mostra con 100 persone che vivono o passano dall'Italia</li>
<li>Il tuo contributo è importantissimo, perché aiuterai a far emergere storie di umanità e di bellezza.</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>Di cosa ho bisogno e cosa otterrete</h3>
<p>Stampare un libro d'arte e realizzare una mostra in una location straordinaria ha un costo, l'ho calcolato in 10.000 euro</p>
<ul>
<li>100 stampe 70x100 attaccate su un supporto rigido 4500 euro circa</li>
<li>200 Copie del libro stampate in due volumi firmati e numerati 3500 euro</li>
<li>Realizzazione dei portfolio 2000 euro</li>
</ul>
<p>Voi potrete ottenere edizioni limitate dei libri, delle stampe e dei portfolio, tutti firmati.</p>
<p>Qui potrete trovare un impaginato con alcuni degli scatti selezionati. NON HA la veste grafica del libro, serve solo a tenervi aggionati sulle foto del progetto. <a href=""https://indd.adobe.com/view/13cf685d-0fa2-4eef-8b53-ca17057a4eba"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clicca qui!</a></p>

<h3>L'impatto</h3>
<p>Voi potrete fare la differenza dando un senso all'arte della relazione che si crea durante una sessione di ritratto.</p>
<ul>
<li>Il progetto è importante perché racconta le persone che popolano o passano dall'Italia</li>
<li>Ho già realizzato progetti in giro per l'europa, il più importante è ""Rebirth"" (Italia, Spagna, Francia), totalmente auto-prodotto, è prevista una mostra a Parigi nel 2018</li>
<li>Sui ritratti sto a metà dell'opera (poco meno di 50 già selezionati, ritrarrò circa 200 persone per poter distillare il meglio), devo continuare ad esplorare, sto lavorando per fotografare dei migranti ""di passaggio"" per l'Italia.</li>

La mia vita negli ultimi anni è cambiata, ora è basata solamente sul desiderio di conoscere, di farmi emozionare dal mondo e dall'umanità, anche per questo motivo ho iniziato il mio progetto One Hundred Portraits, prima ancora che per scattare fotografie per vivere l'amore e la pace che scaturiscono da un rapporto breve ma intenso come una sessione di fotografie di ritratto. Fotografia consapevole. Mindful Portrait Photograpahy

Sono un artista ed un fotografo che ama il mondo, la vita, le persone.
Voglio realizzare un libro d'arte ed una mostra con 100 persone che vivono o passano dall'Italia
Il tuo contributo è importantissimo, perché aiuterai a far emergere storie di umanità e di bellezza.



Di cosa ho bisogno e cosa otterrete
Stampare un libro d'arte e realizzare una mostra in una location straordinaria ha un costo, l'ho calcolato in 10.000 euro

100 stampe 70x100 attaccate su un supporto rigido 4500 euro circa
200 Copie del libro stampate in due volumi firmati e numerati 3500 euro
Realizzazione dei portfolio 2000 euro

Voi potrete ottenere edizioni limitate dei libri, delle stampe e dei portfolio, tutti firmati.
Qui potrete trovare un impaginato con alcuni degli scatti selezionati. NON HA la veste grafica del libro, serve solo a tenervi aggionati sulle foto del progetto. Clicca qui!


L'impatto
Voi potrete fare la differenza dando un senso all'arte della relazione che si crea durante una sessione di ritratto.

Il progetto è importante perché racconta le persone che popolano o passano dall'Italia
Ho già realizzato progetti in giro per l'europa, il più importante è ""Rebirth"" (Italia, Spagna, Francia), totalmente auto-prodotto, è prevista una mostra a Parigi nel 2018
Sui ritratti sto a metà dell'opera (poco meno di 50 già selezionati, ritrarrò circa 200 persone per poter distillare il meglio), devo continuare ad esplorare, sto lavorando per fotografare dei migranti ""di passaggio"" per l'Italia.



Rischi e sfide
Al raggiungimento di 2500 euro darò via alla produzione del libro, con ulteriori 1000 euro creerò i portfolio. Solamente al raggiungimento del mio goal di 7500 darò via al progetto mostra.

With the help of photographer, videographer, and graphic designer Sasha Campbell, we have created a modern tarot deck as a tool to help you navigate the journey of life.  The deck has been completed, printed, and is ready for distribution. This deck can be a resource for daily meditation; a game to play for fun and thoughtful interactions with friends and new acquaintances; or a tool for spiritual counselors, psychologists, life coaches, and social workers.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $15000 to cover the purchase of 500 decks, boxes, and books for sale and distribution of the initial print run and funding to support a second print run.</p>
<ul> <li>The
Tarot of the Human Experience uses modern black and white photography to
capture archetypal situations that are common to our human experience.
 This deck is a modern conceptualization centered on the core elements
of classic tarot design: 22 major themes of human life (e.g., The Fool’s
Journey), 4 suits related to the 4 elements, and 16 aspects of personality found
in the court cards of the minor arcana).  The deck is visually accessible
and ready to pick up and use for those new to tarot.  It is also designed
with a scholarly underpinning that can engage professional counselors and
people interested in complex systems of thought. See sample images of the cards at: <a href=""http://www.blackunykorn.com/tarot-of-the-human-experience-cards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.blackunykorn.com/tarot-of-the-human-...</a><br/>
</li>
<li>As a thank you for your support, a variety of
perks ranging from a copy of the Tarot of the Human Experience to tarot
tutoring to a year of tarot readings are available. Check out all the perks!</li>
<li>The
Tarot of the Human Experience has 98 cards, instead of the traditional 78.
 The 20 extra cards are reversed meanings for cards numbered 6 to 10 of the minor
arcana suits. For example, the 9 of Water is named Accepting and the 9 of Water
reversed is named Rejecting).</li>
<li>The
Tarot of the Human Experience is printed on card stock that is equivalent to
playing cards. Each card measures 2 3/4 inches by 4 1/4 inches, which makes the
deck very easy to shuffle and hold.</li>
<li>This deck breaks with a number of traditions that are common to most modern tarot decks.  It is not a Rider-Waite, Golden Dawn, or Thoth tarot ""knock off""; most decks published today mimic these older decks, mostly with changes in art and some modern modifications to the originating themes.  This deck is revolutionary. Old themes and rigid adherence to tarot tradition keep tarot cards out of mainstream use.  This deck has the potential to push tarot into the mainstream by using modern black and white photography and through the purposeful rejection of limiting and charged references (e.g., pentacles, swords, queens, kings, Hierophant, Tower) for more common and accessible ones (e.g., practical life, creativity; life professions: the Engineer, the Farmer; and deep common themes we all experience: Sharing Knowledge with Others, Sudden/Unexpected/Dramatic Change).  Except for the 78 card structure (4 suits, 22 trumps) the deck is a new vision for the tarot.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Tarot has an interesting history as a card game that has evolved into a spiritual and psychological tool.  With this deck I asked and answered the following question: ""What would a tarot deck look like if, first and foremost, it was designed to be a spiritual and psychological tool, not a card game?""  I have used the tarot and oracle cards to help myself and others navigate difficult and challenging life situations since 1989 (when I purchased my first deck; I did my first professional reading in 1992).  I have seen firsthand the powerful positive impact this tool can have in my life and other people's lives.  Properly done tarot readings change people's lives for the better; I make a substantial portion of my living seeing proof of this outcome on a weekly basis.  Even if the deck is used solely for personal purposes, you will be astounded at how helpful it can be to own and use it regularly or when you encounter a difficult circumstance in your life or need to break out of a stagnant pattern.</p>
