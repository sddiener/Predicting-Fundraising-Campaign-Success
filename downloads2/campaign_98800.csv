<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to Jah-Min Tours!   Our mission is simple:   Empower the tourist\traveler to Jamaica, by providing a personal touring and travel experience, while helping its elementary schools.  </p>
<p>As a commitment to its travelers, Jah-Min Tours will not have any allegiance to any specific tour operator or company.   This doesn't benefit you, the traveler.   When touring companies have allegiances this translates to someone else telling you where to go, when, and for how long. Wouldn't you like to visit a destination, where you're in control?  This is what Jah-Min Tours brings. Empowering the traveler.    You, as the traveler will be free to select what will make your visit to Jamaica the best travel experience.  However, this is only the beginning....</p>
<p>As the Founder, I am not only committed to delivering a personal touring experience to the traveler, but to give back to the Jamaican community by financially contributing to its elementary schools.   Its not only important to me to provide a one-of-a-kind personal experience to the traveler, but to also be charitable to its local community.  </p>
<p>My name is Syian Wignal Sr, the Founder of Jah-Min Tours, and I'm originally from Jamaica.   I migrated over a decade here to the U.S.   One of the most attractive attributes I admired of the U.S. was the entrepreneurial spirit.  In addition, I noticed what also came along with this spirit of entrepreneurship, was the charitable actions from these companies to its local community. It wasn't only the primary focus to provision a service to customers by these companies, but help the local community.    </p>
<p>In order for me to mirror the above, I thought about a service business I wanted to launch, and be able to help Jamaican elementary schools simultaneously.  I realized many touring companies provide nice, ""canned"" touring packages for the Jamaican traveler.  However, once the tour ended, the customer is left to figure on their own how to get from one destination to another.  If you were traveling, wouldn't you want to feel like you're in control of where you want to go, and when?   As travelers we all want a taste of the ""1%"" lifestyle and treatment.   Especially if you are going somewhere exotic like Jamaica!   This is where I got the idea to create a modern service that offers a unique, and personalize way of touring, and traveling thru Jamaica.</p>
<p>Each year Jamaican travel continues to increase.  In fact in 2015 it was a record breaking year for both airline and cruise liners to Jamaica! This means more ""canned"" tours at an increased cost, and cramped shuttles.  Wouldn't you, the traveler want the opposite?  Wouldn't you want it to be just you, a loved one,  or simply a small group of friends?  Wouldn't you want to see Jamaica on your schedule vs. the standard touring company package, where you fit your schedule to them?  All the while knowing a portion of what you paid is going to help elementary schools?   </p>
<p>This is what Jah-Min Tours wants to bring to you the traveler!   With such a service the traveler will feel as if they were part of the luxurious""1%'er"" lifestyle.   Wouldn't you feel refreshed and special when returning home vs. feeling if you were part of a cattle herd, and then need a vacation from your vacation?   This is what Jah-Min Tours is offering a touring\traveling experience without being part of the traveling herd.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We obviously need your assistance to get this started.  In short, we need seed money so we can accommodate the expenses below:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000 to launch and cover these expenses:<ul>
<li>Jamaican Business Regulation Fees</li>
<li>Jamaican Operating Licenses &amp; Taxes</li>
<li>Vehicle Expansion</li>
<li>Office Overhead (Its required by Jamaica to have an office) </li>
<li>Marketing Initiatives (Its required by Jamaica we have printed brochures, and uniforms)</li>
<li>Website Development</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The amount you contribute will go toward your touring\travel purchase price with us when you visit Jamaica!  (We want to meet our funders!)</li>
<li>We are aware of the risk that comes with crowdfunding.   Not all crowdfunding opportunities meet their goals.  If we do not reach our goal, depending on the amount raised we will seek other investment partners to help us complete our goal.   Your funds will still be applied to the above expenses.   We will provide transparency with our communication as we seek other investment partners.   In an extreme situation where we missed our goal by a significant amount we will return all funds.   </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will not only help us get launched, but help us disrupt the way people tour and travel Jamaica.  Most importantly, it will help us begin to help the elementary school have a better education.    Plus, they will have the opportunity to learn, and appreciate the results when successful entrepreneurship and charitable actions are partnered.   It only helps build stronger communities where disadvantages are present. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any new product or service there are risks.    Some of the risks we are aware of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A competitor realizes what we are attempting to accomplish, and attempts to duplicate.</li>
<li>Convincing competitors customers to give us a try</li>
<li>Jamaican regulation changes</li>
<li>U.S. &amp; European economic climate impacts on Jamaican tourism. </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the above risks and challenges are not within our control, but others are.   The first two serve as examples we can mitigate.  This is where our advantage lies.    It will require the standard touring and taxi companies to adjust their business model and price points, which can be costly to them.   Also, they will have to alter their brand from ""mass touring"" to providing a ""1%er"" touring and traveling experience.    This give us the edge because our brand is from the beginning to give you, the traveler the modern, personal ""1%er"" treatment.     </p>
<p>Another risk that can be mitigated is with Jamaican regulations.   I am very familiar with Jamaican regulations, how it operates, the process, and where the news is published.   This is due to time spent with Jamaican Board of Tourism.   This will help Jah-Min Tours remain informed when possible regulation(s) are gong to change.   </p>
<p>As the business climate, regulations change Jah-Min Tours will be committed to being transparent with this information to its funders by communicating such information <u>regularly</u>.</p>
<h3>Other Methods of Contributing</h3>

<p>If you are unable to contribute at this time, then all we ask is you share this page on your social media pages for others to consider funding!  IndieGogo has some share tools you can use to promote this page, so we please request for you to take advantage of such tools.  </p>
<p>Thank you very much for taking the time to read our information, and contribute.   We look forward to meeting and servicing you when you arrive in Jamaica!  </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>The land transport to and from Gili all and all requires more than 7 hours journey, in comparison to our transfer time of <u><strong><i>40 minutes</i>.</strong> </u>The land transfer would require journey within Bali (to Padang Bay), then four hours ferry, then 1 hour journey in Lombok and boat transfer for another hour from Lombok to Gili Islands.</p>
<p>Bali as the main tourism destination in Indonesia is going from strength to strength. The visitors into Bali in 2015 was totaling to 8 million, this is split between international and domestic visitors. The tourism industry is supported by better infrastructure throughout the island. The government recently completed the renovation of Ngurah Rai International airport and layover of both national and regional public roads.</p>
<p>In essence we believe that the tourism industry is sustainable in Bali therefore our business to support tourism will be viable. Our observations also indicate that the tourism sector in the nearby island such as Lombok, Sumba is growing exponentially. The Gili Island in Lombok is now one of the favourite destinations for Australians and tourists from Jakarta and other major cities in Indonesia.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>A  seaplane air transport for scenic tours is a new style of business in Bali. With a business idea such as Bali Air Adventure, we understand that we are in the early stages of start-up with high costs. Our goal is to purchase the 19 seater DHC06-Twin Otter plane outright. Therefore, we require as much raised capital towards this adventure to further commence this operation.</p>

will set out to ski the last degree to the North Pole in April 2017. The
 expedition will face many physical challenges – temperatures down to 
-40°C, polar bears and shifting pack ice - but the core purpose of the 
expedition is to foster greater dialogue and understanding between women
 from Western and Arabian cultures. In addition, the expedition will 
work to inspire all women to reach beyond the expectation of others and 
to fulfill their own ultimate life ambitions.<br/><br/>....but before they can do that, they need to learn the skills that will allow them to succeed in the Arctic. They need some training.<br/><br/><p>The expedition plans to meet for the first time and complete their first 
training expedition in Iceland during September 2016. They will spend a 
few days on the South coast of Iceland learning the skills needed to 
travel in winter conditions (camping on snow, skiing, rations, clothing) before heading out onto one of the largest 
glaciers in Europe to complete a five day training expedition. Not only will this be a vital opportunity for the women (many of whom have no previous expedition experience) 
to learn how to travel across icy terrain - but the team will also have a
 chance to bond as a group and to begin to share their experiences with 
others through the website. </p>The team are a group of women brought together  from some 1000 applicants across Europe and the Middle East.<div>
<p>The
 team ranges in age from 26 to 47 and represents a diverse variety of 
occupations, backgrounds, perspectives and levels of experience in the 
outdoors. Within the team are journalists, scientists, teachers, wives, 
mothers, businesswomen, creatives, outdoor professionals and a wide 
range of skills. What each member of the team has in common is a 
commitment to the wider community and the determination to make the 
world a better place.</p>
<p>You can meet the team on our expedition website at:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.euroarabianexpedition.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.euroarabianexpedition.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>What we need....</b><br/><br/>Every team member involved in the training expedition is committed to raising funds to pay for their own flight to Iceland and contributing something to the total cost. However, in order for it to be possible for women from all financial positions to be a part of the team, we need some help!<br/><br/>The total cost of the training expedition in Iceland will be £10,000. This includes money for food, transport in Iceland, some equipment, accommodation for the first few days of the expedition, insurance, and communications so that we can share as much as possible with those following the journey through the internet and social media - all for 13 people.<br/><br/>Any amount raised that exceeds what we need for the Iceland training expedition will be put towards the North Pole expedition in 2017. If we fail to reach our campaign target, we will still use any funds raised here and honour any promised pledges but will look to find the shortfall via other means.<br/><br/><b>What we can give in return....</b><br/><br/>An important aim of the expedition is to get as many people as possible enthused and inspired by taking them along with us on our journey. The pledges are designed to allow people to do that - either as individuals or as groups/schools/clubs. We take the pledges very seriously as a team and will work hard to make sure that they deliver a unique perspective for those that join us as virtual team members.<br/>
</div>If you are unable to support us by buying a pledge, don't worry! We'd still love to have you along on our journey by following us on social media. It would also be really useful if you could spread the world about what we are doing. <br/><br/>In particular, if you know or are associated with anyone who might be interested in becoming a sponsor of either the Iceland Training Expedition or the North Pole Expedition, please do let them know about our website!<br/></div>","Brought together by British Polar Explorer, Felicity Aston, an international team of women from across Europe and the Middle East

others through the website. The team are a group of women brought together  from some 1000 applicants across Europe and the Middle East.
The
 team ranges in age from 26 to 47 and represents a diverse variety of 
occupations, backgrounds, perspectives and levels of experience in the 
outdoors. Within the team are journalists, scientists, teachers, wives, 
mothers, businesswomen, creatives, outdoor professionals and a wide 
range of skills. What each member of the team has in common is a 
commitment to the wider community and the determination to make the 
world a better place.
You can meet the team on our expedition website at:
www.euroarabianexpedition.com

What we need....Every team member involved in the training expedition is committed to raising funds to pay for their own flight to Iceland and contributing something to the total cost. However, in order for it to be possible for women from all financial positions to be a part of the team, we need some help!The total cost of the training expedition in Iceland will be £10,000. This includes money for food, transport in Iceland, some equipment, accommodation for the first few days of the expedition, insurance, and communications so that we can share as much as possible with those following the journey through the internet and social media - all for 13 people.Any amount raised that exceeds what we need for the Iceland training expedition will be put towards the North Pole expedition in 2017. If we fail to reach our campaign target, we will still use any funds raised here and honour any promised pledges but will look to find the shortfall via other means.What we can give in return....An important aim of the expedition is to get as many people as possible enthused and inspired by taking them along with us on our journey. The pledges are designed to allow people to do that - either as individuals or as groups/schools/clubs. We take the pledges very seriously as a team and will work hard to make sure that they deliver a unique perspective for those that join us as virtual team members.
If you are unable to support us by buying a pledge, don't worry! We'd still love to have you along on our journey by following us on social media. It would also be really useful if you could spread the world about what we are doing. In particular, if you know or are associated with anyone who might be interested in becoming a sponsor of either the Iceland Training Expedition or the North Pole Expedition, please do let them know about our website!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Mounting</h3>
<p>The control unit mounts on the handlebars with a pair of slim zip ties whose heads nestle inside the base of the unit. Once it's mounted, you will only need to remove the cover to replace the coin cell battery that powers it.</p>
<p>The taillight mounts to your seat post or rack, or clip it to your saddle bag or clothing. They're light weight; Wear several! Each can be configured to work with the same control unit, and each taillight can be set for different functions (left or right turn signal, brake only, etc.) to make your intentions even more clear. Each taillight can be configured to work with multiple control units, making it easy to move the taillights from bike to bike.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are three friends who love bikes and technology. Commuting by bike has been the main means of transportation for Alex for over a decade. Having close calls with unruly drivers led to our desire to find a means to make us safer, and we've found it!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Alex Applegate<br/>Chief Executive Officer / Co-Founder</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559930206/c2vevzwen1uzj68qpdcd.png"" src="""" style=""width: 40%;""/></strong></p>
<p>With over 30 years of customer service and supply chain experience, Alex runs day to day operations. This understanding of business operations and bicycle commuting will push the company forward with successive product ideas, while keeping an eye towards continually improving the product. In his past employment at multinational high tech companies, he has handled large million dollar accounts, working with all aspects of operations from finance, sales and manufacturing, to ensure that parts are where they need to be. He intends to have a hands on approach to customer service.</p>
<p>A long time bicyclist, Alex has ridden his daily commuter bike (a Diamondback road bike, converted to a single speed) for over 50,000 miles on the streets of Dallas, TX and Albuquerque, NM, where he now lives. As a result, he knows the needs and constraints placed upon cyclists and this vision has shaped the Warthog's development. He is currently restoring a 1972 Raleigh Grand Prix, and hopes to ride it in an Eroica, which he is working to create here in New Mexico.<br/> </p>

<p>Before becoming CTO at rfCYCLE, Jeff accumulated thirty-five years of R&amp;D experience in a variety of challenging projects from designing flight-control systems manufactured in New Mexico to producing wireless consumer devices assembled in China. As president of his own electronic product design company for twenty years, Jeff designed and manufactured a multitude of custom wireless devices for customers across the USA.  Since Jeff's childhood, the thought of becoming an electrical engineer, designing electronic circuits and being a major contributor in running a successful business was always in the forefront.  Today, as CTO of rfCYCLE, Jeff is excited to be taking yet another step up on the ladder of success.</p>
<p>After graduating from college in electrical engineering, Jeff moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to work for one of the largest aerospace companies in the country. Always an athlete growing up in Kansas, Jeff became a member of Albuquerque's premier adult runners club, Nosotros, and subsequently found a love for competitive swimming and bicycle riding after moving to sunny southern California. Since competing in foot races, biathlons, and triathlons in the mountains of New Mexico and on the beaches of California, Jeff has settled into a slightly less competitive  lifestyle yet continues to enjoy running, swimming, and cycling on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Presently living in New Mexico again, and training for yet another triathlon, Jeff looks forward to seeing a  new generation of cyclists being protected by the products designed and  manufactured by rfCYCLE.<br/> </p>

<p>Before becoming COO at rfCYCLE, Richard amassed 45 years of industrial electronics experience in steel mills, forge shops, oil and gas, and rf identification in railroad automatic equipment identification around the country. As the director of manufacturing, his experience and demanding eye for detail has made product development move forward with continuous improvement. Richard's strict hand will be there to assure high standards from all our vendors and lead to a quality product for all our customers.</p>
<p>Born and educated in Western New York, Richard settled in Los Alamos, NM. One of his joys is taking his friends, not accustomed to the 7000 feet altitude, on the trails around town on his old Nishiki.</p>
<h3>Where we are in the process.</h3>
<p>We have spent the past several years developing the product and working with our suppliers to hone the product into something of which we are very proud. All the images and videos that you see were shot using manufacturing samples. We are happy, our suppliers are happy, and we are ready to place our first orders. Assembled in the USA.</p>

<h3>Thanks to all our supporters!</h3>
<p>This project has taken years and a ton of gray hairs to reach this point. Our friends and families have had to deal with our efforts, our ceaseless talking about the product and have been there with us through all the setbacks and victories to help us push forward to completion. To them, we owe a debt we can never repay. We have also been amazed by extraordinary help provided by the people below (a horribly incomplete list):</p>
<p>Josh Perkins (jperkins333@gmail.com) for his amazing design work. He is the one that created all the sexy molded plastic parts and overcame problems that caused redesigns to make the product close to perfection. His hand holding through these times were invaluable. </p>
<p>Diane Albert (<a href=""http://dianealbertlaw.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dianealbertlaw.com/</a> ), our patent attorney. It turns out that she is not only one kick-ass attorney, but is also a serious bike advocate who immediately believed in our product, and has worked hard, outside her role as attorney, to help move us down this path.</p>
<p>Ignatius Fischer from Witness Pictures (<a href=""http://www.witnesspictures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.witnesspictures.com</a>) . The man is a genius with a camera. Most of the images and pictures (and shooting a glowing red light is tougher than you think!) in this campaign and on our website were made by this man. </p>
<p>And speaking of websites, we would be at a loss without the efforts of Andrew Taylor from Wirewood Consulting (<a href=""https://wirewoodnm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wirewoodnm.com/</a> ). He not only made the rfCYCLE website a thing of beauty, but made this campaign something worth viewing.</p>
<p>And finally, thank you in advance to everyone who is supporting this campaign. We have self-funded this project from the start, leaving us very little money for advertising. Your interest, your sharing (pretty please) of this campaign with others (and maybe even, you know, getting a Warthog), are essential to its success. We could not go forward without you, and we know it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Production Photos</h3>
<p>Dear Will from Indiegogo:</p>
<p>Indiegogo's stated definition of manufactured is this:</p>
<p>“You have begun the process of turning the prototype into a mass-produced product. In order to be approved for Production, you need to provide clear evidence that your product is being manufactured. Some ways to highlight your current stage of production include non-rendered photographic evidence of production runs, tooling, molds, manufactured components “</p>
<p>Photographic evidence of production runs include every photo and video on this page, along with the photos below of manufactured components. If you looks closely at the interior shots, you can see the molding marks.</p>
<p>Thanks! Alex</p>

Stop, just stop. We all have to - wouldn't it be great if the car behind you knew you were going to brake before your paths met? Our taillight switches from a flash pattern to all lights active, looking just like the brake light all drivers are used to seeing.
 

Turn Signal
There's only one hand gesture cars recognize. Who can see them in the dark?  Our Warthog system not only indicates when you are braking, but also indicates when and in which direction you are turning!









 
Flash Pattern
We have 4 flash patterns.








Low, with a pattern of 2 lights, can run for 33 hours,

Medium, with a pattern of 4 lights, can run for 23 hours,



High flash, with a pattern of alternating 8 and 4 lights flashing can run for 14 hours,

While Our Ultra flash has all 12 lights flashing.


Pssst! There's a super secret fifth flash pattern with no flashing lights running, which adds extra emphasis to the brake and turn signals. Don't use this unless you have another light running!

The taillight is also smart enough to remember which pattern you used the time before.
Mounting
The control unit mounts on the handlebars with a pair of slim zip ties whose heads nestle inside the base of the unit. Once it's mounted, you will only need to remove the cover to replace the coin cell battery that powers it.
The taillight mounts to your seat post or rack, or clip it to your saddle bag or clothing. They're light weight; Wear several! Each can be configured to work with the same control unit, and each taillight can be set for different functions (left or right turn signal, brake only, etc.) to make your intentions even more clear. Each taillight can be configured to work with multiple control units, making it easy to move the taillights from bike to bike.











 
Technical Details


Who We Are
We are three friends who love bikes and technology. Commuting by bike has been the main means of transportation for Alex for over a decade. Having close calls with unruly drivers led to our desire to find a means to make us safer, and we've found it!
Alex ApplegateChief Executive Officer / Co-Founder

With over 30 years of customer service and supply chain experience, Alex runs day to day operations. This understanding of business operations and bicycle commuting will push the company forward with successive product ideas, while keeping an eye towards continually improving the product. In his past employment at multinational high tech companies, he has handled large million dollar accounts, working with all aspects of operations from finance, sales and manufacturing, to ensure that parts are where they need to be. He intends to have a hands on approach to customer service.
A long time bicyclist, Alex has ridden his daily commuter bike (a Diamondback road bike, converted to a single speed) for over 50,000 miles on the streets of Dallas, TX and Albuquerque, NM, where he now lives. As a result, he knows the needs and constraints placed upon cyclists and this vision has shaped the Warthog's development. He is currently restoring a 1972 Raleigh Grand Prix, and hopes to ride it in an Eroica, which he is working to create here in New Mexico. 
Jeff WeaverChief Technology Officer / Co-Founder

Before becoming CTO at rfCYCLE, Jeff accumulated thirty-five years of R&D experience in a variety of challenging projects from designing flight-control systems manufactured in New Mexico to producing wireless consumer devices assembled in China. As president of his own electronic product design company for twenty years, Jeff designed and manufactured a multitude of custom wireless devices for customers across the USA.  Since Jeff's childhood, the thought of becoming an electrical engineer, designing electronic circuits and being a major contributor in running a successful business was always in the forefront.  Today, as CTO of rfCYCLE, Jeff is excited to be taking yet another step up on the ladder of success.
After graduating from college in electrical engineering, Jeff moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to work for one of the largest aerospace companies in the country. Always an athlete growing up in Kansas, Jeff became a member of Albuquerque's premier adult runners club, Nosotros, and subsequently found a love for competitive swimming and bicycle riding after moving to sunny southern California. Since competing in foot races, biathlons, and triathlons in the mountains of New Mexico and on the beaches of California, Jeff has settled into a slightly less competitive  lifestyle yet continues to enjoy running, swimming, and cycling on a regular basis.
Presently living in New Mexico again, and training for yet another triathlon, Jeff looks forward to seeing a  new generation of cyclists being protected by the products designed and  manufactured by rfCYCLE. 
Richard SkotnickiChief Operations Officer / Co-Founder 
Before becoming COO at rfCYCLE, Richard amassed 45 years of industrial electronics experience in steel mills, forge shops, oil and gas, and rf identification in railroad automatic equipment identification around the country. As the director of manufacturing, his experience and demanding eye for detail has made product development move forward with continuous improvement. Richard's strict hand will be there to assure high standards from all our vendors and lead to a quality product for all our customers.
Born and educated in Western New York, Richard settled in Los Alamos, NM. One of his joys is taking his friends, not accustomed to the 7000 feet altitude, on the trails around town on his old Nishiki.
Where we are in the process.
We have spent the past several years developing the product and working with our suppliers to hone the product into something of which we are very proud. All the images and videos that you see were shot using manufacturing samples. We are happy, our suppliers are happy, and we are ready to place our first orders. Assembled in the USA.

Thanks to all our supporters!
This project has taken years and a ton of gray hairs to reach this point. Our friends and families have had to deal with our efforts, our ceaseless talking about the product and have been there with us through all the setbacks and victories to help us push forward to completion. To them, we owe a debt we can never repay. We have also been amazed by extraordinary help provided by the people below (a horribly incomplete list):
Josh Perkins (jperkins333@gmail.com) for his amazing design work. He is the one that created all the sexy molded plastic parts and overcame problems that caused redesigns to make the product close to perfection. His hand holding through these times were invaluable. 
Diane Albert (http://dianealbertlaw.com/ ), our patent attorney. It turns out that she is not only one kick-ass attorney, but is also a serious bike advocate who immediately believed in our product, and has worked hard, outside her role as attorney, to help move us down this path.
Ignatius Fischer from Witness Pictures (http://www.witnesspictures.com) . The man is a genius with a camera. Most of the images and pictures (and shooting a glowing red light is tougher than you think!) in this campaign and on our website were made by this man. 
And speaking of websites, we would be at a loss without the efforts of Andrew Taylor from Wirewood Consulting (https://wirewoodnm.com/ ). He not only made the rfCYCLE website a thing of beauty, but made this campaign something worth viewing.
And finally, thank you in advance to everyone who is supporting this campaign. We have self-funded this project from the start, leaving us very little money for advertising. Your interest, your sharing (pretty please) of this campaign with others (and maybe even, you know, getting a Warthog), are essential to its success. We could not go forward without you, and we know it.
 
Production Photos
Dear Will from Indiegogo:
Indiegogo's stated definition of manufactured is this:
“You have begun the process of turning the prototype into a mass-produced product. In order to be approved for Production, you need to provide clear evidence that your product is being manufactured. Some ways to highlight your current stage of production include non-rendered photographic evidence of production runs, tooling, molds, manufactured components “
Photographic evidence of production runs include every photo and video on this page, along with the photos below of manufactured components. If you looks closely at the interior shots, you can see the molding marks.
Thanks! Alex",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","2 years ago, we brought you The World's Smallest EDC Flashlight. We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.

When we say ""World's Smallest"", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   

 
It's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. 







This material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  
Using a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.

Have a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  

The tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  


At Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  

The earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.

In 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  

When we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.

   
Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.

Add it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  

Need less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  

Never lose your pen again.   
  
 

 
 


They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  

 
 
 

   
 
We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.
 

In order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  



   
SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.",35.0,0,"7 Campaigns

  While diving NEMO in a pool, all you need is the built-in flotation foam. Our high visibility flotation tube and dive flag should always be used in lakes, oceans and rivers – safety first! 
  This feature-rich backpack was designed specifically to carry NEMO wherever the call of the water beckons. These stylish packs are made out of textilene – a sturdy and resilient material that looks great too. Intelligently-designed straps and pockets all around the bag keep your NEMO neat and tidy.

Be sure to grab a few extra packs so that you can dive all day long! The Flotation FoamNEMO’s flotation foam is made of cross-linked polyethylene and is shaped with a computer numerical control cutting machine. The foam is designed to give NEMO inherent buoyancy while keeping the main compressor unit in the water for cooling purposes. The Flotation TubeDesigned to give NEMO extra stability and visibility in open-water settings such as the ocean, the flotation tube provides an additional 22 pounds of buoyancy and is brightly colored so that family, friends, and by-passers can easily spot your location while you’re diving. The tube inflates with only two breaths and similarly deflates with ease. Not diving in an open-water setting like an ocean or lake? NEMO will float just fine without the flotation tube! The Air HoseNEMO’s 10-foot air hose is the perfect balance of weight, flexibility, and durability. The coils prevent the hose from kinking and make it super easy to handle. The buoyancy of the hose allows excess to float on the surface so that it stays clear of you, the marine environment, and other divers underwater.  Meet the BLU3 Team:
 
  Our systems make diving really simple. Our mission is to get as many people as we can to fall in love with the water. Why? Because the more people who love our waters, the more people who will help protect it.Our BLU3 divers can contribute to the Project Baseline database using cameras and dive computers. Right now, the sign up process is a little complicated (we’re working on it) but the data you provide is invaluable – you’ll seriously be making a difference.The goal is to prevent “Environmental Amnesia” – a term used to describe the unnoticed decline of ocean health over decades. We have to keep track of what is happening in order to stop it from happening. 
Training Each NEMO will include a comprehensive training program that covers safety and best practices of both snorkeling and scuba diving. These lessons will also be available on our website to be reviewed at any time.Know when your battery is low NEMO features a software-controlled low-battery routine that is designed to slowly reduce depth performance so that users will gradually feel the need to conclude the dive. The Buddy System An important rule to diving of any kind is to never dive alone. So convince a buddy or a group of friends to go in on one of our 2 or 6-unit rewards and dive BLU3 together!  Download our video in hi-res, find content to make your own, and learn more about us.",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b><i>Nothing can be simpler than cooking with ecoo</i></b></p>
<p>ecoo sets up in less than 20 seconds &amp; once you orient it towards Sun, <br/>You need not monitor again.</p>
<p>No need to stir the food, adjust the orientation or worry about <br/>food getting overcooked. <br/>Because ecoo has been designed to <b>cook for You with minimum attention</b>.</p>
<p>The reflector design allows ecoo to capture Sunrays for around 3 hours <br/>and the proprietary heat accumulator ensures that the temperature never exceeds 120 deg C, thereby ensuring that the food never burns or gets overcooked. </p>
<p>In fact, the <b>food will stay warm for 3 hours</b> even after it has been cooked<br/>so you can Stroll in the Park, meet Friends, play Tennis and come back home to be greeted with Hot &amp; Fresh food.</p>

<blockquote><b>Solar cooked food is Fundamentally Nutritious, Naturally Flavorful  &amp; Heavenly Aromatic</b></blockquote>
<p>Nutrient retention is inversely proportional to cooking temperature <br/>and hence, higher the temperature faster is the cooking process, <br/>but most of the nutrients are destroyed.</p>
<p>Lower the temperature, slower is the cooking process <br/>but higher are the Nutrients retained.</p>
<p>The <b>maximum temperature</b> in ecoo never exceeds <b>120 deg C</b> (250 deg F) <br/>and hence almost all of the nutrients are retained.</p>

So, allow us to take You through this Exciting Journey of scaling the impossible mountain far beyond the World Record, with 100,000 adventurers Solar Cooking on the same dayAnd how it will impact all of us.Here we Go
Solar Cooking is the best way there is to Cook FoodNothing summarizes this more beautifully than the below verses ""Influenced are our Minds by the Food we eat & influenced is the Food by the Method we cook it""                                   ""food cooked in the Vicinity of Sun & Air                                   is the gateway to stay youthful, joyful & healthier""                                                                           Charak Samhita, Ayurveda

World's only Solar Cooker that sits on Your Palmtop

and assembles in less than 20 seconds!




Small yet Powerful, Simple yet Elegant & Compact yet DurableCarry it in your Office, Gym, Family Outing, Swimming Pool, wherever You Goecoo will cook wonders for You as long as the Sun shines!


Nothing can be simpler than cooking with ecoo
ecoo sets up in less than 20 seconds & once you orient it towards Sun, You need not monitor again.
No need to stir the food, adjust the orientation or worry about food getting overcooked. Because ecoo has been designed to cook for You with minimum attention.
The reflector design allows ecoo to capture Sunrays for around 3 hours and the proprietary heat accumulator ensures that the temperature never exceeds 120 deg C, thereby ensuring that the food never burns or gets overcooked. 
In fact, the food will stay warm for 3 hours even after it has been cookedso you can Stroll in the Park, meet Friends, play Tennis and come back home to be greeted with Hot & Fresh food.
Isn't that Exciting?

Prepare Hot & Refreshing Soup on top of Snowy Mountainsor relish healthiest breakfast right after Swimming in the Sea
Carry Your ecoo anywhere & Cook on the Go!
You can also pasteurize water to make it safe for drinking, thereby making ecoo a valuable asset in all your travels.
You can also use it to keep your food warm or dehydrate some fruits & vegetables to increase their shelf life. 



Surprise Yourself by Cooking Vivid recipes with ecoo 

Boil without Water - eggs, green vegetables, sweet corn, potatoes, tomatoes 

Bake without Fire - Cakes, Breads, Cookies, Dhoklas


Roast without stirring - Nuts, Flour, Grains, Rava 

Cook Oil Free Poha, Upma, Sabudana Khichadi, Pulao
Serve Soup, Green Tea, Noodles, Pasta in Sun Rich Flavors

And anything that can be done in slow heat & low temperatures.





Experience the Power of Simplicity when a Child gets his hands on ecoo and begins imagining an entirely different world

ecoo's extreme simplicity fosters creativity, challenges Intellect & builds Scientific Temper by inviting the Child to first Play with it (Explore), understand the fundamentals by cooking variety of recipes at different time & day (Experience), document the results & then share the learning with others (Express)
It also invites the child to find other uses of ecoo and then kindle their imagination in simplifying other technologies & building better products for a Happier, Healthier & All Inclusive World.



Nothing boosts the confidence more than cooking your own food Independently!
There is something Magical in seeing someone cook for the first time. And if it's being done without gas or electricity, no words can describe it.
The Joy on the faces of children when they first cook with Sun is unparalleled and so contagious is their zeal to share the experience with friends, family & everyone that you'll be mesmerized at the potential & possibilities of this simple Solar Toy. There can't be a better Birthday Gift than a perfect Sun Baked Cake topped with lots of Love, Care & Blessings 


Bake surprisingly soft cakes, fluffy breads & crunchy cookies with seductive aroma & tempting flavors and become the face of any celebration you plan to join.


Solar cooked food is Fundamentally Nutritious, Naturally Flavorful  & Heavenly Aromatic
Nutrient retention is inversely proportional to cooking temperature and hence, higher the temperature faster is the cooking process, but most of the nutrients are destroyed.
Lower the temperature, slower is the cooking process but higher are the Nutrients retained.
The maximum temperature in ecoo never exceeds 120 deg C (250 deg F) and hence almost all of the nutrients are retained.
So, in a world already filled with toxic chemicals & adulteration, isn't it vital to squeeze every bit of essential nutrients present in our food
How about growing our next gen as the Solar Generation with the very first bite served to the baby being cooked by the Sun!





3.5 Million people die every year from Indoor Cooking Smoke - World Health Organization (WHO)
Collecting firewood & then using it to cook food is one of the most neglected yet hazardous reason affecting Human health & basic lifestyle growth. 
WHO states that the smoke resulting from burning wood in kitchen is equal to consuming 20 cigarettes per day, thereby severely affecting lungs & eyes.


The Health & Economic impact is far severe than the Environmental impact and Solar Cookers can play a vital role in reducing if not totally eliminate the same
____________________________________________________________
Technical Details____________________________________________________________
Raw Materials

We've chosen the most modern materials for making ecoo. The weatherproof world class materials ensure that ecoo will last for years with no maintenance other than cleaning off the dust on its reflector!

Cooking time for some common recipes

Cooking time is actually a factor of Solar intensity (which in turn is dependent on time of day and day of the year), type & quantity of food and amount of water (if required)
 

Every curve and every crease in ecoo has been designed to invite you in playing with it. After all Playfulness is Mindfulness & Mindfulness is the essence of Creativity!


So let us now begin our expedition to climb that mountain of impossibility - celebrating World's Largest Solar Festival with 100,000+ individuals from across the world, empower the minds of millions with happy possibilities and in effect surpass the Guinness World Record.
But first, lets explore the base camp.




SuryaKumbh - a Sanskrit word literally meaning 'a festive gathering celebrating the power of the Sun'
It obviously is the name of the Solar Festival we've been hosting for past 4 years.


It all started in 2012 with 42 school children, when in a span of two days they absorbed the art & science of harnessing solar energy through different routes and then put it to use by crafting their very own solar cookers. 

Each one of them cooked different recipe to showcase the potential & possibilities of Solar energy.Chocolate & Vanilla Cake from the very first SuryaKumbh


While the children began with lots of skepticism (touching the utensil every now & then to see if at least it's getting hot enough...forget cooking), eventually when the time arrived to open the cooking vessels, their eyes lit up with Joy and faces glittered with blissful happiness.

But more than the Children, it was the proud & excitement of Parents, Teachers & the Principal that made us realize that the experience is Powerful & needs to be shared with everyone possible.

And thus began the Journey of creating World's Largest Solar Festival, whose essence is nicely captured in this 2 minute photo story.Over the years we learned from the participants, refined the design of the solar cooker being used and fine tuned the Festival to be replicated anywhere at any scale with equal Thrill, Joy & Satisfaction.



And we call it Festival, because it excites the participants

Brings everyone closer, irrespective of the age
Inspires them to Think Different




and propagates a social message





by Expanding their Vision





Hence, we could reach over 100,000 direct participants from small tribal village of Jawahar to Ultra Modern City of Dubai






and in the process also create World Records.





Which is why we also got featured in many digital & print media

But the real reward of making a World Record lies not in the record or publicitybut the way it beautifully transforms the outlook of Participants & Organizerstowards goals, team work, success and LIFE itself. 



Because once they become part of creating something big, rare and beyond social set standards, it's difficult to ever think small again.Imagine if millions of children can live through such experience of breaking existing realities, would anything stop them from dreaming the impossible? 


It'd be lot like planting Wings to their Imagination
And that's the exact possibility that excites & inspires us to go beyond.


So, WHAT exactly is this beyond the World Records thing?Well when we started with SuryaKumbh, the Guinness World Record for Largest Solar Oven Cooking Class was 250 participants.
We attempted to break it with 2250 participants in 2013 and eventually bettered it incrementally with 3639 in 2014 & with 4780 in 2016.
Now, the thing we realized is the bigger the festival & more the people associated with it, higher is the learning, sense of fulfillment and the overall impact.And we think that is true with every Festival.
So, instead of continuing with focusing on a single venue festivals with incremental impact, we posed ourselves with a crazy idea of doing it with 100,000 participants across the globe, but on the same day.
Never before has a ""technical"" festival been held at such a scale, forget about registering as World Record and that is really motivating.
In fact the very idea of visualizing 100,000 enthusiasts doing something together is heart stopping and brings lot of excitement with fear of how it can be done.
But of course it can. And we have been planning this for a year now.
So, here is HOW we intend to do it.


Reach passionate & fun loving individuals to enroll as participants at special price through Indiegogo. 
Simultaneously run an offline campaign with our partner NGOs to reach tribal children and generate funds for them

This help us build that initial momentum & funds required for tooling & commencing production.

The first lot ships in late August
The balance ships in September
We celebrate the festival in Mid October

<p>The Arkyne Tech group is presenting a new innovative investment challenge to develop Geoo. These personal geo-localizers are not only small and efficient, they are also flexible stickers and reach all kinds of distances. Using GPS and bluetooth technologies, every geoo device is able to send its precise position directly to your smartphone and sketch it on a real time map and radar.Our development team has been working on the idea during the last 6 months until we finally acomplished the final designs. Right now, Geoo is more than an idea. However, in order to reach the next step of our plan and be able to finish its entire development we need your help.  One of our main goals is to achieve the most affordable and cheapest price in the market while keeping the highest possible quality. This needs a high starting budget to adquire the most efficient manufacturing and distribution processes. That's why we decided to open this crowdfunding campaign, we appreciate all the support we are receiving and we thank every single person who trusted our project.</p>

<p>Geoo uses a simple Bluetooth connection for short distances, and GPS for longer ones. We have optimized the technology taking part in Geoo, so we are sure about providing the best connection as possible with the user. We are launching 2 different models of Geoo, based on your basic needs. Firstly, Geoo Home, thought for a smaller radius of use, such as a house or a store. Geoo Home is built with a Bluetooth based communication system, easily connectable with many compatible devices. Open the app and Geoo Home will show on a radar where it´s located precisely.</p>
<p></p>

<p><span>But if Geoo Home doesn´t provide the enough range of use you were looking for, worry no more, because we also present Geoo Pro, the advanced version of our first product. With Geoo Pro you can forget about distance barriers, forget about the optimal connection range. We provide coverage for your whole country´s territory. Whether you go on a trip and want to protect your car or luggage, or if you want to make sure your pet or your most vulnerable family members are well protected, Geoo Pro offers more than a wide enough radius for you to be able to track them with your devices. The gps localizer is easily tracked down and displayed on a detailed map so you can be sure that you recover whatever you are looking for.</span><br/></p>

<p>We think it would be great to always have localized all our valuable items and possesions. However, we tend to lose many things around our house, car, workplace, etc. So, why not place a Geoo on everything you really need in your daily life and easily find it with a simple search? Why would you waste time looking for anything when you could use Geoo and find it in seconds?</p>

<p>We will be using a battery that will last over 12 months, providing for a more than enough life cycle for your Geoo. Furthermore, our batteries can be recharged if needed by an induction system. The Bluetooth has a very low power consumption rate,  however it is not a condition for it to reduce its effectivity. As well, optimizing performance is key for all the new technology for it to work at its best, without reducing the user experience. We provide an update rate of your location optimized for the product we are selling. Our refresh rate is set to 1 minute for the Home version, and the amazing 0.5s for the Pro edition, more than an enough accurate time interval for you to localize and track down your Geoo, and with it, your belongings.</p>

<p>The working radius of Geoo Home is also revolutionary. The area fully covered by Geoo Home is of 15000m², sufficient for any Home user to find their device. And you might be wondering, what will happen if I leave this area? Very interesting question with a very easy solution. A notification alert will immediately display on your smartphone, warning you about the distance issue. From there on, you can start the localizing process of your Geoo, or maybe use another interesting feature we have implemented. You can use Geoo Home as a map pin which will save for you to find it later on. For example, leave a Geoo Home in your car when you are going to work, save its location in the map, and you will be able to find it later on when you return.</p>

<p>Geoo is also very compact. Size has been key for this project. We have taken our designs to the limit, allowing enough space for all the components to fit adequately inside, but without forgetting the need for it to be as slim and tight as it could possibly be. This allows the user to hide a Geoo nearly anywhere without using up much space.</p>

<p>Prize is also one of our advantages against all the other trackers out on sale. All the other devices ask for a monthly cost for the tracking system to fully function, but we don´t. Our users don´t have to pay for more than the device itself.

<p></p>
<p>Many are the ways of tracking down a device, but we thought that the easiest and most user-friendly would have to be an app for your smartphone. Find it in your smartphone´s app store and synchronize your Geoo with your phone by inserting its unique ID code. Nothing else is required. You can add several Geoos to the same phone, easily switching from one to another in a very intuitive menu. By default, your Geoos will have stock names. Simply edit them and name them whatever you like, for example keys, bag or wallet. And you are all done and ready to start finding!</p>

</h1>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Indiegogo? Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>We are a still growing technology based company, and crowdfunding offers the possibility to almost everyone to be recognized as well as valuing their work and ideas. This way, Indiegogo seems to be the perfect spot for us to show our ideas to the world.</p>
<p><b>Is Geoo protected in any way?</b></p>
<p>Of course! We have designed Geoo for it to be as durable as it can possibly be. This way, Geoo is waterproof and dust resistant, to make sure that it will continue functioning correctly even if it gets wet or dirty. Our International Protection Marking is set to IP-65, resisting any type of solid particle and water jets. </p>
<br/><p><b>When do we start shipping?</b><br/></p>
<p>Once our campaigns have ended successfully and reached our set goals, we will start with our mass production phase, and around 2 to 3 months later, we will start delivering all Geoo devices. </p>
<p><b>How much is the shipping for the rewards?</b></p>
<p>Every reward which includes the delivery of Geoo´s have been assigned a certain shipping cost. To fully acknowledge the total cost of each reward, we recommend reading all the information posted about them specifically.</p>
<br/><p><b>What will be the price for the smartphone app?</b><br/></p>
<p> It´s totally free! Our goal is to simplify as much as possible the process of tracking your Geoo, so an easy-to-install app from your phone´s operating system´s store</p>
<br/><p><b>Does Geoo need a maintenance of some kind?</b></p>
<p>Geoo is fully functional whether you clean it or not. No taking care is needed on Geoo, just place it wherever you think it is needed, and enjoy the precise tracking system.</p>
<br/><p><b>Will Geoo be available in my country?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we plan on maintaining a worldwide shipping system to provide everyone with their own Geoo.</p>
<br/><p><b>What devices can I use to find my Geoos?</b></p>
<p>Any device which is Bluetooth compatible is able to track down the Geoo Home. We think it was our best shot at finding a communication channel that most of the users are familiar with and can have an easy access to. As well, Internet based connection can be made with basically any device, narrowing down even more the user´s requirements to fully use the Geoo´s tracking experience. </p>
<br/><p><b>Could anyone track my personal Geoo?</b></p>
<p>Our design is made for each Geoo to have a unique identification code that will only be given to the tracker’s owner. Therefore, nobody will know your Geoo´s ID code and it will be totally confidential. Furthermore, our faultless system is hack-proof by implementing a 32-bit encryption for the code.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why do we only offer Geoo Home in our perks?</b></p>
<p>So far, Geoo Home is our big goal to accomplish. This way, we thought about launching the basic model of Geoo first, and if everything continues going as planned, we intend on launching our advanced version of Geoo, the Pro version. Speaking about the Geoo Pro, we have included some discount codes in our reward system for some specific donations, mainly because they will be a great help for our development and feel the need to compensate in some way our trustful investors. </p>
<br/><p><b>Will Geoo be flexible?</b></p>
<p>Our latest designs have proved that it would be much more expensive and harder to obtain a flexibility state in our Geoos. However, we thought that adding the water and dust resistance was prior to flexibility and so we did.</p>
<br/><p><b>Is my Geoo ID code unique?</b></p>
<p>Of course it is! Every Geoo device has its own, unique ID code. This way no synchronization issues can occur and you can fell totally safe when using your Geoo, nobody else can track it down.</p>
<br/><p><b>Does Geoo apply a monthly cost for its use?</b></p>
<p>No. Geoo has been designed to be used without having to pay anything else rather than the device itself. We consider it was key for the costs to cause the least impact on the user as possible.</p>
<br/><p><b>Is Geoo our only project?</b></p>
<p>Certainly not. We have been simultaneously developing Geoo but also starting to think, plan and design many more appealing projects which we will surely end up displaying and explaining.

<div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Refunds' Policy:</b></p>
<p>Arkyne Technologies does not assume any responsibility of the perks' delivery in case we don't reach our economical goal; however, we will send the money back to every person who bought a perk and asks for it to be returned (in a maximum time limit of 1 month after the closing of this campaign) A 9% will be subtracted from the total refund due to Indiegogo's taxes and management expenses. Refunds may delay from 30 to 40 days time.</p>

El grupo Arkyne Tech presenta un nuevo reto de inversión para desarrollar Geoo. Estos geolocalizadores no son únicamente compactos y eficientes, sino que también son flexibles y funcionales a distancias superiores. Haciendo uso de las tecnologías Bluetooth y GPS, cada dispositivo Geoo puede enviar su posición con precisión directamente a tu smartphone y mostrarlo a tiempo real en un mapa o radar. Nuestro equipo de desarrollo ha estado trabajando en esta idea durante los últimos 6 meses hasta que finalmente hemos conseguido finalizar nuestros diseños. Actualmente, Geoo es más que una idea. Sin embargo, para poder alcanzar nuestra siguiente fase y poder terminar por completo el desarrollo necesitamos de tu ayuda. Uno de nuestros principales objetivos es mantener nuestro precio lo más bajo posible, sin que ellos afecte a un servicio de máxima calidad. Esto necesita de una inversión inicial más elevada, para poder asegurar mayor eficiencia en los procesos de producción y distribución. Por ello hemos elegido abrir esta campaña de crowdfunding, agradecemos todo el apoyo que estamos recibiendo y a todos los que confiaron en nuestro proyecto.<p></p>

<div><span>Geoo usa una conexión Bluetooth para distancias cortas, y GPS para distancias mayores. Hemos optimizado la tecnología desarrollando Geoo, por ello, estamos seguros de que ofrecemos la mejor conexión posible con el usuario. Contamos con dos modelos de Geoo basados en tus necesidades. En primer lugar, Geoo Home, pensado para un rango de uso doméstico o para tu almacén o tienda. Geoo Home tiene incorporado un sistema de conexión Bluetooth, fácilmente enlazable con multitud de dispositivos disponibles. Abre la app y Geoo Home mostrará en un radar su ubicación exacta.</span></div>

<span>Pero si Geoo Home no te proporciona un radio de uso suficiente, no te preocupes, porque te presentamos Geoo Pro, la versión avanzada de nuestro primer producto. Con Geoo Pro te puedes olvidar de las distancias límite y el radio de conexión óptimo, ya que ofrece cobertura en todo el territorio nacional de tu país. Si te vas de excursión y quieres tener controlado tu coche o equipaje, o si te quieres asegurar de que tu mascota o algún familiar estén localizados, Geoo Pro tiene un radio de uso más que suficiente para que seas capaz de saber dónde se encuentran. El localizador GPS es fácilmente rastreado y se presenta en un mapa detallado para que encuentres lo que buscas con total seguridad.</span><br/>

<p><span>Sería genial tener siempre localizados todos nuestros objetos importantes y pertenencias personales. Sin embargo, tendemos a perder muchas cosas por casa, en el coche o en el trabajo.

<span>La batería que usaremos tiene una duración estimada de más de 12 meses, proporcionando así una vida útil más que suficiente para tu Geoo. Además, nuestras baterías son recargables mediante inducción. La tecnología Bluetooth usada tiene un consumo muy reducido, pero ello no significa que disminuya su efectividad. La optimización del sistema es clave para que todos los nuevos productos tecnológicos funcionen al máximo rendimiento, sin entorpecer la experiencia hacia el usuario. Nosotros proporcionamos una frecuencia de refresco de la ubicación de 1 minuto para el Geoo Home, y de unos increíbles 0.5 segundos para la versión Pro, más que suficiente para que el cliente pueda localizar su Geoo, y con él, sus bienes.</span><br/><p></p></span><p></p>

<br/>
<p><span>El radio de funcionamiento de Geoo Home es totalmente revolucionario. Geoo Home puede cubrir un área total de 15000 m². Y te puedes estar preguntando, ¿qué ocurre si me alejo de esta zona? Una muy buena pregunta que tiene una muy fácil respuesta. Una notificación alertará inmediatamente al usuario en su smartphone, avisándole de la situación. Desde ahí el usuario decide cómo proceder, si iniciar la búsqueda del Geoo, o quizás hacer uso de una nueva característica implementada en los Geoo. Puedes usar los Geoo Home como marcador en tu mapa que se guardará para que lo puedas encontrar más tarde. Por ejemplo. Deja tu Geoo Home en el coche cuando vayas a trabajar y marca su localización en el mapa, para que cuando vuelvas más tarde al coche, lo tengas localizado en tu mapa personal.</span></p>

<p>Muchas son las formas de conectarse con el dispositivo para poder localizarlo. Sin embargo, hemos pensado que la forma más cómoda para todos los usuarios es mediante aplicaciones de smartphone. Simplemente busca nuestra aplicación dedicada a Geoo y sincronízalo introduciendo el código identificativo de tu Geoo. Así de sencillo y rápido. También puedes añadir más de un Geoo al mismo terminal, seleccionando entre uno y otro con un intuitivo menú de selección. Para simplificar la selección, modifica el nombre del Geoo que trae por defecto, y llamalo cualquier cosa, por ejemplo, llaves o mochila. ¡Todo listo para empezar a buscar tus Geoos!</p>

<div>
<p><b>¿Por qué Indiegogo? ¿Por qué crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>Somos una empresa joven y en crecimiento basados en el diseño y desarrollo de tecnología, y el crowdfunding nos ofrece rápidamente la posibilidad de ser conocidos y que todos puedan valorar nuestro trabajo e ideas. De esta forma, Indiegogo parece el portal de crowdfunding idóneo para mostrar nuestro trabajo al resto del mundo.</p>
<p><b>¿Con qué protecciones cuenta Geoo?</b></p>
<p>Hemos diseñado Geoo de forma que sea lo más duradero posible. Para ello, Geoo es resistente al agua y polvo, para asegurarnos de que continue funcionando correctamente aun si se moja o ensucia. Nuestro Grado de Proteccion IP es de IP-65, resistiendo chorros de agua y partículas sólidas de cualquier tipo.</p>
<p><b>¿Cuándo comenzarán los envíos de Geoo?</b></p>
<p>Una vez hayan finalizado nuestras campañas con éxito y se hayan cumplido nuestros objetivos, comenzaremos la producción en masa, para poder empezar a enviar los Geoo entre 2 y 3 meses después. </p>
<p><b>¿Cuál es el coste de envío en las recompensas?</b></p>
<p>Cada recompensa que tiene asignada la entrega de un Geoo tiene cierto coste de envío. Para poder conocer al detalle dichos costes, recomendamos consultar la información específica de cada recompensa.</p>
<p><b>¿Qué precio tendrá la aplicación de Geoo para móvil?</b></p>
<p>¡Ninguno, es gratis! Nuestro objetivo es simplificar al máximo el hecho de encontrar nuestro Geoo, y por tanto hemos decidido crear una sencilla aplicación descargable desde los catálogos de aplicaciones de los distintos sistemas operativos móviles.</p>
<p><b>¿Geoo necesita algñun tipo de mantenimiento?</b></p>
<p>Para nada. Geoo funciona perfectamente, sin importar si está sucio o no. Olvida tener que limpiar tu Geoo, simplemente colocalo donde quieras y disfruta encontrando todo aquello que habías perdido.</p>
<p><b>¿Geoo estará disponible en mi país?</b></p>
<p>Seas de donde seas, podrás hacerte con tu Geoo. La distribución será global, por lo que tu país también está incluido.</p>
<p><b>¿Qué dispositivos puedo usar para localizar mi Geoo?</b></p>
<p>Cualquier dispositivo con tecnología Bluetooth es válido para encontrar tu Geoo. Pensamos que sería una gran ventaja utilizar una tecnología que sea familiar para el mayor número de personas posibles y sea fácil de usar. También, cualquier tipo de conexión a Internet permitiría la conexión, reduciendo aún más los requisitios para los usuarios y facilitando su uso.</p>
<p><b>¿Quién puede ver dónde está mi Geoo?</b></p>
<p>Hemos diseñado Geoo de forma que cada uno tenga un código único e irremplazable que sólo el usuario conocerá. Por ello, nadie puede saber el código de identificación de tu Geoo y será totalmente privado. Además, nuestro sistema de seguridad genera los códigos de identificación como combinaciones de 32 bits encriptados, evitando así posibles pirateos.</p>
<p><b>¿Por qué sólo ofrecemos Geoo Home en nuestras recompensas?</b></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">De momento, Geoo Home es nuestro principal objetivo a cumplir. De este modo hemos pensado lanzar primero el modelo básico de los Geoos, y si todo se cumple y va como es esperado, tenemos intención de lanzar nuestro segundo producto, Geoo Pro. Hablando de la versión Pro, hemos incluido algunos códigos de descuento entre algunas de nuestras recompensas, principalmente porque son de gran ayuda para nuestro desarrollo de los productos, y queremos de alguna forma devolver el favor con nuestros inversores.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b>¿Geoo es flexible?</b></p>
<p>Nuestros últimos diseños han demostrado que sería mucho más costoso y complicado de obtener la capacidad flexible en los Geoos. Pensamos que sería de una mayor trascendencia aplicar la resistencia al agua y polvo que la flexiblidad del localizador en sí, y así hemos hecho.</p>
<p><b>¿Mi código de Geoo es único y confidencial?</b></p>
<p>¡Por supuesto! Cada Geoo tiene su propio código de identificación. De esta forma, no puede haber errores de sincronización y el usuario puede sentirse totalmente seguro usando su Geoo.</p>
<p><b>¿Geoo tiene algún coste mensual?</b></p>
<p>No. Geoo ha sido diseñado para operar sin necesidad de pagos adicionales por el servicio, más allá del precio del dispositivo. Hemos tenido constantemente presentes el objetivo de mantener los costes para el cliente los menores posibles.</p>
<p><b>¿Geoo es nuestro único proyecto?</b></p>
<p>Para nada. Durante el desarrollo de Geoo hemos iniciado, planeado e incluso diseñado numerosos proyectos de los que estamos seguros sacaremos a la luz tarde o temprano. Para más información, consulta nuestra web: <a href=""http://www.arkynetech.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.arkynetech.com</a></p>
<p><b>¿Dónde está localizada la empresa?</b></p>
<p>Arkyne Technologies fue fundada y permanece ubicada en Barcelona, España.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Política de Devoluciones:</b></p>
<p>Arkyne Technologies no asume ninguna responsabilidad del envío de las recompensas en caso de no llegar a nuestro objetivo económico; sin embargo, enviaremos el dinero de vuelta a aquellos que lo pidan (en un plazo máximo de 1 mes tras el cierre de esta campaña) y que a su vez compraron una recompensa. Se restará un 9% de las devolución total debido a comisiones de Indiegogo y gastos de gestión. Las devoluciones pueden tardar entre 30 y 40 días en realizarse.</p>

  What is Geoo?
Forget about losing anything. Forget about wasting your valuable time trying to find that one thing you need. Just tag it with Geoo, and you´re ready to go. We present Geoo, the Bluetooth and GPS tracker for all your belongings.Our main objective with Geoo is to provide a fast and precise location of what you most care about, so you don´t have to worry a second about losing it. We offer a wide variety of possibilities, because Geoo is designed to fit everyone and everything. Geoo is very easy to use, adapting itself to everybody´s needs perfectly. Put a Geoo on what you want to keep track of, open the app on your smartphone or other device with internet connection and localize it in a simple map or radar. As easy as it sounds, that’s all you have to do.The options are endless: track your wallet, bag, car or even your pet. Anything you want to keep, just add a Geoo to it.Geoo can be applied to many professional appliances, many of which would cause a great impact due to its low-cost and high efficiency in tracking by GPS. Many companies spend vasts amounts of money only to track down their business, and it is a very useful tool for many different tasks. There are currently two models; Geoo Home, with a 15.000 square meter range, and Geoo Pro, covering your whole country.Our latest goal will be: Geoo Ultimate, with the same characteristics of the Pro version, but with a world-wide range.


   The Initiative
The Arkyne Tech group is presenting a new innovative investment challenge to develop Geoo. These personal geo-localizers are not only small and efficient, they are also flexible stickers and reach all kinds of distances. Using GPS and bluetooth technologies, every geoo device is able to send its precise position directly to your smartphone and sketch it on a real time map and radar.Our development team has been working on the idea during the last 6 months until we finally acomplished the final designs. Right now, Geoo is more than an idea. However, in order to reach the next step of our plan and be able to finish its entire development we need your help.  One of our main goals is to achieve the most affordable and cheapest price in the market while keeping the highest possible quality. This needs a high starting budget to adquire the most efficient manufacturing and distribution processes. That's why we decided to open this crowdfunding campaign, we appreciate all the support we are receiving and we thank every single person who trusted our project.




 How it Works
Geoo uses a simple Bluetooth connection for short distances, and GPS for longer ones. We have optimized the technology taking part in Geoo, so we are sure about providing the best connection as possible with the user. We are launching 2 different models of Geoo, based on your basic needs. Firstly, Geoo Home, thought for a smaller radius of use, such as a house or a store. Geoo Home is built with a Bluetooth based communication system, easily connectable with many compatible devices. Open the app and Geoo Home will show on a radar where it´s located precisely.




But if Geoo Home doesn´t provide the enough range of use you were looking for, worry no more, because we also present Geoo Pro, the advanced version of our first product. With Geoo Pro you can forget about distance barriers, forget about the optimal connection range. We provide coverage for your whole country´s territory. Whether you go on a trip and want to protect your car or luggage, or if you want to make sure your pet or your most vulnerable family members are well protected, Geoo Pro offers more than a wide enough radius for you to be able to track them with your devices. The gps localizer is easily tracked down and displayed on a detailed map so you can be sure that you recover whatever you are looking for.
    Why Geoo?
We think it would be great to always have localized all our valuable items and possesions. However, we tend to lose many things around our house, car, workplace, etc. So, why not place a Geoo on everything you really need in your daily life and easily find it with a simple search? Why would you waste time looking for anything when you could use Geoo and find it in seconds?


Comparing Geoo with our closest competitor in crowdfunding...




 
   Our Hardware
We will be using a battery that will last over 12 months, providing for a more than enough life cycle for your Geoo. Furthermore, our batteries can be recharged if needed by an induction system. The Bluetooth has a very low power consumption rate,  however it is not a condition for it to reduce its effectivity. As well, optimizing performance is key for all the new technology for it to work at its best, without reducing the user experience. We provide an update rate of your location optimized for the product we are selling. Our refresh rate is set to 1 minute for the Home version, and the amazing 0.5s for the Pro edition, more than an enough accurate time interval for you to localize and track down your Geoo, and with it, your belongings.





The working radius of Geoo Home is also revolutionary. The area fully covered by Geoo Home is of 15000m², sufficient for any Home user to find their device. And you might be wondering, what will happen if I leave this area? Very interesting question with a very easy solution. A notification alert will immediately display on your smartphone, warning you about the distance issue. From there on, you can start the localizing process of your Geoo, or maybe use another interesting feature we have implemented. You can use Geoo Home as a map pin which will save for you to find it later on. For example, leave a Geoo Home in your car when you are going to work, save its location in the map, and you will be able to find it later on when you return.



 Geoo Boundaries
Secure your things with Geoo-Boundaries, set a range for your Geoo device. Once reached this distance, a notification will alert you that the Geoo has exceeded its programed limit. It’s not only easy to use but vital for keeping your things saved when you don’t have time to look after them.






   Geoo Fits Anywhere
Geoo is also very compact. Size has been key for this project. We have taken our designs to the limit, allowing enough space for all the components to fit adequately inside, but without forgetting the need for it to be as slim and tight as it could possibly be. This allows the user to hide a Geoo nearly anywhere without using up much space.



 Geoo is Inexpensive

Prize is also one of our advantages against all the other trackers out on sale. All the other devices ask for a monthly cost for the tracking system to fully function, but we don´t. Our users don´t have to pay for more than the device itself. Other companies charge from $15 to as high as $40 every month, multiplying the tracker's cost every year for it to deliver the same service.






 Geoo is secure, and easy to use.

Many are the ways of tracking down a device, but we thought that the easiest and most user-friendly would have to be an app for your smartphone. Find it in your smartphone´s app store and synchronize your Geoo with your phone by inserting its unique ID code. Nothing else is required. You can add several Geoos to the same phone, easily switching from one to another in a very intuitive menu. By default, your Geoos will have stock names. Simply edit them and name them whatever you like, for example keys, bag or wallet. And you are all done and ready to start finding!

“It´s hard to find an easier to use device which works so well.”
“A friend always forgets where he leaves his car keys. Geoo is just the best gift I could possibly get him”

 FAQs



Why Indiegogo? Why crowdfunding?
We are a still growing technology based company, and crowdfunding offers the possibility to almost everyone to be recognized as well as valuing their work and ideas. This way, Indiegogo seems to be the perfect spot for us to show our ideas to the world.
Is Geoo protected in any way?
Of course! We have designed Geoo for it to be as durable as it can possibly be. This way, Geoo is waterproof and dust resistant, to make sure that it will continue functioning correctly even if it gets wet or dirty. Our International Protection Marking is set to IP-65, resisting any type of solid particle and water jets. 
When do we start shipping?
Once our campaigns have ended successfully and reached our set goals, we will start with our mass production phase, and around 2 to 3 months later, we will start delivering all Geoo devices. 
How much is the shipping for the rewards?
Every reward which includes the delivery of Geoo´s have been assigned a certain shipping cost. To fully acknowledge the total cost of each reward, we recommend reading all the information posted about them specifically.
What will be the price for the smartphone app?
 It´s totally free! Our goal is to simplify as much as possible the process of tracking your Geoo, so an easy-to-install app from your phone´s operating system´s store
Does Geoo need a maintenance of some kind?
Geoo is fully functional whether you clean it or not. No taking care is needed on Geoo, just place it wherever you think it is needed, and enjoy the precise tracking system.
Will Geoo be available in my country?
Yes, we plan on maintaining a worldwide shipping system to provide everyone with their own Geoo.
What devices can I use to find my Geoos?
Any device which is Bluetooth compatible is able to track down the Geoo Home. We think it was our best shot at finding a communication channel that most of the users are familiar with and can have an easy access to. As well, Internet based connection can be made with basically any device, narrowing down even more the user´s requirements to fully use the Geoo´s tracking experience. 
Could anyone track my personal Geoo?
Our design is made for each Geoo to have a unique identification code that will only be given to the tracker’s owner. Therefore, nobody will know your Geoo´s ID code and it will be totally confidential. Furthermore, our faultless system is hack-proof by implementing a 32-bit encryption for the code.
Why do we only offer Geoo Home in our perks?
So far, Geoo Home is our big goal to accomplish. This way, we thought about launching the basic model of Geoo first, and if everything continues going as planned, we intend on launching our advanced version of Geoo, the Pro version. Speaking about the Geoo Pro, we have included some discount codes in our reward system for some specific donations, mainly because they will be a great help for our development and feel the need to compensate in some way our trustful investors. 
Will Geoo be flexible?
Our latest designs have proved that it would be much more expensive and harder to obtain a flexibility state in our Geoos. However, we thought that adding the water and dust resistance was prior to flexibility and so we did.
Is my Geoo ID code unique?
Of course it is! Every Geoo device has its own, unique ID code. This way no synchronization issues can occur and you can fell totally safe when using your Geoo, nobody else can track it down.
Does Geoo apply a monthly cost for its use?
No. Geoo has been designed to be used without having to pay anything else rather than the device itself. We consider it was key for the costs to cause the least impact on the user as possible.
Is Geoo our only project?
Certainly not. We have been simultaneously developing Geoo but also starting to think, plan and design many more appealing projects which we will surely end up displaying and explaining. For further information, you can visit our site: www.arkynetech.com

Where is the company located?Arkyne Techonologies was founded and is still located in Barcelona, Spain.



Refunds' Policy:
Arkyne Technologies does not assume any responsibility of the perks' delivery in case we don't reach our economical goal; however, we will send the money back to every person who bought a perk and asks for it to be returned (in a maximum time limit of 1 month after the closing of this campaign) A 9% will be subtracted from the total refund due to Indiegogo's taxes and management expenses. Refunds may delay from 30 to 40 days time.

  ¿Qué es Geoo?


Olvídate de perder nada nunca más. No pierdas tu valioso tiempo intentando buscar aquello que necesitas. Tan solo tienes que pegar Geoo y listo. Presentamos Geoo, el rastreador Bluetooth y GPS para que no vuelvas a perder nada de vista.

Nuestro objetivo principal con Geoo es dar una localización rápida y precisa de aquello que más te importa, para que así no te tengas que preocupar ni un segundo si lo pierdes. Ofrecemos una amplia variedad de posibilidades, ya que Geoo está diseñado para adaptarse a todos y a todo. Te sorprenderás con la facilidad que se utiliza Geoo. Pon un Geoo en lo que quieras tener localizado, abre la app en tu móvil u otro dispositivo que tenga conexión a internet y localízalo sencillamente en un mapa o radar. Es tan fácil como parece, no tienes que hacer nada más.



Las opciones son interminables: rastrea tu cartera, la mochila, el coche o incluso tu mascota. Cualquier cosa que quieras mantener cerca basta con que tenga un Geoo adherido.
Geoo también tiene incontables aplicaciones profesionales, las cuales causarían un gran impacto debido a su bajo coste y su alta precisión en el rastreo GPS. Son muchas las empresas que gastan una importante suma de dinero en tener localizadas sus operaciones, y Geoo es una herramienta muy útil para poder llevar a cabo infinidad de tareas diferentes, su uso es ideal tanto para pequeñas como grandes empresas.


Nuestro próximo objetivo será: Geoo Ultimate, con las mismas características que Geoo Pro, pero con alcance mundial.



  Nuestra iniciativa
El grupo Arkyne Tech presenta un nuevo reto de inversión para desarrollar Geoo. Estos geolocalizadores no son únicamente compactos y eficientes, sino que también son flexibles y funcionales a distancias superiores. Haciendo uso de las tecnologías Bluetooth y GPS, cada dispositivo Geoo puede enviar su posición con precisión directamente a tu smartphone y mostrarlo a tiempo real en un mapa o radar. Nuestro equipo de desarrollo ha estado trabajando en esta idea durante los últimos 6 meses hasta que finalmente hemos conseguido finalizar nuestros diseños. Actualmente, Geoo es más que una idea. Sin embargo, para poder alcanzar nuestra siguiente fase y poder terminar por completo el desarrollo necesitamos de tu ayuda. Uno de nuestros principales objetivos es mantener nuestro precio lo más bajo posible, sin que ellos afecte a un servicio de máxima calidad. Esto necesita de una inversión inicial más elevada, para poder asegurar mayor eficiencia en los procesos de producción y distribución. Por ello hemos elegido abrir esta campaña de crowdfunding, agradecemos todo el apoyo que estamos recibiendo y a todos los que confiaron en nuestro proyecto.








  ¿Cómo funciona?
Geoo usa una conexión Bluetooth para distancias cortas, y GPS para distancias mayores. Hemos optimizado la tecnología desarrollando Geoo, por ello, estamos seguros de que ofrecemos la mejor conexión posible con el usuario. Contamos con dos modelos de Geoo basados en tus necesidades. En primer lugar, Geoo Home, pensado para un rango de uso doméstico o para tu almacén o tienda. Geoo Home tiene incorporado un sistema de conexión Bluetooth, fácilmente enlazable con multitud de dispositivos disponibles. Abre la app y Geoo Home mostrará en un radar su ubicación exacta.


Pero si Geoo Home no te proporciona un radio de uso suficiente, no te preocupes, porque te presentamos Geoo Pro, la versión avanzada de nuestro primer producto. Con Geoo Pro te puedes olvidar de las distancias límite y el radio de conexión óptimo, ya que ofrece cobertura en todo el territorio nacional de tu país. Si te vas de excursión y quieres tener controlado tu coche o equipaje, o si te quieres asegurar de que tu mascota o algún familiar estén localizados, Geoo Pro tiene un radio de uso más que suficiente para que seas capaz de saber dónde se encuentran. El localizador GPS es fácilmente rastreado y se presenta en un mapa detallado para que encuentres lo que buscas con total seguridad.





¿Por qué Geoo?
Sería genial tener siempre localizados todos nuestros objetos importantes y pertenencias personales. Sin embargo, tendemos a perder muchas cosas por casa, en el coche o en el trabajo. Así pues, ¿por qué no ponemos un Geoo a todo lo que utilizamos en nuestro día a día y poder localizarlo con una simple búsqueda? ¿Para qué molestarse en perder tiempo buscando algo cuando podrías encontrarlo con Geoo en unos segundos?



Comparando Geoo con nuestro competidor más próximo en crowdfunding...






Nuestro hardware
La batería que usaremos tiene una duración estimada de más de 12 meses, proporcionando así una vida útil más que suficiente para tu Geoo. Además, nuestras baterías son recargables mediante inducción. La tecnología Bluetooth usada tiene un consumo muy reducido, pero ello no significa que disminuya su efectividad. La optimización del sistema es clave para que todos los nuevos productos tecnológicos funcionen al máximo rendimiento, sin entorpecer la experiencia hacia el usuario. Nosotros proporcionamos una frecuencia de refresco de la ubicación de 1 minuto para el Geoo Home, y de unos increíbles 0.5 segundos para la versión Pro, más que suficiente para que el cliente pueda localizar su Geoo, y con él, sus bienes.



El radio de funcionamiento de Geoo Home es totalmente revolucionario. Geoo Home puede cubrir un área total de 15000 m². Y te puedes estar preguntando, ¿qué ocurre si me alejo de esta zona? Una muy buena pregunta que tiene una muy fácil respuesta. Una notificación alertará inmediatamente al usuario en su smartphone, avisándole de la situación. Desde ahí el usuario decide cómo proceder, si iniciar la búsqueda del Geoo, o quizás hacer uso de una nueva característica implementada en los Geoo. Puedes usar los Geoo Home como marcador en tu mapa que se guardará para que lo puedas encontrar más tarde. Por ejemplo. Deja tu Geoo Home en el coche cuando vayas a trabajar y marca su localización en el mapa, para que cuando vuelvas más tarde al coche, lo tengas localizado en tu mapa personal.




 Geoo Boundaries
Asegura todas tus pertenencias con Geoo-Boundaries fijando un rango para tu dispositivo Geoo. Una vez alcanzada esta distancia, una notificación te avisará de que tu Geoo ha excedido su límite programado. No sólo es fácil de usar, sino que también vital para mantener controladas tus pertenencias cuando no tienes tiempo para buscarlas.




 Geoo se adapta a ti
Geoo tiene un diseño compacto. Hemos llevado al límite nuestros diseños para que todos los componentes pudieran entrar con suficiente espacio para su correcto funcionamiento, pero sin olvidarnos de que pueda ocupar el menor espacio posible y así ocultarse en tu bolso o cartera.







 Geoo es económico
El precio también es uno de nuestros puntos fuertes con respecto a la competencia del sector. Todas las demás compañías ofrecen su servicio mediante pagos mensuales. Sin embargo, nuestros usuario sólo deben preocuparse del precio del Geoo en sí, ya que no hay pago mensual por la conexión. Como ejemplo, algunas marcas cobran desde $15 hasta incluso llegar a los $40 mensuales, multiplicando por tanto el precio real del dispositivo, y por tanto el total al cabo del año por el mismo servicio.




 Geoo es seguro, y fácil de usar
Muchas son las formas de conectarse con el dispositivo para poder localizarlo. Sin embargo, hemos pensado que la forma más cómoda para todos los usuarios es mediante aplicaciones de smartphone. Simplemente busca nuestra aplicación dedicada a Geoo y sincronízalo introduciendo el código identificativo de tu Geoo. Así de sencillo y rápido. También puedes añadir más de un Geoo al mismo terminal, seleccionando entre uno y otro con un intuitivo menú de selección. Para simplificar la selección, modifica el nombre del Geoo que trae por defecto, y llamalo cualquier cosa, por ejemplo, llaves o mochila. ¡Todo listo para empezar a buscar tus Geoos!

 FAQs

¿Por qué Indiegogo? ¿Por qué crowdfunding?
Somos una empresa joven y en crecimiento basados en el diseño y desarrollo de tecnología, y el crowdfunding nos ofrece rápidamente la posibilidad de ser conocidos y que todos puedan valorar nuestro trabajo e ideas. De esta forma, Indiegogo parece el portal de crowdfunding idóneo para mostrar nuestro trabajo al resto del mundo.
¿Con qué protecciones cuenta Geoo?
Hemos diseñado Geoo de forma que sea lo más duradero posible. Para ello, Geoo es resistente al agua y polvo, para asegurarnos de que continue funcionando correctamente aun si se moja o ensucia. Nuestro Grado de Proteccion IP es de IP-65, resistiendo chorros de agua y partículas sólidas de cualquier tipo.
¿Cuándo comenzarán los envíos de Geoo?
Una vez hayan finalizado nuestras campañas con éxito y se hayan cumplido nuestros objetivos, comenzaremos la producción en masa, para poder empezar a enviar los Geoo entre 2 y 3 meses después. 
¿Cuál es el coste de envío en las recompensas?
Cada recompensa que tiene asignada la entrega de un Geoo tiene cierto coste de envío. Para poder conocer al detalle dichos costes, recomendamos consultar la información específica de cada recompensa.
¿Qué precio tendrá la aplicación de Geoo para móvil?
¡Ninguno, es gratis! Nuestro objetivo es simplificar al máximo el hecho de encontrar nuestro Geoo, y por tanto hemos decidido crear una sencilla aplicación descargable desde los catálogos de aplicaciones de los distintos sistemas operativos móviles.
¿Geoo necesita algñun tipo de mantenimiento?
Para nada. Geoo funciona perfectamente, sin importar si está sucio o no. Olvida tener que limpiar tu Geoo, simplemente colocalo donde quieras y disfruta encontrando todo aquello que habías perdido.
¿Geoo estará disponible en mi país?
Seas de donde seas, podrás hacerte con tu Geoo. La distribución será global, por lo que tu país también está incluido.
¿Qué dispositivos puedo usar para localizar mi Geoo?
Cualquier dispositivo con tecnología Bluetooth es válido para encontrar tu Geoo. Pensamos que sería una gran ventaja utilizar una tecnología que sea familiar para el mayor número de personas posibles y sea fácil de usar. También, cualquier tipo de conexión a Internet permitiría la conexión, reduciendo aún más los requisitios para los usuarios y facilitando su uso.
¿Quién puede ver dónde está mi Geoo?
Hemos diseñado Geoo de forma que cada uno tenga un código único e irremplazable que sólo el usuario conocerá. Por ello, nadie puede saber el código de identificación de tu Geoo y será totalmente privado. Además, nuestro sistema de seguridad genera los códigos de identificación como combinaciones de 32 bits encriptados, evitando así posibles pirateos.
¿Por qué sólo ofrecemos Geoo Home en nuestras recompensas?
De momento, Geoo Home es nuestro principal objetivo a cumplir. De este modo hemos pensado lanzar primero el modelo básico de los Geoos, y si todo se cumple y va como es esperado, tenemos intención de lanzar nuestro segundo producto, Geoo Pro. Hablando de la versión Pro, hemos incluido algunos códigos de descuento entre algunas de nuestras recompensas, principalmente porque son de gran ayuda para nuestro desarrollo de los productos, y queremos de alguna forma devolver el favor con nuestros inversores.



¿Geoo es flexible?
Nuestros últimos diseños han demostrado que sería mucho más costoso y complicado de obtener la capacidad flexible en los Geoos. Pensamos que sería de una mayor trascendencia aplicar la resistencia al agua y polvo que la flexiblidad del localizador en sí, y así hemos hecho.
¿Mi código de Geoo es único y confidencial?
¡Por supuesto! Cada Geoo tiene su propio código de identificación. De esta forma, no puede haber errores de sincronización y el usuario puede sentirse totalmente seguro usando su Geoo.
¿Geoo tiene algún coste mensual?
No. Geoo ha sido diseñado para operar sin necesidad de pagos adicionales por el servicio, más allá del precio del dispositivo. Hemos tenido constantemente presentes el objetivo de mantener los costes para el cliente los menores posibles.
¿Geoo es nuestro único proyecto?
Para nada. Durante el desarrollo de Geoo hemos iniciado, planeado e incluso diseñado numerosos proyectos de los que estamos seguros sacaremos a la luz tarde o temprano. Para más información, consulta nuestra web: www.arkynetech.com
¿Dónde está localizada la empresa?
Arkyne Technologies fue fundada y permanece ubicada en Barcelona, España.


Política de Devoluciones:
Arkyne Technologies no asume ninguna responsabilidad del envío de las recompensas en caso de no llegar a nuestro objetivo económico; sin embargo, enviaremos el dinero de vuelta a aquellos que lo pidan (en un plazo máximo de 1 mes tras el cierre de esta campaña) y que a su vez compraron una recompensa. Se restará un 9% de las devolución total debido a comisiones de Indiegogo y gastos de gestión. Las devoluciones pueden tardar entre 30 y 40 días en realizarse.

FOLIO is a modern design product born using new technologies as CNC machineFOLIO is made to make happier yourself or the person you loveFOLIO is a collection of original designs astonishing and always growingFOLIO is designed and made in Italy I am an architect and I work with my friend-colleagues of www.greentales.it , a startup specialized in prototyping that is also an architectural/design/graphic studio, with a fablab inside. When the last purchase arrived, a laser cut machine, I have immediately fallen in love with her new possibilities. I am an earlier fan of model making, I love to draw something bidimensional becoming real objects. I started designing products for Christmas period expressing  myself creatively and creating something to share with friends and family: I wanted something new and funny, making people smile! And so I had idea of FOLIO, a collection of products with fun and fresh design, made with wood. I’ve gotten really great feedback and want to continue to grow!Now Folio becomes my first project in progress and I want to develope it until to see it as a product known all over the world.FOLIO has UNI sizes (A4, A5, B3), recognizable and simply to ship and deliver, and the most important feature is that YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP IT: I think it’s not important your age, this is something will always funny. The material is plywood, cheap and eco-friendly, with a vintage look.Every piece of FOLIO has a unique plate, detachable and usable, with the name, a specific number, and a row to write a name, “made with love for….”. Special features or drawings can be made by order, because FOLIO is customizable.       The FOLIO project is developed in Collections, so to have a range of different products, for younger and older, for funny or decorations, for gifts or enjoyment.The first Collection made is XMAS2014, but I have many more in my head and I want to hurry up and make it all. You can buy one, but you can buy the Collection, or you can buy an album with a mix of those.I have already made these series:

XMAS: 4 amusing gifts for Christmas period


3D PUZZLE: 5 little animals, cute and funny, plus a small Deer trophy and a Heart where to put candies or cares.


KIDS: 3 little family of animals for different environment, for younger supporters


CANDLES: 4 pretty square cases with original designs, where to put your pens, your candles, or what you want 


BIG: 2 animals a the moment, Dog and Chiken, in two version, Normal or Lamp


LAMQ: 3 stunning lamp creating a lovely light atmosphere and wonderful shadows on your walls.

But I have others I have started working with:

You can have more informations and pictures on our web site, please take a look!www.foliolaserfun.comFolio is very simple to build: the pieces are pre-cutted and for the joints you just have to follow the construction numbers or the instructions. For a better work, you need a simple cutter and little bit of glue (vinavil type), but they are not necessary. I will put some simple instructions in the web site, so to make it even easier. For the small one, you just need 5 minutes to make one, for the big one, just a little little more...and I promise it will surprising and amusing time. :) I trust in the quality and the design of my products and I have had already good feedback  from buyers but now I have demand I can‘t support at the moment. The master pieces are ready and I want to work on others, and now I need to improve the production.I use the laser cut machine of the company of my friends, where I worked hard to design the products in the last few months, and now I have to face new charges.I want to develope the project: I need a website with e-commerce, I want to promote it, I want to design special packaging for shops, I would like to obtain safety certification for lamps, I would develope a trade policy, so the products will be available in places as bookshops, design shops, souvenir shops, and I want to show project and products in public faire, as the next Design Week in Milan.I need a little budget to improve our workspace, especially the machine for fumes digestion: the one we have is not working well, so many times I have to work in a smelly fog (uncomfortable and unhealthy).At last, I need a small, cheap, second hand car, because I crashed mine one month ago and I need it to go to laboratory located in industrial zone of my town - It’s all true, and my friends well know it.With your support we can make a lot of people happier: the person you give FOLIO as a gift, your self if you put a FOLIO in your home, and me that I make a dream reality :)It is my first project of e-commerce, but It is a long time I follow and study other similar cases and now there are a lot of tools in Internet to make it easier and productive, as e-commerce platform, crowdfunding platform, website for checking orders and deliveres.I have to improve my experience in shipping worldwide but I am ready to do it, so I will be able to deliver products in six weeks all over the world in a secure and safe packaging.FOLIO models have different design, size, function. You can suggest other creations, ask for other solutions or have special customization: you can write names, phrases or ask for special wishes. You can also have a special gift to give in your special celebration... I will do my best for your satisfaction!

<p>As we expand, we are searching for new markets. The areas we are looking to get into are both equestrian helmets for riders and those with medical needs who need to wear helmets in their daily lives. We found these markets to be interesting and believed Bandbox could provide something that doesn't yet exist. </p>
<p>For medical needs, we found creating attractive hats allows people to feel more comfortable in their daily lives.   <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>As for Equestrian, we have sold numerous helmets to riders looking to change up the style in an industry that has been pretty much the same for a long time.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Always the early adopter, Cheryl Allen-Munley was one of the first purchasers of the Bell bicycle helmet in the late 1970s.  But after viewing one photo of herself cycling through the French countryside sporting a monstrous white plastic mushroom on her head, Cheryl spent the rest of her European tour with the helmet firmly strapped to the rear rack of her bicycle.  For the next 30 years, she refused to wear a helmet until the publication of her doctoral dissertation on urban bicycle route safety in 2003 suddenly transformed her into a bicycle safety expert.  Suddenly, her historic distaste for bicycle helmets became a public issue.  Tired of parrying the frequent jibe of ""How can you of all people not wear a helmet,"" Cheryl determined to attack the problem head on.</span></p>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">Dr. Cheryl Allen-Munley is responsible for product design, helmet-hat production, and marketing.  She has a BS in civil engineering from MIT, a MBA from the Columbia and a PhD in transportation from NJIT.  Dr. Munley’s research on bicycle safety has received commendations from the Federal Highway Authority.  She previously managed the Newark Division of Traffic and Signals.</span>
</div><div>
<p>Dean Munley oversees company finances, helmet production and order fulfillment.   He is a graduate of the NJIT School of Architecture.  During his 30-year career of project development, he has managed multi-million dollar projects from planning, though permitting, design, construction and operations</p>
<p>Antonina Babenko (not pictured), seamstress/milliner, began assisting with production and design of helmet-hats in April 2015. Ms. Babenko received a Master degree as ""Designer of sewing products” and a Bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering from Kiev University of Technology and Design.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>                           Use of funds</h3>
<div>
<p><br/>Since its founding in 2010, Bandbox™ could be characterized as a start-up company. The company has been self-financed.  Company partners have been responsible for all activities from design to manufacturing to sales.  Promotion costs are minimal: limited to social networking, press coverage and local trade shows.  The sales volume ranges between 25-100 units per month.  The company is profitable because the partners contribute their labor at below market rates and the business operates out of their home.</p>
<p>Raising $30,000 on IndieGoGo will enable Bandbox™ to address our most pressing problem: our production capacity’s inability to meet demand.  During the summer of 2015, customers were forced to wait as long as 6 weeks to receive helmet-hats.  Failure to fulfill orders in a timely manner produce a number of negative results including customer complaints, poor ratings on Amazon.com, retail stores reluctance to carry the product, and worst of all, diversion of sales to our competitors.  The following proposed investments will both increase Bandox’s capacity as well as increase sales volumes to convert this increased capacity into revenues. </p>

<p>Current helmet manufacture consists of a time-consuming process whereby foam is hand mixed and molded within the shell.  Outsourcing foam core production would reduce labor costs and increase Bandbox’s production capacity.   New molds for the thermoplastic vacuum formed exterior ABS molds will also be required.  Bandbox™ has enlisted the aid of Conrad Mercurious, the RVCC manufacturing engineering lab director, to conduct modeling and 3D printing. New production methods will require new testing for CPSC certification at the SGS Laboratory.  Helmets will also be tested to meet EU and Australian/New Zealand standards to allow sale of Bandbox™ Helmets in retail store in these countries.  </p>

<p>While exports to the southern hemisphere shelters Bandbox™ from the extreme seasonality of most bicycle and equestrian accessory manufacturers, it is indisputable that sales peak each year in late spring.  Maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet this anticipated has added benefits beyond the obvious need to provide rapid order turnaround.  Firstly, maintaining higher inventory allows for larger supply orders which result in both lower unit costs and lower shipping costs, which can be substantial.  Secondly, producing helmet-hats at a uniform level allows Bandbox™  to rely on trained contract part-time staff working instead of scrambling to meet rush orders requiring tradeoffs between paying premium labor rates pay or relying on untrained staff with the potential for quality irregularities.</p>

<p>Current helmet-hat production consists of the time-consuming process of soaking and hat-blocking hat bodies.  With commercial quality millinery steamers, hat blocks, hat dryers, industrial sewing machines and sergers, helmet-hats could be fabricated more rapidly and with a more consistent quality.  </p>

Bandbox™ helmets fulfill the pressing and poorly met need of utility bicyclists who ride for transportation in addition to recreation and exercise.  In the past decade, concerns for national obesity rates and global warming have spurred bicycle sales to women and their families.  The federal government has encouraged this trend by funding the Safe Walks to School program and other bicycle friendly initiatives. According to the American League of Bicyclists' study, ""Women on a Roll,"" women own 60% of the nation's bicycles and from 2006 to 2012 the number of women bicycle commuters rose 58%.  This shift in purpose has fostered a demand for innovation in bicyclists’ wardrobes.

 New Market
As we expand, we are searching for new markets. The areas we are looking to get into are both equestrian helmets for riders and those with medical needs who need to wear helmets in their daily lives. We found these markets to be interesting and believed Bandbox could provide something that doesn't yet exist. 
For medical needs, we found creating attractive hats allows people to feel more comfortable in their daily lives.   As for Equestrian, we have sold numerous helmets to riders looking to change up the style in an industry that has been pretty much the same for a long time. In a sport where flair is apart of competition, Bandbox is looking to bring that style and flair with custom equestrian helmets. 
 Company History
Always the early adopter, Cheryl Allen-Munley was one of the first purchasers of the Bell bicycle helmet in the late 1970s.  But after viewing one photo of herself cycling through the French countryside sporting a monstrous white plastic mushroom on her head, Cheryl spent the rest of her European tour with the helmet firmly strapped to the rear rack of her bicycle.  For the next 30 years, she refused to wear a helmet until the publication of her doctoral dissertation on urban bicycle route safety in 2003 suddenly transformed her into a bicycle safety expert.  Suddenly, her historic distaste for bicycle helmets became a public issue.  Tired of parrying the frequent jibe of ""How can you of all people not wear a helmet,"" Cheryl determined to attack the problem head on.
Management Team
 
 

Dr. Cheryl Allen-Munley is responsible for product design, helmet-hat production, and marketing.  She has a BS in civil engineering from MIT, a MBA from the Columbia and a PhD in transportation from NJIT.  Dr. Munley’s research on bicycle safety has received commendations from the Federal Highway Authority.  She previously managed the Newark Division of Traffic and Signals.

Dean Munley oversees company finances, helmet production and order fulfillment.   He is a graduate of the NJIT School of Architecture.  During his 30-year career of project development, he has managed multi-million dollar projects from planning, though permitting, design, construction and operations
Antonina Babenko (not pictured), seamstress/milliner, began assisting with production and design of helmet-hats in April 2015. Ms. Babenko received a Master degree as ""Designer of sewing products” and a Bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering from Kiev University of Technology and Design.
 
                           Use of funds

Since its founding in 2010, Bandbox™ could be characterized as a start-up company. The company has been self-financed.  Company partners have been responsible for all activities from design to manufacturing to sales.  Promotion costs are minimal: limited to social networking, press coverage and local trade shows.  The sales volume ranges between 25-100 units per month.  The company is profitable because the partners contribute their labor at below market rates and the business operates out of their home.
Raising $30,000 on IndieGoGo will enable Bandbox™ to address our most pressing problem: our production capacity’s inability to meet demand.  During the summer of 2015, customers were forced to wait as long as 6 weeks to receive helmet-hats.  Failure to fulfill orders in a timely manner produce a number of negative results including customer complaints, poor ratings on Amazon.com, retail stores reluctance to carry the product, and worst of all, diversion of sales to our competitors.  The following proposed investments will both increase Bandox’s capacity as well as increase sales volumes to convert this increased capacity into revenues. 
                                  
 
 
                                          
Current helmet manufacture consists of a time-consuming process whereby foam is hand mixed and molded within the shell.  Outsourcing foam core production would reduce labor costs and increase Bandbox’s production capacity.   New molds for the thermoplastic vacuum formed exterior ABS molds will also be required.  Bandbox™ has enlisted the aid of Conrad Mercurious, the RVCC manufacturing engineering lab director, to conduct modeling and 3D printing. New production methods will require new testing for CPSC certification at the SGS Laboratory.  Helmets will also be tested to meet EU and Australian/New Zealand standards to allow sale of Bandbox™ Helmets in retail store in these countries.  
 

 
                                     
While exports to the southern hemisphere shelters Bandbox™ from the extreme seasonality of most bicycle and equestrian accessory manufacturers, it is indisputable that sales peak each year in late spring.  Maintaining sufficient levels of inventory to meet this anticipated has added benefits beyond the obvious need to provide rapid order turnaround.  Firstly, maintaining higher inventory allows for larger supply orders which result in both lower unit costs and lower shipping costs, which can be substantial.  Secondly, producing helmet-hats at a uniform level allows Bandbox™  to rely on trained contract part-time staff working instead of scrambling to meet rush orders requiring tradeoffs between paying premium labor rates pay or relying on untrained staff with the potential for quality irregularities.
 
                                 
Current helmet-hat production consists of the time-consuming process of soaking and hat-blocking hat bodies.  With commercial quality millinery steamers, hat blocks, hat dryers, industrial sewing machines and sergers, helmet-hats could be fabricated more rapidly and with a more consistent quality.  
 
  
                                      Online retail sales result in much higher margins than wholesale sales to stores.  The Bandboxllc.com website hosted by Register.com was created using a standard template.  The company catalog was created using a MSWord template with photography done primarily by the in-house.  A professionally built website and catalog with professional photography and text would certainly increase Internet sales.  Ideally, customers would be able to upload pictures of themselves, then superimpose images of the helmets in varying styles and colors to assist in making their selection.  In addition, videos are needed for instruction: how to fit the helmet, how to change the helmet-hats, etc. Bandbox™ is currently soliciting bids through Freelancer.com.
 
                                                                  Bandbox™ sales are packaged in white, rectangular hat boxes with computer printer adhesive labels.  These generic boxes are not sufficiently sturdy to withstand rough handling during shipping.  Distinctive, mail-able packaging would reinforce the company’s trademark.  Bids have been received from overseas box manufactures requiring minimum purchases of 500-1,000 units.    A unified printing program is needed for company brochure, business cards, and other labels.  Point of sale hang tags with SPC codes must be obtained for individual products.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>======</p>
<p>We intend to begin the journey in 2017, at the time of Maya’s birth day, which is </p>
<p>16 th of March 04:55 am.</p>
<p><b>Route of the journey*</b></p>

<p><i>(Depending on the flow of life, we may visit more different places than the original plan)</i></p>
<p><i><b>More about earth chakra chantings;</b></i></p>
<p><i>Some of those places are small chakras – vortices and some of them are the main chakras of the Earth. Being and meditating in those energy fields have known affects of increasing the consciousness vibration and purifying the emotional heaviness of the people. Our intention is to channel those unique frequencies in to sounds by chanting, accompanied by a rattle, drum or singing bowls, which we will record and share for bringing those affects to people who will listen and meditate.</i></p>
<p><i>Till now we have made sound healing to many people, many groups,  and builded up the deeper understanding and gained the  level of experience which was necessary for this mission. It feels like we have been preparing ourselves for this journey all life long.</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have calculated that 25,000 Usd will be enough to make this journey happen.</p>

<p>~~Kitlesel fonlama ile <i>‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’</i> için gerekli maddi kaynağın, bütüne hayrı dokunacağına inanan insanlar tarafından toplanması.~~</p>
<p>Mucizeye yolculuk, 4 yaşındaki kızlarıyla, 3 kıtada, 6 ay sürecek bir yolculuğa çıkmaya niyet eden şifacı bir ruh eşi çiftin öyküsüdür.</p>
<p>Biz Yuuka, Strong Wings Gökhan ve Maya. Hayattaki motivasyonumuz ve amacımız insanlara içlerinde uyumakta olan sevgiyi, gücü ve özgürlüğü uyandırmaları konusunda ilham olmak. Bu ilhamı yalnızca olduğumuz gibi yaşayarak sunuyoruz. Kalpten yaşıyoruz; yani kalpten – Ruh’dan - Yaratan’dan gelen arzuyu takip edip onurlandırarak yaşıyoruz.</p>
<p>‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’ ismini taktığımız bu hayal (proje) böylesine bir arzu.</p>
<p>Bu hayale dair bir şey daha var…</p>
<p>Biz ‘Ses ile Şifa’ yöntemiyle çalışan ve enerjileri sese dönüştürebilen şifacı bir çiftiz.</p>
<p>Mucizeye Yolculuk’un rotası yeryüzü çakraları olarak bilinen yüksek frekanslı enerji merkezlerinden geçecek. Amacımız her bir yeryüzü çakrası geçişimizde, o yere has, arındıran, şifalandıran, bilinç yükselten enerjileri, şamanik-evrensel yöntemlerle sese dönüştürmek ve kaydedeceğimiz ses dosyalarını blog sayfamızdan yayınlamak. Böylece binlerce km ötedeki enerji alanlarının frekanslarını, ihtiyaç duyanların kulağına-varlığına ulaştırmış olacağız.</p>
<p><b>Özetle yolculuğun amaç ve hedefleri:</b></p>
<p><b>+</b> İlham olmak ve bütüne hizmet etmek</p>
<p><b>+</b> Yolculuğun başlayacağı gün 4. Yaş gününü kutlayacağımız kızımız Maya’ya unutulmaz bir hediye olarak varlığın gücü, öz sevgi ve Yaratan'ın birliğini hissettirecek bir yolculuk deneyimi sunmak.</p>
<p><b>+</b> Seyahat etmek, dünya güzelliklerini görmek, yeni insanlarla tanışmak, yeryüzü çakralarının enerjilerini deneyimlemek ve ruhani hatırlamalar yaşamak.</p>
<p><b>+</b> 3 kıtada 6 ay sürecek yolculuk boyunca, yer yüzü çakralarında şaman davulu, Tibet çanakları ve insan sesini, şifa aktarmak niyetiyle seslendirerek, kayıtları blog sayfamızdan paylaşmak.</p>
<p><b>+</b> O yerlerin kendine has enerjilerini görseller ve yazılar ile blog sayfamızda paylaşmak.</p>
<p><b>+</b> Akıştaki hayatımızın öyküsünü bu yolculuk esnasında ve sonrasında kaleme alarak kitaplaştırmak.</p>
<p><b>+</b> Yolculuk dönüşünde, ‘Yeryüzü Çakraları ile Meditasyon’ adlı bir müzik albümünü uyanışa hizmet etmek niyetiyle çıkartmak.</p>
<p><b>+</b>Yolculuk boyunca edineceğimiz deneyimler ile içsel yolculuğumuzda derinlik kazanmak.</p>
<p>============  </p>
<p>Niyetimiz yolculuğa Maya’nın doğum günü olan 16 Mart 04:55 ‘ de (2017) başlamak.</p>
<p><b>Rotamız:</b></p>
<p>Türkiye – Göbeklitepe (Dünyanın ilk tapınağı)</p>
<p>Bosna Piramitleri</p>
<p>K. Amerika, Shasta Dağı</p>
<p>K. Amerika, Arizona – Sedona</p>
<p>K. Amerika, Mexico, Güneş Piramiti ve diğer Maya Tapınakları</p>
<p>G. Amerika, Peru, Titicaca Gölü ve Machu Picchu</p>
<p>G. Amerika, Bolivya, Titicaca gölü</p>
<p>Japonya, Fuji dağı zirvesi</p>
<p><i>(Yolculuğun akışına teslim olduğumuzda aklımızı ve yolumuzu esnek tutarak eksik ya da fazla başka mekanlara gitmemiz kuvvetle muhtemel.)</i></p>
<p><i>=========</i></p>
<p>Yeryüzü çakraları hakkında daha fazla bilgi:</p>
<p>Ziyaret edeceğimiz alanların kimileri küçük çakra denilen enerji girdap (vortice) alanları, kimileri ise ana çakralar denilen daha yüksek frekanstaki alanlar.</p>
<p>(İnsan bedeninde yedisi ana çakra olmak üzere toplam ~72,000 den fazla çakra var. Aynı durum Dünya içinde geçerli)</p>
<p>Bir dünya çakrasının içinde-üstünde bulunmanın ve orada meditasyon yapmanın insan bilincinin frekansını yükselten, duygu ağırlıklarını serbest bırakan, ruhani ve fiziksel olarak şifalandıran etkileri olduğu bilinmekte.</p>
<p>Niyetimiz bu çakraların enerjilerini ve olumlu etkilerini ses frekanslarına yükleyerek insanlara ulaştırmak.</p>
<p>Şu ana dek pek çok kimse ve guruplara ses ile şifa aktardık. Bu misyonu yerine getirebilmemiz için gerekli anlayış ve deneyimi edindik. Sanki bütün hayatımız boyunca kendimizi bu yolculuğa hazırlamışız gibi hissediyoruz.</p>
<p>=============</p>
<p>Gerekli Visalar, donanım, uçak biletleri, konaklama, yeme-içme düşünüldüğünde 70,000 Tl, yaklaşık 25,000 dolara ihtiyacımız olduğunu anladık.</p>
<p>Güzel haber, biz bu paranın bir kısmını biriktirdik.</p>
<p>Bu yolculuğun gerçekleşmesinde toplanması yeterli olacak olan miktar 42,000 Tl (15,000 USD)</p>
<p> “<i>‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’ bir Arzu Çiçeğidir.</i></p>
<p><i>Biz onun tohumunu, bir yeni ay gecesi evrenin kalbine ektik.</i></p>
<p><i>Edeceğiniz dua ve yapacağınız bağış ile bu çiçeğin güneş ışığı ve yağmur suyu olur musunuz?</i></p>
<p><i> Çiçeğin büyümesinde ve açmasında katkınız olsun ister misiniz?”</i></p>
<p><i>Desteğiniz için hepinize ayrı ayrı şükranlarımızı sunarız.</i></p>
<p><b>Bütünün en yüksek hayrına olsun.</b></p>
<p><b>Ve öyle olsun…</b></p>
<p><b>Ve Öyle oldu…</b></p>
<p><b>Şükürler Olsun</b></p>
<p><i>(Şayet bu proje için gerekenden daha fazla miktarda para toplanacak olursa, onu da bir sonraki projemiz için kullanacağız: ‘Doğa içinde, yeşil bir alan edinmek, içine bir doğal ev ve birkaç Ti Pi (Amerikan yerli çadırı) kurmak; gönüllülerin organik çiftçiliğe yardımcı olacağı, gönüllülerin mutfağa ve diğer alanlara yardımcı olacağı; ruhani arayıştaki insanları bir araya getirecek; öz bilginin paylaşılacağı, şifanın akacağı ve bağış usulüyle işleyecek ütopik bir yaşam alanı oluşturmak. Ama bu hayat kitabının daha ilerleyen bir bölümü..)</i></p>

<b>ミラクルな旅</b><br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<b></b><p>＂ミラクルな旅"" へのクロウドフンディングは、この旅が、多くの人を、インスパイアし、より良きものへのサービスになるなと信じてくれた人たちのものです。</p>
<p>（もし、他の言語に、通訳をしても良いなと感じる方がいましたら、サポートをお願いします。ありがとうございます。）</p>
<p>これは、ソウルメイトカップルと4歳になる娘を連れて、４大陸を6ヶ月という長い旅をしてみようというお話です。</p>
<p>私たちは、ゆうか、ギョカン、まやです。</p>
<p>お母さん。お父さんと娘です。</p>
<p>私たちの、モチベーションは常に、どうしたら人は愛に目覚めてくれるのか、どうしたらそのようにインスパイアしていけるのか？です。</p>
<p>どうしたら、人びとに、彼ら自身の力や自由を取り戻してあげられるんだろう。ということにあります。</p>
<p>それは、</p>
<p>私たちがまずは、まっすぐに、生きることなんじゃないか。</p>
<p>ハートに従って生きることなんじゃないか。</p>
<p>私たちが、聖なるスピリット、神の声にハートから従うことなんじゃないか。ということなのではないか。</p>
<p>そこから本質的なことができるのではないかと思います。</p>
<p>＂ミラクルな旅”は、そういう旅なのではないかと感じています。</p>
<p>もっと言っておきたいことがあります。</p>
<p>私たちは、スピリチュルなヒーリングをしています。そして、スピリチュルな世界を音に変容させるサウンドヒーリングをしています。</p>
<p>私たちの旅は、アースチャクラを通ります。</p>
<p>（地球上で、高い振動数のエネルギーの場所）</p>
<p>私たちは、アースチャクラごとの、ユニークな振動数を音に変換して、後でサウンドファイルにして皆さんが聞けたり、ダウンロードできるようにしたいと思います。</p>
<p>このサウンドファイルで、皆さん瞑想などをして、浄化や、ヒーリングの効果が得られると思います。</p>
<p>私たちがやろうとしていること。</p>
<p>☆私たちの娘が4歳になるので、忘れられないプレゼントになるだろうということ。</p>
<p>☆地球の美しい場所は、新しい人に会うことで、自分達の深い記憶が蘇りよりよく、自分達としての役割を果たせるのではないかと感じていること。</p>
<p>☆地球のアースチャクラを訪れそこで、私たちのシャーマンドラムやチベタンシンギングボール、そして声のチャンティングをして皆さんがフリーで瞑想ができるようブログにアップしていくこと。</p>
<p>☆アースチャクラでの経験をブログで写真や、日記などで紹介していくこと。</p>
<p>☆私たちの体験や日記を一冊の本にまとめて出版するもしくは何かの形で発表すること。</p>
<p>☆この旅でのアースチャクラのレコーディングをひとつのCDにまとめて、CDアルバムを作ること。</p>
<p>私たちの旅の経験からより深い私たちの自己と繋がれると信じています。</p>
<p>…………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>""ミラクルな旅""は夢の花です。</p>
<p>私たちは、新月の日に、宇宙のハートにこの種を蒔きます。</p>
<p>あなたは、この夢に、水や太陽の光を与えてくれますか。</p>
<p>フンディングや祈りなどを通して、、</p>
<p>……………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>私たちは、２０１７年の３月１６日 ＡＭ ４:５５分からこの旅を始めようと思っています。</p>
<p>娘のまやの誕生日なのです。</p>
<p>★旅の予定★</p>
<p>トルコ     ギョベキ テペ （ 世界で初めての寺院）</p>
<p>ボスニア ピラミッド</p>
<p>アメリカ   シャスタ山</p>
<p>アメリカ   アリゾナ  セドナ</p>
<p>メキシコ    太陽のピラミッド  マヤの神殿</p>
<p>ペルー   チチカカ湖   マチュピチュ</p>
<p>ボリビア    チチカカ湖</p>
<p>日本            富士山</p>
<p>（この旅は、フローしていますので、状況により新しい場所に寄ったりしていく予定です。）</p>
<p>……………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>アースチャクラチャンティングについて。</p>
<p>旅の予定で訪れる場所は、いくつかは、地球上の小さなチャクラ、もしくは、メインチャクラと言われています。</p>
<p>その場所での瞑想は、人びとの意識や感情を浄化し向上させます。</p>
<p>私たちは、その場所のユニークな振動数と繋がり、ラトルやシャーマンドラム、チベタンシンギングボール、声のチャンティングなどを通して、皆さんが聞いて瞑想などができるようシェアしていきます。</p>
<p>今まで、私たちはサウンドヒーリングを多くの人たくさんのグループにやってきました。</p>
<p>そして、深い意識に貯蓄されたものを明らかにしたり、ミッションのための必要な経験を与えたりしてきました。</p>
<p>この経験は、私たち自身が、この次の段階へいく準備だったのかなと感じています。</p>
<p>私たちはこの旅で ２５０００USドル必要なのですが、私たちはすでに、今までの活動で１００００USドルは持っています。</p>
<p>あと、必要なのは、１５０００USドルです。</p>
<p>もしもですが、</p>
<p>お金がより多く集められたら、私たちには、次の夢もあります。大きな緑に囲まれた土地を、買って、ティピを建てて、創造的なことをしたり、休んだり、オーガニックな野菜を作ったり、ボランティアをしてくれる人や、ヨガや瞑想をしたり、ヒーリングをしたり、受けたり、イベントをしたり、バックパッカーの人が落ち合うような場所にしたり、スピリチュアリティに探求しているような人が来てくれたり、、</p>
<p>しかし、これは次の私たちの夢です。</p>
<p>今</p>
<p>私たちは、私たちの夢を叶えてくれようとしているひとりひとりに感謝しています。なぜならば、あなたの祈りが真実であると感じるからです。</p>
<p>あなたに、神のご加護がありますように。</p>

Mother, father and daughter... Our motivation in life is to inspire people to awaken the love, power and freedom that they possess in themselves. For that, we just live.We live from heart and go with the flow by following the dreams of heart-spirit-God.Journey to Miracle is one such dream.
          There is one more thing to it... 
We are spiritual healers, performing sound healing,- translating energy into sound-. 
Our route will pass through Earth Chakras (High frequency energy centers). 
 We will  translate the unique frequencies of the earth chakras in to sounds by playing some instruments and chanting, which later we will upload on our blog page as sound files for people to listen and meditate with them in order to receive the purifying and healing affects.
As a summary, we aim...
+To inspire...
+To give an unforgetable birthday present to our 4 yrs old daughter, 
+To travel, to see beauties of the Earth, to meet new people, to experience Earth Chakra vibratitions and to have spiritual rememberings.
+In 3 Continents, 6 months long, visiting the Earth chakras and vortices; uploading their unique energies onto sound frequencies by playing shaman drums, Tibetian singing bowls and chanting; sharing those sound records on our blogger freely with people, so anyone can meditate with those special vibrations.
+To share our Earth Chakra experiences by blog writing and photography.
+To write the story of our life flow trough and after the journey to create an inspirational book.
+To create an ‘Earth Chakra meditation’ music album with our recordings, upon the end of journey.
+ To find and become more of our true self by the help of experiences we will get from the journey.

======
We intend to begin the journey in 2017, at the time of Maya’s birth day, which is 
16 th of March 04:55 am.
Route of the journey*
Turkey-Gobeklitepe (First temple of the world)
Bosnian Pyramids
Usa- Mt. Shasta
Usa- Arizona-Sedona
Mexico – Pyramid of the Sun and other Mayan Temples
Peru- Lake Titicaca – Machu Picchu
Bolivia – Lake Titicaca
Japan- Mt. Fuji summit
(Depending on the flow of life, we may visit more different places than the original plan)
More about earth chakra chantings;
Some of those places are small chakras – vortices and some of them are the main chakras of the Earth. Being and meditating in those energy fields have known affects of increasing the consciousness vibration and purifying the emotional heaviness of the people. Our intention is to channel those unique frequencies in to sounds by chanting, accompanied by a rattle, drum or singing bowls, which we will record and share for bringing those affects to people who will listen and meditate.
Till now we have made sound healing to many people, many groups,  and builded up the deeper understanding and gained the  level of experience which was necessary for this mission. It feels like we have been preparing ourselves for this journey all life long.

We have calculated that 25,000 Usd will be enough to make this journey happen.

Good news is that, we have allready collected some of this amount by our savings.
What we need is 15,000 Usd to make it happen.

""Journey to Miracle"" is a flower.
We planted it's seed at a new moon night, in to heart of the universe
Would you be the water and sunlight for the growth of it, by your funding and/or your prayer?
If more money  than we need for the journey is collected, it will be used for another of our future project, which is about buying a green land, building few Ti Pi tents in it for creating a retreat and rest center where people can volanteer work at organic farming, receive healing session, do  yoga and meditation etc. A meeting point of backpackers and spiritual seekers... But this is the next chapter...
NOW, 

We are thankful to each one of you for helping our dream become true by funding and/or your prayers.

We know that all your support will be coming from your unconditional love, without expecting anything in return.However as a tradition of Crowdfunding, we would like to present you a small gift of our appreciation. 
For all amount of donations: We will pray for your well being and ascension of your soul.
50 Usd: 1 Oracle card reading to bring the message of your  spirit - higher self to you. The message that you need to hear that time.
250 Usd: We will find and post to your home a power stone that we will find for you in one of those Earth Chakra-vortices.
500 Usd: We will find 3 power stones from 3 different Earth Chakras for you. We will post them to your home at a convenient time during the journey.^^^
Down, you may listen our sound healing chanting which we recently made in a bamboo forest in Japan.
(Please listen Hd, with head phones)
God Bless you.

                                                  Mucizeye Yolculuk
~~Kitlesel fonlama ile ‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’ için gerekli maddi kaynağın, bütüne hayrı dokunacağına inanan insanlar tarafından toplanması.~~
Mucizeye yolculuk, 4 yaşındaki kızlarıyla, 3 kıtada, 6 ay sürecek bir yolculuğa çıkmaya niyet eden şifacı bir ruh eşi çiftin öyküsüdür.
Biz Yuuka, Strong Wings Gökhan ve Maya. Hayattaki motivasyonumuz ve amacımız insanlara içlerinde uyumakta olan sevgiyi, gücü ve özgürlüğü uyandırmaları konusunda ilham olmak. Bu ilhamı yalnızca olduğumuz gibi yaşayarak sunuyoruz. Kalpten yaşıyoruz; yani kalpten – Ruh’dan - Yaratan’dan gelen arzuyu takip edip onurlandırarak yaşıyoruz.
‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’ ismini taktığımız bu hayal (proje) böylesine bir arzu.
Bu hayale dair bir şey daha var…
Biz ‘Ses ile Şifa’ yöntemiyle çalışan ve enerjileri sese dönüştürebilen şifacı bir çiftiz.
Mucizeye Yolculuk’un rotası yeryüzü çakraları olarak bilinen yüksek frekanslı enerji merkezlerinden geçecek. Amacımız her bir yeryüzü çakrası geçişimizde, o yere has, arındıran, şifalandıran, bilinç yükselten enerjileri, şamanik-evrensel yöntemlerle sese dönüştürmek ve kaydedeceğimiz ses dosyalarını blog sayfamızdan yayınlamak. Böylece binlerce km ötedeki enerji alanlarının frekanslarını, ihtiyaç duyanların kulağına-varlığına ulaştırmış olacağız.
Özetle yolculuğun amaç ve hedefleri:
+ İlham olmak ve bütüne hizmet etmek
+ Yolculuğun başlayacağı gün 4. Yaş gününü kutlayacağımız kızımız Maya’ya unutulmaz bir hediye olarak varlığın gücü, öz sevgi ve Yaratan'ın birliğini hissettirecek bir yolculuk deneyimi sunmak.
+ Seyahat etmek, dünya güzelliklerini görmek, yeni insanlarla tanışmak, yeryüzü çakralarının enerjilerini deneyimlemek ve ruhani hatırlamalar yaşamak.
+ 3 kıtada 6 ay sürecek yolculuk boyunca, yer yüzü çakralarında şaman davulu, Tibet çanakları ve insan sesini, şifa aktarmak niyetiyle seslendirerek, kayıtları blog sayfamızdan paylaşmak.
+ O yerlerin kendine has enerjilerini görseller ve yazılar ile blog sayfamızda paylaşmak.
+ Akıştaki hayatımızın öyküsünü bu yolculuk esnasında ve sonrasında kaleme alarak kitaplaştırmak.
+ Yolculuk dönüşünde, ‘Yeryüzü Çakraları ile Meditasyon’ adlı bir müzik albümünü uyanışa hizmet etmek niyetiyle çıkartmak.
+Yolculuk boyunca edineceğimiz deneyimler ile içsel yolculuğumuzda derinlik kazanmak.
============  
Niyetimiz yolculuğa Maya’nın doğum günü olan 16 Mart 04:55 ‘ de (2017) başlamak.
Rotamız:
Türkiye – Göbeklitepe (Dünyanın ilk tapınağı)
Bosna Piramitleri
K. Amerika, Shasta Dağı
K. Amerika, Arizona – Sedona
K. Amerika, Mexico, Güneş Piramiti ve diğer Maya Tapınakları
G. Amerika, Peru, Titicaca Gölü ve Machu Picchu
G. Amerika, Bolivya, Titicaca gölü
Japonya, Fuji dağı zirvesi
(Yolculuğun akışına teslim olduğumuzda aklımızı ve yolumuzu esnek tutarak eksik ya da fazla başka mekanlara gitmemiz kuvvetle muhtemel.)
=========
Yeryüzü çakraları hakkında daha fazla bilgi:
Ziyaret edeceğimiz alanların kimileri küçük çakra denilen enerji girdap (vortice) alanları, kimileri ise ana çakralar denilen daha yüksek frekanstaki alanlar.
(İnsan bedeninde yedisi ana çakra olmak üzere toplam ~72,000 den fazla çakra var. Aynı durum Dünya içinde geçerli)
Bir dünya çakrasının içinde-üstünde bulunmanın ve orada meditasyon yapmanın insan bilincinin frekansını yükselten, duygu ağırlıklarını serbest bırakan, ruhani ve fiziksel olarak şifalandıran etkileri olduğu bilinmekte.
Niyetimiz bu çakraların enerjilerini ve olumlu etkilerini ses frekanslarına yükleyerek insanlara ulaştırmak.
Şu ana dek pek çok kimse ve guruplara ses ile şifa aktardık. Bu misyonu yerine getirebilmemiz için gerekli anlayış ve deneyimi edindik. Sanki bütün hayatımız boyunca kendimizi bu yolculuğa hazırlamışız gibi hissediyoruz.
=============
Gerekli Visalar, donanım, uçak biletleri, konaklama, yeme-içme düşünüldüğünde 70,000 Tl, yaklaşık 25,000 dolara ihtiyacımız olduğunu anladık.
Güzel haber, biz bu paranın bir kısmını biriktirdik.
Bu yolculuğun gerçekleşmesinde toplanması yeterli olacak olan miktar 42,000 Tl (15,000 USD)
 “‘Mucizeye Yolculuk’ bir Arzu Çiçeğidir.
Biz onun tohumunu, bir yeni ay gecesi evrenin kalbine ektik.
Edeceğiniz dua ve yapacağınız bağış ile bu çiçeğin güneş ışığı ve yağmur suyu olur musunuz?
 Çiçeğin büyümesinde ve açmasında katkınız olsun ister misiniz?”
Desteğiniz için hepinize ayrı ayrı şükranlarımızı sunarız.
Bütünün en yüksek hayrına olsun.
Ve öyle olsun…
Ve Öyle oldu…
Şükürler Olsun
(Şayet bu proje için gerekenden daha fazla miktarda para toplanacak olursa, onu da bir sonraki projemiz için kullanacağız: ‘Doğa içinde, yeşil bir alan edinmek, içine bir doğal ev ve birkaç Ti Pi (Amerikan yerli çadırı) kurmak; gönüllülerin organik çiftçiliğe yardımcı olacağı, gönüllülerin mutfağa ve diğer alanlara yardımcı olacağı; ruhani arayıştaki insanları bir araya getirecek; öz bilginin paylaşılacağı, şifanın akacağı ve bağış usulüyle işleyecek ütopik bir yaşam alanı oluşturmak. Ama bu hayat kitabının daha ilerleyen bir bölümü..)

ミラクルな旅

＂ミラクルな旅"" へのクロウドフンディングは、この旅が、多くの人を、インスパイアし、より良きものへのサービスになるなと信じてくれた人たちのものです。
（もし、他の言語に、通訳をしても良いなと感じる方がいましたら、サポートをお願いします。ありがとうございます。）
これは、ソウルメイトカップルと4歳になる娘を連れて、４大陸を6ヶ月という長い旅をしてみようというお話です。
私たちは、ゆうか、ギョカン、まやです。
お母さん。お父さんと娘です。
私たちの、モチベーションは常に、どうしたら人は愛に目覚めてくれるのか、どうしたらそのようにインスパイアしていけるのか？です。
どうしたら、人びとに、彼ら自身の力や自由を取り戻してあげられるんだろう。ということにあります。
それは、
私たちがまずは、まっすぐに、生きることなんじゃないか。
ハートに従って生きることなんじゃないか。
私たちが、聖なるスピリット、神の声にハートから従うことなんじゃないか。ということなのではないか。
そこから本質的なことができるのではないかと思います。
＂ミラクルな旅”は、そういう旅なのではないかと感じています。
もっと言っておきたいことがあります。
私たちは、スピリチュルなヒーリングをしています。そして、スピリチュルな世界を音に変容させるサウンドヒーリングをしています。
私たちの旅は、アースチャクラを通ります。
（地球上で、高い振動数のエネルギーの場所）
私たちは、アースチャクラごとの、ユニークな振動数を音に変換して、後でサウンドファイルにして皆さんが聞けたり、ダウンロードできるようにしたいと思います。
このサウンドファイルで、皆さん瞑想などをして、浄化や、ヒーリングの効果が得られると思います。
私たちがやろうとしていること。
☆私たちの娘が4歳になるので、忘れられないプレゼントになるだろうということ。
☆地球の美しい場所は、新しい人に会うことで、自分達の深い記憶が蘇りよりよく、自分達としての役割を果たせるのではないかと感じていること。
☆地球のアースチャクラを訪れそこで、私たちのシャーマンドラムやチベタンシンギングボール、そして声のチャンティングをして皆さんがフリーで瞑想ができるようブログにアップしていくこと。
☆アースチャクラでの経験をブログで写真や、日記などで紹介していくこと。
☆私たちの体験や日記を一冊の本にまとめて出版するもしくは何かの形で発表すること。
☆この旅でのアースチャクラのレコーディングをひとつのCDにまとめて、CDアルバムを作ること。
私たちの旅の経験からより深い私たちの自己と繋がれると信じています。
…………………………………………………………………
""ミラクルな旅""は夢の花です。
私たちは、新月の日に、宇宙のハートにこの種を蒔きます。
あなたは、この夢に、水や太陽の光を与えてくれますか。
フンディングや祈りなどを通して、、
……………………………………………………………………
私たちは、２０１７年の３月１６日 ＡＭ ４:５５分からこの旅を始めようと思っています。
娘のまやの誕生日なのです。
★旅の予定★
トルコ     ギョベキ テペ （ 世界で初めての寺院）
ボスニア ピラミッド
アメリカ   シャスタ山
アメリカ   アリゾナ  セドナ
メキシコ    太陽のピラミッド  マヤの神殿
ペルー   チチカカ湖   マチュピチュ
ボリビア    チチカカ湖
日本            富士山
（この旅は、フローしていますので、状況により新しい場所に寄ったりしていく予定です。）
……………………………………………………………………
アースチャクラチャンティングについて。
旅の予定で訪れる場所は、いくつかは、地球上の小さなチャクラ、もしくは、メインチャクラと言われています。
その場所での瞑想は、人びとの意識や感情を浄化し向上させます。
私たちは、その場所のユニークな振動数と繋がり、ラトルやシャーマンドラム、チベタンシンギングボール、声のチャンティングなどを通して、皆さんが聞いて瞑想などができるようシェアしていきます。
今まで、私たちはサウンドヒーリングを多くの人たくさんのグループにやってきました。
そして、深い意識に貯蓄されたものを明らかにしたり、ミッションのための必要な経験を与えたりしてきました。
この経験は、私たち自身が、この次の段階へいく準備だったのかなと感じています。
私たちはこの旅で ２５０００USドル必要なのですが、私たちはすでに、今までの活動で１００００USドルは持っています。
あと、必要なのは、１５０００USドルです。
もしもですが、
お金がより多く集められたら、私たちには、次の夢もあります。大きな緑に囲まれた土地を、買って、ティピを建てて、創造的なことをしたり、休んだり、オーガニックな野菜を作ったり、ボランティアをしてくれる人や、ヨガや瞑想をしたり、ヒーリングをしたり、受けたり、イベントをしたり、バックパッカーの人が落ち合うような場所にしたり、スピリチュアリティに探求しているような人が来てくれたり、、
しかし、これは次の私たちの夢です。
今
私たちは、私たちの夢を叶えてくれようとしているひとりひとりに感謝しています。なぜならば、あなたの祈りが真実であると感じるからです。
あなたに、神のご加護がありますように。

THANK YOU FOR VISITING OUR CAMPAIGN

 

 

OUR STORY
 
 
We are family company. Our goal is to create portable, multifunctional, easy to use and practical outdoor device.

 
Many of us thought that it is impossible to invent something new in outdoor food preparation.

<i><br/></i><h2><b>Our Story and
our challenge</b></h2>
<p>When we built
our first longboard a couple of years ago back in 2009, we didn’t really plan
to actually do it in exchange for money. Nonetheless we continuously kept on
developing our longboards with a lot of passion and ambition, because that’s
what we love. The awareness and demand from our friends, friends of friends and
others was constantly growing and encouraging us to find a way to create the
best possible longboard one can think of, up to this very second and beyond.</p>
<p>So last year we
finally decided to set up our very own company and by now we have established a
great foundation to be able to produce enough high quality boards following our
standards: handmade &amp; eco friendly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we
appear to be hitting our financial limits as we have pretty much put all the
money we own into our small company. That’s why we need YOUR help to give Wonca
Longboards the push it needs.</p>
<p>So far we have
been selling our longboards mainly locally but of course it is our goal to take
these beauties across the boarders, out into this world and make more people
happy. Who else other than YOU could help us better to accomplish this goal?</p>
<p>With your
support we can go further, merge our creative minds, develop new shapes and improve
the current boards even more. Right now we’re planning a downhill board and a
fish shape. For the downhill board we would need a vacuum press, which we want
to buy from the raised funds.</p>

<p>Our beloved
friend Susi from Berlin is studying fashion design and created our first
handmade hoodies and t-shirts. We are more than proud of wearing our very own
handmade clothes.</p>
<p>Simply buying
cheap t-shirts and having the Wonca logo printed on them is not our style. We
believe in craftsmanship and eco-friendly products by all means. And we also
want to give this handmade feeling to YOU!</p>
<p>If we achieve

We are Wonca
Longboards and we are pretty happy dudes.
Why? Because we
are all good friends and working on this unique project that is our hobby and
passion at the same time. All of us enjoy traveling around the globe, exploring
new cultures and experiencing nature’s diversity while living a healthy and
sustainable lifestyle.
In short: We

what we love. The awareness and demand from our friends, friends of friends and
others was constantly growing and encouraging us to find a way to create the
best possible longboard one can think of, up to this very second and beyond.
So last year we
finally decided to set up our very own company and by now we have established a
great foundation to be able to produce enough high quality boards following our

Unfortunately we
appear to be hitting our financial limits as we have pretty much put all the

So far we have
been selling our longboards mainly locally but of course it is our goal to take

With your
support we can go further, merge our creative minds, develop new shapes and improve

fish shape. For the downhill board we would need a vacuum press, which we want
to buy from the raised funds.

any active cooling solutions, like air conditioners or humidity controllers to build
datacenters. </span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It follows the same principles used by the power transformers industry and is
based on a sealed tank filled up with organic dielectric oil and electronics to
create a new generation of computers.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>1) Why RuggedPOD?</b></p><p align=""justify""><b>Today's datacenters are very expensive and complex tools, becoming unaccessible to new market comers, emerging countries and even mid-size owners.

Here are some pictures of the system with some early outdoor Deployment.This Pod is using Cellular Fins based on pure Aluminium. Our Perks will received this technology which is improving heat exchange by 30% and reduce raw material usage by 25%.RuggedPOD is a revolutionary modular computer chassis that doesn’t require
any active cooling solutions, like air conditioners or humidity controllers to build
datacenters. 
It follows the same principles used by the power transformers industry and is
based on a sealed tank filled up with organic dielectric oil and electronics to
create a new generation of computers.1) Why RuggedPOD?Today's datacenters are very expensive and complex tools, becoming unaccessible to new market comers, emerging countries and even mid-size owners. They are forming the Internet backbone, and deploying them at the right cost with relevant energy management is key. This is why we designed RuggedPOD.2) RuggedPOD goalsOur goals are to limit as much as possible datacenter wastes and costs by reaching:
a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1, 
a Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of 0, 
an optimal Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE) by using energy harvesting
a minus 1 US$ cost per VM (1VPCU/1GB/20GB SSD) 
a fast and easy deployment of critical computing resources
and publishing our technology through an open hardware program to which you can participate.We successfully achieved these by leveraging true free cooling with outdoor computing, and a 2 years R&D program.3) Who are we ?
Experts in the data centers design and in disruptive
products, we created various computers focused on energy efficiency (including fastest fanless PC in the world, and the first server to break 1Gflops/W on the Linpack benchmark). 4) RuggedPOD: The five benefits ! a) True Free Cooling:
No air conditioning
No water usage or humidity control
Incredible but true!b) Everywhere: you can use your RuggedPOD outdoor or indoor.Yes you can use RuggedPOD in desert, in high humidity jungle,  on country side fields, or roofs, as long as it is protected against direct sun light.c) Eco Friendly : 100% of the electricity brought to RuggedPOD is used by electronic devices. The RuggedPOD is fully recyclable. Moreover we have reduced the maximum power consumption of any electronics parts.d) Quick and Easy deployment : adaptive, modular, with easy redeployment and dismantling.e) Standard electronic devices and easy upgrade: support Mini and Micro ATX boards ! Compatible with: Openstack, Windows, Linux, etc.f) Next Steps: Exploring energy harvesting- Heat up greenhouses- Heat up district buildings.- Create free electricity with TEG devices.5) Summary.RuggedPOD datacenter benefits:

the PedalPod and an unlocked bike will still be level and safe in the PedalPod.
Locking simply means that your bike is secure so if you are using a PedalPod
outside or in a garage then you really should be using a strong D-lock or chain
to protect your bike from theft. Slip the lock through the holes on either side
of the PedalPod and through the bike frame to ensure maximum
security.</span><br/></p>

height isn’t a concern as you can mount the PedalPod as low as 500mm from the

</div></div>","PedalPod is a secure yet simple way of
hanging any style of bike, large or small, mountain or road, by its pedal.
Securing a bike in this way means no matter what style of cycle you have we can
secure it!  Capable of supporting up to 25kg depending on the
supporting wall, it is perfect for those who have little space to spare or like
to keep things tidy and out of the way. The PedalPod is currently patent pending (#1520635.2) and all aspects of the logo and name have been trademarked and registered. Perhaps you have a
really nice bike and think it deserves a place to stand out? The product
makes a feature of your bike as the PedalPod can be bolted to all walls
internal or external, therefore your bike could be secured in your front room,
corridor or garage. We are confident that
the PedalPod will also be the first product of its type to obtain ""sold
secure"" status. This means it will be tested against theft to a level
where insurance companies will pay out if your bike is locked to the PedalPod
(if your home insurance covers bikes).HOW IT WORKS


Mounting a bike to a PedalPod is simple and quick to do;


First, strap the crank
arm to the frame of your bike using the nylon strap, make sure it is as tight
as possible. 


(Please note that there are several
different ways of strapping the frame and crank which all depend on what sort
of bike frame you have, you will need to find the perfect way of securing the
strap for your bike!)
Next, lift the bike and
slot the pedal into the PedalPod. The PedalPod works by securing the axle of
the bike pedal, this is the same on every type of bike so it doesn't matter
what size or style pedals you have!
Finally, if security is a concern, use any type of bike lock (although we will
always recommend a strong d-lock or chain!) to loop through the bike frame and
holes in the side of the PedalPod.

Now your bike is stored securely and safely out of the way!  












OUR FUNDING GOAL




Our funding goal
through Indiegogo is £10,000. Achieving this will make great steps in
accomplishing the following;



PACKAGING
The packaging for PedalPod has
already been designed and is waiting to go into production.







PRODUCTION
We have already designed the tool
for manufacture of the plastic inserts and have sourced manufacturers for the
other components so funding will go towards the costs of getting the
manufacturing tool built and putting the PedalPod into production.





SECURITY TESTING
We strive towards producing products that
give top security to bikes. So many bikes are expensive, top brand, lovingly
customised or faithful life servers and of course cyclists want to protect
them.
Using funding we can have the PedalPod
Sold Secure tested and awarded as well as Secured by Design certified, both of
which bike insurers love and often provide discounts to cyclists that keep
their bikes kept in sold secure and secured by design storage.
A lot of the design process for PedalPod
was centred around making the PedalPod as secure as possible so we are very
confident that it will achieve Sold Secure Approval.






COLOUR OPTIONS
Whilst we have deliberately kept
the PedalPod neutral in terms of colour scheme, we know that customers love a
range of colours to choose from! With funding we can produce different colour
schemes and customisation for those who feel the need to theme!







MARKETING
Having a great product is only half the
battle, in order to get the PedalPod the exposure it deserves we need to market
it to the cycling world at Bike Shows and Exhibitions, through media and print
and setting up a PedalPod website and e-store. Part of the funds raised through
Indiegogo will go towards this.

INSTALLING THE
PEDALPOD




PedalPod can be installed on most types of wall and
we recommend the following fixings depending
on different wall types;



For the PedalPod+ we will supply special ball bearing wall fixings which are extra secure and will mean the PedalPod+ cannot be unbolted by thieves. These secure fixings are for a solid wall, such as brick, only.

buckle has been designed to ensure there is no chance of the strap loosening.
In short, if used properly, no it will not break!
Can I buy a replacement strap? Of course,
replacement or additional straps will be available to purchase from our website
for £4.99 + postage.
Do I have to use the strap? If saving
floor space isn't a concern, then you can install the PedalPod at a low level
and allow the bike to rotate until the front wheel can rest on the floor.
Do I have to lock my bike in the
PedalPod? No, locking your bike makes no difference to how the bike is held in
the PedalPod and an unlocked bike will still be level and safe in the PedalPod.
Locking simply means that your bike is secure so if you are using a PedalPod
outside or in a garage then you really should be using a strong D-lock or chain
to protect your bike from theft. Slip the lock through the holes on either side
of the PedalPod and through the bike frame to ensure maximum
security.
What height ceiling height do I need? Ceiling
height isn’t a concern as you can mount the PedalPod as low as 500mm from the
floor. You will need to leave 1100mm clear space from the top of the PedalPod
and ceiling to ensure the handle bars do not clash with the ceiling.
What sort of wall is best to put a
PedalPod on? We recommend a brick/hard wall, however with the correct fixings
a plaster/dry wall is also fine. Please see our recommended fixings chart for
more information on which fixings to buy.
Where can I buy fixings? All the fixings we recommend can be
purchased from your local DIY or home improvement depot/store. 
What does Sold Secure mean? Sold Secure is
an organisation that assess and test all security products to
award them with either Bronze, Silver or Gold certification. We have already
had 2 of our other products tested by Sold Secure and have achieved all three
certifications so we know what we are doing when it comes to designing secure
bike storage! Insurance companies are more likely to give you discounts or
better rates for bike insurance if you store your bike in a Sold Secure
certified product. 
What
is Secured by Design? Secured by Design
is a UK Police initiative that focuses on 'designing out crime' and
acknowledges quality security products. In their own words - 'Secured
by Design member company status is awarded to companies producing security
products that pass standards and tests nominated by the police service. The
standards and related tests must demonstrate the product effectiveness in
preventing or reducing crime, usually by resistance to physical attack.'






WHO
ARE WE?




PedalPod is the latest design from bike storage
manufacturer Cyclepods. 
Cyclepods is all about bikes and
cyclists. Our total focus is on helping cyclists feel more confident that their
bikes are being held securely, and safely, in locations which fit with their
travel and commuting plans. We believe that bike storage for the
21st Century should be stylish, secure and most of all space-saving.
Cyclepods was started in 2005 by our Creative
Director, James Steward. James was a student in Design at Nottingham University
when his bike was stolen. Being his only form of transport as a financially
strapped student, the loss of his bike affected his day to day life as well as
being deeply frustrating!
It was then that James decided to use his skills as
a designer to create a bike storage solution that was secure but also made a
statement, so that bikes don’t need to be stored in cramped, rusty stands
hidden at the back of buildings. 
Together with his partner Natalie
Connell, they launched Cyclepods and have since installed bike storage
solutions all over the UK in schools, rail, businesses, parks and public
spaces. We have also designed a number of unique bike storage solutions with
safety and security for cyclists always being our top priority.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

We do this by removing the bulk of the pillow from the back of the neck and filling the side bolsters instead. This side support gently lifts your head to its natural position by providing enough firmness to support the weight of your head – allowing your neck and shoulder muscles to relax. This in turn reduces muscle strain, while properly aligning your windpipe.

The pillow features meticulously crafted ergonomic design features that combine to gently tilt the head back towards its natural state: an inner skeleton for structural resilience, thermosensitive memory foam that holds its form, and a thin neck band and hefty side bolsters that conform to your neck and collar bones. All combine to support the head in order to reduce lateral flexion, reduce soreness, and promote healthier breathing and more a restful sleep. A Modern Pillow for the Modern AgeMost travel pillows don’t provide enough support where it’s needed – at the sides and front of the head and neck. Inflatables don’t adapt to the human form, beads disperse, cushions don't hold their shape – and none offer anything beyond a softer surface to lean on. This is what we set out to change.The basic design of travel pillows hasn’t changed in over sixty years. Though most modern transportation now comes with built-in headrests. So that extra material behind your neck is pushing your head forward, causing tension, soreness and restricting breathing.   The ScienceWorking with engineers and medical professionals we researched how travelers actually sleep on planes, trains, buses and automobiles. We then took all our data and started to design something that we wanted to use ourselves. We took a long, honest look at every prototype. We wanted to make it perfect. And we have.  We started shaving down pillows to find the perfect form. Many collapsed. We looked at different core structures, from exoskeletons to articulated plastic to aluminium spines. We designed, tested, iterated and repeated. 50+ prototypes and much collaboration with kinesiologists, doctors, engineers and designers later, we settled on just the right blended memory foam density to fit your form while preserving the ergonomic integrity of the pillow.  By rethinking the form and material density, SONO Pillow promotes more natural, unobstructed breathing while reducing muscle strain and lateral flexion – that is, the overextension of the muscles in the side of your neck. We do this by removing the bulk of the pillow from the back of the neck and filling the side bolsters instead. This side support gently lifts your head to its natural position by providing enough firmness to support the weight of your head – allowing your neck and shoulder muscles to relax. This in turn reduces muscle strain, while properly aligning your windpipe. Both of which lead to more natural breathing, higher oxygen absorption, and ultimately a better healthier sleep.     The Travel BagWe're proud of SONO Pillow. It's the result of a lot of research, collaboration and hard work, so naturally we want to take care of it. This is why we designed a travel bag to keep it as clean and convenient to carry as possible. We've added a passport pocket to keep your documents within easy reach while in transit, and selected durable, water-resistance materials and added a shoulder strap to allow it to double as a day pack.   Select Your ColourFor the first time, we're proud to offer three new colour options in addition to classic black.   The ReviewsWe sent the SONO Pillow far and wide to see how it performed on the road.""Elevating (the travel pillow) to a new level of comfort"" – The Huffington Post“Five out of five” – GadgetFlow“SONO Pillow will help you sleep like a rock on the plane” – Trend Hunter“SONO Pillow provides total comfort” – Gamin Traveler“SONO Pillow is a must have to rest your weary head” – Paul Foster“The travel essential I didn’t know I needed” – MillieGoes     Free ShippingDid we mention all of our pillows come with FREE shipping?    The CoverWe all know the traveling environment isn't the most sanitary. One big challenge for us was to find the healthiest, skin-friendly, allergen-repelling material we could. Cotton traps allergens, spandex lacked durability, and most others lacked comfort. We also wanted the material to be machine washable, so as to offer the most comfortable and clean travel experience possible.We finally settled on hypoallergenic velour for it’s allergen free – and washable – properties.    FlexibilityTo maintain ergonomic integrity, it was crucial the pillow be rigid enough to hold its shape. After much trial error we discovered the perfect blended memory foam combined with a internal spine that allows the SONO Pillow to stay in place no matter how you like to sleep. It conforms to your shoulders and neck maintaining its form while being soft enough to ensure a good nights sleep.   Stretch Goal: The SONO Sculpted Eye MaskLess of a stretch goal and more of a stretch gift! If we manage to break $25K in fund raising, we'll ship each SONO Pillow with a 3D eye mask as our way of saying thank you.With its cave like shape and blackout quality, the eye mask relieves pressure on the eyes and doesn’t disturb carefully applied makeup or eyelashes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This idea blossomed from 6 months in the COVID-19 Pandemic. I wanted something to do. I started looking up cabins in Big Bear - too expensive… I switched to Hotels -too many people (and still too close to reality), and while we have a tent and supplies, the idea of packing everything just to sleep on the floor just didn’t feel “it”. I finally came across an RV sharing website that I will be forever grateful for. The website has various types of Vans and Pop up campers but while they were all so perfect for what the goal was, they were just as expensive as a hotel. In that moment I decided that I could make something better, for less. I feel that once we go back to our daily ""normal"" lives, we should not be okay with the one (or less) vacation a year that we limit ourselves to. Anything that separates you from the normality of life is a vacation. If people need to work out multiple times a week to keep their body in shape, we must have to something similar for our mental health.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Everyone who donates can get a free night (per $50.00 donated) of camper rental once the project is completed! The initial goal id $5,000 but the more we raise, the better technology we can add to each camper. Unfortunately, campers are expensive, so $5,000 is barely enough to purchase and refurbish a camper. The goal is to add small solar panels to keep lights on and batteries charged, a small propane gas stove attached to the storage units, and depending on funding, a camper refurbish of a sink and personal bathroom  (more comfort requires more funds :c ) but that can only happen with time, money and willpower!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe this idea can help students and families alike. Like mentioned before, things in SoCal are expensive. No wonder people cant take time off without worrying about breaking the bank! I want to change that. I grew up camping and spent the last 5 years in the Hospitality and Tourism industry. I know what people want, and need to enjoy a night away from home and especially what they need in camping. All you need is the food!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is only one risk, but its a big one. People. don't. reserve. While we hope for the best, and have plans to promote on almost every social media website possible (excluding twitter... I don't understand it) we must prepare for the worst. If anything, all the money raised can make the dream come true and the business of renting the one camper will never die. But we might not be able to grow. If the project fails, $25.00 a night will be the standard rate for all the indiegogo sponsors, because all those who help will mean the word to me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, no worries, spreading the word can help if you share the same dreams as I. Together we can start a new generation of traveling. </p>

<p>Hi, and thanks for checking out our campaign!</p>
<p>So who are we?

<p>Over the years we have commuted to work, whilst walking through town or even the countryside all we see is litter... EVERYWHERE! Especially non-reusable paper cups, not to mention the plastic lid! <br/><br/>But why do we continue to waste when we could just re-use?</p>

Over the years we have commuted to work, whilst walking through town or even the countryside all we see is litter... EVERYWHERE! Especially non-reusable paper cups, not to mention the plastic lid! But why do we continue to waste when we could just re-use?

We would love to reach our funding goal, but if we don't then any support will have already gone a long way! If we do, we will continue to explore other reusable everyday items that can be released to market.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Me and my sons love active sports like snowboarding, running etc.</p>
<p>When I am chasing my boys down the slope, I feel hot and sweaty, while riding the lift up the mountain I am cold. I need my garments to keep me warm when I am sitting in lift chair as well as when I am dashing downhill.</p>
<p>Thus came the Caliente heated garments idea. I have been working with IoT since late 1990s so integrating the IoT controls and other electronics was not so difficult. Caliente is a line of winter garments with integrated heating elements and heating control. These are light weight garments that replace bulky winter clothing. </p>
<p>I have spent last 8 months sourcing materials and technology. We are testing a full set of product samples and IoT controls. Everything is looking good. Next stage is to place a bulk order.</p>
<p>This is where I need your help! With your pledge and support I will have enough funding to buy bulk product to enter the market.</p>
<p>To succeed, I need $30,000 for inventory and other expenses. If I do not meet my goal, I will manage and grow at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Support this campaign and be first to own most comfortable winter garments. Show off this winter, you made it happen.</p>

</div></div>","What´s it about:Mzuzo is a browser and app based service designed to show its users how to explore cities while in airport transit. It will tell what is possible to do and see in the time available, how to get there and most importantly how to get back to catch the connecting flight. 

Most frequent travelers know those long, annoying hours spent waiting for connecting flights that too often are scheduled too many hours away. Food and drink are as expensive as the duty free shops are repetitive. When finally one takes off one might catch a glimpse of the magnificent city one has just spent an entire day in but seen nothing of. With the help of mzuzo and its companion app  you can now use these hours to explore the city. We will tell you how to get to the places you always wanted to see and most importantly how to get back to the airport in time.  I have been flying around this globe my whole life. First of all because I love traveling, then after, moving county to visit ""home"" and now to see my grown children who are spread over 3 continents. 
Cheaper flights normally come with long layovers. I have made it a habit to leave the airports to do some sight seeing and with this seen some places I would have never gotten to otherwise. I have also realized that most people would love to do the same but don't  quiet dare.  
Out of this Mzuzo was born. 



And this is how it Works:
       Home screen:
     :  
 
After receiving
 basic data from the user such as destination, arrival/departure
times, nationality and interests a suggested list of attractions to visit is
generated. 

In this sample the user has a layover in Paris and the options to  to visit the Eifel Tower, the Louvre, Momart, a Rodin exhibition and Notre Dame.


         2. Choice screen:






Once you chosen what you like to do we will work out an exact itinerary, of how to get to your chosen destination (with public transport or taxi) and back, how long it takes, the costs involved  info on poi and many other useful tips about your trip and destination. 


The user can then select a destination of choice and a detailed itinerary is displayed. The following information is provided::
Transport
options, costs involved, map, info on poi, map, c
ommon
phrases, and where possible ticket buy options.  

       3. Result screen:







Mzuzo is to develop a network covering all major airports and with this becoming the  only one-stop-shop for stopover travelers. It will change the way we view air travel. What once was the most annoying part of of any journey can now be a bonus, an adventure in itself. 




The technology around this product is based on Mobile Development for IOS and Android, as most of
our users will access the Mzuzo platform from mobile devices. HTML, CSS and Javascript web
based development will be used for the front end of the public website. In conjunction with the above
code languages we will also use Django Framwork to implement the back-end logic for the web apps.
Rest API is to be deployed to support the Mobile Apps. 
Our biggest challenge will be the implementation of intelligent algorithms that
will automate the data selection and then recommend optimal tour options based on the users profile
and preferences. A Beta phase will be vital to ensure comprehensive user experience and testing of
the application. 
Our time line:
The initial testing phase in our lab has taken place over the last 3 months. With a solid base, the first
edition of our product can now be developed; this stage will be completed by mid 2015. The app will
run for a month in Beta phase to iron out any initial problems.

<p><a href=""http://www.rocketstar.nyc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rocketstar</a>, LLC, is a rocket engine company based in New York City, currently developing a new generation of rocket engines, beginning with an aerospike engine intended to democratize space and unlock its promise of the future by creating a cost-effective, reusable, reliable, environmentally friendly and highly cost effective rocket engine. RocketStar’s aerospike technology is far superior to the traditional multi-stage, single-use and relatively expensive rockets adopted by the space industry. RocketStar’s aerospike engine will serve to hasten milestones in space exploration, space tourism and, ultimately, space colonization.</p>
<h3>OUR VISION:</h3>
<p><i><b>To create new standards in hypersonic propulsion used for space exploration and, ultimately, colonization of the Solar System, thereby helping to ensure the future of humanity.</b></i></p>

<h3>WHAT'S AN AEROSPIKE ROCKET ENGINE?<br/>WHY IS IT SO EXCITING?</h3>
<p>Aerospike engines are the answer to space travel. Current bell nozzles, which have worked to get us to space since the 60's, are lacking the economies of scale required to make space travel routine. What is the challenge for which we are providing a solution? We are creating an altitude compensating engine, so we don't have to throw away the rocket every time we go up, we can keep reusing it over and over again.</p>
<p>Traditional bell nozzles have a static pressure within the bell, they do not change as they move through the atmosphere, even as the Earth's atmosphere does.  To compensate for the loss of thrust, rocket companies are forced to throw away the engine for a larger bell nozzle, hence the need for stages.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1309602/files/20150319204953-fig11a.jpg?1426823393"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Aerospikes have no need to do that.  They are open to the atmosphere and thus have a one-to-one correlation with the atmosphere change, preserving thrust.</p>

<p>We are appealing to individuals who have been inspired by human accomplishment in space. Whether it was the moon landings, deep space probes, Space Shuttle, rendezvous with a comet or plans to colonize Mars, there  is tremendous interest in what lies for us out in space.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $250,000 for completion of an aerospike rocket engine prototype and to conduct a comprehensive Burn Test, both of which are required prior to building a full-fledged engine.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Computational Fluid Dynamics Test (CFD):</b> we will do thorough computer testing to robustly check our design.</li>
<li>
<b>Finalize design of proprietary nozzle and begin patent process:</b> Once the CFD analysis is completed, we can implement our design process for a new generation aerospike engine.</li>
<li>
<b>Build test prototype:</b> creation of a fully functional small scale prototype for testing, diagnostics and data capture for analysis.</li>

</div></div>","WHAT IS ROCKETSTAR?
Rocketstar, LLC, is a rocket engine company based in New York City, currently developing a new generation of rocket engines, beginning with an aerospike engine intended to democratize space and unlock its promise of the future by creating a cost-effective, reusable, reliable, environmentally friendly and highly cost effective rocket engine. RocketStar’s aerospike technology is far superior to the traditional multi-stage, single-use and relatively expensive rockets adopted by the space industry. RocketStar’s aerospike engine will serve to hasten milestones in space exploration, space tourism and, ultimately, space colonization.
OUR VISION:
To create new standards in hypersonic propulsion used for space exploration and, ultimately, colonization of the Solar System, thereby helping to ensure the future of humanity.


WHAT'S AN AEROSPIKE ROCKET ENGINE?WHY IS IT SO EXCITING?
Aerospike engines are the answer to space travel. Current bell nozzles, which have worked to get us to space since the 60's, are lacking the economies of scale required to make space travel routine. What is the challenge for which we are providing a solution? We are creating an altitude compensating engine, so we don't have to throw away the rocket every time we go up, we can keep reusing it over and over again.
Traditional bell nozzles have a static pressure within the bell, they do not change as they move through the atmosphere, even as the Earth's atmosphere does.  To compensate for the loss of thrust, rocket companies are forced to throw away the engine for a larger bell nozzle, hence the need for stages.



Aerospikes have no need to do that.  They are open to the atmosphere and thus have a one-to-one correlation with the atmosphere change, preserving thrust.





Benefits of Aerospike technology:


Single-Stage-to-Orbit - as opposed to using multiple stages, which are the discarded after each use.

Reusable Launch Vehicle - as opposed to one use and done.

Cost Effective - 40% increased thrust and over 50% weight savings.


Environmentally Friendly - liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellant yields a water byproduct.

Thrust Vectoring - yields extreme accuracy and maneuverability.


   WHY WE NEED THE FUNDS 
We are appealing to individuals who have been inspired by human accomplishment in space. Whether it was the moon landings, deep space probes, Space Shuttle, rendezvous with a comet or plans to colonize Mars, there  is tremendous interest in what lies for us out in space.
Our goal is to raise $250,000 for completion of an aerospike rocket engine prototype and to conduct a comprehensive Burn Test, both of which are required prior to building a full-fledged engine.
Deliverables – funding will be used to accomplish the following development milestones by March 2016:


Computational Fluid Dynamics Test (CFD): we will do thorough computer testing to robustly check our design.

Finalize design of proprietary nozzle and begin patent process: Once the CFD analysis is completed, we can implement our design process for a new generation aerospike engine.

Build test prototype: creation of a fully functional small scale prototype for testing, diagnostics and data capture for analysis.

Comprehensive prototype burn test: with full diagnostics and data capture -- this will allow us to show our prospective clients how well our rocket engine performs.



REWARD LEVELS


The Impact You shall be contributing to and, thereby, participating in humankind's unprecedented access to space.
The campaign will provide individuals with a special opportunity to participate directly in space technology that will facilitate the overarching quest to routinely move humans beyond the confines of Earth. There are several levels of participation, ranging from $1 to $50,000, with compelling custom curated rewards for each level of funding.
With each level, you not only have the pride of being part of mankind's space era, but you will receive awards that let you cherish your involvement.  We have designed specific mission patches for this event, just like the mission patches that were awarded to the crews of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the other heroes of the Space Age.

The Mission Patch


Glow-in-the-Dark Patch


Zefram Cochrane Patch - In Star Trek: First Contact, Zefram Cochrane created the first functional warp drive and then made first contact with the Vulcans.  It was the beginning of a new age for humanity.  In honor of Leonard Nimoy and all the cast and crew of Star Trek and their vision of a new age, we have created this special award.

We have also designed the following items as rewards for your generous support:

High quality pin  (for illustration purposes only)Mars Pen - guaranteed to write until man sets foot on Mars

Medallions  (for illustration purposes only)
These rewards proudly signal your involvement with RocketStar and the quest for space.  Higher donations will receive more thanks and more collectibles exemplifying your support for this mission.
Finally, for super donors we have reserved: 

Custom-made Apollo era flight jacket - painstakingly recreated from Colonel Al Worden's Apollo 15 jacket

Astronaut Helmet specially commissioned by Rockstar(for illustration purposes only)
Orlan Astronaut suit replica based on the space suit used by both NASA and the Russian's since the 1970's  (for illustration purposes only)
And last, but not least, we have reserved one slot for someone to NAME THE ENGINE.  The name that you choose will go down in history on the next generation rocket engine that will get us into space! This individual will also start and be present for our Burn Test, as well as be flown out to the east coast for dinner with the whole team.



Risks & Challenges

 There are obviously major challenges that need to be overcome and resolved.  This is not rocketry, this is rocket science.  
That is why we have assembled a team of experts in mechanical engineering to solve this issue.  They have worked on problems for major engineering firms in the past, and have the knowledge to overcome the challenges presented.  In addition, on our advisory board we have a founding member of NASA as well as several scientists that have in their belts such discoveries as water on Mars and on the Moon.  They are used to very large problems and finding solutions in a measured and deliberate manner.  Combine that with our other advisory board members and consultants who all specialize in Finance, Marketing, and have deep connections in the industry, we feel we have a winning team that can make things happen.

We are Andrew and Fiona, two Scottish entrepreneurs passionate about changing the world of holiday accommodation, especially the lodge and mobile home sector. We would love you to join us as we build the prototype Kranôg!</p><h3>The cabin of the future, now</h3><p>The Kranôg brings together existing off-grid technologies to create something that has never been done before: a luxury, design-led, off-grid cabin, utilising 100% renewable energy and rainwater and making zero harmful emissions to the environment. As the design is modular and doesn’t need intrusive foundations, it can easily be located anywhere using normal farm machinery (no cranes necessary!) and it falls within ‘light touch’ mobile-home planning regulations. This means that it also opens up new possibilities for rural and remote communities to earn a living from tourism without spoiling the landscape and environment that visitors come to enjoy.</p><h3>Sustainable, design-led, celtic roots</h3><p>Inspired by ancient Scottish bronze-age dwellings (Crannogs), the Kranôg is designed to connect people with their environment; visually, but also by challenging guests to think about how they use resources. Guests will be able to easily monitor their power and water use. If they are running low they will be able to top up using a manual pump, or reduce electricity consumption by turning off devices. </p><p>The unit is 100% Scottish designed and built. It is built to last, with a certified design life of at least 80 years. We are especially proud of the toilets: the guest just sees a normal clean flushing toilet.

In that scenario we may have to take on personal loans ourselves – whatever happens we are 100% committed to making this happen. </p><p>Our approach has been to pre-empt the risks to this project.

<p>Ever sleep on a cot that feels stiff and uncomfortable? The turbocot has no cross-bars from top to bottom, left to right!, which means it feels like sleeping on a hammock!  Cumbersome crossbars on other cots at the top and bottom and even the middle make a good night's sleep hard to find! Now you no longer run the risk of bruising your head or feet, or wake up with numbness! The contour hammock design allows you to lie down, and feel comfortable, no rolling around and making creaking noises all night long!</p>

Say hello to the TurboCot by WolfTraders.  Unlike most other crowdfunding projects, we've already sold our first truckload of turbocots.  We took them to trade-shows, and sold to some outdoor retailers with great response... they all want more!!   Now, we want to get this product out to the masses, but we need your help to make that happen. We are working out of my brothers garage, we have another order of turbocots on the way, but this won't be enough and we now have so many more people that want our products with no way to get them made.. We hope you will step aboard and join the ""wolfpak"" we know you will love our products as others already have. We are excited about the possibilities that we can achieve with your backing support!

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Created by a group of respected journalists and wildlife travel professionals, Safarious started as an online forum to bring enthusiasts and experts in conservation and wilderness tourism together in one place. Under the stewardship of veteran South African journalists, Tony Weaver and Anton Crone, It has evolved into a highly respected news source for conservation issues and a key resource for wilderness travel.</p>
<p>Safarious has attracted an audience of passionate conservationists, wilderness travellers, and travel professionals, and with your help we can turn it into <i>the </i>go-to-place for people who are passionate about conserving and travelling to the world's wild places.</p>
<p><strong>Over time we've added loads of useful tools and features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A professionally-curated online magazine and news desk which is garnering more and more respect in the conservation and wilderness travel world.</li>
<li>Enhanced self-publishing tools so our community can post travel stories and images in a quality format.</li>
<li>In-depth country guides for travel research.</li>
<li>In April this year we added an exciting new travel portal where visitors can search for  accommodation and experiences, build their own itineraries and recruit travel operators to help make their dream trips come true. </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why we're asking for funding</strong></h3>
<p><strong>To promote ethical journalism</strong></p>
<p>We see a dire lack of well-balanced, informative journalism available on conservation, wilderness travel and local communities. Readers are often exposed to a mad clutter of opinions and misinformation, reports that are funded by organisations with vested interests, news that is sensationalist or fake, and unethical publications that steal material from the original sources.</p>
<p>We aim to be the antidote to this. It's important to have funding to pay professional journalists and news sources such as Reuters and AFP. Your support can help us achieve this so our readers get the best possible information on our website. </p>
<p><strong>To avoid advertising</strong></p>
<p>Ours is a community-focused website. We don't offer advertising space because we don't want to be led by marketing agendas. It also means we keep our website clean and easy to navigate. Without advertising funding we need an alternative source of income.</p>
<div>
<h3>The bottom line</h3>
<p>We calculate that we need US$60,000 for the next twelve months for our magazine and news desk to be fully operational. We will renew this campaign after twelve months if successful to keep the momentum going. </p>
<p><strong>Funds will go towards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paying professional journalists</li>
<li>Paying respected news sources</li>
<li>Web development and maintenance</li>
</ul>
<div><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3></div>
<div>
<p>With your support we can raise the standard of journalism in the world of conservation and wilderness travel and educate the public on the real conservation issues that need attention.</p>
<h3>What if we don't reach our funding goal?</h3>

<p>A percent of profits are always given to charities of our choosing. We do not say this for grandstanding, to be 'eco-friendly tours', or any sort of marketing really; it's just a matter of personal principle and you have a right to know where your money is going. </p>
<p>We've recently partnered up with the <a href=""http://www.amanikids.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amani Children’s Home</a> in Moshi, Tanzania. So a small percent will be going there and to a environmental/animal rights charity yet to be determined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A larger percent will be going toward the website: background systems, databases,  security, and some new cutting edge media ideas we had to get people really excited for the trips. </p>
<p>Not just our trips, but for travel in general. </p>
<p>Travel has so greatly effected our lives, that it's only nature we give back. We both solemnly agree that the world would be a much more peaceful, open, and accepting place... if other just traveled more. And not just travel, but truly engage with one another. </p>

We hope that bringing a marquee cycling project to Durham will enhance the Triangle cycling scene.            </span><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p>

<p>The park will
welcome riders of all abilities. At any given time, you might discover cyclists ranging from
balance-biking kids to youth cycling on
teams and in camps to families and
friends looking for fun and fitness to mountain bikers and BMX riders
pushing their skills to the next level.  Our motto describes how we see the genesis of Bull City Bike Park:</p>
<p><b>We build it together</b> by helping fund, design and create it.  </p>
<p><b>We ride it together </b>by coming for the day or becoming members and sharing the park with our families and friends.</p>
<p><b>We have fun together</b> by enjoying an indoor playground for bikes where we can all feel like kids again.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo crowd-funding campaign will help in three important ways to launch this business. Firstly, it will spread the story of Bull City Bike Park. Secondly, it will demonstrate customer-demand and in doing so convince investors to back the idea. Lastly, it will raise the startup funds to help secure our location.  Please contribute what you can and invite your friends, family and riding communities to do the same.  Thanks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this round of funding we are aiming for $50,000.  The initial goal  is to raise funds to help secure a location.  Perhaps even more importantly, active participation at this stage will show potential investors that there is widespread demand for an indoor mountain bike park in Durham.  The more supporters we have, the better business case we have for investment in the project and the more likely we are to get the additional funding necessary to get the doors open.</p>
<p>To make this more exciting for our crowd funders, we are offering some fun perks to go along with our fundraising.  The perks will range from branded Bull City Bike Park gear to park passes and memberships for individuals or families.  Every donation helps make the business case; higher donations earn bigger perks.  Check out our perks and please give what you can.  Thanks.</p>

<p>North Carolina is a great place to ride.  But are enough people looking for an alternative to the gym, a place to grow their skills, learn to be better riders and ride in any weather, any time of the year?  We need to prove that there are enough of us who want this park.  Crowd funding allows us to build excitement in the community, spread the word about this project and create a strong business case for further investment.</p>
<p>We hope that you will not only be able to make a donation but that you will also connect us to others who would like to make Bull City Bike Park a reality.  You may only be able to give $20; however, if you share our information with others like a riding club or parents looking for great camps, you could multiply your impact!  The indoor mountain bike parks that exist around the country draw visitors from around the world.  We think that the Triangle deserves just such a destination!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Opening any new business has lots of risks.  We have identified three main risks as we developed our business plan.  The first is the normal challenge of covering all of the costs of running the business--insurance, advertising, rent, taxes, employee costs, etc.  As we wrote the business plan, we discovered that bigger is better.  A larger park has some challenges. It is more expensive, takes longer to build and it is harder to find suitable locations.  But the benefits outweigh these risks.  More people can ride at the same time and the park can provide more types of riding areas.  We also have room to continue to add and update features without closing the park.  More space means that we can accommodate lots of riding levels and have plenty of interesting terrain for every type of rider.</p>
<p>As we looked at the business obstacles, we saw that the second and third major challenges are actually connected--acquiring funding and customers.  Advertising this kind of business with the normal marketing strategies is prohibitively expensive.  Of course, we will do some advertising, but we needed to find a different way to engage<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> our core customer base.  This connection is why we chose to lead this project with a crowd-funding campaign instead of first securing other funding, beginning to build and </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">then</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> looking for customers.  We will use this crowd-funding campaign to simultaneously </span>gauge<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> our customer base, reach potential new customers and justify the investments in the business.  Please help us make the business case.</span></p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hey there! We are Braeden and Caroline, a couple from Calgary, Alberta, raising money to support our year long adventure in Australia and surrounding countries!<br/><br/><b>""Why are you going to Australia?""</b><br/>Like any crazy adolescent just wrapping up high school, we needed to find a way to educate ourselves further and grow in self.  However, unlike other people our age, we are seeking this growth not through university or college, but rather through travel and adventure.  While recognizing that university is probably a must someday (Yes, I know I need to go Dad! Stop bugging me!), we believe that learning is also to be had through the spirit of adventure! While we may not end up with a piece of paper certifying us as responsible adults ready for a career, the cultures and people we run into will make us fundamentally better people, and will improve our understanding of the world around us.  <br/><br/><b>""Can we come with you?""</b><br/>Unfortunately... No. <br/>Howeverrrrr... naturally, (as the crazy adolescents we are) we believe that we are half-decent photographers and even better Instagram-mers, so you can be sure that if you support us you will be seeing a lot of our faces in photos posted on social media, as well as the beautiful scenery and people that we run into along the way. At the end of our trip, a select few of these photos will be turned into a gorgeous coffee table book! As well, we intend to frequently blog about our experiences (Maybe even vlog? If enough people want it, who knows!) so it will be almost like you are there with us! (just close your eyes and imaginneeeee)  All in all it will be an immersive experience for you, the supporter, and you will thoroughly enjoy it alongside us!  (That or you'll hate it.  I don't know you or what you like!)<br/><br/><b>""What can I do to help?!""</b><br/>Well how kind of you to offer! Obviously trips like these need money to sustain, and that's where you, our (hopefully) very wealthy donor, come in. You see, as fresh out of high-school as we are, money is sliiiightly hard to come by.

We are Braeden and Caroline, a couple from Calgary, Alberta, raising money to support our year long adventure in Australia and surrounding countries!""Why are you going to Australia?""Like any crazy adolescent just wrapping up high school, we needed to find a way to educate ourselves further and grow in self.  However, unlike other people our age, we are seeking this growth not through university or college, but rather through travel and adventure.  While recognizing that university is probably a must someday (Yes, I know I need to go Dad! Stop bugging me!), we believe that learning is also to be had through the spirit of adventure! While we may not end up with a piece of paper certifying us as responsible adults ready for a career, the cultures and people we run into will make us fundamentally better people, and will improve our understanding of the world around us.  ""Can we come with you?""Unfortunately... No. Howeverrrrr... naturally, (as the crazy adolescents we are) we believe that we are half-decent photographers and even better Instagram-mers, so you can be sure that if you support us you will be seeing a lot of our faces in photos posted on social media, as well as the beautiful scenery and people that we run into along the way. At the end of our trip, a select few of these photos will be turned into a gorgeous coffee table book! As well, we intend to frequently blog about our experiences (Maybe even vlog? If enough people want it, who knows!) so it will be almost like you are there with us! (just close your eyes and imaginneeeee)  All in all it will be an immersive experience for you, the supporter, and you will thoroughly enjoy it alongside us!  (That or you'll hate it.  I don't know you or what you like!)""What can I do to help?!""Well how kind of you to offer! Obviously trips like these need money to sustain, and that's where you, our (hopefully) very wealthy donor, come in. You see, as fresh out of high-school as we are, money is sliiiightly hard to come by.

Hello people!
My name is Serena Celani, I am Italian and
I live in Rome.
I'm 39 years old and work at the Italian
Red Cross.
I graduated in Economics and I got a
Master's degree in ""International
Policies and Global Environmental Protection"".
My father is Luigi Celani, mechanical
designer and planner specializing in structures, installations and equipment of
yachts, sailboats and motor.
He has started very young inventing
disparate products, some patented, for his own and on commission of companies.
Our campaign is designed to launch a
start-up in order to produce and market the DuoBike, latest invention of my
father but the first one to want to be produced directly from us.  
This is why your help is so important for us. Managing to obtain funds both for patent
protection at European level and
to start a production
would be the goal that contributors could
help us achieve because we alone are not able
to face such charges.
   What We Need & What You Get 
The $
170,000 goal we have set is the amount necessary to cover patent expenses and production
start. Unfortunately, the
expenses to be addressed for the
protection of a patent are many
and sometimes substantial,
to be added to those necessary
for the start of production.
For an inventor the biggest satisfaction is
precisely to produce the invention directly. Selling the invention demeans the rights and committed efforts.
We offer some perks, which are for us a way
to thank for the help and for your contribution. 
We offer the possibility of being cited as
funding contributors on our site which will be modified and enriched or the
chance to get a discount coupon on the future purchase price of a DuoBike,
price that unfortunately we can not currently define but which will amount
roughly between 2000 and 3000 euro (2200 - 3300 US dollars).
Even if we do not reach the entire goal,
the funds raised there will still be useful to address first of all the patent
expenses.

    The Impact 
Our project could make it available for everyone
the use of a vehicle in muscle energy, offering greater safety and ease of use
than the normal bicycle but similar motion performance and evolution.
You would have available a new vehicle, practical and unsurpassed for use in cities
but also fun for
trips out of town.
We really hope to start a DuoBike production considering
that in the past, despite the validity of the various patents of my father, the
lack of economic resources it
has determined their commercial failure.
A case
in point: in 1967 my father
invented and patented in Italy
a water moto ski. Some famous companies manufacturers of similar
products were interested in building and producing this invention.
Unfortunately, not having my father the necessary funds to international patent protection, the proposals fell on deaf ears, and one of these houses has indeed proceeded to the building in own of a similar product but, because altered, has
not had the expected success.

    Risks & Challenges  
The risk is that of not having sufficient resources to address the many expenses that characterize a patent and for a start up company.
Being our product
a good product, designed in detail and tested, albeit still
in the prototype stage, we are
confident that once in the market
will be appreciated by a good slice of it.
That is why your help is needed, in
terms of contribution and also
to spread the word, to help us to
meet the challenge and avoid the risk.
    Other Ways You Can Help So folks  get the word out and make some noise about our campaign please! Use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>
</div>","Try the GoSun Technology for just $59
GoSun Stove has revolutionized fuel-free cooking over the past three years. Now we are making our award winning solar cooking technology even more accessible and educational. After months of development the Dogger was born.
From the Field to the Classroom
Having developed a matching Educational Kit to explain the principles behind the stove, we aim to get the Solar Dogger into classrooms around the world. With your help we can make that a reality!

 


Mini but Mighty
Dogger is a portable, durable stove that belongs everywhere from the ballpark to the classroom. Using the same vacuum tube and compound parabolic reflectors as the GoSun Sport and GoSun Grill, the Dogger can roast a couple hotdogs, sausages or taquitos in minutes and will not leave you hungry in cloudy or cold weather.
 

More than a Toy
With the optional Dogger Plus Educational Kit, children and adults of all ages can learn the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) principles behind the GoSun Solar Cooking Technology while tasting the power of the Sun first hand (more on the contents of the Educational Kit below).
 

Take it Anywhere
The Dogger packs into a durable, 2 LB clamshell case, perfect for any occasion. You can leave it in your car, so you're always ready when hunger strikes. 

 

Fire-Free Fun
Thanks to the vacuum tube’s near perfect insulation, the entire outside of the stove remains cool to touch while the inside hits temperatures up to 550°F/280°C.

More than just Hot Dogs
Delicious options include taquitos, spring rolls, tater tots and veggie dogs.
 

360° of Favor
The tubular cooking quality is unmatched.  The tube creates even temperatures throughout and prevents food from drying out by trapping moisture. The vacuum's insulation keeps your meal hot and ready to eat, whenever you are. 






There is no comparison; what you're seeing is NOT SMOKE AND MIRRORS.  GoSun Stove is already making 1,000's of customers happy to cook using JUST SUNLIGHT.  What?! Do you think Solar Energy is the Under Dogger? Think again...






Not convinced yet? Prepare for the WOW  factor.
Watch the full length (3:20) Video below:











Reflectors double as shields 
Protect your GoSun on the Go.  Grab the Dogger, some bun (bread of any kind), condiments and your favorite tubular food. Jump on the boat, bike, beach or bus. 


Roast from sun up to sun down
With the help to the integrated Multi-Position Base and Kickstand.  A full range of of sunlight angles, wavelengths and intensity are absorbed; from 0° to 75° tilt and ultraviolet through infrared.

<h1>Robit technical details:</h1>
<b>Movement</b><br/>Robit drives on 3 wheels: the two front ones are powered by 2 powerful DC motors and the back wheel is free. The 2 front wheels have wheel encoders that count the number of rounds so Robit knows the speed and distance of his movement<br/><br/><b>Head and Neck</b><br/>The head can move up and down and right to left powered by 2 servo motors. The neck moves up and down with a servo motor. <br/><br/><b>The Real Time Board (Firmware)<br/></b>Robit
 has a built in real time board similar to an Arduino. This board 
controls the hardware directly: the motors, the sensors, etc. The board 
has an API that can be accessed, although we recommend using our hi-level
 API.<br/><b><br/>Computer Board (The brain)<br/></b>Robit is powered 
by a single board computer (Raspberry Pi). This computer includes a 4 
quad CPU (ARM), 1 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of SSD memory for storing things 
like apps, music, etc.<br/><b><br/>Connectivity</b><br/>Robit connects to the home WiFi with a Wi-Fi card and an Antenna so it's always in range. Robit
 also has Bluetooth that you can use when WiFi is not available. When 
using BT some features are limited or disabled (such as: video 
streaming)<br/><br/><b>Sensors</b><br/>Robit has a video camera in his head that can stream live video and images. He also has a led flash light to see in the dark (in his forehead). Robit
 has several ultrasonic sensors for feeling what's in front of him, And a
 9-Axis (Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass) so he knows what direction his 
moving. <br/><br/><b>Sound</b><br/>Robit has a speaker and microphone connected to a 
sound card (and not the simple on board HDMI sound) so he can do 
sophisticated sound manipulations.<div><div>
<b><br/>Eyes</b><div>Robit has 2 eyes, each has an 8X8 LED matrix.

Oh... and one more thing!








Robit technical details:
MovementRobit drives on 3 wheels: the two front ones are powered by 2 powerful DC motors and the back wheel is free. The 2 front wheels have wheel encoders that count the number of rounds so Robit knows the speed and distance of his movementHead and NeckThe head can move up and down and right to left powered by 2 servo motors. The neck moves up and down with a servo motor. The Real Time Board (Firmware)Robit
 has a built in real time board similar to an Arduino. This board 
controls the hardware directly: the motors, the sensors, etc. The board 
has an API that can be accessed, although we recommend using our hi-level
 API.Computer Board (The brain)Robit is powered 
by a single board computer (Raspberry Pi). This computer includes a 4 
quad CPU (ARM), 1 GB of RAM, and 16 GB of SSD memory for storing things 
like apps, music, etc.ConnectivityRobit connects to the home WiFi with a Wi-Fi card and an Antenna so it's always in range. Robit
 also has Bluetooth that you can use when WiFi is not available. When 
using BT some features are limited or disabled (such as: video 
streaming)SensorsRobit has a video camera in his head that can stream live video and images. He also has a led flash light to see in the dark (in his forehead). Robit
 has several ultrasonic sensors for feeling what's in front of him, And a
 9-Axis (Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass) so he knows what direction his 
moving. SoundRobit has a speaker and microphone connected to a 
sound card (and not the simple on board HDMI sound) so he can do 
sophisticated sound manipulations.
EyesRobit has 2 eyes, each has an 8X8 LED matrix. LED's could be deemed to different levels.SoftwareRobit's Operating System is Linux (Debian Based distribution). We provide a very easy to use Python and Node.js (JavaScript) API. The API libraries include: MovementEvents (sensors, sound, etc)Controlling the eyes: you can draw bitmaps, letters, animationsSound


We also provide a wider API for cool stuff:Gestures - play interesting expressions on his eyesImage Recognition - Based on OpenCV we offer a library of useful functions you can use out of the boxObject Detection and Object TrackingConnectivityLow Level APIIf you want to support other languages (C++,
 Java, etc), or write your own API we provide a low level API and

After that, it occurred to us what we can do to stop the imminent extinction of this authentic nomadic lifestyle. So, we got the idea of creating a social business, to kindle a sense of self-esteem in the nomads in a way that they continue their precious lifestyle. In other words, they do not abandon their tents for living in cities.<br/>Read more about us: <a href=""https://nomad.tours"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://nomad.tours</a><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539506515/rrlsvxpwa9r89str1veg.png"" src=""""/><br/>So, we came up with a complementary model for rural development.The decision was reached after consultation with some anthropologists and professors. see our international Team members here: <a href=""https://nomad.tours/who-we-are/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nomad.tours/who-we-are/</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539506656/lnzfpznzsd5fpbyp7tzg.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>How Do We Help to Preserve Nomadic Lifestyle?</strong></p><p>In our work model, we take a small group of responsible visitors to nomad families to live with them for some days. During these days, we accompany the nomads during their daily life, respecting their traditional culture in all its aspect and not causing any changes. We are fully committed to low impact travel that not only preserves but gives back to the amazing people and places we go. In other words, when tourists join the nomads in their daily lives, they provide the nomads with supplementary income, which is, of course, lower than the amount they earn through shepherding. So, on the one hand, the additional income would financially help them, on the other hand since it is not a large income in comparison to their owns’, they would be encouraged to keep on with their own lifestyle. Moreover, when they see how everybody is appreciative of their lifestyle, they would be encouraged to preserve it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539506735/xppvbmunjsb3tbmiv3ds.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Who Are Bakhtiari Nomads?</strong></p><p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Persian Bakhtiari nomads are a group of remaining nomad tribes in the dazzling landscapes of the Zagros Mountains.

Since a hundred years ago, the number of these authentic people has declined. Different regimes and groups have tried to stop their migration under the pretext of supporting them or making their lives easier, but in fact, these measures were attempted to patronize and thus control the Bakhtiyari, which made them lose their self-esteem. Hundred years ago, a quarter of the population were Nomads. 50 years ago the population of these people decreased and they made 10% of the whole population. Now, after years of continuing decline, there is just 1% of them, which is something around 1million</span>.<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> Fortunately, there are still thousands of them keeping the culture alive.

On the one hand, the visitors would experience something quite different from what they see in their daily lives in cities. Passing through pastoral landscapes and living the authentic life of nomads influenced by the mother nature, leave them in deep appreciation for this lifestyle, and it is going to be a turning point in their lives since they would not be the same persons when they go back to their daily routine. On the other hand, when the nomads see how their unique lifestyle is being appreciated by the visitors, they might hopefully see this as an opportunity to stay, rather than to choose to abandon a precious lifestyle. <br/>Cultural diversity and Biodiversity is of global importance and we wish to help preserve Nomadic lifestyle which is a great sample of sustainable use of Nature. this culture has so much to be learned from since it is in perfect harmony with nature. Their lifestyle, especially their migration is one of the most authentic and intimate ways humans can relate to nature and this knowledge which is gained in thousands of years can be quite helpful.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539513232/kfeyglaivf1fedb9qibj.png"" src=""""/></p><div>

After that, it occurred to us what we can do to stop the imminent extinction of this authentic nomadic lifestyle. So, we got the idea of creating a social business, to kindle a sense of self-esteem in the nomads in a way that they continue their precious lifestyle. In other words, they do not abandon their tents for living in cities.Read more about us: https://nomad.toursSo, we came up with a complementary model for rural development.The decision was reached after consultation with some anthropologists and professors. see our international Team members here: www.nomad.tours/who-we-are/How Do We Help to Preserve Nomadic Lifestyle?In our work model, we take a small group of responsible visitors to nomad families to live with them for some days. During these days, we accompany the nomads during their daily life, respecting their traditional culture in all its aspect and not causing any changes. We are fully committed to low impact travel that not only preserves but gives back to the amazing people and places we go. In other words, when tourists join the nomads in their daily lives, they provide the nomads with supplementary income, which is, of course, lower than the amount they earn through shepherding. So, on the one hand, the additional income would financially help them, on the other hand since it is not a large income in comparison to their owns’, they would be encouraged to keep on with their own lifestyle. Moreover, when they see how everybody is appreciative of their lifestyle, they would be encouraged to preserve it.Who Are Bakhtiari Nomads?Persian Bakhtiari nomads are a group of remaining nomad tribes in the dazzling landscapes of the Zagros Mountains. They are descendant of ancient Bakhtiari nomads who used to live in the area many years ago. They migrate twice a year to provide their flocks with fresh grass. Once in spring, when they move to their summer pastures, and then in fall when they move to lower altitudes. Since a hundred years ago, the number of these authentic people has declined. Different regimes and groups have tried to stop their migration under the pretext of supporting them or making their lives easier, but in fact, these measures were attempted to patronize and thus control the Bakhtiyari, which made them lose their self-esteem. Hundred years ago, a quarter of the population were Nomads. 50 years ago the population of these people decreased and they made 10% of the whole population. Now, after years of continuing decline, there is just 1% of them, which is something around 1million. Fortunately, there are still thousands of them keeping the culture alive. But they are experiencing a dramatic decline.An article published in National Geography about fading away of Nomadic lifestyle, you can get access to this article which published on October 2018 from this link. Also you can find an article to  know more about Bakhtiari people on our Weblog.What We Intend to Do?We firmly believe that the unique and memorable experience of migration with nomad families in lush green valleys and mountainous regions, which is like no other experience, have a mutual benefit for both the nomads and tourists. On the one hand, the visitors would experience something quite different from what they see in their daily lives in cities. Passing through pastoral landscapes and living the authentic life of nomads influenced by the mother nature, leave them in deep appreciation for this lifestyle, and it is going to be a turning point in their lives since they would not be the same persons when they go back to their daily routine. On the other hand, when the nomads see how their unique lifestyle is being appreciated by the visitors, they might hopefully see this as an opportunity to stay, rather than to choose to abandon a precious lifestyle. Cultural diversity and Biodiversity is of global importance and we wish to help preserve Nomadic lifestyle which is a great sample of sustainable use of Nature. this culture has so much to be learned from since it is in perfect harmony with nature. Their lifestyle, especially their migration is one of the most authentic and intimate ways humans can relate to nature and this knowledge which is gained in thousands of years can be quite helpful.
Reward Levels 
Please choose a reward level and help us make Nomads known to the world to prevent their extinction. They have a very rich history and their lifestyle is really worthwhile to maintain. The rewards are selected from Nomadic handicraft which has a broad historical background. By doing so, we wish to help protect it, and also we seek to make them and their art known to the world.What Happens During Nomads’ Seasonal Migration if You Join it? After some trekking among beautiful pastures, Nomads’ black tents are seen. We join them in almost all aspects of their unique lifestyle. We eat what they eat, we shepherd their flocks, milk the goats, bake bread. Finally, we accompany them among mountains while their sheep & goats move through pastures, grazing fresh grass.

<h3>1. Instant Side Access </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/033/877/526/23148e9117a918834120594905e85a14_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1623633693&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=b0518696c5fe6f193af033e181a62933"" src=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>Instant side access</strong> openings into the Main Compartment and the Essentials Compartment (see Feature #4) mean you can get to what your child needs fast. Side Access is super convenient when you're wearing the bag, it's adjacent to you, or it's under the seat in front of you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/034/105/980/0f3b123e1bf383564f8cfd333b0a9513_original.gif?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1625459038&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=d9b34fc85a16ceeb5f1172e663769dfd"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>But don't worry, the Main Compartment also opens from the top and front too -- so whatever you need is always just one zipper or buckle away.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. Flexible Organization System   </h3>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Customize your bag with our adjustable shelves exactly how you want them</i></p>
<p>The Getaway Bag has a flexible organization system using 2 Adjustable Shelves that velcro securely inside the Main Compartment. The shelves enable you to create 1, 2 or 3 distinct sections.

<h3>3. Odor-Resistant Emergency Compartment </h3>
<p>The Emergency Compartment contains inevitable ""messes"" that happen along the journey (think: diaper blowouts, muddy shoes, soiled clothing, wet swimsuits) and keeps them separate from the rest of your things. It's fully lined in odor-resistant, waterproof, easy-to-clean fabric. And when it's empty, the capacity simply transfers into the Main compartment so you don’t waste any space!</p>

<h2>Sustainable + Premium Materials</h2>

<li>100% Vegetable-Tanned Leather Trim</li>

<h2>Our first (small) production run is already done! </h2>
<p>We finished 14 months of product development for the Getaway and Sidekick, and have already invested a lot of time and our personal savings to complete our first small production order earlier this year of 100 units (50x Getaway Bags + 50x Sidekicks). Unlike many other crowdfunding projects, we are well beyond the prototype stage. This approach requires more upfront investment, but it enables us to have a shorter and more accurate timeline for the delivery of your packs. Also, as a backer, you don’t have to wonder if this project will even succeed -- because it already has! You can also take comfort knowing that other parents have already tested out the first small production and given us feedback below!</p> <h2>Initial Parent Feedback </h2>
<p>Using our first small production run, we have been able to gather valuable product feedback from our initial parent testers:</p>

<h2>Experienced Product Team + Factory</h2>
<p>We should also mention that producing great products is not new territory for us. Our team has years of experience in consumer goods from companies including Timbuk2, Ralph Lauren, Theory, The North Face, Banana Republic, Amour Vert, One Kings Lane and Chairish. Not only that, we’ve partnered with one of the best technical bag manufacturers in the world, behind many of the household brand names in outdoor, travel, and fashion. </p>
<p>The Vietnam-based factory we work with has been vetted extensively for workplace conditions, safety measures, and labor practices. The team’s working relationship with the factory extends past 15+ years, and we’ve worked closely with them during the design and development of this backpack. We are proud to call them both partners and friends.</p> <h2>Satisfaction Guaranteed &amp; a Lifetime Warranty</h2>
<p>We are so confident you’ll love the Getaway Bag and the Sidekick that we guarantee that you will. When you receive your bag(s), if you’re not 100% satisfied with the quality, simply send it back within 2 weeks of receipt for a full refund of the purchase price (shipping and handling fees are non-refundable). We’re pretty sure you’ll be more excited to plan a trip with your family, than return it though!</p> <p>For our Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers only, we will also stand behind all our bags with a lifetime guarantee. This covers manufacturing defects and excessive damage occurring during normal use. Normal wear and tear from everyday use is not covered. We hope your bag is perfect, but if you notice a problem, just let us know and we will work with you to make things right.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing the Getaway Bag: A 360-Degree View
What fits?
 
A home for every item you need to bring for your next family adventure (see the ""Packing Guide"" below for the full list of items shown here!)
The travel backpack every parent needs.
We are No Reception Club, a small but mighty travel essentials startup, founded by two parents (Gemma + Daniel) who absolutely love family travel, but grew extremely frustrated by the limited products available to make it easier. Our mission is to inspire parents to unplug and go on adventures with their little ones. We do this by creating intelligently and elegantly designed bags to make it easier to go on every kind of family adventure -- from Saturday ""daycations"", to overnight staycations, to week-long vacations!
 
Our first two products: the Getaway Bag and the Sidekick
Our first product is the Getaway Bag, a travel backpack so organized that parents can use it with their eyes closed, and while balancing a little one on their hip. We pushed the boundaries of organization, accessibility, versatility, and capacity in ways never seen before in a diaper bag, and without compromising on style or comfort. Our second product is the Sidekick, a hip pack that helps you breeze through diaper changes on-the-go, with a special pocket that allows you to retrieve diaper wipes one-handed.  
 
Introducing the Sidekick. Breeze through diaper changes with one-handed access to diaper wipes!
 
 
 

Stop digging aimlessly to find that one item.
Traveling with a baby or toddler (or both!) can be pretty difficult, particularly when you aren't properly equipped for the journey. The Getaway Bag is packed with intelligent features to simplify every part of traveling with your little one(s). Fit and organize everything you need to get your child and you to your destination.  Access exactly the item that will end the tantrum ASAP, and one-handed. Contain casualties from diaper blowouts and spills with aplomb. Glide through airport security stress-free. And on top of all that, feel good knowing that your bag is made from durable recycled materials. Yes, we thought of everything.
 
Top Feature Highlights
 
Features Deep Dive
 
 
1. Instant Side Access 
 
Instant side access openings into the Main Compartment and the Essentials Compartment (see Feature #4) mean you can get to what your child needs fast. Side Access is super convenient when you're wearing the bag, it's adjacent to you, or it's under the seat in front of you. 
 
But don't worry, the Main Compartment also opens from the top and front too -- so whatever you need is always just one zipper or buckle away.
 
2. Flexible Organization System   
 
Customize your bag with our adjustable shelves exactly how you want them
The Getaway Bag has a flexible organization system using 2 Adjustable Shelves that velcro securely inside the Main Compartment. The shelves enable you to create 1, 2 or 3 distinct sections. Because packing needs change based on your trip, your growing child, and your growing family, the flexible shelves help you adapt the Getaway Bag to your evolving organizational needs.  
 
The backpack that grows with your family
 

3. Odor-Resistant Emergency Compartment 
The Emergency Compartment contains inevitable ""messes"" that happen along the journey (think: diaper blowouts, muddy shoes, soiled clothing, wet swimsuits) and keeps them separate from the rest of your things. It's fully lined in odor-resistant, waterproof, easy-to-clean fabric. And when it's empty, the capacity simply transfers into the Main compartment so you don’t waste any space!
 
4. Essentials Compartment for critical items
 
The Essentials Compartment keeps all your diaper changing essentials (or other critical items once your little one is out of diapers) instantly accessible. It is spacious enough to fit multiple diapers, a changing pad, diaper wipes, and cream -- and is 100% compatible with the Sidekick, making this an unbeatable travel system for parents.
 
5. Parent Pockets for your things 
 
 
Front Parent Pocket for your small travel essentials (hand sanitizer, masks, tickets, travel guides)
 
TSA-Approved Laptop Sleeve for your tech (laptop, tablets, chargers)

Top/Hood Parent Pocket for your day-to-day essentials.
Front Parent Pocket for small travel essentials. Includes key clip.
TSA-Approved Laptop Sleeve fits up to a 16"" Laptop, tablets, magazines. The clamshell design means you can avoid removing your laptop when going through TSA airport security.

 
6. Insulated Lunch Bag (included) 
 
Ships with an insulated Lunch Bag lined with EVA foam to keep your little one's food or liquids cool or warm for multiple hours. Fits all common milk bottles. Easily remove the lunch bag at mealtimes or security checkpoints for screening. The lunch bag measures 8"" H x 6"" W x 3.75"" D. 
7. Stroller Straps (included)   
Ships with 2 Stroller Straps that attach easily to stroller handles.
 
8. Exterior Water Bottle Pockets 
 
Stay hydrated throughout the journey with 2 expandable Exterior Water Bottle Pockets - one for you, one for your little one.
 
9. Luggage Handle Pass-through 
A Luggage Handle Pass-through slides conveniently over luggage handles to help you move swiftly with multiple bags.

10. Security/Passports Pocket 
 
A concealed Security/Passports Pocket is hidden discreetly behind the Luggage Pass-through, and is ideal for storing passports, cash, and other small valuables.
 
11. Detachable Sternum Strap (sold separately)
 
For longer adventures, we have a detachable sternum strap add-on that can be easily attached (snap-on, snap-off) to the shoulder straps on the Getaway Bag for increased support. 

 
Optimal Fit for Different Body Types
 
The Getaway Bag's Shoulder Straps and Quilted Back Panel design maximize flexibility and comfort on a wide range of body types, making it easy to switch between parents of different sizes.

Sustainable + Premium Materials

100% Vegetable-Tanned Leather Trim
61% Recycled Polyester + 39% Nylon Interior Lining

Packaging: Our polybag shipper is 100% recyclable and is made of 100% pre-consumer recycled content. We reduced packaging by combining the polybag and shipper envelope, typically two separate pieces, into one.  

 
 
 
Whether you’re in an aircraft lavatory, the backseat of a car, or the corner of a public restroom -- changing a diaper in tight quarters and on-the-go is challenging. Wear the Sidekick to keep your hands fully available to hold onto your little one and grab wipes one-handed, so you can complete that diaper change ASAP. 

 
Features Deep Dive
1. Retrieve Diaper Wipes One-Handed. 
 
The Sidekick’s back pocket is designed to hold a pack of diaper wipes, with a magnetic closure that enables you to quickly access wipes with just one hand… freeing your other hand to stop your little one from escaping!
 
2. Fits all Diaper Changing Essentials 
 
The Sidekick comfortably fits 4-6x diapers (depending on the diaper size), 1x diaper cream, 1x hand sanitizer, and 1x changing pad (included). The interior slip pocket holds a couple day-to-day essentials (e.g. phone, keys, credit card), while keeping them separated from your diaper items.
 
3.  Changing Pad (included) 
 
Ships with a soft, padded Changing Pad that folds up compactly when not in use. Water-resistant, easily cleaned fabric that is also entirely machine washable (lay flat to dry).

The Complete Backpack
 
Packing for you and your little one(s) can be a challenge, but do not worry as the Getaway Bag has you covered. Here's our packing guide for a newborn: 
 
The Main Compartment: 3 Ways to Pack

Our first (small) production run is already done! 
We finished 14 months of product development for the Getaway and Sidekick, and have already invested a lot of time and our personal savings to complete our first small production order earlier this year of 100 units (50x Getaway Bags + 50x Sidekicks). Unlike many other crowdfunding projects, we are well beyond the prototype stage. This approach requires more upfront investment, but it enables us to have a shorter and more accurate timeline for the delivery of your packs. Also, as a backer, you don’t have to wonder if this project will even succeed -- because it already has! You can also take comfort knowing that other parents have already tested out the first small production and given us feedback below! Initial Parent Feedback 
Using our first small production run, we have been able to gather valuable product feedback from our initial parent testers:
The Getaway Bag
 
The Sidekick
 
 
Experienced Product Team + Factory
We should also mention that producing great products is not new territory for us. Our team has years of experience in consumer goods from companies including Timbuk2, Ralph Lauren, Theory, The North Face, Banana Republic, Amour Vert, One Kings Lane and Chairish. Not only that, we’ve partnered with one of the best technical bag manufacturers in the world, behind many of the household brand names in outdoor, travel, and fashion. 
The Vietnam-based factory we work with has been vetted extensively for workplace conditions, safety measures, and labor practices. The team’s working relationship with the factory extends past 15+ years, and we’ve worked closely with them during the design and development of this backpack. We are proud to call them both partners and friends. Satisfaction Guaranteed & a Lifetime Warranty
We are so confident you’ll love the Getaway Bag and the Sidekick that we guarantee that you will. When you receive your bag(s), if you’re not 100% satisfied with the quality, simply send it back within 2 weeks of receipt for a full refund of the purchase price (shipping and handling fees are non-refundable). We’re pretty sure you’ll be more excited to plan a trip with your family, than return it though! For our Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers only, we will also stand behind all our bags with a lifetime guarantee. This covers manufacturing defects and excessive damage occurring during normal use. Normal wear and tear from everyday use is not covered. We hope your bag is perfect, but if you notice a problem, just let us know and we will work with you to make things right.

<div><p>We came to the island 3 years ago, chasing a dream of finding a place to raise our future family. We fell for the magic of Pelee Island and found The Nest. The Nest offers lakefront views, bird watching, disc golf, cannabis cultivation, permaculture living, social events, nature hikes, glamping accommodations, a tiny house community and 3.5 acres of serenity. While at The Nest you can find yourself in the middle of the forest or on the water's edge. Imagine being surrounded by monarchs, waking up to the chatter of bird life, casting a line into Lake Erie to catch a prehistoric sturgeon and ending your day by sampling the fruit of the land while stargazing - all from our southern escape. </p></div>
<p>We intend to offer a unique experience that can only be discovered on Pelee Island. Come and explore Ontario's best kept secret at Canada's most southern inhabited island.</p>

<p><strong>WHY DID WE DECIDE TO NEST HERE?</strong></p>
<p>After listing our 1000 sq. ft. house in Brampton, Ontario, we were looking for the perfect place to raise a family, that would provide waterfront, boat access, permaculture living, large trees, community and the best growing environment where we could host friends and strangers. After countless hours of searching online and many frustrations, we finally found The Nest. We got on a ferry the next day, and after a 3.5 hour drive plus a 1.5 hr ferry ride, we arrived with a stern warning that our adventurousness may result in us not leaving the island the same day and having to possibly sleep in our Smart car. As we drove the island, we met many soon-to-be familiar faces and felt the embrace of the community in what we found out later is not the typical time to visit the island.  We also saw many things that day, including; amazing countryside, birds and some of the best beaches. But one area on the island stood out to us in particular - the South Shore. The idea of The Nest had already started at this point, and it was only going to be a matter of time until we would finally be there for good.</p>

</div></div>","We came to the island 3 years ago, chasing a dream of finding a place to raise our future family. We fell for the magic of Pelee Island and found The Nest. The Nest offers lakefront views, bird watching, disc golf, cannabis cultivation, permaculture living, social events, nature hikes, glamping accommodations, a tiny house community and 3.5 acres of serenity. While at The Nest you can find yourself in the middle of the forest or on the water's edge. Imagine being surrounded by monarchs, waking up to the chatter of bird life, casting a line into Lake Erie to catch a prehistoric sturgeon and ending your day by sampling the fruit of the land while stargazing - all from our southern escape. 
We intend to offer a unique experience that can only be discovered on Pelee Island. Come and explore Ontario's best kept secret at Canada's most southern inhabited island.

Melissa is an avid sewer/quilter, paper artist, writer, interpreter, entrepreneur, sailor, knitted sweater lover, rock-tumbling, sheet-tucking, forehead-kissing wife & mom. She believes in doing what's right, comfy beds, cozy slippers, locally-grown organic food and the odd glass of Pelee Island wine.
Roles:

Creature comfort specialist
BnB management
Quality control/food & beverage specialist
Maintenance & cleaning
Social media representative


Justin can be found sailing Wind Dreamer, flying drones, in the kitchen, tending to the garden (Gramly Farm), building something, fixing something or dreaming up the next big project. He stands for good hard work, quality service, organic food, sustainable living, craft beer and all things tiny living.
Roles:

Building-related projects

WHY DID WE DECIDE TO NEST HERE?
After listing our 1000 sq. ft. house in Brampton, Ontario, we were looking for the perfect place to raise a family, that would provide waterfront, boat access, permaculture living, large trees, community and the best growing environment where we could host friends and strangers. After countless hours of searching online and many frustrations, we finally found The Nest. We got on a ferry the next day, and after a 3.5 hour drive plus a 1.5 hr ferry ride, we arrived with a stern warning that our adventurousness may result in us not leaving the island the same day and having to possibly sleep in our Smart car. As we drove the island, we met many soon-to-be familiar faces and felt the embrace of the community in what we found out later is not the typical time to visit the island.  We also saw many things that day, including; amazing countryside, birds and some of the best beaches. But one area on the island stood out to us in particular - the South Shore. The idea of The Nest had already started at this point, and it was only going to be a matter of time until we would finally be there for good.

WE NEED YOUR HELP
We have invested in the purchase of the property, 3 years of endless work trips, discovery and exploration. Now we ask for you to invest your vacation with us, your time, second hand items or just good vibes. We will keep doing what we have always done - make handmade items, share our journey and celebrate as each project comes to an end with food and drinks. Come be a part of the beginning of a growing community. Maybe you'll even decide to come back once in a while to see the latest project, because we have no intention of stopping anytime soon.

<h2> What's New</h2>

<strong>UPGRADED FILL:</strong> Nano-Coated Down for Water Resistance</li>

<strong>ENHANCED SHELL: </strong>Windproof &amp; Water-Resistant Nylon</li>

<p><strong>Why Invest in a Down Beanie?</strong></p>
<p>Our heads are up to 5x more sensitive to temperature changes compared to other parts of our body. Therefore, it's essential to keep it warm and protected in cold climates. </p>
<p>We've long used knit beanies, but they tend to be itchy, inconvenient to pack away, and susceptible to strong winds. </p>
<p>Often we forget them at home because they're relatively bulky and don't fit into our pockets or take too much space in a purse.</p>
<p>Our previous project to address these issues, the Tatsu, became the most backed beanie on Crowdfunding history ever. After delivering thousands of pieces in the past year, we've learned a lot from the feedback we've received. And by tweaking and tinkering with new ideas, materials, and manufacturers, we're now ready to introduce the result.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582138612/zwjap5czs3vnrqc1eqdg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>MEET AIR,</h2>
<h3>FÜRST's Improved Down Beanie </h3>
<p>Think of it like an ultra-lightweight, extremely warm down jacket for your head.</p>
<p>With the Air, we strove to provide a more comfortable fit while introducing nano-coated, water-resistant down for even more weather resistance.</p>
<p>The pattern is inspired by Japanese designs, and we've incorporated advanced materials and construction techniques to produce an even higher performance product.</p>
<p>What hasn't changed is our commitment to help under-served youth discover the outdoors and become future stewards of our environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582139706/bwyukiputho3kc8ogxbg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We're continuing to only use <strong>RDS-Certified</strong> (Responsible Down Standard) goose down that has been independently verified to ensure cruelty-free treatment of the animal.</p>
<p>Our <strong>700 Fill Power</strong> <strong>Goose Down</strong> is rated higher (which means it's warmer and lighter) than certain recognized brands' jackets, and this grade of down feather can only be found in larger, more mature animals. This premium FP offers an incredible combination of warmth and packability. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582139746/kgxazqvwpup8hpn89dpr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>FÜRST's specially treated down features a <strong>Permanently-Bonded Water-Resistant Coating</strong>. This nano coating enhances the natural hydrophobic nature of goose down to ensure additional protection against the elements.</p>
<p><strong>Down is one of best insulators known to man</strong>. High quality goose down offers unparalleled versatility and comfort across a wide temperature spectrum. Compared to other beanies you might own, you'll stay warmer at lower temperatures, and it'll weigh a lot less too!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582139871/uhf0gxp7tolglldwor8c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our ultra-fine <strong>20 denier nylon</strong> is made of a tight weave of silky soft fabric that naturally blocks the wind and provides strong <strong>protection against water</strong>. It’s also the perfect balance between durability and lightweight protection, allowing the down to loft to its maximum potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582139922/qawkibzhitgruyhe26th.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even as the weather warms up, or as you engage in strenuous activity, <strong>you'll stay comfortable longer</strong> without having to remove and store your beanie. The Air Beanie is <strong>breathable </strong>thanks to microscopic perforations in the material small enough to resist liquid water droplets, yet large enough to vent water vapor (your sweat moisture) for it to escape</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582139976/bjr4gvlrsrpgxpidfdbe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Air beanie is also lined with a moisture wicking sweatband that <strong>keeps your head dry longer</strong> even if you work up a sweat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582140076/x5bleu556eefpthd7elb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Weighing in at just 1 oz (29 grams)</strong>, the Air beanie can practically vanish as it’s able to compress down to roughly the size of a golf ball. Once it's no longer needed, you can easily stow it away in a pocket or to your purse. This makes it perfect for everyday carry, so you always have it available on hand.</p>

<p>When properly cared for, your FÜRST Air Beanie can last for decades. Periodic cleaning will help your down beanie last longer and perform at its best.</p>
<p><strong>Machine-wash</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Machine-wash on a gentle cycle at 82 °F (28 °C). If available, select the ‘extra rinse’ option. Use a down-specific soap or detergent, like Nikwax Down Wash.</li>
<li>Skip the spin cycle. It’s better for your beanie to drip dry and/or use a tumble dryer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand-wash</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soak your beanie for up to 60 minutes. Again, go for a down-specific detergent. </li>
<li>Rinse by lightly squeezing out excess water (don’t wring it!) and follow the drying steps below.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drying</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the wash is complete, carefully remove your beanie and lay it flat on a rack to dry. As you do this, gently fluff up the down filling.</li>
<li>It may take up to 24/48 hours to drip dry depending on ambient conditions. As it dries, continue to occasionally fluff it.</li>
<li>When almost dry, put it in a tumble drier on the lowest heat settings and check it regularly to prevent overheating. To maximize the loft of your Air Beanie, throw in two to three clean tennis balls to help fluff it up further.</li>
</ul>
<p>Down is a tough performer against the cold, but when thoroughly soaked (even with the Air's nano-coating), it'll require a little extra attention to ensure it doesn’t get damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Things to Avoid:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fabric softener. Stick to a down-specific detergent for the best results.</li>
<li>Dish washing detergent. It will strip the natural fats and oils found in down that prevents it from clumping together and that provides its incredible loft.</li>
<li>Dry cleaning. The solvents used in some dry cleaning processes can damage your beanie.</li>
<li>A top loader with an agitator. It’s a rougher wash, and your versatile beanie deserves a gentle hand.</li>
<li>The spin cycle. Down is heavy when it’s wet, so err on the side of caution to avoid damage.</li>
<li>Wringing. Don’t wring your beanie, no matter how heavy it is. If you must, gently shake any excess water off while supporting its weight and squeeze out excess water.</li>

</div></div>","FÜRST's Air Beanie is the NEWLY IMPROVED version of last year's Tatsu Down Beanie. Thousands of people like you made that the MOST POPULAR beanie in Kickstarter history!
This is the WARMEST and most VERSATILE beanie that you will ever wear - with even more features and abilities!

 
Packs to the size of a golf ball (stuff sack will be included)

 What's New


UPGRADED FILL: Nano-Coated Down for Water Resistance

ENHANCED SHELL: Windproof & Water-Resistant Nylon

STREAMLINED SHAPE: Sportier Form-Factor, Glove-Like Fit

IMPROVED COMFORT: Moisture Wicking, More Breathable


Why Invest in a Down Beanie?
Our heads are up to 5x more sensitive to temperature changes compared to other parts of our body. Therefore, it's essential to keep it warm and protected in cold climates. 
We've long used knit beanies, but they tend to be itchy, inconvenient to pack away, and susceptible to strong winds. 
Often we forget them at home because they're relatively bulky and don't fit into our pockets or take too much space in a purse.
Our previous project to address these issues, the Tatsu, became the most backed beanie on Crowdfunding history ever. After delivering thousands of pieces in the past year, we've learned a lot from the feedback we've received. And by tweaking and tinkering with new ideas, materials, and manufacturers, we're now ready to introduce the result.

MEET AIR,
FÜRST's Improved Down Beanie 
Think of it like an ultra-lightweight, extremely warm down jacket for your head.
With the Air, we strove to provide a more comfortable fit while introducing nano-coated, water-resistant down for even more weather resistance.
The pattern is inspired by Japanese designs, and we've incorporated advanced materials and construction techniques to produce an even higher performance product.
What hasn't changed is our commitment to help under-served youth discover the outdoors and become future stewards of our environment.
 

We're continuing to only use RDS-Certified (Responsible Down Standard) goose down that has been independently verified to ensure cruelty-free treatment of the animal.
Our 700 Fill Power Goose Down is rated higher (which means it's warmer and lighter) than certain recognized brands' jackets, and this grade of down feather can only be found in larger, more mature animals. This premium FP offers an incredible combination of warmth and packability. 

FÜRST's specially treated down features a Permanently-Bonded Water-Resistant Coating. This nano coating enhances the natural hydrophobic nature of goose down to ensure additional protection against the elements.
Down is one of best insulators known to man. High quality goose down offers unparalleled versatility and comfort across a wide temperature spectrum. Compared to other beanies you might own, you'll stay warmer at lower temperatures, and it'll weigh a lot less too!

Our ultra-fine 20 denier nylon is made of a tight weave of silky soft fabric that naturally blocks the wind and provides strong protection against water. It’s also the perfect balance between durability and lightweight protection, allowing the down to loft to its maximum potential.
 

Even as the weather warms up, or as you engage in strenuous activity, you'll stay comfortable longer without having to remove and store your beanie. The Air Beanie is breathable thanks to microscopic perforations in the material small enough to resist liquid water droplets, yet large enough to vent water vapor (your sweat moisture) for it to escape

The Air beanie is also lined with a moisture wicking sweatband that keeps your head dry longer even if you work up a sweat. 
 

Weighing in at just 1 oz (29 grams), the Air beanie can practically vanish as it’s able to compress down to roughly the size of a golf ball. Once it's no longer needed, you can easily stow it away in a pocket or to your purse. This makes it perfect for everyday carry, so you always have it available on hand.

It may take up to 24/48 hours to drip dry depending on ambient conditions. As it dries, continue to occasionally fluff it.
When almost dry, put it in a tumble drier on the lowest heat settings and check it regularly to prevent overheating. To maximize the loft of your Air Beanie, throw in two to three clean tennis balls to help fluff it up further.

<h3>What is Baja Glamping?</h3>
<p>My name is Frances Valadez, I am the owner and one of the hosts of Baja Glamping along with my mother, sister and brother. We are all originally from San Diego, California but now I reside full time on the property as a dual citizen.</p>
<p>In the early 90s my father came upon Mulege with his brother on a road trip and instantly fell in love with the town, scenery and the people(how could you not?), once I came into the world we began coming down every summer and winter break. It started with tents at Playa Coyote then it evolved into our 1970s renovated airstream in between the famous palms on Coyote then in 2004 he bought what is now Baja Glamping. </p>
<p>In 2016 our beloved Papa passed due to Cancer so we decided to take over the land and finish what he had started. Although people have stayed with us off and on over the years, we established Baja Glamping officially 1 year ago and are working very hard to make it the best it can be. We have two indoor spaces available for rent, camping plots, a disc golf course, and loads of ocean equipment like SUPs, snorkeling gear, spears, and Kayaks.</p>
<p>We appreciate all of our guests, friends, and family who have visited and helped us through the years to create our beautiful home. We look forward to the future and what we will become and hope to shed some light on the magical town we are fortunate enough to call our home.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the last few years, we had many friends and family offer to help us out but we weren't quite sure what we needed, and what the best way to go about that would be so we decided to wait for a clear vision in order to best use our resources and your generosity. </p>
<p>After living and working on the property over the last year we have a clear vision of what we would like to accomplish and have already begun work on a few things, but would love to accomplish a few more before next summer-which is where you come in. We don't want to ask for only your charity, so we would like to offer advanced and discounted pricing on our new accommodations as well as a chance to experience some awesome activities and visit the lovely Bahia De Concepcion. </p>
<p><strong>Some of the things we are already working on</strong></p>
<p>- Digging out and refurbishing our 30-year-old well along with adding a pump so we can water our plants consistently and completely sustainably. </p>
<p>-Refurbishing our two existing rooms including new handmade wooden decks with welded metal framing and a shaded hangout area.</p>
<p>- Remodeling our old Adobe house to add another room.</p>
<p>- Building a new shower, bathroom, and kitchen area. </p>
<p>-Leveling and grading a tent camping zone.</p>
<p><strong>What we would like to start with your help.</strong></p>
<p>- Greywater system to maximize the usage we get out of our shower and kitchen water.</p>
<p>- Small ranch/orchard so our guests can have fresh milk, eggs, and made right in their backyard. </p>
<p>-2 new yurts for added Outdoor Camping.</p>
<p>- A new gate and tree/fence around the property for added privacy and shade</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will you be helping our family and dream, but also the local community in Mulege.  As with any area that relies on tourism the past 2 years have been tough for local artisans, fishermen, ranchers, and many other workers. Our business along with many others like Mulege Brewing Co, Pollo Berthas, JC's restaurant, Boneys Restaurant, El Candil, Estrella Del Mar, and many many others bring much-needed foot traffic to this area. </p>
<p>All construction, farming, and equipment(that can be) will be purchased locally and completed by workers who live in Mulege.  5%percent of all money raised will be donated to a local orphanage ""Casa Hogar El Altisimo"" that our family knows does amazing work with local kids.  If you would like more info on them please feel free to contact us directly. </p>
<p>As Airbnb super hosts we are well versed in providing an experience guests can enjoy, and would like your help to create an even better one. </p>

<p></p><b>Pet Stems </b>is the world’s first orally administered nutritional cell therapy products designed to enhance and extend the quality of life for sick or aging pets.<div>
<br/><div>
<p><strong>What is Pet Stems?</strong></p>
<p><b>Pet Stems </b>is formulated to treat damaged cells of diseased or aging organs (cells that are not functioning properly) and revitalizes “dormant” cells where needed. <b>Pet Stems</b> uses “healing cells” (the body’s internal medicine cabinet) to direct stem cells and crucial growth factors to repair, regenerate, and restore damaged cells and organs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1303536/files/20150317153220-red_and_white_box_shot.png?1426631540"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Pet Stems</b> will provide pet owners with safe and effective cellular products and relevant information that is based upon sound research, science, and clinical applications.</p>
<p>When our companion animals become ill, their cells and growth factors may not be able to heal or repair damaged tissues effectively. We have formulated <b>Pet Stems</b> to help improve the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal and premature aging issues</li>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Heart Disease</li>
<li>Insulin Dependency</li>
<li>Joint Degeneration</li>
<li>Kidney &amp; Liver Disease</li>
<li>Non-healing Wounds</li>
<li>Stomach Disorders</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies indicate that <b>Pet Stems</b> can boost stressed cells of diseased organs and revitalize ""dormant"" cells where needed.</p>
<p><b>Pet Stems is:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>100% organic</li>
<li>100% gluten free</li>
<li>100% safe</li>
<li>Administered Orally- Non Invasive- Requires no surgery</li>
<li>Restores youthfulness- Boosts the Immune system</li>
<li>Treats ailments by helping to heal damaged cells and tissues</li>
<li>No Doctor required- as easy as giving your pet a daily treat</li>
<li>Very affordable alternative to traditional cell therapy surgery</li>
</ul>

<b>A Pet Stems Story, Chip and His Dog Forrest</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>
</b><p>Chip is a firefighter that works for the National Forest Service.  He
and his wife have a young son named Jack and an Australian Shepherd, Corgie mix,
named Forrest.  Forrest always went out on patrol with Chip and, when at
home, helped ride herd on young Jack, and even kept Jack from walking into the
street a few times when the tyke had escaped the back yard.  But Forrest
developed severe skin hot spots and the constant trips to the vet was a major
drain on the young couple’s financial reserves.  Nothing seemed to work,
but there was no question that Chip was going to continue doing everything he
could to help Forrest.  </p>
<p>The vet wanted to adopt an ever aggressive regimen that
would provide needed relief to Forrest, but was only temporary, would cost a
lot of money, and would likely shorten Forrest’s life.  This was a
Hobson’s choice that nobody wants to go through.  But when you have a pet
that you love, that deserves your loyalty after all of the loyalty they have
given you, you want to do anything you can.  This is a family member and
you do what has to be done.  Unfortunately, the course of treatment
prescribed by the vet was just not in the young family’s budget.</p>
<p>In doing a little research, Chip found Pet Stems and
opted to try a different option that was far less expensive and much easier to
administer at home instead of at the vet. Although this was a new type of
treatment, they tried it and within a few weeks, the hot spots started to
disappear.</p>
<p>Thanks to Pet Stems, Forrest doesn’t have to go on the life
shortening steroid regimen any more.  He’s back on happy patrol with Chip
and is making sure that Jack stays safe!</p>

<h3>Stem Cells and Why they are Important</h3>
<p>Stem Cells are ""healing cells"". They have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types. They serve as an internal repair system, dividing as needed to replace diseased or damaged cells. When a stem cell divides, each new cell either becomes a different type of cell with specialized functions, such as liver cell, cartilage cell, nerve cell, or can remain a stem cell.</p>
<p>Stem cells are distinguished from other cell types by two important characteristics. First, they are unspecialized cells capable of renewing themselves. Second, they can become tissue or organ-specific cells with special functions. In some organs, such as the intestines and bone marrow, stem cells regularly divide, repairing or replacing worn out or damaged cells. In other organs, such as the pancreas and the heart, stem cells only divide under special conditions.</p>
<h3>Growth Factors and their Importance</h3>Genes found within all tissue cells (brain, liver, kidney, heart, etc.), are coded with cell specific chemicals called peptides. These peptides, also referred to as ""Growth Factors,"" are necessary for rapid cell repair and reconstruction after injury or illness. A remarkable benefit is that the Growth Factors of different species are so similar that they can be used between all species. The ""Growth Factors"" from sheep and pigs can stimulate the Stem Cells within your dog to assist in their healing processes. When your dog's body is injured by poisons, toxins, bacteria, viruses, &amp; parasite infections, the necessary Peptides or ""Growth Factors"" in an aging body may not be available in adequate quantities to heal damaged organs. The symptoms of this cellular damage may be a dog with decreased energy, slower wound healing, depression, decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br/>

<h3>Pet Stem Nutritional Stem Cell Therapy and Restoration</h3>
<p>Stem cells have the ability to self-renew and multiply resulting in new generations. These new generations can potentially replace diseased and damaged organs in your Dog. By healing damaged cells, the result can be a ""reversal of and restoration of the anti-aging process."" As we age, cells become old and can no longer replace themselves with healthy cells. Cell therapy works at the cellular level to induce cells to reproduce. The goal is to repair or replace damaged cells with new cells.</p>
<p>The implications for a rapid and full recovery from everything from broken bones to liver and kidney disease are enormous. We now have the potential to create healing where previously there was no hope of recovery.</p>

<h3>How is Pet Stems different?</h3>
<p>Presently, no other company in the world offers convenient and affordable ""At Home"" nutritional stem cell therapy for Pets. Companies that do offer stem cell therapy require a licensed veterinarian to surgically remove fat tissue from the Pet. After several weeks of processing, the Pet's isolated stem cells are returned to the veterinarian for re-implantation back into the Pet. This procedure is time consuming, expensive, invasive, and requires an approved veterinarian before and after the therapy.</p>
<p>Pet Stems does not require a veterinarian to put our Pet to sleep and surgically remove fat tissue, nor later require a veterinarian to implant the processed stem cells back into your Pet.</p>
<p>Pet Stems is simple and proven to be effective.</p>

</div></div>","Pet Stems is the world’s first orally administered nutritional cell therapy products designed to enhance and extend the quality of life for sick or aging pets.

What is Pet Stems?
Pet Stems is formulated to treat damaged cells of diseased or aging organs (cells that are not functioning properly) and revitalizes “dormant” cells where needed. Pet Stems uses “healing cells” (the body’s internal medicine cabinet) to direct stem cells and crucial growth factors to repair, regenerate, and restore damaged cells and organs.



Pet Stems will provide pet owners with safe and effective cellular products and relevant information that is based upon sound research, science, and clinical applications.
When our companion animals become ill, their cells and growth factors may not be able to heal or repair damaged tissues effectively. We have formulated Pet Stems to help improve the following conditions:

Normal and premature aging issues
Allergies
Heart Disease
Insulin Dependency
Joint Degeneration
Kidney & Liver Disease
Non-healing Wounds
Stomach Disorders

Studies indicate that Pet Stems can boost stressed cells of diseased organs and revitalize ""dormant"" cells where needed.
Pet Stems is:

100% organic
100% gluten free
100% safe
Administered Orally- Non Invasive- Requires no surgery
Restores youthfulness- Boosts the Immune system
Treats ailments by helping to heal damaged cells and tissues
No Doctor required- as easy as giving your pet a daily treat
Very affordable alternative to traditional cell therapy surgery




For more information, you can visit our website (www.petstems.com).
What's really important, is that Pet
Stems is 100% safe and was specifically designed to help restore and strengthen your Pet's damaged cells and tissues.
How are the funds raised going to be used?
The product has been developed and tested in our laboratories. Now we are raising money to get the product produced and distributed so pets everywhere can have access to cell therapy in order to improve their lives.

Pet Stems Fresh Start Kits

The Pet Stems Fresh Start Kit is a once a day orally administered chewable tablet or sublingual gel that the animal will take for a period of three months. Once the first three month’s phase is complete, we recommend that the pet takes one tablet or gel packet per week for a period of 9 months. This is our Maintenance Kit.
Supporting Service Dogs for Veterans and Those with Special Needs 
Pet Stems works with the trainers of Service Dogs for veterans and those with special needs and will provide its cell therapy product for aging service dogs who help people fulfill tasks in their daily lives. These service dogs are highly trained members of the community and Pet Stems will donate cell therapy products to these remarkable animals. This will help keep them healthy and enable them to live longer, healthier lives. Those that buy Pet Stems for their Pets will be helping service dogs in communities around the world.

A Pet Stems Story, Chip and His Dog Forrest



Chip is a firefighter that works for the National Forest Service.  He
and his wife have a young son named Jack and an Australian Shepherd, Corgie mix,
named Forrest.  Forrest always went out on patrol with Chip and, when at
home, helped ride herd on young Jack, and even kept Jack from walking into the
street a few times when the tyke had escaped the back yard.  But Forrest
developed severe skin hot spots and the constant trips to the vet was a major
drain on the young couple’s financial reserves.  Nothing seemed to work,
but there was no question that Chip was going to continue doing everything he
could to help Forrest.  
The vet wanted to adopt an ever aggressive regimen that
would provide needed relief to Forrest, but was only temporary, would cost a
lot of money, and would likely shorten Forrest’s life.  This was a
Hobson’s choice that nobody wants to go through.  But when you have a pet
that you love, that deserves your loyalty after all of the loyalty they have
given you, you want to do anything you can.  This is a family member and
you do what has to be done.  Unfortunately, the course of treatment
prescribed by the vet was just not in the young family’s budget.
In doing a little research, Chip found Pet Stems and
opted to try a different option that was far less expensive and much easier to
administer at home instead of at the vet. Although this was a new type of
treatment, they tried it and within a few weeks, the hot spots started to
disappear.
Thanks to Pet Stems, Forrest doesn’t have to go on the life
shortening steroid regimen any more.  He’s back on happy patrol with Chip
and is making sure that Jack stays safe!

globe, who  never wants to stop. I
discovered my passion for bicycle touring in 2011 after going on my first bike
tour from Bosnia-Herzegovina to the island Šolta in Croatia. This amazing
experience encouraged me to start a cycling world tour. On my first world tour
trip in 2012, I went from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Morocco, riding 4700 kilometers
in 72 days through Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, France and Spain, where I
finally crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and entered Morocco. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLoIIzmDVAbrSe438_UveG85zj-HfKi0mU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMUbB6X26ssk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be%26list%3DPLoIIzmDVAbrSe438_UveG85zj-HfKi0mU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMUbB6X26ssk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Two years later, I
decided to continue the journey by traveling from Bosnia to Uzbekistan. This
5400-kilometer trip in 2014 was an unforgettable, life-changing experience,
meeting new cultures and people not only willing to share their foods and beds,
but also their life stories and experiences with a stranger who soon
became a friend. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458677767/nswfbvqypgcrei3bwzz9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A few

globe, who  never wants to stop. I
discovered my passion for bicycle touring in 2011 after going on my first bike
tour from Bosnia-Herzegovina to the island Šolta in Croatia. This amazing
experience encouraged me to start a cycling world tour. On my first world tour
trip in 2012, I went from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Morocco, riding 4700 kilometers
in 72 days through Croatia, Slovenia, Italy, France and Spain, where I
finally crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and entered Morocco. Two years later, I
decided to continue the journey by traveling from Bosnia to Uzbekistan. This
5400-kilometer trip in 2014 was an unforgettable, life-changing experience,
meeting new cultures and people not only willing to share their foods and beds,
but also their life stories and experiences with a stranger who soon
became a friend. A few
kilograms lighter and more than a few experiences richer, I will continue my
world tour in 2016 by traveling from Tajikistan through Kyrgyzstan, India,
Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, China and South Korea to my final
destination, Japan. This will be my most challenging experience so far taking
me on a 13000-kilometer trip over 7 months.Goals: My goal is to
promote cycling as a cheap and clean means of transport and motivate others to
do the same in a time when pollution and global warming are becoming serious
issues that affect us all! 
Also my dream
is to see a world without borders, barriers and exclusion. This is why I want
to raise money for an awesome NGO in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Novi Val, that gathers
children and youth from divided cities and entities to come together for sports
and learning about ecology. http://www.novival.info/
I have
released 2 documentaries about my travels, and a third one will be released
after I return from my trip!This is why I
want the world to engage in this project by following me throughout my trip and
sending me personalized requests and challenges in order to help me create a
new documentary! How you can help:
You can help by
supporting this campaign by a simple share or by picking a perk and get some
really - I mean really - nice stuff in return as a sign of gratitude and
appreciation! Of course, you are free to share if you pick a perk, and for this
special engagement, I will send you a big, warm, virtual hug along with all the
awesome stuff you can get by supporting me!
How the money will be spent:
Support me to raise awareness about global warming, to
promote cycling as a clean, healthy and eco-friendly means of travel, to fight
for a world without borders, inclusion and equal access for kids to sports and
education in a post-conflict country!
The money will be spent
to finance the trip, to spread the message and to support our partners at Novi
Val in Blagaj, Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ten percent of all proceeds will be donated
to support Novi Val's work.

<p>When I first conceived this product in October of 2015, it

<p>Yes, it’s about women who have arm

atrophied arms. These women will now have the confidence to wear fashionable
sleeveless clothes again rather than clothes to cover the flaws.</p>
<p>Women think this product is the amazing!
No one realizes I’m wearing <b>My New Arms </b>until I ask,
“How do you think my arms look in this top?” Their response,….”They look great, have you been working
out?” Once I show them I’m wearing <b>My New Arms </b>their first
question is “Where can I buy one?”…. not, how much does it cost! but, where can I buy it! That tells me everything, that tells me there is a real need for <b>My New Arms.</b></p>
<p><b>Remember…</b></p>
<p>There are approximately 76.3 million
""Baby Boomers"" in the United States of which more than half are women over the
age of 50. It is estimated that 60% of these women will refrain from wearing
""sleeveless"" sports  tops, daytime dresses, or evening wear. Why? Because
they are embarrassed, or hate the way their arms look! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Let's face it... Mother nature isn't always fair to women!</span></p>
<p><b>What We Need....</b></p>
<p>I am seeking $50,000 for cost
of materials, manufacturing and distribution for the first 3,000 units. I have
a long list of women who have already placed orders and stores interested in
carrying <b><span>My New

<p>""We never know the worth of water until the well is dry"" - Thomas Fuller</p>
<p>Safe drinking water is one of the most urgent requirements of aid organisations in the critical first 24-48 hours following an event. Access to safe drinking water can help to prevent the spread of  disease, and greatly increases the chances of a community making a full recovery. </p>
<p>None of us can survive more than a few days without safe drinking water. The sad reality is that more than 1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and even more are exposed to unsafe drinking water following disasters and emergency events.</p>
<p>At Vinnovate, we believe we've developed a solution. </p>
<p>It's called Puribag. It's a low cost, lightweight, re-usable and mobile 10L water treatment system  to provide people with access to safe drinking water. The Puribag Project allows us to create a business with a social conscience, that promotes a social cause, and that will make a real-world impact by allowing users to create 150L of safe drinking water, when and where they need it most from almost any fresh water source. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Puribag Project</h3>
<p>We set out to design a low cost, low-tech solution to the issue of safe water provision. Our focus has been to create a bridge between the event or most urgent need for safe water occurring, and  the restoration of infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Puribag can be used under nearly any circumstances, and the things that make Puribag so valuable following events, make it equally as valuable in everyday life. The filter won't easily block, and you can remove all the nasty stuff; making the water safe to drink, for days. </p>
<p>This is a simple solution to the world's most pressing problem. </p>
<p>While many solutions focus on  high tech ways to solve the problem, these products normally command a high price, and it's often those who can't afford it who need it the most.</p>
<p>In re-thinking how aid is given, we focussed on a proactive approach to a situation, rather than being reactive. This means that a key goal was to develop a product which can be pre-positioned in high risk areas for up to 3 years, or air-dropped into an area immediately following the event.</p>
<p>In short, we set out to make a difference; to save people's lives. Through supporting the Puribag project, you can too!</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially we started as a beverage innovation company founded by brothers' Simon and Joshua Schmidt, with a focus on improving beverages for consumers. We soon found that our idea could have application in humanitarian pursuits, and we set about creating a unique water bag system.  </li>
<li>Having travelled to India on numerous occasions and learning about the work of the Tata Water Mission in providing aid and safe drinking water to millions of Indians per year, we decided that we'd found our first (of hopefully many) partner, and this was a mission we wanted to get on board with. </li>
<li>By supporting this project, you can make a real difference to someone's life. Donated Puribag's will be gifted to NGO's and aid organisations such as the Tata Water Mission to be stocked in disaster preparedness stations and deployed immediately following a disaster; thus reducing the burden on aid staff, empowering those affected to live their lives, and preventing the spread of waterborne disease.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Where we are at</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have successfully completed multiple pilot programs in rural India, converting contaminated fresh water into safe, potable drinking water. </li>
<li>We have all the pieces in place to get this project off the ground and doing good, we just need YOU to get on board, and make a real difference to someone else's life.</li>
<li>The goal of the campaign is to raise AUD$100,000. This funding will be used to establish commercial manufacturing of the Puribag, and to produce and DONATE a minimum of 2,000 bags.</li>
<li>2,000 bags can produce up to 300,000L of safe, potable drinking water and can do so under emergency conditions.</li>
<li>The Puribag, with its 150L functional capacity is ideal for camping, prepping and outdoor activities too. </li>
<li>Weighing around 200grams (approximately 7oz), the Puribag is the perfect addition to any 'go-bag' or backup water supply for the truck or the car!</li>
<li>Vinnovate is approaching this crowdfunding campaign as a pre-purchase opportunity. You can either buy for yourself, or choose to donate a Puribag which we will supply on your behalf. Either way, if you purchase a Puribag, you can do so in the knowledge that you're doing your bit to change the life of others less fortunate, when they're at their most vulnerable. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From Kerala, to the Pacific Islands, Houston to Townsville; no one is immune from a disaster event occurring. BUT, we can be prepared. </p>
<p>Your contribution will see this project come to life. If you wish to purchase the bag for yourself, that's amazing and will make your camping or outdoor trips, all the better. If you wish for it to be donated, you will be allowing us to provide bags to organisations such as the Tata Water Mission (and others), to place the Puribag in high risk areas where it can be deployed immediately following an event. This means instant access to safe water in the critical first 24-48 hours following an event.</p>
<p>It has been heartbreaking to see people affected; some even losing their lives after a disaster event.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Puribag Project allows people to create their own safe drinking water (150L) per bag; restoring independence, dignity and reducing the demands of aid organisations immediately after a disaster event!</li>
<li>Puribag lessens the requirement for people who've already suffered to then be confined to aid camps for their basic requirements.</li>
<li>The Puribag has been successfully tested in India, under some of the most trying conditions available, and come out with flying colours. </li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our journey so far </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The path to commercialising a new product is a long one. Over the past 4 years, we've travelled to India on multiple occasions to build relationships and show our commitment to our cause. We've spent time touring slums, meeting with businesses and with aid organisations to appreciate the real need for access to safe water; something many of us take for granted. </p>
<p>In recent years, we have been forced to sit back and watch as earthquakes, landslides, floods, cyclones, monsoons and wild weather has lashed parts of the world, knowing that we have conceived and developed a solution. Sadly, we've not yet been able to produce the product at commercial scale.</p>
<p>Every person deserves the right to access safe drinking water; it's even more important after an emergency or disaster event. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are resilient, dedicated, determined and confident. We have travelled the world, attending water events in the EU and in Asia. We have sured up the supply chain to ensure the Puribag can reach its intended audience, and the only thing left is to raise the funds to buy the tools. This is where we need your help. </li>

<h3>WAIDT?, What Am I Doing Today? Now you have an answer!</h3>
<p>WAIDT App or What Am I Doing Today? Can easily be summarized as the ultimate concierge application. What does it do? It saves guests time and money in their search for fun experiences anytime, anywhere!</p>
<p>Think of how long it takes you to find things to do on vacation, a free weekend from work, or a special night with a loved one. One hour? Three Hours? or More! You'll be surprised to know it takes some people hours at least a minimum of 6 hours from our research, and in some cases, it continues even when they land in their vacation spot.  Now with our App, hours become mere minutes, and your ability to plan your vacation or have a fun night out becomes simpler than calling for an Uber or Lyft.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>
<p>It's my fault, and I'm proud of it.  My name is James Alexander, and my background is as diverse as Elon Musk's ideas for the new world.  I have worked in several industries in Orlando, but my journey in this city began with a national television show called The Daily Buzz.  I produced, booked, marketed, served as community liaison and sales, which included working with National &amp; International companies producing their paid segments for TV shows, and negotiating contracts with Public Relations Firms.  </p>
<p>In 2014, I decided to leave the show after some changes and start my own company.  During my time with the Daily Buzz, finding things to do was easy because I was deeply connected to the industry.  My kids benefit by having an active schedule that included all things Orlando.  But when I started a business outside of entertainment, finances change dramatically, and so did my network.  I wanted to keep the same spirit of exploring the world. Still, I ran into several problems, including too many websites wanting my email to send ads, credit/debit card information that could be compromised, filters galore, hours in front of the computer or phone, and maintaining a budget. Yes, it sounds like chaos because it is!  Every time I would come up short on finding things to do within a reasonable budget. So like any good journalist, I researched to see if there was an app or website that was easy to use, personalized to me, customizable, and my payment for the experiences is made in one place, not several.  There was none, and then I decided to create WAIDT App.  There's more to the story; just <strong>WAIDT </strong>it gets better!</p>
<p>To further verify my assumptions, I joined Starter Studio, a tech accelerator located in Downtown Orlando.  It was there my passion for the development of this app grew by leaps and bounds.  I knew I had lightning in a bottle, and I could wait to show it off to you!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>This rollercoaster gets another rider!</h2>
<p>I shared my enthusiasm with a good friend who I trust to tell me the truth, wrong or right, about my ideas. JohnCarlo Pellicciotta was the first person I had to sell it to utilize his 15 years of experience in the Visual Communication field. He has a Master’s Degree in Arts, where his main area of study was Interactive Multimedia Arts. His career began in 2006 as a Web Designer specializing in e-Commerce software. He focused on two elements critical to creating a successful and well-designed website, User Interface and User Experience, commonly known as UI/UX.  His ideas fueled revenue growth and companies’ online presence across several industries, including Perfumania, Westgate Resorts, and the American Management Association.</p>
<p>In short, I knew he would be great as my Chief Technical Officer.  JohnCarlo has a passion for creating and innovating. The world will benefit from the unique and progressive ideas Mr. Pellicciotta has for the future of WAIDT.</p>

<h2><strong>It works!</strong></h2>
<p>Thanks to the innovative minds at Mythic Development, my idea now has a brain and personality matrix, more on that for contributors. The team at Mythic looked at my mapped-out idea, and within weeks we had the timeline created from start to launch for the app. This is an important step because you, as a contributor, have to be comfortable with building this platform.</p>
<p>Mythic Development has streamlined the development process, from building software, fixing or replacing older software structures, software architecture, integrations, and data reporting large and small. Get the information and software you need: no matter your field, where you are, or what device you are using.</p>
<p>Mythic Development places security at the forefront of every project. You can rest easy knowing that your information is safe and secure. Everything we do is encrypted using the strictest guidelines in the industry.</p>
<p>Our development team is superior to most development teams because our answer is “Yes, we can” – regardless of how complex the product you imagine. We fully understand every level of the development process, and our team knows nothing is impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Past clients of Mythic Development include NASA, Boeing, and Citrix.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629667397/wufbylrz5yeadfftyr3s.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here's where you come in!</strong></p>
<p>The brain and matrix of the platform are done, but we need your help to get through our final steps before launch.  Those steps include Travel and Tourism organization fees, marketing, conventions, UI/UX, legal fees, insurance, call centers, social media managers, staff, accounting, payroll, inventory, i.e., tickets, CLIA, and the United States Travel Association.</p>

</div></div>","WAIDT?, What Am I Doing Today? Now you have an answer!
WAIDT App or What Am I Doing Today? Can easily be summarized as the ultimate concierge application. What does it do? It saves guests time and money in their search for fun experiences anytime, anywhere!
Think of how long it takes you to find things to do on vacation, a free weekend from work, or a special night with a loved one. One hour? Three Hours? or More! You'll be surprised to know it takes some people hours at least a minimum of 6 hours from our research, and in some cases, it continues even when they land in their vacation spot.  Now with our App, hours become mere minutes, and your ability to plan your vacation or have a fun night out becomes simpler than calling for an Uber or Lyft.  
 
How did we get here?
It's my fault, and I'm proud of it.  My name is James Alexander, and my background is as diverse as Elon Musk's ideas for the new world.  I have worked in several industries in Orlando, but my journey in this city began with a national television show called The Daily Buzz.  I produced, booked, marketed, served as community liaison and sales, which included working with National & International companies producing their paid segments for TV shows, and negotiating contracts with Public Relations Firms.  
In 2014, I decided to leave the show after some changes and start my own company.  During my time with the Daily Buzz, finding things to do was easy because I was deeply connected to the industry.  My kids benefit by having an active schedule that included all things Orlando.  But when I started a business outside of entertainment, finances change dramatically, and so did my network.  I wanted to keep the same spirit of exploring the world. Still, I ran into several problems, including too many websites wanting my email to send ads, credit/debit card information that could be compromised, filters galore, hours in front of the computer or phone, and maintaining a budget. Yes, it sounds like chaos because it is!  Every time I would come up short on finding things to do within a reasonable budget. So like any good journalist, I researched to see if there was an app or website that was easy to use, personalized to me, customizable, and my payment for the experiences is made in one place, not several.  There was none, and then I decided to create WAIDT App.  There's more to the story; just WAIDT it gets better!
To further verify my assumptions, I joined Starter Studio, a tech accelerator located in Downtown Orlando.  It was there my passion for the development of this app grew by leaps and bounds.  I knew I had lightning in a bottle, and I could wait to show it off to you!

 
This rollercoaster gets another rider!
I shared my enthusiasm with a good friend who I trust to tell me the truth, wrong or right, about my ideas. JohnCarlo Pellicciotta was the first person I had to sell it to utilize his 15 years of experience in the Visual Communication field. He has a Master’s Degree in Arts, where his main area of study was Interactive Multimedia Arts. His career began in 2006 as a Web Designer specializing in e-Commerce software. He focused on two elements critical to creating a successful and well-designed website, User Interface and User Experience, commonly known as UI/UX.  His ideas fueled revenue growth and companies’ online presence across several industries, including Perfumania, Westgate Resorts, and the American Management Association.
In short, I knew he would be great as my Chief Technical Officer.  JohnCarlo has a passion for creating and innovating. The world will benefit from the unique and progressive ideas Mr. Pellicciotta has for the future of WAIDT.

 
It works!
Thanks to the innovative minds at Mythic Development, my idea now has a brain and personality matrix, more on that for contributors. The team at Mythic looked at my mapped-out idea, and within weeks we had the timeline created from start to launch for the app. This is an important step because you, as a contributor, have to be comfortable with building this platform.
Mythic Development has streamlined the development process, from building software, fixing or replacing older software structures, software architecture, integrations, and data reporting large and small. Get the information and software you need: no matter your field, where you are, or what device you are using.
Mythic Development places security at the forefront of every project. You can rest easy knowing that your information is safe and secure. Everything we do is encrypted using the strictest guidelines in the industry.
Our development team is superior to most development teams because our answer is “Yes, we can” – regardless of how complex the product you imagine. We fully understand every level of the development process, and our team knows nothing is impossible.
Past clients of Mythic Development include NASA, Boeing, and Citrix.

 
Here's where you come in!
The brain and matrix of the platform are done, but we need your help to get through our final steps before launch.  Those steps include Travel and Tourism organization fees, marketing, conventions, UI/UX, legal fees, insurance, call centers, social media managers, staff, accounting, payroll, inventory, i.e., tickets, CLIA, and the United States Travel Association.

<h3>You don't have to build it. I will.</h3>
<p>Here's how you can play your role in my next project. You can pledge for a night stay inside 3 reclaimed van that will be converted into a camper. Choose from few pledging option that will include great extreme sport activities, planned itineraries and dining experience!<br/><br/>But to those who don't know me, let me introduce myself to you. On 2014, I have made the whole Malaysian stumbled on my move to buy a piece of land in Klang and building my very own home using reclaimed containers! It has been 3 solid years for me living in this beautiful house.

<p>T&amp;O Star backpack is the most solid backpack in the world. It comes with a 14.25-inch-long and 11-inch-wide bullet-proof panel. The backpack is made with UHMWPE ballistic fabric. Additionally, it was created with special techniques to make the plate as light and portable as possible. NTS-Chesapeake Testing reviewed the backpack with the Armor Protection Ballistic Resistance Test and concluded that the panel is strong enough to shield a gunshot from a 9mm pistol.</p>
<p>Due to restrictions on gun advertising content, none of the shooting demonstrations can be provided. However, an accountable test report, which contains repeatable and reproducible results of the lab shooting the backpack, is provided in the description.</p>

<h3>Easy to set up</h3>
<p>Straight out of the bag Zungee can be set up in less than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>attach the safety lanyard to a post or tree</strong> rather than using the ground anchors provided.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Zungee</strong></h3>
<p>We love the concept of horizontal bungee, there are so few truly exciting things to do in your own backyard. While petanque, bocce &amp; croquet are enjoyable, they are hardly exciting.<br/>Zungee offers everyone - kids and adults a chance to play something a little exhilarating</p>
<p>We want to make Zungee the ultimate, most renowned game for outdoor backyard use by creating an easily obtainable, simple, home recreational activity for BBQs, parties, kids birthdays' or the family gathering.</p>
<h3>Kids and Adults can play Zungee</h3>

<div>Zungee can  be played by both adults and kids over the age of 8. A weight of 30Kg (66lbs) is approximately the minimum weight. Maximum weight for adults is 125Kg (275lb)</div>
<div> </div>
<div><h3><strong>Quality &amp; Safety</strong></h3></div>
<p>We use only the best quality materials for Zungee because we want it to last for many seasons of entertainment and we want you to be safe. You would definitely say we have way over engineered the product for both durability and our peace of mind.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Our Carabiners are the same locking clasps that mountain climbers use</strong>. They attach to both the user's waist belt and the ground anchor are rated at 12kN, that's more than 1200Kg's or 2600 lbs of weight loading capability. In comparison the load on the bungee rope when stretched is less than 100Kg or 220lbs. They are super tough and  will last for a very long time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Zungee is also equipped with a safety Anchor system</strong>, meaning there are two joined ground anchors. If for some reason the primary anchor is pulled out of the ground when in use the secondary anchor is there to catch the load.<br/>The two anchors are joined together with a heavy duty webbing strap and two more carabiners and the lanyard is rated at 23kN over 2300Kg's or 5000lbs far far in excess of any load that the equipment should experience in normal use. We use this system so you have options on how to anchor the bungee rope, placing the anchors in the most effective locations.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Could I make my own horizontal bungee kit? </strong></p>
<p>Sure you can. Some of the individual components of horizontal bungee are obtainable.  <br/>Bungee / bungy like this has been around for around 30 years or more.<br/>The time and effort to obtain individual parts and the likely performance, quality, safety and costs when purchased individually would easily exceed the cost of a Zungee kit.<br/>Zungee offers a simple and cost-effective solution while eliminating the hassles and dangers of DIY versions.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there Adult and kid versions?</strong></p>
<p>Its a case of simple math, a 30kg (66lb) child does not have the pulling strength of a 120Kg (260lb) Person. We had to make  heavier cord for adults.<br/>No matter how hard we tried, there was no simple method to make a one size fits all product</p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between training bungee and Zungee?</strong></p>
<p>Training bungees are made of a single tubular bungee. These tube bungees offer low strength elasticity and safety in comparison to Zungee ropes. Zungee ropes are made of multi-strand silicone impregnated latex and are what is used by commercial vertical bungee jumping operations. The Zungee cord offers far greater elasticity and long-term strength.</p>

<p><strong>What does a Zungee kit weigh?</strong><br/>Approximately 11 kg or 25 lbs </p>
<p><strong>What ages is Zungee suitable for?</strong><br/>We offer the guideline that the Zungee Kids kit is suitable for children from 8 years old onwards. Smaller lighter children under 30Kg (66lb) may struggle to pull the rope.</p>
<p><strong>What's the difference between kids and adult Zungee?</strong><br/>Adult Zungee ropes are thicker and designed to give sufficient pull for an adult weighing 60Kg (132 lb) or more. Children struggle to pull the thicker heavier adult rope.</p>

</ul><p> </p></div>","Face of Indawgyi is the first social enterprise in our part of Myanmar. We are a locally registered company and we promote the welfare of the Indawgyi Lake region and its residents. It is a community-focused organization that promotes four main pillars: educational opportunities, cultural preservation, environmental conservation, and sustainable development. 
 Reduce and remove plastic waste by creating a comfortable space for tourists to stay and use this money to create infrastructure and build awareness. After two years, we are getting closer to this goal, but need your help.  From our website and social media to all the projects we do around the lake, everything we do is geared towards connecting you to the community.    
With $70,000, we will have the money to start construction of the hotel/training-school. It's not everything we need, but it's a strong start.
From here, we can begin implementing larger scale community projects that we have been developing such as promoting the dying local language of Shan-ni, developing local sustainable industries, expanding our plastic awareness campaign, and develop the hotel training-school. 
 Around Indawgyi Lake, there is a huge absence of opportunity for children to find secure employment. Formal education for most ends before the tenth grade and the majority of work is seasonal fishing and rice farming. Through partnerships with local families and experienced hospitality trainers, the hotel school will draw in additional foreign and local visitors to the region to effectively prepare the local economy for future growth.   Freshwater shrimping, local cooking classes, riding bamboo bicycles and trekking through mountains—these experiences we already offer allow you to engage in a range of unique activities only found here. Even now, just by participating in these experiences you directly support our community projects. So be sure to check out the Indawgyi Lake Experiences perk package!     Face of Indawgyi is a coming together of friends, but this is not just our project - this is everyone's project. My name is Stephen, I'm a sociologist and I first came to Myanmar and Indawgyi in 2015.

Everybody has something to offer to help make this project a success.  Indawgyi is still something of an undiscovered gem, but as its visibility increases, there are many ways that it can be developed. We want to ensure that it is done sustainably and that it maintains the natural harmony and beauty that the lake's residents have enjoyed for countless generations. Indawgyi Lake was recently designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.

We will provide specialized hospitality courses to Indawgyi residents as young as 16 years old and offer an official certificate upon completion. As part of a two-year contract for training and employment, we will provide students a monthly stipend with half given for their personal use and the other half put in a savings account along with a completion bonus.These savings are key in allowing children to start a new life where they have the option to either continue work at home or find hospitality jobs in cities elsewhere in Myanmar and abroad. Face of Indawgyi has already established an office at the lake. We are the first foreign company registered in the township and the third in Kachin State. During the past months, we have done numerous projects in our four target areas.One example was a plastic awareness campaign utilizing locally-made sustainable trash cans that created the infrastructure to support the waste needs of four villages and two tourist sites. We have also trained a small staff and have hosted two interns to assist in our day-to-day operations.Finally, we post all our social media content in both Burmese and English to reach domestic and international audiences and are continuing to work to add more languages to our platform!  Our projects have already attracted the attention of local and international media including Frontier Myanmar, Sampan Travel Magazine,Myanmore, Coconuts Yangon, Le Petite Journal, Eleven News Media, Mizzima,  and others. We have a growing social media following both in Myanmar and abroad creating awareness of our brand and mission.  We have also worked with local partners to create a travel platform,  Find Myanmar, making Kachin State more accessible to travelers. There's not much information about the state in English, and through this site, we have helped both local and foreign tourists get a new perspective on an undiscovered area.  Not only will you be helping to support communities throughout Myanmar, but you will receive awesome gifts you can either keep, and put them on your coffee table, or you can gift them to your loved ones.There are many cool things to choose from like:
Embarrassing photographs of the project coordinators 
Customized, unique experiences in Indawgyi Lake
Handmade gifts, like longyis, scarves and more from small villages in Myanmar.
And much more! Check out the perks on the right side of this page for the full list.
What Happens If We Don't Raise All The Funds?If we don't collect all the funds we are asking for here, then we will go to investors. We've already prepared a pitch deck, but the more money we raise here, the quicker we can get to creating better, more impactful projects at the lake.  E-mail it. Share it. Post it. Tweet it.  We understand not everyone can give, but you can help us spread the word! We will be posting videos, updates, pictures, interviews, and blogs to keep you informed on our progress. Use the share tools on this campaign to help us meet our goal, and get ready to explore this dynamic country with us!For further information on our mission and our progress, check out our website: www.faceofindawgyi.orgPlease go to the top of the page and press ""Back it"" or and feel free to choose the amount of donation or choose your favorite perk.VISIT US:  https://www.faceofindawgyi.orgFOLLOW US and SHARE:https://www.facebook.com/faceofindawgyihttps://www.instagram.com/faceofindawgyi ​CONNECT WITH US: stephen@faceofindawgyi.orgTHANK YOU!Face of Indawgyi Team How do I tell you which photos/prints I want? If your perk requires you to choose something (e.g. choosing which photo you want), make your selection by leaving a private comment for us on our Indiegogo page. The ""Comment"" tab is just below the project title ""Face of Myanmar"".

With custom goods, it may take additional time. Please note, that we are in a very isolated area and shipping can be a challenge so do be patient. We can send out electronic perks quickly, but other items will take some time ;) Why isn't my credit card working when it normally does? If you're able to input all of your billing information on the contribute page, but Indiegogo still isn't accepting your credit card, report the problem directly to support@indiegogo.com. For Adopt a Brick perk:  You have 35 characters of your choice. Dedicate it to your family, friends or even yourself. Pour your heart out.

Still, significant additional funds are needed.Originally, I saved enough money to cover the land lease and initial construction costs, but the capital required to legally register our company and start operations have used up most of these savings.We have been approached by several interested investors and know that we will find financing and turn Lon Ton Social Impact Guesthouse into a reality. But investors focus on returns and we want to stay focused on what is important to us. We have a mission – to use revenue from sustainable tourism as a way to fund projects at the lake. The more money we raise from crowdfunding, the less we have to return to investors and the quicker we can get larger scale projects up and running. What have we done and invested into up to now?

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're sailing the 65' classic 1929 race-winning yacht The Blue Peter (@thebluepeteryacht) from English Harbor in Antigua to Nantucket. An approximately 1500 nautical mile trip mostly around 400 miles off the US coast, through the Bermuda Triangle, with a quick stop in Bermuda to check comms and refuel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our motley crew of Gentlemen Rogues was created by a partnership of New York based bespoke Englishman, Duncan Quinn (@duncan_quinn), and Mat Barker, the owner and captain of The Blue Peter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We'll be fueled by the wind, and plenty of the Official Rosé of Antigua Classic Yacht Regatta - our very own Provençal rosé, Quinn Rosé (@drinkquinn), which is made around 30 minutes north of St Tropez in the south of France.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're looking to raise $33,001. But every dollar counts.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To fund this adventure we're:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">1) shipping Quinn Rosé direct to you across the USA. Shipping is free for 6btls or more - you get to drink, we get to sail...win-win!;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">2) taking bookings for charters of The Blue Peter in Nantucket this summer and beyond - get your own chance to sail aboard this beautiful classic yacht;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">3) Selling swag - caps, tees and other good stuff;</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">4) maybe get a mention in Maxim Magazine (Duncan Quinn is the Editor-at-Large) - this is free</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">All perks are offered at a discount to the open market, are not charity asks for a freebie, and have real value. Hell we even think you'll enjoy them all and your mates will be jealous and want some (feel free to point them in the right direction.)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Without your support this flight of fancy won't make it to it's destination. So please join our motley crew from afar, and sip some rosé as we all raise a glass together on our trip from the Caribbean to Nantucket.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If we don't reach our goal we're still going to take a run at it - all funds will be used to support the cause, and the more we raise towards our goal the easier it becomes for us not to die of scurvy or float off course into the Bermuda Triangle to reappear in 1942.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Adventure is the heart of human discovery. We can't all discover a new continent, climb a new mountain, or investigate the depths of the ocean. But we can support such endeavors. And know that we are a part of making dreams achievable. Both for those pursuing the adventure, and others who dream of pursuing them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Duncan Quinn has been saying ""yes"" to adventures ever since he was a kid. From lonely travels through far flung destinations long before social media recorded these things in minute (and sometimes annoying) detail, to annual road trips across Africa to compete in a 4x4 rally to save elephants and help conservation in Zambia. He's a man who rises to challenges. And wants you to join in the fun as much as you can.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mat Barker left a cushy job at a bank in 1999 and used his savings to buy The Blue Peter and restore her. He's been sailing the world ever since, funding his adventures by taking those with the need for speed yacht racing across the globe. And mostly winning. In Antigua, Palma, St Tropez and elsewhere.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We're asking you to help our adventure. And the dreams of those who think that such things are not possible.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Nothing is ever easy. But offshore sailing on a 100 year old teak and bronze yacht with canvas sails is definitely a challenge. We're not all trained sailors, and in fact more than a few of the crew are better at inhaling rosé than they are at tying a knot.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Although it may sound like a sunbathing extravaganza there'll be blood, sweat and tears. As well as 24 hour watches taken in shifts to make sure we remain on course.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Although we have a plan, as the old joke goes, making a plan is usually the way to make God laugh. So we'll be using our survival and other skills to make it from Antigua to Nantucket in one piece.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you'd love to help, but your rosé budget doesn't extend to a bottle, a case or a lake, and you can't corral your buddies into springing for charter aboard Blue Peter this summer in Nantucket please help in any other way you can. From getting the word out on social media, to using the Indigogo share tools, or getting your company to send us something of use we can put in our social media and other stories along the line.</p>

All perks are offered at a discount to the open market, are not charity asks for a freebie, and have real value. Hell we even think you'll enjoy them all and your mates will be jealous and want some (feel free to point them in the right direction.)
Without your support this flight of fancy won't make it to it's destination. So please join our motley crew from afar, and sip some rosé as we all raise a glass together on our trip from the Caribbean to Nantucket.
If we don't reach our goal we're still going to take a run at it - all funds will be used to support the cause, and the more we raise towards our goal the easier it becomes for us not to die of scurvy or float off course into the Bermuda Triangle to reappear in 1942.

The Impact
Adventure is the heart of human discovery. We can't all discover a new continent, climb a new mountain, or investigate the depths of the ocean. But we can support such endeavors. And know that we are a part of making dreams achievable. Both for those pursuing the adventure, and others who dream of pursuing them.
Duncan Quinn has been saying ""yes"" to adventures ever since he was a kid. From lonely travels through far flung destinations long before social media recorded these things in minute (and sometimes annoying) detail, to annual road trips across Africa to compete in a 4x4 rally to save elephants and help conservation in Zambia. He's a man who rises to challenges. And wants you to join in the fun as much as you can.
Mat Barker left a cushy job at a bank in 1999 and used his savings to buy The Blue Peter and restore her. He's been sailing the world ever since, funding his adventures by taking those with the need for speed yacht racing across the globe. And mostly winning. In Antigua, Palma, St Tropez and elsewhere.
We're asking you to help our adventure. And the dreams of those who think that such things are not possible.
Risks & Challenges

Nothing is ever easy. But offshore sailing on a 100 year old teak and bronze yacht with canvas sails is definitely a challenge. We're not all trained sailors, and in fact more than a few of the crew are better at inhaling rosé than they are at tying a knot.
Although it may sound like a sunbathing extravaganza there'll be blood, sweat and tears. As well as 24 hour watches taken in shifts to make sure we remain on course.
Although we have a plan, as the old joke goes, making a plan is usually the way to make God laugh. So we'll be using our survival and other skills to make it from Antigua to Nantucket in one piece.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you'd love to help, but your rosé budget doesn't extend to a bottle, a case or a lake, and you can't corral your buddies into springing for charter aboard Blue Peter this summer in Nantucket please help in any other way you can. From getting the word out on social media, to using the Indigogo share tools, or getting your company to send us something of use we can put in our social media and other stories along the line.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><strong><u>CAMPAIN AND PRODUCT</u></strong></p><p>By creating the Luminaris lanterns, our goal was to offer a solution to the need for mood lighting, both during activities such as LARP and to add to the atmosphere during a game or an evening between friends outside. We presented our project to LARP event organizers, players, and well-known stores, who showed us a strong interest. Our goal is to provide a decorative lighting object that is stylized, customizable and resistant to water and moderate impacts.<br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/VBUeWHG.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>Why buy our lantern?</p><ol>

<p><strong>Buy your lantern - the two lighting models</strong></p>
</div></div><p>You have to choose one of the two electronic models, which give you different lighting possibilities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>1A. The model simulating a flame</strong></p><p>""Flame"" type lighting is produced by a microcontroller. The system is thus controlled by a 3-position button under the base of the lantern; 0 (off), 1 (energy saving lighting) or 2 (maximum lighting). The device is not controlled remotely.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/RO2KcAf.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>1B. The RGB model with Bluetooth connection</strong></p><p>RGB lighting is controlled by a smartphone via Bluetooth. After turning on the power to the lantern (button below), the lantern will light up at the last selected color. You can then connect one or more lanterns to your smartphone with the ""HappyLighting"" application (application developed by QH-TEK).</p><p>After connecting your lantern(s), you can choose the type of lighting: the level of intensity, the solid color, lighting modes, and speed (from a list, including oscillations, flashes, gradients, etc.), as well as a “music” mode (where the colors move according to the sounds picked up by the phone). However, there is no flame simulating mode and a phone is required to set the lighting. Once the desired mode is selected, the phone can be disconnected, and the lantern continues to operate.</p><p>Note that other apps may work, however we recommend this one, which we have been using for other RGB / Bluetooth projects for the past 2 years.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/gsQQSci.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/Yj0oloI.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/3DLNbjG.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/oL3uOWJ.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Battery life and recharging</strong></p><p>The power supply for the lantern is based on a 10,000mah battery pack (included). The battery life depends on the selected lighting mode. You can charge the battery pack with a USB cable (supplied), at an electrical outlet or in the car. After our tests, here are the realistic estimates:</p><ul>
<li>Ambient / minimal lighting: up to 25h</li>
<li>Maximal lighting : up to 6h</li>
<li>Required time to charge a completely empty power pack : up to 10h<br/> </li>
</ul><p>Note that the duration can be shorter depending on the power of the charging source. Using a 2A charger, the average charging time is 5.5-7 hours. The battery life may vary depending on production components and wear. By the end of the campaign, our goal is to maximize uptime, without compromising on the quality of lighting.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/oO14xBD.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/dsYrqef.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>WHY BUY NOW?</u></strong></p><p>Rather than launching sales directly, we determined that a fundraising campaign would be of benefit to donors as well as our business.

This project is far along its path as we have focused on finalizing this project that we had started in the last months of 2019.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598563476/lkceula7qakrfouzordo.png"" src=""""/></p><p>First, the prototyping phase is complete. We have produced 10 versions of the classic model to test style and durability. We have developed and tested several types of electronics, as well as power supplies. We can thus offer these two choices (RGB or flame-simulated) with a long battery life. At the current time, we are finalizing minor adjustments (selecting a suitable turn-on button, confirming prices for LEDs and other components according to certain purchase volumes, etc.), as well as completing the user guide ( paper / digital version, but also a video version).</p><p>We believe we have the necessary elements in place to meet a vast demand. In terms of production, the equipment we have at the moment allows us to produce between 50 and 75 lanterns per week. If necessary, we have already negotiated agreements to acquire the necessary equipment to increase our production. We can start the production of the exterior and decorative parts of the lantern within a few days. For electronics, we have a stock to start production, but orders will allow us to make purchases in bulk.</p><p>Our main challenge is to offer this unique product made in Canada, while reducing our costs as much as possible to sell it at a competitive price. To achieve this, the campaign aims to ensure a sales volume to allow us to buy in large quantities directly from suppliers / distributors.</p><p>The main risk relates to supply in this particular period. Although we make great efforts to purchase from local suppliers or distributors, most electronic components are originally produced outside of America. Thus, whether it is our seller in Asia or the local distributor, there are risks of delay in receiving these goods due to Covid-19. However, this does not entail any risks in the realization of the project, only in terms of a delay in delivery.</p><ul></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/xhc29uV.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>BACKGROUND</u></strong></p><p>AscensionX is a Montreal-based company specializing in innovation.

<p><strong>Acheter votre lanterne - les deux modèles d’éclairage</strong></p>
</div><p>Vous devez choisir l’un des deux modèles d’électronique, qui vous offre des possibilités d’éclairage différentes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>1A. Le modèle simulant une flamme</strong></p><p>L’éclairage de type « flamme » est un système contrôlé par un microcontrôleur. Le système est ainsi contrôlé par un bouton sous la base de la lanterne à 3 positions; 0 (fermé), 1 (éclairage économique) ou 2 (éclairage maximal). L’appareil n’est pas contrôlé à distance.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/RO2KcAf.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>1B. Le modèle RGB avec connexion Bluetooth</strong></p><p>L’éclairage RGB est contrôlé par un téléphone intelligent par Bluetooth. Après avoir allumé l’alimentation de la lanterne (bouton en dessous), la lanterne s’allume à la dernière couleur sélectionnée. Vous pouvez ensuite connecter une ou des lanternes à votre téléphone intelligent avec l’application « HappyLighting » (application développée par QH-TEK).</p><p><br/>Après avoir connecté votre/vos lanterne(s), vous pouvez choisir le type d’éclairage : le niveau d’intensité de l’éclairage, la couleur pleine (au choix), modes d’éclairage et leur vitesse (parmi une liste, dont oscillations, flashs, dégradés, etc.), ainsi qu’un mode « musique » (où les couleurs bougent en fonction des sons captés par le téléphone). Toutefois, il n’y a pas de mode simulant une flamme et un téléphone est nécessaire pour contrôler l’éclairage. Ceci dit, une fois le mode souhaité sélectionné, le téléphone peut être déconnecté et la lanterne continue son fonctionnement.</p><p><br/>À noter que d’autres applications peuvent fonctionner, cependant nous recommandons celle-ci, que nous utilisons pour d’autres projets RGB/Bluetooth depuis 2 ans.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/gsQQSci.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/Yj0oloI.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/3DLNbjG.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/oL3uOWJ.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Durée de vie des piles et recharge</strong></p><p>L’alimentation de la lanterne repose sur un bloc pile de 10 000mah (inclus). La durée de vie de la pile dépend du mode d’éclairage sélectionné. Vous pouvez recharger le bloc pile avec un câble USB (fourni), avec un bloc pile de recharge de téléphone intelligent, une prise électrique ou dans la voiture. Après nos tests, voici les estimations réalistes :</p><ul>
<li>Éclairage d’ambiance / minimal : jusqu’à 25h</li>
<li>Éclairage maximal : jusqu’à 6h</li>
<li>Temps nécessaire pour recharger le bloc pile complètement déchargé : jusqu’à 10h.<br/> </li>
</ul><p>À noter que la durée pourrait être plus courte en fonction de la puissance de la source de chargement. En utilisant un chargeur 2A, le temps moyen de recharge est de 5,5 à 7 heures. La durée pourrait varier en fonction des composantes de production et de l’usure. D’ici la fin de la campagne, notre objectif est d’augmenter au maximum le temps d’utilisation, sans réduire la qualité de l’éclairage. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/oO14xBD.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/dsYrqef.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>POURQUOI ACHETER MAINTENANT?</u></strong></p><p>Plutôt que de lancer des ventes directement, nous avons déterminé qu’une campagne de financement serait un atout autant pour les donateurs que notre entreprise.

Nous avons produit 10 versions du modèle classique pour tester le style et la résistance. Nous avons développé et testé plusieurs types d’électronique, ainsi que d’alimentation. Nous pouvons ainsi offrir ces deux choix (RGB ou flammes-simulées) avec une longue durée de vie de la pile. Au moment actuel, nous finalisons des ajustements mineurs (sélectionner un bouton d’allumage adapté, confirmer les prix pour les DEL et autres composantes selon certains volumes d’achat, etc.), ainsi qu’à compléter le guide d’utilisation complet (version papier/digitale, mais aussi une version vidéo).</p><p>Nous croyons avoir mis en place les éléments nécessaires pour répondre à une vaste demande. Pour ce qui est de la production, les équipements que nous avons au moment actuel nous permettent de produire entre 50 et 75 lanternes par semaine. En cas de besoin, nous avons déjà négocié des ententes pour acquérir les équipements nécessaires pour augmenter notre production. Nous pouvons lancer en quelques jours la production des parties extérieures et décoratives de la lanterne. Pour l’électronique, nous avons un stock pour débuter la production, mais les commandes nous permettrons d’effectuer un achat important.</p><p>Notre principal défi est d’offrir ce produit unique fabriqué au Canada, tout en réduisant nos coûts au maximum pour le vendre à un prix compétitif. Pour y parvenir, la campagne a pour objectif de garantir un volume de vente pour nous permettre d’acheter en grande quantité directement de fournisseurs/distributeurs.</p><p>Le principal risque concerne l’approvisionnement dans cette période particulière. Bien que nous placions d’importants efforts pour acheter de fournisseurs ou distributeurs locaux, la majorité des composantes électroniques sont originalement produites en dehors de l’Amérique. Ainsi, que ce soit notre vendeur en Asie ou le distributeur local, il existe des risques de délai de réception de ces marchandises en raison de la Covid-19. Cependant, cela n’entraîne pas de risques quant à la réalisation du projet, seulement en termes d’un délai en cas de retard de livraison.</p><ul></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/xhc29uV.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><u>HISTOIRE</u></strong></p><p>AscensionX est une compagnie montréalaise se spécialisant dans l'innovation.

CAMPAIN AND PRODUCTBy creating the Luminaris lanterns, our goal was to offer a solution to the need for mood lighting, both during activities such as LARP and to add to the atmosphere during a game or an evening between friends outside. We presented our project to LARP event organizers, players, and well-known stores, who showed us a strong interest. Our goal is to provide a decorative lighting object that is stylized, customizable and resistant to water and moderate impacts. Why buy our lantern?
Safe : no risk of fire
Energy-efficient LED lighting: up to 25 hours of battery life
Choose one of two models according to your needs: simulated flames or RGB via Bluetooth
Water resistance 
Resistance to moderate impacts
Unique style with endless possibilities for customization
Recyclable components at 90% 


 
 
Buy your lantern - the two lighting models
You have to choose one of the two electronic models, which give you different lighting possibilities. 1A. The model simulating a flame""Flame"" type lighting is produced by a microcontroller. The system is thus controlled by a 3-position button under the base of the lantern; 0 (off), 1 (energy saving lighting) or 2 (maximum lighting). The device is not controlled remotely. 1B. The RGB model with Bluetooth connectionRGB lighting is controlled by a smartphone via Bluetooth. After turning on the power to the lantern (button below), the lantern will light up at the last selected color. You can then connect one or more lanterns to your smartphone with the ""HappyLighting"" application (application developed by QH-TEK).After connecting your lantern(s), you can choose the type of lighting: the level of intensity, the solid color, lighting modes, and speed (from a list, including oscillations, flashes, gradients, etc.), as well as a “music” mode (where the colors move according to the sounds picked up by the phone). However, there is no flame simulating mode and a phone is required to set the lighting. Once the desired mode is selected, the phone can be disconnected, and the lantern continues to operate.Note that other apps may work, however we recommend this one, which we have been using for other RGB / Bluetooth projects for the past 2 years. Battery life and rechargingThe power supply for the lantern is based on a 10,000mah battery pack (included). The battery life depends on the selected lighting mode. You can charge the battery pack with a USB cable (supplied), at an electrical outlet or in the car. After our tests, here are the realistic estimates:
Ambient / minimal lighting: up to 25h
Maximal lighting : up to 6h
Required time to charge a completely empty power pack : up to 10h 
Note that the duration can be shorter depending on the power of the charging source. Using a 2A charger, the average charging time is 5.5-7 hours. The battery life may vary depending on production components and wear. By the end of the campaign, our goal is to maximize uptime, without compromising on the quality of lighting. WHY BUY NOW?Rather than launching sales directly, we determined that a fundraising campaign would be of benefit to donors as well as our business. You save ± $ 50 on the regular price: you pay $ 125 instead of $ 175. You also have the opportunity to get unique and free rewards from this campaign, which will be sold as an option later.For our company, this campaign is used to generate sales to support the development of the Lantern - Luminaris. The revenues will allow us to invest in acquiring electronic components in greater volume to reduce costs and continue to develop possibilities for customization. We will also be able to validate the designs and colors that are the most popular to guide product development. Your opinions will thus have an impact on the development of this product. WHAT YOU GETWhen you buy a lantern, you have many choices. At the start, there's 216 possibilities of combination to create your unique model. Please note that depending on the sales during the campaign, many more options will be unlocked. LUMINARIS LANTERNYou get a lantern (battery pack included), a USB charging cable, and eligible perks / additional options.

 CHALLENGES AND RISKSBy ordering from AscensionX, your risk is low for several reasons. This project is far along its path as we have focused on finalizing this project that we had started in the last months of 2019.First, the prototyping phase is complete. We have produced 10 versions of the classic model to test style and durability. We have developed and tested several types of electronics, as well as power supplies. We can thus offer these two choices (RGB or flame-simulated) with a long battery life. At the current time, we are finalizing minor adjustments (selecting a suitable turn-on button, confirming prices for LEDs and other components according to certain purchase volumes, etc.), as well as completing the user guide ( paper / digital version, but also a video version).We believe we have the necessary elements in place to meet a vast demand. In terms of production, the equipment we have at the moment allows us to produce between 50 and 75 lanterns per week. If necessary, we have already negotiated agreements to acquire the necessary equipment to increase our production. We can start the production of the exterior and decorative parts of the lantern within a few days. For electronics, we have a stock to start production, but orders will allow us to make purchases in bulk.Our main challenge is to offer this unique product made in Canada, while reducing our costs as much as possible to sell it at a competitive price. To achieve this, the campaign aims to ensure a sales volume to allow us to buy in large quantities directly from suppliers / distributors.The main risk relates to supply in this particular period. Although we make great efforts to purchase from local suppliers or distributors, most electronic components are originally produced outside of America. Thus, whether it is our seller in Asia or the local distributor, there are risks of delay in receiving these goods due to Covid-19. However, this does not entail any risks in the realization of the project, only in terms of a delay in delivery. BACKGROUNDAscensionX is a Montreal-based company specializing in innovation. It offers an advisory service to both small and medium-sized businesses as well as individuals for the production of 3D printed objects and accessories including electronics.The wide range of knowledge of its team allows it to serve various fields including the artistic field (art, comedians), television, movie production, advertising, events (escape room, fan art, cosplay, LARP, promotional products) and engineering (part design, prototyping, production, etc.). You have a project in mind? We have the solution.For the past 20 years, the co-founders have been involved in organizing events and the creation of equipment, accessories, and sets. As part of AscensionX, the team has been working on contracts for 2 years in design and manufacturing with 3D printing equipment. The team has always been involved in the communities of LARP, but also draws influence from fantastic and creative universes. This experience in design, 3D printing and electronics, combined with an interest in these worlds gave the idea to create a unique product: the Luminaris lantern.  THE TEAMIn their individual journeys, the four co-founders of the company have taken an interest in new technologies, organizing events, and research.Nicolas Fournier - Head of Operations / Technical Specialist - has multidisciplinary training in technology (technician in mechanical engineering) and in research (doctoral student in history). In his spare time, he set up and coordinated fun and educational activities to generate learning through play, deserving of numerous awards / nominations (Quebec Entrepreneurship Contest, Canadian House of Commons, as well as in the Mon Entreprise competition of UQÀM).Miguel Gagnon - Project manager / Electronics specialist - completed a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering at Polytechnique Montréal before continuing his master's training in research in digital simulation of multiphysics phenomena. He has been involved in several technology projects, notably as technical director and then general manager of Oronos. He has knowledge of programming, 3D modeling, systems design as well as electronics and electrical design.Marie-Pier Théberge – Head of marketing / Concept Artist - is an artist, with doctoral studies in arts studies and practices at the University of Quebec in Montreal. Her artistic practice is the subject of multidisciplinary installations that hybridize sculptural, performative, pictorial, and digital works. She carried out commercial graphic design projects and collaborations with artists from various backgrounds (logos, graphics, collectible figurines, etc.).Along the same lines as the latter, Guillaume Bourdon - Social Media Manager / Production Specialist - has his master's degree in visual and media arts at UQAM. Guillaume specializes in new media, such as photography, digital video, programming, and interactive installation, as well as traditional techniques such as screen printing, painting, and sculpting. His artistic projects exploit 3D printing, virtual and augmented reality, as well as new technologies.  OUR SUCCESSESOur successful March 2020 GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign:March 2020 : recognizing the urgent need for artificial respirators, we raised $2,300 (out of a goal of $2,000) to participate in the “Code Life Ventilator Challenge” competition, launched by the Montreal General Hospital Foundation, in collaboration with the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center. The goal: to create a simple, inexpensive, and easily fabricable artificial respirator. Over 1,060 organizations from around the world participated, some of which were made up of leading medical research groups and companies. We were among the 60 finalists of the competition. At the moment, the first two phases of prototyping are completed, we are in the duration tests and improving the programming of the device. You can see the campaign on GoFundMe: gofundme.com/f/sauvons-chaque-vieOur achievements :

Acheter votre lanterne - les deux modèles d’éclairage
Vous devez choisir l’un des deux modèles d’électronique, qui vous offre des possibilités d’éclairage différentes. 1A. Le modèle simulant une flammeL’éclairage de type « flamme » est un système contrôlé par un microcontrôleur. Le système est ainsi contrôlé par un bouton sous la base de la lanterne à 3 positions; 0 (fermé), 1 (éclairage économique) ou 2 (éclairage maximal). L’appareil n’est pas contrôlé à distance. 1B. Le modèle RGB avec connexion BluetoothL’éclairage RGB est contrôlé par un téléphone intelligent par Bluetooth. Après avoir allumé l’alimentation de la lanterne (bouton en dessous), la lanterne s’allume à la dernière couleur sélectionnée. Vous pouvez ensuite connecter une ou des lanternes à votre téléphone intelligent avec l’application « HappyLighting » (application développée par QH-TEK).Après avoir connecté votre/vos lanterne(s), vous pouvez choisir le type d’éclairage : le niveau d’intensité de l’éclairage, la couleur pleine (au choix), modes d’éclairage et leur vitesse (parmi une liste, dont oscillations, flashs, dégradés, etc.), ainsi qu’un mode « musique » (où les couleurs bougent en fonction des sons captés par le téléphone). Toutefois, il n’y a pas de mode simulant une flamme et un téléphone est nécessaire pour contrôler l’éclairage. Ceci dit, une fois le mode souhaité sélectionné, le téléphone peut être déconnecté et la lanterne continue son fonctionnement.À noter que d’autres applications peuvent fonctionner, cependant nous recommandons celle-ci, que nous utilisons pour d’autres projets RGB/Bluetooth depuis 2 ans. Durée de vie des piles et rechargeL’alimentation de la lanterne repose sur un bloc pile de 10 000mah (inclus). La durée de vie de la pile dépend du mode d’éclairage sélectionné. Vous pouvez recharger le bloc pile avec un câble USB (fourni), avec un bloc pile de recharge de téléphone intelligent, une prise électrique ou dans la voiture. Après nos tests, voici les estimations réalistes :
Éclairage d’ambiance / minimal : jusqu’à 25h
Éclairage maximal : jusqu’à 6h
Temps nécessaire pour recharger le bloc pile complètement déchargé : jusqu’à 10h. 
À noter que la durée pourrait être plus courte en fonction de la puissance de la source de chargement. En utilisant un chargeur 2A, le temps moyen de recharge est de 5,5 à 7 heures. La durée pourrait varier en fonction des composantes de production et de l’usure. D’ici la fin de la campagne, notre objectif est d’augmenter au maximum le temps d’utilisation, sans réduire la qualité de l’éclairage.   POURQUOI ACHETER MAINTENANT?Plutôt que de lancer des ventes directement, nous avons déterminé qu’une campagne de financement serait un atout autant pour les donateurs que notre entreprise. Vous épargnez ±50$ sur le prix régulier : vous payez 125$ (109,99+txs) au lieu de 175$ (149,99$+txs). Vous avez également l’occasion d’obtenir des récompenses uniques et gratuites à cette campagne, qui seront vendues en option par la suite.Pour notre entreprise, la présente campagne sert à générer des ventes pour soutenir le développement de la Lanterne -  Luminaris.

 DÉFIS ET RISQUESEn commandant d’AscensionX, vos risques sont faibles pour plusieurs raisons. Ce projet est avancée, nous nous sommes concentrés à finaliser ce projet que nous avions entamé en 2019 dans les derniers mois.Tout d’abord, la phase de prototypage est complétée. Nous avons produit 10 versions du modèle classique pour tester le style et la résistance. Nous avons développé et testé plusieurs types d’électronique, ainsi que d’alimentation. Nous pouvons ainsi offrir ces deux choix (RGB ou flammes-simulées) avec une longue durée de vie de la pile. Au moment actuel, nous finalisons des ajustements mineurs (sélectionner un bouton d’allumage adapté, confirmer les prix pour les DEL et autres composantes selon certains volumes d’achat, etc.), ainsi qu’à compléter le guide d’utilisation complet (version papier/digitale, mais aussi une version vidéo).Nous croyons avoir mis en place les éléments nécessaires pour répondre à une vaste demande. Pour ce qui est de la production, les équipements que nous avons au moment actuel nous permettent de produire entre 50 et 75 lanternes par semaine. En cas de besoin, nous avons déjà négocié des ententes pour acquérir les équipements nécessaires pour augmenter notre production. Nous pouvons lancer en quelques jours la production des parties extérieures et décoratives de la lanterne. Pour l’électronique, nous avons un stock pour débuter la production, mais les commandes nous permettrons d’effectuer un achat important.Notre principal défi est d’offrir ce produit unique fabriqué au Canada, tout en réduisant nos coûts au maximum pour le vendre à un prix compétitif. Pour y parvenir, la campagne a pour objectif de garantir un volume de vente pour nous permettre d’acheter en grande quantité directement de fournisseurs/distributeurs.Le principal risque concerne l’approvisionnement dans cette période particulière. Bien que nous placions d’importants efforts pour acheter de fournisseurs ou distributeurs locaux, la majorité des composantes électroniques sont originalement produites en dehors de l’Amérique. Ainsi, que ce soit notre vendeur en Asie ou le distributeur local, il existe des risques de délai de réception de ces marchandises en raison de la Covid-19. Cependant, cela n’entraîne pas de risques quant à la réalisation du projet, seulement en termes d’un délai en cas de retard de livraison. HISTOIREAscensionX est une compagnie montréalaise se spécialisant dans l'innovation. Elle offre un service de conseils autant aux petites et moyennes entreprises qu'aux particuliers pour la production d'objets et d'accessoires en impression 3D et intégration d'électroniques.Le large éventail de connaissances de son équipe permet de desservir des domaines variés comprenant le domaine artistique (art, humoristes), télévisuel (télévision, publicité), l’évènementiel (escape room, fan art, cosplay, grandeur nature, produits promotionnels) et l’ingénierie (design de pièces, prototypage, production de séries, etc). Vous avez un projet en tête? Nous avons la solution.Depuis près de 20 ans, les cofondateurs sont impliqués dans les domaines de l’événementiel ludique et la création d’équipements, d’accessoires et de décors. Dans le cadre d’AscensionX, l’équipe réalise des contrats à temps plein depuis 2 ans en design et en fabrication avec de l’équipement d’impression 3D. L’équipe a toujours été proche du domaine du grandeur nature, mais aussi des univers fantastiques et créatifs. Cette expérience en conception, impression 3D et en électronique, combiné à l’intérêt pour ces univers a donné l’idée de créer un produit unique : la lanterne Luminaris.  NOTRE ÉQUIPEDans leurs cheminements individuels, les quatre cofondateurs de l’entreprise se sont intéressés aux nouvelles technologies, à la sphère de l’événementiel et à la recherche. Nicolas Fournier - Chef des opérations / Spécialiste technique - possède une formation multidisciplinaire dans les technologies (technique en génie mécanique) et en recherche (doctorant en histoire). Dans ses temps libres, il mit sur pied et coordonna des activités ludiques et éducatives pour engendrer l’apprentissage par le jeu (grandeur nature), méritant de nombreux prix/nominations (Concours québécois en entrepreneuriat, Chambre des Communes du Canada, ainsi qu'au concours Mon Entreprise de l'UQÀM). Miguel Gagnon - Chargé de projet / Spécialiste en électronique - a complété un baccalauréat en génie aérospatial à Polytechnique Montréal avant de poursuivre sa formation à la maîtrise en recherche en simulation numérique de phénomènes multiphysiques. Il a été impliqué dans plusieurs projets technologiques, notamment en tant que directeur technique puis directeur général d’Oronos. Il possède des connaissances en programmation, en modélisation 3D, en design de systèmes ainsi qu’en conception électronique et électrique.Marie-Pier Théberge - Chef du marketing / Artiste de concept - est une artiste d’art actuel, possédant des études au doctorat en études et pratiques des arts à l’Université du Québec à Montréal. Sa pratique artistique fait l’objet d’installations multidisciplinaires qui hybrident des œuvres sculpturales, performatives, picturales et numériques. Elle réalisa des projets de graphisme commercial et des collaborations avec des artistes de plusieurs milieux (logos, graphisme, figurines de collection, etc.).Dans le même axe que cette dernière, Guillaume Bourdon - Responsable des réseaux sociaux / Spécialiste en production - possède sa maîtrise en arts visuels et médiatiques à l’UQAM. Guillaume est spécialiste des nouveaux médias, tels que la photographie, la vidéo numérique, la programmation et l’installation interactive, ainsi que de techniques traditionnelles comme le dessin, la peinture et la sculpture. Ses projets artistiques exploitent l’impression 3D, la réalité virtuelle et augmentée, ainsi que les nouvelles technologies.  NOS RÉUSSITESNotre campagne de socio-financement GoFundMe réussie de mars 2020Mars 2020 : en constatant les besoins criants en matière de respirateurs artificiels, nous avons récolté 2300$ (sur un objectif de 2000$) pour participer au concours « Code Life Ventilator Challenge », lancé par fondation de l’hôpital général de Montréal, en collaboration avec l’Institut de recherche du Centre universitaire de santé McGill. Le but : créer un respirateur artificiel simple, peu couteux et facilement fabricable. Plus de 1060 organisations du monde entier ont participé, dont certaines constituées de groupes de recherche du domaine médical et des entreprises reconnues. Nous avons été parmi les 60 finalistes du concours. Au moment actuel, les deux premières phases de prototypage sont complétées, nous en sommes aux tests de durée et à l’amélioration de la programmation de l’appareil. Vous pouvez voir notre campagne sur GoFundMe: gofundme.com/f/sauvons-chaque-vieNos réalisations

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Since 2012-2013</strong></p>
<p>“After the Easter holiday of 2012 my friends and I were driving back home from the Finnish Lapland where we had been snowboarding and partying for several days. The road trip was long and tiring. Although I was tired after all our activities, I just couldn’t fall asleep. My head was bouncing from one side to the other, against the car window and back to the other side. I borrowed an inflatable neck pillow from one of my friends. That was a little bit better but I was still too uncomfortable to sleep. I couldn’t completely rest my head sideways with the poor lateral support and when my head was tilting forward, the pillow offered almost no support at all. I tried turning the pillow around backwards, but then with the pressure on my throat I felt I was choking.</p>
<p>“In those desperate, tired hours I started to wonder if there could be more innovative way of handling the situation. I Imagined an inflatable pillow which could wrap around the front, sides, and back of my head, somewhat like a helmet. To inflate the borrowed pillow, I had to huff and puff, then keep the air in while closing the plug when blowing air from my mouth. It was just too messy and annoying. I began to imagine a pump to inflate my ideal pillow.</p>
<p>“After being awake some twelve hours in a car, I finally arrived home and managed to get a good long sleep. I woke up well rested but my idea of the ideal travel pillow still kept buzzing in my head.</p>
<p>“Eventually I sat down and started sketching my idea. I got carried away and spent almost another sleepless night, this time with great spirit and energy. The next day I called a friend who is a designer and knows about materials and production. We sat down and I showed her my concept. She immediately understood my idea and got enthusiastic about its innovation. She helped me with more technical sketches and put me in contact with people who helped me to build the first prototypes.</p>
<p>“Once I started testing mock-ups, I immediately realized that the air cushion system was really comfortable. It was something totally new and different but it lacked something. Although it was super comfortable, it didn’t offer enough vertical and lateral support.</p>
<p>“Thinking about how to create this needed support, I eventually came up with the idea of a hood-type cushion with diagonal straps on both sides. At that point I needed some way for the straps to attach to the shoulders. That’s the moment the idea of a vest with an integrated inflatable hood was born! </p>
<p>""Moving forward I realized that the vest could also serve as a handy garment for storing all the small items that we all usually carry with us when we travel like tickets, passport, and phone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571938451/yvgsh0nqc9lgh0zyuevu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“Since my idea was getting more serious and complex, I asked my best friend, who had a good touch for marketing and commercial issues, if he wanted to join the team. He carefully evaluated the concept and the prototypes. He quickly agreed that I was creating something big and he eagerly jumped on board.</p>
<p>“We worked on more prototypes, each working better than the one before. When we felt we had the right prototype we presented it to TEKES, which is a governmental innovation fund for start-up innovations that have global market potential. The people in the TEKES office gave us the green light and they provided an investment grant that was big enough to start the patenting process, plus more testing and prototyping.</p>
<p>“We continued working out the details of the development, met with producers for the various parts, and had 1:1 drawings and prototypes made of all of the elements.</p>
<p>“We started testing our product with various people including a good mix of genders, ages, body types, and nationalities. Our testers’ general reaction was ‘WOW! This is amazing!'</p>
<p>“People were astonished at how the Neckpacker system’s head support was effective without tensing a single muscle. ‘Feels like my head is floating in the clouds,’ said one. ‘I feel like sitting down and falling asleep straight away,’ said another. Those were typical comments from our testers and those moments kept us working even harder and believing more and more in the future commercial success of our product.</p>
<p>“We talked with business advisors and investors, always listening carefully to their advice on how we should proceed to establish and commercialize our product. Again and again we were advised to consider crowdfunding as a tool for introducing and establishing our product on the international stage.</p>
<p>“At the same time we expanded our team with people who had experience that we lacked at that point. As we progressed and our patent was granted we decided that crowdfunding would be the best way to get the necessary boost that our start-up needed AND to launch our product in the best possible way.</p>
<p>After few months we raised over 133 000 USD from other platform and IndieGoGo in 2017. Now 2019 we have sold our products already to over 60 countries around the world and the group of Neckpacker users is growing fast! Our team also keeps growing and have to say that I’m very proud of everyone! </p>
<p>“That’s pretty much our story. From a hazy idea born of a tired mind in the backseat of a car in the darkness of a snowy winter night to a patented travel jacket and vest. We are now ready to hit the market with the results of our innovations. We’ve come a pretty long way!”</p>

Since 2012-2013
“After the Easter holiday of 2012 my friends and I were driving back home from the Finnish Lapland where we had been snowboarding and partying for several days. The road trip was long and tiring. Although I was tired after all our activities, I just couldn’t fall asleep. My head was bouncing from one side to the other, against the car window and back to the other side. I borrowed an inflatable neck pillow from one of my friends. That was a little bit better but I was still too uncomfortable to sleep. I couldn’t completely rest my head sideways with the poor lateral support and when my head was tilting forward, the pillow offered almost no support at all. I tried turning the pillow around backwards, but then with the pressure on my throat I felt I was choking.
“In those desperate, tired hours I started to wonder if there could be more innovative way of handling the situation. I Imagined an inflatable pillow which could wrap around the front, sides, and back of my head, somewhat like a helmet. To inflate the borrowed pillow, I had to huff and puff, then keep the air in while closing the plug when blowing air from my mouth. It was just too messy and annoying. I began to imagine a pump to inflate my ideal pillow.
“After being awake some twelve hours in a car, I finally arrived home and managed to get a good long sleep. I woke up well rested but my idea of the ideal travel pillow still kept buzzing in my head.
“Eventually I sat down and started sketching my idea. I got carried away and spent almost another sleepless night, this time with great spirit and energy. The next day I called a friend who is a designer and knows about materials and production. We sat down and I showed her my concept. She immediately understood my idea and got enthusiastic about its innovation. She helped me with more technical sketches and put me in contact with people who helped me to build the first prototypes.
“Once I started testing mock-ups, I immediately realized that the air cushion system was really comfortable. It was something totally new and different but it lacked something. Although it was super comfortable, it didn’t offer enough vertical and lateral support.
“Thinking about how to create this needed support, I eventually came up with the idea of a hood-type cushion with diagonal straps on both sides. At that point I needed some way for the straps to attach to the shoulders. That’s the moment the idea of a vest with an integrated inflatable hood was born! 
""Moving forward I realized that the vest could also serve as a handy garment for storing all the small items that we all usually carry with us when we travel like tickets, passport, and phone.

“Since my idea was getting more serious and complex, I asked my best friend, who had a good touch for marketing and commercial issues, if he wanted to join the team. He carefully evaluated the concept and the prototypes. He quickly agreed that I was creating something big and he eagerly jumped on board.
“We worked on more prototypes, each working better than the one before. When we felt we had the right prototype we presented it to TEKES, which is a governmental innovation fund for start-up innovations that have global market potential. The people in the TEKES office gave us the green light and they provided an investment grant that was big enough to start the patenting process, plus more testing and prototyping.
“We continued working out the details of the development, met with producers for the various parts, and had 1:1 drawings and prototypes made of all of the elements.
“We started testing our product with various people including a good mix of genders, ages, body types, and nationalities. Our testers’ general reaction was ‘WOW! This is amazing!'
“People were astonished at how the Neckpacker system’s head support was effective without tensing a single muscle. ‘Feels like my head is floating in the clouds,’ said one. ‘I feel like sitting down and falling asleep straight away,’ said another. Those were typical comments from our testers and those moments kept us working even harder and believing more and more in the future commercial success of our product.
“We talked with business advisors and investors, always listening carefully to their advice on how we should proceed to establish and commercialize our product. Again and again we were advised to consider crowdfunding as a tool for introducing and establishing our product on the international stage.
“At the same time we expanded our team with people who had experience that we lacked at that point. As we progressed and our patent was granted we decided that crowdfunding would be the best way to get the necessary boost that our start-up needed AND to launch our product in the best possible way.
After few months we raised over 133 000 USD from other platform and IndieGoGo in 2017. Now 2019 we have sold our products already to over 60 countries around the world and the group of Neckpacker users is growing fast! Our team also keeps growing and have to say that I’m very proud of everyone! 
“That’s pretty much our story. From a hazy idea born of a tired mind in the backseat of a car in the darkness of a snowy winter night to a patented travel jacket and vest. We are now ready to hit the market with the results of our innovations. We’ve come a pretty long way!”
We love creating innovative products that help people simplify, organize and improve their lives. We are so grateful to all of our backers and supporters who helped us successfully launch the 1st campaign on the Platforms.  Thanks for all of your support!  If you have any feedback or questions please contact us through our website  https://neckpacker.com/

</div></div>","It started on a warm summer night on Lake Shasta when I boated across the smooth glassy water, looked up and saw power lines sprawling over the lake.  The idea to fly without a rope, motor, or jetpack intrigued me. By happenstance I met Dan McTimmonds the following week who also dreamed of building and operating a zipline tour and together we jumped off that platform and took the leap of faith into this project, Shasta Zipline Adventures.  This was almost four years ago and we are now getting ready to ask our community, state, and eco-adventurists alike to help us build a top notch zipline course for all to experience and enjoy the beauty of Northern California and Lake Shasta. If you have ever imagined soaring through the air amidst four to six hundred year old trees, and experiencing nature from a different point of view, then Shasta Zipline Adventures is for you!  The tour will be comprised of a series of wire rope cables and sky bridges interconnected through the old-growth trees located in the backyard of the Shasta-Trinity Wilderness Area. It is designed to provide an easy and safe but high-adventure experience that will also educate visitors about the local environment and ecology of the forest. All groups will be accompanied by certified, professional guides.  We strive to create an atmosphere where our guests feel comfortable and enjoy a laid back experience and we know this comes from good quality staff members. We will operate near Lakehead, CA which offers easy access to all from Interstate 5.
Making memories for a lifetime with Shasta Zipline Adventures
Who
we are
I’m Jason Vine and together
with Dan McTimmonds, we are working together to make our dream of a zipline course and outdoor adventure experience a  reality in beautiful Northern California.  With our love for the great outdoors and our combined knowledge of the local environment and ecology, we are able share a  unique adventure and educational experience with the masses. Our vision for this
project is to give back to our local community and help visitors alike build memories that last a lifetime. We
aim to enrich our community and environment here in the Lakehead
California region. This will be a unique one-of-a-kind tour that can be
enjoyed with no need for special experience or purchase of equipment for the
adventure seeker.
History
and Current Status
The idea for Shasta Zipline Adventures originated in August of
2006, and since then, owner/operator Dan McTimmonds has completed many of the  procedures to complete a thorough due diligence process.  He has completed site visits to existing  zipline tour operators in both Alaska
and Costa Rica, as well as throughout California, in order to amass industry
knowledge from a variety of different operators. 
A 40-acre property near
Lakehead, California was selected for the project based on its scenic beauty coupled with an economically viable location. This property has
already been purchased and bids for the Welcome Center Base Camp which will house the  safety training, parking and restrooms are currently being
solicited.
  

Where we are headed
We are thrilled to announce that we have obtained our first permit!  This is for the construction of the entrance to the driveway to the welcome center.  This is the start of something big because once we improve the entrance, we can then begin to bring in supplies for construction on both the welcome center and the  zipline course itself.


What
we need
We need your help to keep this momentum going and to fund a Media Kit to raise awareness to help pay for Phase 2 funding (the engineering and construction of the zipline course). Phase 3 will be for the costs associated with the construction of the welcome center and initial operational costs.  We are hopeful to be zipping by this fall!



Your
Support
With your support we will be able
to bring this opportunity of Zipline Adventure Tours to Northern California to showcase our local treasures of beautiful Lake Shasta,the Shasta Trinity Wilderness Area and much, much more..

<h3>Award Winning Historian Restores a Piece of Classic Rail Travel</h3>
<p>I have worked and volunteered over the past 25 years in the museum world restoring many full size pieces of railway equipment. My latest project, Great Northern Railway lounge observation car 1090, is my own personal railway car and represents the height of rail travel in the 1920s. It is one of the last of its kind and I have ensured this piece of rolling elegance does not go to the scrappers by purchasing the car as a personal project. The 1090 is in stable condition but is in need of a new roof and interior rebuild to transform it from the 1950s work car appearance back to its time of glory as it was in the 1920s. </p>
<p>Trevor is looking to raise $100000 to renew a majority of the roof structure and apply a weatherproof EPDM roof membrane to keep the weather out for many years to come. Once the roof is complete work will progress on rebuilding the parts of the interior of the lounge area as a start. If there is not enough money raised for the complete project, I would like to see a minimum of the roof completed to stabilize the car. I have assisted with replacing 3 railcar roofs in EPDM rubber membrane in past projects and it is by far the best way to go.</p>
<p>As a photographer I have taken photos of many spectacular places where railways go. I have chosen a few of these photos to become the perks for this fundraiser. The perks will be 8X10 framed prints, Mugs and a set of 4 coasters with a great selection of my photography for you to enjoy around your home, shop or model railway room. </p>
<p>Thank you for considering this once in a lifetime opportunity to revive this piece of railway history. I understand that not all people out there can help financially and I appreciate that. For those who can not assist financially, please spread the word about this project on whatever social media you have.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in this wonderful opportunity to showcase a piece of the past.</p>

I believe in a world where transparency is important and you know where your clothing, electronics, food, etc., comes from. And I am not talking about just brands. Since the factory collapse in Bangladesh of 2013, there have been a lot of improvements and insights into the production of clothing. However, a garment doesn’t start at the factory where people sew the clothing together; a garment starts with a seed, a cotton seed, that is put in the ground either by machines or by people.</p><p>Let us show you what’s going on in the cotton world. Together with a talented photographer, Reinier van der Aart (RVDA), we will go to China, India and America to show the stories of people that work on the cotton plantations and in the boardrooms where cotton is being traded, what are their hopes and dreams for the future? Do they all have the same goals or are they different from one another. Is cotton life or is life cotton?</p><p>We picked China, India and America due to their supply of cotton to the world. These three countries manufacture 73% of the worlds cotton demands. In America, for instance, there is a large amount of financial support from the government. With this support, America developed and evolved their industry, by replacing most of the hand labour with cotton picking machines. This impacts the cost of cotton; American cotton is cheaper than Asian cotton. In China this is not the case, here there is little to no support from the government and the competition is killing.</p><p>Now, let us focus on what we want to do. During this adventure, we want to show you what we are experiencing. How? With an old school book, filled with the interviews, photographs, and stories we encounter and experience ourselves. At the moment, we are also in talks with a few companies to help us create an epic 360º movie, so that we can show our adventure at the presentation of our book, as well as publish this movie on YouTube.</p><p><b>What we need and what you get:</b></p><p>By now you might wonder: why do you need € 70.647,00? Well, we don’t need all of it for our research.

I believe in a world where transparency is important and you know where your clothing, electronics, food, etc., comes from. And I am not talking about just brands. Since the factory collapse in Bangladesh of 2013, there have been a lot of improvements and insights into the production of clothing. However, a garment doesn’t start at the factory where people sew the clothing together; a garment starts with a seed, a cotton seed, that is put in the ground either by machines or by people.Let us show you what’s going on in the cotton world. Together with a talented photographer, Reinier van der Aart (RVDA), we will go to China, India and America to show the stories of people that work on the cotton plantations and in the boardrooms where cotton is being traded, what are their hopes and dreams for the future? Do they all have the same goals or are they different from one another. Is cotton life or is life cotton?We picked China, India and America due to their supply of cotton to the world. These three countries manufacture 73% of the worlds cotton demands. In America, for instance, there is a large amount of financial support from the government. With this support, America developed and evolved their industry, by replacing most of the hand labour with cotton picking machines. This impacts the cost of cotton; American cotton is cheaper than Asian cotton. In China this is not the case, here there is little to no support from the government and the competition is killing.Now, let us focus on what we want to do. During this adventure, we want to show you what we are experiencing. How? With an old school book, filled with the interviews, photographs, and stories we encounter and experience ourselves. At the moment, we are also in talks with a few companies to help us create an epic 360º movie, so that we can show our adventure at the presentation of our book, as well as publish this movie on YouTube.What we need and what you get:By now you might wonder: why do you need € 70.647,00? Well, we don’t need all of it for our research. We need € 37.500,00 to do the research, but this amount alone means we can’t give back to the people that believe in this project and trusted us with their money. To give back to the people, we want to give you the photobook as well as a few other items. From our calculations, we think the additional € 33.147,- is necessary to create the following products:·  Photobook (650 items)·  Logo cap from Ebbets Field Flannels (100 items)*Pre production image·  Men’s T-Shirts 100% bio cotton (50 items)·  Women’s T-Shirts 100% bio cotton (50 items)·  Men’s Sweaters 100% bio cotton (50 items)·  Women’s Sweaters 100% bio cotton (50 items)The mens and woman t-shirts and crewnecks are from a company that makes every garment from bio-cotton or recycled materials.We hope to sell more, but when we sell these we will have a bank balance of -3.397,-, so we are not in it for the money. We are in it for the change.The € 37.500,00 will go to the following:·  Cost JVK Consultingo   To pay the rent, wages and future projects·  Wage RVDAo  To pay the wages of Reinier·  Traveling expenseso  Flights, car rentals, train tickets etc.·  Accommodation costso  We estimate this project duration to be 2 weeks in India, 2 weeks in China and 1,5 weeks in America, during these stays we need a roof over our head.·  Other contingencieso  In case something goes wrong.Extended goal:If we reach 90k+, we will throw a huge party for the success of the project for all our backers.

With the satellite
tracking system, you will be located and saved thanks to the signal issued by
the GPS that we integrated in the backpack.

REMAINING CONNECTED WITH
THE WORLD

is very important in
the rescue process

We need means of
communication in order to launch our scream for help or to locate the lost
persons. The fixed and mobile telephone, social communication networks are
completely inoperative. With the transmitter stations included in the survival
backpack we ensured the alternative to communication. Fitted with coverage of
up to 50 km, water resistant and with a 30-day battery life, the transmitter
stations helps you connect with the others.

In a scenario where
the electricity no longer exists, we need alternative sources which can provide
the power supply to the communication and electrical devices. We included in
the SURVIVOR BACKPACK an efficient solar charger, water and bad weather
resistant.

You can survive without
food for 3 weeks!  


In an extreme
situation, you will need every single drop of energy, the unique source of the
energy consisting in the food. The natural resources may save you, but you have
to know how to use them and to have the minimum equipment for this purpose. Being
used during our daily life to get easily the food from the market or from a
nearby garden, we do not possess the necessary knowledge to procure it by
hunting or by other methods. To this end, we included in the survival backpack an
important quantity of food ready to be cooked, dehydrated food, a complete
fishing gear, as well as traps for animals.

The survival
specialists assert that once we have to deal with an exceptional case, it is
important to remain calm and to quickly analyze the resources that you have at
disposal in order to make a rescue plan, and that is precisely why we also
added in the SURVIVOR BACKPACK all necessary tools and equipment in order to
ensure the survival in optimal conditions, both physically and mentally. 
























1) What size does the
backpack have?
SURVIVOR Backpack was designed
to be easily stored and carried; as its sizes are 62/36/25cm, you may keep it in
your office, in garage or even in the trunk of your car. 
2) I do not know how
to use the first aid equipment. Are there any instructions for use?
Yes. We attached to
the first aid equipment a full user’s guide.
3) I did not acquire
the basic knowledge for survival. What should I do?
You will find in the
SURVIVAL BACKPACK an accurate, complex and professional survival guide that may
be easily understood. 
4) For how many days
will the food supplies included in the backpack last?
The food supplies are
calculated for 2 persons for a period of 20-30 days. 
5) Can I procure my
food by using the components from SURVIVOR BACKPACK?
Yes. By using the
fishing gear and the traps for hunting, you will be able to get your food for
an unlimited period of time. By using the survival guide included in the
SURVIVOR BACKPACK you will find out what kind of plants, mushrooms or wild
fruits you may safely eat.
6) What should I do if
my supply of water ends?
You may use any kind
of water supply changing it into drinking water by using the water purification
tablets or a personal water filter straw included in the SURVIVOR BACKPACK. You
may also boil the water, making it thus potable. 
7) Is the backpack
waterproof?
Yes. I used for the
backpack manufacture the most innovative materials with an increased impermeability
so that everything contained by it be protected from the bad weather. 
8) I do not know any
special techniques of lighting the fire.
Do not worry! We
included in this backpack only tools that will not cause any trouble. We
included the waterproof matches and the fire starter that sparks even in the
most adverse conditions. 
9) Why should I get
this backpack?
This is a backpack
that can save your life. Imagine that a disaster happens without any warning
and there is no time necessary to pack minimum supplies. The backpack contains
everything you need to survive to the toughest conditions; all you have is to
take it with you while you leave that place. 
10) May the backpack
be a present for the loved ones? 
Yes. What greater
proof of love and appreciation can you show to someone if not the possibility
to save his own life?
11) Which are the
chances that I may need SURVIVOR Backpack?
Unfortunately, the
disasters, the terrorist attacks or a possible war represent threats that always
menaced the mankind, and in recent years, they got even worse and multiplied. 
12) To what percentage
would my chances of survival increase?
With no water,
supplies, defence, shelter and a source of heat you cannot survive more than
several days. But if you have your SURVIVOR BACKPACK, you got everything you
need to survive in optimum conditions for an unlimited period of time.
13) May I purchase a
gas mask or even additional pieces of masks?
Yes. You can find the
gas mask as separate perks and you have the possibility of buying as many as
you wish.
14) May I purchase
separately other components of the survival kit?
You cannot purchase
separately components, but you have the possibility of purchasing another piece
of SURVIVOR BACKPACK or even more, depending on your necessities.

compass to find my way?
There exists a column
in the survival guide included in the SURVIVOR BACKPACK which teaches you how
to find your way using the compass.
16) Will I be able to
use the tools included in the SURVIVOR BACKPACK?
Yes. The tools from
the SURVIVOR BACKPACK have a similar use as the household products so you will
not face any kind of problems using them.

presence in order to I can be saved?
You may use the fire,
the signalling mirror from the SURVIVOR BACKPACK, the flashlight, the whistle
and the transmitter stations in order to point out your presence.

build my own shelter?
Yes. By using the
professional survival guide and the equipments included in the SURVIVOR
BACKPACK, you will be able to build an efficient and safe shelter. 
19) Will I manage to fix
the tent by myself?
Yes. The SURVIVOR tent
may be easily and intuitively fixed and assembled, but we also included the
instructions for assembly.

<h3>Do you want to make a change in hospitality?</h3>

<p>Your own cosy dome with a <i>breath taking view</i>, air conditioning, luxury bathroom and comfortable bed makes the place feel better than home. This in combination with our barbecue nights, swimming pool and fire place will give you the feeling of <i>being in a total different world.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Sleeping in a dome is the perfect combination of </u><u>an outdoor eco-friendly adventure and the comfort of a luxury 4-star resort.</u></p>

<h3>Our Sustainable Vision</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Designed to minimize environmental impact</u></strong></p>
<p>When you build a house, you have to destroy nature and the house will last forever. Our domes are easily removable and are standing on platforms to <i>preserve our beautiful nature</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The American Institute of Architects calls the geodesic dome “<i>the strongest, lightest and most efficient</i> means of enclosing space known to man.” Its spherical form is composed of triangular facets, birthed from Buckminster Fuller’s goal of creating a structure analogous to nature’s own designs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546572420/dq7b9cmk4ombehx77ojl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our water and energy solutions make sure, we only have a <i>low carbon emission</i> and compared to normal resort buildings, our AsiaDomes use<i> 1/3 less energy</i> for air-conditioning! The ambient airflow inside the dome is continuous, with no stagnant corners, requiring less energy to circulate air and maintain even temperatures.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542897077/pne2klzhwndhfgrs6dxu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Designed to maximize social impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Many <i>Thai communities</i> around us are struggling with low income and <i>no access to personal development</i> resources. We will create a <i>“Development Fund”</i> to provide personal development initiatives for our employees and their families. In fact, <i>each night</i> in a dome that is sold will <i>contribute</i> to a personal development experience for a <i>person in need</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This resort will generate jobs and innovate opportunities for people who need it most. By playing your part, <i>you help to make it all possible</i>. When you back this idea, you become part of the very backbone of this movement. Even if you not want to stay at AsiaDomes, you still can be part of the reason this movement exists. This is just the beginning. AsiaDomes resorts will dot the Asia map and eventually span the globe.</p>

Your own cosy dome with a breath taking view, air conditioning, luxury bathroom and comfortable bed makes the place feel better than home. This in combination with our barbecue nights, swimming pool and fire place will give you the feeling of being in a total different world.
 
Sleeping in a dome is the perfect combination of an outdoor eco-friendly adventure and the comfort of a luxury 4-star resort.

Our Sustainable Vision
 
Designed to minimize environmental impact
When you build a house, you have to destroy nature and the house will last forever. Our domes are easily removable and are standing on platforms to preserve our beautiful nature.
 
The American Institute of Architects calls the geodesic dome “the strongest, lightest and most efficient means of enclosing space known to man.” Its spherical form is composed of triangular facets, birthed from Buckminster Fuller’s goal of creating a structure analogous to nature’s own designs.

Our water and energy solutions make sure, we only have a low carbon emission and compared to normal resort buildings, our AsiaDomes use 1/3 less energy for air-conditioning! The ambient airflow inside the dome is continuous, with no stagnant corners, requiring less energy to circulate air and maintain even temperatures.

We will create a “Development Fund” to provide personal development initiatives for our employees and their families. In fact, each night in a dome that is sold will contribute to a personal development experience for a person in need.

Even if you not want to stay at AsiaDomes, you still can be part of the reason this movement exists. This is just the beginning. AsiaDomes resorts will dot the Asia map and eventually span the globe.
 
You want to do something tangible to fight against the sadness in the world? This is it! Together, we can build a for-profit venture that creates opportunities and multiply it all over the world.

THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE CONCEPT
We are Yke and Gonny Kooistra. Together we have a lively daughter named Jasmin. She is our example to live constantly in the present moment. We are passionate to stand up for things we believe in and to make a difference in life.
 
In 2016 we worked in Thailand. We saw so many persons that needed the opportunity to develop their strengths. We saw many similar resorts which did not respect mother earth. We decided to make our vision reality to create social impact by starting a unique and ecological friendly place to remember in this beautiful country. By combining our efforts and hospitality experience we felt that this is a good opportunity to make our wish come true.
 
During preparation we came in touch with Emmy. We decided to join forces and work together on this project. Emmy has much experience in the hospitality branch in Thailand.
 
We have the opportunity to break paradigms, explore new ways of living and most notably: finding daily happiness and fulfilment by realizing our life project together with our guests.

Right now, the architects just finished the construction drawings and we get the building permit. In February 2019 we will start with the construction. The planned opening is 1 November 2019.
 
Reaching our goal of € 35,000 allows us to buy our domes. We still hope that we raise as much as we can but with this goal as a minimum, we are sure to move forward with the project.
 
Why we use crowdfunding? So you can be one of our first guests and have the chance to stay with us before others at a very special rate.

<h3>High Definition Polarised Sunglasses with or without readers.</h3>
<p>We are a small Australian family company who create unique eyewear. I work closely with my daughter Belinda and son Jamie on the development of sunglasses that the big guys should be -but aren't interested in developing.</p>
<p>Our latest design (A WORLD'S FIRST) is a super lightweight, dual moulded frame that features an adjustable nose piece. The dual moulding creates non slip temples while the adjustable nose piece can be made to fit all face shapes.</p>
<p>The 8 base TR90 frame and lens wrap giving the wearer optimum protection from the elements of wind, spray and UV whilst protecting the eyes from airborne particles like dust and road debris.</p>
<p>The frame features a lens locking system that secures the lens and also makes changing the a lens  a breeze.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534140678/o0wyupmbdg3c5j7rquai.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we are offering 3 lens options so we have something to offer everyone:</p>
<p>1) Polarised  blue mirror High Definition lens (Cat3). These are a general purpose or multi sport sunglass offering heightened definition and the advantages of polarisation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533789752/ypbbfl6pa87xn8d16wmr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The High Definition Polarised mirror lens makes driving a breeze by cutting down glare from the sun and other vehicles. While boating, sailing or jet skiing reflected glare off the water is greatly reduced and the polarisation enables you to see sand banks or snags under the water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534145320/qfh5phhrqcffpuy0q7o0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) Polarised High Definition Photochromic - these lenses offer optimum clarity  and are Cat 1 (around 15% darkness) in low or no light and darken to Cat 3 (75 to 80% darkness) in full sun. In normal conditions the lens will darken in around 30 seconds and lighten in around 60 seconds. This lens is great for general use as well as many outdoor activities - they can protect the eyes in very little light  and sharp vision (inside or pre dawn) through to the sunniest of conditions.</p>
<p>While motorcycling the frame will fit comfortably under a full or open face helmet - the lens lighten or darken as required with the open face helmet but will lighten under a full face until the visor is lifted - they will then react to the conditions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534146857/dmeub9uebqxkustew6rw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The high definition lens is great for hiking, running, cycling or hunting as the lens reacts and will lighten under the tree canopy and darken again in full sun. While playing  golf the high definition lens enables the wearer to see golf balls in leaf litter or in shady areas and heightens the colours of the grass enabling the wearer to see the contours better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534110103/wkzl0j7utlr0lyu77ph9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The polarized component of the lens is great for any activity around water. They enhance the viewing of wind shifts on the surface of the water while sailing. The silver shimmer on the water surface is greatly reduced thus eliminating eye fatigue while enjoying any water activity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533789831/cnmjz9g7gllocuz3y35h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>3) Polarised High Definition Photochromic lens with small reader lenses moulded into the the base of the lens. This lens uses ""WORLD FIRST TECHNOLOGY"" These lenses are Cat1 in low or no light and darken to Cat3 in full sun. The polarisation reduces reflected glare particularly around water and snow. While the reader component removes the need to have a set of  polarised sunglasses and a set of reading glasses. You can read a menu at your local coffee shop, a book in a park or prices on goods at the local markets.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534140126/vf6u3oi3at4dq38hf2yo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those who are optically challenged (long sighted) and wear glasses to read these make life easy. No need to change from sunglasses to your readers so are ideal for viewing digital screens like a  bikes computer, compass, watch, heart rate monitor, GPS or dashboard in your car, reading a book, menu or map, tying fishing tackle or working with small details they are so convenient.</p>
<p>                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533789684/c99d7jl1bfp5ohy853hw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have searched the world for a lens company who could assist us in the development and production of such a lens and have spent the last six months testing prototypes in all conditions.</p>
<p>Our feedback from wearers has been extremely positive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533789968/skasfvuodrgdx3tn3aly.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>By pledging to the project you will assist us in getting it off the ground much sooner than we would have under normal circumstances. We are seeking $35,000 to enable us to commence our first production so that we can ship prior to Christmas 2018.</p>
<p>We currently have one frame colour option worked out and would then ask our contributors for input on the two or three other colour combinations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Each pair of glasses will have a lifetime warranty and will be supplied in a neoprene case, with microfibre cleaning cloth and sunglass retainer.</h3>
<p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we would love for you to be involved in the project.</p>
<p>Over the last few years our optical innovations have been winning awards. Firstly winning the Australian Marine Industries - Most Innovative Exported  Marine Product in 2016.</p>
<p>Secondly we were nominated for a DAME Award at METS the world's biggest Marine Industry trade show. </p>
<p>We also plan on entering our latest design in this years awards.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years of so two major companies have been purchasing or taking over sunglass brands around the world - these two companies now own about 80% of the market. As the market is now driven by fashion and not innovation brands who were once innovators are now motivated to produce designs that  have limited life spans as they move into and then out of fashion. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Our aim is to produce products for sectors of the market that are being neglected i.e.</p>
<p>We developed the photochromic polarised photochromic lens with bi focal readers (a world first) as a large proportion of the population wear glasses to read, normally they would wear sunglasses outside in the sun and then have to switch to their normal prescription glasses whenever they need to read something.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have most of our tooling for the frame already  except of one small piece that is currently in development.</p>
<p>One company owns the technology for  photochromic coating (they just happen to be owned by one of the above two companies) they have been know to withdraw their raw material from the market for one or two months at a time. If we get caught up with one of their whim's our production could be delayed one or two months.</p>
<p>Our lens supplier is now stockpiling photochromic raw materials to reduce the chance of having their production effected.</p>

<p>Rio de Janeiro is without doubt the most mesmerizing city of South America, The city is famous for its beaches Copacabana and Ipanema, for the giant Jesus status known as ""Cristo Redentor"" (Christ the Redeemer) on the Corcovado mountain and for the Sugar Load mountain.

Rio de Janeiro is without doubt the most mesmerizing city of South America, The city is famous for its beaches Copacabana and Ipanema, for the giant Jesus status known as ""Cristo Redentor"" (Christ the Redeemer) on the Corcovado mountain and for the Sugar Load mountain. But those are just the most visited places.
Drone photography allows us to seek beauty in ways and angles that we couldn't imagine in the past! So after we began the project, we start searching for the most incredible places in Rio de Janeiro, that couldn't possibly be imagined or achieved with human eyes.

Fast and easy to fold into a small, convenient, compact size.</h4><p>One of the main features of <b>chedech</b> is its small-sized folding function, which is perfectly suited for commuting. You can ride many hours without worrying about your endurance, because you can take a taxi or bus when you are tired. And, when you arrive at work you don’t need to let your bike stand alone outside in bad weather, unwatched. You can keep it under your desk and then quickly unfold it for the ride home. <b>chedech’s</b> folding mechanism was built with time management in mind. We adopted quick release system and even invented new hinge system for the main folding part. When folded, <b>chedech </b>is secure and easy to carry.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440651790/agn18slrapmdgy9jkjco.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>2. Lightweight.</h4><p><b>chedech </b>uses a special carbon material that is used throughout the frame (main and rear) and handles.</p><p>All the major parts are made of carbon fiber, and that leads to a comparatively lightweight bike. For example, our five-speed model is only 9kg (without pedal) and the single speed model is a mere 8kg. (final selling bike's weight is subjects change)</p><p> This lightweight design helps you to ride faster, and you can also ride uphill more easily. Just like a good carbon road bike, it feels like someone is pushing you from behind per each stroke.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440651846/xvan6nhryolesupk6inv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Strong and Durable.</span><br/></p><p>We completely understand where to use carbon and where to use metal. For the folding hinges, we used metal to keep it strong for folding movements. For the other frame parts we used carbon to keep the bike light and comfortable. In addition, we use a stronger carbon material for the parts connecting the metal hinge and carbon frames. This is done by adding extra chemicals, which make those linking parts stronger than the other carbon areas.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440651919/leclscnspgfyvi1frkwu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>4. Flexibility.</h4><p>It’s commonly known that a carbon frame gives a much more comfortable riding experience, especially for long journeys. Many bike riders think that it’s natural for a mini-velo to shake and vibrate a lot because of the smaller wheels that rotate more cycles per distance as compared to standard size wheel sets, as well as of shorter forks. We solve this shaking (or vibrating) problem by using a carbon material, because carbon absorbs impact and vibration. Unfortunately, the vibration caused by smaller wheels and forks also cause additional physical stress for the bike rider. So, many people even think a mini-velo is not apt for long rides, but this is not the case with <b>chedech</b>, which gives the rider a smooth carbon bike and flexible riding experience. You will feel and enjoy the carbon body in each pedal stroke. The bike will glide a long way even you stop pedaling. You cannot help agreeing with top cyclists, who always choose carbon bikes for competitions.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440651963/hve1qzse3gfrxak5f1h8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>5. Sharp-Looking!</h4><p>It was not easy creating a unique style for <b>chedech</b>. It’s a fast riding carbon bike that is also comfortable. We could either show our bike as easy-riding with a more comfortable look, or we could show our bike as a fast riding carbon bike with a sharp shape. So, we were initially torn between the two design concepts, but finally we found a balance that we hope you like. <b>chedech </b>looks comfy and fast.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Technical Features of chedech</h3><p>This bike was designed with many technical improvement and new inventions.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440652071/nmrie6oqcxmlko220uih.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h4>1. Hexa Form of Main Frame.</h4><p>This clearly indicates our development process. The main frame has a hexa form, which makes the frame resist against a twisting impact. In order to make it foldable into a compact, small size, we adopted a one line frame system, not a triangle system that often leads to an unstable riding condition due to the bike being affected by twisting impact between the handle and the saddle. Therefore, it had to become a hexa form and also thicker than usual pipes bikes are using for their frames.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441070424/vhkkulejytpkdbq7h9rv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 24px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"">2. Chemically Reinforced Carbon Fiber.</span><br/></p><p>Our study group tested many different carbon fibers in order to diminish the twisting movement on the frame. We did everything possible to come up with a more stable frame, such as testing different fibers, adding extra chemicals, or adopting various ways of adding carbon sheet per each part. As a result, the final product has a much stronger frame than our first sample bike of two years ago.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441070477/ci72oqt3hukzwpdqx6yo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>3. Hidden Wall Inside the Frame.</h4><p>To reinforce and strengthen the frame to resist the twisting impact, we came up with a new design concept. A wall is inserted into the frame that gives more support that resists against pulling in one direction. This added a little weight, but it helped us to complete a dream bike that featured a one line carbon frame bike that does not shake while riding. We inserted this internal wall in main frame, handle post and seat post, and our <b>chedech </b>became more stable than initial models.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441070522/yl4hzgucxf6q63hbf3j9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>4. New Folding Mechanism.</h4><p>In order to make a more competitive folding bike, we paid careful attention to the folding mechanism. We studied the way other bikes folded and tried to make our own way to attain a more stable and faster movement while folding. The hinge between the main frame and rear frame is a new invention that allows speedy folding and unfolding. Special hinges were developed for this new quick release system. However, we are not completely satisfied with the current hinges and will continue to upgrade them into smoother moving ones.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442368349/ihtxnqhq1ibqwufbasam.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>5. Optimum geometry for a one size frame bike</h4><p>Most folding mini-velos are limited in frame size due to its folding mechanism, and they offer only one size, regardless of the bike-rider’s height. Nevertheless, it’s very important to design a one frame size bike that is capable of accommodating different sized cyclists. We were well aware of the shortcomings of <b>chedech</b>, which has short distance between two wheels due to the small folding size. If the bike’s geometry allows a large difference on the bike-rider’s saddle location per height then the bike will be insecure for uphill riding. This is because the front side will not be pressed enough with the bike-rider’s upper body weight. So, we tried to keep the weight balance, regardless of cyclists’ body size, and that made the one size <b>chedech </b>very stable for most bike-riders, regardless of uphill or downhill cycling. This well-balanced geometry allows a wider variety for the bike-rider and more stability.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441246761/w5uabfsugiuk0lysvtjf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4>6. Speed</h4><p>The main concern for a bike is speed. But this factor is forgotten for many folding bikes. Most manufacturers ignore speed in order to make the bike foldable. Impact absorption is often sacrificed in favor of small wheels. So, this foldable mini-velo is not fast or does not allow fast riding with added vibration.

Folds small in one quick moment, with ease.


Light enough to carry by hand.


Runs fast and pleasant to ride.


Absorbs riding impact for comfort.

= Carbon Folding Bike, chedech!!Strong Points of chedech1. Fast and easy to fold into a small, convenient, compact size.One of the main features of chedech is its small-sized folding function, which is perfectly suited for commuting. You can ride many hours without worrying about your endurance, because you can take a taxi or bus when you are tired. And, when you arrive at work you don’t need to let your bike stand alone outside in bad weather, unwatched. You can keep it under your desk and then quickly unfold it for the ride home. chedech’s folding mechanism was built with time management in mind. We adopted quick release system and even invented new hinge system for the main folding part. When folded, chedech is secure and easy to carry.2. Lightweight.chedech uses a special carbon material that is used throughout the frame (main and rear) and handles.All the major parts are made of carbon fiber, and that leads to a comparatively lightweight bike. For example, our five-speed model is only 9kg (without pedal) and the single speed model is a mere 8kg. (final selling bike's weight is subjects change) This lightweight design helps you to ride faster, and you can also ride uphill more easily. Just like a good carbon road bike, it feels like someone is pushing you from behind per each stroke.

3. Strong and Durable.We completely understand where to use carbon and where to use metal. For the folding hinges, we used metal to keep it strong for folding movements. For the other frame parts we used carbon to keep the bike light and comfortable. In addition, we use a stronger carbon material for the parts connecting the metal hinge and carbon frames. This is done by adding extra chemicals, which make those linking parts stronger than the other carbon areas.4. Flexibility.It’s commonly known that a carbon frame gives a much more comfortable riding experience, especially for long journeys. Many bike riders think that it’s natural for a mini-velo to shake and vibrate a lot because of the smaller wheels that rotate more cycles per distance as compared to standard size wheel sets, as well as of shorter forks. We solve this shaking (or vibrating) problem by using a carbon material, because carbon absorbs impact and vibration. Unfortunately, the vibration caused by smaller wheels and forks also cause additional physical stress for the bike rider. So, many people even think a mini-velo is not apt for long rides, but this is not the case with chedech, which gives the rider a smooth carbon bike and flexible riding experience. You will feel and enjoy the carbon body in each pedal stroke. The bike will glide a long way even you stop pedaling. You cannot help agreeing with top cyclists, who always choose carbon bikes for competitions.5. Sharp-Looking!It was not easy creating a unique style for chedech. It’s a fast riding carbon bike that is also comfortable. We could either show our bike as easy-riding with a more comfortable look, or we could show our bike as a fast riding carbon bike with a sharp shape. So, we were initially torn between the two design concepts, but finally we found a balance that we hope you like. chedech looks comfy and fast.Technical Features of chedechThis bike was designed with many technical improvement and new inventions.1. Hexa Form of Main Frame.This clearly indicates our development process. The main frame has a hexa form, which makes the frame resist against a twisting impact. In order to make it foldable into a compact, small size, we adopted a one line frame system, not a triangle system that often leads to an unstable riding condition due to the bike being affected by twisting impact between the handle and the saddle. Therefore, it had to become a hexa form and also thicker than usual pipes bikes are using for their frames.2. Chemically Reinforced Carbon Fiber.Our study group tested many different carbon fibers in order to diminish the twisting movement on the frame. We did everything possible to come up with a more stable frame, such as testing different fibers, adding extra chemicals, or adopting various ways of adding carbon sheet per each part. As a result, the final product has a much stronger frame than our first sample bike of two years ago.3. Hidden Wall Inside the Frame.To reinforce and strengthen the frame to resist the twisting impact, we came up with a new design concept. A wall is inserted into the frame that gives more support that resists against pulling in one direction. This added a little weight, but it helped us to complete a dream bike that featured a one line carbon frame bike that does not shake while riding. We inserted this internal wall in main frame, handle post and seat post, and our chedech became more stable than initial models.4. New Folding Mechanism.In order to make a more competitive folding bike, we paid careful attention to the folding mechanism. We studied the way other bikes folded and tried to make our own way to attain a more stable and faster movement while folding. The hinge between the main frame and rear frame is a new invention that allows speedy folding and unfolding. Special hinges were developed for this new quick release system. However, we are not completely satisfied with the current hinges and will continue to upgrade them into smoother moving ones.5. Optimum geometry for a one size frame bikeMost folding mini-velos are limited in frame size due to its folding mechanism, and they offer only one size, regardless of the bike-rider’s height. Nevertheless, it’s very important to design a one frame size bike that is capable of accommodating different sized cyclists. We were well aware of the shortcomings of chedech, which has short distance between two wheels due to the small folding size. If the bike’s geometry allows a large difference on the bike-rider’s saddle location per height then the bike will be insecure for uphill riding. This is because the front side will not be pressed enough with the bike-rider’s upper body weight. So, we tried to keep the weight balance, regardless of cyclists’ body size, and that made the one size chedech very stable for most bike-riders, regardless of uphill or downhill cycling. This well-balanced geometry allows a wider variety for the bike-rider and more stability.6. SpeedThe main concern for a bike is speed. But this factor is forgotten for many folding bikes. Most manufacturers ignore speed in order to make the bike foldable. Impact absorption is often sacrificed in favor of small wheels. So, this foldable mini-velo is not fast or does not allow fast riding with added vibration. But you don’t need to worry about losing speed with foldable mini-velo now. With chedech’s anti-twist main frame design, you can run fast as much as you do with carbon road bike. Most testers started their review with one sentence, that they could feel the riding emotion when they usually have with a carbon road bike, and we think that is good explanation for the final chedech. It gives fast and smooth riding condition.7. WeightAll bike designers are stressed-out about weight, especially with folding bike designs. A lighter bike is often the reason someone buys.

(Plus d'infos sur le coté droite de la page)  Pour les indécis, pourquoi la voile ?La navigation à voile est un moyen de transport non-polluant parce que le vent l’est aussi. Cela demande bien sûr des compétences particulières comme utiliser la radio ou lire une carte mais c’est comme le sens du vent : ça s’apprend ! La voile, c’est aussi l’expérience de faire partie d’un équipage, d’y trouver sa place et de pouvoir donner le meilleur de soi-même avec les autres. Plus que cela, c’est aussi l’apprentissage d’un mode de vie nomade et autarcique : pêche local et responsable. Le tout dans ce que la nature a laissé de mieux préservé : l’immensité bleue de ses mers et de ses océans sera toujours l’occasion d’un sentiment unique de liberté. A vous de former votre équipage et d'embarquer dans l'aventure !",2.0,0,"1 Campaign
